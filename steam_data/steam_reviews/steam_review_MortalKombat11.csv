betrayed by everyone around him in the same game

gets killed by epic progressive and empowered black female in his own reveal trailer

beaten up and shamed in front of his entire populous numerous times in MK 11

perma-crippled and possibly never going to be in another MK game while forced to give up his throne because he cant walk anymore (and wasnt even granted death by combat)

nerfed to bottom 3 in the MK 11 comp tier list despite being both balanced and powerful in X (totems and sunbeam are completely useless in 11)

they improved my favorite characters personality in MK 11 just to push his face into the dirt and it makes me sad :(

I recommend purchasing this game when it is on sale and trying it out for a few hours before buying Aftermath and the fighter DLCs. Mortal Kombat 11 is on its way to being a 2 year old game anyway.

20,77087565,english,"The most surprising thing about Mortal Kombat 11 is just how good the story is. It feels like an Avengers movie - it even plays out like Infinity War - except in the Mortal Kombat universe the characters are much less annoying, and they have no trouble matching aggression. The goodies in this one are every bit as rough and violent as the baddies.

The writing is solid throughout, most of the jokes are actually funny, and the action scenes are extremely well thought out. Some of the fighting in the Tarkatan war camp feels like watching a David Leitch movie. 

It has roughly the same amount of CG as a Marvel movie, but the animation is so good it allows the models to do real acting, and that acting is strong and earnest, even when people are discussing really dumb things like cyber ninjas, netherrealms or elder gods. Sure, there are a few plot holes along the way, and it plays a little fast and loose with the mechanics of time travel, but that only adds to the B-movie feel of the whole thing.

I also like what it does with the gameplay. I had gotten used to fighting games as masturbatory aids for nerds who wanna input impossible combos with impossible precision, impossibly fast, but the recent Mortal Kombats and Injustices have finally managed to flip the script so no matter what you do, the fighting looks and feels exciting.

The only real disappointment is the last fight in the story, where you get cheesed by an overpowered boss, and have to cheese her back to win. It's a really dumb way to vandalize what had been a pretty much perfect experience, and I was surprised that NetherRealm would get it so wrong after nailing pretty much everything up to that point.

Stupid cheesy Kronika aside, Mortal Kombat 11 is the best AAA game I've played in a very long time.

55,54895572,english,"The game is great, but the online matchmaking is frustrating. matches are quick to find, but not regulated by skill level. With only 165 hours invested in the game, I categorize as an amateur player. There are so many try-hards and the system matches new and inexperienced players with pros without giving a chance to decline a battle or give the new players any sort of handicap. If NetherRealm studios were to incorporate a system to aid new players, I would feel much more comfortable with the game and inviting friends.


--Edit--

After spending almost 500 hours in Mortal Kombat 11, there are still things that make me reluctant to open the game.


I still feel that the matchmaking system could use some tweaking. It gets frustrating that there is no way to put a filter on the online experience other than ‚ÄúKompetitive‚Äù, ‚ÄúKing of the hill‚Äù, ‚ÄúKasual‚Äù, or ‚Äúprivate matches‚Äù. I would love to have an experience where I am able to filter out different possible players based on ranking in the game and/or their past playing experience. To add this to the Queueing system, it would make it easier to assess whether you have a fair chance of winning, or whether you‚Äôll get smoked by a pro or spammer rather than trying to guess by a percentage number. Additionally, this function could possibly allow for NRS to incorporate PC into the cross-play system that PS4 and Xbox share at the moment.

The second problem that has been happening a lot more often is an issue where after each new update, a different fighting stage on my computer becomes corrupted, requiring for me to need to ""verify game integrity"" and install/replace the parts of the code that become corrupt.

Disappointed, wanted to play beautiful and sexy Kitana, but in MK11 they made her look dead like a zombie. Same for Liu Kang and some other characters. Dev wants me to grind for hours to unlock normal looking skins (alive looking, not dead zombie). That's pretty shocking.

There's a mode called ""Krypt"" where you walk around, and open chests (loot boxes). Walk, open chest, walk, open chest, repeat and repeat, I did this like several times, and unlocked lots of useless stuff, it's just a waste of time. And all of that costs in game currency, coins, hearts, souls, etc. Which you have to grind to get more. I feel like I'm playing a mobile game.

The game has way too much violence. I'm OK with blood, but what's happening here is way overboard. Many times I feel grossed out and look away when they show something brutal. What's the point really? Please add option to reduce excessive violence.

MK X has more special moves, at least for Kitana, and ""rising fans/fan lift"" looked more cool in MKX.

Also wanted to point out that I dislike the concept of ""X-ray"" (MKX) and ""Fatal Blows"" (MK11) moves, it really feels like cheating, they make way too much damage, and take too much time to wait until they finish. Please add option to disable them.

Let me say that I really want to love this game, but the fact that the pc version is so neglected makes me have to not recomend this.

It makes me so sad that a game that is so great at its core, can be so horrible. Its sad that half the time the inputs are misread due to some kind of issue with the connection online, where you have no trouble pulling off certain things in practice mode consitantly, but it then consitantly fails online. Dedicated servers would help with this. Theres also a lot of connection issues that pop up, and honestly its just not fun to play ranked if you get someone that has 4 bars but then goes on to drop to 100-500 ping during the match. This often times make situations that feel unfair even though the game at its core is well balanced and works fine. I dont have these issues when playing offline on consols, and that just adds insult to injury. And its not like the game came out yesterday and theyre still working things out. The game is half a year old, and thats more than enough time to fix these glaring issues that go beyond just online play, but it seems like NR really just dont care about the people that play on pc. In addition the game is really poorly optimised to a point that its almost impossible to get even on absolut lowest graphical settings if youre playing on something even slightly lower than the optimal specs.

TLDR: Online is not fun to play on PC, the game is well balanced and has well thought out mechanics,  but since the main part of a fighting game is fighting other ppl online, its just not fun. Also the game is basically as unoptimised as it gets",1556218701,1600818565,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198082845913,90,2,7895,687,6562,1602009833,,

In the Mortal Kombat series, 11 is seriously beautiful.
Both the gameplay and the combat mechanics are extremely great,
If I need to score this game, it's 8 out of 10 for me.
The game also deserves its good money, the diversity is the story part is average, but I liked the story more than the X.
The online part is fine, if you like these types of games, you can get them without hesitation.

Enjoy Playing :)

The game has been improved drastically as these 3rd variations have been smoothed out. The issues listed in my previously negative review involving meter and frame data being screwy online still stand. However, I think now I'd recommend it overall.

Edit 09/17/2020:

Ability to view an opponent's steam profile has been removed and Bogard-level lag switchers permeate Kombat League online. Steer clear of this game, NRS/Qloc aren't doing anything to address people nuking their own connections to avoid losses/gain wins.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This game is visually and stylistically the best Mortal Kombat game ever made.

This game is mechanically one of the worst Mortal Kombat games made in the 3D era.

The game is balanced around offline and tournament play (notably the flawless block mechanic). Online play has no mechanics to really compensate for the input delay you'll be experiencing. The game plays as if it's expecting you to be playing with virtually no input delay. You can still outsmart opponents and punish them, but it's far less forgiving and characters with tight frame punishes become monstrous online due to their kits being balanced around offline and not online play. MKX also had a similar system with tight frame gaps, but the armor system created a far more forgiving online experience, especially in regards to plus frames. The meter system is also extremely flawed compared to MKX's. In MKX, you had to contribute to the game in some way. Whether it was defending successfully or getting sick combos, you had to engage to be rewarded with meter for both defensive and offensive capabilities. Meter just comes back automatically in MK11 without the player having to do anything in-game.

Characters are also extremely poorly balanced. At least at launch; the game was being retroactively patched and balanced to smooth out awful characters up until roughly August or September of 2019 when the 3rd variations were added into the game and that balance philosophy was thrown out the window.

These variations had practically no thought put in to them when they were released and as such you see pretty much only two characters online now: Upgraded Jacqui and Outtake Johnny. Do I even need to tell you that these are the characters' third variations? As if the game wasn't already stale before due to flashy but repetitive and boring presentation and only a few characters used on the roster, the pro and online scenes are practically only Upgraded Jacqui and Outtake Johnny now.

It's genuinely depressing because this game is actually extremely rewarding and fun offline, like when playing at a local bar or tournament. But there was a clear design philosophy focused on visuals over mechanics when designing MK11 and due to this the game actually doesn't see much attention at major tournaments in the FGC. I mean, the game was released in 2019 and is not being represented at EVO 2020.

27,75710376,english,"Game is boring. If you're looking for a casual game and good single player mode then this game is for you. NRS purposely try to change the game mechanic into a weak version of Street fighter 5 neutral style. Most strings are not real. You can even jab out of some strings which is hilariously bad. To cut more deep into this game D1 or anyone crouching move is the best poke tool in the game which is a terrible design for ""high"" level. The reason it's so good because high strings are duck-able without blocking. So you can mash any crouching attack or D2 which is the infamous uppercut that leads to a ""Krush Kounter"". You will be doing this not stop become mostly everyone has high strings that start up. What makes matter worse they intended to make meta's strong. 

Lui kang with his unforgivable mid that's around 9 frames fast. (it's nerf to 11 but still.) And let's not forget about Geras. F2,1,2. The game reeks of character personality. Moves looks dry.

If you can somehow JUST FRAME BLOCK a string or poke you spend not only your defense meteor, you invest in attack meteor as well. 6/out of 10 for me. Visually is looks amazing. I love the story even though it was kinda confusing because they're playing with timelines. It's kinda cheesy. The krush counter system is by far the best NRS mechanic.

28,73376025,english,"So the short of it is this - the game is phenomenal but the online servers are completely broken as of 7-27-20.

Update: After over a month of playing this game for 10 minutes at a time I noticed certain times of day I can get a solid 1 hour run going and so I am enjoying what I can. I contacted WB Games customer service and they were polite but not helpful. The known solution to this problem is to reconfigure your router and even set your PC as a DMZ... no thanks. So their approach seems to be, you ""fix"" the problem yourself it's not on our end... even though it only happens when I play your game. OK. So still an amazing game just wish I could play it.


I was very impressed with the wealth of single player content. The story was fun to play and watch. The character customization is very cool, you're able to build custom versions of existing characters with personalized move sets and skin / accessory choices. You can then pit your customized characters in AI battles against other players existing or customized character teams. It's a very fun way to compete without the pressure of actually putting in the wealth of time it takes to master the combat mechanics in this game.

Speaking of the mechanics, the training system is fairly good at explaining those mechanics but in the end I still feel like I'm button mashing a lot because the rock / paper / scissors nature of many things combined with the speed of the game it's just overwhelming. That said it does seem like it's going to be fun learning and improving.

So the problem is this - The servers are completely unstable for me and apparently some other people. Now you might think to yourself, ""The servers don't really affect me I only buy these games for the single player content, I want to enjoy the story and do a tower here and there to unlock some endings and earn some koins for the krypt."" Well I'm sorry to say that almost the entire game requires a persistent online connection to those troubled servers. You can start a tower of say 5 battles and in the first or second fight you're going to be disconnected, forcing you to completely exit and restart game to reconnect to the server and your tower progress is lost. Try again same thing happens making towers impossible to complete so you can't grind out the currencies to unlock things or see the character endings. Some of the few things you can do offline after the server boots you are story mode and training tutorials.

Another problem I've seen people complain about and experienced myself to a mild degree is crashing. The day I installed this game it would crash every time I loaded it up. Tried about a dozen times and I was about to request a refund but it was late and I figured I'll get some sleep and troubleshoot it tomorrow. The next day I woke up and the game just inexplicably worked. I did experience maybe 3 more slightly irritating crashes since then but nothing too bad.

I can't comment on the multiplayer scene as I didn't bother. With the server issues I couldn't imagine the frustration of it.

So despite how much I like the actual game, I have to not recommend this purchase at this time unless the only thing you want out of it is the story mode then go ahead. I thought it was pretty cool. If they manage to sort out that disconnect problem this game is an easy recommend even at full price. This disconnect problem apparently isn't affecting everyone but know that until they address this issue you're rolling the dice if you buy this game.",1595884086,1599672065,False,24,2,0.64547806978225708,0,True,False,False,76561198002157299,176,6,5519,47,1350,1601186318,,

- Crushing blow = Alt+F4. Why watch a repeat cinematic when I could be doing literally anything else?
- The Krypt is insulting. It's not ""fixed"". 10 ways to gamble for bundled assets? Get this garbage out!
- They try to trick you into paying for Frost. I guess this means NRS staff enjoy mocking customers?
- Matches play out like QTEs.
- 2-button 50/50 strings dominate the available combos.
- Almost every string ends in a knockdown.
- Juggles barely exist and the combat system has absolutely no quirks.
- MK11 still relies on a block button and does not have any combo breaking mechanism. Every time you lose a coin toss your controls are totally locked out.
- Majority of abilities are enders with no extension potential.
- Damage balance is a joke. Find the heaviest string and repeat -- or lose.
- Towers are loaded with BS challenges and last longer than in IJ2.
- Every character has special moves that can't be combined in ability load-outs.
- Fatalities add nothing to the game and clearly soaked up valuable development resources.
- It would take weeks of non-stop play to unlock all of the cosmetics. (You know, the content you paid for.)

+ Tons of single-player content
+ Interesting characters
+ Customization options are second to none
+ Easy to get into
+ Rollback netcode
+ Pretty well balanced
+ An active PC community. Combined with an excellent netcode, grants us a game that feels truly alive - you can find online opponents in a matter of seconds

The bad:
- Kinda expensive
- Some characters are pathetically weak online, while being good overall
- Animations can be wonky
- Some interactions in neutral game make no sense, unless you're a fan of superhero movies
- No crossplay

The ugly:
~ Fatal blows. A lot of fighting games have that mechanic, but it feels ""cheap"" and overly oppressive to me in this game. 
~ Over the top brutality and gore. I don't mind it personally, but some people might find it annoying or inappropriate.   
~ Microtransactions. I'm personally not affected by them, but there is an optional grind for cosmetics, that can be bypassed by dropping a few bucks. 
~ Simplified special motions inputs. 
~ Gameplay tempo feels uneven. You're either yawning or trying to make almost a frame-perfect play.  The way characters are animated does not help.
~ Story (as in overall plot of the game) mode felt boring and uninspired. It's adequate, flashy even. especially for a fighting game, but nothing to write home about. Though, to be completely honest, compared to other fighting games, MK11 plot looks like an award-winning high literature.

- Performance Issues what do i mean by this ? Its simple if you have good frames and the other guy doesn't in order to make the game fair for him the game will punish you it will lower you frames eve if you have a nasa pc.
-Bad Servers if you play the game offline and then go online you will notice a small delay and combos will be harder to complete especially those combos that you need to hit the right frame.
- Microtransactions fatalities and brutalities are unlocked in the krypt you can buy them with coins, hearts and souls but they are very expensive and you need the luck factor i have 75 hours on this game in this time i only made 10k souls and wasnt even close to buy all of the souls chests , i made 1m coins or more not enough to buy all of the coin chests you also need hearts ( hearts chests bigger chance to get brutalities and fatalies ) you win hearts by doing brutalities and fatalities 1 fatality = 3 hearts  1 brutality = 5, each chests costs betwen 100 and 250 hearts do the math and if you spend hearts you may not get a brutality it will be just art also some skins you need to buys with real money you cant get them in the krypt.
-Censorship devs said we wont have reveling outfits for women because thats not a good outfit to fight in yet the guys are half naked also the devs need to watch the ufc and what these girls wear while they fight.
-Useless fighters you will be using only a handfull of fighers because most of them suck in 75 hours this is what i found online Kung Lao, Spwan, Noob, Sonya, Sub Zero. Kung Lao if he gets close to you he will pressure you until you die there not much you can do Jade she sucks, ( jade main here) Noob has great reach he can hit you but you can hit him you need to be close and he will catch get in and thats a full combo punish Riden he sucks, Sonya has some crazy 50 50s so its a guessing game with her guess worng combo punish Scorpion he sucks...

22,50302416,english,"So -- by and large I'm enjoying MK11 very much, the positives outweigh the negatives, and it's a positive review from me, but mileage does, as always, vary. Judging by the current response, anyway. This review is just a review of my personal experience with the game, and yours might differ greatly. Take it with a grain of salt. 

Maybe I've just been quite lucky, but I'm close to 6 hours of gametime in, the game hasn't crashed once for me. Hasn't slowed down, given me any trouble. I understand quite a few people have run into problems in that regard. I can't really review the game on their behalf, only on mine. There have been some audio hiccups; the sound in story mode seems very quiet, and sometimes loses sync with the actions onscreen, but pausing and unpausing tends to fix it. 

I've been playing Mortal Kombat games since MK2, and I'm very much enjoying MK11. The customization was a fantastic idea, and I'm looking forward to unlocking more and more options for my favourite characters. Gameplay is smooth and elegant, and the change of picking a moveset (as in MKX) to customizing your own is inherently satisfying. All in all, this is the most streamlined and fun Mortal Kombat I've ever played - and I say this as someone who's literally played all of them. 

However, that actually said, I'm not sure if I'll rush to buy the inevitable MK12. Without spoiling, the story mode of MK11 feels bittersweet, the end of an era. There were delightful moments and there were gutting moments; there were moments that left me moved, and others that didn't quite hit the right notes. The story of MKX is, to me, still the benchmark of best Mortal Kombat stories, it felt more grounded and and less convoluted. But all in all it was still a fun (and at times emotional) ride that was wonderfully orchestrated. (And yes, I'm one of those people who does play Mortal Kombat for the story, which I know not necessarily everyone does.)

The one thing I do feel MK11 suffering from is the new playable characters, which I just didn't think were particularly necessary. Cetrion is interesting, sure (Geras and the Kollector I find myself very, very indifferent to), but I think they should've been reserved for future DLC slots, if at all. We're not really given much reason to care for these characters in story mode (Geras and the Kollector in particular), and they're not returning favourites, so the inclusion feels like a bit of a waste of space. I'm sure some players will love them, and they may very well see competitive play, but I think MK11 stumbled by removing MKX's Takeda and Kung Jin; they were part of MKX's ""next generation"" and were very well received by the fanbase, so why leave them out? They could've been really outstanding in the story mode, too. (Where they make no cameo and are in no way alluded to.) I hope there's DLC on the horizon, but who knows? My two favourites - Kano and Erron Black - are both back, so I don't get to moan too much, but come on, don't set up interesting, compelling characters in one game and then drop them in the next (especially if you're keeping Cassie and Jacqui around).

Much credit also to the art and sound design departments, the game looks and sounds beautiful, very well done. 

So all in all, yes, I was lucky in that my computer runs the game without the problems others are experincing. I'm largely happy with it, though I felt it dropped the ball a few times in story mode and in terms of character roster, but I'm enjoying it.",1556120077,1598582789,True,30,7,0.549163877964019775,0,True,False,False,76561198116052377,151,15,16618,0,340,1594691968,,

I've never had a fighting game ignore it's own rules / physics to enable such a blatant BS maneuver. This is happening mostly in the ToT fights- which, by the f-ing way, are absolutely idiotic. The assist towers, for example, allow another character to assist your enemy but your assist konsumables are disabled. wtf? Why does that make any sense? I mean, the fact that you have to deal with special konsumable attacks itself is annoying enough, but the assist towers are absolutely and unequivocally trash kontent.

Game speed is slower than previous MKs, but the move precision is spot on.
Online is fun for the most part, tea-baggers are a little annoying, haha.

Story mode is fun, if you're a lore-fan like myself, it's good filler, also check out the comics showing events between 9 and 10.

The customization is great, lots of options for colors and gear set ups.
Also adding and removing moves if probably my favorite feature from any fighting game.

I looked forward to this game for a year. Pre-ordered the $100 edition and played launch day. Suffered the waiting 1 hour for it to begin installing and the long load time on startup but still loved it. All my hours are from the first week, I've tried to play again somewhat recently, but there's nothing to do. 

I made the mistake of playing this game to fast, I guess. I managed to complete the towers for the characters I liked and also beat many of the time trials, I was top 0.1% of players the first week and was sadly not given the top 1% prize since the PC Update messed that up. Whatever, still liked the game, beats most the towers spent all day and night to get all the heads for the crypt and opened all crypt chests. Then a few days later, an update rolled around to appease the children with the ""why do I have to play the game to unlock stuff"" mindset.

All the things I worked hard for were made easier to obtain. 
‚Ä¢ Soul Rewards increased by 50%
‚Ä¢ Fatality count for head spikes decreased
‚Ä¢ Community gift with 500,000 Koins, 1,000 Souls, 1,000 Time Crystals, and 500 Hearts
‚Ä¢ Increased amount of Hearts earned from Fatalities, Brutalities, and Mercies. 

Not only that but they also made the game far easier in said update: 
‚Ä¢ Modifier damage reduction for fire, DoT, electric storm, etc.
‚Ä¢ Modifier intervals in the Gauntlet increased
‚Ä¢ Adjusted AI difficulty curve
‚Ä¢ Further opponent health reductions in higher-level Towers
‚Ä¢ Adjusted and removed modifiers from many Daily Towers
‚Ä¢ Increased Koin Rewards for kompleting Towers and Tower Platforms
‚Ä¢ Increased Dragon Challenge Koin rewards
‚Ä¢ Increased post-fight Koin rewards
‚Ä¢ Increased amount of Hearts earned from Fatalities, Brutalities, and Mercies
‚Ä¢ Lowered modifier damage for many modifiers
‚Ä¢ Adjusted the lifespan of several modifiers
‚Ä¢ Dramatically increased cooldowns on Tag Assist modifiers

And I want to like this game, just like I loved MKX... But it seems I just don't. The longer I play it, the more I'm becoming frustrated with it. 

First, the grind is just tedious and not fun. It felt more in balance in MKX. You had to work a little, but the challenge was just enough to keep pushing on and being happy when you reached it. Now, it's just frustrating... You need this and that, 3 different currencies... You are no longer allowed to use skip fights on end bosses. So if you are really stuck on a tower, well... bad luck for you! It's so disappointing after having done all the hard work to reach that point.

Secondly, there is nothing really to grind for anymore. Most costumes are boring and look very similar. There is no wow-factor anymore. And the extreme leftist flavour to the game irks me as well. I'm a woman, and I don't care that the women in this game used to be sexualised. It's not like the men in this game have realistic standards either... It's part of the fun to become this supercool sexy fighter woman, who kicks ass. 

The game could have been absolutely amazing with those gorgeous graphics, but somehow it's underwhelming...
I regret a little bit spending my money on it. It seems I won't be buying any MK-games anymore. The game in itself was expensive enough, with a kind of blah story.

I LOVE this game. It takes me all the way back to when I used to play MK1 & MK2 in the arcade. The characters are easy to learn and hard to master, the environments are interesting and engaging, the difficulty is pitched exactly right to teach a player how to move from a beginner to a world class MK fighter and the story mode has comic book level intrigue and sophistication. 

So why do I not recommend it? One simple reason. After spending so much money on this game, I still suffer from fatal crashes. Even after the recent patch the game constantly crashes back to desktop. I have a fairly high level piece of kit which is more than capable of running VR (which is awesome BTW) and this game still crashes after the most recent updates. 

I'm really disappointed! I've been a huge supporter of the studio;  I've purchased and enjoyed all there recent games and the earlier MK reboots.

Jade serves as the female star in fan-favorite Mileena's absence, thanks to fast combos one can link both on the offensive and defensive and her spear varieties. Kitana's fan throw is also fun but her move set and versatility are disappointing. Sub-Zero's technique is rich while Scorpion is the weakest among all his past iterations.

Sheeva as a DLC serves as the sub-boss that is, to the surprise of most, unavailable for the first time in MK history, as a towering figure like a Shokan or Centaur. MK, artistically, as a concept rather than a mere capitalist product, diverging substantially from what made it what it is in the 90's and the creators seem to be all too happy with that. The amazing soundtrack from the MK2-MK3-MKT era is totally gone and the authentic characters that separated it from its competitors are being traded off for ""guest chacarcters"" that have nothing to do with Mortal Kombat.

Who the h*ll cares for a guest character in Mortal Kombat? A brand becomes strong with what makes it unique, for its authenticity, not by turning it into a circus. We're having 4K monitors, mind-blowing graphic cards, VR headsets and all but we have yet to see a four-legged Motaro in a premium Mortal Kombat game. He's dead in this timeline, so what, bring him back instead of that Clint Eastwood ripoff Erron Black. The developers' preference seems to be just killing off everything that was authentic to MK and feeding people with half-dead figures from totally unrelated ecosystems.

I also love how in-depth the tutorials are!  They are great.  The fatalities and brutalities are all gloriously gory, and the small little conversations the characters have!

They suffer from the same thing the story mode does.   It does try to mix things up every once in a while, but trust me, that gets old fast.  A lot of the battles that mix things up end up being incredibly hard, and the developers don't seem to realize that and most of the mixed up ones are incredibly underwhelmed with a medium difficulty.  And then there's the Krypt, which I started out hating, and now really enjoy.  Its like a little open world adventure game, and its map is huge!  I have spent two hours there, and I am probably not even halfway done exploring!  This thing is great.

I havent really played much fighting games in the past few years, but the transition back has been easier in MK11 as they have an extensive tutorial guide which will help most new players/returning players. It will not be an easy 'pick up and play' and 'mash buttons' to win however as i spent a majority of around 3 hours just trying to learn the basics in tutorial mode.

Lots of different modes for single player (vs ai, towers, classic towers, krypt) and ofc multiplayer (havent dabbed much into it but of my 5 games played in ranked my main problem is that there is a bit of input delay which can throw off your combos and blocks compared to single player).

42,73777147,english,"I've been playing this game for a bit and finally feel like I can review it. MK11 has quickly and easily become one of my current favorite games to play. It's a lot slower and more punishing than games such as FighterZ but it's mechanics allow for some of the most engaging and rewarding experiences I've had in a fighter ever. This is a game with a very high learning curve which lacks any sort of auto-combos or comeback mechanics, something which can make it intimidating to someone who's new. To be brief, this is one of those games you really gotta sink time into to get good, which works to it's favor as you really have to put thought into how you approach every fight instead of relying on the previously stated mechanics. If you ARE new and want to get better, the game offers one of the best tutorial and training modes that I've seen in a fighting game, teaching you all there is to know from basic movement to combo building and frame data. It's inputs are also surprisingly easy to get used to, and you'll find yourself improving constantly which makes the game all the more rewarding to learn and play. In all honesty, the only complaints I have are toward the base story mode which, although full of fan service and some pretty engaging writing, also has a few turns which were disappointing to me personally (Evil Raiden, you deserved so much better ;-;)). Regardless, I can overlook the base story's flaws due to just how much fun the game is, not to mention it's also one of the best looking, and best sounding games I've played in recent memory. Haven't gotten the expansion yet but am definitely planning to at some point.

""Throws are encouraged"", yikes.

Some frames are ridiculously safe compared to others. Lui kang will spam Bread and butter combos because the ending is too safe. 

Literally moves will either fly right through your opponent or they won't register at all.

Sometimes damage doesnt register, special moves will go right through a character. It's just a whole ass mess. Buy it for 20 bucks like I did, glad that's all I spent on it, and Nightwolf because native gang.

Mortal Kombat Now : Test your patience


seriously from gameplay standpoint this game is amazing. the fighting mechanic is awesome. the fatalities now more gruesome than ever. the practice mode is the best i've seen in fighthing games

BUT

it ruined by bad practices nad decision by NRS.

First the grinding it's too much. did NRS think we are just sitting playing games 24/7? what the hell with this mobile games practice? you need to grind for equipment such as gear, costume, etc. fine that won't be a problem except there's no guarantee for you to get the items you want even after hours of grinding because it RNG based. want that black jacket Johnny Cage? good luck grind on towers of time for god know how long doing same thing over and over again. the way the unlock mechanic design is to make players frustrated so theu will open their wallet to buy some time crystal or other things. if this is the direction MK going to then i won't buy anything from NRS ever again

Then there's the story
God where do i start with this? the story is so bad. there's too many dumb things like :
- Why Kronika bring back the good guys including Raiden which is her entire goal was to delete him from history and potentially ruining her plan?
- Shao Kahn turn into little b1tch
- D'vorah killed Scoripion. what with this blantant favoritsm of D'vorah? was their goal to pisses off the fanbase?
- Too many retcons like SIndel become gold digger whore all of sudden
- What the hell with that forced romance between Kotal and Jade?
- Too many characters that serve no purpose other than become punching bag (Noob, kabal, kano, Skarlet, Kollectors, Erron fuc**ng Black, and so on)
- They wasted Dark Raiden after teased him as a big deal at the end of MKX  and just write him off on chapter 2


And last but not the least it's plague by SJW bullcrap

Last time I played Mortal Kombat was during Grammar school.
The game looks amazing on lowest details, almost as games from 2015 on highest details.
I managed to progress through the relatively simple and short story on Easy difficulty just by pressing and spamming all the buttons all the time. Occasionally I looked at the special moves cheatsheet to get a combo or two.
The tutorials for training are awesome and although the game still has a similar feel to it as 15 years ago, the combat has much more variety and you really have to use your brain to defeat your opponent. The animations of some fatal blows, special moves and fatalities are just gorgeous, they feel very immersive.

97,73575045,english,"Mortal Kombat 11 is an excellent sequel to MK10 in both the story and the fighting mechanics. Many of the same fighters you're used to from previous MK games return, and they're better than ever. The story isn't amazing, but It's your standard MK story, and it's above average for a fighting game, so there is that. The DLC characters are also unique and fun. The game also features a story expansion, a first I believe for a fighting game. It's rare to see fighting games getting an expansion for the story, and I hope this trend continues.

The only issue I have with the game is that animations can be stiff for a modern fighting game, but this has always been like this with all the MK games. I thought it would have improved in MK11, but alas, that didn't happen. The other issue is that the game is quite expensive if you want to get all the DLC characters, including the expansion. Warner Brothers really ought to have a better pricing plan for their games, especially if someone already bought the base game and then needs to shell out another 40$ for an expansion that continues the story only for 2 hours or so and adds only 3-4 characters with some average skins. The game can also be very grindy, and definitely doesn't respect your time if you can only play a few hours each day.

I would recommend this game if you're into fighting games, especially fighting games like Mortal Kombat. It's a fun experience both for the single-player story and the online aspect.

19,73533461,english,"So having played enough to have an opinion on this game here is what I think...

Pros:
Game is visually stunning making every other fighting game look crap in comparison. 
Has a complete story-line that makes sense (somewhat) which is very rare in fighting games. 
Has best facial animations to date.
Has an easy to learn combat system (relatively).
Can be addictive when you start to master some of the game mechanics such as flawless block punishes etc

Cons:
Possibly has one of the worst European servers in any game (very difficult to find a game with ping lower than 150ms) making it's online one of the most frustrating experience in any game. Every time I press an input and the move doesn't come-out or the input registering incorrectly has been proven to be one of the most rage inducing experiences I have ever had in any game.

Combat system while easy to learn is very monotone. You will find opponents abusing down 1 or down 3 mashing and not be able to punish or opponents who constantly jump attack forcing you to block or try to neutral hit because there is no reliable anti-airs in the game. Every attack is either punishable or not, and some characters find it easier to punish certain moves than others allowing counter picking in this game (while counter picking is ok to some degree, I personally dislike having to switch characters just to win a game).

Doesn't have cross-platform gaming (it's 2020 guys come-on) reducing available pool of players to the same people playing you over and over again.

Tower mechanic sucks, grind for hours just to get a skin of a different colour.

42,73461743,english,"MK11 was on sale for 20bux. Bought it. Played it. I spent a day doing the storyline and playing 1v1 with a friend on Discord. I got my 20bux worth. It's like playing a movie and it brings back a lot of my childhood. I liked it so much I bought aftermath, played through that story too. Online play is brutal but I'm only 35 hours in, and it was the 1990s when I last seriously played MK. 

Technical issues. They exist which is why I am leaving this review. 

One: The automatic controller selection functions are poorly implemented. I'm sure it was a good idea at the time, much like that time you decided to wipe your ass with sandpaper. You had your reasons, I'm sure. I play this on PC with the a Xbox controller and Qanba Carbon arcade stick. Often, the game decides to pick Xbox controller when the wireless dongle is not plugged in. Sometimes the controls just don't work, regardless of wired or wireless. Sometimes the controls are slow. In otherwords, one of the most important functions of the game needs major improvement. 

Two: I was willing to overlook the controller quirks and enjoy the game. As soon as I had mentally centered myself on this fact, the game simply froze with a offline message. During a live match. And hasn't been connected since. You do need network connectivity to enjoy this game, buyer beware. Some quick research suggests that server connection issues are quite common and it's ""being worked on..."" or more clearly stated, this issue has existed for over a year and has not improved. I could have probably cut my losses before I bought aftermath, after all, I did get 20bux worth of enjoyment out of the steam sale, but I did enjoy it enough to put more money into it... and now I have a useless piece of software. Sure, it will function again. Today, tomorrow, next week... and I'll either be busy or I'll stop caring. One more soul of a game, rotting in my steam library, a symbol of first world problems if not a nice analog of ""YOUR SOUL IS MINEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!""

Finally: no, I don't have network issues or computer issues. I have a very fast network connection and a very solid computer. This stuff looks amazing on a RTX TI, sell your mother's car and buy a real video card, you will see this game at the full 60FPS glory that was intended... IF you have connection to the MK servers. IF. 

tl;dr If you don't give a shit and want a great fighting game that only works part of the time, buy it. If you do give a shit and demand a quality product, skip it. It's beautiful and plays well when it works but it has issues. Sort of like your sister, except I would never post a public review about her because she works exactly when I need her to and goes away when I don't. This game could learn a thing or two from your sister. Thanks!

Wake up Mr. West, Mr. West
Mr. Fresh, Mister, by himself he's so impressed
I mean damn, did you even see the test?
You got D's, muthafucka D's, Rosie Perez
And yer ass barely passed any and every class

Good morning, on this day we become legendary
Everything we dreamed of
I'm like the fly Malcolm X, buy any jeans necessary
Detroit Red cleaned up
From the streets to the league, from an eighth to a key
But you graduate when you make it up outta the streets
From the moments of pain, look how far we done came
Haters saying you changed, now you doing your thang

Scared of the future while I hop in the DeLorean
Scared to face the world, complacent career student

The visual fidelity has markedly improved but it is unplayable with an XBOX Controller (I have the Elite Controller).
I got as far as testing it out on the tutorial and the special moves took 5-6 attempts to carry out the required move, even when mimicking the actions precisely in the demonstration mode.
I cannot enjoy a fighting game that does not function at the basic level of control, so most regrettably, I'll be requesting my money back, licking my wounds and will most likely never return to MK games. Such a great pity, that a once great marquee game, is made unplayable by poor control design, especially when using a very popular controller.

63,73182085,english,"Oh geez....where exactly do i start with MK11?
Ok so long story short its in my opinon the best game NRS ever made. Its not without its faults but frankly the biggest chip on its shoulder it the pricing. The aftermath pack left a bad taste and there are quite a few decisions that make the game seem more scummy then Id like.  
On top of that the community is also an issue. There are many players that just sit there and complain all day. Granted this shouldnt really put you off the game but if youre already on the fence the negativity might sway you away.  While the somewhat closed communities are often really dope , it doesnt cahnge the fact that there are many people who will just make you want to delete the game and not look back.  For example people who pull their ethernet cable out at the end of the match to make the game thing it was a genuine DC and not a RQ. You spend about 10 minutes fighting these fools(with no way to decline a ranked match unless they are above 150ms) and when you finally beat their ass , they pull the plug and neither of you get points. These types of fools will fatality you and take your points 100% if you let them. So you fight them to keep your points but they wont give you anything if you win.
My final gripes are gameplay related.
Ill list them off rather quickly.
1) The breakaway mechanic is shit. You can get full combo punished for trying to combo your opponent. Its bs. Some cahracters cant even combo you if you have 2 bars out of fear they will die for it.

2) There are many clunky things about the game where youre not sure if its by design or because NRS simply has no idea how to fix them. Whiffing issues , weird interactions and strange phantom hitboxes exist and will likely make you angry every so often. It is what it is. The issue isnt THAT huge but its there and its not pretty.

3) Towers of time krypt and character kustomization all require internet to work properly. Its stupid that injustice 2 didnt need internet for multiverse but MK11 does for Towers of Time.  The towers came a long way since launch but even so they are primarily single player content. Being locked out of it because im offline makes no sense. Same with the krypt. The krypt has NO multiplayer components to speak of. It has no business being permanently online. Thats BS. Oh and speaking of the krypt. Every patch I see NRS pat itself on the back , saying they added new nether forge recipes. Nether Forge? You mean to tell me people actually use that thing. 
If you play the krypt at all you might get your hands on a forge recipe. This makes it easier since you get an idea as to what is even available and how to get it. The only problem is that you only get 2 out of the 3 components to each recipe.  If that wasnt bad enough most of the items are useless and the fact you cant take a look at said recipe while in the krypt is stupid. Instead you have to go back to main menu and take a look at your galery. Then you go back to the krypt to use the recipe only to realize you had forgotten half of em and have to go double check.
I do have a few more gripes actually. The kustomization is limited and I feel hurts the game from both visual and technical stand points. Its too limiting to call it freedom of expression and too free form to allow characters to be more bold in terms of design. With custom moves and variations the developers had to make sure that these moves can all flow together. This coincidentaly made it so most of them ironically dont and are just fluff you add onto your character. Variations are a hit or miss for MK11 (more so then X) Step down in that regard imo.
So it must seem like I hate the game. Nah , I actually love it. If you see too much bad here then wait for a sale but frankly this game is a blast. I love it so much. Honestly I think its a stellar game but it does has its flaws. Big flaws at that.

Wow what a story that was!
Okey for the start I joined to the series with MK9 then I kept going. MK11's story is outstanding with it's flow and connections. Just if you want a good MK Story experience do not hesitate.

[h1] Story Spoilers [/h1]

[spoiler] They just changed the whole MK9 man.. and they did that with an awesome new story. Story goes back and forward nicely. Time travel thing is well handled. It's an overused concept but they nailed it. Main Villain they placed her damn well in the world. Motivation of her is kinda standart though you would expect something more unique and of course it goes well in MK Universe because characters are well written but you know what I meant. [/spoiler] I can't say much more man.. I just loved it.

[h1] Gameplay [/h1] [b] Played with Xbox One Controller [/b]

They changed X-Rays to Fatal Blows and that makes it much better. You think twice when you're going to use it. It boosts the experience. Kombos and everything else is smoother. You can boost your own special moves with the right timing with a bit of practice that mechanic makes it easier. Stages are almost same on gameplay side. I wish stages were like Injustice though..

[h1] Graphics [/h1]

[u] On PC there is a problem about Anti-aliasing game uses TAA with FXAA and TAA and right now TAA is fully broken. It makes everything blurry and fuzy. You can smooth it out by going to only FXAA but then you lose your crispy image.
On consoles everything looks better for now. [/u]

Man they did this game on fully customized UE3 and this games looks damn fine. Character details are gorgeous. Face modeling is on point for me realistic and cool. But MAN THOSE STAGES AND THEIR CLEAN LOOK! They worked damn hard on those I bet!

[h1] A bit of cons! [/h1]

I didn't have a problem but on PC right now some people can't even play the game because of crashes.

I feel like the game's graphics can be tweaked by a patch a lot. I don't know for sure but when you compare it to consoles you can see differences here and there.

Krypt is looking like 100hrs of grinding at the moment. Developers said that Krypt chest places are different with ever player. (600 CHESTS!) but they also said that Special Chests are in there are on the same place for everyone. They need to balance currencies better to be honest.

Okey I don't care so much about costumes on woman characters but why are the male characters are appealing much more than womans? (on costume side) By the way I love their woman face designs.

[h1] Conclusion [/h1]

They made a another great Mortal Kombat game. Story hits on you with the right points. Gameplay got better as always they tweaked somethings. Graphics and atmosphere of it is just awesome. Needs some tweaks on Krypt. This is not a grinding game this is MK!  

9.1/10 Excelsior!

[b] Game needs to be patched on PC if you're afraid about that wait for a while because problems that are going down at the moment can be fixed by one small or mid-sized patch.

41,72780284,english,"Man is this game so badass, i will be honest fighting games was not my forte and MK11 was a unlikely pickup for me at first. I probably would not even have given MKX a second look in the past. The main reason i was drawn to MK11 was the graphics and man is it a beauty(for a fighting game anyways). Special moves makes you feel like a badass with creative animations and fatalities that makes your stomach puke internally. And we all have to agree that the mk franchise is that only fighting game that makes us care about the story. At the beginning yes, it was painfully frustrating to get owned online but practice and precise makes anyone a decent player. After having a good match with a good sport i feel relaxed whether i lost or won. But the occasional screaming does help to alleviate my stress levels after a long day. If your not much of a online goer this game has you covered as well with plenty of single player modes. This game is such a steal during sale but nevertheless its worth every cent for the full price.

1,72588150,english,"I played the very first Mortal Kombat when it came out on Mega Drive/Genesis and absolutely loved it. Time passed, I stopped playing games, I grew older, and just this year I got nostalgic for the old beat-em-up games I used to play. So I got a computer with a decent gaming card, downloaded steam, and bought MK11. So much has changed over the years since the first Mortal Kombat came out.

I'm highly impressed with the graphics, the gameplay, the story. It has certainly been designed to keep people playing for hours. But I'm old, I'm not a gamer, I'm not very co-ordinated, and games have just become too advanced for me. I would just like to remember a handful of special moves that I can do a few times and maybe win a round or two, but this game has a multi-chapter tutorial about how to build kombos and do certain moves in the time it takes the other character to recover from the last move you did... it's just too much. I have delved into online fighting but I'm just not good enough to compete against other players that seem to be able to counter every move I make, and do these strings of moves that drain me of over 50% of my health bar before I can get a single punch in. Even if it is a close game, the other fighter will pull out a fatal blow then it's just all over. It's disheartening to see my character lose over and over and over and over again. It takes all the fun out of the game. It makes me want to just have the original Mortal Kombat back.

I don't have the time and patience to learn every combination to become as god-like as every other player. It would be nice to be matched with other players that are at the same basic level as me. It would be nice to have randomised matches where both players are selected a character at random, so basic people like myself aren't constantly losing over and over again to players who know one character intimately.

Save your sanity if you're returning to gaming after 25 years of not playing computer games.",1594591792,1594593859,False,6,3,0.524465084075927734,3,True,False,False,76561198258822709,9,1,85241,0,72276,1597211838,,

The original story is about 2-4 hours depending on if your watching the MK11's movie or not. This isn't a ""AAA Title"", its a MK game, a very gamey fighting game. You have combos, fatalities, though with the microtransactions and DLC always there in the menus, even if you bought them show up to show how greedy NRS and WB really are. (Speaking of greed, if any of you preordered the game and bought the season pass like myself, the season pass is no longer on the store page. Great right?)

The real reason I am making this review is to warn others about the ""Aftermath expansion"" to the main storyline of this game. I won't spoil the story for you but its very predictable If you kept up with the story in MK9 and 10 or any of the older titles. If you are buying this for the new characters sure, whatever, enjoy. Though if your buying this for the story, I would say avoid paying the extra 40 you'll need to unlock the story. Its 2-4 hours of gameplay and movie. If you want a first hand look I will hesitantly put a link [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZt5ec-kNC8]> here <[/url] for others that just want to watch the new movie and see if it does anything for them.

My final words of MK11 would be to wait for a longer story of the future reboot which will be coming soon enough when MKXX comes out. And that's it, don't buy it, it really isn't worth my time or yours. Fuck the hype.

54,72404089,english,"The good: 
The game looks very nice and can be a lot of fun when you initially begin playing. Granted, I am going off the fact that I haven't touched an MK game since the days of arcades, but still I didn't expect it to look so good considering the overall game hasn't changed all that much in the look/feel department since then. 

The story is pretty good and again since I haven't played MK in forever it was something I did not expect. Granted, the story wasn't great, but it was a nice addition overall since I expected to see less. This game gave me a lot of fun play for a few days, which is nice since I feel I did get my moneys worth considering it was on sale.

The bad: 
The feeling of it being a grind kicks in relatively quick. You start to realize that the roster is rather small and all the moves etc are essentially the same with different skins and graphics applied to them. In addition, when you begin going through the menus all you can think is ""wow, there is so much to do"" but really at least 50% of it is fluff. The krypt is super boring and tedious, it offers no real ""fun"" since you don't exactly fight things and just wander around opening boxes up with no clue what is in them using currencies that can take forever to stack. 

After trying numerous gaming paddles, I realized that the game is very finicky about the button inputs. What I mean is that you can execute the button combos exactly and the game simply doesn't catch it at times. In addition, moving up to higher levels of difficulty in a game is normally a fun rewarding experience, but not here. The AI blatantly cheats and ignores all the rules when you get to the harder levels. When you do beat that AI that was cheating you and being generally cheap you don't feel like you accomplished something, you feel like ""thank god it allowed me to win"". Really takes the fun out of moving up, playing well and winning based on that fact.

Maybe I am just too old, but you the only way to open up new characters is by opening your wallet. Would be nice to be able to put the grind to use and get some additional characters opened up through hard work in-game, but all of the additional characters require you to pay more. Should be a bit more balance here in my opinion.

The ugly: 
The game seems to crash a lot at times. With some updates, it did get a bit better, but it can be frustrating since it seems to crash after you win a match and then when you come back, the win wasn't recorded. Not once did this game crash before the match began, or during another time when I would be more forgiving, it always crashed when you put work in only to see it wasted....

On another point, MK11 is really about the pvp right? Well, you would think so based on the forums ""PvAI bad, PVP good""... I entered a couple matches... What a bore... a bunch of ppl who have found the best tactic is to stand opposite the ring and block. When you are so worried about losing that you would rather play like that is just sad. I don't care about losing, just want a good fight, but this tactic seems to be the standard in pvp and it just sucks the life out of a fight. You eventually have two choices if you continue, conform to their tactics or get frustrated trying to force a real fight out of them. Go with the first, you get two idiots blocking and bobbing up and down on either side of the screen tossing out a special move here and there until someone finally wins. I went with the second and tried to actually fight, but it proved to be frustrating and annoying fighting a coward with powers.

Overall, I will recommend this game if it is on sale or once it drops in price. If I payed retail for it I would be frustrated, but it does keep you busy for a bit which is nice :)",1594345826,1594346123,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198088248628,42,6,5427,0,5427,1594342335,,

[b] EDIT: I refunded the game. The problem never fixed itself, and I didn't want to wait for it. Sorry NRS ): [/b]

In my opinion, Mortal Kombat is definitely the ""Go-to"" franchise for fighting games. 

Tekken is full of Tryhards
With Street Fighter, you have to buy the game 4 times to actually have an enjoyable time|
Soul Calibur is for weebs
Injustice is dead
Smash Bros. isn't on Steam
Brawlhalla is just not fun
Don't lie, you thought about getting Skull Girls

As a new player, I find the tutorial to be extremely helpful and well made. Not everyone agrees with me here, but I actually don't mind the amount of characters. You start with a good bunch, and you can grind the story to unlock more. Speaking of story, that's what I'm most excited about. The story seems incredibly well made, and I can't wait to try it. I normally hate any story driven modes in all games, but I am sure that I'll enjoy this. The graphics are great. I know some people complain about MK11 having less gore and blood, compared to MKX, but, I don't mind this. It's such a minor, and useless detail to complain about. 
So far, I've just started the story, and have completed a bunch of towers. So, take my review with a little inexperience to both the game as a whole, and the genre. 
Would I pay almost $100 for the base game and the expansion? (Aftermath)
No
Would I wait for a sale, get the base game for $20 and Aftermath for $50? 
No
Would I wait for a sale, get the base game, play it a bit to see if you like it, then decide whether you should get Aftermath or not?|
Yes

There is one thing that is preventing me from giving this a 10/10
The servers
I don't know man. I don't know what NRS are doing at the moment, but the game is not working. The problem isn't starting/running the game, it's progression and rewards. Neither are saving. I've asled the discord, no one responded. I sent a support ticket to Warner Bros., I got referred to a completely unrelated article, and my ticket was closed. I'm sure this is just a temporary issue, and they'll figure it out soon.
For a controller, I actually wanted to try and learn a fightstick. We'll see how that goes..

Oh, I'll give you one of those checklist :)

[b] CONTROLS [/b]
- Really easy
+ Suitable for game.
- Hard to learn, harder to master

[b] GRAPHICS [/b]
- Awful
- Bad
- Good
+ Beautiful
- Best I've ever seen

[b] MUSIC [/b]
- Bad
- Good
+ I LOST :Kreygasm:

[b] PRICE [/b]
- Great price
+ Wait for sale
- Overpriced

[b] REQUIREMENTS [/b]
- Budget Specs
+ Average
- High end

For those wondering, I purchased Mortal Kombat 11 during the 2020 Steam Summer Sale, where it was priced at $19.99.
To conclude, you either love or hate this game. If you're new to the genre, I'd give it a little more thought. Right now, I enjoy the game very much. 

[b] Thanks for reading my review! [/b]

The system is very simple and they have a great tutorial that, not only explains how the game works, but talks about strategy and basic concepts that apply to several other fighting games (something that most fighting games are ""afraid"" to talk about)

The netcode is really good. As long you and the opponent have a stable connection and can run the game smoothly, you are able to have an enjoyable game even against someone from another continent. That's not the case in some other popular fighting games.

The game's system is very simple and quite limits gimmicky play. This can be good and bad. It's annoying dealing with a buch of setups and craziness, but it also ends up limiting how much you can learn and express yourself in the game. Characters feel very incomplete and limited by their variations. Some more than others.

Also, their modifiers are fucking bullshit, and will ruin the experience for you in any given tower if you're unlucky. There are some gimmicks that should never have seen the light of day, for instance:

1: Modifiers. These are 100% pointless. All they do (Most of the time) is tilt the game balance in favour of your npc opponents. They can severely disrupt the flow of your game, fuck up combos and otherwise flawless victories etc. Pointless, shallow gimmicks. They should remove them or at least NOT have them in MK12, and if they absolutely HAVE to, have them in their own separate towers.

2: Fatal blow. Everybody gets a free panicbutton at 30% hp that slows the game down and looks downright boring. An easymode-button that just ruins the experience, and adds 30 seconds to your match.

3: Augments. They don't really bring anything to the table, pointless and boring gimmick.

4: SJW-ing here and there with some female characters.

5: Wasted character slots: D'vorah, Jaqui Briggs and Cassie Cage. Dreadfully dull characters, and two of them are carbon-copies of other well established chars.

6: Some characters are WAY over the top OP, making playing against them absolutely bull.

7: BOSSES IN TOWERS OF TIME. 100% useless. They're 100% countering you every turn, know your every move before you do, blocking is useless, and they are just way too difficult. You won't ever find teammates that are good enough to help you actually kill one. 99 times out of 100, you will lose. Pointless, too hard, and boring.

The new characters they added (Geras, Cetrion) seem like they were ripped straight out of the DC universe. Only The Kollector seems like he would fit in the MK universe. I thought I bought MK11 not Injustice 3.

They have made some improvements to the game but some changes are really bad like the new Fatal Blow system. The one thing I will say is better than MKX is the visuals (except for some really goofy face animations on Cassie and Sonya, almost as bad as Mass Effect: Andromeda).

Overall I'm just disappointed with the roster which is why I didn't buy it at full price. I'm definitely not buying Aftermath or any of the new characters. Please add more of the old characters we want to play with more Kombat packs, it really sucks having the new and improved edition of a game to just blatantly not include your mains you've had for decades.

76,54771043,english,"Updated Review (Originally Negative): 

Now that the price of MK11 has dropped so much, I would definitely recommend this game to both fans of fighting games, and people who live with other gamers. 

I've always had a soft spot for Mortal Kombat games ever since I first played MK Trilogy back in the 90's. The roster was impressive at the time, and  MK11 has included most of the favorites. I still have an issue with some of MK11's characters being locked behind DLC, but I think the base game is good enough to overlook that. 

The game delivers graphically, it's a brutal game, and if you like getting competitive it's great fun for local multiplayer. The characters are memorable, their move sets are creative and the overarching lore is both thorough and generally epic. 

MK11 includes a very comprehensive tutorial for new players, teaching the mechanics and strategies of fighting games in general, and MK11 even includes frame data for character's movesets, which you can utilise if you want to get really technical, for the ranked scene for example.  

As a bonus there's some customisation options for your characters too (moves / appearance) which are more for novelty (movesets are  locked for ranked), but are fun nevertheless.

Overall it's a great fighting game.",1566593655,1593933916,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198169443586,55,8,4290,0,4290,1566591815,,

79,72067746,english,"The one complaint I have, is how the boss character's round mechanics are completely different from all the other rounds mechanics with any of the other characters, also there is a giant difficulty jump no matter what difficulty you choose for only that one boss character. This isn't just for the story mode but in any other game mode. 
You have to beat the boss with one health bar lasting 2 rounds not refilling after winning a round. The boss gets two full bars (one per round) plus swaps with an enemy when half life, after you beat the swapped opponent the boss comes back in with the health that it had before the swap. Also non of your special abilities work against this character. 
I wouldn't mind if this round mechanic was exclusive to the story mode for the final fight, but having this in any other mode takes away the fun, knowing that the fight will be the same character and also near impossible every time.

Other than that lol, I love what they did with the MK story and cant wait to see whats next lore wise, Ive been playing MK games since the early 90s and this is definitely the best written/cinematic MK game yet.

Therefore, i stayed away such a long time from the game which significantly made certain female characters more unappealing such as Cassie, Jacquie even Skarlet who topped the gorgeousness list on MK9. But somehow the game somewhat fixed it within DLCs adding Sindel , fancy skins such as Jade's witch appearance which were copied by Fortnite as Hemlock skin on the past Halloween. It did not prove satisfying but still acceptable.

Apart from this, i am pleased that the game does not look repetitive. Honestly, MK9 and MKX got me bored after some time due to the fact they lack customization of the characters. In the case of that, this game looks so appetising. Plenty stuff bound to various body parts, weapons seems to make the game enjoyable as well as long lasting.

In addition, the game performs pretty smooth on my MSI GL65-9SC at high settings which surprised me a lot.

The last thing i am concerned is the amount of finishing moves, brutalities and such. I haven't practised any of them yet. They might still be insufficient as they were before.

Graphics are GREAT for a Mortal Kombat 2.5D game, the gameplay itself makes the game 10x better and it's worth buying if you like the series.

What else do you want? Time Krystals are EASY to make, have 3.5k already and spent 500 and most importantly: skins are 100% Optional and that's the only thing you can buy.

1 Year later update: Game is still great, Aftermath DLC is very well designed, really enjoyed the story and the characters that come with it are fun and solid. Everything is very balanced right now, even D'vorah is a solid character to pick. All in all good, maybe except KL since sometimes especially in low ranks you encounter those Jade spammers or those t-baggers. But after you practice against those characters that annoy you 5 minutes in practice mode, you can beat the hell out of spammers unless they actually know how to play the character.

This game is fantastic. It is my favorite cast in any MK game. The characters that where neglected in X make a return. Kabal, Noob, Baracka, Jade, Skarlet, Sheeva, Sindel, Shang Tsun, and Nightwolf all make a return. All the classic charecters are back and some newer ones like Cassie, Jaqui, and Erron Black. Some old charecters are back aswell like Frost and Fujin. The only weak part of this is the new characters I rarely play as the Kollecter and Cetrion. Gerus is my favorite of them, but he still isn't great. The guest characters are also great, Robocop and The Terminator are my favorite, Joker and spawn a pretty good as well.

The gameplay is amazing. It has a nice flow to it that other MK games didn't have. The redid the meters. They refill and there own but from I can tell meter burns are not as affective. X-rays can now only be used when you are bellow 30% health. Every charecter has a healthy amount of special moves and kombos that are flashy and easy to use. 

The story is a bit of a weaker point. I don't think 10 or 11 have lived up to the story of 9. Kronika isn't a bad villian, but I wish that she had more then one game of build up. The voice acting isn't bad but it wasn't great. The voice actor for Sonya on the other hand was truly awful and monotone. 

The charecter designs are amazing. This is my favorite look for scorpion. The women in the game actually dress cool, instead of like strippers. Lu kang looks super cool in the end.

On top of that you get a ton of costomization. You can get skins for charecters and change three pieces of gear for them. For example you can edit scorpions mask, spear, and sword. I have spent tons of time messing around and it is defenitly a machanic that should stay.

Then there are the towers of time. I both love and hate them. They are essentially the Multiverse from Injustice 2. There are towers similiar to the standerd towers in other games, and when you complete a series of them you get rewards such as gear. Some towers are easier but don't offer as much rewards. The issue is that the towers are full of artificial diffuculty. It is not difficult because if requires skill, it is just filled with tons if bullsh*t. The enemies get augments like they can shake the ground and deal half of your health, or they make the screen dark so you can't see. This is all so you can grind to get stupid bullsh""t modifiers for yourself.

Over all this a fantastic game that I highly recommend.",1592447229,1593626389,True,0,0,0.506203651428222656,0,True,False,False,76561198152967142,329,24,24208,476,1826,1601700662,,

GAMEPLAY: Very fluid gameplay with very little to no hit reg problems that come up at first glance. The animations are very well done and give weight to your attacks and get me personally hyped up when completing a successful combo, the fatal blows are insanely satisfying when you hit them and all are at a minimum 7/10 from just a brutally well composed standpoint. the towers of time also give a great incentive to keep playing the game and provide a good sense of challenge to reward ratio when completing them along side the krypt, although I might add that the game can get a bit grindy when going for coins to open chests. The sound design/voice acting for each character and their timely demise are each very well composed and you can tell that there was some passion put into each sound in the game, my personal favourite Character just going off of theme and voice/sound design is Shao Khan, easily one character that rivals all of the others.

79,50978081,english,"After owning the game since launch i can talk about the pros and cons.

Pros: The story is very good, yet the talk of timelines again is a little old after we just had that in 9. Some chapters are honestly boring, and it would've been nice to play a few from the villain side.
The fighting and variations are the best yet, it takes a while to understand which character and which variation is right for you. 
The towers and gear customs works almost like injustice 2, along with augments so you can really build a character with whatever you want. Overall im still having fun.

Cons: I'm not really a fan of the character imbalances, everyone who vs Jacqui knows what im talking about. Some of the gear is special events, I personally don't like that because classic noob mask and classic jax arms i believe ill never unlock because of this, you will never have all the gear no matter how hard you grind,  i believe thats a disturbing fault in the game. Some of the characters are preorders as well as the classic skins for frost, sub and scorpion. meaning you have to purchase seperately, big thumbs down. The aftermath story is good, but not 40 dollars good, and really slaps everyone in the face who been here since last year. overall the DLC characters are 6/10 im over the guest characters. Robocop, terminator, Joker, Spawn..... i never use these guys and you rarely see them online. one final not i don't like the brutal towers, you have to use items to have a fair fight. i find myself blocking and spamming my right stick rather than fighting and improving. i really don't like that.

7.5/10 i think if you're already a big fan you will enjoy this, but the gear unlock and character grind is a bit much",1559325128,1593374080,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198376341051,36,2,41813,0,2033,1594610820,,

24,71476326,english,"I've played some MK games: first, Ultimate MK3, Unchained, MK vs DC, MK (2009), MK XL. And so I got to MK11, buying at a discount, not forgetting about the Kombat Pack. After waiting for the download of 90 gigabytes (!!!), I started the game. And this is, as if to put it mildly, an ass. Let's start with the fact that I started advertising Aftermath. Everything would have been fine, but the ad didn't go away after pressing keys on the keyboard and gamepad. The mouse helped. It's not critical, but I wanted to rate the game in 2 hours, and spending about 5 minutes on ads is not what I would want.
I tried to play the first fight against AI, I was offered a training session. OK, thanks, I still don't know what the shield is, or what it's responsible for.
The story ran in parallel on YouTube. I can and will! I liked it so much that I write this review and still watch it.
I passed 3 towers of time. Tired. I liked Test your luck better than this is all. Then the seed of doubt was born in my soul when I saw the ""modifications"". We'll get back to that, so keep it in mind.
In multiplayer, everything is not even bad. Players are searched quickly, close to your level, so it does not bother. I have a question for the servers: in rating matches, either the FPS drops to 30, or I crash at the beginning of the match. There is another problem with the king of the mountain - no one plays it :( at least after 10 minutes of searching, I found only one room with two people, each with 100 wins. I plucked up my courage and decided to play... And out. Cool thanks, it was very interesting. By the way, I found this game only through the rooms.
There are still some battles against AI. On phones was Injustice and MK X, where you fielded 3 heroes against 3 enemies. Only here you are not even close to controlling the process, and you can only accelerate the course of the battle. Unlike the clumsy me, the bots always do a fatality. Cool.
Customization. I didn't get the joke, honestly. You can change only 3 items, as well as change the appearance of the character as a whole. If the appearance is still noticeable(I played for Jackie in the image of a Spawn), then these 3 items in real combat do not catch your eye. They can be seen when the characters appear in the arena, but most likely one of the players will skip the video.(Robocop vs Terminator was, what are you doing?!) There is a point with changing the AI parameters, but this needs to be sorted out, and I have 2 hours... Probably, they affect the fight of bots described above, as well as in single combat, but this is necessary for professionals. For regular players, the difficulty levels are suitable. You can also configure how the character will appear(Remember that one of the players will miss it), which winning move will be performed. You can configure a couple of techniques, as well as see examples of Fatalities, one of which opens in Krypt.
Now, if you remember, I was talking about modifications. They can also be opened in Krypt. I'm not going to say that this is an ode to fans with puzzles, references, and so on. It's all a hoax. Krypt is a field with random chests that open for different(!) currencies: coins, souls (Hello MK X on your phone), and hearts. In the beginning, you are given 100 thousand coins + what you have accumulated. I had about 50 thousand. Enough for 15 chests. In the chests there are appearances, parts of weapons(3 that I described), concept art, and small things. The key thing that interests us is that there are materials in the chests, and Krypt has a blacksmith shop. In the forge, you can reforge materials in modifications. You can also directly exchange coins for random materials and modifications nearby. Hop! The Joker's Trap!
The game has a LOT of items for customization! 70-90 appearances for each hero! To get these appearances, you either need to pass the time towers, or open chests. But most chests contain either concept art or materials. And materials can not just be turned into modifications, for this you also need to spend money! And some towers can't pass without modifiers (I found the Halloween towers on YouTube). Time towers give money for successful completion. But sometimes you need modifiers to pass successfully. To get modifiers, you need to open chests, to open chests you need money, to get money you need to pass including towers! What the hell is going on here?
Yes, you can go through the story, play in multiplayer, go through the classic towers. BUT! the Game also pretends that the time towers are the main entertainment!
Conclusion: the game can be purchased at a discount, as I did. It will tighten You up if you are ready for an endless grind, problems with the network connection. I forgot to say that MK 11 requires a CONSTANT connection, and I sometimes hung up(Again, I played less than 2 hours, and this greatly spoiled the impression). You may be drawn out by the story, but you are unlikely to like other activities: Krypt was in 9 and 10, classic towers are in 9 and 10 parts, time towers were in Injustice 2, I2 has even more options for customization. To be honest, MK11 is an I2, only with fatality and brutality. Fans of the series, as I understand it, do not like customization and microtransactions. I can't disagree with them, given how many things there are for each character, and how much opening these things takes time and currency.
If we talk in numbers, then 6/10 for the plot and mechanics, which are already worked out in part 10. But that 11, that 10 part of-both not devoid of shortcomings. And as they say: ""Evil is evil, Stregobor. Smaller, larger, average ‚Äî all the same, the proportions are conditional, and the boundaries are blurred. I am not a Holy hermit, I have done more than one good thing in my life. But if I have to choose between one evil and another, I prefer not to choose at all.""

Microtransactions like in free-to-play mobile game. Wait this game isn't free..right. There's a system with modifiers in a Towers of Time and Microtransactions (consumable items to let's say - become immune to the rocket which can dmg you and for example interrupt your abilities, even Fatal Blow).

Crashes in Customization menu and Towers of Time.

The thing people calling SJW. Lads and Gents. We have gallons of blood, severed torsos, cut off head, skinned dismembered bodies, but all the ladies in this game looks anti-sexy. Some of them looks like muslim womans (nothing personal). Where's the logic in that ? On top of that we have some kind of sexism, 'cause a lot of men have uncovered torso.

Honestly, we don't have super hot oufits in MK X. But I had no thoughts like those I have now after I saw Skarlet and Jade and the other characters. It's just stupid. It's not about wank, it's about the things we'd used to.

And one of the weakest parts of my beloved franchise - is music. I perfectly remember music from the two old movies. It was great. I don't remember almost any music from the games. Christ, Mr. Boon, look at Tekken 7, Yakuza 0, MGR: Revengeance.

Update: thinking about why I hate this game: when developers have a decent game, then add artificial boundaries to hinder your enjoyment, then offer you to pay to pass those limits that shouldn't even be there in the first place... I will be very cautious when purchasing anything from Netherrealm studios in the future.



Updated August 20th. Gameplay hasnt held up, and it was the best part of this game. The new characters are too late and not enough. For me to ever recommend this they need to completely revamp the progression system: how they ever thought doing the same 2 animations dozens of times, or the screen just totatly blacks out(even when you do fatalities) or controls reverse as an added gameplay challenge that is fun is BEYOND ME, HOW STUPID. I can go on and on about how shit the progression system is

WHAT A TOTAL WASTE.

suggestion: revamp progression system, allow couch or internet friends to work on it with you, so you can play the game together and earn all these things you have locked away behind this crazy grind. Also make it way way less grindy...

original reviews:

DO NOT SUPPORT THIS. This is Mortal Kombat mixed with KANDY KRUSH! the progression IS TERRIBLE. I wish i could get a refund. I will not be pre ordering another mortal kombat game EVER.  Towers of time is awful and the only way to get the loot boxes with the possibility of something nice. BARELY any fatalities, all behind paywall or grindwall.

ONE EXAMPLE OF HOW SH!TTY THIS GRIND IS: there is a time tower you can create for in game currency where you only play one hero to get specific hero rewards. Ive reached a level that in order to unlock i have to preform SEVENTY FIVE FATALITIES with this one character. so, im stuck playing ONLY ONE CHARACTER FOR 75 MATCHES... AFTER THAT! the next lever requires SEVENTY FIVE BRUTALITIES. NOW.... does that mean all the fatalities ive performed over the days count and i should be somewhere in the 20-30 range, only needing 90-100 more games, ONLY WITH ONE FUHCKING CHARACTER? NOPE! it starts counting the second you PAY to active the tower....

~ Conclusion ~

The latest Mortal Kombat wasn't a masterpiece but it was kinda cool tho.
My problem is The Sahu kahn, In new timeline or NetherRealm's remaster, They just tryin' to show him as a big dumb useless king who just want to kill everyone and everything with no purpose!
He used to be in original series a smart and powerful king who always had a trick on his sleeves!
I hope NetherRealm in next game show us that powerful king again!",1593127369,1593127504,True,167,18,0.786173880100250244,14,True,False,False,76561198405177339,119,32,1054,0,1054,1591303056,,

Currencies are not too grindy to earn and the story of the game is pretty good. Aftermath DLC wraps up the story of this game nicely as well. I really enjoy the customization options put in this game whether it be the skins, augments, or special move sets. Towers of time feel fun and refreshing, with very few modifiers that feel cheap, (I'm looking at you totem of dark), and the percentile estimates for where you are going to place are fairly accurate. 

The only complaint I really have about the game is that the aftermath DLC was charged at a higher rate for people who already owned the game which doesn't really make sense, but I'm not sure if that was a decision by netherealm or (more likely) a decision by Warner Bros. 

Krypt is badass with throwback references from previous MK games and some very interesting secrets to find. Makes earning currencies worth it. 

(Also I had to fix my controller inputs by going into the script and disabling some weird controller it was defaulting to so my xbox one controller would properly work, no bugs after that though)

And yeah occasionally you get matched with someone completely out of your league on paper, but take the challenge...you might be surprised. And if you lose that one its all good just practice more.  Story is pretty fine its probably the best fighting game stories out there and the new story DLC is honestly a bit better done than the main campaign. The voice acting is fine and as not great as Ronda Rousey is as Sonya Blade it did not bother me too much.

However the grind wall and micro-transactions for costumes ruined a would-be game of the year contender.

MK11 has so much potential and brilliance. The excessive greed was unnecessary, they already sold countless copies of the game. Paying for additional DLC characters is tolerable, but grinding endless grinding just to unlock the desired costumes and weapons ROBBED the fun-factor from this game.

Months later, and we still cannot access or equip the desired costumes and weapons for our favourite characters. What a waste!

Guessing it wasn't the developers decisions, but overlords?

I stopped playing this game within weeks, then occasionally return, only to experience further dismay...primarily due to not being able to use the weapons, perks, and costumes that I want for my favourite characters.

76,71231134,english,"Apart from the fighting game ""power rangers: bftg"" this is one of the best fighting games to teach yourself or someone new to fighting games to play.  The tutorial is in-depth and detailed teaching new players the basics then offering additional tutorials where the button layout and combo timing is able to be displayed on the screen for you and exemplified by the ai for you to observe and then duplicate for yourself.  As gameplay goes the flow of play is slower than most fighter games so that you can pick up on what is happening on screen easier.  Combo attacks are not as long as many other fighting games so that you are provided with more opportunities in a match to learn from your mistakes when engaging an opponent.  the button timing for imputing moves is also very forgiving compared to frame perfect requirements for games like killer instinct and street fighter.  The graphics look great and there is enough content in the game to keep you busy if you are motivated to earn extra costumes for your favorite characters through arcade-gauntlet challenges, playing online with decent connection speeds, play a 3-4 hour story mode in the base game and also play locally with friends.  Some of the cons for the game would be that the 2nd local player does not keep any settings or unlocks from the main account profile so a second separate profile is needed to earn many of the classic character costumes for the other player.  Also veteran fighting game players that enjoy the long and fast combos may be disappointed in the formula change making the game slower paced compared to past iterations.

88,71180555,english,"After more than 200+ hours into the game, it's time to write a little review.  Mk11 is by far my all time favourite Mortal Kombat of all time. What's so diffrent to X and 9? Well 9 made a good start back in 2011 to reroll the franchise and delivered a great story, which consequently continues in X and 11. Also Netherrealm Studios tried to make the game more competitive with breaker possibilities and X ray moves. They refined that system in MKX by speeding up the pace making the game focus more on an offensive approach. Frame Data for each fighter was visible, which took the game to the next level and made it even more professional.  Than there came MK11 which had the Tower of Time, a great story, the krypt, local play, online play, multiplayer etc. Well everything MKX had before so where is the difference? Mk11 focuses more on the basics of a fighting game. They made the game slower again and honed the fundamental basics of a fighting game. X Ray moves are now called Fatal Blows and are only available once the players health is on 30%. Instead of a breaker one can now use break aways in mid air, or roll out of a situation or even use a getup attack. To pull it off, Netherrealm Studios redesigned the HUD from scratch. Every fighter has now 2 defend bars and 2 attack bars, which will refill over time.  For a break away in mid air 2 defense bars will be used. Which means that a roll out of a dangerous situation is not possible anymore, after a break away. So be careful to use your bars wisely. That however opens up a lot possibilities for diffrent strategies. Mk11 has so far imho the best fighting tutorial I have ever seen in a fighting game. Next best thing is the Killer Instinct tutorial, which is equally good. Everything is explained from simple movement to complex frame data, to block advantage you name it. The concept which started in MKX to customize your fighters giving them 3 different fighting styles is now perfected. Not only can you choose between 3 diffrent styles, you can also create your own fighting style, and outfit. Lots of outfits, weapons, helmets are waiting for you to be unlocked in the krypt or the towers of time. One can spend lots of hours in the game and if you are not in the mood to fight yourself, than let the AI fight for you. Yes there is an AI, which you can adjust however you see fit. For every Mortal Kombat fan this game is a must have, but even for beginners I can highly recommend the game. 
MK11 is my favourite and was my start in competitive Mortal Kombat gaming. I'm really looking forward where Mortal Kombat is going from here. üòÅ",1592838990,1592842929,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197995881528,164,5,15477,0,13446,1597326879,,

I really enjoy that you get to customize your character's move sets in online matches, as much as i wish they were all just available moves at all times bound to different controls and such but nerfed in damage and stun time since they're always available, the moves that are available for choosing are REALLLYYYYYYYYYY FUN! Like, for real, some of the most fun fighting game attacks I've ever seen! And they're just always available! Think about how much content this game has btw, every character has SEVERAL special moves that you can swap in and out, with tons of unlockables and singleplayer modes, PLUSSSSS it has SO MANY AWESOME CHARACTERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! So many incredible guest stars with iconic attacks kickin' it with Mortal Kombat Klassics like Skorpo and Frosty Sub, alongside BRAND NEW FIGHTERS TO THE FRANCHISE!!!! Beautiful!

Okay, Imma be honest. I never do this. Imma make a paragraph about graphics. Imma do it. This game is flashy as FRICK. I think this game chose to be more of a good casual game because of how many forced animations there are and how the comeback mechanic of this game is LITERALLY just an animation that does way too much damage for a reward for landing one hit. I'm so glad that all of my friends, along with myself, choose not to use this ability in 1v1s. I wonder if tournaments ban it, it kind of like... ruins the tension of getting down to super low health and coming back and winning cus' of skill and stuffs. oh well, anyway; The animations are big, visually pleasing, and plentiful. Maybe too plentifiul. God, there's so many freaking animations oh my gosh. They're pretty, yes, but oh my GOD. I wanna get back to the GAME BRO. (sorry im impatient in fighting games, i get too excited to just stop playing mid match every couple of seconds, it KILLS FLOW SO BAD).

It's basically just leaves a bad taste in your mouth until you see liu-kang near the end.  But than it just gets more pagan more occult and more french socialist inspired.  Instead of going the obvious direction of yin and yang.  You get this weird socialist ending with Jade and Liukang re-writing the whole universe. 

In addition the game play and animation feels terrible and chunky especially raiden.  All the women characters seem OP in comparison to the male counterparts and In  AI battles  Shao Khan dies continuously to female characters.  While only Liu Kang dominates for the male characters.

The game is also riddled with bugs in addition to the bugs.  no SLI support.    Everything feels disconnected and looks like B actors trying to make a play based on Mortal Kombat 2.  

After 81 hours of gameplay it's a terribel game that's completely lacking in all balance as a fighting game fan it just becomes a chore to play in every aspect.

58,50344814,english,"If this is your first ever fighting game...  all power to you buddy... enjoy your MK11, you can stop reading further :)

BUT, if you are coming from Japanese-made fighting games like Street Fighter, Tekken, KOF etc, its difficult to sit through and try to look past the animations of MK11 where the characters have no key-poses or hit-stops. What's key-poses and hit-stops? ok, try to visualize how Ryu throws Hadoken or does Shoryuken, or Chun Li's spinning bird kick... you can clearly see how they pose in your mind right? Now try to visualize how Sub-Zero throws his ice blast projectile or how Sonya Blade throws her projectile... cant properly visualize how they actually pose? lets go a bit further. Try to visualize how M. Bison does his crouching Hard Kick... you know.. the slanting slide thingy.. now try to visualize how Scorpion does his crouching kicks... which one can you visualize more in your mind. THAT's the difference between good and bad animation my friend. 
It's 2019 and MK11 still uses sluggish animations and Dial-a-Combo mechanics.

This dial-a-combo or 'type-writer combo' yea i call em type-writer combo because you simply input random sequences of letters, mostly in pairs of three: XXY, YYA, XYB, BBA, etc. as if you are typing random letters/words on a type-writer and these inputs will initiate a series of 'combo animations'. In Street Fighter terms... everything is 'target combos' !!! No 'manual combos' whatsoever! Its so absurd that in many cases, if you input three buttons, say XXY, more often than not, said character may do a 4 hit combo! ... why not 3 hits since we input XXY!? i dont know. Yea, it was cute way back in the MK3 days but in 2019?... still? i dont know. If this combo mechanic was so good, i wonder why virtually any other fighting games outside of Midway/Netherealm has never incorporated it in their games... hmm. The closest MK-ish mechanic game is Killer Instinct and that game has absolutely perfect animation with proper key-poses and hit-stops. 
Also, worth noting: the competitive scene of MK11 is limited to America... and at a stretch, till Europe maybe. Makes you wonder why no other part of the world plays MK competitively.

Casuals will buy for the single player content, the guest DLCs and the shock factor... which by this time, is a little played out now.
The funniest things is, the most enticing part of MK, which sells MK, happens after the end of actually playing a match... the Fatalities, Brutalities and Friendships etc... This actually says so much about the game. When people talk about Street Fighter, they will talk about the actual gameplay...the strong ground game, the fundamentals, pokes, whiff punishes, option selects, plinks, lights into mediums into heavies, the special cancel, the one frame links, FADC, Crush Counters, V-Triggers etc. When we talk about Guilty Gear, we talk about the gatling system, the roman cancels, air dashes, air combos etc. Instant Kills do not really overshadow the combo system. When its Tekken, we talk about the importance of mastering movements, the korean backdashes, the 10 hit juggles, wall bounces etc. Again, Rage Arts here are at the backseat. And then we have MK where all we talk about are the gruesome finishing moves, the shocking x-rays, the stage interactions and character to character interactions etc. and not so much about the combo mechanics. 

Don't get me wrong here, MK is one of my favorite franchises growing up and it hurts to see that the developers knowingly do not try to improve the franchise of anything outside of what SELLS: Long a** story mode, guest characters, shock factor, 1000 different ways of character customization, but all underwhelming. These customization are essentially just trinkets: shiny little pieces of armor with little or no value. There are no 'x factor' in these customization. It's just helping the characters lose their identity. All these are gimmicks at its finest. I'm not saying gimmicks are absent in other games... but the other games are not carried by gimmicks alone... they are carried by the in-game mechanics. Street Fighter 4 was at the top of fighting games for 8 years (2008-2016), without guest characters, without a giant story, forget even a story mode, no story mode whatsoever, just an arcade run thru... and without any character customization.

At this point, MK11 feels like a large single player game with sub-par fighting game mechanics. And since MK is supposed to be a competitive fighting game first and a single player game second, it is difficult to invest for the long run. I may move on after i finish story mode, character tutorials and krypt. Well, back to Japanese made fighting games i guess.

Post Script: 
Ultimately, after a lot of retrospection and introspection, i feel i am ultimately to blame and not the game, necessarily, because nostalgia goggles is such a dangerous thing. I remember that i was most into MK when i was in my teens to late teens, when i was in my high and higher secondary school days, those 'angry teen' days when i used to think that a game having fatalities and brutalities was way cooler than the bland Ryu with his hadoken and his tattered karate Gi. Looking at the present, MK's target audience and marketing strategies hasn't changed at all. Its just that i realize i have grown over MK now, mechanically speaking. You might think, why the hell do you buy this game then? Well, let me put a little bit of blame to fighting game streamers and youtubers especially Max Dood... and Vesper Arcade to some extent :) In one of Max's beta game reviews, he stressed so much how MK11 has changed compared to previous titles and how the game borrows so much Street Fighter mechanics. Vesper too had stated that this may actually be the perfect MK game for SF players to delve into. I happen to interpret those comments as MK going to have SF style combos and mechanics. Thinking this would change everything, i jumped into the hype-wagon and pre-ordered the game, only for my hopes to be shattered. In all fairness, Max's and Vesper's reviews were not all wrong. The meta-game has definitely changed, its much more slower paced and ground game-based now, but the input execution still sucks and the whole game overall still depends too much on the shock factor. So unless the next MK is gonna be a game changer, in terms of animation and mechanics, i may not delve into MK anymore... i may play MK11 from time to time when my younger cousins or friends come over and want to play, but other than that, i will not personally invest in the current MK game anymore. Thanks for reading this long post. Appreciate it.

MK11 is designed with fun above all else, and it succeeds!  Lots of modes, tons to unlock, really fun Kombat system.  Like any good fighting game, the more you learn, the more fun it is!

If you haven't been buying it for the reason of initially people saying the grind of getting all items is too much, don't worry about it.  You don't need to earn every item.  It isn't going to give you much of an advantage over other people.  Its mostly cosmetic.  From what I can tell, there are no gear pieces that are overpowered, so you are fine.  If you haven't bought it because you feel there is some SJW thing going on with the females, get over yourself.  What a non argument.  No, they don't have basketball sized breasts anymore, or shaped like Jessica Rabbit.  But they are still hot looking!  Maybe besides older Sonya, but younger Sonya looks freaking hot.  Its just an artistic choice, and I appreciate that they look more realistic.  

If you buy a fighting game, expect there to be future DLC that might cost $30 to $40 in the future.  Its how they keep it updated an more relevant.  You don't need all the characters to play against others that do own them.  I play Tekken 7 and Soul Calibur 6 from time to time, and I don't own the latest season passes.

97,70725517,english,"Got this on Switch (base) at launch, and on Steam (+expansion) at Aftermath launch. It's good. I still don't quite understand x-ray sequences, but at this point game would look weird without them. What's good about them is how they changed from previous games' ""accumulate and execute"" into a bit of ""resource managment"" when you can use xray once per fight and only when you're below 30% health, so it's either a come-back tool or mind-games moment when the fight is tight and both players can execute them at match point.

Story - well, nobody really plays MK for story - is fun. There are no QTEs now, and thanks for that, and sometimes game offers you chapters with two characters, in which you select character before every fight. It adds a bit to replayability, but for everyone who plays this once, it's an option to play a character you like more at best and a dismissable gimmick at worst.

Design-wise, it's gorgeous, we're once again reminded, what can UE4 do in skilled hands. There's something about character faces that I don't like, especially Cassie and Scarlet, something's off, but I can't really explain it and it stops being noticeable after while. ""Cosmetics"" are ok, but they aren't just cosmetic, they can have some special perks that affect something about character. I didn't invest enough time into that aspect of game, so I can't really tell how impactful it is, doesn't seem to be fair, but I don't know that.

What I disliked about it was it's size. On Switch it forced me to download 20 GB day-one patch on top of cartridge, and on PC it weights about 100 GB. Why? Well, of course, high-res textures (which is good) and pre-rendered cutscenes (which is why?). Its campaign (base+aftermath) is a 6-7 hour long movie, which plays while game is loading the next fight stage and combatants. So i guess it pays off in the end, but still having one game that takes this much space is not something I like. Also imagine downloading it with less than 100mbps internet...

So I praised Krypt in MKXL. Yeah, it felt like lootbox dungeon, but it was fun to explore. A-a-and it sucks now, because of course it would. First off, it's performance is horrible, I thought it was too much for Switch to handle, but apparently it's too much for RTX2080 too: out of the box it's capped to 30 fps, and when I unlocked it in PC-Settings, fps floated around 40-60. But performance aside, now it feels quite predatory because it uses 3 currencies (koins, souls and hearts), it's loot pool is diluted with materials for crafting and buffing equipable gear, and some of it progression is expensive: I found a place which required 2000 souls to go through, while I had about 400, and a ""chest"" costs 100.

Constant dips in frame rate, graphics look worse on pc for some reason, patches are a week or more late (except for paid ones of course because money money money), I desync every other game.... Not only the port is bad though, oh no. The game has inherent flaws in the game design. Character variations were the highlight of MKX, they were a selling point. Of course they return better than ever in mk11, lol got ya, the variations in this game are a fucking joke. They are so lackluster. Some of them are useless. Raiden's variation 3 is a meme. The variation system is such a joke, I refer to them as v1, v2, v3 were as in mkx I remember them by name because they were that much more of an impact. Don't worry though, because you can make your own variation in this game. However, you can't use them in ranked and the choices are so limited I question why the option is even there. Well that all sucks, but what about offline modes? LOL this is the worst offline experience to date. Towers of Time is a frustrating grind were you have two options:
1) Play MK with infuriatingly difficult modifiers
2) Spam consumable items
The Krypt at first looked epic, and to some extent it is. Its essentially a mini free roam area with loot and puzzles. You can craft items and kill monsters and stuff, its interesting. HOWEVER, a big part of the community of any mk game since Deadly Alliance (2002!) maps out the krypt for players who want to spend currency on just the things they want. This gives players a choice, do I go online and get exactly what I want or have fun with a surprise because I'll get everything in the krypt anyway? Welcome to mk11 where you don't get a choice! Its all random lootboxes, but you can't pay for them with real money so cool I guess?
Also, this game has waaaay too many currencies. There are 4 currencies and of course Time Crystals are the premium paid currency to buy things that are available from the krypt for a limited time to avoid the god forsaken grind that the CREATORS MADE INTENTIONALLY!!!
The story mode is ok except the ending basically makes any cool moments not even matter.

DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!

  A...I did not liked subzero ice axes design - old hammer was better. Also all ice weapons design is bad - is like Chinese jeans market you can find anything except ordinary black jeans all will be colorful tasteless bells and whistles with holes - as all fantasy weapon design is. Its ok to experiment but I like minimalist practical design to be an option. Also I like Subzero as you can see. 

  And what I don't like is that fluidity is absent - one move really badly transition to the next - so I can't slide and do uppercut in one fluid movement sequence.  [b]Sliding on ice while playing Subzero of course.[/b]  Animations are abrupt for my taste - All these stop-frames etc. are pro concepts may be based on 12 animation rules importance and years of fighting games legacy. Can be so. From personal experience - I'm not a pro - It does not add to a pattern recognition... eeeh  - at all I guess? Why then that quality level is there?

  Some weird stuff going on with pick up weapons as spears etc. why on earth you will throw away weapon, that you just pick up, after only one blow? But that's a minor thing - just style complaints - I don't expect this game be a fighting hardcore simulator. 

 All that predator, robocop, alien, joker crossover thing... right now I'm kinda closed-minded in terms of universe consistency so I don't find this appealing.

75,70418774,english,"There is perhaps a no-better-time than now to buy and learn NetherRealm‚Äôs, ‚ÄúMortal Kombat 11,‚Äù with the release of its new, ‚ÄúAftermath,‚Äù DLC. After having played Mortal Kombat 11with all of its modes, I can safely say that this is NetherRealm‚Äôs finest creation yet. Combat is the most important part of any good 2d fighting game, and while being known for its over-the-top blood and gore, 11 brings refined gameplay to solidify its place among some of the best fighting games of all time. The roster is huge, especially with all of the DLC characters, and there‚Äôs enough fan service combined with series staples for just about anyone. Each character has enough unique moves to keep any expert studying for hours, yet doesn‚Äôt forget to leave room and accessibility for more casual audiences. I found combat more slowed and tactical than most other fighting games, rewarding strategic thinking rather than button-mashing. Loads of different mechanics are shoved into gameplay while being just the right amount so as to not be cumbersome. Defense and attack meters are now split to be more of a tool than something to just throw at your opponent. Combos are greatly rewarded and are luckily a little easier to execute as with all of the new mechanics, there are more opportune windows for them. Fatalities are as gory and brutal as ever and are still endlessly satisfying to pull off. Fatal blows are another new addition that can be used when a player is at low health, making the ends of matches all-the-more intense. The different mechanics are accentuated by the vastly diverse move sets of each character and the way they play. For example, my favorite character to play as, Erron Black, has great zoning moves to punish characters like Liu Kang and Jade that like to move around and expend their meters, getting in their opponent‚Äôs face. Mortal Kombat 11‚Äôs modes are enough to keep anyone, casual or not, hooked for hours. A robust story mode was the main attraction for me, as it‚Äôs essentially a long movie where one gets to play as different characters playing key roles in one overarching plot. The plot itself is convoluted, self-aware, and well-acted. It is serviceable as a videogame story and sets up gloriously interesting situations with time travel. The other two modes don‚Äôt hit quite as hard, being more gimmicky than anything. ‚ÄúKlassic Towers,‚Äù is a gauntlet with crazy modifiers which seemed a bit out-of-place when it boiled down to how it handled keeping things fresh. Towers of time, while sometimes hitting the mark, are ever-changing romps through different sets of scenarios that also couldn‚Äôt help but feel gimmicky. The extras and customizables are handled uniquely with, ‚ÄúThe Krypt,‚Äù an explorable hub akin to games like, ‚ÄúWarframe,‚Äù or, ‚ÄúMonster Hunter World.‚Äù I appreciate the way it's all laid out, and it‚Äôs a fun distraction, providing a way for the player to marvel at their cosmetic achievements. Customizables themselves, however, are randomized loot boxes obtained with in-game currency which doesn‚Äôt feel good at all, even if there are literally thousands of ways to customize a single character. The game‚Äôs net code is sublime and I never witnessed a single bit of lag in any of my online matches. The matchmaking is fine, and I always felt like I had a fighting chance in each match. The game‚Äôs soundtrack suits the themes of battle but is nothing to bang one‚Äôs head over and isn‚Äôt all that prevalent. The graphics, on the other hand, are absolutely stunning, with blood looking realistically fluid and all of the bright, vibrant colors within the characters and settings accentuate this while running as smooth as butter on my system. Facial animations and voice acting don‚Äôt always synergies well but this is easy to overlook. Aside from a few lackluster single-player modes and lacking in some innovative ways to handle unlocks, Mortal Kombat 11 has enough to keep any player coming back for just one more game. With its well-grounded gameplay, and it‚Äôs over-the-top style, Mortal Kombat 11 is among the best fighting games of all time, and the best traditional, 2d fighting game I‚Äôve ever played. 9/10",1591497362,1591497397,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,76561198377795255,387,23,1312,0,1311,1591497842,,

77,70418266,english,"I'm having a good time. Unlike MKX the online actually isn't half bad, and more importantly people actually are playing. If you're not planning on being a chicken and not actually going online though, I don't see much of a point in buying this just to play against the NPCs. Find a character you like, pull up a youtube video on how to play them and start playing online. You're going to lose alot but it's the only way to get better. 

Also, I remember there was alot of controversy about the ""grind"". For single players, if you stick with the towers of time having your AI fighter do all the heavy lifting + augments you can get PAID. Also when you play online you also get PAID. I have not had any issues with the grind, not to mention the stuff in the krypt is all optional stuff, outfits, different items to wear, augments, that sort of thing. Everything you need to go online and play against people is already at your finger tips. Also, I've been collecting the time crystal currency (the one that you can buy with real money) and I'm actually at a loss of when I'm supposed to spend it. To say the game isn't pressuring me to spend cash to get more time crystals is an understatement. 

In short, if you're like me and wanted to buy this game a year ago but all of the controversies around it stopped you, don't worry about it and buy the game. The game doesn't feel like MKX but once you get into the groove you're going to have a great time. And like I said before, the biggest difference for me with MKX and MK11 is that the online capabilities this time around are actually good and you have plenty of other people to play with.

83,70403738,english,"I seriously wish I could give it a Thumbs Up and a Thumbs Down or better yet a star rating based on Categories, Oh well here it goes,
Politics - Yeah the once proud franchise of ultraviolence is now morally bankrupt that violence is ok but female skin is bad, as they say it isn't realistic for bikini girl costumes, but yet you still have Stilettos on the females, because that is practical, but the true double standard is where most guys are in loin cloths, so right off the bat no one is looking for morality in MK series, if the developers or publishers think otherwise, I have bridges to sell, and a pier you can jump off while you lose all your bad boy cred.
Graphics -  Are great 9/10 for some bad facial animations, but they are getting miles better from what they were.
Sound - 10/10 good soundtrack and SFX sound great.
Features - Its amazing seeing all the RGB lights on my PC actually react to what is going on nicely done guys 10/10.
               - Guest characters 10/10(WTF is Ashe of Army of Darkness, give it up already)
Story - and this is where the game flushes itself down the toilet, literally well atleast any continuity they had going like MK9 hitting the proverbial reset button by going down the uninteresting plot device known as time manipulation. Characters have zero motivational sense and zero awareness other than their own douche qualities that make them ignore common sense or reality- I give it a - meh/10, its a fighting game and out of that context a 5/10.

Challenge/Catharsis - and this is where the stain hits the carpet after hitting the fan, A fighting game rating should be based on the amount of fun I have kicking someone's balls out their mouth, instead the once enjoyable crypt is not fun anymore due to crap design and grindfest mechanics for little to no reward or RNGing the rewards instead of just making it clear or at least in some grouping as to what you are buying. The towers of time/Towers is a slog just to lock 1/10000 variations on color of a specific outfit or equipable item which is a rabbithole of stupidity and because people wouldn't want a challenge they introduce consumables to make the game easier and in terms just flat out worse for no reason. Kronika is just a terrible boss curve in terms of difficulty the game always had this problem cheese it and its easy, try to actually fight and lose because she will cheese you as all the bosses have done since MK1, seriously I can't believe they found a way to ruin it, X rays get repetitive and finishers have become a joke with a easy currency. - 4/10 

If you are looking for some fun the game is fine, but unless you are prepared to waste your life grinding needless crap, yoiu are never fully getting what you paid for, this isn't Dark Souls beating your head against the wall either needs to be enjoyable or rewarding and the new version of the crypt is just a slap in the face going back to multiple currencies only this time they don't segregate what you will earn in those chests so RNG most of the time gives you crap.",1591471338,1591471338,True,0,0,0.471014469861984253,0,True,False,False,76561198008228817,801,6,1045,0,1045,1591396815,,

Then the aftermath. Well say goodbye to premium edition because it doesn't exist anymore on the store page because that would be misleading wouldn't it? You'd probably think to yourself ""I'm getting everything right? it's the PREMIUM edition, right??""
Nah let's put all that content you wanted from the beginning behind YET ANOTHER PAYWALL
There'll also be the annoyance of one character release per 2-3 months that are so overhyped or stupid (looking at you robocop what the hell are you doing here)
Friendships? Paywall
New characters? Paywall
Stage Fatalities? Paywall
Anything fun? Paywall
I'm sick and tired of hearing the term ""Free update"" Because you know they weren't free before oh wait yes they were because I own this product that I paid my money for. What happened to buying a game for a set price and that was it? No more added costs??
Do I really own the game becomes the question or am I just renting it at this point? With so many added fees Do I ever have a ""complete"" game anymore? What else are you going to add after aftermath? Get rid of that then turn it into the super duper special mega ultra winner edition for an extra 59.99???

How much is enough? How much do you need to bleed from the average consumer? Remember when 79.99 was a lot to ask for a game? I wonder how much Mortal Kombat 11 will end up costing you once you have absolutely everything.

Final verdict 2/10.
The only reason it deserves any kind of score is because of the gameplay. Like I said, fantastic game HORRIBLE BUSINESS PRACTICES. DO NOT SUPPORT NETHERREALM STUDIOS (AND ALL THE OTHER STUDIOS LIKE THEM) UNTIL THEY GET THE MESSAGE THAT THIS IS NOT OKAY




EDIT - IMPORTANT! AFTER READING MORE INTO THE FAQ, THE NEW STAGES, STAGE FATALITIES AND FRIENDSHIPS WILL BE INCLUDED FOR FREE. HOWEVER COMPLETELY REMOVING PREMIUM EDITION FROM THE STEAM STOREFRONT AND NOT TELLING ANYONE ABOUT IT OR GIVING PREMIUM OWNERS ANYTHING BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE GETTING EVERYTHING UNDER THE GUISE OF ""PREMIUM EDITION"" IS ABSOLUTELY ATROCIOUS BUSINESS BEHAVIOUR.
STOP USING STREET FIGHTER DLC PRACTICES THAT GAME COSTS ABOUT 500 DOLLARS IF YOU WANT EVERYTHING
PLEASE MORTAL KOMBAT RISE ABOVE THIS GREED AND SHOW YOUR FANS YOU CARE! IF NOT FOR THE FANS THEN AT LEAST SHOW YOUR COMPETITORS YOU ARE BETTER THAN THEY ARE. PLEASE.


EDIT 2 - MAY 26TH RELEASE OF AFTERMATH. STILL NO UPDATES ON WHAT PREMIUM OWNERS CAN EXPECT
Possibly the worst thing about this (for me) is when you look at a new player vs someone who prepurchased or bought premium for roughly 100 like myself. A new player can look at this game and say either I'll take the vanilla edition for 69.99 or the full edition for 79.99...hmm I think I'll get the 79.99 one who wouldn't?
Then look at the unfortunate people who decided to support this game early on with premium edition and got scammed out of the masquerade skins, payed roughly 100 dollars already some even 120 at no discount, then feel slapped in the face when guess what your edition is now the vanilla one with a bit of dlc it's no longer premium and come pay 49.99 for the complete edition.

The playerbase online can be a mixed bag. You'll meet some honorable players and good sports a lot of the time, especially in Kasual matches. However, in ranked, and Kombat League, you'll find some more sweaty and tryhard players that just ruin the fun of the game.

False, not only is this shell of a game looking to take more from fans, it's not willing to admit or fix it's shortcomings.

Edited:

I still cannot recommend it but some things have changed:

1) The blurry graphic bug is no more and the game looks way better know. Also Nvidia shaders are compatible with the game so you can add more detail if you want.
2) The FPS lock was fixed by some random modder. unbelievable that a fan can accomplished more  than this Game studio.
4) Grind still bad, but the rate that you gain currency has been improved.

Edited Aftermath:

The only thing that keeps me from adding a positive review right now is the overprice DLC. I cannot endorse that.

1) Let's be honest here. The DLC is definitely overprice for the content. It's good but overpriced, maybe i can justify that rpice if 2 more characters (for example sector or cyrax) were included.
2) At last the developers added the option for 60fps. I wish injustice 2 had the same option.

The story telling and merge into battle afterwords is so buttery, it almost melts in your mouth. Then you realize wait, why tf do i not have popcorn. It's just like the movies except better and without the popcorn. Unless you want grease all over your controller or keyboard. And that's fine too!

I can go on and on about how satisfied i am.

-The pricing. 90$ premium edition doesn't include all the DLC, despite stating it would? This probably is an actual crime, and if the BBB cared to investigate it, it probably would find evidence of deceptive advertising.
-The support. Apparently on PC in particular, the servers are often down, and netherrealm and WB aren't great at fixing their issues. I've heard that they prefer the console editions anyway, and from anecdotal evidence I can confirm that those are often working and they're fixed much quicker.

TLDR:
- Piss poor game balance
- Randomass patching with no meaningful changes to some characters while others' problems don't get fixed and yet again other characters just get away with absolute broken frustrating stupid nonsense that makes no sense and should be removed from the game.
- Enjoyable with your friend and if you play Top Tier
- Cashgrab Kombat Ultimate Edition: Your Wallet Here

REVIEW:

You know how in Tekken, Soul Calibur etc they are actually TRYING to create some semblance of Game Balance. 

Well not in this game. There are characters that are literally NOT ALLOWED to take a proper meaningful nerf, and characters that are NOT ALLOWED TO BE GOOD.
You can literally just tell which characters they love at Netherrealm Studios and which ones they hate, if you look at their frame data and how well their moves function.

There are characters who just simply whiff (miss their hits) at the weirdest situations or just lose because this other, obviously munchkin character's same move has a better hitbox. 

You can pick top tier basically and then the game can be fun.

Graphics 10/10 - It's made by a huge studio, what do you expect. OFC it's good.
Story 3/10 - There is a story mode but if you haven't bought Aftermath yet, do not. Just watch it on YouTube and see if you like it. I think it's trash.
Gameplay 5/10 - When the game actually works it can be enjoyable, that's why I bother writing this because I wish they did meaningful changes.

NOT RECOMMENDED.",1556316256,1590834564,False,1,2,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,76561198053709574,107,36,37826,76,21262,1601635379,,
38,70033554,english,"Okay so this game is extremely fun. Great fighting game and simpler then the mortal kombat X. I enjoyed the story and the way it went into fights. The story just makes no sense. When future fights the past self, they are suppose to both feel the pain etc. However sometimes they do and other times they don't, it just doesn't make any sense at all. I mean it's still fun as hell but the story is just extremely inconsistent with this whole past and future self thing. Sometimes past self gets hurt then future self gets hurt other times you beat the crap outta future self as past self or vice versa and past self standing there 100 percent fine lol. The writers need to be fired I know 10 year olds who could see the dilemma with this story lmao. You'll see what I mean when you play through the story. Also button timing is a pain in the butt for larger combos. You have to be exactly precise or you'll just stand there looking stupid. Also I don't like the business practices they are doing such as DLC characters etc. However I got the game on sale with the dlc so it wasn't a big deal. As far as competitive online, Good luck these guys are try hard as it gets and it is impossible to win a fight unless you spent days in training mastering long combos on your character and can hit them precisely every time.",1590828740,1590831690,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,76561198083978849,265,46,907,0,515,1594428495,,

What has WB done to you Netherrealm survivors of Midway? 


So much potential squandered character, skin, and story wise. 

I can‚Äôt recommend it now since you now have pay double to get a full story single piecemeal along with the typical half the cast.

Also tries to trick you into buying Frost when she can be unlocked in game.   

Too much gimmicky unlocking microtransaction pieces, needless grinding, a majority not worth it and making the crypt Randomly generated and worthless, as well bloating up the game.

Been playing since Mortal Kombat I on arcades, and I with this entry  feel very disappointed. 

Pros:
Still Mortal Kombat
Slick controls and good PC port.
Fine graphics and aesthetic 
Awesome character interactions.
Still rocking fantastic soundtrack, voice acting, and audio. 


Neutral
Gone is a majority of the camp as story and character now try to take themselves more serious than ever before.

Basically there is a feeling of wasted potential when time travel is involved when you think of the whole host of MK history and characters.

Special move enhancement/defense bar now moved from ‚Äúx-ray‚Äù which is now a two hit button at low HP. I personally find this change sliding more into the territories of other fighting games and not very MK esque. Even less skill consideration in this area required.

Lackluster stages compared to previous entries with very few stage fatalities. 


Negative:
Worthless bucket of micro transactions.
Worthless randomly generated Krypt
You are now playing for a now very incomplete game. 
Extreme DLC with publisher playing dishonest games with customers and that DLC

The amount of time you can spend in the game is phenomenal as well. MK11 is one of the best games in the series.

The level of customization of your characters is great, and you don't have to worry about the stats of your gear either. It's all purely cosmetic and it allows you to create your own special look for the Mortal Kombat characters. The Krypt is amazing in this game, but it has it's faults in some areas. There's so much to the Krypt that it may feel overwhelming and the chests can drain you of your Koins real quick. Overall, MK11 is a solid 9.5/10.

Game is optimized and works fine (Single Player / Offline modes) and enjoyable.
But the multiplayer is a total mess
Poor netcode
Too much lag
Takes long to find a game due players number on PC
High ping always I have like 150ms min while I have no lag in SFV online
Final Verdict :  I don't recommend this game at the mean time, except it gets netcode fix and cross-platform with consoles, otherwise it's a dead game on PC
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1st June
The game ran through lot of updates especially the latest one ""3.2GB"", it was improved a lot 
Everything runs fine on 60 FPS
The only con left : that the game won't last much on PC (Multiplayer will die eventually after few months)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3rd May 2019
Well despite the issues at launch, I would recommend this game 
Pros : 
+Outstanding Story Mode
+60 FPS stable whether online or offline and even Story Mode on max settings, AA : On
+Smooth gameplay and lot better than MKX
+Lag free online games I haven't meet any desync issue but some players did (it depends)
Cons 
-30 FPS Krypt and Menu/Cutscenes/Fatal and Krushing Blows 
-Lot of transactions in Krypt and grind isn't that helpful
-Unfortunately it's not crossplatform with Xone and PS4 so the game will die eventually on PC after few months

19,69890550,english,"I would give Mortal Kombat 11 a good 7.5 out of 10 for the PC. It is a worthwhile investment for a hardcore MK fan and something that would interest newcomers.

What I liked about MK11 was:
1. Simplified the input strings for special moves and introduced separate attack and defense meters.
2. Unprecedented training mode with basic to advanced and character specific concepts - will help for any fighting game.
3. Fascinating guest character roster including the Terminator and Spawn.
4. Game programming and settings are user friendly and it is supportive of all levels of technical setups.
    - When I first played it last year I used a six year old laptop which the game itself said doesn't meet its minimum specs.
    - However the game let me edit frame skipping and dynamic resolution to still make it run very well on medium settings.
    - I now play the game on a top of the line PC that can run it on maximum graphics settings and it runs well.
5. The netcode is brilliant and on both the outdated and top of the line PC's online gaming was as fast as offline gaming.
6. The ability to create custom variations of characters is good. The grind issue luckily doesn't affect your access to moves.
7. This game worked well from the launch and did not require multiple patches and fixes like Mortal Kombat X did.

What I don't like about MK11:
1. This game has a grind and loot component linked to the towers of time and krypt mode which put off fans:
    - They did put in patches to fix it however many towers are still unnecessarily long with rewards still a bit low. 
    - Also the system where you may need to use power-ups and modifiers that you win randomly is annoying and non-MK.
    - Most of the custom accessories, skins and brutalities for characters require hours of unlocking in towers and krypt.
       (Luckily though you have access to all of the characters moves up front otherwise fans would have been really put off).
    - Unlike previous MK's this game seems to be designed to force you to spend time on it which can bore you off.
    - Despite its visual splendour and unprecedented technical excellence its not as addictive as MK9 and MKX.
2. The game makers have excessively commercialised certain aspects which also put off fans:
   - Costs of additional content are nearly too pricey for their worth.
   - The games tendency to commoditise everything and try to also sell items you can earn in-game is a put off.
3. The game is easy to pick up and I play the Hard Level. But beyond a point it is designed more for professional gamers.

On the whole a decent buy and the story mode in both the 2019 game and the expansion pack are the best the game has seen ever.

I was right to wait before buying aftermath as I knew they'd mess something up with this new update. man am I glad I kept my money cause i'd be super angry right now

3/18/2020: I deleted the game, the new spawn update ruined it, it's now locked to 30fps and even has fps drops during fights plus there are some new graphical glitches, you can't tag moves, game crashes while playing in the lin kuei assembly, and it now takes forever to retrieve game data. Like always WB and NetherRealms studios introducing a new problem/s to the PC version with every update they put out, you dudes got the worst PC department of any existing company.

this is always the same issue with any game/product from Netherrealm Studios/Warner Bros on PC, horrible support, bug after bug only made worse by every update they put out, stupid decisions to cap framerates and sabotage PC features. After this one i'm gonna start skipping anything they release since I have no use for a console... Thank you netherrealms and WB from always scamming PC gamers.

Updated 8/21/20019: Cpu usage bug still present at times still not fully fixed.

UPDATED 10/8/2019: another new bug introduced with the new terminator update, now game doesn't launch. seriously NRS/WB you need to fire your PC department... solution verify files... game disconnects from server too frequently now and you have to close and re-open the game for it to log back in. some intros have various audios and video desyncs. 

Leaving the technical aspects aside, mk 11 gets boring after a while as the only thing that gives this game replay value is just endless farming for skins (most of the same but different colors) that are 100% randomized so you can play for hours to save up for something specific and end up getting anything else besides that most of the time. I.E. 

Things I hope don't come back for the next installment of mortal kombat (when it comes out)

- no more farming (it's a fight game not a MMO or a RPG)
- better and longer combos
- the ability to run again
- NO MORE RANDOMIZED KRYPT ITEMS, if gonna going to have to farm for something then I want to get the exact loot i'm farming for not random sh*t.
- the game to have a more mortal kombat type aesthetic and not an injustice super hero type look, we all hated mk vs dc KEEP THOSE TWO FRANCHISES AWAY FROM EACH OTHER FOREVER. (what a waste of a character slot on the joker, should've added something better...)
- NEVER EVER EVER AGAIN BRING BACK THE TOWERS OF TIME, add some other modes to game like conquest, chess kombat like in the mk ps2/xbox era or something like that.
-  Bring back tag team play.
- DID I MENTION NO MORE FARMING OF RANDOM SH*T?

In conclusion, the mechanics aren't bad, the idea was a good one and if they change somethings they could make it better but sadly MKX is still the better game.

Pirate the game if you want to see the story, and don't give this company any money. You will see as with many others I had the premium edition, and lo and behold here is another money grab. Since this game launched the paywall is just grotesque. I am a fan boy so I got this, and played through the story then walked away after seeing all of the cash grab. I get informed today that there is a new expansion which I thought paying for a premium edition would fetch at least the continued story line. Nope. Cool. Unlike a MMO or Open World type game were those types of expansions DRASTICALLY expand the game this is just another cash grab.  

I also wasn't really a fan of the game post story as well. Like one of the best parts of MK is Couch Co Op, and having the game be able to pick up and play. Sure you can do that, but even Original Characters have to be custom made, and you guessed it behind a paywall. Like okay EVERY title before this the character is them, now I have to create base characters with their signature moves. Right...

84,69840874,english,"From the roster of fighters to the gameplay updates to the EXCELLENT single player story campaign, MK11 is probably the best work of the Netherrealm Studios era. One aspect that I was looking forward to the most was the the ability to upgrade character gear and skins that was first featured in Injustice 2. While that was a robust and engaging first attempt, this time it seems more well-rounded and rewarding (especially since the early game-patches tempered down the initially ridiculous tower grinding you had to go through to earn anything of value). 

The best section of the game lies in its' story mode. If you played MK9, MKX or either of the Injustice games, you'll be plenty familiar with the pllaythrough style presented here. Start the story as one character, fight a handful of opponents as the story progresses and then you're tied to a new character for the following chapter. While the storytelling structure is more or less unchanged, the story itself is the most fun and engaging of any Mortal Kombat game to date. 
The often lazily implemented ""time travel"" aspect is actually used to great and logical effect which also opens us up to some classic characters being included along with a seamless integration of new personalities that fit MK like a glove. Where MK9's story was kind of a soft-reboot and MKX's story was a bit muddled and overlong, MK11's remains original (for MK at least) and despite a healthy runtime, doesn't overstay its welcome. It constantly ramps up the tension, stakes and drama leading to an epic and rather satisfying conclusion that actually feels like a closing chapter to a story. 

The Krypt is as expansive as ever, despite a seemingly randomly generated rewards system for opening any item in it. Trekking through its' locations can be a lot of fun but can quickly become draining if you're searching to unlock 1 or 2 specific items within. 

Most noticeable upon first playing will be the tweaks and alterations made to the combat system. Unlike most iterations of MK, this one really emphasizes honing your skills with any particular fighter to excel. Gone are the days where you could stand a decent chance on any difficulty by frantically button mashing the game pad. This system is much more deliberate and somewhat slower paced because of it, but feels much more rewarding once you start to string those ever important long combos together. 

As far as aesthetics and presentation are concerned, MK11 stands head and shoulders above any fighting game of its' generation. The character models/animations, the stages, the in-fight ""camera"" work and obviously the cutscenes exhibit the devs really topping their previous best effort in Injustice 2. While  every character also has a pair of new outfits showcased upon first booting up the game, most of the classic MK1 and MK2 characters do have their classic outfits waiting to be unlocked or in some cases downloaded later. 
 
Lastly, its also worth mentioning that even a year after release, the slow but steady supply of DLC has been as strong as ever, despite the heavy additional price tag for all the content available. Definitely make sure you are sufficiently enjoying the core game first as it is just different enough from MKX to perhaps turn off some fans if it doesn't suit their play style.

Not perfect, but packed with plenty of content with or without the hefty DLC offerings. MK11 strikes the best balance yet of new and classic features of the current generation's offerings. Some may be put off by the more methodical gameplay, but I found it to add a lot of replay value since it also helps to differentiate the styles of each of the game's fighters. Take your time and bring a lunch if you are the type that absolutely must 100% complete and unlock everything it has packed inside.

+ The Story & the Krypt are great game modes to help beginners learn about the characters' lore and moves, but also a nice touch for the fans to enjoy & earn rewards. 

+ Easy to learn & hard to master! There are number of easy and complex moves and combos for all characters. If a special move is too difficult for you to perform then you can actually choose to improve an easier one instead by changing the character abilities & augments for your favorite variation.

+ There are many skins, gear & augments to unlock! Just whole lot of them for everyone! I spend many hours just to customize the looks & special moves of my favorite characters. I hope there will be even more character skins from the previous games especially from Mortal Kombat 9.

+ Guest characters are just awesome; honestly, I've never seen any other game that offers so many of them! I hope they keep adding more guest characters both as new characters and as costumes for the existing playable characters.

+ There are so many different game modes in this game I still haven't find time to play all of them; but, I'll update my review about the rest as soon as possible.

MK11 looks great but doesn't catch the spirit of the original game IMO.

You will finish Story Mode the first evening to enjoy all those cutscenes and the story which you could check on Youtube or anywhere else. I'm pretty sure you will never play that mode again. Krypt is dead. Towers and other PvE stuff suck. They are too easy or too hard, rarely exact that difficult to have fun. And you will get power-ups there mostly.. to use them in other towers and again. So.. finish towers to finish more towers. Yeah.. cool. At least they added AI to help.
The only real fun this game offers to you is Kombat League. And it sucks. Not because I hate to lose etc. Its score system seems a huge fail to me. You can't decline a battle with a low rank player and if you lose your point rate drops dramatically (sometimes around 100 points). And if you win a low rank you get 10 point. And those low rank players are not necessarily play bad. They joined KL lately. In the end of a season it's so painful to reach even 1500 rank for me, because the game give me bunch of 0-500 or 500-1000 ranked players which I sometimes lose and lose a way too much points. I wish they add 'Decline' button for a low rank players. It's not my fault they join KL in the end of a season! Sometimes KL is fun but as a casual player I don't even want to compete in KL at all but they put a lot of nice exclusive skins there, which is a pain to miss. And there's no alterate way to get them. I have thousands of hearts and souls which I have no place to spend. Buying league skins and equip for them will be a great alternative for a casual player like me to get them. KL is stil pretty laggy place but I can see they're trying to improve that.
Lack of new content is also a problem. No new skins for existing characters except Kombat pack ones or league reward. We had to wait months for a new character. The game was released in April 2019 and we got all 6 KP characters a year after. I don't think I want to buy a second Kombat pack.
Some characters look bad, lot of weird costumes. Most equip and skins are copy paste recolor. Quantity over quality.
Now it's time for the Aftermath update. Should I say that it really sucks that you can buy the game+Kombat pack+Aftermath cheaper than I paid for Deluxe edition (the game+Kombat pack) a year ago. And for Aftermath I must pay about half of the price I originally paid for the whole game. Just for 3 new characters plus 3 skin packs. Not worthy!
My advice for casual players is to wait year or two more and buy the full game with a big discount.",1570982247,1590185398,False,12,3,0.535895705223083496,0,True,False,False,76561198111400554,7,1,48955,10,38320,1601983547,,

I bought the Premium edition under the guise that all future add-on content would be a given. Was extremely saddened to learn that even with the premium edition I did not own all the DLC. For premium owners you'll find out that the masquerade skins are behind a paywall. Not something I want to pay 8 dollars for. Also not something you can grind for.
Then the aftermath. Well say goodbye to premium edition because it doesn't exist anymore on the store page because that would be misleading wouldn't it? You'd probably think to yourself ""I'm getting everything right? it's the PREMIUM edition, right??""
Nah let's put all that content you wanted from the beginning behind YET ANOTHER PAYWALL
There'll also be the annoyance of one character release per 2-3 months that are so overhyped or stupid (looking at you robocop what the hell are you doing here)
Friendships? Paywall
New characters? Paywall
Stage Fatalities? Paywall
Anything fun? Paywall
I'm sick and tired of hearing the term ""Free update"" Because you know they weren't free before oh wait yes they were because I own this product that I paid my money for. What happened to buying a game for a set price and that was it? No more added costs??
Do I really own the game becomes the question or am I just renting it at this point? With so many added fees Do I ever have a ""complete"" game anymore? What else are you going to add after aftermath? Get rid of that then turn it into the super duper special mega ultra winner edition for an extra 59.99???

How much is enough? How much do you need to bleed from the average consumer? Remember when 79.99 was a lot to ask for a game? I wonder how much Mortal Kombat 11 will end up costing you once you have absolutely everything.

Final verdict 2/10.
The only reason it deserves any kind of score is because of the gameplay. Like I said, fantastic game HORRIBLE BUSINESS PRACTICES. DO NOT SUPPORT NETHERREALM STUDIOS (AND ALL THE OTHER STUDIOS LIKE THEM) UNTIL THEY GET THE MESSAGE THAT THIS IS NOT OKAY

While we haven't gotten klassic kharacters like Rain, Mileena, Smoke, and all the other characters (plus Cyrax and Sektor, who appear in story mode but are not playable), I have a suspicion that we'll get to see all -- yes, *all* of those characters in the short years to come. 

From the atmosphere of the game that screams ""I know how cheesy and over-the-top I am and I don't give a sh*t"" to the morbidly creative gore and fatalities to the upcoming stage fatalities & friendships, this game really has it all. Gameplay wise, combat is slower than Mortal Kombat X, but I don't think of it as a design flaw -- more as a design philosophy that detaches itself from its predecessor. Maybe MKX's quick-paced gameplay is the exact type of fighting game you're looking for, maybe it's not. MK11 is still a huge fun to play and delve into, especially when you know and love the lore. 

Customization is the selling point of this game and I *love* it. Not all the gear are unique or awesome, but it's so satisfying to see in-game cinematics and finishers with the character I chose and dressed up. Graphics are out of this world and even with my not-so-high-end PC, this game runs pretty darn well.

Oddly enough, the story (which is praised by many fans) is not at all outstanding to me. It's not bad by any means, but I often have trouble with stories that revolve around too many characters. The only MK reboot story that I really loved was Mortal Kombat 9's, and that was basically a combination of the stories of MK 1~3. I'm really excited for Aftermath, however, as it's a sign of Netherrealm Studios moving away from its comfort zone. 

The only real serious problem I have with this game is the fact that one of its Steam achievements doesn't seem to be working. I checked on the Internet and yep, I Want It All is a really infamous achievement for its bugginess. Unless someone fixes it, I guess 100% is a no-go for me.

With so much juicy content and a plethora of fun characters to play with, MK11 is probably my favorite Mortal Kombat game yet. Gameplay refined to the hilt meets gorgeous graphics and cool customization elements? Exactly the game for me.

Kombatants I want to see in MK11 in the future (including those that probably won't show up):

The DLC is boring and repetetive, there are too many game mechanics and espically the customization is just too much and boring. The skins are mostly the same and only recolours. And now they are selling this game, plus KB and Aftermath? I am sorry, but they should be selling KB, Aftermath and the game for 20, each. I am not buying any WB/Netherrealm games Day 1. Why should i when i can get all the Dlc in a special version for the same price as the game day 1? And don't get me started about this whole political correctness.  THOSE should not be in any game...

I wish we could get back previous guest fighters such as Alien, Predator, etc. (I understand licensing is an issue).  As a longtime MK fan, this game is great.  I hate pumping money into a game with skins and other perks within the game but I understand that the additional content that money brings is worth it.

I think the only negative for me is the adding of attributes into the game and other perks to give you leverage on tower challenges.  To each their own on this, just not for me.  Regardless. The game is fantastic.

I actually really like the Krypt in this one too. Getting able to explore Shang Tsung's island is pretty amazing. It also seems like they took queues in design from the movie. Speaking of, modeling and casting Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa as the official Shang Tsung for this new iteration was probably (for an 80s baby like me) the BEST thing they could've done to reel me back in. 

I wish they could've done something where they pulled back in all the DLC characters from X to still be usable in XI but I get why they might not be able to... licensing and all or whatever... 

All in all I'd say to me the game is an 8.5/10 

Points off for the final boss, honestly. I enjoyed the fight but making an enemy you actually have to BS cheatsydoodle attack to beat because they are immune to like... 90% of special attacks and punish you severely. I feel a final boss fight should challenge you to the maximum draw of all your learned skills... not turn you into Liu Kang, master of ""Catch these repeated high and low kick combos""...

The problem with all of that is every 10-20 minutes, I've faced a ""You have lost connection to the Server"" error, and it stops everything you're doing and kicks you back to the main menu. Whatever progress you've made in Arcade, lost. Any rewards you were gunning for, lost. And until you connect to the servers again, you can't even get back to half the gametypes, including the Krypt (the main source of unlocking anything), until you do. 

There is no ""Reconnect"" option; you must close out of the game and relaunch to establish a connection. Now your 10-20 minute random counter starts again; rinse and repeat.

the challenge tower section ""towers of time"" is totally broken and the skull rating means nothing. 
examples of what ""challenges"" this game considers fair. 

-make the screen dark, nearly pitch black for the entire fight...if you don't have HDR you won't know what the hell is happening. you can see some shapes moving but you can't even tell which one is your character without moving it. let alone attacks, blocks ect. 

-electric homing rockets, if you block them they do 15% of your life in chip damage and if you don't they do 20% and give you a ""shocked"" status that basically ruins the fight because for the next 15 seconds you will randomly get shocked causing minor damage and opening up your guard for far too long. a lot of times I was hit because the rocket came in at the end of a combo or while I was being juggled so I couldn't even have a shot at dodging. 

-have green orbital laser that does damage for about 5 seconds that sucks you in even if you dodge it sometimes and on top of that there will be random land mines spawning on the ground that pop you up repeatedly. This wasn't even the fun kind of challenging as basically nothing I did could stop me from getting blasted all over the place. extra fun it was a dragon challenge so I couldn't see the landmines because the challenge message covers the bottom of the screen...because why test anything...
 
I'll be fair and say that they do give you items to use in the towers to combat some of these situations, but it's basically impossible to know how difficult even ball park a fight is going to be. The only things that measure difficulty are completely unreliable. 

The adjustable difficulty of the AI is a laughable. Often times you will have an AI that barely attacks at all the entire game until it gets down to the fatal blow then it suddenly turns into a defense god. I've lost games I was winning by 80% before just because all of the sudden the AI turned into a beast and wouldn't allow me to finish their last 10% life. breaking grabs, stopping fatal blows or blocking them. repeated perfect blocks. taunt counters. AI programming is inconsistent, so it feels like a troll.",1589398143,1589428003,False,3,0,0.496987968683242798,0,True,False,False,76561198021950917,320,44,1079,0,732,1589703766,,

Pros
Gameplay - the movement is a lot slower than the previous ones at first it felt weird but once you get used to it feels a lot better than the old ones. Fatal blows have also been reworked and are now only available when your below 30%  health and only used once this might sound bad at first but it makes the game so much more competetive and fun.
Graphics - game looks amazing 
Characters - probably one of the best roster since mk9 and even more amazing characters coming in  DLC
Story - great story that both new players and old will love
Customization - the best customization of any mortal kombat game, every character got 3 different items to customize a bunch of costumes swap abilities and their intros and outros.

Cons
DLC - even tho they are great the DLC is way to expensive

15,50344810,english,"Gameplay:

The game play is as good as always, even considering the issues with the PC gaming (the button controls don't always do what I ask...).  I suspect the reason for this is that, even with the settings to steady the frames, sometimes the computer skips a frame--with unfortunate consequences; even a single fps change seems sufficient (my benchmark was good, with about 1 or 2 fps difference at most). Perhaps further optimization is in order for the PC players? The actual settings for the controls though, are an absolute god-send; they're far easier to change, and the change applies to the whole game; in MKX, I had two parallel controls--for some bizarre reason, the changes I made for the fighting didn't apply to the crypt. Imagine yours truly truing to repel a spider with keys in all the wrong places; luckily, this does not appear to be an issue atm.

The AI is challenging, but some days I feel like they're pulling the same crap MK 2 used to, with the AI somehow always able to figure out what I'm doing. the challenge is definitely a step in a right direction--at least for me--but one wonders hows the average player will handle this. The customized looks are a nice addition; I can give my scorpion and Sub-Zero's some very nice clothes and moves.

Kronika is a war crime. What asshole character can just spam an unblockable move that sucks away a massive portion of your health, while essentially winding you forward(?) or backward(?)? At least one can see why there's a warning about potential seizure for epileptics...Yes, I can beat kronika--that isn't the issue. I just think this is cheap and gimmicky. The other attacks are cool, though. Since the intiial writing, she's clearly better-balanced, though that move still sucks.

Also, I set the rounds to last 90 seconds. Why on Earth is it showing 200+ seconds? And I'm not referring to Kronika's stage--I mean all the rounds. 


Story:

It's OK, but there are some questionable moments. For starters, there's a scene on a galley that shows a character who shouldn't be there. He needs to be replaced. As I can't give spoilers, I can't tell you here who it is, but I invite people to look at it as of the 26th of this month. The story kind of doesn't make as much sense as it appears to at first; I'd say more, but cannot, as this would spoil the game's story.

But wait, there's more! If you want all of the characters, you'll have to shell out $50 USD for the Kombat Pack and Aftermath DLC combo, plus an additional $6 USD for Shao Kahn alone. That brings your total for the full game to $116 USD. Even after you pay that though, you'll find many of the cosmetic features locked behind an in-game currency system. Worse still, these unlocks are mostly random. After about 20 hours of play time, my main fighter has about 11 pieces of gear, while a fighter I have never played as has over 20 pieces of gear through these random unlocks.

*GAME IS GREAT BUT WBs CHARGING IS SHITTY*
MK11 is easily the best fighting game of all time this is a must buy if you are a long time MK fan and if you are new to this franchise,trust me you will love this game.
Pros:
1.Gameplay feels very fresh it is indeed different from other mk games,but it doesn't feel like a totally new game.
2.Story is very good easily the best Mk story i have ever played.
3.The kustom variation system is very good and is one of the best new additions to the game
4.Pretty well optimised.
Cons:
1.The towers of time is sometimes annoying to play because the AI has unfair advantage.The game forces you to use consumables.(the difficulty is kinda nerfed now)
2.Krypt although good has many flaws.Most of the chest only contains consumables and they rarely have skins or gear

UPDATE(AFTER ALL DLCS)
The DLC characters are pretty damn good.Get all of the DLCs
Game is still fun but mostly when playing with friends or random online players.

61,68934355,english,"This is a half-decent movie that runs for a couple of hours. The visuals are okay, there are some interesting shots here and there, the plot... well... it's best not to think too much about it, as it is a standard hollywood fodder, with some melodrama, some moralistic moments, some commonly accepted ""correct"" messages in it, and if you try to analyze the story too much, it will far to pieces quickly, because it is fairly senseless. The visuals are nice, though, and looking at some areas depicted in the movie you wonder whethere there's an interesting lore about it, or if it could be all made into some sort of computer game like Zeno Clash, or something conan-like with RPG elements in it. I mean, given by amount of money and effort they put in backdrops, it would be a shame if they didn't make some sort of RPG and bunch of artbooks out of it.

...

Oh, right. Occasionally over course of movie you have to play a fighitng minigame, but it all doesn't really matter much, as the difficulty of those fight isn't that high. 

------

Well, alright, let's talk a bit more seriously now.

This is definitely a movie made on unreal engine first, with fighting game and monetization attempts bolted on top of it.

Monetization attempts are extremely shady and are borderline scams. For example, there's Shao Kahn in the game, it is in the files, it is available as your opponent, with full moveset, BUT. If you want to play him, you have to pay up. Another character is unlocked over course of story automatically, but once again, the game encourages you to buy that character in the  store. Said DLC has mostly negative ratings now. Now, there are certain robots in the game familiar to you from Mortal Kombat 3, they, once again, appear as opponents, BUT, you can't play them and you can't buy them either. Bunch of other characters make appearance in cutscenes, but cannot be played in any way, and cannot be bought.

All things considered, it looks like the plan is to milk player with dlcs, one dlc per character, regardless of whether the character was part of the story or not.

And all of that stinks. 

Honestly, I don't understand why the heck developers wasted so much money on the movie (feels like half of the budget if not most of it went there), instead of making  more characters available. And I honestly miss the times o (Ultimate) Mortal Kombat 3, where the character didn't waste so much time in cutscenes, and there were no melodramatic nonsense with everyone being each other's father/wife/sister/whatever. Pummeling things to death with fatality at the end was it. With a short story fragment at the beginning and another one at the end. I wouldn't mind that hee.

Another disappointing thing is that they decided not to bring in any of the old outfits, like the ones used in MK3 for female characters. Apparently now this is too risky for people to behold, and they can't die that without dying from heart attack. 
Although now same female characters are wearing high heels, while in UMK3 they were standing flat on the ground, and half-naked dudes with blue paint on them are somehow still okay. But oh well.

Either way.
Business practices in the game are shady as heck, they're obviously setting a cash cow with character dlcs there, some of the characters they sell are already in the game, and so on and so on.

But. If you ignore all of it and buy this with 60 to 70% off, then you'll get an action movie that despite weak plot is watchable, and has decent VFX work in it, as long as you don't think about the plot too much.

And because the movie wasn't horrible, I recommend it.

If you are a new comer, fear not. Mortal Kombat 11 has perhaps the best tutorial yet seen in a fighting game. As well as being a quality fighter, Mortal Kombat 11 is generous. Perhaps overly so. The game features a ‚ÄúKrypt‚Äù area where you can exchange in-game currency for random rewards, such as new moves and costumes for characters. 
When it was first introduced a staggering 27 years ago, Mortal Kombat always had that reputation of being ‚ÄúThat fighting game where you rip people‚Äôs heads off.‚Äù Known more for its gore and violence than its gameplay. Things have changed since then with MK9 and MKX bringing the quality of gameplay up to meet the quality of violence. That upward trend continues with Mortal Kombat 11, which is not only the best Mortal Kombat has ever been, it‚Äôs also arguably Netherrealm‚Äôs best game yet. This is one of the most fully featured fighting games you can buy, with both single- and multiplayer modes that will last both casual and hardcore audiences a long, long time.

The gear customization adds a relatively better level of diversity, but don't expect too much, as again most items are only slightly different than one another.
Other than that, and the fact that some of my favorite characters are still missing in MK11, the game is really good overall. The combat system feels more fluid and painless than its predecessors, specially for less skilled players like myself, even though the game still expects you to perform frame perfect button presses for some combos and actions.

[b] FATALITY! [/b]

Mortal Kombat 11 is a game developed by NetherRealm Studios, QLOC and Shiver and published by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment

The game offers some pleasant graphics and really vibrant colours, although some ugly glitches here and there, it is pleasant all the same

The game does suffer with some repetitiveness at certain areas of the game but a fun game nontheless

Mortal Kombat 11 overall, however, is a fun game to play in short bursts and a good gory bloody fighting game to play!

4,68821417,english,"So I was an idiot and dropped a Benjamin on the Switch version of this game. As bad as that version is, it's a testament to the quality of this game that I still put in over 175 hours into it. With the release of Aftermath, I didn't have any problem with paying $60 for the superior PC version. What really sells me on this game is the amount of stuff one can do on top of a well-tuned fighting system. It's scaled back from the MKX days, which had wild combo potential. This game's philosophy is more geared towards neutral and footsie play. But that's not to say that a good player can't perform spectacular 50%+ damage combos. 

There's plenty to unlock and characters to learn, so this is a great fighter to sink a lot of time into. The story is really dumb, but in a very good way. I also really dig the rotating Towers of Time. The Krypt is also a solid experience for unlocking a ton of skins, gear, and other odds & ends. The Krypt was a mess at launch, but it's been balanced and made more fair since then. The game also features one of the better tutorial systems of its FG counterparts. So if you're a true beginner, this game not only has a great fundamental fighting game system that can translate skills well between straight forward fighters like the Street Fighter series, but it also gives you proper juggle and combo training for those goofy anime fighters.

Anyway, the thing I would count against this game is that it lacks a cross-platform multiplayer feature. It's kind of unfortunate, but luckily this is usually among the top 3 played fighting games on steam. With Kombat League going on, there's a good flow of players that come and go online. The other downside is that patches take longer to reach the PC version, which is a bummer. But if you can handle that kind of hangup, then it's not much of a blemish on what's an already incredible game. 

Anyways, this game is one of my personal favorites. I doubt there's much that'll severely disappoint the average player. If you're an ELITE GAMER type, then I guess you'll find just about anything to nitpick to death.

First things first. I did preorder this game last year and started playing day 1.
With all the matters in the release, as many can recall, the game had a tons of issues in gameplay and performance.
Now, more than 1 year after released , the game is fluid and playable in all its forms and modes, incluying Dx12.

A good amount of fighters to select, luckily they are all unlock at start, except for one.
The gameplay itself evolved; it's not as fast as MKX but it's more passing now, need to make new strategies in kombat.
Fatal blow: good ""replacement"" of the X-Ray (well, they are still on the game as Crushing blows).
Love the new Krypt, it reminds me the old Konquest mode more than 15 years ago.
The ability to customize fighters isn't new, but this one you need pretty much a lot of time to collect the skins and items (grinding).
The story is one of the high points here, well rounded and it's continues the story from MKX and so on (coming Aftermath),

Last but no least: finishers (Fatality and Brutality)
The key of every MK game. Without it, it's just another fighting.
Especially in Fatalities, I love the way they make them look like you are going to take a picture and hang it over your bedroom or living room. Nice touch!

---------------------------------------------------

Pros: 

- Its really nice
- Combos and Fatalitys are amazing
- I don't really miss the X-Rays because the Fatal Blows are good as well
- Very good graphics.
- The ability to make your own custom variant on every character.
- The story is good, long enough to entertain you for a day or so if you don't play like a maniac
- Some little improvements could be done but overall good.
- I feel like there are less charaters than in MK X (did not count them) but the gameplay is way better,
- The game design and user interface are also good. One of the best ones i've seen yet
- If you link your Razer peripherics to the game, it's gonna put an exquisite light show. You'll have to see to really belive me, it's incredible.
- The long wait between games payed off (in my point of view)
 _________________________________________

Cons:

- The currency in this game is absolute horrible.
- It's not very good optimized (I have an i7 8700K and GTX 1660 Ti so it shouldn't lag)
- If you connect a PS 4 controller to the PC, the in game buttons show Xbox buttons and it's hard to associate every button on my PS 4 controller to a button on an Xbox controller so i don't mess up combos and stuff,  I got over it pretty quickly.
- Worst. Microtransactions. Ever.        Could have been done better.
- And one of the most important cons of them all : TOXIC COMMUNITY. People are so toxic in online matches and they are going to sweat their balls of to make sure you loose and then teabag you.

Hope my review helped people, I wasn't very sure either if im going to buy it from the looks of the reviews but trust me, it's worth it. I absolutely recommend this game.

Dialogue is somehow still corny and badly voiced and the story in general was pretty bad. The difficulties have the most horrendous balancing I have ever seen. I would recommend playing on hard if you want to be brutally tortured for the duration of two minutes, in which you need to sweat profusely and learn every single combo like a pathetic loser that will juggle you on the side of the map for the entire match. On the other hand, The medium difficulty was reminiscent of versing a 5 year old toddler that does not know how to block and attack. On medium difficulty you will never use the fatal blow ability and simply use the most east to execute combos in order to win. There's a difference between making a game challenging to play and making a game unfair to the point of needing to change the difficulty setting.

The only thing that saves this game are the updated graphics and the fact that playing with a friend who is not a complete sweat is still fun.

- Terrible retcons (especially for Kabal and Sindel)
- More patches for gameplay balance than a homemade quilt (did anyone test this game????)
- Sloppy storytelling that is more like a rehash of MKX's story, and the ending implies that everything we just saw might be undone anyway? Like, why?
- Same characters getting all the attention again while others get pushed aside or ignored (Enough with Cassie Cage, all right? She's not that interesting of a character.)
- Treats the MK lore like garbage for a quick cash grab. Tries to be 'daring' and 'original' by making some lazy character changes (i.e. the terrible retcons)
- LOTS of wasted potential (Why not rescue the revenants? Why not have a Noob Saibot redemption arc? Where is Ermac, and how awesome would it be to see his current self vs. his past self? Why not bring back Shang Tsung and have him side with Raiden again Shao Kahn?)
- Some really lazy intro dialogues (and they admitted to rushing these)

I've been a fan for a long time, and it's disappointing to see MK turned into a cash grab with no substance, no respect to the lore, and no respect for the fans. I won't be dropping $60+ ever again on another MK title if NRS continues down this path of mediocrity. They CAN do better, than HAVE done better.

20,68068829,english,"My noob view: MK11 is pretty entertaining and each gamer can find it enjoyable no matter which style of playing he/she prefers or which lvl of gamer he/she really is. 

Tutorials - nice and easy, so everybody can get it very fast and just enjoy the killing, no need to do all of them.

Killing blows - also very nice experience during fight. Slow mo which emphasizes the punch or kick you have just given to enemy. It  rewards you with bloody detail of smashed ribs, destroyed jaw and other funny moments of pure pain.

I simply love  fatal blows, because they add to game more dynamic, almost cinematic experience during fight. You can use just one per match and only if you have small amount of your life, but on the other hand, there are many special moves and interesting combos, thus you would not have time, nor desire to use just fatal blows anyway. (talking mostly about single-player mode, I know that online multiplayer would probably appreciate it.).

Story mode - quite interesting and enjoable as well. What is more, you receive some rewards after each chapters - e.g. Frost character.  You can complete the story in a few hours, so not very time-consuming. 

Fatalities  - just cherry on the top of bloody sundae. You can find this final movements in Krypt as reward in the chests, however you can unlock them too just by simple using of correct inputs during your fight. 

Brutalities - oh yeah -  elegantly stunning. (My favourite is Kabal and how he can get rid of enemy¬¥s skin in brutal piruet:D)

Mercy - do not not why, but sometimes I have problem to apply it, although button combination is pretty simple. (maybe noob i am)  Mercy is great because you can give/is given to you a chance to change the fight result - little bit risky, but  entertaining feature and you receive some extra hearts for Krypt rewards.
 
Krypt - oh yeah, famous grinding affairs. Well, it¬¥s true that random content of chests in Krypt, no matter how expensive is,  makes me sometimes angry, especially if you have to farm hundred years to receive sufficient amount of koins but you receive almost nothing for it. e.g. you expect some cool skins and you receive stupid picture to gallery. 
On the other hand, even if I played it only  for 30 hours maybe, I have already 3 or 4 skin for each character + other cosmetics etc, so it is not bad for the beginning. (Each character can have approx 50-60 skins). I am not even sure, if I really need them all. I would say, it is enough in single player mode, however I understand that in multiplayer online mode, you would appreciate more cosmetics combination to distinguish your character from others, especially if each second gamer  plays for Scorpion as i realised:D. 

However regarding to special chests paid with hearts - I must admit, that is time consuming. You receive maybe two hearts for some brutal end of match, maybe three for Mercy and maybe more in some time tower challenge, but each heart chest costs from 100 to 250 hearts and of course, it can include nothing useful for you. That is little bit unfair kind of lootbox in comparison to time you have to spend in game to receive appropriate number of hearts/koins. And we know that it is not easy to always make brutal/fatal/mercy end. AIthough AI may help a lot. 

Towers - great feature of this game, especially neverending one is my favourite and i am constantly trying to get far. Some fights includes special challenges regarding to moves and combos, so you will never get bored. 

Time Towers - hate them. It s unbelievably unfair and flustrating no matter which level I choose, no matter which fighter I choose or which konsumables i would like to use. I cannot simply find the way to survive and win:D.  Of course, that it¬¥s partly caused due to the fact I am lvl noob, but strictly speaking, it is big challenge for me. I am screaming lot of invectives and have almost broken all fingers during playing... with the same sad result unfortunately:D  

AI fight - nice feature, help you if you need break, some hearts, some coins, if  you are tired,  or if you just want to see how the fight may look beside noob lvl:D. 

To sum up, well, maybe some features seems to me little unfair to gamers, on the other hand, you can enjoy so many hours with this game so I must recommend it..  
Pros: Less or more enjoyable towers, relaxing single fights, interesting story mode, option to play with CPU or other player or AI, online fights, Krypt exploring is original way of looting, and gaining of achievements is simply fun.... 
 

Cons:
I do not understand why krypt mode is only online and not in offline mode??? That is FAIL indeed.  And if it must be online, I would appreciate to appear on the place I was last time, not on the beginning of the Krypt each time! Really, what is the purpose of online Krypt mode, if it does not remember your position?

Sometimes -  MK server decides that I am not probably worth to play this game in full potential and from time to time it just disconnects me for no reason :D - I am desperate if I am on the top of some tower and this happen! It should remember, at least in Tower mode.

*So yes, I manage to find a way to keep my internet stable, but only at midnight: No sleep tonight. On top of that there's this virus outbreak and everyone stay at home put the internet on strain, 

Pro: 
-Very good graphic, altogether the combats, powers and bloods are impressively well visual it never get bore.
-The Characters physic look amazing all of them move so realistic for example: Liu Kang shaolin stance how he keep his feets moving is amazing.
- Each of every character get to customize their appearances none of them look a same at all, you could go purple if you lucky enough to get it at the Tower of time or maybe accomplish some task like the Story, Character tutorial, or opening some certain box in the Krypt (will get to that later).
- Gory Brutality and Fatality: holy molly you would not believe how freaky detail it was.
- *If you have a good internet service* you to fight and challenge yourself various type of difficulty at the Tower of Time, there this thing call ""modification"" make the fight very interesting for example: fire will spewing out on the ground, rocket come out of nowhere, or calling for other fighter assist, and all this even yourself could use it if you have the items.
- 25 plus characters for you to take your time and learning them one by one. This is the great for you who stay at home while waiting for the plague to pass. It's so interesting you won't get bore on this game mainly because each and everyone of them had their own moves, but most importantly their own ability for you to customize as well.

Con:
- MK11 server; very slows, frustrating, and something if will kick you at the Start screen.
- Convoluted grind, but thankfully all this cut in half all properly adjusted to almost fairer amount of grinds.
- Easy Fatality Token and Skip fight Token. Smh seriously wtf did the dev or the publisher were thinking this is, a Mobile phone game? Get that outta here and don't even try to put in the next installment. 
-Krypt: also to the land of ""Loot boxes""; Seriously why is this even doing in the fighting, is so unnecessary and yes almost all of them are random. You must use the in-game ""Koin"" to open it and all relies on RNG. There are some handful of them will give you the intended loots but it require ""hearts"" to open it, and the fastest way to gather quickly is by playing the Tower of Time, if you again lucky enough to keep the internet running. 
- Misleading tower of time drop, example: let say one of your gears require to complete at the ""Tag-assist tower""; but instead it give you the: Premier tower"" gear drop  even though you completed the Tag-assist tower.
- Very unsatisfied reward system, it's atrocious.  

Last thing I had say is because of first two reviews I was mad enough to reviewing this game poorly to the developer created such a amazing game, all because of me afraid that I'd spent a broken game that may not worth my time and lavishly throw my money without looking carefully to the main problem of this game that had been on going for a years.

The Krypt is just you opening lootboxes over and over again for stuff you don't even care about. Like if i want enviormental art ill go to the extras and look at it myself. That is the dumbest shit i have ever seen. A glorified lootbox opening sim is what the krypt is.

Online is fun when both players have good internet and play like normal human beings. But when one player has dogshit internet that's when it is just you hoping that you can get a hit in because you're going to get cheesed.

Warner Brother's i hope you old white fucks die. Stop putting micro-transactions in all of your beloved titles. I just don't understand it man. DLC's are fine as long as they aren't bullshit. But these dudes are just putting shit in to be toxic corporate dick heads.

I am hardly an expert on fighting games , more like mediocre to good so I do not have amazing skills at this game, that said If you are going to play this on your PC and you are not a fan of controllers , dont even bother , details to follow : 


Pros :

Amazing graphics.
Many champs to choose from.
More than ok sound effects.
Nice fatalities and moves overall.
It is no Ben hour but the story is nice for such a game and the campain is kinda fun.

The cons (FAR outweight the pros)

AI is overtuned : It does not Semi ""randomly"" chooses attacks / counters and the like , it reacts according to your input so you get fights that even on Medium setting (that for the most part is kinda easy) you can and WILL get matches where the opponent counters....every....single.....move , does not matter what you did, it somehow acted faster with the most appropriate move (even if your punch is basically in the opponents face, you somehow get countered by a ""hard' kick that seems like it would take way more time to land) and proceeds to x20 combo you while you will experience your hits going through your opponent time and again as if he is made ethereal for that milisecond just so he can counter you.

The BLOCK button : no you can no longer press Back to block and quickly press direction keys to block high mid and low attacks, you have to press a button if your reaction time is that of a average human (0,5-1 sec) you can forget it , while the AI will counter,FLAWLESS block ,punish every move, you can basically forget that you have the ability to block.

Limited fatalites : The nice fatalities I mentioned as something positive ? Yeah they are awesome, but you get like 2 of them per champion and they get old really fast when you have already seen them 100 times (brutalities add some variety but they need you to grind them and meet some requirements like do not block in final round to do them , not worth the trouble IMO)

The ""krypt"" : even high end computers get huge FPS drops and even if you dont , this is a grindfest added for no reason in a game like MK.

The MODIFIERS : by far the most moronic , stupid, illogical, god damn aflul idea EVER, the one who thought about it and the one who gave this mostrocity the green light deserve 2 rounds against a real life ninja that is into BDSM and STILL it will not be enough of a punishment

 it is literally there to annoy the hell out of you , forcing you to use ""konsumables"" that you have to farm here and there... for NO reason, this addition is beyond insane to the MK games, it should be scrapped never to return , makes the game a exercise in futility as some opponents have multiple of these things and if you do not wish to grind, and bother with ""konsumables"" you just shoud not play.

 this very addition utterly ruins the tower section of the game , its more like a grindfest of a mini game there to annoy you , if this was a mobile game you would have the ability to pay to get rid of this (as it does seem like a noisance to force you to spent money)

The controls in General : 
With the block button being a huge issue controls in general (for keyboard at least) are wacky , no longer can your moves depend on your direction and key , you have to use ""kombos"" so you can not leg sweep by holding ,down,back , low kick , oh no  you need to press 2 keyes at the same time , makes a actual player (not AI) being practically unable to land combos using a keyboard (yes I know there are people out there that can make it work , but unlike other games that I played the controls are not intuitive, you cant just figure them out as you go )

If you find this on sale ? go for it, it is worth the price, but I would definetely not reccomend it on full price if you use a PC and keyboard (I suppose a controller will make it easier and more fun to play , but just IMO as a verage joe that does not like controllers very much , it is not worth full price)",1587452136,1587452457,False,3,0,0.519685029983520508,1,True,False,False,76561198010320449,33,2,1222,0,1222,1587450988,,

    @Netherealms, most people have jobs (and some, like myself work long hours); do you think we want to come home and grind to get rewarded in the game??  I'd rather spend my time playing Doom Eternal.

- 90% of gameplay is online (and when u play offline you dont get any rewards).  I've got 80GB sitting on my harddrive and I can only play 10% offline with no rewards??  This game should be flagged as bloatware.

- custom characters are stored online and cannot be accessed offline.  The krypt is also online.

However, the game does look great; just remove all the online shit in it.  
@Netherealms, Take a lesson from ID Software.  I bought the Deluxe Edition of Doom Eternal at full price and they deserve every penny I paid for it.  I would have bought the collectors edition (to give them even more money) but I havent seen it available in my country.

To add insult to injury this game is not even on the best sellers list, and its been released for just over a year.

BUT, as almost every review states here, the GODAMN F***ING GRIND. I have 78h into this game right now, but don't you ever let yourself believe I've been playing this game for those many hours. I'd say I spent, for real, 1/4 of it playing it and the rest was grinding. ""Why"", you ask, and I tell you it's because this game has a HUGE amount of cosmetics and augments to your characters, and extra fatalities and brutalities, but guess what, you need to unlock them through koins, hearts or souls, mostly, which is the in-game money. These currencies are obtainable by playing (you only get hearts by executing a fatality or brutality, btw) and the fastest way to get 'em seems to be the Towers, a series of fights that can get quite repetitive (Classic Towers, at least). I tried to use an auto keyboard presser and set the AI to fight for me. I might admit I'm much worse than the AI and even getting long combos, the average number os koins I got from each fight was something like 500-600 koins. Let's consider the cheapest chests you can get in the krypt (where you get most of the cosmetics, fatalities, brutalities, etc) are worth 1600 koins or something like that. And did you know there's a 250k chest there too? And it's kinda normal for chests to cost 10k+? This is the WORST way to keep me playing.
Did you think this atrocity ends here? No, of course not. You can buy with REAL MONEY the koins and this alone justifies me calling this a paywall. It's so damn annoying and wrong it doens't even make sense. Makes me believe the ones who decided upon this and the ones who agreed with this absolute bullsh*t system never played a game before because no one with sanity would  support this terrible idea.
Also the game runs like an old man dying without his legs while having a seizure in the krypts. Oh, and the random CTD's, which I experienced in Injustice 2 too. Yeah, and it's been YEARS since these problems have been reported, but who cares? Surely the developers don't.
Oh, you want to play as Shao Khan, a classic character that SHOULD be in the game? Sure, you can, but better give your wallet again if you didn't preorder.

Don't get me wrong. The game is amazing and fun, but these are problems that made me really angry and I don't think this game deserves full price, so buy it only if you LOVE  to grind to the point it's more important than living your life and if you plan to even stop eating, working and studying just to do the same things over and over again. In case you don't, wait for a BIG sale, like 75%+, NEVER less than this.

And I DO suggest that you look if there are any hacks or trainers to give this grind a middle finger, 'cause it deserves it so hard you can shove your fist on this game's ***.",1587098510,1587098781,False,217,16,0.738074839115142822,4,True,False,False,76561198004930985,920,12,7521,0,4698,1587906603,,

I was a tekken fan 'till i met with Mortal Kombat 9. I can free to say that i was a good tekken player. If u want to be a good player in Tekken you need such a good reflexes but Mortal Kombat 11 is beyond reflexes. In MK11, mind games is everything. Yeah you need to know your character and oppenent for sure. But after all its all about your intelligent. You may know 100 kombos in every single character but once your oppenent is figure it out your playstyle, then you need to know how to break that routine. You can learn a combo. Yeah sure why not? You can practice it and make it perfect! You may never missed it! For sure, your oppenent saw that combo 100 times at least. Because everyone do that combos. You need to know how to break that guard. Then you can do some damage. You need to know when you are going to use your fatal blow cause its too easy to block it. You need to know your getup attacks crushing blows etc..

For the past week or so, I've messed around with the Krypt, the lessons, and the Towers Of Time a bit, but hadn't played the actual P.v.P. mode or the story mode. 

Tonight I sat down and decided to play the story after I had dinner (home made Chicago-style deep dish pizza; very tasty, by the way!), and I sat here for 8 hours and played the whole story through from start to finish. It was epic! It was exciting! It was actually well written and voiced, and (mostly) made sense! While I've always loved MK games, this is a really high-point in the lore of the games.

Unfortunately it feels like lately there have been very little players online playing this game. It takes alot of time to find an online opponent match. There aren't that many 50+ level players in this game anymore compared to few months ago.

Unfortunately this game doesn't have cross play with the consoles, which makes the lack of PC players noticeable. All the serious players are playing on PS4.

Overall the game is really enjoyable and its by far the most time I've spent playing any game in the past few years.

The graphics, the gore, the gameplay mechanics, the design..Devs made a great work..
Story is okish I guess, I was never into the story in FG games, especially in MK but I found it interesting.
Best part of this game are the fatal blows, crushing blows, fatalities and last but not least, brutalities...All these are so well animated and excecuted that even the lamest fatality looks cool (im looking at you kano)..

Are you an old MK fan and wanted to customize your character but you couldnt? Well there you go, the game gives you tons of skins for each character and various cosmetics to please your preference.
You can also customize your variation and make your own special moveset.
Well ofc there are a lot of terrible skins but that's okay..

Roster is very good, this is an unpopular opinion but a lot of beloved characters came back..Shao Kahn, Skarlet, Frost, Shang Tsung, Nightwolf, Sindel, Baraka..Yea there are 5 special forces characters but 3 of them are OG (Jax, Sonya, Johnny) and have been in the game since the first MK games..Cassie is a fan favorite so they should include her ofc...Maybe they could remove Jacqui (she was terrible in MKX) but I don't think that 1 character could make the difference..I am satisfied with the roster and I am happy they made Jacqui appealing.

What I find bad about this game is the lack of gamemodes..I remember in MKX you could customize your local match and play with modifiers against your friend..Also a tag team would be welcomed since there is already something like that in ToT (you can call and control a second character if you are struggling with your current one) so I think its possible to add it for local matches with friends.
Microtransactions sure is a problem but at least they are limited and most of times you already earned the items from ToT..

NO XRAY's, that was the pride and joy of MKX that feature was so great.

17,50288315,english,"-- Random crashes. I lost many ranked points because faulty PC port.
-- No crossplay.

- The story is even worse than in Mortal Kombat X.
- Many functions are ONLINE ONLY.
- Second quality PC port. (Significantly delayed updates, stability issues.)
- Broken hitboxes.
- Shitty flawless blocks mechanic.
- Time towers are as bad as in previous game. They are uninspired and random. It's feels more like a chore than fun. 
- Gauntlet Towers are atrocious. It's torture, not fun. (I miss Challenge Tower from MK 9.) 
- Less pressure on combos. For me it's less fun.
- 'X-rays' (now Fatal Blows) always get bored quickly in previous games. So now they are even more important and I have to watch them in every fight.
- Default character variations for single player/offline are NOT the same variations available in competitive ranked online. WHY? 
- Many skins differs only in small details. (e.g. dozen variants of revenant Liu Kang)
- Preorder DLC. I always hate that kind of thing.
- Double standards with the costumes of male and female characters. Too many naked male chests.
- Some of characters have default revenent appearance in roster select. It looks ugly and anti-climatic.
- No Stage Fatalities.
- Disgusting Frost DLC bait in store. (At first there was no information that she could be unblocked for free.)
- Bad designed characters like Cetrion. Cetrion is top 1 annoying spamer. Her look also sucks.


* Roster MK 11 is slightly better than MK X. But I'm still disappointed. I want to see Rain, Smoke, Tremor, Fujin. Maybe Havik, Reiko or any other 3d era character (just like Frost).
+ Shao Kahn and Noob Saibot in roster.


+ Crushing Blows are an interesting idea.
+ Extreme brutality and gore. Good quality of Fatalities and Brutalities. (but blood looks wierd.)
+ Good amount of content (not always high quality, far too many reskins). 
+ Kombat League (despite many flaws).

24,66800660,english,"After playing up to 755 hours, I decided to hang up on this game and uninstall it. The current meta of this game is ridiculous and needs a complete overhaul of the fighting mechanics along with it's characters. I shouldn't have to force myself to play a character simply because they have better Krushing Blows and a Fatal Blow, which brings me to my next issue. Krushing Blows and Fatal Blows have destroyed this game competitively, because this game makes it safe and easy on casual players to comeback. WHY would you reward the losing player with a Fatal Blow? Other fighting games do this, and I get that, but to be fair, Tekken's Rage Art system is balanced in which the majority of the character's Rage Arts are readable or at least have the same range. MK11 fails to balance out their Fatal Blows because some characters have ranged fatal blows to which all they have to do is get you at least to 35% health and they can win the fight instantly if you happen to make a sudden move, so you essentially have to jump and get caught by their projectiles and losing either way, and to make it worse if you're playing a character like Shao Kahn, which by the way is a DLC character and one of the most powerful characters in the lore and yet is by far the worst character in the game, you're gonna have a rough time trying to avoid the Fatal Blow and also dodging a character like Noob Saibot's zoning, it's not fun. So all you have to do is pick a character like Geras, who has an unreasonable amount of Krushing Blows with a Fatal Blow that has so much range, and combos which you can put little effort into but still deal almost 40% damage and there you go, you're considered an expert, congratulations! I have plenty of other issues about this game, but do not play this game for it's competitive play. It's even worse that this game is not PC friendly as finding players you recently play do not pop up on your Steam recent players, DOES NOT support cross-play, and patches are not implemented the same day consoles get a patch, so you have to wait another week or so which isn't bad, but I'm disappointed that they don't show PC players as much appreciation as consoles.

EDIT::  I have logged some hours on he game and I would like to set the record straight a bit more, it is a fun game, there is a ton of content, the acting and voicing are excellent.  The story however, is just lazy and boring towards the end, makes no sense, and breaks the rules of it own canon several times in the name of ease and expediancy.

 This game man... Wow.  Typical WB game where it stutters, skips, breaks, I mean literally half the fun of this game is just getting it to launch.  Seriously, I try to launch it and 80% no joke, it has to download the .exe binaries to launch because apparently they delete themselves after each attempt.  This is just pure shit and I would stay WAY AWAY from this garbage for a long long time.  They may get it working around the time MK12 comes out.

The story is ok with some obvious lazy writing just to get the script to work and just like MK11 they brought back some awesome characters like the real Smoke, Kano, characters you really REALLY want to play as but no - you are screwed into the new shitty lineup of characters that no one cares about, they didn't even bring Triborg back even though the Lin Kuei Cyber Initiative plays a huge role in this installation.  Seems like ever since MK10, Netherrealms is just lost it's direction and is out of touch with it's one and only IP.  I hope they can light the fire that made them great again - and separate from WB who make games that function worse than EA!

The game (when it actually runs) is decent looking graphically.  The character models and voice acting are genuinely of a superior quality and truly are the best part of the game but as soon as it gets to the actual game play, it get slow and clunky.  It's as if they received a bunch of feedback from people who hated the fast paced gameplay of 10 and 11 and decided to make the fighters move at 1/2 speed.

Honestly I want to like the game but it may be the first time I ever request a refund for a title.  It's a total joke how they shipped it out in this mess.

Add to the fact that they stated the reasoning for less revealing clothing is ""You wouldn't go into combat like that"".  Apparently, it doesn't apply to the male characters which have less.  Add to the fact that their last 10-15 games have had revealing clothing for females.. which only illustrates they're catering to the social justice princesses out there.  Get this:  their latest reasoning is that you should respect women.  While I agree with that statement, I guess in this game nothing says ""respect a woman"" like FINISH HER *performs fatality*!  LOL What a great bunch of morons at the helm!

This is my last MK game and I will not be buying anything else from this company.  If you give in to the social pressure then you can live with consequences of my money going elsewhere.

People recently bought the DLC and got issues.  Guess what got fixed?  Intros and other items related to their upcoming kombat league season.  So in essence, the company's response to their paying DLC customers is basically, ""We'll get to you later - after we get done promoting our more important kombat league.""

This is the second game in a row that they've made in which they just don't seem to care anymore.  For these reasons, I recommend you find something else more entertaining and worthy of your money.  If, however, you must have this game, then wait until it is 50% or more discounted.

The overall story is boring, the game is the same ol' same ol', then throw in some recolored suit models and call it content.  I call it ""lazy development"".

If you're wondering why I have so many hours, it's because I fell asleep sometimes while I was still logged into it, so of course my ""time invested"" is going to be over-inflated.",1559951424,1585867261,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,76561198026462543,117,19,5017,0,5017,1560816526,,

PROS:
[list]
[*]If you're here for the core kombat, you will love this game, it's as refined as it has ever been, you won't care about the grind or anything else cause you'll be looking for more and more excuses to get stuck into kombat
[*]Moved away from MKX's gritty more realistic look in favour of a Olympia style look, with enhanced scenery and looks much more aesthetically pleasing
[*]Mechanically and gameplay wise the game is bloody astoundingly, polished to a mirror shine with a ton of new gameplay tools as well as vastly improved animations
[*]Gives comprehensive but understandable tutorials about the amount of details and characteristics that go into fighting games, while somehow keeping your attention and interest. Finally gives rookies a chance to know how to break into the big leagues
[*]Story is still leagues ahead of the genre and looks like pure artful cinema
[*]Fatal Blows replace X- Rays so instead of having to wait the whole match to land the perfect X- Ray, you're now given a last ditch effort to take the victory from your opponent
[*]Krushing Blows: The benefit and look of X- Rays without interrupting the flow of gameplay, works fantastically
[*]Amplified Moves and Breakers: Gone are the days of only using amplified moves occasionally, it's now an integral part of gameplay and so much more exciting and fun to see as well as play!
[*]Variety: Even after almost 500 hours the game is still gorging up more things to do, whether it be Character Towers, New tower platforms or the glory of the Ranked Kombat League.
[*]Cutomisable gear: enough that you can enjoy certain looks but thankfully far from Injustice 2's unnecessary amount of gear or pay to win enhancers
[*]Taunts: Something I didn't know I needed until i had it. After winning a round your character will mock the other character with a selected animation of those unlocked 
[*]Brutalities: Back and better than ever, with at least 10 for each character
[*]Customisable Presets: Drops MK X's dedicated 3 variations in favour of letting you create your own, to be as overpowered or useless as you please
[*]Fatalities: If that's what you're here for, they're still great, just went for a freeze frame idea at the climactic moment which still works well 
[*]Online focus is much better and actually varied instead of MK X's 3 million Scorpion mains
[/list]

CONS:
[list]
[*]Sonya's witty comebacks and sarcasm have been completely dropped and a lot of her character is lacklustre
[*]Cassie Cage and Jacqui Briggs' entire personalities were given fatalities
        > The snarky, fun and actual enjoyable parts of the characters have been completely dropped in favour or turning them into bad- ass action girls (Because we were apparently sorely lacking in that field). Whereas, the amount of people that sound like they're actually enjoying themselves is limited back to only Kano, Erron Black and Johnny Cage (and Joker but that's with DLC) out of a roster of 25.
[*]The Krypt is honestly just too elaborate at this point, with four different currencies it is a slog, I'll say MK X's Krypt is as good as it gets, as well as the grind which speaking of-
[/list]
- BIGGEST CON: The Grind
[list]
[*]At launch the game's grind was completely fucking abysmal, with one of the side grinds being having to perform a fatality on a each character 50 times for Krypt completion. As well as the Character Tower requirements, it felt like you'd have a second job to do or see it all.
[*]Thankfully, however, thanks to the backlash the Grind has been heavily reduced and is now much more manageable if still occasionally irritating. 
[*]The grind is now just for cosmetic gear or costumes and the occasional brutality, so it can be avoided if you're not interested (But if you are looking for a specific gear you'll just have to hope you get lucky in either the shop or towers. Unfortunately there's no way of getting the one you want without luck)
[/list]

The game now, as opposed to launch, is in a much better place and is well worth the price considering how most new games are double or triple this one's. To a lot it'll be a breath of fresh air to a beloved series and is just as strong if not MIGHTIER than MK X. A very welcome and great sequel.

P.S. Micro- Transactions are only for Easy Fatalities and Time Crystals which are used for the premium shop (Specific Gear or cosmetics). It infringes in no way on anything except cosmetics, plus you get a bunch of time crystals for just completing various modes, so anyone saying it's unplayable is lying.

There is fair enough number of kombos but some characters have more while others eg Kitana gets much less. Fatalities and brutalities are great but we're talking about a Mortal Kombat game here. They're supposed to be great. And bless NRS for making the brutalities require less stuff.

Now let me talk about the nitty and gritty. Two words. Kombat League. I mean you can skip it, but will you be getting the full experience of what the game has to offer? What you're gonna get is spare you the saltiness of it all. The hit boxes are still not fixed, you can get hit from 3 ft away or when the opponent is hitting in the complete opposite direction. Which can cost you a lot of matches especially when that leaves you vulnerable to kombos. You're gonna have to learn to play at least few characters, which is good that the game encourages that, because all of the characters except one, are interesting and fun to take on. 

Another thing I want to address is poking, some players really like that and you have to be spamming block so you don't get hit, which takes a lot out of the fun of playing.

Last but not least, I want to mention streaks in KL and how they make you come back to it everyday so you can get those and how one spammer, poker, jumper wtv can cost you tens of those.

It's your choice if you want to get the game and you're a fan of the Mortal Kombat like me, you should get it. But I'd advise to stay out of Kombat League if you want to keep loving the game.

My Own Opinion, You may Comment Below, You can even
Agree or Disagree... I'll leave that up to you...

------------------------------------------------------------

I have completely removed my Review, & 
have changed my Review due to a Recent Development in 
the Gaming Industry... 

In the past, I claimed MK11 had problems, but it was still a great 
game, & was unsure if i'd suggest picking up, or not buying it... 

It has probably the best Fight Mechanics of any Fighting Game right now... 

Well, this all changes as of today... While that may have been true? 
It is still true now, so why the change, you might ask? 

Because in 2019, it was given the Best Game of the Year Award 
for a Game you suck at, but going into 2020, however? 

Just stay the heck away from Mortal Kombat 11, just stay away, 
I don't know what the deal is with Game Developers in today's ERA, 
but just don't... I think Game Developers of 2020 have practically just 
lost their minds, & gone bat sht crazy lately... 

Just no, you do not wanna buy this... We are due for Season 2 DLC, 
but i'm only speculating this just means more problems for the Game... 
It's just 1 big Joke now... 

Ed Boon rocks, & MK is great, but just don't bother with MK11... 
I wouldn't even consider buying a Newer Game in 2020 at all, it's that bad... 
MK11 isn't the only Game right now with this problem, & it's not going to be 
the last... Srry, but I do not Recommend it, not in it's current state...",1561882084,1585536668,False,0,0,0.459346175193786621,0,True,False,False,76561198002868371,89,11,15790,0,4954,1588597346,,

26,65813142,english,"I have played this game for over 8 hours and at the end of the day, i still find myself going back to MKX. The Story wasn't Half good and except for the visuals everything else just feels like a downgrade from MKX. You just fell the loss of fluidity that they had in the previous versions of the game. Also they have reduced the number of special moves on characters which kinda fells like looking at repetitive animation over and over again after a point. and they have also removed a few character and filled in with few new ones but I kinda wanted Kenshi or atleast the rooster to be carried over. IDK if there is glitch or the cinematics are capped at 30fps while kombat is at 60. The transition is kinda weird. But still at the end of the day the Krypt (which i really enjoyed in MKX) has improved a lot. Great job on 3rd person movement in Krypt. And the overall graphics of the game is just stunning (which is the best way i could muster up to put in words).

Pros:
Improved Krypt.
Amazing Graphics.
Great new characters.


Cons: 
Game Mechanics.
Missing characters.
Lesser Moves.
Technical glitches. (like the 60 fps issue i mentioned)
Missing character fluidity.


Would i recommend this game for full prize: Not yet.
Would i recommend this game on discount: Yes!! Sure!

If you have cash to burn, definitely go for MKXL.

37,65467303,english,"So after a week of playing, 7/10 Stars to 2/10 Stars. Here's Why:

Pros:
After playing this game, I have so much respect for high level players pulling off sick combos on youtube. Kombos are tricky but after lots of practice its satisfying when done right! 

Graphics are gorgeous, story is definitely more refined (i kept wanting to know how it ends and finished it in one sitting, perhaps in 3 hours?), motion captured performances and voice acting are brilliant! Towers of Time can be grindy (for skins, augments, etc) but its a fun kinda grind. Only reason I got this game was for Spawn and I believe NRS did him justice :)

Cons:
1) Even with a stable 300mbps connection, 250+ms ping is normal....making Online competetive play almost impossible. This is very frustrating! Online players can be toxic.
2) Connection to server issues in Krypt mode. Opening chests or just roaming around will cause a server connection error and return you to Main Menu screen. 
**3) As of 24/3/20 the game is completely broken. Online features (Towers of Time, Krypt, Online mode) takes forever to load ultimately crashing out to main menu. Before ammending this review...I waited patiently for 30 minutes today for the screen to load before giving up.
4) Customer service & support pretty non existent. While they are aware about server issues, Just google their response and you will find their last twitter update was 6 days ago. No ETA about a fix.
5) Latest PC patch dated 23/03/20 did not address server issue. NRS blames issue on customers.

Conclusion:
Don't buy this game now. Perhaps until COVID19 dies over and NRS have enough people to work on this game again... I guess?

I mean, this is obviously a fighting game, so it's not like you can just win automatically by picking the ""meta"", getting better at a character requires getting better at the game to a certain degree, but after that point, when it's time to actually ""learn"" that character, some characters aren't even worth it because they will lose all matchups against an opponent of the same skill level until they get patched.

Mortal Kombat 11 is a sequel to Mortal Kombat X(no fucking shit) and story is about Kronika(Shinnok's Mommy) trying to create some new timeline called ""New Era"" and Earthrealm bitches try to stop Shinnok's Mommy so that she can't create New Era.Lets make this review bit more easy to read and split this into Parts

Part 1 The Story:Its bad and its even worse than Mortal Kombat X which is a achievment on its own.Writer of this story is the person who wrote the comics of Mortal Kombat X so of course story is going to be trash.Oh and lets not forget that cutscenes are FUCKING MOVIE FILES THAT COUSES THE GAME TO BECOME 60 FUCKING GB.Enough about story mode bullcrap lets go on Part 2
Edit:I narrow this part down to tone the review becouse I have a lot to say

Part 2 Dmitri Vegas:This part actually belonged to Ronda Rousey however the new Sub Zero skin manage to surpass her horrible voice acting.He is so bad that I gave this part to him.This DJ didnt even TRIED to get into Sub-Zero's characher and ruined his voice.Thankfully I can simply ignore his skin and restore Sub-Zero epic voice back. 
Edit:Im also saying sorry to Noob's Voice Actor.You are god compare to this b*tch

Welcome to the new Ronda part.Since I replaced her part with Dmitri Vegas here is my Ronda Opinion:Ronda tried but FAƒ∞LED when it comes to Sonya Blade.She did her best however it wasn't something high quality becouse..well she is not a voice actress.Is it still bad? Yes. Is it bad as Dmitri? No.

Part 3 Sexist Desings:Desings of the female fighters are sexist AGAIN but this time they are not strippers.They are covered head to toe and with exception of Sonya Blade none of them has a revaling kosmetics while all males are shirtless(EVEN THE REVENANT MALES ARE SHIRTLESS) fuck out of here with that nonsense.

Part 4 Gameplay:Well I'll be damned they actually deployed a balance patch to make gameplay bareable.After the patch gameplay become stunning and this is actually the best gameplay the series can ever have.Its smooth,balanced and overrall a fun gameplay.Congrats NRS you finally did something great.

Part 5 Roster:Roster is weak and no its not becouse Mileena isn't in the roster you idiots that think we only want Mileena.Its becouse the lack of new fighters.I mean yea there 2 new fighters but only 2..even Mortal Kombat X had more newcomers than this bullshit.Not only that they are some questionable fighters in the roster as well for example Kombat Kids recived a major backlash yet Cassie and Jacqui are in the Roster where Takeda and Kung Jin doesnt exist..why? well its simple its becouse we need a girl that has depressed dad and we need a girl that was once a popular highschool student that every jock wanted to fuck also the way they handled some fighters is low I mean REAL low.People wanted Reptile so as a fan service Erron Black has Reptile's Venom.People wanted Mileena so as a fan service Kitana has Mileena's Sai.People wanted Ermac,Rain,Smoke and very little people -inculiding me- wanted Kintaro so they give Shang Tsung ALL OF THEM.I mean atleast Kintaro Fatality is a reffrence to his Mortal Kombat 2 Fatality but what about the ninjas? Where is my NINJAS!!

Part 6 Towers:Towers are seperated to 2 catgories in this game
                                                                                                      
Lets check them out shall we?

1-Klassic Towers:As the name suggest theese are the Klassic towers in every Mortal Kombat game but this time it follow the Mortal Kombat 3 logic where you get to choose 3 types of towers.They are the same shit but each type has different amount of opponents to beat.There also returning towers from Mortal Kombat X such as Survivor and Endless which is pretty cools aswell

2-Tower of Time:Theese are some interesting shit.Upon entering this place you will be faced with a unskipable tutorial couse why not.After beating the tutorial towers will open up and as the name suggest theese towers have limited REAL time.This means you have to beat them for special prices before the timer runs out.You can also summon a Key Tower with a Tower of Time Key -which I have no idea how to get them- that lasts 59 Minutes so you can some good shit.There is also Charachter Towers that you can summon with some gold dedicated to a single charachter theese towers have unlimited time so you can complete them whenever you like and once you beat a tower you can summon 3 more for that fighter but each will be more expensive than the other.Whats the purpose of this? MORE GOODIES and some Replay Value to the game.There is also a uniquie Tower which has unlimited time is Gauntlet which is a Hardcore Tower that is desinged to fuck your ass.There is also some towers where you are forced to watch your fighter FIGHT for you so you can be a lazy piece of shit for a while..WHY. Towers of Time from quality and fun perspective its 8/10

Part 7 AI Battle:This useless piece of trash is basiacly online mode but instead of fighting yourself AI fights for you..wooo how fun..fuck out of here

Part 8 Custimazation:This shit is good.You can custimize your fighters gear,special moves,AI Behavior,Kosmetics,Variation name and icon,Intro and Victory animations.Its just fucking perfect.The only issue is that Jacqui's gears are her left and right gauntlets cousing some unmatching crappy look but other than that this is some perfection right here

Part 9 Online Mode:I mean you still gonna get scorpion...but his spamming ass can no longer get you raged couse BALANCE PATCH.Online is finally a fun place to hang out since all the braindead stuff is finally gone.

Edit:BONUS THE KRYPT:I forgot to add this when I was writing this review but krypt is a walking flaw.Some key items have a ridiclous way of getting.Entire krypt is random which is not a good thing.Atleast game can now tell you where to find the item you want so you dont hopelessy spent your coins on a Loot Shrine

Edit:It Launched horrible however developers managed to fix it to make it a more enjoyable experience.Game still has its flaws but in its current condition the good outweights the bad so I definetly recommend you buying this..WHEN ITS ON SALE

Edit:Balance is basiaclly non-existent to skip this game entirely

26,50441443,english,"Gonna compare this a lot to MK X, and in some moments to MK 2011.

A very good MK game this time, new mechanics are cool and make up for more strategy in fights. In my opinion, it's the best fighting mechanic since the reboot (MK 2011), they're very engaging and more strategic, with good punishes if you know how to do them. On a fighting level, it's absolutely well done, I'm impressed because at first when I saw gameplay reveal I didn't quite like them. But they've nailed it. Krushing Blows and Fatal Blows are well mixed into the fighting, and it's never boring to use them at advantages. Unlike previously X-ray, you can only do a Fatal Blow one time at the whole match. Use it wisely or else.

On the technical side, the game is undoubtedly impressive. The animation quality is much improved since MK X, very nice looking, crispy visuals with good quality textures. Backgrounds of Arenas are a breath of fresh air since MK X. Totally an improvement here. Many areas to fight and graphics to enjoy. 

Good soundtrack. I've liked the music. It holds tension at moments and overall composition is epic. Sounding like a movie sometimes. Good thing that I've always liked orchestral score I guess. Many of music from stages are memorizing, which is exactly what a good soundtrack should do. Great job here with sounds as well, punches and kicks are satisfying to hear. 

It's definitely an evolution for NRS to create this piece of the chapter since MK 2011. Every technical aspect is improved and we've probably reached the current-gen fighting potential regarding the technology, but I'm no expert here.

The Krypt is back and it's the most interesting aspect in the game for me. It's the biggest fan-service ever given to MK fans. Absolutely nicely recreated Shang Tsung island, with many of its mysteries and places. AMAZING third-person mini-adventure game. Loved every second of grind. Granted I'm willing to grind, and sometimes I grind that hard that it may seem like it's my second job. And frankly, I love it this way, this expands the game lifecycle and I'm not even complaining.

Now...
The story mode sucks, absolutely garbaged. The whole plotline has so many holes it's not even funny. The whole build-up is stupid and meaningless. The Kronika boss is just bad. On a visual level, on a plot level, on a lore level. The design is boring and uninspiring, the white armor feels like it was ripped off from the Injustice series. You won't feel a threat from her just because she's constantly telling about rewinding time with (and still fails to do so, duh) This chapter of MK effectively terminates interesting MK X arcs and just butchers them. You won't see the continuation of Dark Raiden arc, that MK X built up for. You won't even see the newcomers, since MK 2011, like Noob Saibot given much time. He only appears in 2 fucking scenes, and there was no explanation of how he got back from the dead. Unless, ""plot hole Kronika"" ""restores"" him from another timeline, but even the story mode is a massive disappointment, but I guess that's what you get since MK X average new kids arc, that keeps the trend here with un-interesting Kronika and friends bullshit. MK 2011 still has to date the best story mode. And you know it's a shame when the intro cutscene of the story mode is better than the final scene.
Not happy with a story mode, not one bit.

As far as technical glitches/bugs - devs doing their best, and it's a really nice PC port gotta admit. While there are many desync issues online, it remains a tradition now, especially from NRS I guess. Gotta wait a bit to fix it out a little.

So overall this game is really a special one for me because I've always liked the MK and played since the first game. But the story mode villain and the direction itself it went on is rather disappointing. It could have been much better and engaging, but the whole time rewind crap is not worth it unless you can tie in it without the errors. Especially in the series, that always had strong lore. This never would have happened with John Tobias on board.

But I guess you can't have a perfect game, in a nonperfect world.
So, in the end, I am happy, and I am not so happy at the same time, and this is the balance, the life balance of the universe.

51,65185023,english,"CUSTOMIZATION- I like this game, however unlike Injustice 2, after you beat the story, do most of the Krypt, and do a couple of fights, you've seen everything the game has to offer. The reason Injustice 2 worked so well for me was because with each fight I actually felt like my character was growing more powerful and you could see that progression in the way your character changed overtime. In MK 11 however that's been died down, while I appreciate the ability to create our own variants the character customization feels very lackluster. This to me is the games biggest downfall, it feels like a skeleton of what we could have gotten.

GAME PLAY- The fighting itself is of course the game biggest strength. Everything is silky smooth, cinematic as hell, and with the amazing addition of the custom variants it makes your combos as cool as ever. Theirs really not much else to say other than NetherRealms is still the undisputed king of fighting games and story telling.

OVERALL- Overall I think this game is worth a discounted buy, after you beat the story and seen everything previously mentioned there's not much to do besides online battles. Even then in my time with the Towers of Time and online battles in total up to this point I have had 6 hard crashes. The time crystals confused me because overall their pretty much useless, I feel that some corporate overlord demanded micro transactions but everything in the store that isn't a timed exclusive is obtainable in the game.

RATING- At full price this game is a hard 5/10, but at any discounted price it's anywhere between a 7/10 and a 8/10. I just don't feel like we got a full experience and that's a first time for me with NetherRealms, I believe this is because of the sudden removal of leveling up your favorite character and watching them grow.",1584416961,1584416961,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198181174035,65,6,3027,0,1942,1598414512,,

28,64886299,english,"This game is both great, but painful at the same time, i'll try and break it down. 

The game play itself is fun, competitive and engaging. Each character feels unique and i think you can find a character you gel with quite easily, whether that be from a game play or aesthetic standpoint. The towers. krypt and story (whether that be the character endings or the in game story) add a level of longevity to the game. 

That aside, I cannot for the life of me excuse nether realms monetisation of its games. The gear system, both in this and in injustice 2 have an unnecessary grind to it that doesn't add to any ""fun"" factor in the game. You have to level your new gear to fill these ""gem"" slots, which is a chore. Gear is locked away behind various arbatory tasks, which vary in difficulty and you can find a good deal of stuff in the Krypt. 

The biggest issue mainly is the consumable system, whereby you can make your character better against certain in game jank. All of these are difficult to find and are stupid. This is a fighting game, the ability to complete a task in this game should only be determined by your skill level and not by your wallet size.

Ultmately, i think there is *JUST* enough content without the ridiculous monetisation systems to justify a purchase at a sale price. However a certain amount of that offline playability is lost when you do take into account the grind and the bullshit.

The relationships of the characters and the old and new versions of the characters were done perfectly. I would honestly give the story a 10/10 but I am a little bias. Even if you don't want to competitively play online in the Kombat League, there is a normal versus mode for more casual players. If online isn't your thing, don't worry because there is still much to do. The towers of time allow you to play the CPU and unlock gear and skins for your characters. You also get coins, souls, and hearts which are all currency you can spend at the Krypt. The Krpyt is Shang Tsung's ( a dlc character in MK 11) island. You can explore for hours and hours with many easter eggs for Mortal Kombat fans plus you can open chests and solve puzzles to get more gear, skins, and most of all, fatalities and brutalities. What makes Mortal Kombat what it is, is the gruesome fatalities and brutalities. Without them, Mortal Kombat wouldn't even be the same game.

I clocked in easily over 9 hours on the story mode ( an hour almost on the final boss alone...we'll get to that). The story mode plays out like a movie with long cutscenes broken up by fights here and there. You can skip the cutscenes but honestly I found myself sitting back and enjoying the action, it was like i was watching a Netflix mini series. The only flaw i can find in this games story mode is the final boss. Kronika is ridiculous. You cannot combo her or use specials, brutalities, or anything for that matter. All you can do is punch and kick her while she throws all kinds of time blasts at you and randomly teleports to you. This bossfight really put a screeching halt to the pace of the game and ruined an otherwise perfect story mode in my opinion.

Towers and Towers of Time are great for keeping you coming back and testing your might against the AI. I don't really care for the towers of time challenges as they seem to be a way to get you to use all your ""Konsumables"" so you can pay for some more...

37,64257928,english,"It's definitely a good Mortal Kombat game. However the criticism about it being expensive and a bit of a grind is not incorrect. I bought it on sale and don't really feel the need to grind. I like that after a few hours of playing, I can dive into the Krypt and get some goodies. 

Thanks to the great character design and RPG-lite elements I really like to stick to one character (Kitana) and improve both my skill with her and her equipment.

Pro's
- Best looking characters in Mortal Kombat (or every fighter?) history. Which in turn gives each character more personality
- A lot of customisation
- Equipment slots allow to improve your fighter slightly
- Excellent tutorials
- Finishers look good
- Decent roster
- Krypt is not too bad
- Awesome keyboard & mouse RGB effects give a nice arcade vibe
- OK bossfight
- Story looks good, but I have no clue what is happening :p

Con's
- Roster does miss some classics: Reptile, Smoke, Cyborgs, Sheeva, Kenshi, ...
- Having to pay for some additional characters feels unfair for a 60‚Ç¨ game
- Krypt is randomised, you have to spend koins not knowing what you'll get for in return. This especially sucks if you focus on one character
- Crashes, but this should be fixed with the latest nvidia driver
- Some characters on the roster I really don't like: The Collector & Terminator. I would have very much preferred that they've been replaced with some of the classics.

-Most of the skins for the fighters are really boring and basic

-Scummy business practices, as in, you can buy Frost early but you can earn her in game and they try to hide that fact from the player.
-Revenant versions of characters.. AGAIN. Seems overplayed at this point and really boring, plus Raiden spends less than half the game as evil Raiden and his skin by default is evil Raiden?
-Main villain is super boring and has a lame design. Same for the elder god that wastes a character select spot.

""I don't see why it's got mixed reviews. Sure it took a while for launch the balance patch to come out but that aside it's probably the most complete package in terms of fighting games since Killer Instinct""

Oh how I regret uttering those words in the opening month of this game. Little did I know of the horror to come that is NRS pc support.

I won't lie, the game looks gorgeous. 
The story mode once again raises the bar for fighting games that only NRS seem interesting in raising.
The netcode: Rollback. Say no more
Very easy to pick up a character thanks to both individual tutorials and the UI in practice mode. From framedata in the movelist to being able to pin multiple moves/strings to screen to refer to while experimenting.

Just one BIG problem. Good luck being able to play this for any length of time.
Since the Terminator update stability took a hit. For no reason game would start crashing every now and then.
Then the Sindel update came, lucky if the game lasted an hour. Some people reported not being able to even launch the game.

Note how I mention the dlc launches characters as reference. That's cause unlike console which has balance patches and bug fixes they wait until the DLC to ""patch"" anything meaning the PC version could at any point be multiple updates behind. You can tune into twitch and literally watch someone playing a different version of the game. Cool combo bro, shame I can't steal it.

That's when I got my hopes up.
14th January.
An update. 
No DLC that day.

Could it be? A patch to address these issues?

6,63751529,english,"This game spits in my face. I would name it to spit if I have to. There are many problems with this game and I‚Äôll run through all of them. But in short, don‚Äôt buy unless you‚Äôre a fan

My biggest issue is modifiers. I like d them in the old days of MK like they spice the gameplay up with new toys. In this game there used so aimlessly and there so broken, there‚Äôs this mine modifier that just ruins everything, you can‚Äôt move at all or you just go from mine to mine taking damage and you just die by moving a step over it. Then there is this freeze touch one which if you get hit once you get frozen over time but the rate which you freeze is so consistent so you get frozen, they hit you, then freeze again and rinse and repeat until it‚Äôs over. It can be tolerable but its the only way to unlock the gear and cosmetics and its just spiteful because its a game of how many unfair matches you play till you win. It has nothing to do with skill and add that with most towers they have more health and damage and most of the time, it says there isn‚Äôt a modifier but then a quarter of there health goes down and then one pops up and you don‚Äôt know what it is. 

Consumables are its ‚Äúfix‚Äù to its problem. It makes you rely on them to get by, so you just press one button then your health is up 50 percent at a fast rate which is just bullshit and makes me angry cause its like if you get as many blood vials you want in bloodborne.  So it‚Äôs not fun and has no skill at all, I try to avoid the consumables but it makes me pissed that it‚Äôs either an unfair fight or an unfair fight to the terrible ai

Inconsistent difficulty. I‚Äôve been playing these games since Armageddon and I‚Äôd say I‚Äôm pretty alright with mortal kombat. But medium in this game means hard and hard means hard and very hard. The attacks and moves the ai does are just baffling about how good there timing and accuracy is especially on medium and i never had a problem with the ai in injustice 2 or 1 and the previous mortal kombats but its so shitty with how unfair it is and add that with the ladders and towers with the modifiers and then the extra health and damage. It‚Äôs just insulting and the fatal blow mechanics is neat in concept and i like it but I don‚Äôt know how enemies can breach through it with one hit which ruins it 

Customization is so shitty. There are like 6 or 8 outfits not including the DLC characters, I think they have half of what the others get but I‚Äôm gonna use terminator as an example. All I want is to have all the outfits from all the movies like the weird punk outfit in the first film or the cool biker look in t2 but I get none and if it remotely looks like it, you get elderly Arnold which looks like nothing alike of it. I say 8 outfits out of the 60 because all of them are differently colored but it looks so shitty and doesn‚Äôt match but you have no control of what you get. It‚Äôs random with what you get which you have to grind on one of the 5 towers multiple times and wait for it to be over to which is like an hour for one and the others are like full days till a new one gets in. So do the tower over and over until you get what you want. In doom, you can either rank up to get the gear you want or do a challenge to get it which is rewarding either way, but in this, you don‚Äôt even know what you‚Äôre getting. One little thing I wanted to add, there‚Äôs this awesome design for the joker and it‚Äôs in the game and I was like hell yeah imma look metal but then Netherrealm is like we gotta sell more DLC outfits that don‚Äôt make sense. Make Geras look like Darkseid, fuck it even though it‚Äôd be better in Shao Kahn and they give that joker cosmetic to noob. It‚Äôs now more insulting to the fans

The Story is just nothing, I can almost forgive any game if I‚Äôm invested in the story but it‚Äôs just the same shit. Get the same writer from the previous two titles and make another bland story. My biggest pet peeve is that every chapter has 4 fights and no matter what it will happen. So they force conflict with characters and there like, oh it‚Äôs a misunderstanding and move on which it didn‚Äôt matter. The actress for Sonya blade is so awful like she has no direction and it sounds like she is just reading the lines for the first time. They need a new writer and to stop that stupid trope. It just wastes time and is meaningless. I‚Äôm not gonna mention the time travel because that‚Äôs its own awful can of worms and in short it makes no sense at all. I wish it was like MK Deception like why can‚Äôt they make the story a brawler and a fighter again, oh it‚Äôs easy its cause it‚Äôs more work and there just lazy. They have characters that you fight in this game like Cyrax and Sektor but you can‚Äôt play with them and there are literally two empty spots on the roster and i can just think like they probably meant to put them in there but forgot. Also don‚Äôt buy Shang Tsung, most of his moves are reused from other characters in previous entries like they re-use rains kick and reptiles slide and smoke perry, etc. They reuse so much shit and i don‚Äôt know what most of there time has been used on. In a game about killing people in brutal ways, no one dies in the story like maybe two characters but their past self just goes on like the same character is there just the other one died. Like Scorpion has like three misunderstandings in his chapter and it just pissed me off. You can take like so many people out of the story and it won‚Äôt matter like Jaqui or Jax or Cassie or Sonya. The new crew I hated in MK 10 was just ugh worthy, cause it felt like a teen action show on the c&w but in this, no one does anything except argue and their decisions don‚Äôt matter. Raiden and Lui Kang is interesting and more compelling then the other bozos but they‚Äôre barely in it and the villain is just awful, gameplay and story-wise like its unfair and no way of know what‚Äôs gonna happen unlike Shao Kahn in MK 9 which was done amazingly and felt so empowered when i won but in this, I didn‚Äôt care about her and didn‚Äôt understand her motivation at all like why does she hate this timeline, like her son got killed even though he tried to kill earth like shes never explored as a character. It reminds me of the story of the Justice League like there aren‚Äôt any characters or development with them, it tries to be epic like Avengers, and the villain sucks. This is like the Justice League of Mortal Kombat

So this game is shit but I like the roster. I love Erron Black and Kabal but they could‚Äôve added more. Like, get a Striker or Kenshi and many others. They can easily plug them in but then I guess how many customization options matter most then variety. Like armageddon had more than 40 characters from what I remember. But this game just makes me angry, it‚Äôs not rewarding and it‚Äôs entertaining and the gameplay is somewhat solid without the ai and modifiers but Injustice 2 did it so well with the balance of this shit but I don‚Äôt know how ed boon fucked up this badly. I give this a 3\10, closer to a 2 then a four.

I was surprised at how boring this game is. Ive been playing mortal kombat since I was in elementary school on Mortal Kombat 1. All the way back in like 3rd or 4th grade. It was 1992! The devs have completely lost sight of this series. It just feels boring now. And the combat (kombat) is a serious step backwards. I dont care if it's 2D space or a 3D arena, the kombat is just boring af. Even Injustice 1 and 2 played better than this. In fact, if they would update Injustice 2 and give us some awesome fatalities and more story, Id just go back to that. Yes, I am aware they play similarly. Injustice plays waaaay better IMO.

Dont get me wrong, this game does A LOT of things right. 

The fatalities are the best they've ever been

The animation, of course, is the best it's ever been

The Krypt is really neat and finally brought single player Kontent to fighting games again. I dont have a small penis so my life isn't structured around fighting games online devoid of content. Some excellent unlocks in the krypt

HOWEVER, the game does a lot that is just odd or bad

Missing some extremely popular mainstays of the series. How tf do you not have Reptile as a playable karacter? Is this a joke?

The guests are garbage. Terminator? Really? He is the most out of place character in the entire series' history. Even worse than MoKap or however it was spelled (mocap = motion capture) And the Joker? Why!? How did you fail at that when just a few years ago you released Injustice 1 and then 2 with a Joker who played SO SO much better and was more fun. 

The animations are stiff and klunky (haaaa clunky with a k!)

The roster is paltry

The woke bullshit is embarrassing. Especially Jacqui Briggs, the joke that no one wanted. The alphabet mafia is probably thrilled though. Just they typical unnecessary bullshit to cater to sick, evil people who are so racist and obsessed with sexual identity all they can think about is skin color and what gender a fictional character wants to bang. 

It's probably time for a lore revamp tbh. It's gotten to the point where immersion in the story is gone. It tries to be a serious, violent game, but comes off now as just cheesy and unbelievable. 

I wish we had an option for between yes and no on ""would you recommend"". It's not a bad game at all. It's just so boring and could have been waaaay better.  I wouldn't recommend it. But I get its appeal.

Pros:
Looks great, sounds okay.

Cons:

Overall feel, flow of the gameplay sucks ass, let's be real here.
The grabs are a guessing game, tekken for example does this right.

The defensive meter sucks, in mk9 and mkx you traded it off for your x-ray or AMP moves.

Speaking of: Xrays are now called fatal blows, they can only be done once per match, and only under 30% hp, AND THEY ALSO HAVE ARMOR ON THEM HELLO.
Removing all ""risk"" of using them. The offensive bar is okay IMO, works fine, defensive part sucks ass. Too many reasons to explain it really, on paper all this works fine.

The combos are up next.. or lack there of, each character has one combo you do, others aren't worth doing

Which brings me to balance

all i have to say for balance is kitana dmg scaling and also geras lmao

overall pretty dissapointed 6.5/10

Edit: Hits dont feel good also, hitting someone with a big boye attack should feel great, here you just kinda go ""ok""

Fatal blows and fatalities are  step back

Fatal blows much much more, they feel HORRIBLE HOOOOOOOORRIBLE, with the x-ray part of them just not existing, giving it to krushing blows, which are one hit x ray moves, that kinda suck also, they have more ""impact"" but still nothing close, just have a look at some MKX or even MK9 xrays, they feel great.",1580753254,1581704031,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198124146050,238,93,12997,0,11516,1600542870,,

Fast forward, 70 hours of play time, and I'm still shit. I still get flogged in online matches, but I do actually win sometimes. I now know how to button mash with Kano. I still wonder how people can memorise multiple characters move sets, while I'm here only knowing the power of Kano's ball.

- Excellent core gameplay due to slower pace which leads to more precise and tactics than ""juggling simulator"" MKX
- The story is kinda cool, feels like an action movie, if The Last Of Us and The Witcher 3 are Oscar-nominated movies, this game would be Fast And Furious
- Deep kustomization
- No more ""Jumpscare simulator"" krypt

- Augments??? In a fighting game?? This is the first time i see something like this because augments only applied to RPGs, and this element also makes the game become unnecessarily confused
- Multiple kurrencies, also first time on a AAA game because this only exists in mobile games -> shady devs
- The Krypt is total shit due to constant disconnection
- Lack of creativity in term of kustomization, instead of cool skins like MK9 and MKX, now we have color-changing

I deleted many paragraphs from the ,,Cons'' section since they were no longer valid. The game launched with extremely hard, broken towers that made grinding for gear very tiring. It left the impression NRS was encouraging microtransactions, leaving players no other choice but to purchase skins directly from the premium store. They listened to the feedback and fixed this major issue in their first patch. Part of the Krypt is still RNG based but honestly, exploring it is so addictive, it doesn't matter. Besides, they made it all fairly easy to unlock after the first patch. Since all the frustrating problems are now gone, out of respect of NRS for listening to us, I thought that leaving this review like this was dishonest and decided to change it to positive.


Pros

- The game runs great, even smoother than Injustice 2 which is surprising.
- The story is great and the characters really get to show their personality in the story, intro dialogues, their fighting style and animations. Huge improvement from MK X.
- Many throwbacks to the Klassics. Some brutalities, fatalities, costumes and movie references will easily make a long-term MK fan nostalgic.
- The visuals are the sickest they've ever been and could easily challenge any highly rated AAA action game! The stages look alive and stunningly beautiful with my favorite being Shirai Ryu Fire Garden. Cinematics are top notch and motion capture tech makes the characters look real. The textures, especially costume materials look so impressive and real, you can easily distinguish skin, leather, metal, etc. which has never been done in fighting games to this extent. Fighting move animations have also been greatly improved after the ugly disaster that was MK X and Injustice 2.
- The new mechanics are a breath of fresh air that stay true to MK fighting style while offering something new. Also, as a big fan of MK9 I really appreciate that the game is more neutral based again and that dash cancels are back. It‚Äôs so good that this part alone will keep me invested in this game for years.
- The tutorials are very well done and teach you everything you need to know from basics to more advanced moves, strategies and frame data. Practice mode is also greatly improved, now with the option to display frame data for moves in the corner of the screen.
- The roster is pretty good with many Klassic/new fan favorites and some not so favorites‚Ä¶ It just saddens me that they replaced iconic characters like Ermac, Mileena, Smoke to make space for potential guest characters later in DLCs and some obscure characters like Cetrion, Kollector and Geras who turned out to be hardly interesting in the story and were obviously there for a single game. Overall, still a better roster than MK X.
- For the first time, they give you an option to change the announcer voice in the audio options. Right now there are Klassic, Kronika and Shao Kahn announcers. More to come.
- Even though they‚Äôve changed some of the voice actors that I liked in MK X, the voice acting is still done really well, except for Ronda Rousey as Sonya of course‚Ä¶ What were they thinking‚Ä¶

Cons

- ,,Easy Fatalities'' are back? Really? ,,That's pathetic''...
- It seems that the developers lied when they said they would never repeat that MK X NPC thing ever again. Yet in the story mode you fight 2 fan favorite characters Cyrax & Sektor with their cool new design, but you can‚Äôt play them‚Ä¶ Once again, a very poor choice from NRS. I‚Äôll edit this part out if they end up as DLC though.
- Towers and even character customization is locked out if you can't connect to a server. This sucks and doesn't make sense. Please make them always accessible as they were in Injustice 2!
- The reflection of real life politics in the game‚Ä¶ As a gamer who values games as a way of escapism, I found some dialogues(like Trump references in Shao Kahn‚Äôs lines) and character endings very cringeworthy (like turning Jax into some random black dude that uses the term ,,woke‚Äô‚Äô unironically and uses the power of time to end black slavery centuries ago. People expect to see something interesting in the character endings, instead of the most cliche thing a stereotypical 2019 American leftist can come up with. What is this, MK or Supergirl TV show?). That and the stupid statement they made about female costumes. To keep it short, here's a video that sums it up. 
https://youtu.be/1Rm1I3zzto0 
When you shove politics in games and divide your customers, make sure you‚Äôre ready to swallow the backlash.
- To finalize it, I want to address a big problem that has been common in the latest NRS games. They tend to present us ,,a cool new feature‚Äô‚Äô in every title and make it sound as one of the most important selling points of their games only to make them seem pointless once a game is released. This time it‚Äôs a ,,create your own variation‚Äô‚Äô feature. This is Injustice 2 ,,custom moves‚Äô‚Äô thing all over again, where even average players would force you to use default presets online. It sounds cool on paper but in the end it turns out hard to balance. Now they‚Äôre making ,,tournament presets‚Äô‚Äô that they will focus for balancing. So I‚Äôm asking‚Ä¶What was the point of introducing this feature in the first place if MK X style variations(that I also hated and hoped in the next MK I would have a choice to design my own character instead of restricting him/her into 3 parts) were what we were going to get in the end? Of course balancing it is hard but they should have been prepared for it when they were designing the game. Another feature with great potential wasted! And it sucks because knowing NRS, they will probably drop its support in couple of years after the release and start working on a new game where they will try to implement ,,a better version'' of that feature, instead of fixing it in the existing game. Although, WB announced that a long time support is planned for this game so there‚Äôs hope. 

Overall, the game is very enjoyable and I absolutely recommend getting it whether you're an MK fan or not. Even if you're not, there's a big chance you'll become one. It offers you great deal of enjoyable content: Great story mode, rich character customizations with the Krypt, fresh fighting mechanics with neat tutorial lessons. 
I'm looking forward to hearing more about future content that NRS has in store for us. First Kombat Pack is already announced and Ed Boon promised he's going to bring more fan favorite fighters as DLCs so I'm very excited.

If the connection drops, you lose access to single player content. The game uses a terrible grind system to entice people to buy content with microtransactions. The developers have said that ""they are working on a fix"", but their fix is to fudge the numbers somewhat to make the grind a little bit easier, not remove the grind completely. But that is the only fix. Remove consumables, remove assists, remove augments, remove random drops, remove randomization from the krypt.

Read this:

The game also crashes here and there in the menus, which can cause data loss.

Until all these things are fixed (and let's be honest, they never will be), I cannot recommend this. It's a shame, because I like the story and the core fighting mechanics are good.

Edit: To the past and future r–µt–∞rds in the comments: I have a i7, 32GB, 1080Ti. The game crashes on the same places IN THE MENU as the Nintendo Switch version. It's a bug in the game.

Even for someone like me who just button mashes and doesnt try and remember the combos the game is very forgiving in terms of executing moves. Stringing combos together is fun because after playing it for a while you will end up noticing that combos are easy to pull off just by pressing punch twice or kick whatever. The fatalities are super easy to pull off and are very graphic but i love it so much. The detail in this game is the best graphics of all the MK games and going back to the original MK on arcade we thought that was realistic!

39,63118785,english,"Aside from Greedy DLCs this is a very good game. A lot has been fixed among game play mechanics that made the previous 2 MK games frustrating. If you can buy the game with DLC for less than $60 than go for it. I purchased the Premium edition while it was on sale for $35 which came with all DLC characters except Shao Kahn and Frost (Frost can be unlocked for free by playing Story Mode), so It was very worth it for me. However, this is the Greedy aspect of the game. A character like Shao Kahn is in the Story Mode and yet isn't available for playing without extra purchase. Characters like Spawn (who isn't available till March 2020), Joker or Terminator I understand paying a little extra for, but even those are Over priced at $5.99 a character. Which is basically $18 bucks for 3 DLC characters! But $20 extra from the base game gets you 6 characters if you cough up $80 for Premium rather than $60 for standard at regular price. The reason this is so frustrating is because when Mk came out after Netherrealm Studios was purchased by WB, they made a game with a Full Catalog of characters which brought the fans back after their hiatus from almost going broke. And myself and the fans understand these games are expensive to make, but MK characters shouldn't have to be paid for. Characters like Terminator, Spawn and Joker who are outside the story arc are acceptable but at reasonable prices. 

At the end of the day, if you're a fan of MK then this is a game worth adding to your collection. The story is pretty good, they fixed the XRAY meter in combat to only being able to be used once per match and only when your health bar is very low; and the game looks absolutely beautiful.

81,62998393,english,"I recommend this game, flaws and all.

The good:
- The roster is balanced, every character has the tools you need to win
- Character customization is a welcome addition
- Visually, this is a gorgeous game, everything is animated and modeled to be gorgeous
- Mechanically very tight (although it has really fast inputs)
- Base roster is diverse
- Some of the towers are really unique in design, like the Ko-op towers

The in-between:
- The story, you only play as a few protagonists, unlike mk9 where you played as damn near the whole roster
- I miss the wacky fights from mk9's challenge tower

The bad:
- Klassic fighters missing or being added as DLC characters, this really pisses me off.  Ermac, Kenshi, (Cyrax and Sektor are fully modeled and are fought in the story, but can't play as them what the fuckkkk), cyber-sub zero, and reptile are all missing. Nightwolf, Sindel, and Shang Tsung are playable, but only through buying them as DLC, and Shao Kahn is sold separately. This is really lame.

- Tower progress is reset every few hours, meaning if you want cosmetics, you kinda have to do towers in one sitting. I also wish there was an ability to straight up buy non-rare cosmetics.

Overall:
Visuals: 9/10
Gameplay: 9/10
Business practices: 4/10

The good: stunning graphics, superb background design. The bad: everything else. The roster is underwhelming with gaping holes where fan favorites should be. Sure, they added a couple fan favorites, but this roster feels too much like filler so people will buy DLC in the future. The gameplay is SLOW and unresponsive. I feel like no matter how much I practice my character never gets any better. NRS decided to insert political propaganda throughout the game -- they are not subtle about it. I did not appreciate this. I just want to play a game to have fun, not get ""woke"". There are some big bugs in the PC version that need to be ironed out ASAP. Oddly, males can wear armored loin cloths, but females must be covered head-to-toe. That is not equality, that is censoring and shaming females for what they were born as. Lastly, but most important, the horrendous grind scheme to force players to go buy time krystals. Unlocking gear/skins for your fighter is a brutal grind. They claimed a fix was coming, but I have a hunch they are taking their time on that to milk as much $ up front for those who cannot wait for their favorite skins. 3 days after release, I have no interest to keep playing. I am not going to spend years of my life trying to grind in extremely unfair tower fights to maybe, possibly unlock gear I want for my favorite fighter(s). No, thank you. I paid $60 but they still want more, more, more. Greed and politics killed this game for me.

32,62767296,english,"The games good but combos are hard to grasp. Believe me i can barely pull off any combos at this point. This fighting game is more for the competitive scene rather than the casual scene, and if you go online without enough experience your opponent will wipe the floor with you. If you are looking for a more casual fighting game i would try picking up smash bros, dragonball fighterz, or even mortal kombat X.

Secondly, is the graphics. As always netherrealm has put out games that have graphics that match or are better than those of other games at the time, and this is no exception. The characters in this game look amazing and the fatalities and brutalities look gruesome and hyper-realistic, even with the downgrade in gore from mortal kombat x. Not to mention the cutscenes, which also look great

Next, the rumors. Now at the start of this games release it got review-bombed because people said it had too many microtransactions, and you had to grind way too much in the game to get far. Half of this is true, and I will explain why. I personally believe that this game wasn't and is not now microtransaction heavy. If anything, it doesn't have enough. The only microtransaction you can buy are soul fragments, which allow you to buy cosmetics from a shop within the game, not anything that allows you to progress in the krypt. Now about the grinding. While it is true that the grinding at the beginning of the games release was insane, it has gotten much better. Numerous patches have been made so that the krypt would be easier to progress in since the release, and no it is much more simple. But the most important point is that you only have to grind for cosmetics, which do not alter your character in any way that gives you an edge online or while fighting somebody else.

To conclude, I personally really enjoy this game even though it is hard and definitely not for everyone. It mayhave it's faults but those are overshadowed by all of the positive features of the game. For the reasons I have listed so far, I give Mortal Kombat 11 a 8.5/10.",1580524872,1580524872,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198834274293,66,5,5660,0,5660,1580523967,,

Crouch 1 is king in this game? I know it was very common in MKX and it was useful, but it wasn't Godlike like in MK11. Since you made almost every god damn starter a HIGH, just crouching after they whiff or do something unsafe completely removes all risk and potential punish.

Look at Noob, Erron, Scorpion, ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• any character with some of their unsafe moves they throw out, all they need to do is crouch after and they're ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing golden.

Take my main, Skarlet. You do your safe string, ok my turn. 2-1-2, or 1,2,4 OH WAIT, YOU'RE CROUCHING! My highs go right over your head. YOU PUNISH THE ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• OUT OF ME. Lol.. Really?
They throw out something very unsafe, ok I do a quick starter like 2-1-2, OH WAIT THEY'RE ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ING CROUCHING.
Ok fine, I will try a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• punish like the overhead sicle (back-2), oh wait, it takes half a decade to ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing start up, punish. 
2,1,2 and 1,2,4 both suck‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•and make for a stale game. No overhead even though 1,2,4's (2) looks like she swings overhead, but NO, can't give her any mixups whatsoever. Not to mention they are interruptable, 2,1,2 is unsafe on block.. REALLY? A ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing high, mid, mid, one of her ONLY starters (no mixup at all) is punishable on block? Why the F-CK can other characters throw out high low mixes INTO COMBOS and BE SAFE ON BLOCK? 

About as balanced as a square ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing tire on a car.

Why the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• is every move in this game a HIGH? I remember when they did this to my main Mileena in MKX. back 1,2 the go to quick sai pokes, used to be mid then they were high. So now all they had to do was crouch and POOF, scott free.

No wakeups other than a predictable normal that uses bar? good luck getting up and making a comeback if you're in a corner. Even my Parry startup takes a god damn century so there's no point trying to parry when you restand, they will win every time. Fix this.

Is this a fighting game? Where we trade di-ck punches all ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing game? No. Fix this hot trash.

If you like getting really angry at a bad design company who can't balance a game if their lives depended on it, if you like stale same old shit combos over and over since there is little to no creativity in combos unlike MKX, if you like pussy footing around and playing Mortal Kombat at half the speed and twice the annoyance of loligagging and dicking around not getting anything done, buy this game. 

If you're a long time MK fan like me, and you paid the $130 fucking dollars on the deluxe version, first ever pre-order as I had high hopes, only to get a huge slap in the face at a rushed, shitty, unbalanced, sad excuse for MK, welcome to the club.

EDIT: Sure, I'll edit my review. Not much has changed. Greedy, goblin devs have driven people out of this game and possibly the franchise. I have spent hundreds of hours trying to unlock Skarlet's maskless variant. It is the only item of hers I don't have, yet no matter how many billions of gold in the shrine, or hundreds of tag assist towers, it gives me shit ass augments every single time. If you gonna make it RNG lootbox lame shit grind for your life mode, at least take AUGMENTS out of the rolls. Did you guys do this on purpose? I am not the only one who is having hella issues trying to unlock this mask, there are threads about it everywhere.

I have tons of useless currency now, crystals, hearts, souls and even koins. WHY NOT LET US PICK ITEMS AND SPEND CURRENCY ON IT!? I am not the only one who has had it up to here with this garbage.

NRS has killed this game, VERY early into its life. MKX was a big deal for a long time, MK11 if you look at the SteamCharts, has an average of 1,500 players a day, down from ~24,000 since launch. I can hardly find an opponent to play against anymore, and THE JOKER just launched. Sad and dissapointing.

Kombos takes time to grasp to sync with time but its easy if you get on to it. Kombos are difficult but not impossible. I get pretty decent ping of about 100-200 which is playable, above then that my kombos dont work.

Online matches are also fun, there are 2 types of matches, one is Kasual and another is Ranked. Ranked matches are competitive matches where compete to get high rank. Ranked matches are season wise just like pubg, etc where it matches a player according to your rank not the pros who has higher rank.

Probably because I was  really skeptical about buying this game. But, after a few hours I really loved it. I wouldn't have written this review, but I noticed everytime I have some spare time I like to come back to this game for a short session.

Great sound and visuals, there is a technical issue here and there but nothing too serious, just keep in mind if you don't want this to crash and burn, keep the ram at bay, when they said it needs 8GB it really needs 8GB. About the story, it was entretaining, like a movie, not the best, not the worst, but FUN.

As for the grinding, if you are a collector you may suffer, if you want your character to look good everything will be okay after a few hours.

About the controversies... let's say people overreact this days.

Easy to learn, difficult to master. 
This sums up Mortal Kombat 11, which is the latest release from Netherrealm Studios. The game offers a huge amount of content, thrilling fights in great graphical detail. If you have an eye for fighting games, then Mortal Kombat 11 is one of the greatest brawling games of our time. 

[b] The Story [/b]
The game offers a short story. The narrative is very good and even though the story is short, it is great!
‚úóÔ∏é Short story - Gives a view into the lore of the game and establishes background knowledge of who the characters are.
‚úóÔ∏é Some unlockable stuff exclusive to this mode.
‚úóÔ∏é You can set the difficulty to whatever you like.

[b] Klassic Towers [/b]
This is the chill offline single-player dungeon mode for MK11. You can take your time to unlock cosmetics for the characters you like playing. There are different difficulty levels in this mode and completing towers that rewards you with currency, consumables etc. 
‚úóÔ∏é Offline mode, take your time, come back anytime.
‚úóÔ∏é Play the mode in whatever difficulty suits you.
‚úóÔ∏é This is a good way of getting into the next mode in the game, Towers of Time. 
 
[b] Towers Of Time [/b]
This is the ""dungeon"" mode of the game. You can unlock a vast amount of cosmetic items to all characters in the game and currency. Very arcade-ish, I like it.
‚úóÔ∏é Fights with fun modifiers.
‚úóÔ∏é Cool cosmetics.
‚úóÔ∏é Something for everyone, also Coop towers - you can unlock stuff with your friends. 

[b] The Krypt [/b]
This is a massive area involving puzzles and chests you can unlock for different currencies you've earned throughout the game. Take a break from the fighting and visit The Krypt and spend some time by yourself unlocking stuff.
‚úóÔ∏é Best and biggest Krypt Mortal Kombat has ever made.
‚úóÔ∏é Nice puzzles.
‚úóÔ∏é Cosmetics for days.

[b] Online [/b]
You can play PvP in this game, on a casual level or battle in ranked battles. If you're into competing against other players from the real world, this is the place to go to. I personally like playing both casually to train with new characters and then bring them into ranked gameplay.
‚úóÔ∏é If you like online fighting, this is the place for you.

The menu's are locked at 30fps.
The cutscenes are locked at 30fps.
The game cuts you to main menu if you lose internet (I'm writing this review after this has happened, does it look like my internet has gone off?)
The towers don't randomise unless you quit to main menu - so if you want to play towers concurrently with different characters you'll be facing the same set of enemies.

Konsumables are pointless and are an excuse for poor difficulty balances.

The fact that the game has an option to ""simulate online lag"" is pathetic, it was the same in MK9, MK10 and Injustice. LEARN HOW TO CODE A MULTIPLAYER MODE.

I love Mortal Kombat but this game infuriates me. The most money I've spent on a game - and the only pre-order I ever made - in the last 10 years and I'm so dissappointed. I will be thinking long and hard before purchasing any more MK games.

Sometimes the towers can be a little bit tedious.
The online connection of the PC players seems to be like a carrot connect to a 25kbps modem.
You have to play MK 11 on a good machine. Game is tough for a normal pc ou laptop to run smoothly.

Has so much more than just combat, which is a good thing.
I like the character customisation as well, if you dont compare it with another series like injustice 2.
Only issue you may face if you are a casual gamer is that there are less characters in this one.
(But are enough to keep you interested)
The krypt is vast to explore.
You wont regret it if you buy, and could be called best in the series of MK yet.

   As for the game itself? It is really good. The story and the cinematic cut scenes are way batter then the previous games and it shows that a lot of effort and attention to detail has went in to its creation.  

Now that I found the game error was my fault, I can easily recommend this game especially given that it has been hard to put down. 


-- Old Review --

Probably the worst experience with a broken game in the many years I have been on Steam.

View the many topics in the discussions about people crashing and avoid this game at all costs. Save your money.

This game refuses to start with the error:

There are some forum posts here and there complaining about the same error but none of the fixes have worked for me.

1. Great Story Line with the ability to choose different characters to mix it up a bit and alternate story endings although there is a lot of repetiton in the characters fighting themselves in the alternate timeline.

2. Amazing Visuals some of the best I have ever seen and runs very well on a mid to high pc.

3. Has lots of great characters with more to come although the process is slow.

4. online is good with quick queue times and nice rewards for each season.

5. Towers of time which is one of my personal favorite for grinding cosmetics which to some people may feel too grinding but I like it a lot because of the tag assist towers which are great and they are always changing so it mixes it up a bit.

6. Customization is good but not as big as the injustice 2 customization. In mk11 they have 3 gear spots and a skin which on average they have 60 skins per character which is a good amount to continue your grind for all of them.

7.Finally the Krypt which is another way to grind for skins and other kosmetics which I always love. There are a lot of things to unlock in the krypt so it can take a lot of time which is ok if you dont mind grinding for Koins then.


Overall Rating - 9/10 - I like everything about the game but people may get tired of all the grinding but it is great for me.

A lot of the characters look like ""Super Heroes"" and not the MK characters they used to be, which makes them look so damn generic its not even funny. Almost half of the roster has this Scify hero, futuristic style and its just horrible to look at imo, and the roster itself is one of the worst I've seen.

Despite some general bugs on release this time the online is good right "" out of the box"" unlike MKX.

Solid online overall and decently populated a lot better since release than the patched MKX.

Tons of single player content, new online coo op mode, very fun tower of time mode( they fixed it cause on release it was too hard, for the wrong reasons..)

Overall a solid game even to play as a casual single player. 

If you are into competitive as I am, I can say that the game is a lot slower and easier to play than MKX and it relies a lot less on 50/50S, mind you, they are still there and eventually they will piss you off.

Some characters are sjw pleasing crap ugly as sin and annoying to play against or even just to look at, we know who they are.... 

Mechanics like fatal blows are dumb as hell, you know the usual ""comeback mechanic"" that a character can do if they are beaten enough so they can rob you of a win from time to time. To add insult to injury in this game they expire only when they connect, or the next round start, meaning you can use them every 10 seconds, that's how much it takes to recharge them if they Don't connect...

The game has a decent tattical level but it will most likely frustrate you for the reasons stated above and throwns being too strong. 

Solid game overall but ruined to some extent by some stupid modern "" let's help retards"" mechanics, like all the other modern fighting games unfortunately.

+ Character's models and facial expressions are rich in detail.

+ One of the best entries in the franchise features a good amount of features for a single-player.

+ Diverse cast with different gameplay, strength, and weaknesses can lead to a lot of replayability.

+ Story mode cutscenes are beautiful while the story on itself is good and resolves some of its plots.

+ Mercy can make combat online more exciting. The game is easy to pick but hard to master, making it a good entry for newcomers in general.

+ Superb optimization, the game tries to recognize the graphic card and optimize the settings so that you can get the best experience base on your specs.

-Some characters didn't make the cut, and some fan favorites are in as DLC.

- The story could have used some summary so that players who haven't been in touch with the series could catch up with the plot.

- The crypt can struggle to run on some computers depending on the specs, but it is not that bad, the game on itself defaults it to run at 30 fps.

[h1] Introduction [/h1]

Mortal Kombat 11 is the latest entry in the Mortal Kombat franchise. With a revamped system, good variation in characters and more content for the single-player experience is one of the most solid experiences of this year. Crushing blows and fatality look spectacular thanks to the care put into the details of animations and models of the character, highlighting the trademark of gory spectacle that Mortal Kombat is known for. It makes for a strong entry for newcomers and veterans alike.


[h1] Gameplay [/h1]

The combat keeps the traditional formula with the integration of the new elements for the latest entries. Variations are still in the game, and players can customize their own to their liking, tailoring their characters techniques to suit their gameplay better. It is easy to pick up and play since specials are easy to use but hard to master as combos and mechanics require effort and learning. It makes it an ideal title as there is not a barrier to obstruct newcomers. At the same time, it rewards veterans for putting their time into the game.

It also helps with keeping the game fresh as there are always more things to master and that possibility of getting better, improving in the game. Crushing blows and special moves can turn the tide of combat at any time, and they feel very gratifying to pull out. Fatalities are fast and gory, making for swift execution of the opponent.

Customization options are abundant, not only in special moves or variations but also in cosmetics. It gives players more control over their characters with in-depth customization. There are revenant skins along with normal ones as well as more of them. You can personalize the intros, weapons, masks, outfits, moves, taunts, brutalities, and more. Customization on itself is never wrong, and it is good to see that Mortal Kombat wants you to make this your own experience to the best of its ability.

The roster is robust and offers a lot of variety even when some characters didn't make the cut. Some fan favorites such as Baraka, Scorpion, Sub-zero, Raiden, and Sonya Blade are in the base game. In contrast, others such as Sindra, Nightwolf, and Shao Kahn are a feature as DLC. As to the variety, there is a lot of options. Baraka is slow but can deal a lot of damage efficiently. Kabal has easy access to powerful combos. Cassie Cage is a zoner that can control the distance towards her opponent. Sonya Blade has powerful mix-ups that can be hard to defend against, to name a few.

Modes such as the tower of time present an adequate challenge for players to surpass themselves, giving the game even more replayability and features. Klassic tower allows players to explore the characters' endings. AI battles can be a fun diversion to partake in as you change the settings of how you want your AI's to fighting style to be. The krypt has multiple unlockables, and tournament mode is also a mode if you are interested in that.




[h1] Strong points [/h1]

Mortal Kombat 11 is a solid game, and it is overall strong across most of its aspects. It has very few weaknesses as a game, and it is a quality title. Some of the DLC, such as the Terminator, are welcome additions as guest characters. At the same time, combat is shaping to be dynamic and fast. I think the strongest point here is that the gameplay is so good, it is a lot of fun and rewards the time you put into it.

Tutorials for newcomers so that they can better grasp the concept of the game, while the Tower of time and Ranked mode will put their skills to the test once they are ready for them. There is a lot to work toward, and one always wants to unlock more stuff and improve their abilities in the game. The cinematics is enjoyable to watch, both in story mode as well as in fatalities and crushing blows. All of this allows players to continue their Mortal Kombat 11 experience.

[h1] Story [/h1]

The story follows the events of Mortal Kombat X, with Shinnok defeat and Raiden obtaining his amulet. The amulet starts to influence Raiden's thoughts as he becomes more violent and tyrant-like. It leads him into invading Revenant Liu Kang and Kitana castle in a preemptive strike with some earth realm characters to avoid any threat.

They succeed in their mission, leaving the revenants in a vulnerable state and allowing Kronika, an elder god of time, to put a power move and recruit them into her service. With the help of the revenants and other allies, she will set into motion her plan. It is how the story of Mortal Kombat 11 begins.

The story, for the most part, is solid, and it deals with some of the plots of previous games. The focus is center on the collision of past and present, which gives some new interactions of characters. The cinematics is beautiful to the degree that it looks like a movie, and it is an excellent trip to enjoy while exploring the story of the game.

[h1] Some Notes [/h1]

The game runs flawlessly. I tested it on both a GTX 1060 and a GTX 1070, and on both systems, high settings delivered perfect 60 frames while looking fantastic. The only thing that struggles to reach 60 fps what the Krypt mode, but overall it hovered around 40-50 fps for the most part. No crashes to speak of, and the online experience was stable even with opponents who only had yellow bars. 30 Matches in and no lag whatsoever.

The game features some micro-transactions when it comes to cosmetics. While some of them can be earned with in-game currency, most of them are expensive enough that you will need to pay for them. That only refers to some cosmetics. Most of them can be obtained via playing the game whenever that be unlockable in the krypt, received for completing challenges or other tasks. I never felt the need to get one of the pay for those cosmetics in particular.


[h1] Conclusion [/h1]

Mortal Kombat 11 is one of the best entries in the franchise. It is easy to recommend, especially when it is on sale. Deep customization, variety of modes, challenges to test one's skills, ranked modes. It features a learning curve that is easy to get into but hard to master, and this elevates the game's replayability immensely. With its rich details and care put into animations, this game manages to be an excel in most aspects. If you are a fan of the series or like fighting games, get it. If you are interested in getting into it for the first time as a newcomer, do give it a thoughtful look. It is a quality title and an excellent game.

The game is full of glossy sparkles around the MK core. A lot of pink, confetti and bubbles in a game where you tear enemy'spine.
I don't agree with that. Another part, the fact that some characters are the children of other characters. They inherit the idea from MKX (in the game, you perform a fatality to your daughter/father)

see this is just IMO i love mortal kombat, the story and Tutorial are great, 0 crashes only game i have had that dysnced was with a yellow bar fighter. The fps locks aren't a issue they are for fair play, you cant have someone with 144fps vs someone with 60fps. i like klassic towers as well that's cool, but all this time towers and ai battles they suck... i mean who actually cares about them modes..... bring back puzzle mode chess, karts, even mk dc kombo challenges are so much better than this boring grind for koins to spend in the krypt. 
The krypt is terrible the reason they make it look so nice is to try and make up for the fact you spend ages only finding Konsumables to use in the time towers that i already said is boring i don't want to play in them. There is  so much custom stuff but i don't care for any of it..... 1 alt costume is fine. I like ranked straight fights, its dumb to go into player modes and everyone is using different special moves and stuff.... 

The worst part yet is the roster the females designs are terrible, can Jade and Skarlet put on any more cloths in that desert? did some feminist get into the office and rant at ed boon?? sonia is terrible voice acting it sounds even worse next to cassia cages great acting. I also wanted to see some 3d era fighters from mk 4 deadly alliance and deception i mean seen as the other 2 games focused on the first 3, but none only frost and what a poor design of frost it was.

Hackers are in ranked everywhere for example i come across a guy with 30% chance of winning yet he has a good record like 300/60  he has 50 win streak ( go no further he is a hacker) you will own him and in the final round the game discons and the guy dont get his loss...... still no patch for this on console also.......

another glitch IMO people... sorry i correct my self COWARDS can make there pc have LOW FPS if they do that they can sit in ranked and decline anyone they want, like how we can decline anyone with yellow or red bar connection, they can decline anyone they want no matter how good the connection..... so you see so many people with 100/5 but really there just declining everybody apart from total noobs IN RANKED!!!! Bring back the way from MKdc and MK9 with true skill etc you search ranked you get paired with anyone dont like it go in Quick match.

its a shame to see my favourite game franchise change so much. Into a ******* sell out, micro transactions riddle this game. it doesn't seem like a dark and gritty mortal kombat to save the realms, it seems like a colourful comedy version of a mortal kombat.

not to mention someone has worked out it costs over $6400 to get all skins, thats not including the other stuff, intros and winning poses cost more..... in mk x everything was $40

It is not however a Mortal Kombat game. This is so different than the last few MK games that it honestly shouldn't be called one. I have some major issues with the changes to wake ups and a few other things but the real problem is the flow. It just feels bad to play and it doesn't feel rewarding to learn combos or even want you to for that matter.

The game feels like it wants you to do super small strings and that's it. No long combos. No special moves. The optimal way to play is to just do small simple combos. It doesn't want you to go in to training mode and teach yourself a combo. The entire 14 hours I have spent on this I have simply wanted to go play tekken.

68,60740049,english,"Many improvements over MKX, worth a buy especially on sale. Maybe slightly different in pace than X, and in general some changes, but it is still very much Mortal Kombat and improved in many ways. It looks and sounds great, and it just feels great. As the strikes connect you really get a sense of raw combat. Points to the sound and graphics design teams! (TL;DR review at the end!)

The tutorial system deserves an extra honorable mention, and because of the detailed and well designed tutorials, I would say this is the perfect time and title to jump into fighting games with! So if you are a PC only gamer who has been interested in fighting games, but hasn't bought one because it seems like too much work to figure out the mechanics and what exactly is going on, and how to time all the button presses... etc. then Mortal Kombat 11 is perfect for you, mostly because of the excellent tutorial system.

Whether you like Tekken 7 or Mortal Kombat more, this one is worth the money.  If you like Mortal Kombat definitely buy, there are almost zero complaints to be found about the actual gameplay, and even looking at the negative reviews you will find that most are complaining about something that doesn't have anything to do with actually playing the game. Also when you see negative reviews and complaints about the economy of the game, you should know that NetherRealm has done a lot to fix the absurdity with the coins and time crystals and what not. They were intended as a time sink, and they still are, but you progress faster. None of that applies to the actual fighting, which is imo absolutely great. Yes the PC version has a lower player base online than the consoles do, but that's just how it is with fighters (Sure, Tekken 7 has a bit more players than MK11 according to steamcharts), and yes the patches for the PC version are often late because an outside studio handles the PC version, which does suck, but should not be a reason to completely just not buy the game at all if you're interested in it. I did plenty of research before my decision to buy and was really being careful, but now that I did buy it, I couldn't be happier with my purchase!

Also about the Tutorials!
For the first time in any fighting game they have included very detailed tutorials that make the basic mechanics of the game clear, there are aids that make the timing of things like flawless block counters clear, and in general the game provides the best tools i've ever seen for a player to understand why and especially how their timing is off when trying to perform certain things. They've added a UI representation of your controller in tutorials and training which shows you what you should be pressing, and most importantly WHEN, while also showing you what you actually are pressing. We've all been there, thinking were doing everything right but the game just wont do what we're telling it to do! But this time, you get way more help with the timing. New players probably struggle with timing more, not just getting the sequence of button presses right. This time it is very easy to learn combos. The tutorials even help a new or casual player understand things like framedata. and why some attacks are ""safe"" and which are ""unsafe"" and why these matter.

TL;DR: Improvement over MKX, great tutorials make it good jumping point into the fighting game genre.
PC version is fine, there is an active online playerbase, despite Tekken 7 having a slightly larger online community. PC patches come late, that sucks. But, on the very slight chance that we get crossplay with consoles, the versions will have to have parity. (Crossplay might never happen, but they have it with PS4 and XBONE)  As far as the negative reviews: There are no complaints about the gameplay, A very serious majority of the negative reviews here complain about things not related to actual gameplay. So IMO buy if you like Mortal Kombat, or want to get into fighting games and only have a PC just BUY, especially if on sale.",1577527671,1577527671,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197964044869,103,1,5070,0,638,1587546421,,

Tutorials are the best they have ever been in a fighting game till date. Even a beginner can pick it up an get good without looking up online guides.

Towers of Time is a great addition and is where I've spent most of my playtime. While it can be frustrating at times, you will never be stuck at a stage and can use ""konsumables"" to switch up your style. The progression is much better since launch and feels quite rewarding, which is a rare thing these days.

The Krypt is huge step-up from MKX and is a third-person puzzle game of sorts. You can spend the various different types of currencies that you earn here. Don't worry, there's no way to pay for more koins, souls or hearts. The only currency that you can buy are Krystals, which you can only use in the shop. Most things in the shop can be unlocked in-game and all are cosmetic-only. However, the coolest costumes and gear that I unlocked were by playing Towers of Time and in the Krypt. Never did I feel that the game was pushing me to spend money on some exclusive gear. Funny thing is, even if you want to buy a  million koins for the Krypt, you simply can't. The only way to earn koins, souls or hearts is by playing the game. The devs deserve major props to encourage unlocking cool things by playing the game instead of spending money.

The characters are lookin' good, graphics top-notch. Storywise is eh... i guess. I mean i'm not the type to complain so i enjoyed the story. The seasonal pass character that are coming/came are great. Lotsa good mechanics introduced. Kombat League for the competitive players, towers of time for PvErs. Good stuff really. The net-code is actaully really good for a fighter game.. i mean as long as you're not facing some person on a bootleg wifi connection.Characters are fairly balanced which is actually impressive, how do i know that? Well i just followed the top tier tournament players and heard from them so don't bite me for saying that, it's their opinion. I've had the game crash on me couple of times, but a quick file scan usually fixed that. 

Overall.. Yes i recommend Mortal Kombat 11. One of the best Fighter Games on the market with active community and tournaments.

50,60398325,english,"this is a good entry into the series of mortal kombat. has a great story line, and nether realm has recreated a great story since the rebooted with mortal kombat 9 picking up where armageddon left off.

the story mode is good and follows with great character moments and the fights can be challenging, especially when fighting chornika. but it does have its cheesy moments, and i found the end of mkx to be more satisfying.

the towers of time are fun, and it is fun to try unlock so many augments for your character( which augments are jewel pieces you insert into costumes in which you unlock or the defualt ones to change or customize certian ablites), and these are small changes nothing signifcant. a lot the costumes are cool, and they have made it a lot easier to beat the towers since the day of launch in april. i ratherly enjoyed the difficulty when it was launched, but did agree the that difficutly scale was off balance. but after several hours and weeks the towers of time will become a bore, and after you have maybe unlocked all the chest and then having to reseal them all again just to mainly collect tower konsumables.

the tutuorial is the best mortal kombat has ever put out. allowing new comers and vets to really learn every in and out of the game that nether realm has developed. there are also rewards granted to you for completeing character, fight specfic and special training. which is nice to have a goal when just such things.

arcade is the same as always, and is up to you how hard you make it. online has ups and downs, and bc you will come across a lot of the same characters that ppl are fighting with bc they have practiced so much of thier combos to almost infinetly loop moves for maxium damage. this can be annoying to new ppl, and i promise you vets prob get annoyed by it to. so goin online is up you.

The Pros: 
- Great roster 
- Beautiful arenas 
- Good tutorials
- Love the Player variations and customization options
- The graphics! (A given) 
- The story has come a long way and keeps you invested
- The nostalgia. From Kano at the table in the Krypt to Shang Tsung's Model being the original from the 1995 movie, the throw-backs are well received
- A.I. is a cool addition. 

The Cons: (my opinion)
- Rewards should be bigger. I don't mind paying for items, but it takes a long time to earn koins. Each win should grant more hearts and soul fragments 
- Sindel. I love her but they destroyed her story. 
- can't really think of much else as it's been a really great experience so far. 

Would definitely recommend!

95,50373136,english,"As a long time, hardcore MK fan... it pains me to write this review but I'm fed up with the horrible and toxic business practices NRS continue to allow in this damn game. When the game was first revealed, of course expectations were through the roof and when we were fed more and more information it seemed like everything was going great. Then when the big reveal happened and showed us story elements and gameplay.. things started to look a little rough but still pleasing and bright. Near the games release date, some players who had early copies started to talk about how horrible the game was in terms of progression and currency. They would go on to explain how busted and frustrating Towers of Time and the Krypt was. That's when things started to look dark and doubt shrouded everyone. But it never truly hit everyone until the game was released. Oh boy here we go.

[b] Story [/b]
Once again, NRS illustrates that they can't keep a consistent fucking story from their last cliffhangers or teasers. The story was advertised and marketed to be interesting because past iterations of characters would meet with their future selfs and interact accordingly so. It's an extremely interesting concept considering how big the lore is and how much personality is contained within the cast of MK... but the execution is awful. Some interactions have no depth to them, they just happen and are brushed away immediately. Some are just terrible picks and terrible decisions in story making and some don't even happen- some of the most interesting ones for that matter. For example, I personally was looking forward to how Bi-Han (Noob Saibot) would interact with Hanzo (Scorpion) due to their relationship from MK9. Hanzo murdered him and caused him to be stuck in the terrible fate of living as a Wraith. But during the events of MKX Hanzo went through a redemption arc and and established peace with the Lin Kuei and himself. In short terms you could say he's a ""good guy"" now. So wouldn't it be interesting to see Bi-Han enact some type of hatred or vengeance against Hanzo? It would be such an interesting interaction and very ironic if Bi-Han killed Hanzo in the process. But no, that's not what we got, instead D'vorah out of all characters that have no significance in Scorpions character arc or story is the one to take the kill. Why? It's pointless, there's no depth to that death. When Hanzo died I simply just stared at the screen then started to laugh my ass off. It's just embarrassing... As for the entire story? While cinematography and animations are beautiful to look at... the actual writing? It's a mess. It essentially grabs so many elements and stuffs them into a box, shakes them around, then shits it out and hands it to the players. Characters are inconsistent in their decisions and personality, there's no proper continuity from the previous games in the timeline MK9 - MKX and everything that happens in the story gets retconned.  The story is a mess and it does not represent the characters nor give proper justice to them considering how much damn potential is in this future and past interaction type story.

[b] Gameplay [/b]
This is probably the positive light of this damned game. Combat feels extremely smooth, responsive and polished. Landing hits feels really satisfying and putting together strings and special moves is as polished as it's ever been. The game isn't necessarily as ""rushdown"" ""in your face"" close up gameplay style like MKX.. it's mostly neutral based and somewhat similar to MK9 in terms of movement. Krushing blows are new to this game and are essentially moves that give off different properties and higher damage output upon fufilling their conditions. For example, D2 (Down + Y or Triangle) is a normal uppercut. However you can land a ""Krushing Blow"" upon your opponent whiffing a high attack or trying to grab you. Once they miss their chance you press D2 and you'll land Krushing Blow. Not only will you receive more of a reward from reading the opponent correctly by damage, it'll also lead them up in to the air to allow for more conversions and damage. It's actually an interesting concept in gameplay since it allows players to make correct reads and get more of a reward for it. I actually quite like it. However even this has it share fair of problems. Everyone has 2 universal krushing blows. A D2 (Uppercut) and a Throw krushing blow. The rest are unique to the character whether it be from their strings or their special moves. The problem here is that some characters don't have to do much to land a krushing blow while others have to break their fucking neck just to receive a sniff of a krushing blow. For example Geras can land a krushing blow by using his quicksand when the opponent is in a counter or punish state, essentially when they're vulnerable. It's extremely easy to land this considering the range his quicksand covers. Characters like Johnny have absurd conditions for Krushing Blows. He has on where you have to either land the first hit in the match, or after landing extended mime time twice. If you'd just sit down and look at the conditions for all the characters across the board you'd see that some characters have it way easier compared to others. Now the game was also advertised to be ""customizable"" in the characters abilities somewhat changing their playstyle. For example a player could play as a Jade who zones with all of the projectile abilities or a Jade that rushes down opponents with her pole vault and pole vault cancel and vanishing winds. I'm here to reassure you that this component of the game is actually nice as well. There's just one little problem. Imagine coming up with the perfect setup that matches your playstyle for said character. You're comfortable with those moves and you've grown accustomed to them. Then.. you go on ranked and realize that your abilities that you set for yourself aren't there. This is because you can't use your custom variations in RANKED. Ho- wHY- WHY? That completely takes out the experimentation from learning a character. You can't use the moves you've grown accustomed to in a ranked match?

[b] Graphics [/b] 
The art direction for this game is pleasing to look at in my opinion. It doesn't exactly hold up to phenomenal designs we had in MKX but that colors and color palettes are brighter here. MK11 has alot of color scheming which is pleasant to the eye considering MKX looked really washed out of color at times. Like I said before the cinematography in the game is beautiful and animations are great to look at. Game definitely has a beautiful graphical presentation.

[b] Soundtrack [/b] 
The soundtrack is really appealing. It's nothing too crazy but there are a couple tunes stuck in my head like the tournament stage and the main menu theme. MK has always had a decent to amazing soundtracks with catchy tunes to accompany the unique stages. Same follows here.

[b] Difficulty [/b]
Compared to MKX, (which was already something anyone could get into in my honest opinion) MK11 is not a hard game to get into. I believe anyone can get into this game casually or competitively if they want to. It actually has a proper tutorial that explains the fundamentals of not only MK but a fighting game in general and that is a big plus in my book.

[b] DLC Handling and Crappy Business Practices [/b]
It's a mess. Even when you purchase the kombat pack you aren't guaranteed some things that SHOULD be in it such as the Female Klassic Costumes. YOU HAVE TO BUY THOSE SEPARATELY IN BUNDLES WITH IN GAME CURRENCY. To keep it short and explain how much of a mess this is.. When the game was first released there were nothing but complaints about how difficult the AI was and how terrible the progression in currency was in the game. The game contains rng limited timed items both in the premium shop and ToT.

[h1] TL;DR [/h1]
Frustrating elements in game design and story that shrouds the combat and minimal amount of good in the game. Stay away.

[h1] version for people who can actually read [/h1]

eight months since launch, still a nightmare experience online. and yes, of course i ignore singleplayer content for this review, it's a fighting game. it's made for multiplayer, otherwise they would hire professionals to write actual screenplays for the story mode. so, for all the morons immediately crying about rank, experience and tiers of play: it's not about that. i usually play around god/elder god rank, but the rank system is just a grindy joke anyway. so being high rank doesn't even mean sh*t. now, let's get to the point...

[u] awful performance [/u]

[list]
[*] 1/3 games desync due to netcode itself.
[*] wifi warriors can't be declined, even in ranked play.
[*] insane lag spikes with people from other continents. wtf, just implement regions, NRS.
[/list]

[u] core design issues [/u]

[list]
[*] tons of stuff becomes unreactable online, toppling the balance of many moves - and characters, naturally.
[*] zoning. they removed running to finally establish some neutral game, but failed to adjust the projectile game. NRS literally want fullscreen spam to be a viable strategy on top level, as you can see with players like Dragon. sure, you learn to handle it, but it takes the fight out of the fighting game and simply ruins the fun. i don't want to chase a moron down the stage until i can finally play footsies with him, just to be put in a mixup situation on oki myself and start all over again to the other side. it's just boring af, and most zoners don't even suffer disadvantages up close. cetrion, for example, has one of the best poke options in the game. i don't mind true zoners, but more than half of the cast can be effectively played as zoners. nearly everyone has a projectile, many have different projectiles, high-low mixups and other bullsh*t. even if you are better at playing the spam game, people don't adjust. i have played so many people who rather sit and eat a 0:2 than approaching the opponent once.
[*] fuzzy guarding is a meme due to server performance.
[*] getup options. do i need to say more?

72,59842322,english,"The game's at a point where it only crashes. Also Boss towers are so incredibly inconsistent. A boss meant to be fought with 3 people, but you attempt it with 2 people will be a walk in the park and the next meant for 2 people will obliterate you. Game really needs to quit randomly overpowering these people and underpowering others, and the barrage of stage modifiers gets really annoying.

The modifiers you have are nothing but a waste if the game just keeps crashing, so using them is the same as deleting them.

Fighters are not balanced. There's a reason you see so many Noob Saibots and Scorpions everywhere.

And obviously, go ahead and compare the ladies from MK9 to this game. Notice anything glaring and blatantly obvious? Subtlety is not NRS's strong suit. The guys get more naked and the girls get more layers of clothes with each release now, and reasons given for this are wide-open lies. That becomes apparent when you see Kano take a p!ss on the ground and then tell Skarlet to ""try his sausage"". May not affect gameplay but it tells you what the new agenda points to. Yet more SJW conformity, as if there wasn't already enough of that.

Then the endless grind of the Krypt just seems to be eternal. You can sometimes buy the stuff you'd find there in the Store, but you need crystals to do that and you stop getting those after a while. Only cash can get them after a certain point, so it's clear where WB's priorities have fallen.

No Mileena, No Reptile, no Ermac, no Goro, tons of older cast just gone, Sheeva is a man, Sindel is unrecognizable, Sonya has no set personality, look, voice or style, just a different person in every game, Jax is a emo puss!e, discount Sin√©ad O'Connor is the end boss, no familiar outfits, tons of DLC, Ed Boone and that annoying tool Steve Beran don't respect the fans at all... no way I am recommending this. I literally play MK Mobile 3 times more cuz it has all the stuff this game is missing and more. I recommend MK9 if you don't already have it.

I do not mind the desexualization of the characters, but I find it a shame that there is double standards where the male characters are still overly sexualized (It's eighter all okay, or none of it is in my eyes).

It's a outstanding game, great graphics and fairly good story. However, it is sadly a game covered in some Kontroversies.

There are so many hints and nods to previous MK Games and a lot of the time it feels like MK11 is a love letter to MK fans and its history. The Krypt is simply amazing with its unique design and has a mini game feeling to it. I was surprised when I entered to Krypt for the first time to find Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa has reprise his role as Shang Tsung and that really warms my heart since I love the original movie. The story mode is awesome as always and there are many different towers you can complete to earn in game currency to use to unlock chests in the Krypt. Yes there are micro transactions but I haven't found it to be a problem yet since you can earn all the rewards yourself but have the option to buy if you want to skip the grind. The grind is what seems to have upset most people but NetheRealm is busy rebalancing the in game currency and how quickly you can earn the rewards. Micro transaction are completely optional and doesn't affect the game. Lastly is the character customisation which is fun and adds another layer of depth to the game. It's cool to unlock new items, change up the move sets to truly make the character your own. This is one of the best MK games ever made and it saddens me to see it review bombed like this because it doesn't deserve it and it is this kind of overreaction that is chasing publishers to Epic.

Regardless of my settings the games performance remains terrible despite showing a fps of 60.

On the brightside online is free which is why I went for the steam version.

I can't even practice offline. I guess they really want to sell us stuff I have no interest in. I like fighting games for the action not dress up.

With over 600 hours on MK X and countless hours on the past games, this mortal kombat is not worth the problems OR price they are charging for it.

All in all, 5/10. Only reason its getting a 5 is because the game looked great when i actually got to try it/play it. Highly would recommend buying mortal kombat X, not 11.

92,59130630,english,"I have thoroughly enjoyed this game and do not regret any hours of which i have put in however there are a multitude of both disappointing and also immensely enjoyable elements to this title.
Cons:
.Footsies is... strange, while not non-existent judging from character match up it can either be heavily footsy based or due to many chase downs or long reaching attacks practically useless (baraka's b2 or scarlet's entire moveset for example)
.Very limited character pool without DLC, also missing many fan favourites (Mileena, Reptile, Goro whom is dead, Ermac etc. obviously not everyone should be included but it feels like core characters are not included whilst characters no one cares about are, Kollector,Frost and Devorah for example) this comes down to personal preference but im not happy with the selection of the roster
.Most costumes are simple base colour changes of other costumes, there are probably only 8-10 original costumes for each character out of 50'ish
.Towers of time becomes an essential mode in order to earn coins and purchase costumes, collectables etc. however it can be absurdly difficult and also just kinda boring (once again personal preference)
Pros:
now after listing all the cons i shall list the pros, i did enjoy this game and thing it is more of a positive then a negative
.While character pool is limited the iconic characters that were included (scorpion, subzero, baraka, liu kang, jade, kitana etc.)were done perfectly with their respective looks and move sets matching what i believe to be the most important aspects of each character
.Pace of the game is really fun
.Graphics are top notch, looks amazing and sounds great as well, every crunch and impact feels genuine
.Fatalities as always are over the top brutal... and i love it! watching the opponent be degraded after being the victor is rewarding as ever
.Community engagement and developer listening to feedback has been good, and any mistake has been addressed quickly with a sincere apology on their behalf

42,50386854,english,"It‚Äôs still early days of the game, but so far I have been impressed by the gameplay MK11 brings to the table. It brings forward a range of fighters, all bar 3 of them returning from previous games, catering for a diverse range of fighting styles. I have also enjoyed the story so far.

My main issues would be the following:
- most modes revolve around being online (probably only a problem if you are like me and play on my laptop on-the-go). You can still access single fights, practice and story mode, however you won‚Äôt receive much in the way of rewards until you reconnect to the internet
- some of the currencies require a bit of grinding to obtain, making gaining new gear more tedious. It‚Äôs not too bad though

Finally, I would like to address the Frost hatred within other reviews of the game. Frost was announced as part of the main roster and is not listed online as one of the DLC characters, and as such is unlockable within the main game despite being locked to start. Unless you really don‚Äôt want to play the story, there isn‚Äôt a reason to pay to play as Frost (although other negative reviews really overreacted over this)

Update: Game is still good

Not gonna spoil the roster, but I think what they have planned gives series fans a lot of credit while also catering for pop culture lovers.

As for the game itself, having played more of it since my review first came out, have discovered the finer complexities of the game, including the puzzling nature of the Krypt and the customisation system.

I‚Äôm particular I want to highlight that last part. Customisation is a key feature of this game, such that you play as your personalised version of a character, rather than using some preset version.

73,54082478,english,"This latest entry is one of the best fighter games you could play, but its encouragement to grind is what kills your ‚Äúfighter spirit,‚Äù thanks to the influence of a cash-grabbing publisher like Warner Bros.

What makes [i]MK11[/i] special from [i]MKXL[/i] is its pacing and the change in its mechanics.

[i]MK11[/i] is slow-paced. The field of view is smaller, and the characters are put closer to each other, giving the gameplay a more tense feeling during Kombat.

[h1]Kombat & Strategy[/h1]
Out-pokes, juggling, and zoning are given special attention for connecting Kombos and Special Moves together. They‚Äôve even given tutorials on them.

Environmental hazards also make a return, some of them being Krushing Blows, grabs, or knockdowns.

Blocking an opponent at the nick of time is now a [b]Flawless Block.[/b] The player will have a fraction of time to retaliate and deal damage to the opponent.

The vanilla version of the game has 24 characters. Each character is different from one another, and their playstyles are easy to follow. It‚Äôs almost like Rock-Paper-Scissors. Zoners would love Skarlet and Cetrion while Close Quarter fighters would love Jax and Kung Lao.

The game design is friendly to new players, too. The learning curve only begins to get steeper once you are an intermediate with a character, but until then, you don‚Äôt need to be good at fighting games to get good quick (provided you practice), which is outstanding. But this is also dependent on‚Ä¶

[h1]Variations[/h1]
By default, every character would have 2 preset variations. But you also have full control over customizing variations for your character. 3 Special Move slots are given, and a list of Special Moves to choose from. Most of the Special Moves may take up 1 slot (some take 2).

With this concept applied on all 24 characters, you are giving yourself TONS of gameplay. Every match you play can be a fresh experience if you mix and match. You can store up to 5 variations for each character.

 [h1]Enhancement System[/h1]
[b]Enhancements[/b] have been redesigned; it‚Äôs been divided into two parts: 

[b]Offensive Enhancers[/b], which can buff your special moves, and [b]Defensive Enhancers[/b], which can help you with Getup Attacks, Breakaways, and Rolls. 

Each Enhancer has two bars, with a total of 4 bars to use. The X-Rays are now disconnected and have been overhauled in the form of‚Ä¶

[h1]Fatal Blows & Krushing Blows[/h1]
[b]Fatal Blows[/b] can only be executed when your health reaches 30%. Once you use it, you can‚Äôt use it again throughout the match. If it gets blocked, you don‚Äôt lose it, but it takes time for it to recharge. This is a potentially game-changing mechanic, eliminates redundancy, and involves risk and strategy, something the previous games lacked.

The same concept is also applied during Kombos; when you execute your attacks, if certain conditions are met, then it deals a [b]Krushing Blow[/b], which deals an incredible amount of damage, but not as much as Fatal Blows.

[h1]Cosmetics[/h1]
An acquired feature from [i]Injustice 2,[/i] the [b]Gear System[/b] lets you outfit your characters with items that can hold augments to help boost your stats in Kombat.

[h1]AI System[/h1]
Your characters have AI components as well. It‚Äôs been divided into 5 behaviours. Customizing and experimenting with them can be useful if you want to farm Towers, or compete against other players‚Äô AI team in the [b]AI Battle[/b] mode.

[h1]Visuals & Music[/h1]
Colour palette is richer, the characters are more proportionate and believable, the animations are a whole lot smoother, and each fighting stage is different and helps build on the game‚Äôs lore.

There are some instances when the spurting of blood just feels like the asset is being scaled to a larger size (Baraka‚Äôs Fatality), but that‚Äôs ignorable. The UI is smooth and easy to navigate, but it can make you feel like you‚Äôre playing a card/mobile game.

The music is pretty great, but one of the stages has a problem of echo-like/muffled sounds. Hopefully they fix that issue.

[h1]Story[/h1]
Call it a pretty typical ribbon tied around the franchise to establish closure. Some of the characters were pretty useless. They could‚Äôve just used Tremor in place of that Poison Ivy rip-off they call Cetrion, expanded on Triborg in the Cyber Lin Kuei segments with Frost, not introduce Kollector at all, and not tried too hard with D‚ÄôVorah. I‚Äôm glad they expanded on characters like Jade, and Baraka, who were mostly presented as one-sided characters, but now have much more narrative depth. The MacGuffin moment in the game just makes you want to roll your eyes but at least it wasn‚Äôt as bad as the one in [i]MKXL[/i].

So, it was okay. But the next time, they need to hire better voice actors. Ronda ‚ÄúText-to-Speech‚Äù Rousey was horrible.

[h1]The Krypt [/h1]
[b]The Krypt[/b] is back. Same old stuff, you go around and unlock chests to collect and/or make new items/augments using different currencies.

There are 3 types of in-game currencies: Koins, Soul Fragments, and Hearts. Koins and Fragments are easier to attain while Hearts are, well, not (getting 15 is work enough).

The infamous Naknadan Shrine has you gambling X number of Koins for random drops of augments/items, so your 75K donation can result in a drop worth just 10. Even worse, it‚Äôs been confirmed by one of the WB dudes that the Shrine will only award you augments after excess use. So your only luck to get your wishlisted item at that point is to keep opening chests. This is where things go completely wrong.

You see, there are almost 10 major zones in the Krypt, with each zone having tons of chests. Each chest‚Äôs price ranges between 2.5k Koins to 50K Koins, special chests between 100-250 Hearts and Soul chests between 100-2K Fragments. You use Kronika‚Äôs Time Vault to refill opened chests so you could unlock them again. Depending on how many chests you want to refill, you‚Äôll want to ready your kidneys. The refilled chests would have to be opened with your currency again.

All this excludes the Shrine. Forging items takes [i]both[/i] your Koins and Fragments as well. You would have to play through a lot of Towers in order to build up an okay chunk of either of the three.

In short, you would have to grind harder than a nympho to get a cosmetic you are vehemently hunting.

[h1]Performance[/h1]
The Krypt was a nightmare to deal with previously, but now it's a lot better, framerate-wise. I haven't taken a proper look at the performance since the previous updates, but the performance has indeed greatly improved.

[h1]Verdict[/h1]
This is far from a Flawless Victory. There are two major problems I see with this game now: The loot system, and the business model.

It is not just unsatisfactory, but it is horrendous torture to make the player break their butts off only to bet all their rewards on drops based on (programmed) luck. This problem could‚Äôve been solved if we were allowed to forge the item we are hunting anytime. So the player would have the choice to either get it by luck, or by sheer work. The inconsistency is maddening. Many instances in the game even encourage grinding!

They tried to circumvent this using the Towers of Time, but that only adds to the concept of grinding.

Frost is a character you can unlock after you finish Chapter 4 of the story mode, and yet they put her up as paid DLC. The Kombat Pass does not include Shao Kahn, or the recently released Halloween skin pack,  which can feel pretty unfair for some. This is shady.

And one of the highlighted problems of all their previous games makes a return: [b]horrible hitboxes![/b] I cannot stress just how messed up it is. [i]FIX THEM, PLEASE![/i]

I love the game. It‚Äôs clear that NRS wanted to give something special to the fans. But it‚Äôs despicable how WB is using bad design practices to gain profit out of the players. If I could give it a mixed review, I would, but I can‚Äôt. So I‚Äôm giving it a thumbs down to help highlight these issues.",1563060441,1575230160,False,23,2,0.665407955646514893,2,True,False,False,76561198018243990,791,67,26375,593,5394,1602062080,,

Mortal Kombat 11 for me was a literal game changer in this regard.

41,52929538,english,"[b] Is MK11 a good MK game? Yes. A good fighting game? Also yes. [u] But not without issues. [/u] [/b] Grind is still there, even though it is much bearable then the release week. Monitization makes no sense, you can buy 5 items per 8hours or a day (forgot already), which are completely random. Which can lead to you having nothing new there to buy, or stuff you already have unlocked. And most of it is obtainable through gameplay, but can require hours upon hours to get. Should it be reworked even more? Yes. How? Well, me personally, I would make much more skins obtainable via proper gameplay (bot ladders, i'm looking at you) and in shorter time span, certainly not through some ""shop"" with currency that is bought with real money.
Gameplay wise I personally think it's a much clearer version of previous two games, it's not as slow as MK9, not as crazily fast as MKX, feels more streamlined and polished in many regards (outside unlockables). Fatal blows (previously known as x-rays) are more akin now to Tekken 7 rage arts, which become available at low HP for comebacks. Definetely can be at times viewed as cheap moves, but in high tiers of competition they certainly increase the tension factor for viewers and players, and pros certainly aren't easy prey for random presses of this move, it requires some strategy that can be cheap with new players, but not so much in pro/high level competition (there are exceptions of course). New krushing blows mechanic is a nice addition, but it lacks balancing severly: current top-tier characters are up there in tier-lists for many reasons, and one of this reasons is this new mechanic, which in some characters is just plain better then in others. Some of the low-tier chars have insane requirements of achieving said krushing blows, which leads to them being completely ignored for their impracticality. On the other hand, top-tiers get much more plausible to achieve krushing blows, which require something that WILL MOST DEFINETLY HAPPEN during a match, for example, a counter hit or a punish. NRS plz fix. 
Meter is now split into two and constantly recharging, I think in the end it's the right decision. Now the losing side isn't that punished in terms of  stuff they can do (winning side now has no meter advantage), which makes meter-economy actually more strategic, e. g. should I endure whole combo punish with a juggle, or should I use breakaway now, which will make me vulnerable to such punishes if I fail to establish good offence and/or defence? Or should I use my defensive bar for new getups? It's certainly encouraged to use offensive meters very often, but also you should think about it, because now you don't build it up for getting specials out and pressuring your opponent, it's gonna refill in a span of time. Which leaves you, if you spend 2 bars, completely meterless. Meaning your offensive actions should now be more carefully thought out. Meaning you really should think 2 bars at once or maybe I should spare one meter for situational usage? It's a whole new metagame/mindgame. 
Character roster... Well, it's definetly not bad, but current roster feels a bit lacking, certainly with more kombat packs it will start to emerge as more complete. Not all ninjas are present, not all recent addition (MKX) characters are there. Hopefully will get all ninjas someday, maybe even MKX Takeda and Kung Jin... But as it seems it won't be too soon. First combat pack looking good, Shang is pretty dope, hopefully other characters will be at least as good as Shang Tsung balance-wise (UPD:they're pretty dope aswell). 
Storymode was cheasy at times, but it's the best one they had in 3 new MK games. It's a step-up in terms of overall quality. Not too long, not too short. Has some replayability: at certain points you can choose your character before a fight, which can lead to new stuff happening, but don't expect to have completely branching story. 
Performance wise I had no issues on very high to high settings on my R7 1700@3.65Ghz, R9 290. 30FPS limit unlock works absolutely fine with this setup. Had no major problems, no crashes, bugs. Stable 60 even in storymode.

74,58499172,english,"Hey everyone, just a heads up, my review is based on my being a casual player. I‚Äôll play a few rounds, take a break and return to the game later. I don‚Äôt participate in online play as per some of the mixed reviews I‚Äôve read, nor am I a heavy grinder player where I go for hours on end. Where this game normally retails for a Premium Package at $89.99, I did a black friday $44.95 Premium Package sale and I‚Äôm quite happy with my purchase. Also, I‚Äôve been a fan of the series since MK1, and have gone through the various console editions of MK 2, 3, 4 all the way to the PC version of MK XL. If you‚Äôre a casual player like me and a fan of the series, you‚Äôll be more than satisfied acquiring this game and find yourself in the clouds of MK heaven.

I‚Äôm running this game on a core i7 4770 PC, with 20gb of Ram, and after trying various un-installable video cards, such as the GTX 1050ti and the GTX 960, I‚Äôm running what may be an unofficial - unclassified Nvidia GTX 750 4gb video card. (GTX 750 is normally a 2gb card, but mine uses the same chipset as the 2gb only in a 4gb video memory version). The graphics are definitely over the top, just stay away from using higher anisotropic settings as the game may get choppy.

There's some new game changes. From MK X/XL, the X-ray mode is now called Fatal Blow which lights up/becomes available towards the end of the round. Also, each character at the moment comes with 2 fatalities, one of which is locked and gets unlocked supposedly through the Krypt search, however..... through internet searches for fatality 2, performing the locked fatality in combat gets unlocked so it can viewed later on in the character moves list, thus avoiding unnecessary grinding in the Krypt. 2nd fatalities can also be unlocked through fatality training as well. 

Next‚Ä¶..*DO NOT* purchase Frost. Play story mode and get past chapter 4 and she will unlock.

DRAWBACK‚Ä¶..there‚Äôs no Joker or Spawn characters at this time. It is rumored that Fujin and Sheeva are in the works for DLC and to be honest, I‚Äôd rather see them playable in the series over Joker and Spawn, just my opinion.",1574986606,1575078887,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198275156715,12,2,4055,0,681,1597275091,,

I love the animations, the new fighting mechanics, the variety of content included, the fact that the game has all characters unlocked from start (pay attention SFV), a big plethora of skins that are unlockables or prizes for events or even can be bought with game money or real one, I love the characters included, love the locations, some special event towers are really unique like coop towers.

Cons: Some story moments are weak, still it is a much better version of previous ones, The game is still being polished and balanced, there will be always a character you want to be included and missed, there is no tag battle for multiplayer (there is a similar mode in the towers).

80,58435249,english,"MK11 for me is a mixed bag. This is of course my personal feelings toward the game,so please understand that before reading my review. I am a longtime fan of the Mortal Kombat series,ever since it's original release in 1992. That being said,I have my favorite MK games and not-so favorite MK games. But,right now we are focusing on Mortal Kombat 11. To make this review as simple as possible,I'll list my positives and negatives about MK11,and then give my personal reason why.....here we go

Positives:

-Amazing Graphics and Animations

( I love how NRS has motion scanned each character's face over a real person. This makes MK look real again [a la MK1-MK Trilogy] Unlike,it's previous predecessors from 1997-2015. The facial animations are fantastic!

-Great New Fatalities and Brutalities

(Mortal Kombat and the guys over at NRS have once again,outdone themselves by bringing us MK fans more gore filled,blood-soaked,gruesome Fatalities and Brutalities)

-Outstanding Soundtrack

(The music in this game is some of the best from the MK series by far. Just listen to Scorpion's Shirai Ryu Fire Garden stage! God bless the legend himself,Dan Fordan for bringing us another amazing MK soundtrack)

-Roster

(MK11 brings back a ton of fan favorites,a couple of obscure characters and a few new fighters. That was a grip of mine from MKX. There were way too many new characters in MKX,which mostly sucked. So,bringing back characters like Baraka,Skarlet,Jade,Kabal and Frost,was a real treat indeed!)

Negatives:

-Required Server (Online) Connection

(This may be a nit pick for some,especially since it seems like mostly everyone has an online or Wi-Fi connection within their household,but there are still some people out there [including myself] who don't have the greatest of online connection or doesn't even have an internet connection at all. This is a BIG problem! Considering the fact that you HAVE to be connected to NRS' online servers constantly,to be able to even access the krypt,towers of time or even save your unlocked gear pieces,time crystals,soul fragments,hearts or koins,while playing offline. This is just completely unacceptable! Especially considering that Injustice 2's Multiverse,was available both online AND offline. You could also save your gear pieces,skins,currency and source crystals offline as well. Even though,the Towers of Time are timed events,so was the Multiverse in ""Injustice 2"". Even the Krypt was accessible in MKX without an online connection! This is just uncalled for! Only playable modes you have in offline for MK11 are,single fights,practice,story mode,klassic towers [traditional standard MK arcade ladders],training and Fatality practice. You'll acquire absolutely NO type of in-game currency while offline,whatsoever! This hurts MK11 in a HUGE WAY!)",1574958128,1574958128,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198965273530,14,3,535,0,467,1582279887,,

11,50356932,english,"I've always been a big fan of the Mortal Kombat series.  I remember when I was a young boy, when it felt dirty and wrong playing it.  The gruesomeness of it all was unlike anything I had ever seen before, and even though it kind of freaked me out...  I loved it!

There is a lot more competition on the market now, at least as compared to when I was growing up.  Because of that the brutality doesn't stand out quite as much...  But it still does capture that old grossed out and excited feeling.  The attention to detail on the gore and fatalities is a lot of fun, and I can't think of another game that can really compete.

That being said, I don't really like the fatalities as much as I did in the past.  While the organs and gross stuff is super high res, it all just feels a little more...  Artificial?  Obviously it's not real, but I think the execution isn't as nice. (Pun intended.)

Speaking of high res, the characters in this game are gorgeous.  I found myself going through their different models and getting excited about all of the little details!  Unlocking new skins is kind of annoying, and where most of them are just recolors it's kind of...  Annoying?  But overall, from an objective take on it, the models are really beautiful.

Gameplay wise, MK11 is a super solid port.  I don't have any of the problems I've seen in other fighting games, and the game feels nice and clean.  Combat is also super fun, with room for both novice and more competitive players to find comfort in their own niche.

Going back to what I said about unlocking things, though...  Somebody kill me now.  The grind is ridiculous.  And the cash shop stuff is ridiculous.  If we're spending as much as this game costs, we shouldn't be charged an extra fiver for a skin.  Like, really?  Ripoff.

They also didn't originally mention on the Frost DLC that you could unlock her in the storyline, so that's another little chunk of money that a bunch of people ended up paying when they didn't have to.  The description was changed, but there were no refunds, that's pretty messed up.  I get that it might have been an oversight, and the DLC is for competitive players that don't want to play the storyline... But take some responsibility, guys.  Seriously.

There are a bunch of people complaining about how bad the Tower of Time and Crypt grinds are, but the dev team said they're working on a patch for the first.  And honestly I've really enjoyed the Crypt so far.  It's like a big puzzle full of lots of easter eggs and treats.  But...  Good luck getting what you want.  Opening a chest that you had to perform 250 fatalities for, and getting concept art and a mask for somebody you don't even use........  Ugh.  Extremely annoying and unsatisfying.


Pros
+Gorgeous graphics
+Exciting story
+Incredible character design
+Gory and unsettling, just as it should be
+Flawless port
+Devs are making changes based on player feedback

Cons
-Ridiculous business model
-Absolutely terrible grind
-250 fatalities, hoping for a skin or fatality...  Get concept art
-Good keyboard controls, and great gamepad controls

tl;dr
If you love the series and have the money, go for it.  If you're on the fence, get it on sale.  It's really fun and super cool to look at.  Totally worth a play!  But they're going to take your money and then ask for more.  Also some characters have hot bodies but ugly faces.

65,54976477,english,"I have really enjoyed this game.  I assumed I would before I even purchased it because, well, it's Mortal Kombat.

I'll start with the Pros:
-Fresh new take on offensive/defensive meters (not like any other fighting game).  This system actually works very well and lets you develop a good resource management skill.
-Solid roster of characters you love and know (RIP Mileena), but also some very interesting new characters and refreshed less popular characters from previous games.
-A pretty decent balance (no game is perfect, of course).  They've done alright with the balance so far; issued balance patches, etc.
-The Krypt (visually) is really nice.  Has a good immersive feeling and exploration early on in your gameplay.
-The graphics overall are really nice as well.  I love how detailed the faces are.  They have a lot or realism to them that feels great in a fighting game.  Along with the faces, the maps also look really nice; lots of detail and creativity.  
-There are a lot of customizations.  They really amped this up compared to previous games.  There are so many skins and gear items to really make your characters unique and custom to you.  Along with the cosmetic customizations, there are plenty of ability customizations as well.  Every character has an extensive list of slot-able abilities.  Not all tournament usable, but still very fun and nice to have.  All can be earned in gameplay rather than through micro transactions.   
-A new pace to the gameplay-- The fighting ""flow"" feels slower/calmer than in the previous (MKX).  The combo strings feel shorter and simpler than previous games.  You really feel the footsies strong in this one.  I'm no pro by any means, but I think the flow feels fresh and fun.  
-The story mode is really great.  Has an engaging story line with incredible graphics.  Wasn't too long, but wasn't too short either.   
-Farming towers can be done with your own AI character.  This is a nice feature to eliminate some of the grind, but this wouldn't really be a needed feature if it weren't for a specific tedious game mode (towers of time)... but I'll get into that in the cons.

So now on to the cons:
-One of the biggest cons, in my opinion, are the toxic towers of time.  I cannot properly express how much I dislike this mode.  Towers are classic to the MK franchise, and I generally enjoy doing towers.... but the konsumable system in the towers of time is just the worst (unless you let your AI fighter do it all for you).  I have never had fun playing through the towers of time with modifiers on them.  They're annoying and don't challenge me in the way I want to be challenged in a fighting game.  Konsumables/modifiers should be an ""opt in/just for fun"" game mode you play with your friends when you're bored and want to mix it up. I know what you're thinking, ""why don't you just not play that game mode?"".  Unfortunately most of the cosmetics are locked behind these towers, so you feel you need to play them.  The only plus to the game mode is the ability to set your character to AI, and they'll do the towers for you.  Useful and necessary,  but super boring and not what I want in a fighting game.
-Farming the Krypt is so tedious and boring.  Opening chests in the krypt is no strange concept to MK.  It's just a grind for gear and items you want...but a lot of the time you just get konsumables for towers...blah.  Doesn't feel all that rewarding.  Once you reached the point where you have unlocked a good portion of the cosmetic items, then it's all about the Shrine....
-The Shrine is the endgame for getting customizations. This is basically a loot box masked as a shrine.  But let's be honest, it's just a slot machine:  You put in a large amount of Koin, and pull the lever for some ""fun"" RNG. This is really an exhausted mechanic that developers love to put in games that you pay full retail price for.  I'd understand if it was a free to play, but ugh to the whole RNG lever.  I reject this mechanic. 
-Sometimes the game is laggy even when playing against bots.  The PVE lags specifically when you're facing team up opponents, or endurance matches.  No one likes lag, so enough said there. 

Now of course there are some unmentioned pros and cons, but this has already gone on long enough. 

TLDR:  MK 11 is good old MK.  A ""continuous fun"" fighting game.  They brought new things that keeps it fresh while keeping things that are Klassic to the franchise.  Main downside, like so many others, is the grind for items.  I'd still recommend MK11 to anyone who likes fighting games.  It's fun and I've put in a lot of gameplay time, there will be many more hours going forth.

91,50310054,english,"The best and most fresh MK to date.

I'm a big fan of story of MK, and this game is the most cinematic yet, along with tons of well written moments and characters that just keep getting fleshed out. Its especially good if you're a fan of this current trilogy.

The game-play feels like its at its finest, characters usually excel in close range/mid-range/zoning/ and mix-ups. With a good amount of most of those categories the combat feels pretty varied and gives you many different play styles. 

The crushing blow system is the evolution of mortal kombat action. Small cinematic sequences that are also essentially 1-time mini super movies that usually requires forethought to execute. Since you can only use them once a match they are viewed as resources and add alot of strategy to the game. 

Strategy is another thing, MK is slower than MK X, but I think thats a welcome change. It doesn't make it easier it just makes the game less about rush downs and more about different types of mix ups. There are many ways to cover distance and there is also excellent to retaliation moves and escapes, which leads to the new meter system

The new meter system just works for whatever they need it to. If you use something to avoid damage you generally use defense meter, if you use something to amplify combos or damage you use attack. Some powerful abilities use both. The best part is that it is separate from the new ""X-Ray"" system, which is now called fatal blows. They are accessible when you are about an uppercut and a half away from death. This makes fights feel tense usually till the very end, and if someone uses their Fatal blow successfully they cant use it again, like crushing blows.

Outside of combat you get your typical mk extra content and Towers from MK X have returned. The krypt is its own mini game that still requires you to grind the regular game, but this time around its full of stuff you might actually want for your characters, being as there is a Gear system in place, allowing cosmetic changes and unshockable moves. Its a pretty visually appealing time sink and gives you some gratification for getting currency in game, which is just a classic MK thing.

The Tower of Time, while pretty innovative for a fighting game, or still what you expect. Just generated fights with modifiers now and then. Some times they are pretty cool and allow for Coop or its a boss fight with a super buffed npc. Sometimes they are just frustrating because of the modifier imbalance or because it can be a huge grind of time to get the mask you want for your character, ect. Overall they went through many patches and now its more or less bearable if you are into single player content.

The online feels better than it did at launch, and thats all I can really say. Sometimes you'll still get hiccuped and die because of it, but most of the time its pretty good.
There is also ranked tournaments you can get into if you like that sort of thing, which can lead to some exclusive cosmetics.

All in all I think this is the best MK ever, even if there is no Chess Kombat ;P",1556159167,1574876013,True,10,3,0.496429562568664551,0,True,False,False,76561198018518792,627,75,9198,0,957,1591674919,,

The creators ran out of good ideas for its most famous feature a long time ago, and never seemed to have found good ideas for a story to go with it, but what remains besides is an extremely solid fighting game that has now adopted mechanics normally seen in likes of Street Fighter and Soul Calibur, like dash cancelling, perfect blocks, frame timing readouts and more.

I just want to punch ninjas as other ninjas, and to that end, Mortal Kombat has turned some of its ninjas into bedouins, zombies, the lizard from spiderman, and a robot that decided not to bleed oil just this once.

6/10.  Scorpion still says ""get over here."" and they still can't secure the rights for the theme song except for the trailer.
Enjoy getting 6 materials per fatality when you need 250 to open a box. Yep. You have to win and do a fatality 41 times to open a box. There are 20+ of those boxes. Yayyy games.

45,58134775,english,"As a casual fighting game player, since the first MK and Tekken i have to say it's a solid game.
The pc port has it's technical issues but they are hardware specific, i myself experienced only one after a patch near release.

[b]Graphics[/b] are nice and it runs smoothly on a laptop with a 1060 Geforce, 7th Series i7.
MK11 is the best Fighting Game graphic wise so far and on steam you even get 60 fps within cut scenes. i
The Stages are beautifully designed and the characters all feel distinct and polished.

[b]Story[/b] is ok, visually impressive but the writing lacks sometimes but it's a good fit in the series and the story is on par or even above every other game in the genre.

[b]Gameyplay[/b] is pretty much like every other MK in recent history but with a few good and bad additions. Fatal Blows could be better integrated the one time use per Match is nice but it being able only to use them when low lacks strategy.
It's slower than MKX and faster than MK9, so a perfect mix of both.
Mostly a perfect gameplay in terms of the fighting for a casual player but only it's still hard to find opponents that are on your level, the matchmaking often matches with people who play much better but somehow get matched with you.

[b]The Progression System[/b] is fair you can unlock your favorite things in a decent time. But to completely unlock everything it takes too much time and is sometimes a little random. The concept of the open world krypt is fresh and the immersion is great, if it were a little bit less random it would be the perfect progression system.

[b]Towers Of Time[/b] bring a unique way to unlock things and counteract the randomness of the krypt, but they are sometimes too easy and sometimes too hard because of random factors in the fight. Also the rotation every few hours/minutes makes it frustrating to unlock everything. 

[b]What is really bad: [/b] The design choice of AI Fighting, i never played injustice 2 so i did not know of this when i bought MK11 but the developers seem to have built the progression system around having your AI fight all the time to get rewards in towers. Which keeps the amount of players-in-game high but actually no one is playing the game. Often it's easier/faster to let your AI play instead of playing yourself. It is feature with nearly no advantage but many disadvantages because it had influence on the design of the whole game.
[b]But![/b] You do not have to use it too often only for some achievements and rewards and it does not ruin the game. It only makes you feel bad to either play a long time to unlock things in a repetitive environment like towers that often do not make you better because they are too easy. Or unlock things faster by letting your game running and the AI play.

[b]TL;DR; [/b]
All in all a very good entry in the series, i can recommend it to fans of the series and new players. 
At a full price you get your money's worth and in a sale you get a fine game for a good deal.
But be prepared to maybe seek for help to get better and to avoid technical difficulties.

The story no clue why people are saying its weak it is actually very good and immersive not as good as MK9 though. Overall recommend  the game highly 8/10 (fix the tower's of time's difficulty due to it being way too hard, also the krypt why you smash smashable objects such as skeletons and vases you should get alot more koins then you do like 1-9 you kidding right? there is also some crashes when you go into kustomise. I don't know why people are saying they are getting 30 fps like mate, I get 60 fps never drops. Stop playing on a Mac Book and get a proper computer.

76,50375659,english,"[h1][b]June, 1th Updated Review:[/b] As stated prior, I'm updating this review after the patches. Game after story mode is actually great now.[/h1] 

Okay, after 70h+ in this game, it's safe to say that this is a living and breathing legend of fighting games. Story mode is extremely well done, in terms of cinematics and the premise. Some dialogues are bland, and some story twists are lacking in originality, but all in all it's a must-play for any MK fan. Story is a bit shorter than MK9, though, which still holds the pedestal of the best fighting game story so far.

After you complete the story mode (which won't take you more than 8-10h), there are Towers Of Time, Krypt and online matches. I will not spoil anything for these modes, except that right now they're actually enjoyable. ToT are completable now, even without abusing the Noob Saibot AI bot for auto-play. Krypt don't have extremely expensive chests (goodbye, 10k souls chest). Online mathces are... well, they're online 1v1 matches of MK, what did you expect?

Core gameplay after completing story mode is Krypt exploration - playing matches rewards you with koins (for playing matches), souls (for winning matches) and hearts (for performing fatalities, brutalities and mercies). Each corresponding currency opens it's chest in Krypt (and there are hundreds), which contains konsumables for Towers of Time, skins for characters and lots of unlockable content.

This is not in any way, shape or form pay-to-win, and there are no grindwalls. You just play the game to unlock the content, there's no way of paying your way around it. Sure, you can buy Time Crystals, which you can spend and the shop, but there's close to no goods in it, and they're randomly switched once in a while, so that's more of nod towards people who want to pay for everything in their games.

All in all, I would say that game severely improved after the first months since release - patches made ToT actually playable and enjoyable, Krypt isn't grindy, and there's plenty of people playing online.

The only beef I have with the game right now is that it has no cross-platform multiplayer, which would have made your player base so much wider.

Other than that - this game is a true masterpiece, and a must-play for everyone, who enjoys fighting games.

[h1][b]DISCLAIMER:[/b] I may change this review later, if devs would re-design Towers of Time.[/h1]

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

In current state, game is absolutely unplayable and simply impossible to enjoy, after you complete campaign (roughly, 5-6 hours). Basic gameplay is great, online versus is okay too. But the Towers of Time... Man, it's a mess.

Towers of Time are a joke -- impossibly hard game mode, and not hard in a fair way. Your opponent would have mods, helping him, that are are absolutely unfair -- for instance, every 5 seconds you would be a damaged by a rocket that you can't block, and which damages you for 20% HP. And your opponent has 4x HP. And these rocket regen their HP. Sounds good? Then add the fact that not even your consumables will help you against some of the enemies. I'm not even sure those were playtested at all.

That being said, I haven't encountered any bugs, glitches or FPS drops -- game runs smoothly for me, since day-1. Looking forward to devs fixing Towers of Time, so I can change the review to positive -- as the game deserves.",1556479335,1574834717,True,1,0,0.533508539199829102,7,True,False,False,76561198005271335,3486,179,4455,0,3000,1597143383,,
77,58085426,english,"MK11 is a decent comeback from that monstrous abomination called MKX. It has taken everything people liked about MK10 and made it 10 times better. But then it took some of beloved characters of MK9 which made the game somewhere about 20 times better, although some lame characters are still there (I'm not saying any names).
However, the DLCs made a comeback. In fact, a whole ton of DLCs. WB Games is too greedy to be allowed to publish MK. I mean alright, keep the Kombat Pack. It is tolerable and has been since MK9. But these skin packs for 6$ each? Fuck no. Fuck. No. Oh, did I forget to mention some of the fighters that have to be bought separately? I mean, I have all the DLCs, I actually have no problem with that, but what if I start to main Shang Tsung for say and then come over to my friend to play some MK11 who didn't want to buy these DLCs? That's just an assumed situation which might happen to some, but that's still a big con for the game.
The story mode is... weird. Let's say I have mixed feelings about it. Overall I enjoyed it but I really think it hurt the MK canon, but let's leave in to Netherrealm studios, they might know what they're doing. Spoiler alert. [spoiler] I hate the fact that they restart the history for the second time. Like god fucking damn it, it was fully understandable in MK9 since WB games bought the franchise and they had their own vision of events. But why restart it again? Will we have to replay the first MK tournament again? Or do we need to expect some sort of plot changes that aren't even going to be mentioned in the next game's story mode? I'm infuriated by this to be honest. [/spoiler]
The best part about MK11 are Towers of Time. At first I really hated the grinding system but then I gave it a should and had zero regrets. It is so fulfilling to get rewarded for a tower completion, even if it's just going to be some sort of colour variation of an original character skin or an intro. Netherrealm learned how to engage players to prolong the game time and make singleplayer more exciting, adding another purpose to the game on top of just spending good time with your friends when they come over. Sure, they also had it in MKX, but it didn't have the grinding system, and let's say it straight away: MKX was a failure, it wasn't exciting to play it at all.
I also love the way they remodeled the fighting system. Sure, it takes some time to get used to it, but when you do, the MK9 and MKX fighting systems seem very odd and outdated. A very good bonus, props to Netherrealm studios.
The graphics is just... wow. Not that it is the best graphics ever, but it's very appealing. The only downside is blur. I didn't check if you can turn it off in settings, but keep that in mind. Personally I don't like when motion gets blurry, it hurts my eyes. The fighters don't have this weird reptiloid skin after the end of the fight which used to bug me a lot in MKX, so that's nice.
To sum up, MK11 is a good MK game. It's definitely worth buying if you enjoyed previous WB MK games, I would recommend to buy Kombat Pack as well and leaving those skin packs behind. I would also recommend with a little pinch of a doubt to buy extra characters which are sold separately (except Frost, she's unlockable in the story mode), but I'm leaving it up to yourself.

they have removed the X-rays and replaced them with a fatal attack that can be used once per match witch is better.
button mashing...... boy has it improved I can actually kill someone thats better then me :P

50,50319213,english,"Despite its name, Mortal Kombat 11 is actually the 22nd entry into the brutal fighting franchise that has captured the heart, and spines, of fighting fans all over the world for the last 27 years. It's safe to say that NetherRealm lost the adoration of their long-term fan base once the series went into the 3D arena era, leaving behind its 2D fighting roots and expanding to cover a vast array of unwanted mechanics and additions. With that said, and along with the help of Warner Bros, NetherRealm was able to pull this seemingly dead franchise back together with Mortal Kombat 9 (2011), and subsequently Mortal Kombat X.

As sad as it is to say, all good things cannot last forever. There are many aspects of Mortal Kombat 11 that will drive away long-term fans once again; especially those who despise it when companies dumb down mechanics and add pointless grinding in for good measure. Starting off with some of the good elements, it can be said that the story is pretty decent; you'll get to see a lot of the main staple characters alongside their past and future selves, and the roster is fairly all-encompassing when it comes to blending fan favorites with MK9 and MKX kombatants, while also leaving room for a few newbies to be thrown into the mix. Going forward, I'm going to be referencing Scorpion a lot since he's a main for a lot of people, newcomers and old fans, and his moves are probably the most identifiable to anyone reading this.

Now for the bad, and unfortunately there is quite a lot of it. This review is a tell-all, so if you're not here for the long haul you might as well move on now. About 90% of Mortal Kombat 11 is frame-locked to 30 FPS. In fact, the only part that isn't capped at 30 is the actual fights, which are capped at 60. This begs the ever dominate question in most aspects of life... why? Why does the krypt, main menu, character customization, fatalities, and fatal blows have to be capped at 30 FPS? Sure, we could overlook the prerendered scenes of the story mode and others, but the aforementioned just does not make sense. This is the least of Mortal Kombat 11's worries since there have been a variety of changes made to the actual gameplay.

As such, nearly every character's classic moves have been augmented to render using them in a kombo completely impossible unless you ""amplify"" them, which takes up limited gauges; for example, Scorpion's regular spear move is now abruptly ended by an uncontrolled sword swing so pulling an opponent in to unleash a devastating kombo on them is no longer a thing. You can, however, amplify the move to do somewhat of a kombo, but the limit gauge ensures you can only do it twice in quick succession. Long gone are the fluid, player-created kombos from MK9 and MKX, and instead in their place are clunky, pre-rendered kombos that honestly just feel stale, look unappealing, and dumb down a franchise that once bragged about how its players were the ones who created kombos in the first place; since MK1 was never designed for that type of gameplay. It's horrible, and anyone used to the previous two entries is in for a massive wake up call when attempting to execute anything that was learned prior. Additionally, you're now forced to choose certain special moves per character variation instead of having access to all special moves, and many of the moves that were introduced in the previous two installments have completely vanished; for example, Scorpion's Hellfire moves.

Moving on, let's talk about the grinding. As most gamers are aware, anytime that the Krypt is in a Mortal Kombat game, you'll need to amass currency to unlock the chests and other goodies within it. It's the same this time around, except now instead of only Koins, you'll need Souls and Hearts. All of these things can be gained through regular gameplay, but the amounts that you acquire versus the amounts that you need to spend are insanely different; for instance, you might gain 5,000 Koins, 8 Hearts, and a few Souls by playing the second easiest tower on medium difficulty, but you'll spend anywhere from 1,000 - 250,000 Koins, 250 Hearts, and 100 - 10,000 Souls per chest. I might also mention that the Krypt is MASSIVE; it's in third-person which is cool, it's fun, full of puzzles, Easter Eggs, and surprises, but it's marred greatly by the amount of grinding that's necessary to get anywhere in it. Your rewards? Cosmetics, brutalities, fatalities, Kombat Kard backgrounds and icons, items for the new forge, and Konsumables.

The Krypt isn't the only thing you'll be grinding for. Each character now has their own tower that you can buy with, you guessed it, Koins. The first tower is 25,000, and each subsequent one increases by that amount. While the first tower for each character is easy and straight forward, the second one will see you doing 75 Fatalities and 75 Brutalities, and even deeper into the towers you'll have to do 100 Krushing Blows, spill a certain amount of blood, and achieve other feats just to unlock something you've already paid for. And the real kicker here? These tallies only count while the towers are active. So if you did 50 Fatalities with Scorpion before activating the second stage of his tower, none of those counted towards the goal.

So I've already written two paragraphs about grinding, but how about a third? You'll also be grinding experience points for your new gear pieces. Each piece of gear, three separate pieces per character (IE: Scorpion has his mask, sword, and spear), needs to be leveled up to unlock augmentation slots. Augmentations can increase a variety of things for the character, such as certain skills doing increased damage, or being able to damage blocking enemies at a higher rate. Thankfully, as this has recently been pointed out to me, these augmentations do not affect online play. But oh, and you found a piece of gear that you like the look of more? Now you have to level that piece, too.

I usually don't like to throw my own biased opinions into my reviews, but I can't help but do that with Mortal Kombat 11. I've been playing this franchise since I was 5 years old. For 25 years now, and through 22 total releases in the series, I've managed to maintain my love and devotion; for all of the blood, guts, gore, secrets, and especially the lore. As one of the most long-devoted fans of Mortal Kombat, I must say that this entry is a travesty that bleeds together the once thick line between the Injustice franchise, and the Mortal Kombat series. As fans of Mortal Kombat, this is not what we want. We do not want Injustice 3.0, we want our series that NetherRealm and Warner Brothers have worked so hard to resurrect with the amount of work and effort that they put into restoring the franchise after the major screw-ups that the 3D arena era games brought.

In closing, it should be said that Mortal Kombat 11 has a lot of potential, but it's too much like Injustice instead of itself. NetherRealm has completely gutted the kombo system, and instead instilled their own kombos instead of letting players create them as they have been doing for the last 27 years. There's way, way, way too much grinding for Krypt items, which will ultimately lead to people purchasing whatever microtransactions they're going to implement in the near future. The 30 FPS lock is both lazy and ridiculous. I'll go ahead and say it... the Fatalities aren't even that great in comparison to MKX; they're honestly just okay, and the same can be said for the Brutalities. The story mode is the most appealing part of this release, and at least it allows the franchise another chance in the future.

61,53432663,english,"Pros
++++
+ Great franchise the most solid one as well played it since 1996
+ Great Kharacters (except jackie briggs)
+ New Kharacters 
+ Variation system [didn't liked it as much] Huge variety of move lists completely wasted
+ Kostume variation (Good for single player content and bad for online and competitive environments)
+ The most balancing NRS game yet  especially at launch (but still they need to master it and to stop targeting casual players)
+ Good learning curve and knowledge is key to win
+ Good Combat System .. Fatal Blows, Crushing Blows, and Flawless Block
+ New meter System, 2 meter burn moves for each offensive and defensive Attacks far better than any of NRS Games (need some nerfs  to regenerate slowly)
+ New defensive mechanic [ Quick hop moves, Flawless Block, Block dashing and universal wake up moves (bringing new mind games to the table) [10/10]
+ 50/50s has been reduced but still there, so rush down automatically reduced as well
+ Offensive armor Moves been reduced (except Fatal Blows and Environmental attack)
+ NJP ground bounces are gone (good call)
+ Brilliant animations (except poke & low Kicks)
+ Beginner friendly sort of difficult to master not that hard tho
+ The Neutral and Footsies are back (but still NRS game afterall)  
+ Great value for single player content for those whose not seeking online Matches (Story mode, Arcade, Krypt and Towers)
+ Best 2d fighting game ever no one come even close
+ Outstanding Graphics the best for its genre
+ Awesome Stages (needs some klassics)
+ The gore and violence is overwhelming, best Fatalities, Brutalities and Fatal Blows yet of the whole franchise
+ Good Soundtrack some epic ones in it
+ The net code is superb since MKXL Update 
+ Fortunately the port has finally been settled after the first month and a half now
+ Exclusive stuff for the PC only The Master Race ""60 FPS Option for Menu, Intros, Fatal Blows and the krypt""
+ Preload option which is nice (still not enough marketing for PC)
+ Good Gear system (but sadly behind a grind wall or monetisation in-game purchases randomly)
+ This game has such a great vibe to it, very immersive
+ Great Game overall need some tweaks to rewards and by add more recovery for some Keep away kharacters (there's a lot of anti-Zoning Khars tho)

Kons
----
- Base Roster should be at least 30 Kharacters 
- move lists is small , Huge variety of move lists wasted because of the Variation system witch is bad they need to get rid of it IN THE Future Builds
- They are keeps saying balancing issue if we combine all moves, they can by making all special moves heavily punishable (how about Tekken the most balancing  Game and has over 130 moves per Character)
- They are not take care of veteran players as well [by keep changing move lists and that we need to re-learn from 0 like we never played it before] Also Tekken Same Moves about 2 decade
- No running, so cancel moves are almost gone so combos becomes a lot easier (skill gap been reduced also)
- Too much focus on Keep away Kharactars they need to turn down projectile heavy Khars, problems known for NRS games (there are lots of anti-Zoning Khars tho)
- Risk Rewards is very bad in this game needs balancing
- Mids are too strong to strike throws afterwords and shifted to only for handful of kharacters
- Low boke needs some more recovery on block
- Fatal Blows should be heavily punishable about -40 to -45 of recovery
- Lack of some original Kharacters and beloved ones as well
- NRS They are Console slaves, Also their Games cost now about (120-140 $) [all the props goes to WB for porting this game to PC by hiring (QLOC & Shiver) cause NRS they cannot handle it]
- Microtransactions started it with their Mobile games and the progression its seems that way of a free to play game
- The Grind is huge thats makes you think you have to buy some Crystals (For the Krypt stuff)
- Kombat pack 1 and kombat pack 2 on the horizon total of 12 Khars [+-]
- And that's it they well not support the game after 1 to 1.5 year no matter what (I Hope I'm Wrong) "" WB Said they will supporting it for years""
- Unfortunately, There are some random Crashes at first just like injustice 2 port (FOR only a month and a half to be honest)
- Display settings are bad again just like injustice 2 you have to put (full screen vsync on to be good or borderless vsync off) and the two options has weaknesses at vsync on there is some delay on vsync off reduced in quality pictures.
- They are not listening to the fans
- I don't get it after the harsh backlash on Mournful Kitana for Jade from the fans and now they did it with Mileena (still think she will be in KP2)
- No fan service or Klassic Kostume (The female Kharacters were purposefully de-sexualized)
- Online ranking System not that good (I do understand why, it well reduced player base, and that's why i'm not against it)
- [spoiler] The Story mode sort of good.[/spoiler]
- I'd take 60 khars over story mode any day [only for fighting games]

OVERALL: Great franchise and the most iconic one as well , didn't liked much the 3d era ones of the game, the thing is most franchises has its ups and down in terms of quality content, Especially for a fighting games.. also NRS has some balancing issues over the years and they just keep tweaking over and over again ... that being said its my favorite Game ever with Tekken.",1562192834,1574801731,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,76561198196622441,198,3,42807,1006,8628,1602032925,,

96,52071600,english,"[b]Mortal Kombat 11 is a pretty solid game to play. I realize there are some mixed reviews with this game here on Steam one being the mouth of the fighters still not moving, the game crashing quite frequently to there being a 30 fps cap in Shang Tsung Krypt. All I can say is that before I purchased this game during the Steam sale up until now the developers have been doing a great job of adding patches to fix some of the bugs and hiccups that have been occuring to some people. So they have been working to try and keep people happy and up to date on whats happening to the game. 



Is the game good enough to run at a 60 fps rate you ask? I would have to say yes it is.  Does the game still need more patching up? I would have to yes it does most definitely as I have encountered lagging and a 30 fps cap in Shang Tsung Krypt along with some but not all of the fighters mouths not moving. A part from these 3 issues I haven't encountered anything else such as the game  randomly crashing or the inconsistent 60 fps drops during game play. I've found that it stays at 60 fps and I don't see or notice any drops but that's me and everyone runs different hardware in there PC I hope this helps some what in your decision.

[h1] THIS IS AN EDITED REVIEW! READ WHAT IS ABOVE AND ONLY![/h1]
Edit: they've fixed most part of the grind, but the game still has the server issues disconnect.

Well, first of all the game looks amazing, new gameplay mechanics, new interface and new everything.
However... 

Microtransactions, [b]unstable[/b] FPS and [b]Konstant Diskonnects[/b] from the server itself (even if you are offline).
The PC port is terrible, and it is disapointing coming from a large enterprise such as Warner. How could they come with a unstable game that drops to 30 fps in the menus?? 
The game feels really slow when it shouldn't be like this, it feels like you are in an slow motion scene, every second. Not even the krypt escapes from it, it feels way weirder in it by the way. 
Badly optimized, my graphic card wasn't even recognized by the game itself (gtx 1050ti). So the experience it is QUITE ruined, at least the fps doesn't drop below 30, it just feels like slow motion.

[h1] Microtransactions[/h1] 

This is a serious topic but [b]be aware[/b].

this is [b]NOT[/b] the developers guilt! Warner just realized Mortal Kombat is extremely lucrative to them, so they tried to get even more money from it, obviously.
But the way they did is HORRENDOUS!
Mortal Kombat 11 looks like a free to play game filled with microtransactions, buying the premium edition for 83,45 dollars (330 brazilian real) made me feel sick expending all this money to get a game filled with microtransactions for gear. Americans seeing this, get in mind that the average salary (not wage) is 1000 brl, 30% of this. And yet, if i want to get the gear, fatalitys and brutalitys without grinding like an unocupied child playing rpg, i have to pay 20 brazilian real for one komplete appearance or brutality (you can not use them without unlocking).

It is disgusting.

The time towers looked great, i really liked them. But some challenges are so unfair, that isn't worth the effort just to get one skin (and they know that).

So, why the hell we get expensive microtransactions for an expensive game? haven't we paid enough??
My complain isn't the microtransactions theyself, but the price they came (at least in my country)

5 bucks we can buy 1 gear/skin
10 bucks we can buy 2
20 bucks we can buy 5

Again: It is too expensive for a paid expensive game, even for first world countrys.

My suggestion for the prices would be

Krystals and prices

1$ maximum 2.5$  - 500 Krystals;
2.5$ maximum 5$ - 1200 Krystals;
9.99$ maximum 12$ - 2500 Krystals
15$ maximum 21$ - 5600 Krystals

Of course this won't be happening, and i can expect some guys arguing against this.

And they did a dick move, and yes, a REALLY dick move.

You can unlock frost in the main story, and yet they put her for 6 bucks in the store, so people would think she is a DLC character and buy her before playing the main story.

BUT...
Let's stop talking about the flaws, and talk about the flawless;

[h1] Wonderfull game, story and graphics[/h1]

Besides the problems the game has (hope they fix all of this soon) the story mode looks amazing. It could be almost be compared to the avengers. [strike]Possibly spoilers[/strike]: [spoiler]Finally Liu Kang gets the ending he deserved, finally every game untill now was explained with cronica's existence, who played or watched it, could see the fight of Raiden vs Liu Kang in countless timelines, even the armaggeddon one, with revenant liu kang. [/spoiler]

It was well writen, and well executed, honestly, in the story mode i did not cared about the fight, but only the cutscenes, they were [b]outstanding[/b].

Kronica was well introduced in the story of Mortal Kombat, and she was the fix the developers needed for the plotholes and nonsense until MK 9.

The characters look AMAZING, the customization looks INCREDIBLE and the moveset of them looks UNIQUE, i've never seen a fighting game like this before, it looks way arcade to be honest. I can see myself playing MK11 in an arcade joystick.

[h1] The Kombat[/h1]

The Kombat feels smooth as ever, the punishes now makes sense, the hitboxes looks corrected, the movelist is pleasant to the eyes, everything looks great in it.

The characters seems to have their weaks and strong points, that's why most of them seems viable to a tournament.
It isn't a game of just throw a huge Kombo and win, it feels way more strategic.

OVERALL AT DAY 1

[B]6 out of 10[/B]

It is with a pain that i give a 6, i loved the game, but it is way too unstable to be actually enjoyed by someone who never played the game.

PERSONAL NOTE
[B]8 out of 10[/B]

it could be easily a 10 at day one, but saddly every new gen game on pc is trending to release poorly.

73,57543437,english,"Mortal Kombat 11 Review

A little disclaimer. Let me just say that I will not be discussing in detail the major controversies surrounding this title, what with all the female fighters wearing less revealing clothing or clothes that are mandatory in certain Mideast countries, a cringefully ‚Äòwoke‚Äô & out-of-character arcade ending for a certain African-American fighter, character dialogues taking shots at Trump, and microtransactions. I‚Äôll leave a video or two discussing those below.

Now that‚Äôs out of the way, on to the review!

Mortal Kombat‚Äôs 25+ year history continues with the latest entry in the series, simply titled Mortal Kombat 11. How does it compare to NetherRealm Studios‚Äô recent MK titles? Well, it‚Äôs sort of a mixed bag.

First, the gameplay. It feels a little slow and simple compared to MK9. The special gauge meter has been changed, removing the often useful combo breaker and replacing it with useless recovery options. Remember when you fight hard to put your special gauge for those x-Ray attacks, combo breakers and special attacks? Well, prepare to be disappointed as they‚Äôve been replaced with Call of Duty-style auto-regeneration. It doesn‚Äôt bother me, but I like putting in the effort to build meter. The one change I did like was the new Fatal Blow attacks, which replaces the X-Ray attacks. They are powerful cinematic attacks that become active when your character‚Äôs health bar is low. They are also strategic in nature because when you use them once, you can‚Äôt use them again for the remainder of the match. Use them wisely! The environment interaction attacks are back, for better or worse. Good thing you can turn them off in the options menu.

The graphics are top notch, especially during the fatal blows and the fatalities. NetherRealm sure has improved since Mortal Kombat X. 

The story is good, except Ronda Rousey‚Äôs wooden voice acting. Taking cues from Injustice 2‚Äôs story mode by giving players the option to choose between two fighters in some chapters. I wished some characters got a little more development. There are multiple endings (with the true ending achievable upon beating the final boss in only two rounds). It makes you wonder where they‚Äôll take Mortal Kombat next whether it‚Äôd be a better game or a PS2-era game with increased SJW-infectious diseases.

The roster is better than MKX, with some fan favourites returning such as Kabal and Jade along with some new faces such as Cetrion and Kollector who looks like Mumm-Ra from Thundercats had a kid with Sheeva (Seriously, he looks like freakin‚Äô Mumm-Ra). There will be more coming via DLC, but can we PLEASE get an MK game without guest characters for once, NetherRealm? The Terminator is fine and Spawn looks to be amazing, but I think I speak for most people when I say we need more classic characters such as Smoke, Cyrax or Mileena over characters like Leatherface, Jason Voorhees. On a side note, I hope we do get Ash Williams in the game (An Evil Dead fan btw.)

Gone from MKX is the mediocre 3 variation system, which allows players to choose between 3 fighting styles, and required relearning character moves if you get bored with the other variation. In its place, is a customization system which lets you choose which moves, intros, gear, outros, and character skins to suit up your character and play style which sadly ruined Injustice 2 for me, but I find it better used here. When customizing Shang Tsung for example, I gave him a costume with a shade of one of my favourite colours, giving him moves from various MK ninjas (my condolences to those who wanted Reptile or Rain in the game...) and kickass intro. However, getting most or all of these skins and gear items are both grindy and eventually boring. Which brings us to...

The Towers of Time. This is where you‚Äôll mostly end up playing and eventually sleeping through in the entire game. Completing each tower rewards you with character gear, skins, konsumables and fake money you can use in the Krypt rather than donating your entire college fund to get all the things you want. And the character & gear rewards are random. Looking for Shang Tsung‚Äôs ‚ÄúYour soul is MINE!‚Äù victory outro (Who wouldn‚Äôt?) or a certain skin/gear piece for Kitana that‚Äôs as close as the developers at NetherRealm will let us have that‚Äôs identical to her UMK3 costume? Tough crap, just tune in to a She-Ra marathon on Netflix for an x amount of hours until said skin and gear are available to get. For me, the experience got a little boring after awhile and only focused on characters I‚Äôm used to playing rather that 100% the entire game. Why not just scrap the microtransactions and give us everything to unlock for free instead? Your experience may differ however.

But the biggest improvement is without a doubt the Krypt. Not only because they got Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa, occasionally typecast as a bad guy in movies and tv shows, but better known among MK fans as Shang Tsung from the original 1995 movie, to appear in both the appearance and voice of the MK11 version of the soul-stealing sorcerer himself, but all those jump scares and QuickTime events from the last two titles? They all disappeared like Marvel Vs Capcom Infinite‚Äôs fan base. The Krypt has the player go around and open chests using whatever money, souls and hearts they‚Äôve slowly grinded, and unlock new areas using acquired skills obtain throughout the mode and items obtained from the Towers of Time. Each chest contains new skins gear and character/background art to view in the Kollection. But the experience can be hampered by random rewards upon locking chests, occasional deaths if you‚Äôre not careful and like the Towers of Time, the experience can get boring. Thankfully, you can simply reverse time using time crystals to restore some of the chests.

Final Thoughts:

Mortal Kombat 11 is both a step up from MKX and a step down from MK9. The minor gameplay tweaks, character roster, graphics and Krypt are the game‚Äôs only strengths while everything else is hampered by a tedious grinding system, SJW-isms, and the same microtransactions/gear system that killed Injustice 2. If you must get this game despite everything I‚Äôve told you about, please just buy MK9 and wait for the inevitable Mortal Kombat 11 complete edition to come out instead.

(Original review)

The good: The story is great. I usually am kinda meh when it comes to fighting game stories, but MK11 makes me want to play the story. The graphics are sublime, NRS really stepped their game up with their mocap and facial animations. The gameplay is really solid, combo's feel impactful and the brutalities/xrays are as gruesome as ever.

The bad: There are several reports of performance issues. It has happened to me as well, mostly to do with sudden crashes when playing the story or customizing characters

The ugly:  This game has an incredibly long grind. Nearly everything is locked behind RNG that takes a long time just to get the currency. Even though there is no way to directly buy lootboxes, there are still lootboxes scattered all over the Krypt and it is one of the only ways to get things. The only other way is to do towers, which often need the loot to begin with to beat the harder towers, and a premium shop which randomly cycles through 5 or so items. It does not respect the player's time.

As it is right now I can not recommend picking it up right now, maybe if you are a die hard fan or really love the gameplay. They need to fix the bugs and seriously need to take a look at the loot system. Wait until it goes on sale, or at least until it gets fixed.",1556074483,1574247327,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198082064087,134,2,8282,5,128,1602032474,,

While the gear system seems like it can turn into a bit of a grind fest at first, if there's something you really want for your main or secondary NRS has made it possible to pick up all sorts of cool items with regular events now. So it's not as grindy as it used to be. The game gives plenty of opportunity to snag things you're looking for. 

The community has it's bad apples like with most fighting games. but for the most part MK11's players are more or less well mannered.

With regular Kombat Leagues taking place every few months, you can play this game as competitively or as kasually as you want. Online isn't without it's faults, but provided you and your opponent both have a solid land line things run pretty well. I don't recommend playing online via wifi, but if it's your only option I haven't found it to be too much of an issue and have had very few disconnections.

Los golpes sin freno de Kung Lao, los ataques con hacha de Sub-Zero, las combinaciones de disparo de Erron Black, los ataques combinados de Noob Saibot y su sombra, cada combo tiene algo que habla del personaje en s√≠. 
Y la cantidad de contenido. Hay trajes para todos los personajes, y aunque puede ser tedioso conseguirlos, hay que dejar en claro que todos pueden conseguirse mediante gameplay, excepto algunas nuevos dise√±os introducidos como DLC. Pero hay contenido de sobra por el precio de $60 o su equivalente en pesos.
Un juego que se le nota el cari√±o, la dedicaci√≥n y el amor.
Que despu√©s la historia de la campa√±a tenga sus agujeros, s√≠, los tiene. Pero es entretenida. Satisface, y es mucho m√°s de lo que se puede decir de otros juegos de pelea, o incluso, de juegos narrativos.

13,56645186,english,"Highly recommended!

I was iffy on purchasing this because of negative reviews, but I think it's absolutely fantastic.  I'm a vs CPU only player, though, fwiw. The story is fun, the animations, graphics, and voice acting in the story are pretty amazing (I'm about 80% through story). Getting to choose who to play between 2 fighters in some sections is great.

The fighting is solid, feels like MK, and is customizable in a cool way that feels less complicated than they did with MKX.

There are tons of unlockables, I haven't even scratched the surface, and these can be upgraded (over a long time) for slight advantages.

The character training is useful but has some mega detailed info that's for serious competitive fighters that makes me zone out on info overload. Still a cool resource for the hardcore.

There are a lot of extra things to keep you busy, tons of solo fight modes, definitely high value.

===========
GAMEPLAY: 10 - easy to pick up, deep enough to keep you working on mastering it for ages. Tons of content. It's compelling in a way SF V just isn't.

GRAPHICS: 10 - super smooth frame rate, tons of detail. a few things could be improved (vfx is what comes to mind), but it's still a high 9, rounded to 10 

AUDIO: 10 - great impact sfx, cool music, great VO

STORY: 9 - it's fun in a classic cheesy MK way. They did a great job almost making everything make sense. XD

There's a lot of single player content through the towers and the story mode, and online is relatively stable and fun to experiment with different mashups. While the soundtrack is lame and nonexistent, the sound effects add to that crunchy feel.

A lot has to be said of how they fixed the crappy system from the last game. If you, like me, hated how characters' traditional moves were split between 3 different sets, they moved abilities/special moves to Kustomization, so you pick your own moves yourself. The systems flexible enough to make a fun variant of the classic characters!

I cannot recommend the season pass, as some characters are lame. As of now I have played Shang Tsung, Nightwolf, and The Terminator. My friend has the season pass, but I elected to stay away from it as all characters are available to fight against, even if you can't fight as them. With that being said, Shang Tsung is kinda lame, and the Terminator's animations are horrible, with some being rips from Jason from the last game...very disappointing. At 6 bucks I've picked up Nightwolf, who is very fun and satisfying to play, with easy-to-learn-hard-to-master combos and a bunch of cool links. I also grabbed the Terminator cuz the new movie is actually pretty fun, and sometimes I like to impress my friends and bring out my shit Terminator play.

Difficult to pick up, difficult to master. Perfect for people who want a skill ceiling. This way there's more room for mistakes for others. 
Match making is okay. Only issue is that people quit mid match. Sometimes you get stomped for an hour and finally meet someone you can beat but they leave. Micro transactions exist, but it seems like you can get a good bit of cosmetics from just playing. 
I love/hate the krypt. Many secrets which require some tutorials if you wanna 100% it, which sucks. The grind to get to Shang's throne room is immense. It's immersive though and I quite enjoy the size and depth of the Krypt. 
Some characters have a cancerous playstyles and IMO can get very annoying. Jax, Jade, Geras, and (insert character that pisses you off) to name a few. A player who knows the 50/50s and can implement them can ruin your day.
If you are a gaming elitist, you can get the Ranked Kombat skins and get ranked too. I'm not sure if some of them can be recycled some seasons so the more casual players can attempt to get things they had missed. 
Overall though, the game is fantastic. The visuals are nice. Hits feel visceral and have that extra oomph. Kosmetics for each character are styled well and I enjoy the ""past"" skins (Revenant Liu Kang, Old Liu Kang) etc. 
Despite fighting against annoying characters, it still doesn't make me wanna stop. I just wanna figure out how to get past it. I couldn't care less about the Kombat pack, not because of who they are, but because I feel like the roster is fleshed out already. The kombat packs are just extra. I hate that you have to pay for that DLC, but whatever. I would suggest this game to anybody who enjoys fighting games, or enjoys MK.

91,50290947,english,"Overall, this game is rough and the overall handling of the launch delay was scummy. No word was mentioned from Ed himself, nor was anything mentioned on the NRS Twitter. This isn't a great business move if you also consider that the entire NRS team has preached communication all the way up to the launch of the game. They posted in the game's forum on Steam an hour before midnight about the delay. Again, this was another mistake. Steam forums are the last place anyone searches for information, especially on fighting games. Each fighting game (usually) has their own site with a forum, which is where most of the players usually find information and post things. For NRS titles, that site is Test Your Might. They should've immediately went to Twitter, Ed or the NRS handle should've stated this long before the launch. Instead, we have a bunch of frustrated gamers, with no reasoning behind the delay. This was not a great business move and warrants a ""don't buy"" right out of the gate. Devs need to held accountable for stuff like this, and as consumers we need to let them know that this is not to be tolerated. Delaying a game is fine if it's to make sure the game is playable at launch, but when you delay a game and offer zero reasoning why, that's never going to work out well for anyone.

With that said.....

Gameplay is ok atm, although there are certain things popping up that might flip flop this. Dash cancelling being the main thing I've seen so far, that looks to defeat the purpose of the game being footsie based. It's nearly the equivalent of the run mechanic. I don't know how to do it, yet, but by the looks of it it looks extremely OP. It also looks quite stupid. 

Graphics aren't anything to write home about. Hair looks rough, along with certain textures as well. Anti aliasing in the game also isn't that good. If I'm going to be honest, this game at max settings at 1080p, looks like a console version. You would never guess it was a PC game if you didn't know before looking at it. This is subjective, but this is how it looks to me.

Microtransactions. I'm not going to get into it, as everyone else will have already done it. Just know, it's REALLY bad. Be aware. Most people crapped on Street Fighter for this, this game is miles ahead of what Capcom did. It makes SFV's microtransactions look pedestrian.
EDIT: The above (microtransactions) was posted when the Towers of Time were unreasonably hard. Since then it's been patched and skins are much easier to get as towers aren't ridiculously difficult. I haven't spent a dime on any skins so far.

Performance is pretty good. I don't see why people are complaining about frame rates during Fatal Blows, 30FPS is the standard across all platforms. The reason for that is, they want them to look cinematic. I get that some people want to be able to uncap it, and understandably so. I don't mind it. I've yet to see any frame drops, which is a good sign.

Crashing is a big issue. Plenty people have mentioned it already. In my experience with about 80 minutes on the game, I've already crashed twice. IT WASN'T EVEN DURING GAMEPLAY!! Both of my crashes occurred inside the menus of the game. This needs to be fixed ASAP.

QLOC has their work cut out for them, that's for sure. Graphically, this game needs some work. It looks grainy as hell, which in turn makes hair look like garbage. Antialiasing also needs some more polish. The crashing issue is widespread, and seems to ignore even the most expensive rigs. 

Overall, I cannot recommend this game. It's not in a good place right now. Even if you're a hardcore fan, which I also am, I'd wait. It's not worth full price yet, considering how their dev team handled the launch and how absolutely disgusting their microtransaction model currently is. Gameplay isn't getting rid of that nasty taste in your mouth. I bought the premium version as well, which I don't think it's worth buying either. The skins and gear are meh. The best part is the Kombat Pack and Shao Kahn. Even still, those are guesses as well. Kahn could be garbage tier, and the first wave of DLC characters could be underwhelming. 

The only time I can recommend a buy, is at sale price with the base game. Stay away from the full price game, and any of the ""upgraded"" versions. They're not worth it.

EDIT: Game still needs a lot of balancing. Most of the performance issues have been iron'd out. I'm still leaving this review as a ""NO"" for how bad the launch was.",1556060688,1572575720,False,6,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198233492512,44,18,55231,199,89,1602051536,,

62,55664254,english,"[This review was made after certain major patches adjusted the grind to be player-favorable. It also doesn't cover the Kombat Pack since this is about the core game.]

While I did play MK9 (2011), I skipped MKX and didn't really enjoy my time with it after picking it up for free about a year ago. Where MK9 was the right amount of cheesy serious storytelling, MKX went for a more visceral and gruesome approach. I feel kind of weird saying it, but Mortal Kombat belongs in the realm of self-aware violence and just the right amount of crazy, but not gruesome.

So, Mortal Kombat 11. It strikes that chord between visceral and self-aware almost perfectly. If anything, MK11 is at its best when you can tell they had fun writing the interactions between characters. It feels almost like a museum, referencing the entire history of Mortal Kombat from the original arcade game to MKX; it's immensely charming. The interactions between characters is important, although they don't separate Revenant dialogue with Human dialogue in PvP matches on occasion, which can be off-putting.

The actual cosmetics you can obtain from characters is insane, ranging from recreations of classic gear to brand-new styles that fit the character perfectly. Except for characters like Cassie Cage and Kollector, which suffer from skins and gear that really don't work for them, and you can easily tell. Cassie Cage has these Mass Effect-esque skins that really don't work, and any of the skins that would work are given to Sonya Blade, oddly enough.

Now if you want to get cosmetics for your character, all you have to do is check the customization screen to find out where to get it. Once it was insane to grind out gear in Towers of Time, but after a recent patch, getting gear is as easy as selecting a character and completing Towers with the ""Selected Character"" reward. Character Towers also once had insane requirements like ""75 Brutalities,"" which have been reduced to more manageable ""25 Brutalities,"" and so on. The random modifiers that once plagued the game with insane nonsense, basically making the game unacceptable without setting an AI fighter to do all the work, have entirely been adjusted and made substantially easier.

The Krypt has also been optimized a little more, with Krypt events cycling almost every week with some of the most highly-demanded gear in the game to be obtained easily, even granting the paid currency ""Time Krystals"" in bulk. Skeleton Keys to open more of the Krypt are now very easy to find, and the Koin, Soul Fragments, and Hearts currencies are paid out in extremes, meaning you could easily open the entirety of the Krypt in a matter of days, compared to weeks. Although some of the skins and gear are still locked behind the slot machine known as the Naknadan Krypt Shrine, and the Forge which requires you to get rare drops of single-use items to make other gear, which despite my playtime, I still haven't found every item. (Also, some of the recipes are actually wrong, but luckily they've all been documented properly on other websites.)

I'm not much of an online player, either, so knowing that certain skins and gear are locked behind the Kombat League, a competitive league that has suffered from a myriad of exploits like the Forfeit Set exploit, or lagswitching, makes it undesirable to get anything, despite the skins being some of the best in the game. However, there are plenty of ways to play online outside of that, including lobbies and even an online training mode. It also has Discord integration so you can find your friends and invite them more easily, although you'll be just fine using the Steam invites anyways.

In terms of the core roster, I actually adore all of the characters, even the new ones like Cetrion. They all have a unique style, and I found myself playing quite a lot of them. I have personal reasons as to why I don't like Sonya Blade's face model and voice actress, but Sonya as a character plays very well. A lot of characters have crazy combo potential in a corner, and with the addition of the third competitive variations with some minor adjustments to certain abilities, some characters are more fun than at launch.

The Time Krystals are a paid currency, but seeing as how the only things you can buy are cosmetics, or Easy Fatalities, and that they basically give you these Krystals all the time for free, it's basically more of a ""finish the gear checklist currency."" The store also has bundles of gear and intros for characters in daily rotation, the price of these bundles also reduces if you already have certain items in the list.

So I honestly don't regret my purchase. As patches come out (which still come out weeks after the console patches since the game's updates are done by Qloc, a third-party company, but they actually do things compared to the horror stories of MKX), the game gets easier to play. The grind for gear is about 10% of what it used to be. What could have taken years has honestly been reduced to maybe a few months for someone who only spends a few hours a week playing, and maybe two or three months for someone playing it non-stop.

It's come a long way since launch, and there are still adjustments being made every single patch. It's honestly my favorite game in the series. Notice that I didn't really touch on the story, because honestly it leaves a lot to be desired, and the ""Character Tower"" endings are much better. They also do a ""Kombat Pack preview"" Tower of Time every time a character in the Kombat Pack is released, regardless on if you own it. If the idea of it being all online throws you off, I'd recommend it on a sale, but for me it was well worth the price of admission.",1571461634,1571461634,True,46,5,0.786686062812805176,1,True,False,False,76561198000690337,878,3,34762,0,31894,1596836470,,

72,50906847,english,"This is my first ever Mortal Kombat and my 2nd fighting game (Injustice 2).

 First the stuff that i find to be good:

The gameplay:
Of course the gameplay is excellent. The first thing i did was play the multiple tutorials and i have to say that NetherRealm Studios have done an exceptional job at explaining the different mechanics of the game e. g. Kombos, Kombo starters and enders, Frame Traps, punishing, Krushing Blows, safe and unsafe attacks, etc. You can even play a tutorial explaining a character of choice, their different moves and which are safe on blocks or unsafe on blocks. (Safe/unsafe meaning that you can/can't block after an attack while the enemy is blocking and ready to punish you)

The Story:
It can be very confusing if you are not familiar with the Mortal Kombat lore. Fortunately i informed myself about the story and was able to understand it. I have to say that the story was good but not perfect. It was a bit hard for me to get invested in the characters but that's probably because i never played the older Mortal Kombat games. It took me about 5-8 hours or so to complete the story.

Characters:
I really love the characters of this game. All of them have unique personalities and great lines when they are about to murder each other. My favorite one:
Kung Lao: ''We are not here to parlay, are we?''
Skarlet: ''I came to suck you dry''
Kung Lao: ''Skarlet, we hardly know each other!''

 Now stuff that i think are drastically dragging the game down:

Microtransactions:

The Kustomization: I'm not saying it's horrible but i think it lacks a few things. They should've brought the Injustice 2 customization system back. The best thing to do would've been to just scrap customization and bring the MKX system back (despite the fact that i haven't played MKX i think that the ''3 playstyle options'' were something good).

The Krypt:
The Krypt is an annoying grind. Opening chests with a chance to find something for your main(s) that doesn't look like dog shit. I think that they should've implemented a shop where you can buy the things you want for your main(s) and depending on the rarity of the item it would cost you more. And this would actually make the different currencies (4 currencies btw.? wtf? lul) useful. For different categories like Tower Consumables, augments, appearance, fatalities, taunts and brutalities you would have to pay with each of the currencies (one currency would be enough though). I know that there is a store but it is not as fleshed out as my suggestion and you need to buy a specific currency with real money to even buy something from that store.
All in all it sometimes can really feel like a shady mobile game but if you can bite the bullet and ignore it, you can have a great time with this game.

81,50317651,english,"[h1]Microtransaction complaints have been confused with the grind[/h1]
A lot of people making negative reviews about microtransactions seem to be misinformed. Right now you can buy 5 sets of skins (yes, cosmetics) and augmentations that make the fatalities easier to perform. The fatalities are already very easy to perform so you really do not need to purchase any of those augmentations and the 5 skins are in a rotation so they change every few hours. 

A majority of reviewers seem to be under the impression that you can pay X amount of in-game currency and unlock everything in the krypt. That's simply not true & not how it works. You [u][b]cant[/b][/u] buy koins (the currency used for opening chests and unlocking cosmetics) with real money. You can only buy krystals and those can only be used in the shop on either the 5 skins mentioned above or the fatality combo augments. You also earn krystals by just playing the game by the way. 

All of these skins can be unlocked by simply playing the game. You dont need to pay for any of it.

Would you have to grind for a very long time in order to unlock everything in the game? Yes, and that's what the critisism should be aimed at if people feel like that's an issue. Personally I dont think it's an issue at all. The reason why it would take such a long time to grind is because there's just so many cosmetics in the game. Each character has like ~20 skins so obviously it would take a long time to unlock all of it. Especially when the DLC characters get released later this year. The only cosmetics that I am interested in are the cosmetics for my main fighter.

The developers have responded to this critisism by saying they will give 500'000 koins to all players in the next patch which is nice since it will give people a lot of unlocks and eliminate how long the grind would be to unlock the rest of the cosmetics in the Krypt.

[h1]Do not buy the Frost DLC[/h1]
Now this is something people should complain about. You can buy the character Frost from their DLC list. What they do not tell you on the Steam page is that you unlock her by playing through the story. Not only that but you unlock her quite early in the story so there's no need to play through the entire story mode if you feel like that's boring. Why are they trying to charge people for something that everybody will unlock very early in the game anyway?

[h1]FPS issues & occasional crashes on PC[/h1][strike]
All the cutscenes, including the scenes for fatal blows and fatalities are locked to 30 fps. This makes it feel as if the game has got performance issues now and then but it's really just the artificial FPS limit at play. This, along with occasional crashes in the main menu, needs to be fixed ASAP.[/strike]

[b]FIXED![/b]

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
Each character feels unique and every fight is different because of each players unique fighting style. The background scenes are gorgeous and the animations are fluent and well made. There are a ton of game modes to choose between so if you're not in the mood to play PVP you could always try your luck in a timed tower or do a tag battle with a friend. 

The fatalities and brutalities are extremely gory and so over the top that they've made me laugh several times. As it should be. 

[h1]Online play[/h1]
No issues at all. Before each fight you are displayed with the enemy players ping, type of connection and win/loss ratio. You can then choose if you want to accept or reject that opponent. Say they have a high ping? Reject. Somebody with a very high win/loss ratio but on wireless? Reject. Good ping & balanced win/loss rate? Accept.

There's no in-game communication and that's probably a good thing. There would be a lot of toxicity if it was allowed.

Mk11 has some issues. The PC port can be a bit janky, the character selection is a little weird leaving out classics like Reptile or the Cyborgs (Sektor and Cyrax). The towers can be unfair at times and the microtransactions are plentiful.

But, apart from that, the good outweighs the bad IMO.

The fighting is buttery smooth, every character, even the less ""meta"" ones, feel good to play.  Hits are meaty, mechanics are simple to do but complex when you put them all together, giving the game an easy to play hard to master style of game.

The biggest thing for me is the connection, as in my nearly 100 hours I've never had a game-disrupting moment of lag.

[h1]Gameplay:[/h1]
Combos: are very short in this game, most of them consist of [Attack string-Special move-Enhance-Attack string-Special move]...that's it.

Sprinting: it got thanosed out of existence and that turns this game from fast paced (which is what mk is supposed to be) to slow as fuck, the only character that has a sprinting function is jade and it has 13 frames of recovery after spending a bar of meter... WHY??? you wanna approach your local cetrion zoner? lol good luck fam, by the time you reach her she has a 50% life lead.

Neutral: most people pick characters with insane projectiles aka cetrion cassie, if you are playing anything that cant spam back then after you close the gap your life bar will be crying from the abuse you received.

The fact that tier lists matter in this game more than ever, is fucking stupid, a B tier character has no chance against an S tier character skill doesn't even matter in this scenario unless the guy you are going up against has no idea what he is doing, Sonya has a built in 50 50 in her strings... wtf??? while kotal gets an extra 10% health, good job NetherRealm now he has 110% health you completely fixed him he got bumped from C tier to S very great.

It doesn't help that this game is so unstable, i get super frequent crashes and fps stutters its not even funny, NetherRealm don't seem to give a single fuck about pc players its just bad don't buy this game unless they fix it somehow in the near future.

Edit: i forgot to mention breakaways, who the fuck decided that this is a good idea????? if you are playing something like sonya or scorpion if an opponent breaks away as soon as you input your special move the recovery on your special move is so abysmal to the point he can combo you for free... ??????????????? where is the skill aspect??? good job netherrealm very great im proud of you",1569409839,1569665653,False,16,8,0.537571132183074951,1,True,False,False,76561198206500068,117,6,6128,0,5859,1591287733,,

I like this game because
 
it's Mortal Kombat and I have a lot of nostalgia for the series.
Krushing blows are fun to pull off and feel rewarding.
Brutalities are cool and I prefer them to fatalities for the most part.
The graphics are great and the controls feel good.
The new defence and offence meters are a good idea and a bit different to the other games out there. 
There is a good amount of defensive options when getting up off the ground.
The gear and customisation options are a good addition. I like that Sub Zero doesn't have to wear blue if you don't want him to and there is more variety in the colours and appearances of characters.
I'm happy Shang Tsung, Nightwolf and Sindel will be making a return.

I dislike this game because

Fatal blows and fatalities take far too long. Fatalities in particular add an extra 20 or so seconds to the end of a match which is already over. Fatalities used to be cool kind of mysterious kung fu techniques. Now they're just gory and boring.
There is so much grinding in this game it's ungodly.
Randomised treasure chests/loot boxes with no great rewards.
Some of the tower mechanics are just bad, blacking out my monitor or reversing my controls when I'm near an opponent isn't a fun or challenging stipulation to add to my matches. 
A lot of great moves and character variations aren't available when playing online ranked mode.

Online play

I'm in Australia and have limited experience online but from what I've played the connections aren't good overall. 
If your in the US or EU you may have a better experience.

I don't recommend this game.
I spend a lot of time on MK11 for the wrong reasons.

This is not the first time it happens, as this is the third MK game that Netherrealm has outsourced for a PC release.

Crashes and memory leaks also happen often. Every time they release a patch, it is a gamble to figure out if the game will play better or worse than it did, if it does at all.

If Netherrealm is going to put so little effort in their PC release, then very clearly Mortal Kombat does not belong here anymore.

- beautiful graphics;
- general gameplay;

- bugs, bugs, bugs - the worst is the one that turns off the game to the desktop when loading the first fight in the tower, after all fights in the tower or into crypts;
- no support from the developer - it's sad;
- re-passing the crypt (after filling the crates again) does not allow you to find valuable things (skins, bruttality, equipment) - disposable items are useless to me;

Irrelevant:
- microtransactions - they do not bother me and they are not at all necessary to undergo the game (or give yourself a greater chance in duels) - so I do not understand the lament of some people that this is a problem - I have never used microtransactions and will not use.

Everything looks like it's made out of plastic. Especially the characters. The blood effects look out of place. Oh, it's gory and violent alright and the fatalities are over the top as you would expect of a MK title but it looks like its still in alpha stage, as if the colour is missing. 

Towers of time is a waste of time as it doesn't really unlock anything useful and you have to wait for who knows for how long until you see something appears you like to have. 

The customization is not any better. All women are fully clothed and the selection is minuscule were you can only select different colours for them and that's it. So iconic clothing for Kitana or Jade are gone.  
The Krypt is the only decent part of the game. You can move freely around, solve some minor puzzles to unlock new areas and of course open chests in hope you get what you want. 

The training is by far the best. Not only it displayed my PS4 controller but it shows you what and when certain buttons need to pressed. And you can select ten button proms of moves and combos you like to learn, unlike in previous ones were you had to enter the commands, find the move you like to master and hope you can memorize it. This way it made it much easier to learn and master it efficiently.   

But that's where the good stuff ends for me. The fights are slow and don't feel as they have an impact. And again the stupid variations for each character. 
By far, the worst MK.",1568212233,1568212233,False,8,0,0.51320117712020874,0,True,False,False,76561197974105367,311,168,1057,0,825,1582296436,,

If you're someone that wants to play for ranked then I guess you should buy it but in no way is this better than MKX as some people say, at least not from my experience. Towers are pretty lame. The Dragon Challenges are annoying af and have no way of being disabled, it takes a bit to get used to them. If you want to just play for the story it's not that bad but even then you're paying basically 10‚Ç¨ for about 1 hour of gameplay. It just feels a lot worse than MKX imo and let's not forget the fact that the game was barely playable on pc for a long time. The characters are ok but some of the good ones are missing which is kind of annoying, but that could be said for many games.
Overall Towers and such will be annoying if you aren't a good fighting game player. Because some of the battles are so overbuffed that it's almost impossible unless you can manipulate timings agains almost every characcter perfeclty. Consumables or rather ''KONSUMABLES'' are one of the worst things that have been introduced imo and should never be a part of the game again. What's also bothering me is that they took away the X-rays and rather implemented ''Lethal Blows'' which aren't really lethal it's just some strong attack you can use when YOU, The user, gets low enough. And even then, they aren't that hard to block, for players or for AI. If I would be able to I WOULD refund the game, just out of the fact that towers are so boring, but that's a personal opinion. Overall, the game isn't as solid or as enjoyable as MKX was if you ask me.

38,55022324,english,"Short version:
-------------------
MK11 = Pink subzero VS blue scorpion VS yellow liukang VS green kunglao. Oh and forget about hot MK girls, NR is PC now.
There is nothing else really in this game apart from a boring story mode.

Actual Review:
--------------------

* Story Mode

Way too short, the story is not interesting and actually garbage, makes no sense and the whole thing just feels like it was created to showcase the brand new 'facial expressions' technology. The entire story is about showing the characters making faces, 99% of the time smiling like this is a comedy game or something.
Also, the story of characters is just utter nonsense. Some are just boring, but mostly it's not canon, contradicting a lot of past stories of characters or just outright made up to go well with what NR thinks is today's hot trends regardless of really making no sense.

* Towers

The traditional towers are boring and not very rewarding. It feels like a waste of time. Speaking of time, Time Towers is the alternative to the traditional, that you have to grind through billions of times to unlock all kinds of useless game content that are really not only useless, but again making no sense. Most of said contents are cosmetics such as you can have green scorpion, purple subzero, pink jade and yellow kitana, and you can have gear that are only in the game to help grind even more of these content. If grinding feels like your thing, than it's a good game. Most of the single player content beyond story mode feels like a chore.
You can even use AI fighter to clear the towers for you so you really don't even need to be at your computer to grind. I guess NR wanted to give people a game who don't actually like to play the game.

* Online

It's totally imbalanced, and boring. Most of the time you will see only scorpions / liu kangs / kung laos / noobs which is only 4 of the ever growing roster of 27 characters as of this writing. The only difference you will see is that the same characters come in all kinds of colors that make no sense. Why would you want to have a red subzero or a green kitana? Makes no sense.
Whatever is your main, you always have to lose millions of times against the same cheap overpowered scorpions, because ed boon said so, and you will have to watch EVO, where sonicfox will tell the entire player base which character is hot, and then you will have to face that one or two characters 99% of the time online because of the real fanboyness and brandwagon players.
It's totally boring and toxic, so if you want to preserve your sanity, don't play online.

On top of online play, there is a regular kombat league as well, that's basically the same as above with a ranking system. Now for what purpose the ranking system was implemented is another question. First of all, the players can easily find themselves against players from other ranks. If this alone isn't enough, the matchmaker can calculate you the odds of winning as well as the network speed of both players. These information is just cosmetics though to fill your screen because said matchmaker doesn't even care about fairness. You have 0% chance to win? no problem, just stick with the lose. You have to face an opponent with red ping? no problem, you will have to play with epic latency, and if the connection ever breaks you earn a loss, because it's totally your fault that you have been matched up against someone playing with an 56k connection. Also, there is a point decay, so if you don't play for 3 days you lose your hard earned points, which is yet another thing that makes the game feel like a chore.

* The Krypt

As much as I love the relaxing / chilling atmosphere of all the island you can discover now in 3rd person mode and see the places where the previous MK games were played, it's the most epic chore of all times. The chests are super expensive, you need 3 different kinds of currency, you even need to obtain special items, some are via crafting only to get concept arts and purple subzero skins. If this were a separate game with all currency actually coming from playing the krypt alone it would be a lot more fun the the rest of MK11 currently is.

* The interface

Not sure about other platforms, but on PC the GUI is broken. The mouse works only half of the time and it's random, the keyboard
inputs randomly disappear in void, the game crashes when certain buttons clicked in specific order, the mouse can completely stop working and you have to restart the game to make it work again.

* Fight mechanics

Not much to say here, apart from the characters that are decided to be the EZ win ones, life will be a misery. The fight itself is much slower than any of the previous ones were before, except for the said OP characters, they are just overly fast and have cheesy one-button 100000% damage combos. The rest of the characters actually require skill and learning time, but 99% of player base will not touch them, which makes the game extremely one-dimensional. On top of that, the game has krushing blows and fatal blows now, which are needlessly long slow mo cutscenes that interrupt the flow of the game way too often and they are always the same, so after the first 100 fights (which you already have after story mode) you will have already seen and got bored of all of them. Get ready to watch them a few million times more.
These are high damaging moves, which wouldn't be a problem, but every characters have different number of them with different triggers, and apart from the above mentioned select few who have it in every one of their basic strings and can krushing blow you 3 times in a single kombo, there are others that only have 2 of which only 1 is realistically useable (raiden). This mechanics further increases the imbalance of the game. Actually, even fatal blows (previously x-ray moves) deal different amount of damage and some characters can trigger it from full screen while others have hard conditions for it. Little bit unfair..

Summary:
If you manage to get the game for free, play it. It offers some good fun at the beginning (like in the first 5 hours or so), after that it's a toxic, boring grind and you are better off playing something else. If you played any of the previous MK games (like ANY from MK1 up to MKX) then this game will most probably be a dissapointment.",1567963794,1567963794,False,16,2,0.525776207447052002,4,True,False,False,76561198010437803,45,4,12008,0,9717,1584265128,,

40,50479819,english,"I think MK11 is a great game in terms of gameplay, cool new mechanics, characters and more.
However it seems like the developers does not care about the PC version.
In this review I am not going to talk about the Krypt or the unlockables because I dont really care about them, I want to focus
on the game itself.

Honestly, why even bother releasing a PC version if it looks like it.
I feel like after every patch they release they break the game even more.

- The game constantly lags and disconnects on ""Green ping"" which makes the game's online gameplay very broken and unenjoyable mostly because of the lags, its to the point where its really just unplayable sometimes.

- Bad optimization, sometimes the game runs on the highest quality on 60 FPS and sometimes It stuck at 30 - 40 FPS
on the lowest quality, which is really bad for a game that built on frame data.

- Exploits that can be used online, for example: If you loose the first match of a ""Ranked set""  you can just do nothing and
wait for the opponent to leave out of no choice (Winning) , because the game does nothing even after the timer rans out, and you cant even report the player.

-The game just breaks after every patch, after the Shang Tsung update the game couldnt finish one game online before getting desynced, causeing the online session to just be canceld even you won already.
It got only worse... after the ""Balance patch"" the game just didnt luched at all until I found a fix after like two weeks or so.

-Sometimes I feel like the game just ignores my input, like I can barely preform a breakaway, roll or a throw escape. I think this problem comes with the lag problem, but still I belive its worth to bring up.

Overall MK11 is a good fighting game, one of the best out right now, but I will not recommand getting it on PC because the PC version is really bad compared to the console version, and the fact the developers does not care at all about it should warn you to stay away from the PC version for now, I still hope things will be different in the futrue.

Thanks for reading.

48,54950358,english,"I jokingly call MK11 Street Kombat 11 as the slower pace and focus on footsies (moving back and forth with your character with a focus on spacing in order to line up an attack or cause opponent to wiff thus setting up a free counter attack/combo) reminds me a bit of the pacing of The Street Fighter series which I admittedly do not play much of. Many people's taste prefer the combo heavy, rush down, offense minded approach to MKX, but I do NOT. MK2 is the best of the pre MK9 Mortal Kombats in my humble opinion. It was a slower not slow fighter, focused on spacing and setting up your opponent for attacks and special moves which is what MK11 is trying to recapture, their words not mine and I love it! 

MK2 had no dial-a-combos that I recall and MK11 was, at first, especially during it's beta, getting critisized heavily for lacking combos (for that and for bending the knee to SJW weirdos). I am glad to report that after playing everyday on either PS4 Pro or XB1X there are tons of combos per character that can be linked to krushing blows and fatal blows for some big time, match stealing damage.

Why don't I play on PC as much as on console, you might ask? The graphics look way better on console than they do on PC. I know! Sounds insane and many may disagree, but to me the difference is jarring and obvious. The major problem is the lighting. It looks way too bright and after messing with the settings something else will just look bad. Too dark, or the contrast will be off. I won't knock any points off because of this as it might just be my taste here.

That's all I wanted to say. The game is great! Microtransactions are barely even noticeable. It's not in your face and the skins you buy can be earned in game... so far! If you like fighting games this is as Triple-A as they get in the gaming industry. It is of the highest quality. Lastly, the over priced krypt boxes were fixed days in so that is all I will say about that.

Get ready to forfeit half your victories due to the vaste quantity of broken features complacently left around by NRS at the disposal of any moron who can and will abuse these in order to manipulate their winrate.

DDoS, lagswitch, infinite in between round timer, and that's not even taking into account the ludicrous balance which leaves more than half of the roster completely useless for competition.

With a patch every 5 months at best, and delayed on PC because apparently f*ck PC, this has to be one of my worst online experience in about 3 decades of gaming.
And when you finally get an actual match going, desyncs.

Latency ? NRS in their immense generosity allows you to decline games as long as they go above 151ms.
WiFi 150ms ? Nope, endure it.
Worst, you will quickly notice that the ping displayed during matchmaking ends up 100% OF THE TIME being at least 30ms more in game. 80ms matchmaking = 110 to 160ms in game.
This is obvious manipulation to force players to believe it's better than it actually is.

I won't detail the Krypt model, suffice to say it's a snoozefest of random lootbox ultragrind with a poorly optimized exploration skin slapped on it, designed to send you right to the cash shop.
Actually let me detail for a second, you can reset the lootboxes (yes, lootboxes, not chests) by throwing all your in game money at it, but of course the game fails to mention that's only going to get you crafting materials. You didn't know ? Aww.

And of course the final nail in the coffin, typical modern gender hypocrisy, because women showing skin is unrealistic and immature, whereas half naked muscular guys and people blowing their brains off just to get back up a second later is indeed totally realistic and mature.
Obvious political pandering to some weird audiences who, let me tell you NRS, don't give a flying f*ck about buying an MK game to start with.

I rarely go out of my way to criticize hard work (and even despites the weird political agenda the new designs actually look good), because it's certain a lot of people worked their ass off to make this game, but NRS management and decision making is pathetic and unforgivable.

Pros 
A lot of remeberable charectars
Good story
Good mechanics 
A great tutorial for beginers and masters alike 
My favorite part the Krypt

Cons 
The game is super laggy (60fps mode is like 10fps mode)
No integraty (a lot of the replays you see online are cheaters)
A lot of cheaters
Really slow paced compared to other games in the series 
Fatal blows are dumb and an easy way to clutch wins.
The load screens take me 5-7 minutes and i have a high spec computer
AI battles are all the same (noob saibot/ sonya blade/ baraka)
Multiplayer is super laggy
Towers are still kinda stupid
DLC charecters are super hard to get new skins and you have to play charecter towers to do get the skins.

This game has a lot of potental to be a great game. Every update just adds another bug or issue to the game. DLC is ok, and the online is barely playable.

63,54810886,english,"What was an awesome and interesting continuation of one of the more popular fighting games to have a storyline in MKX got wrecked and pissed on with 11. This game is a joke from that perspective but that's where the problems begin for this game. The plot makes no sense. It shouldn't need to. But, if you revolutionize fighting games with the likes of Injustice 1 and 2 and MK9 with a top tier story mode and this is what you deliver then you failed. Sorry. On to the other stuff.

People are throwing around the word loot box and microtransaction for this game. Ignore that. There's no need to spend a dollar more. I promise. Items will pop up for sale that you can buy but this is only to get a cosmetic item for a character quickly without slogging through the grindfest of the Towers of Time and the Krypt. Speaking of the Krypt. Confusing. Repulsive. Aggravating. I get the concept. Build a world to explore while also giving players a chance to earn cosmetics and finishing moves for fighters. Cool. It sucks. It's locking items behind puzzles and a gameplay mode that doesn't involve fighting...in a fighting game. You'll wish this game had actual lootboxes to avoid this crap. Speaking of fighting...

Weird choices were made. You can choose loadouts for fighters now which allow you to use different special moves and tailor the characters to fit your style best. However, if you want to play ranked you are locked in to 2 variations(a third will be unlocked at some point). These variations put a hefty tier gap on characters and take a lot of the fun out of some of them. Then, while actually fighting, issues pop up with damage falloff and hit boxes(these issues aren't bugs, mind you). Some animations go low and will count as mid or high, larger combos don't necessarily mean bigger damage and Fatal Blows are looooooooonnnnnnnngggggg repetitive moves that can be activated regardless of meter, meaning you get to see two of these mini cutscenes twice a match. Yay. X ray moves are unlocked by performing certain actions during a match, meaning that you may have to play a certain way to perform some of the best combos for your character. This is nice if this alread aligns with how you play. Sucks if you don't.

And for the love of Raiden, why introduce a storyline that has past and present versions of characters and the intro dialogues not recognize which is which. It's stupid watching older Johnny Cage complaining about his older version, to his older version for example.

64,54806299,english,"Thoughts: 

Graphics- looks good, when it isn't flickering or having frame rate issues. 

The levels look great- easily one of the best level sets in Mortal Kombat- if only they brought back some of the older stages with this same level of detail. 

The character models are top-notch. I might not like some of them, but there's no denying the effort that went into so many of them. I'm pleased that they did so well with the faces, although there are a couple characters that could use a touching up. (For example, Kitana's nose area just looks dirty and her mouth when she talks seems off. Which leads me to:  

Animation- during the fights, looks fantastic. Very smooth. But their cinematics feel like they are done by two different people- one really good that helps you feel the emotion, and the other that goes through the motions. 

Audio- very high standard as many of the recent Mortal Kombat games have been. No complaints here. 

Story- it's crap. So much potential for developing characters that was left untouched. A lot of things left unexplained. Some characters had little to no reason to be there (some of the new characters, I'm looking at them- Cetrion and the Collector were disappointing), and some were just the typical 'show up to beat down' characters. The story was also short, played through in a day. For a game studio like Netherrealm Studios- I expected better. The framework of the story is there. But it's only half-written, in my opinion. 

Speaking of expecting better- the final boss fight- when will Netherrealm get it through their heads that the final boss fight mechanics don't have to be unreasonably fair to casual players? I've never been good at fighting games on a level where I'll have endless strings of combos or the ability to play on a pro level. It's just not going to happen no matter how much I play. (So if the response is 'git gud' or some idiotic nonsense like that, that might work for those trying to play at a pro level, not someone casual like myself.) So why is the boss so stupidly difficult? To be fair, I think most fighting game studios do have this issue where the final boss is extremely difficult, but NRS has had many MANY opportunities to make them better. 

Social issues- games are a product of their time. I'm not a huge fan of little bits of politics being brought into the game, but it's not ridiculous to the point where it seriously detracts from the game. I have no issues with any of the character models outfits- I personally don't feel Mortal Kombat women need to be dressed like strippers to be sexy. Then again, I'm married and older, so I've got a different perspective than most people probably do. No points given or taken here- it is what it is. 

Towers of Time- not a fan. The mechanic of using random loot to handle a tower (when you may or may not have said loot to begin with) is pointless and annoying. This is a bastardization of the old Towers of Luck, which were just fine on their own. Yet being forced to play this mode for unlocks? I suppose it is what it is, but it's not fun. 

Speaking of not fun- why are there AI players? Is this for the parts where the towers are simply too much and I have to turn it over to the computer? 

Ultimately though, you want to know if this is worth the money. If you are a hardcore fighting game fan, yes. This is well crafted and you won't be playing it for the story. For a casual player, I'd wait until it goes on sale as a Komplete edition. I wanted to like this game, but I feel like this is made for professional players on a higher level than myself.

68,54790901,english,"The game is ok. I feel like this is a downgrade in the sense that the game feels slow, combos are very repetitive, i feel its not as intense as MKX. Story is exceptional, fun and interesting. Graphics are amazing and the tutorial mode was sent from the gods of fighting games. DLC Characters are really solid. The new mechanics they added to the games are really cool, its a nice twist.  All the characters feel solid, the move list is not as huge as Tekken 7 but its divers enough. Its responsive overall its feel really good once you start playing and the customization is awesome but is a grind to get anything you like cosmetic wise. Characters have a ton of skins but really there are only 3 or 4 good ones everything else is just color swaps. You have to grind and grind and grind to get hearts and koins and soul fragments from the towers of time to use for the krypt( lootboxes) .

Everything in the krypt is random, good luck getting anything you want. Once you complete the krypt you have to go and restock it again and again. There is a mini slot machine called The Shrine to get exclusive gear which is horrible honestly unless you get lucky. To get to the Throne Room you need to do 50 fatalities on each of the fighters go get their head to be able to access the throne room which is more grinding. On top of that the Gauntlet which is found in the towers of time is borderline impossible due to the modifiers they are straight up just bullshit. You can buy currency called time crystals which are also earned (very slowly) in game to buy content that is IN THE GAME which is on a timer there is new stuff for sale every certain amount of time. Also they are trying to sell you Frost for $5 bucks, the infuriating part of it is that you can unlock her by playing the story and its not really that far into the story. Above all that it crashes on me for no reason... its really frustrating

Also in towers you can select the AI to play for you the annoying part is you need to press continue after every match.

though of course there are some issues particularly in the story.
for example some characters are not at all developed like the should have been... like Erron Black, Noob and D'vorah (Geras had some room too)
also Jax's story seemed to be forced into the storyline with NO real significance. And also it's very unlike him to side with Kronika for such a stupid reason and turn back just as stupidly! like what changed that made him turn back?!! Raiden's speech?! Is he that gullible to turn and turn back with Kronika's promise and and Raiden's morality lessons and not listen to his own daughter?!
(sidenote: considering Jax's tower ending... it feels like they wanted to make the black character seem more important than he was supposed to be (in THIS particular game and not the whole franchise! yeah Jax is super old and important but his storyline didn't fit that's all!))
Also why don't we get a decent backstory for D'vorah?!
Overall the fighting mechanics are great and need a good bit of mastering.
the thing I hate the MOST about this game is fucking Scorpion and Sub-Zero!!
You just can't play against them!! For the love of God change the way they work!
Also some other things... why remove character's hats or masks or helmets or whatever in fatalities and fatal blows?!?! It's actually a big deal I think! We've never seen what was behind Shao Kahn's helmet and that is important to his badassness! why would you ever remove kitana's mask?! You should not be able to see Noob Saibot's face!!!

76,54727818,english,"MK11 is an amazing game its some of the most fun i have had in a while

Whats Good:
The in game tutorial is very good teaches you every thing from low and overhead attacks all the way to frame data.

the story mode is once again very good NRS knows how to make a very enjoyable story it felt like i was watching a movie but parts of the story suffers from mediocre writing and characters doing stupid shit only because of plot purposes.

There is alot more single player content in this game then in MK9 you of course have the story mode and your classic towers but you also have the new Towers Of Time which are 7 platforms which change on an hourly/weekly basis with new rewards so every time you play there is always something new.

The new cosmetic system is very cool each fighter has around 60 skins (although there is really only 4 or 5 the rest are all pallet swaps of the 4-5 skins) along with that each fighter gets 3 gear slot where they can change different well gear on their fighter what it is exactly depends on the figher For example with Scorpion you can change his Mask, Katana and Spear i love this because not every character looks exactly the same.

the Graphics looks amazing i cant believe this is the same engine they made MK9 on the detail in this game is unrivaled all the Stages, Characters, fatalities and moves look amazing definitely a 10/10 in the graphics section.

Performance is very good solid 60 FPS for me on high graphics.

and most importantly the gameplay it is amazing the game is very fun. playing online matches are the most intense shit ever and i love that. it is feels very rewarding to get a good read or pull of a difficult combo. Gameplay is definitely a solid 9/10

Whats Bad:

Grinding for cosmetics for me its not that big of an issue but depending on the character you play and how much time you have on your hands getting that one mask or one outfit for you main can be a pain in the ass. again how difficult it is to get said mask/outfit varies based on how you obtain it and what character your playing.

AI battles should not be a fucking thing why is it that in order to get a cosmetic i need to watch the AI play the game i want to play the game i want to grind for cosmetics not the AI and if you win an AI battle there is a very small chance you will get the cosmetic you want.

Character imbalance: some characters breathe and your health bar disappears. some characters are just way better/easier than others and the worst thing that comes from this is the fact that all you come across online is whoever the sub reddit deems OP that week.

we are almost their folks: now last under my complaints is the micro transactions/DLC and oh boy where to start. First the game is 60 USD currently to get the kombat pass or season pass 1 thats right there will be more than one season pass is 40 USD and you dont get Shao kahn with that kombat pack so to get him there is 6 USD gone. and since it has been leaked   that there will be a second Kombat pack we can guess that will be 40 USD so basic math tells us that you will pay 86 USD if you buy the both kombat packs and  Shao Kahn that is more than the game its self.

Continuation from the last paragraph: now of course you can buy all the fighters individually and just buy the ones you want and end up spending less than that but still that previously mentioned 86 dollars of DLC needs to be mentioned.

The premium shop is an in game shop that lets you use time crystals to purchase intros, victory poses, brutalities, Gear and outfits time crystals are earned by leveling up or doing stuff in the towers of time, but you can also buy them for real life money so when your out of time crystals and that one cosmetic you have been trying to get for so long appears in the shop for 24 hours we all know what WB wants you to do.


And that is all folks if you made it this far thank you for reading my review :) there are also stuff like bugs in this game but non of them are game breaking and dont effect the score.

Final Score: 8/10

82,54692686,english,"This is the first time I write a review on a steam game in English but it's from the bottom of my heart.

After thinking twice, I decided to give a thumb down, here are some reasons:

1.	First of all, I want to talk about my major game experience in MK 11 as a fighting game on PC. This means I am not going to talk about cosmetics, krypt, story, tower and all that stuff in this part, just pure rank fighting experience. I'm a Johnny main and I struggled my way to demi-god in the season of blood (since Johnny is relatively weak). But in season of time I gave up. Because from grandmaster to demi-god I kept fighting the same group of people again and again and over again and that just made me think ''how many people are there playing on PC?'' Let's not talk about this in a minute. Most of the people I got matched up with were using characters like scorpion, geras and Liu Kang to kick my ass. What I mean by ‚Äòkick my ass‚Äô is they have really powerful 5050s and staggers and zoning among other things. And you know what? I am good with that. But I am not good with a system called crushing blow. This crushing blow thing just made the game not fun, unbalanced and frustrating (at least for me). And that frustration became more inevitable when you decided to play the game to the next level. Why even have crushing blow? To make the game more violent by messing up with the game balance? I don‚Äôt understand. Wouldn‚Äôt it be better to have those bones-breaking scenes during a fatal blow just like MKX did? (Sometimes I really want to know why Sonya‚Äôs fireball have a crushing blow on the second mid hit enhanced while Johnny does not, not to mention the second hit is also a high.) Everyone were excited about this newly introduced system by the launch of the game, so was I, but it became frustration when it came to hardcore gameplay. I once tried scorpion, and I felt I was playing a different game. I know if I switch to a different character the game is going be easier, but I won‚Äôt. Because I love Johnny and that‚Äôs all it matters. In my opinion, I don‚Äôt expect Johnny to get some good accessible crushing blows. I just want the crushing blow system to be COMPLETELY REMOVED from the rank play. 

Another issue is the hitbox. Johnny‚Äôs 121 string was said to be fixed during the balance patch stream but I found that was not the case. They only fixed the second hit. The first hit of 121 string (a high attack) always whiffs whether the opponent is blocking or not as long as they are crouching. And I tested other characters‚Äô 1. Some whiffs and some do not. Johnny‚Äôs fireball still whiffs on a lot of characters (mostly female) after his strings.

I also want to talk about fatal blow, which is another thing that I think was not implemented very well. Overall the fatal blows are okay, like the requirement and damage dealt, but the start-ups of some FBs are fast and some are slow which results in unbalance and late game mind games. There were a lot of situations where both players were below 30 percent health and had fatal blows ready to go and both players just wanted to smash the fatal blows to see if they can hit. I mean this is a fighting game. This is not supposed to happen. Compared to Street Fighter V, there is an animation before every critical art (the fatal blow in Street Fighter V), so you have time to react to it. You could either jump or block. So, people mostly use critical art to extend damage after a confirm, not to smash it randomly. Back to MK 11, even though I think combo FB after confirm is the right way to use it but some fatal blows are just too fast to react and there is so much frustration after the hit or being punished. Another issue with the fatal blow is that the damage increasing and damage reducing during the fatal blow. I am pretty sure a lot of people don‚Äôt know what I am talking about and isn‚Äôt this the issue about it? You can press a button at the right timing of each hit to increasing the damage if you are fatal blowing or reduce the damage if you are being fatal blown. I did some research online but after 200+ hour playtime I still don‚Äôt know what button to press on my mechanical keyboard. I don‚Äôt know if it is in the tutorial because I didn‚Äôt finish it. I simply think this button-pressing thing should not exist during a fatal blow.

2.	Okay, now the second problem. On PC, this game just cannot seem to absorb and keep new players. At the beginning of August, I tried to introduce my friend to this game (he bought Street Fighter V and MK 11 at the same time). He also plays on PC and was completely new to fighting games so I wanted to find some rookie lobbies to have some fun with him. My friend and I were both kind of hardcore, which means we bought MK 11 not for fatalities and cosmetics stuff but to fight. This was still clear to my memory, on a certain night around 8pm (Eastern Daylight Time), there were only THREE lobbies with people. Two with two people fighting and one with one person (probably afk). I WASN‚ÄôT going to make a new lobby for my friend because I knew that no one will come, let alone rookies. So, I tried to find a rookie lobby directly through King of Hill. But not surprisingly, I kept entering a lobby with 4-5 people, each around level 60. Eventually we played SFV because SFV had many rookie lobbies among other. My friend just can‚Äôt enjoy himself in MK 11. I think back then I was still pumped probably because of the launch of season of time (also the reason why I wanted to bring my friend), but all of the excitement turned into grief at that night. 

Why cannot we have cross-play? I know some people on PS4 or XBOX will say that a bunch of hackers on PC will ruin their experiences if crossplay exists, but I want to say that I also play Street Fighter V which has crossplay and among the 250 hour playtime I did not see a single hacker, so in the 200+ hour playtime on MK 11. Why cannot MK 11 have cross-play just like SFV does? Of course, non-existence of cross-play is not one of the reasons I gave a thumb down but this caused the reason I gave thumb down. Also, keeping matching up with the same group of people in Kombat league just made me feel this game was dead and hollow on PC.

87,54622861,english,"I guess how you feel about this game depends on whats important to you in your playing experience. There was a time when the Krpyt, a zillion different skins, and online-only rotating towers with unlockables didn't exist in Mortal Kombat (or in any games at all) so I tend to think of those features as just added bonuses but certainly not essential for me to be able to enjoy the game. If you center the majority of your gaming experience around these features though, you're probably going to be annoyed with the way the system is set up.

The core gameplay (ie. the fighting) is excellent. The characters looks great. The stage design is probably the best of the 3 modern Mortal Kombat titles. As much as people seem to dislike the Krpyt, I definitely appreciate all the references to the early games and original movie. As someone who was lucky enough to grow up with Mortal Kombat in the arcades, I am confident that if anyone in those arcades could have seen into the future at what this franchise was going to look like or how it was going to play that their minds would have been blown (mine included).",1565833548,1566196847,True,8,1,0.576118767261505127,0,True,False,False,76561198064473306,305,9,7195,0,3777,1591330468,,

[*]Great single player fighting game with tons of variety and replay value
[*]Business model is getting undeserved hate for cosmetic unlocks being random
[*]Performance issues may kill your fun

Pros
[list]
    [*]Story mode is great
    [*]One of the best tutorials for a fighting game
    [*]Tons of single player content between story, the challenge mode called ""towers of time"", and classic towers
    [*]Tons of cosmetic unlockables. Like ~50+ skins per character and then ~20+ skins per each of the 3 pieces of equipment each character has. Get ready to play lots of dress up. Despite the rage you'll see in the reviews, I've found these cosmetics to be unlocked at a pretty steady rate and I really don't [i]need[/i] any of them to enjoy the game since they don't alter gameplay.
   [*]You can create your own character builds by picking which abilities this build will have
   [*]Tons of replay value if you enjoy playing against the AI
[*]I love the new meter system. Fatal blows are entirely separate from your meter which is now broken into two distinct meters for offense and defense. Meters also slowly recharge so you don't feel like you have to save it for the perfect moment. I hope more fighting games adopt this system.
[/list]

Cons
[list]
[*]Performance issues. No matter what I try, i can't play this game with the 60 fps cut scenes and fatal blows on my main gaming pc and I sometimes get random drops. I have an i7 4770k, GTX 1080, and 16 GB of RAM which the game's autoconfig sets the graphics to be maxed out. That being said, my much lower powered laptop has had no issues. Your mileage may vary.
[*]I'm indifferent on the unlock system being random but I just kinda hate having to wander around the Krypt to unlock things and historically, I always have for MK games. I bought a fighting game. Just let me fight people. Wandering around and doing light puzzle solving is not why I bought the game.
[*]No dedicated tag-team tower despite this being built into the game's mechanics for select limited time towers. Please NRS! Add this as a dedicated mode! I miss playing MK co-op with my friends!
[/list]

Neutral:
[list]
[*]Your second fatality is locked for each character but performing it once will unlock it without having to find it in the crypt. I found this to be a little annoying but easily fixed by googling how to do it for a one time unlock.
[*]I'm not great at MK but I really enjoy playing it. Like with most fighting games, I tried playing online and got my ass handed to me every match. Online seemed to work well for me but I have only played about 5 or 6 matches. The unlocks you get for the ranked seasons look sweet though.

7,54564085,english,"Mortal Kombat 11 is a game, that I can honestly recommend to everyone. No matter you are young, old, pretty or ugly - you WILL find something in this game for you. Game is divided into two basic game modes: single and multiplayer.

Singleplayer:
In this mode you have many interesting options: you can play in practice (dojo) mode, or you can do towers. Towers are tall or small. Some of them are klassic, while others are not. Some are even time towers, while other are not time towers. That's cool. In non-classic towers you have normal non-classic towers and special non-classic towers, like character towers or gauntlet towers. All these towers are there for you.
You also have Krypt, and this is the place for people who like to grind and unlock things. Very good grind and unlocks there, many hours before you, even after unfortunate nerf from developers (they lowered anyway pretty low requirements for unlocking things, bastards).

Multiplayer (pvp):
This gamemode is basically for people, who likes Scorpion. If you are Scorpion player (I'm not), you will be pleased, because you have advantage in every online match. If you are not a Scorpion player (like me), you will be pleased too, because you may meet many very good Scorpion players online. They are good, because they can teleport themselves, which is cool, especially when you have lag. Suprise! And if you, accidentally, meet someone who don't play Scorpion, after your first match won in a Set, they will switch to Scorpion, so you will be pleased nevertheless.

Multiplayer (AI):
You can send you AI fighers to kombat. That's cool, especially if you like Noob Saibot. Trust me, get Noob Saibot, set him for max combos, and you will thank me later. Big fun, good mode.

-----------------

OK guys, now some serious words:
- this game has great visuals, clean, crispy graphic, without all these stupid explosions on-hit like in Street Figter etc.
- this game has great and (in general) balanced fighting system, this is SUPERB game to play with your friends offline, this is also probably the best Netherrealm tournament game,
- this game has much better netcode than previous games, but still this netcode has problems, and in games like this, when sometimes miliseconds decides... well it's not that good - just be warned
- this game has occasionally fps drops (even in menus)
- still, you can play online (Kombat League), just be prepared for a mthfckers who play Scorpion and exploit his teleport + lag, to win in nearly every situation. Generally speaking, 2/3 of players plays Scorpion or Noob Saibot - just be warned
- the offline mode is very good in my opinion, the basic goal is to unlock skins and gear, and gain currency for the Krypt, so if you don't like grind - just be warned

21,54496094,english,"This is just painful to play. People are saying to play it as it is and not compare it to MKX. Well, that's not happening because this was supposed to be a continuation on MKX's story.

* Dialogue - dreadful. It's so stiff and the only emotion you hear is when someone is getting a blade through their eyes.

* Characters - What. The. Hell. Happened!? It has only been 2 years, and the very next game. You couldn't have taken the assets from MKX and given them a little update? NONE of the characters look the same. Cassie and Jaqui look younger than they did in X, Raiden looks like he's be hiding all of the snack cakes in his cheeks, Johnny Cage now has a dad-bod with a racially stereotypical Italian nose, Kortal Khan got a boob job and a race change (he's white af except his blue face).

* Clothing - I would believe that NRS outsourced Full sail undergrads to handle character dress before I'd believe that a full blown studio created this lackluster look. Its almost like they modeled random humans, then put them in Mortal Kombat cosplay.

* Cutscenes - there's a lot of dialogue. A lot. The banter between heroes and villains is stiff and it doesn't feel like it flows right, like it doesn't feel like a natural conversation. The cutscene quality has dropped the ball compared to MKX's active scenes along with it's dark and gritty undertones. Instead, a lot of scenes looked like they recorded live extras running around and superimposed them over a CGI world. At least in MKX the cutscenes were interactive and the visuals made you feel appropriate emotions - despair, hope, sadness, and loss.

* UI - What is with this cartoony looking UI now? Even the menus are low budget cards flipping around to make your choice. The Healthbars looks like something from MK3 in the arcades. 

After almost 2 hours of constant let down and disappointment, I've had enough. I expected this game to be at least on par with MKX, not with MK: Armageddon.

23,54494062,english,"This game on launch was a lot of fun. There were bugs and very annoying aspects to this game when first released, but the core gameplay and difficulty and actual reward of playing was excellent. Before the first major patch, all I really wanted changed was that bosses in ladders couldn't spam their modifiers as hard as they did back then (which was about every 2 seconds). 

Compared to everyone else, I enjoyed the grinding you had to do to earn skins and cosmetics for your character because there isn't much single player content in this game to begin with and it actually gave you a REASON to play the game. In this case you would fight someone online and they would see a cool skin and think to themselves, ""Damn, that guy has a cool skin and must play a lot"". 

But the reason to grind and practice to fight towers was soon to come to an end. Sadly, it turns out that the majority of people who bought this game actually didn't really want to play it. Everywhere and anywhere anyone could post a comment there were thousands of comments saying: ""Do you think I want to play the towers to unlock the items!!! Just give me all of the items so when I play when I have the coolest items and the sweetest cosmetics without having to play this fucking game!!!!!!"" 

These people are actually sad. The devs made this game so that there was a reason to actually play and progress through the towers of time, as these towers each had different difficulties and the super cool items were usually restricted to the really good player or the ones who put in the time to actually play the game. 

Sadly though, with the support of all of the low IQ individuals who bought this game without wanting to play, this aspect of the game got reworked. 

After the first or second patch, the tower difficulty became laughable, so all of the no skill morons could obtain all of their skins LITERALLY WITHOUT EVEN PLAYING THE GAME! I mean this because now you can go into 4 out of 5 towers and just set an AI character to play the WHOLE TOWER FOR YOU. Seriously, you don't even need to touch anything during a fight and the AI will just win the items and currency for you. AND YET THERE ARE STILL COMMENTS AND REVIEWS SAYING IT IS TOO MUCH OF A GRIND. 

It is ironic how such a tough, bloody, hardcore fighting game somehow attracted the biggest sensitive man-children to come and complain about having to actually play the fucking game. 

Overall do not buy this game if you either want a challenge or want to actually play the game. This game used to be really fun, and really rewarded the players who put the time into the game to be able to beat a couple of tough computer AI, none the less players.

The game is overall great. The Gameplay is amazing, but the micro-transactions are kind of an annoyance to some people including me but they are optional so i can't complain about most of them except for Frost because why make people buy a character if you could get them FOR FREE in the actual game itself. The customisation is pretty limited compared to Injustice 2 which is rather disappointing since Injustice 2 had WAY more customisation for your gear and costumes. The story mode is not that good in my opinion since there is a lot of inconsistent plot armour, and the deaths for each character that died in the story won't matter since there will be a reboot to the series. The DLC is good so far, Shang Tsung plays well and might be the most interesting character from the MK universe in the game, and Nightwolf looks great so far even before release. Now let's get to the Krypt, and i have to say that the Krypt is FUCKING BULLSHIT! Like why the hell would they randomise every single fucking chest in the Krypt, and with all of the currencies in the game the grind becomes so goddamn tedious and long especially since they gimped how many koins you get no matter what the difficulty you are playing on, so now Players are exploiting the AI feature on endless mode to make the grind a bit quicker but not by much.

28,54446052,english,"Game balance feels off to me. They've tried to make it so that characters are based around either have a low or overhead launcher and then a less damaging combo on the other option. But all this does is turn fighting into guessing how greedy your opponent is. Crouch jab is too powerful online, and makes the game feel 'spreadsheety' as there is always an optimal path from every situation that leads to said 50/50. The game has too many defensive options now and punishes characters that have to fight for every opportunity to get in. Without having to earn your meter the game loses part of what made it work back in X, as even if you punish someone for using their meter stupidly they'll basically have it back by the time your combo ends. 

I skipped playing injustice 2 so all of the microtransactions and cosmetic items that have been added seem to ask the question, would you rather waste your time or your cash? This game has made me lose interest in the MK series and i don't think i shall be returning to this game or series unless a guest character that interests me is added later on.

52,54307247,english,"Great game with some questionable game design decisions 

Im writing this review playing since its release with over 200hours in counting of playtime. This review is for the gamers who want to know what this game brings and to help shed light on mixed reviews from people writing a 10min - 2 hour playtime review or from biased reviews made by hardcore fans. This game has made massive talking points from the fight mechanics to the politics. I plan to make an in depth review to cry out my critic and be heard by gamers and NRS developers to help better the gaming experience.

SUMMARY (scroll below if you want to see some mechanics and the common good and bad opinions that i've added and common things that the community talks about)
in summary I like the game would recommend especially with friends I commend it from its astounding graphics unparalleled from other fighting games, complete from the story to the multiple arcade ladders, the change of pace of fight mechanics and the banter of each character. however if you plan to buy for the story i would suggest not to do so as it isnt worth the ride. The game customization is okay but riddled with frustrating grind mechanics. The game has something for the pros and kasual players however enjoyment from it will vary.

Change in fight mechanics 
NRS took a big risk to change the fighting mechanics especially considering a lot of people liked mortal kombat x gameplay. personally i do like the change with a few exceptions and i do wish they make changes in the future
Krushing Blows - needs a balance patch some requirements are to hard/easy, but my biggest gripe is that you get to deal massive damage without so much of a thought or skill into it.
Fatal Blow - i love this addition supers now have a use in the game some people find this as an auto win but all you have to do is block and you get a free punish the armor is a bit OP though need multiple ways to meaty wake up fatal blow
Combos - personally much prefer mkx and even injustice combos to watch however i do like the change most require resource to deal good damage
Mobility - decent running would have been fine in this game might even by hype for tournaments  however all in all running isnt needed walking is fine maybe learn wave dash
Mix - i much prefer having to default into either block low or overhead then react to the other than guess on everything from grabs,overhead or low
Creativity - combos are very limited in this game its great that starters are limited but extenders and enders are always the same extenders doesnt need to have good damage but make us swag a bit and more options to end combos can be stylish and it keeps the defender on their toes.
wakeups - great mechanic every character has the same wakeup mixup no need to grind for every option
resource - recharges on its own barely even realize that i have no bar for the most part unless i got hit 

Online 
just went to wired recently from wifi would recommend playing on ethernet cable as well more tolerable minimal lag with that being said 200 ping is surprisingly playable considering the graphics upgrade but would recommend only playing below 150 ping. for the most part connectivity is great P.S. THERE ARE SO MANY SCORPION MAINS

towers 
klassic - still good as ever the basic arcade however isnt as playes as towers of time arcade towers
towers of time - the game mode that caused the multiple salty reviews and massive rage quits. most people play this arcade due to the rewards in it this is where you get those skins and gear for your character. for the most part this is easy however there are game modes in here which are absolutely mind boggling frustrating its a wonder if the developers even played it at all some modifiers are completely broken and unplayable e.g(screen goes into black, random assist, missile swarming,) would prefer these modifiers to be completely gone. 
Recommendation for future arcade ladders: dont create modifiers that takes out fighting game mechanics like the black out its headache inducing, also maybe for future games redesign the way you make arcade to something like CUPHEAD style where the boss is launching projectiles or attacks not from reading your input but a fixed animation and timing force the player to learn to adapt to random playstyles. for tower you have a good game design with the baraka gauntlet where the player goes through multiple baraka without LOADING SCREEN it is more immersive that way.

krypt
is a good addition also no other fighting game has a better lore than mortal kombat its good to see the easter eggs. But do keep in mind that the krypt is laggy for some players on PC so check your requirements and optimize. in the beginning of the game lifespan the krpt grind was exhausting there were to many currencies to farm and with the towers of time being unreasonably difficult you cant have any customization for your character the farming and grind is fixed now its easier just update yourself in online guides from youtube on how to get currencies easy.

the $6440 dollar micro transaction lie
you might have seen the post on reddit or in other social media that the game will cost a total of 6440 dollars of real money to purchase all skins and other customization for your character. This is a total bull in my opinion the math is even wrong if you do the research there wont even be the need to buy anything. the skin and gear for kustomization isn't reliant on real money there are multiple and easy ways to get what you want for your character there is no way for you to even buy everything since the shop is time locked only 5 are on display for every 4 hours and even if why would you even buy things other than the characters you play.

Kustomization
taking its roots from injustice 2 the game skins is fine but for some the gear changes is small e.g(scarlet blood vial) some skins are cool some are bad its a common them in fighting games that the popular characters gets the best skin and gear. 
skimpy outfits unfortunately is conservative personally would want the limitless option for clothing it doesnt need to make sense in fighting games the player can literally create their own backstory with that being said the game needs more skins variations and colors.

the politics
in all honesty some people get offended to easy right left or whatever the jax story line people overeacted to things which arent even there  and is never said or specified. the dialogue admitedly some are cringy asfk especially the choice to pick Ronda Rousey as the voice of Sonya for that marketing. there is also the whole sexy female ninjas ultimately the reason that NRS gave out is completely stupid but the politics in summary is a big MEH for future installments best either be subtle of stay away

53,54294326,english,"It is alright. In my opinion there has not been a good storymode since MK9. Not a fan of the graphics either. Sure it looks great, but the cartoony style from MK9 and its games before that entry will always be my preference.

[spoiler]The story has some good things like Baraka en the Tarkatans getting the respect they deserve. The Shokan and Sheeva were also great, even though they should have shown more of the Shokan. They showed Shao Kahn's strength against Kotal in a good way, Shao Kahn has always been the strongest. Current Scorpion making peace with old Scorpion was also great. 

The story reset was the worst thing ever. Kronika is a boring villain. They should have continued from MKX. Dark Raiden was awesome but he was ditched pretty early in the storymode. Some characters had no dialogue at all and some characters were not even in the storymode, yet they were in MKX. Where are they know? Who knows? It is not really explained. Where are Fuijin, Erron Black, Takeda, Kun Jin and Ferra Tor (another useless, boring character).[/spoiler]

The roster is alright. Cassie, Geras, Jacqui and Cetrion are just are not interesting to me. Geras has an original moveset, he has that going for him, but he has no real personality. The rest of the roster is actually pretty nice. The only new character that is actually pretty cool is the Kollector, but in the story he wasn't given a time to shine.

55,54287031,english,"-Game is definitely the best of the series so far
-Story is amazing 
-Gameplay is lit
-The Tutorial and practice are really newb friendly they teach you from the smallest things to the most complex combos
-The visuals are amazing
-Unlike with mkx where all the fighting arenas grim and dark you got different areas with different style and sense
-Krypt might be most meh thing about this game since the rng aspect can be really frustrating you can use some online guides that will help make the use of you currency as optimal as possible but its still hard to get the things that you actually need
-with that said the krypt still is the best krypt so far mkx one was so bland where you can just unlock every location in less than 30 mins of playing. The mk11 Krypt is pretty massive multiple locations needs hella grind but its still managable the only way its gonna be annoying is that if you want to unlock every skin in the game which will take you a very long time and I wouldnt know why would anyone wanna do that just look for the characters you are actually interested in playing
-Towers of time are really good
-store so far been pretty useless to me since I havent found a single item that I might be remotely interested to buy off it so I dont really know if time krysals are an issue I am sitting on 1k time krystals till I actually find anything to buy

-Grinding is a big factor in this game, whether that is a bad thing or not, is up for you to decide I guess.

73,51034526,english,"Superb! Well done Netherrealm. I must admit I was quite disapointed on MK X, but had high expectations for this one. And the game met each and every one of my expectations. The gameplay felt much better than its predecessor. The reactions of the kontrols and the koordination between the characters and what I actually wanna do, has improved a lot. Each character was great and super fun to play during the story mode, and now I'm focusing on a single character, and it feels great. 

The roster is fantastic and the amount and quality of the stages feels great. I love seeing back most of the klassic characters, I like most of the characters there and I'm looking forward for the already announced kombat pack 1 characters. Also the abilities and kustomization is great. This game will be installed on my PC for quite some time, which is a lot to say. The online matches are excellent too and the finishers are SUPER GOOORE!

This is definitely the best Mortal Kombat game I have played so far.

[b]UPDATE[/b]

This game is actually so good that I can't stop playing it and I simply keep it installed. I haven't had so much fun on a fighting game since I was a kid and played MK Trilogy. This game diserved an updated and more detailed review:

[b]Gameplay[/b]

The gameplay is fantastic. I can't say enough how good the reactions of the characters feel. Even more, the variety of movements and different kind of hits, with different time reactions, recovery times and stun times, adds so much to the game, since every move and the moment you make them, counts for something. Besides, there are so many characters, most of them good, that the diversity of what you can do on gameplay, is huge. I've played characters that have at least 9 different combos, and a bunch of special moves. Also the combos connect so nice to each other when cancelled, that the combination of combos and movements you can do is enormous. Even further, it's so easy to get nerfed combinations from the internet and master them, because the community is so big and there are tons of tutorials out there on how to get the best of each character. The gameplay, never gets old.

[b]Graphics and Performance[/b]

This game, looks goore-geous. This game reminds me so much of Injustice 2, because they achieved the same wonderful graphics, even better. The movements look so natural and the stages are so complex and good looking, that the game becomes super inmersive. Also the design of all the characters is great. The designs of this game are first level. And the effects look pretty nice too. I saw some people mention negatively about frames on story scenes, but that didn't happen to me at all. My PC specifications are at the end of the review, and I was able to play the complete game at Max graphics, without any issue. Even better, now I've lowered the graphics to get the max frames possible on online matches, and the game still looks great!!! I don't know on other PCs, but on mine this game had a superb performance.

[b]Music and Storyline[/b]

Quite frankly I don't hear much the music, because I get so deep into the game that I simply ignore it. But it must be nice, because it didn't annoy me. And the story was fantastic. I already said this, but I must remark it. It is the first time that I see a Mortal Kombat storyline and think...'Hmmm, that's actually a good story'. And the scenes are well acted, the voices are great, and the performances look authentic. It was a very enjoyable story.

[b]Characters Customization[/b]

The first thought on a fighting game, when you see character customization, is 'What the hell were they thinking on?' but I must admit it fits nice into this game. Some people have complained because when you change gear you have to level up each piece of gear again from zero. But come on, that's not such a big deal, and I care more for the gear for the stetic that anything else. Because if you're a good player, the gear won't be that important, besides the stetic changes, which is great because there is a ton of variety between gear and skins. And the great thing of customization is that you get to customize a certain amount of abilities, intros, endings, etc, which makes every character, something close to unique. I think this was perfectly achieved.

[b]Game Modes[/b]

The towers of time are really a pain in the ass, I must admit that critic is accurate from other reviewers. They have this custom difficulties that have nothing to do with the game, like missiles coming to your character, or random waves that leave you on the ground, that seem rather stupid. I prefer the classic towers, but then the towers of time are the only ones that give you certain rewards. And the krypt is simply too boring. But the classic towers are great and then the Online games are the best. I simply don't get bored. Sometimes I get angry hehe. But I have a loooot of fun playing online with other players. And I feel no latency at all, if the other player has a decent connection. None I can realize at least. And to play against other humans, is always much more fun on these games. I've spent lots of hours doing that, and I plan on keep doing that. And by the way, last but not least, the tutorials and trainings are great. Super complete tips. And if those are not enough, like I said, the community out there is huge, you'll find whatever you need.

[b]Characters Roster[/b]

The best. And they keep coming.

What are you doing?!? Buy the fucking game!!!

79,54164409,english,"Mortal Kombat 11 is a very fun game. We have finally been graced with a good NRS game, after the disaster that was MKX at launch.

Pros:

-Graphics and lighting are amazingly detailed and very well done

-Sounds are very satisfying (Ex. Shao Kahn's hammer and Jax's punches)

-Tutorial system is very well thought out and very informative for new or even experienced players

-Many options in training mode

-Animations are on point

-Customization system that allows you to create your own moveset and cosmetics for your characters

-60 FPS cut scenes, fatal blows, intros, krypt, krushing blows (On PC only; was 30 FPS in MKX)

-Krypt is very fun to explore

-Good story mode (MK is one of the only fighting game franchises with a decent storyline)

-Decent roster

-Fatalities and Brutalities are cool

-Mercies allow for comebacks and also some funny moments

Cons:

-Some chests in the krypt cost a lot of gold, requiring you to grind a lot

-Not all characters are balanced

-Only 3 ninjas on the roster (Scorpion, Noob, Sub Zero)

-Slower paced than MKX

-Less combo potential than MKX

-Very hard to make Youtube videos on MK videos alone, as youtube age restricts them as soon as they see blood

Conclusion: Mortal Kombat 11 is a very fun game and is worth the $60.

So much so I pre-ordered, took time off work with a friend and literally sat watching a count down clock for it to be playable. When I say I was excited, I really mean it. I absolutely LOVE this franchise. I've never geeked out like that before - was it worth it? You bet!

MK11 takes all the best parts of MKX, like speed, running, grabbing, technicality, high starters and bundles them up to be slam dunked into the trash pile. It then rounds up the god awful parts of MKX and expands on them, so people who like to range - you're in heaven. Remember Xrays? You know, the feature that no self respecting high level fighter uses because they max out at 33%(ish) dmg? You got em bro, and they feel like they go on for ever! (score!) On top of them, we also have this new feature NRS creamed out of their butt hole called ""Crushing blows"". But wait, there's more! Not only do crushing blows mimic xrays by absolutely destroying the rhythm of a fight and making you wait for what feels like an eternity, they also drain nearly a third of your dmg and take absolutely no skill to pull off. These stupid attacks are also coupled up with another stupid feature called ""fatal blows"" which lets you beat the snot out of someone when you're below 30% health with yet another boring animation. 

Try not to think of MK11 as a fighting game, think about it as a game that when you press a few buttons it will trigger a video that you have to watch that lasts 5-10 seconds and will be on repeat non stop in 15-20 second intervals, for every single fight you play. You watch more video than actually fight people. Have you ever seen the Gandalf Euro Sax (10 hour repeat) video? This is what it's like playing MK11, only it's not funny or enjoyable and the gandalf video is probably only 1/10th of the length of an xray.

MK11 is by far, the most god-awful game I have played from the franchise. It really does pain me to say that because of the foundations they have built for this game. The mechanics of this game feel flawless and they should have built on that by letting people actually fight. Instead they've decided to pump the game full of rhythm breaking videos and dangle them infront of the donkey-brained idiots who enjoy that carrot.

I am recommending this product, because I'm stupid and actually have it in my head that they can fix this and remove the endless videos, introduce running, fix grabbing, remove those stupid wakeups, speed up the game a little and bring back over heads.

-hope you enjoy grinding for....pretty much everything, because Warner Bros and NR Studios were so scummy in their avarice that they patched in DRM to disable cheat engine.  Your sou--er, I mean money, WILL be their's for all eternity.  
-skins are just color swaps 98% of the time, and they actually expect me to grind for this lameness 
-game has too many political agendas tainting the narrative and the experience
-developers insisted on ""more realistic"" female fighters, but Bushy Brows can't contain his fetishes and almost every female in the game is sporting stiletto heels--for ALL of their skins and outfits. TOTALLY REALISTIC RIGHT?
-censorship is off the charts
-you have to pay out the ass for Shang Tsung, and a ridiculously overpriced season pass if you want his movie outfit.  You can't even GET all of his content by just buying the cut content on the store individually. 
-takes too long to unlock anything

89,54120372,english,"This game is a boring ass grind. So for starters, lets just talk about the things I do like.

The fighting in the game is fun if flawed in my opinion. The animations of the characters look lively and their attacks look like they really hurt. From a visual stand point, the game looks great.

Moving on.

Online has way too many hiccups for my tastes. The game can lag for no reason whatsoever, regardless of how ""good"" your connection to the opponent is. This seems to only happen with cutscene type stuff. It's not.... normally an issue during the actual gameplay. Normally...

Aside from all that, I sincerely do not recommend this game at all. Several reasons why.

First of all is the Fatal Blow system. I do not like how it is implemented. Some characters have Fatal Blows that are insanely fast and not nearly unsafe as they should be. Considering this is the character's ""mega move"", I do not believe they should be as little risk as they are. And don't worry if you missed the first time, it recharges in like a few seconds so you can DO IT AGAIN IF YOU MISSED. That is really fucking stupid. You should not be allowed to bring that thing back in the same round if you screwed it up. You had your chance, that was it. 

The trade off is that if you did land it, then you can't use it for the rest of the match. Fine. But these things are still little risk. People can just throw them out of the blue and land them. It completely destroys the neutral game, which is the main focus of MK11. MK11 is not nearly as fast as the last two MK games before it. So for this to be in the game the way it is sounds really dumb.

As for the fighting, it's fun like I said. But there are definitely characters that need nerfing and buffing. Kotal Khan seriously needs a speed buff and characters like Sonya need a damage nerf. No one in the game should be able to take out well over 40% of your health with just one bar of offensive meter. I main Sub-Zero and he barely can get 30% out with a bar of meter, and that is with the most optimal combo that he could possibly do.

Another character that is a bit controversial right now is Scorpion. I don't have that big of a problem with him but when 90% of the community, especially the trolling community, plays him, he gets pretty annoying fast. There are like 25 other characters you could play. Why does everyone want to play him? Well it's because he is hella easy to use, does huge damage in one of his variations, and has one of, if not the, fastest attacking teleport in the game.

That's mostly why people hate him, aside from 90% of the community playing him. A lot of people hate his teleport. And I have to agree that in a slower paced game like MK11, his punish teleport is extremely hard to react to when he just throws it out at random. I personally know when to expect a Scorpion player to do it so it is not that big of a deal to me. But one of his ranked variations allows him to cancel it and that is a totally different story. That move makes the teleport one headache of a guessing game, because now he can YOLO teleport and get away with it. That move is hella difficult to deal with. Almost unreasonably so.

But you know what? I could forgive all of that. I could forgive the unbalance for some characters, the Scorpion players, the dumbass Fatal Blow system. I could forgive it all if it weren't for one BIG GLARING ISSUE.

The Krypt. Or rather how long it takes to get Gold, Soul Fragments, and Hearts to unlock chests to get things like costumes, gear, etc. inside it. The Krypt itself is kind of cool but its the shit that is going on that revolve around it that are the problem. And it is a massive problem. Gold isn't that much of a problem but you only get like 15 Soul Fragments each match you win, and you can get between 3 to 8 hearts depending on how you win. We will get back to that in a minute.

First of all, some of it's puzzles require you to grind for an item to get further into the Krypt. One of which is that you need to get Cetrion's Amulet, which requires you to get Cetrion's Head, which requires you to FATALITY HER FIFTY FUCKING TIMES. Well okay, I guess I will just go on local play, set the computer to Cetrion and do a fatality on her fifty times. NOPE. Has to be in the Towers of Time or the Klassic Towers. Which means you can't just pick her and keeping doing that until you get the head. Now you have to go through something like Endless Tower to do it.

So let me get this straight, NetherRealm Studios. You want me to go into the towers and fatality Cetrion every time I run into her fifty times so I can get an amulet and some gear for her? An amulet required to further proceed into the Krypt? And if you want all of the head chests open so you get all the gear, you are going to have to perform well over 1200 fatalities. 50 for each character, of which there are over 25 and counting.

On top of that, the very same puzzle also requires Shinnok's amulet, which requires you to blow away about 10,000 Souls to obtain and INGREDIENT for forging his amulet. Not the amulet itself. An ingredient for it. One of three if I remember correctly.

And the cherry on top? The Krypt is randomized with the exception of Heart Chests, of which there are few. So it might take awhile to get that cool Erron Black costume you really wanted or that badass hammer for Shao Khan.

Yeah fuck off with that. Fix your grindy ass game.

The problem however.. is that the damn game hangs up and crashes after every second fight starts Lol.

Tired of reloading it.. will wait for the next patch.  Maybe I can get through at least two scenes before it crashes..

Still some design flaws with Kombat League, but it's okay. Character balance is okay, some need adjustments but balance is never perfect. If you like Mortal Kombat, then you'll love this one. 

The only thing I'm not fond of is they've been kind of slow with post-release content. Most of us have been playing the same Towers of Time since the game launched. They add a one-time weekly tower every week, but it goes real fast and that's all they've been giving us. Not necessarily a terrible thing. Also, they have been real quiet about when new characters will be released, which sucks.

Most of what makes the game cool though is learning a charactere and playing online. I only played some matches and the PVP experience looked very decent.

Some pros play  matches with 90-170 ping and the games looks the same, so the lag compensantion looks decent.

If you want to see how the game looks when someone who actually learned the game plays it, I recommend searching for any mortal kombat tournament video on youtube and checking it out. Playing felt as challenging and satisfying as it looked for me.

[u] The Story: [/u] The story mode is the best I‚Äôve ever played in a fighting game. It is frequently hilarious, sometime even heartfelt and always over the top. It oozes with glorious cheesiness and always follows the rule of cool. ***Minor Spoiler *** [spoiler] At one point a character swallows their own soul and another character calls them out on it. This doesn‚Äôt even make sense in the context of the game but they just roll with it. Rule of cool is in full effect. [/spoiler] *** End Spoilers ***)

[u] The Training Mode: [/u] I haven‚Äôt played an MK game since UMK3 in the arcades so I was a little rusty. Luckily the training mode tutorials and the help system made it really easy for me to learn how to play. The tutorial starts with basic things like moving and jumping but keeps going all the way through combos and frame trapping your opponents. Each character has their own mini-tutorial and pressing pause brings up the full move list for every character. You can even pin moves to the screen so you don‚Äôt have the memorize them. It‚Äôs awesome. Every fighting game should go this in depth.

[u] The Characters: [/u] Every character has a well done voice and unique style to them. They all move and fight in slightly different ways. Some have larger hit boxes. Some have weapons so they can uppercut you from further away. Some are better up close, some like to zone. All of them can be customized with different abilities and cosmetics to make something that works the best for you. The intro smack talking dialogues are awesome as well, referencing inside jokes to the story and tons of other things.

[u] The Fighting: [/u] The fighting itself is the most in depth I‚Äôve played in a fighting game. Every attack leaves you vulnerable to a counter of some kind, there are basically no cheap moves in this game. Damage slowly lowers and gravity increases (this is covered in the tutorials) with each hit in a combo so infinite combos are basically impossible to do. You always have multiple options for any situation. For example, if you get knocked down you can: 1-2) Do one of two different get-up attacks 3) Hold the left trigger to stay down longer and fake out your opponent 4-5) Roll away from or behind your opponent (risking them countering by throwing you in the process) 6-9) Get up standing or crouching normally or blocking. When you lose, it‚Äôs usually because you made a bad decision or mistimed something. It feels like you always have a chance, and that‚Äôs great!

[u] The Towers of Time: [/u] I mostly play single player in the Towers of Time. There are a set of character towers where you can unlock things specific to each character (one of few places in the game where this happens); a fixed Gauntlet which varies between easy and insanely hard; a tower you can activate with keys and a couple random ones that cycle every few hours. The rewards are all shown before you start the towers, so if you don‚Äôt want skins for a character you never play you can skip them. Most are just regular fights with a few modifiers thrown in but some of them, particularly the tower to the right of the Character Towers can be awesome. My favorite Towers so far have been the single player tag team ones where you get to try new skins and moves you may not have tried out before. The Liu Kang/Kitana and Shao Khan/Skarlet ones were awesome! More of those please! They even put out a demo tower where you could try out Shang Tsung for a few days if you hadn‚Äôt bought him yet. There‚Äôs a ton of replay value here to keep things from getting too repetitive.

[u] The Port: [/u] This game looks beautiful and runs like greased butter at 1080p on my i5-4590 with an SSD and a Geforce GTX 960. It was a little buggy a few patches ago, but they‚Äôve been good at fixing things pretty regularly and this PC version is really well optimized. The UI even switches live between controller buttons and keyboard keys depending on what device you last used, a nice touch.

[b] THE BAD [/b]

[u] Some Cheap Modifiers: [/u] Most of the modifiers are fine. They add some challenge and variety to an otherwise normal fight. Other ones, like the chaos weather that scrambles your controls, the dark cloud that blacks out your screen the entire time and the ice weather that freezes you randomly no matter what you do are just cheap and frustrating. Please remove those.

[u] The Krypt: [/u] The Krypt is basically a Zelda dungeon with all the enemies cleared out. Exploring it initially is an ok way to cool down after some fights and unlock stuff, but it‚Äôs definitely designed to drag things out. You can‚Äôt fully unlock all the areas until you‚Äôve done 50 fatalities on every character, which takes a loooong time. The chests are all randomized so aside from some heart chests and a few other special ones you never know what you‚Äôre getting. You have to ‚Äúpay‚Äù (koins, not real money) to re-lock chests on a per chest basis and those re-locked ones mostly wind up being more tower consumables instead of skins. The skeleton keys are randomized too so if you use one on the wrong door you just have to wait until you get another one. There‚Äôs a slot machine thing that at least guarantees a skin or items at 100k and 75k koins respectively, but you have no control over what characters they are for. If you were hoping to make the perfectly customized character with just the right equipment, you‚Äôre at the mercy of the random number generator and there‚Äôs nothing you can do about it.

I think a lot of issues with the Krypt could be fixed if there was some item or token you could get that would let you unlock skins or gear of your choice. It wouldn‚Äôt have to unlock everything, but even something that just unlocked mortal level skins and gear would alleviate a lot of complaints.

[u] Repeated Towers: [/u] Sometimes the Towers of Time do repeat and when they do the loot attached to them doesn‚Äôt change, it just shows a green checkbox on it. It would be better if a tower you already completed just cycled to the next same level set of items when it re-appeared.

[b] THE WEIRD [/b]
[u] A Little Too Random: [/u] Sometimes the randomizer is a little too random for its own good. I‚Äôve seen two of the same item listed in the store at once. I‚Äôve also seen a Kitana skin in the third stage character tower that was marked with a green checkbox before I played it, meaning I had unlocked it somewhere else early. The loot tables need some work.

[u] Frost As DLC: [/u] I have no idea why they sell Frost DLC. If you play story mode she unlocks for free after Chapter 4. Don‚Äôt buy it, just play the game, it‚Äôs fun!

[u] The Store: [/u] It‚Äôs not really a store since you get a ton of time krystals just from playing through story mode and the various challenges. It‚Äôs just 5 random items that rotate once a day and if you see something you like trade in your krystals for it. Again, it‚Äôs all randomized so you can‚Äôt just buy what you want at any time, which is pretty weird for a ‚Äústore‚Äù. It's more like another set of chests you can see the contents of that needs krystals to unlock.

In short, if you like fighting games give this one a try. It‚Äôs a ton of fun. If you‚Äôre a completionist or just have to have a particular cosmetic on your fighters though, it‚Äôll drive you nuts.",1562470952,1562478925,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197993365410,74,9,15852,518,6836,1602039876,,

NRS has done an AMAZING job offering an in-depth tutorial teaching the fundamentals of not only MK11 but of fighting games in general.

Multiplayer is pretty solid, with the netcode being pretty darn good. I still have issues with online matches randomly ending or disconnecting but they are few and far between. Kombat League is a great addition that adds some incentive to playing ranked and has some nice rewards.

The customization aspect is great at first, having a vast amount of different customization options for each character. However, it takes a lot of time and effort to get the cosmetics and most of it is random where there is no chance of getting the cosmetics you want.

31,53568223,english,"There are a lot of aspects to this game I like and are well done.  I think a lot of people can look past it's flaws and get a lot of enjoyment out of this game, but there are too many parts that are super rushed and unpolished.  Overall, I am enjoying this game but at it's price point I'd give it a 6.5 which is why I am not recommending it.

Pros:
Combat is mostly really fun, and I prefer the pacing and meter changes from X.  I also like the krushing blows mechanic as it incentives you to use some other abilities and combos that would possibly get neglected.  It's a cool idea.
Roster - love most of the characters.  Most are pretty easy to pick up

Cons:
Tower of Time - total crap.  For the name Tower of ""Time"", very little time went into polishing this.  I picked the game up after NRS ""fixed"" this content.  It's still complete crap.  They push you into ToT for most character unlocks and currency, but the content is simply not fun.  Most of the combat and visuals are incredibly well done, but the ideas that when into Towers reflect poor execution of bad ideas.  Some modifiers are kind of fun, but too many are simply annoying.  The game isn't built foundationally like Smash Brothers, so these style modifiers don't work well here.  Not to mention the modifiers themselves are just terrible.  For instance there's one where every time you get hit, your monitor turns off.  There's another tower where the opponent switches randomly back and forth between having armor (which means you can't combo or stagger him) and having a damage buff where he literally 1-shots you whether you block or not.  In general, most of the modifiers are simply annoying.

Fatal Blows - NRS loves these super abilities so they'll never go away.  I'm not against them entirely in concept, but the implementation is  poor.  They're mostly annoying.  Like cliff racers in TES 3 Morrowind annoying.  They're everywhere - all the damn time.  Their damage is very high, they have no resource requirement, they're spammable in a way (if you miss, you can try again in a few seconds), some of them are damn near instant and full screen low/mids, and for who the fuck knows why they gave them armor on top of all of it.  They are fully punishable if missed, but they're super easy to combo into if you hit the opponent with pretty much anything.  It's the same animation every time, and you can't skip them.  They get old just seeing them, but they're especially annoying when playing the game and both players have to stop to watch this fatal blow commercial.  The threat of them does cause different play so I get what they were after, but the implementation just really disrupts the gameplay instead of adding to it.

Krypt - it's kind of cool, and I do like what they were trying to do.  The randomness bothered me at first, but now I'm fine with it.  It would be nice if it would prefer to drop things for your more played characters.  The performance, though, is total dick-cock.  It hitches super bad.  The poor performance doesn't make a huge deal because you don't fight much in here, mainly just run around, but it shows a lack of polish.

Balance - this is probably a really controversial topic that no one will agree on exactly when a game is balanced, but there's a reason everyone uses the same like 5 characters.  The ones I personally like the most I would say are well designed and pretty fair in terms of having strengths & weaknesses and being overall well balanced.  At the moment, I prefer Kano, Liu Kang, Raiden, & Sub-Zero (in that order).  They're fun, but not ridiculously overpowered, but not LOL bad like some others.  But if you compare them to like Sonya, Geras, and Erron Black - it's not very close.  On the other end you have D'vorah, Kung Lao, and a few others which to be effective with, you need to considerably outclass your opponent.  It just feels like the game was rushed out before they got time to really balance the roster.

Variations - this is coupled with Balance above.  The quality of the tournament variations are all over the place.  I wouldn't expect them to be perfectly balanced, but some of these aren't even close.  I also have to criticize the confusing way of how variations were implemented.  There are two variations for tournament play and these are locked - can't be changed.  I don't have an issue with having them locked.  They also have two variations for non-tournament play too.  The weird thing is these two non-tournament variations may or may not be the same as the two tournament variations - it depends on the character and variation.  So if you want to practice with a tournament variation you have to go into every single character's customization and check the skills and build new variations to copy the tournament ones.  I may not be explaining it well, but it's super clunky and just ties in with the theme that the game was rushed out.

Crashes - these always suck.  I don't get a lot.  Maybe four in total.  The reason I'm mentioning this is they can happen at any time and the game doesn't save your progress during a Tower of Time.  Towers suck enough as it is, and if you crash on the 8th opponent in a tower, you get to start all over at the beginning.  Getting one-shotted with your monitor turning off.


Overall - this game is super fun at times, but also head-scratching on how unpolished some simple elements are.  The thing is, the areas that need polish don't feel like they needed 6 months or a year of extra work.  Most of it feels like 6 weeks of focused polish would fix 98% of the issues.  That's also why I'm surprised they haven't already ironed much of this stuff out yet.  The game isn't horrible by any stretch, but these guys are veterans at these games, so I'm going to hold them to a higher standard.",1562270296,1562270296,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197962660493,160,3,4103,0,3819,1564945900,,
32,53563112,english,"I didn't play MKX, but I did play MK9. It's sad to see some of my favorites not in the game, like Ermac and Reptile, but the cast in this game is still pretty good. Definitely downsized from X as well. However, if you can look past the smaller roster, the gameplay is great. A little slow for my tastes as someone plays a lot of anime fighting games, but it's not bad. This is VERY NEUTRAL FOCUSED. If you don't know what that means, you're going to want to learn fast if you want to win games. Krypt progression has mostly been fixed. There are still some tweaks here and there that I think could push it to be better than it already is. Towers of Time being pulled back make them much more beatable, but if you're only looking specific characters, outside of summoned towers and character specific towers, it can be hard to find gear for them.
That leads me to gear. It's all for customization so it isn't a big deal imo that it's mostly all locked behind story mode, AI battles, Krypt, and Towers of Time. However, it's near impossible to get all the unlocks for every character in a reasonable amount of time. With no guarantee on what Towers will show up, RNG from Krypt boxes and AI battle rewards, good luck getting things for your mains. Some of the gear does look great though, and due to it being cosmetic only, I can't say that this really hinders the game in any meaningful way.
Last, move set, or variations, or whatever we're calling them. With 2 tournament variations for Ranked/Tournament play, some of them are clearly better than others. Some just don't matter what you pick, because the base moveset is strong enough to carry either (Sub-Zero). With custom sets, however. The game becomes even more insane. Some characters get some really strong combo potential from their moves. Noob Saibot is one of these characters, who easily doubles his combo damage, just by having 1 move in his variation.

67,53457506,english,"As someone who has sunk hours into the game, I can say this title might be one of my favorite 2.5D fighters, with games such as Under Night In-Birth. While the story may be a bit weak and predictable to anyone who's played the previous NetherRealm Mortal Kombat games before, the combat, characters, attention to detail, and even the sound direction and music is impressive.

-Combat (Kombat?)
I think that the combat all feels very responsive and performing basic combos feels satisfying because of clear and apparent registration of attacks, along with every hard sound that accompanies it. Special attacks, while some custom attacks don't exactly fit in character for who is using them, are still enjoyable and sometimes even more fun to watch. Blocking is made into its own button which I believe gives new players a sense of security, knowing that something as important as blocking has been made into a simple responsive command, and the more advanced players are allowed the opportunity (finally) to read frame data from the move set list itself. Along with that, I never came across a time where I felt one character was clearly more powerful than another. Each character has combat and combo potential, without being overpowered or underpowered.

-Characters (Kharacters?)
As like most recent Mortal Kombat games, characters are given a very clear identity from one another. From how they fight, to their design, to their personality. Along with this, all characters are given many customization options (I'll go in depth about the means of unlocking these customizations in a moment, as that is an entirely different beast). From the costume they wear, to something as minute as the weapons they use. I personally enjoy pre-fight conversations between fighters, something that was included in Mortal Kombat X and brought back to this game. They're capable of producing friendly banter, threats of slavery, as well as answering more questions about the lore of Mortal Kombat.

-Attention to Detail
Of course a game coming out in this time needs to look very good, especially if it's being released by a large company. And this game does not disappoint. The game returns the standard Mortal Kombat gore many are familiar with, and it is just as over the top as ever. The main winner of this detail being, of course, the fatalities. Few times did a fatality feel out of character, and each one is such a messy joy to watch with all of the impeccable effects that have come from this age of gaming. Though if you have a rather weak stomach for an extensive amount of gore, which there clearly is and has become one of the major selling points of Mortal Kombat, you may wish to look somewhere else.

-Sound Direction and Music
It's no secret that a fighting game or even a game in general is not nearly as satisfying to play if you don't feel the impact of everything going on. In a fighting game, the impact is quite literal. Satisfaction can be acquired in a fighting game by making each hit have a powerful, descriptive sound to it. This is something that Mortal Kombat does with exceptional quality. Every attack and impact feels harmful simply because of how the sound makes it seem, thus making it all the more satisfying to achieve a combo and have each attack connect with a meaty strike (sometimes literally). Along with this, while it doesn't have the most recognizable score on its own, with enough time playing even I've come to remember a number of songs. Most music fits the theme of the stage that is being played on, and makes the fight feel just a little more natural.

Now the cons, are tricky to talk about as I don't necessarily feel they ruin the experience very much, but it wouldn't be right to say that this game is perfect. This game's cons include business practices, slow and sometimes ineffective development, and competition (Bear with me).

-Business Practices
I'm sure it's no secret that WB Games doesn't have the best track record when it comes to their games, and that clearly shows here. To start with, the DLC. Now while I'm sure it says somewhere within the fine print of the deep dark holes of the main page for the game, it is not made explicitly clear that the character Frost is unlockable through story gameplay. I've seen many cases of this and it's why her DLC is poorly reviewed. Now if you're someone who doesn't care for the story and just want to have the entire roster as soon as possible, you can, however I believe it's a waste of money. Along with this, the Kombat Pack DLC does not include fighters like Shao Kahn and Frost. However where as Frost is unlockable through gameplay, Shao Kahn is a pre-order bonus that game with the game for free. It just feels disjointed and confusing that they made the Kombat Pack lack these fighters. Along with this, cosmetics aside from Krypt unlocked cosmetics, which use an in-game currency, are randomized, and more than often require microtransactions to obtain, unless you want to continue to test your luck. Now I personally don't use the microtransactions as every item can be obtained by chance for free, but I understand that it can be aggravating to see a cosmetic you want be available for a limited time behind a virtual paywall.

-Development
While I don't see this as much of a problem as it allows for more to come out of updates, there have been complaints that development of the game is slow and ineffective. Players are apparently still unable to open the game even months after its initial launch. While I've never had a problem with this, I've seen this development first hand as the Krypt and story cutscenes have been known to stutter in frame rate. There have also been a number of lighting errors in the Krypt.

-Competition
Now let's get one thing out of the way. I don't hate competition. In fact I believe that competition is an effective means of becoming better at something. What I mean is that there is a clearly competitive theme behind any fighting game, and players who would rather enjoy a casual game just to mess around and have fun, won't find that here. While it is a joy to play casually with friends, playing online will not yield the same result. This should be expected, but be forewarned. Casual while not as ""high stakes"" as competitive, is still rather competitive in nature simply because of the genre of game.

With all of this said, I still think that someone who hasn't had experience in Mortal Kombat before can enjoy this game. The pros in my opinion outweigh the cons, especially if you have friends who enjoy fighting games as well. With that said, this game has my recommendation.",1562209065,1562209065,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False,76561198046094629,291,5,9853,0,8577,1596251724,,

13,53287024,english,"So I am giving this game a recommendation because I still get a lot of enjoyment from it but there are a few problems you should be aware of.
Cons:
1. The Towers of Time are locked behind Internet access so if you don't have Internet or have spotty Internet do not buy this game as you'll only actually get like 30% of the content.
2. Some customization options feel very limited or are just slightly different colors of the same skin so basically there are only four or five skins per character you'll actually want to use.
3. There is almost no punishment for using a bot fighter instead of doing it yourself so most of the time it's faster and easier and more rewarding to have your AI play the game than for you to play yourself which I disagree fundamentally with as a video game.
4. While Fighting games (specifically Netherrealm games) are prone to unbalanced characters this game has a few (If you main Scorpion you're cheap) and with no balance update in sight, despite DLC characters being added the tier lists are roughly the same as they were day one.

Pros:
1. Netherrealm listens to the community. Week one they changed the Towers because everyone complained they were too hard (they were) and playing the Towers is still easier with a bot but not impossible to do yourself anymore.
2. The game looks fantastic, sounds fantastic, and runs smoothly even on a low tier graphics card.
3. Even though there is a microtransaction option, the stuff that can be bought using that system changes only once a day and it's only 5 cosmetics per day so chances are you'll almost never have any reason to use the microtransactions.

In conclusion the saving grace of this review is the fact that Netherrealm has a history of responding positively to fan feedback (begging for Mileena or Rain is not fan feedback it's being annoying) and I trust them to not take advantage of their player base.",1562125715,1562125715,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198378709661,90,6,13994,32,7911,1601750748,,

24,53257361,english,"Mortal Kombat has in recent years become one, if not the, game franchise that I love the most. MK 11 does a pretty damn good job of being a great MK game. 

If you've played MK X then you are used to the fast fighting that comes with that game, MK 11 slows it down a lot. I went through MK X again before playing 11 and as soon as I played my first fight I felt like the match was in slow motion. At first this felt weird, but now I consider it to be a really great improvement. Now I feel like the fights mean more, and using abilities and special moves is valued more. 

The characters I think are, for the most part, really quite fun as well. I actually (and this is an unpopular opinion) like the new characters more than 80% of the old characters because they feel unique, and new. 

The towers are also a debated topic in that a lot of people dislike them. I have only played the klassic towers, but I have fun playing them. 

The story is weird, because there are some parts that are GREAT, and other parts that are just plain meh. I think that the concept of the story is really cool, and in some ways it plays out well also, however, some parts of the story seem like they were just forced in so that some of the characters have a purpose in being there. Plus, not to mention the fact that I think the ending is anti-climatic. The end is alright I would say.

Take the negative reviews with a grain of salt as most of them reflect the initial, grindy stage of the game.

I bought it after the patch which fixed that, so I can't complain.

As for eventual disconnects: they happen to me when the connection between me and my opponent is iffy.

The game modes:

Story mode: worth playing (except for not being able to perform fatalities ever!).

Towers of time: really cool to unlock new stuff. It's grindy, but you can use AI fighters.

Krypt: interesting and nostalgc as you can visit famous MK sites such as the Pit (including the bottom of it). Hopefully they come up with new content for the Krypt to keep it alive and relevant.

AI battle: I can take it or leave it, honestly.

Versus: addictive. I strongly recommend playing story mode and Towers for some time before joining. Also, some practice on the tutorials are highly encouraged. Playing other characters/against them lets you in on some of their strengths and weaknesses, when to block, when to counter, etc.

All in all: I strongly recommend this game for fighting game enthusiasts and fans of the MK series alike.

ATTENTION: I will keep this review as simple as possible, so if there is something i missed, its most likely beacuse im trying to keep it simple. If i missed something major (whitch i think i dint) then i apologize. 

Kombat Yard:
Kombat yard shows your Current activities, Challanges , notifications and your overall kareer stats.

Store: 
Store has 2 sections, prenium store where you can use time krystals to buy skins, and store (idk why they named a section store and put store in it as well), is where you can buy DLC, characters or time krystals with real cash. 

The Currency: 
There are 4 currencys in the game, Koins, Soul fragments ,Hearts and time crystals. Koins and Soul fragments are the currencys you will earn with any fight , they can be used in Krypt, Towers of time, Towers , pretty much anywhere to buy crates, skins , items and consumables. Hearts is a currency you earn if you do fatality or brutality, those are mostly used in certain crates in Krypt. Time crystals is the  currency for the Store to buy skins etc they can be earned by leveling up. They can also be earned by paying real money. 

KONQUER SECTION: 

Storyline:
The storyline took me roughly 4-5 hours to finish, and it could have ended much sooner if i knew how to play properly (i straight jumped to storyline without actually learning how to play) . The storyline itself is alright, i would explain further but i think that its something you should experience yourself. But its not something to crayz ,there isnt any clifhangers, plot twists or whatever. The cutscenes are great, and sometimes gives you 2 options to chose to play as in certain chapters whitch leds to different cutscenes and dialoges.

Krypt:
The most simple way to explain Krypt is that its a island where you can buy crates with currencys , you can also achive items that are only in Krypt to go places in Krypt, you can also trade your items with trade with Kollector in Goros Lair. The Shang Tsung (owner of the island) will give you enough information about the island. 

Klassic towers :
Klassic towers is basically casual version of towers of time, those are basically AI generated fights that you participate in as a player you wish to play, or sometimes as 1 selectable character. Each towers are usually different, there is unlimited ones were you fight until you are beated , and there are casual towers where you beat random fighters until you face Kronika whitch is the main villian of the game. Finishing klassic towers usually rewards you with items and gold coins, and gives you a end credit video of the character you played as to beat the tower. Those end credit videos are the videos where your character takes the aero glass, a object that controls times and universe. 

Towers of time : 
Towers of time is harder version of Klassic towers, and when you beat them you get awarded with skins that you wont be able to get anywhere else. The other major difference is that those towers are time limited, so you have some time to beat them otherwise their time will run out and that tower will be replaced with other towers. You can also use consumables to help you while fighting, or simply get more coins. If you want skins, items, consumables its a good place to stop by. 

Fighting againts AI:
At first, it will seem like AI knows your every move, whitch it is somewhat true its not unbeatable, fighting againts AI espacially in towers in time could be challenging, but with enough practice its definetly managable. Easy mode by its name is extremly easy, Medium could be challenging for beginners, hard could be challenging and very hard is the difficulty  that will challange you the most. Anything less then very hard makes the AI fighter be idle, sometimes they stand around waiting to be punched in the face, but anything above medium is where AI starts to challange you. 

FIGHT SECTION : 

Local:
Basically a simple fight againt a human (basically someone you can play with the same PC with different controllers/keyboards), or AI.

Tournament: 

Its fighting againts a human with Tournament settings on

AI Battle:

Aƒ± only gives you a abbility to create 3 fighter teams to face other player made teams.

RANKED:

Kombat League: 
Its a fight with Tournament settings againts a human player.

KASUAL:

Versus: 
Versus is a standart mode againts a human player.

King of the hill: King of the Hill allows players to observe and react to the match going on between the champion and the next challenger as they wait to play the defending champion. Spectators can display different reactions based on the fight taking place. Kombatants earn Respect Points based upon the recently played match, with spectators given the opportunity to rate the winner of the battle 0.0 out of 10. After the ratings have been awarded, the loser leaves the stage and joins the spectators while the next challenger in line fights the defending King. (Source from Mortal Kombat wiki, honestly dint know much about it)

AI Only: 
By its name, its AI only.

PRIVATE :

Versus can be used to invite people from your friendlist to fight againts.

Kustom lobby by its name is a lobby where you can use kustom settings and fight againts someone in your friendlist.

Practice:
Practice is used for practicing with someone in your friends list.

Its a place for customizing your fighters with skins, and equiping certain moves , set intros and outros,  and setting AI behaviour if you wish. You can also make variations for each fighter to quickly switch between.

Kollection: 
Kollection is a place where you can see Consept arts, musics, endings and recipies you have collected.

LEARN:

Practice:
Practice basically makes you use combos , special moves etc. to a programable AI. You can record moves and save , for example you can make your character to shoot a projectile and you can program aƒ± to dodge it. 

Tutorial: 
The tutorial basically teaches everything you need to know, from Fatalities to combos, special moves to unique tutorials for each fighter. I strongly advise you to visit tutorials before playing if you are new to the Mortal Kombat. I would advise you to master at least 1 character before playing online or simply fighting againts AI. 

Fatality Traning:
By its name, it teaches you to do fatalities. Beware that some fatalities are in Krypt, so you have to unlock them to use it. New fatalities are different then previous ones, now fatalities slows down time when your character finishes his/her fatality instead of previous ones where time keeps on going.

Now its time to talk about what this game does wrong:
It was stuck on 30 fps before (yup im not kidding) but now you can go to your settings and set it to 60. The PC port isnt perfect in fact for some people the game constantly crashes, my game dint crash, only 1-2 times while loading KRYPT. Sometimes it feels like your hits doesnt connect, and online games can lag to hell. 

Overall: 6/10 its much better then other MK games if it works, beware that PC port isnt perfect , i highly suggest you to get PS4 or XBOX1 port instead since they are most likely more stable. Im not saying PC port is unplayable, its just not as stable as console ones. If the game works as intended, its a 8/10 for me.",1562102796,1562102857,True,2,1,0.548872172832489014,2,True,False,False,76561198155238358,83,16,2036,0,1654,1566227007,,

At the same time its very optional so you can learn things at your own pace. If I have to rate this game then I would give it a 9/10. The net code is great and quality of matches is amazing. The fact that you can customize the way your game reads your inputs, is just insane. No other game gives you the option to use or disable release check as well as input shortcuts for moves. Then to further the personalisation aspect of the game, you can customize not only the look but the move set of your characters as well. My only issue is with the RNG of the krypt.

Pros:
-Game Play has been nicely improved with the change on ""X-ray"" -> ""Fatal Blow"" since this gives a more strategic aspect to the fight instead of spammy spammy do lots of damage.  The addition of krushing blows lets you adapt your fight style to land these suckers and do TONS of damage.
-Gore Gore Galore.  This game gives you plenty of gore with their Krushing Blows, Fatal Blows, Brutalities and of course, FATALITIES which are some of the most gruesome yet.
-Customized characters let for you to pick your style of play and your look of character.  This customization is great for decking out  your main character and letting you show the world who you're gonna kick their ass with.   You can also personalized the gameplay of your characters too or follow the competitive preset for more serious players.

Cons:
-Story Mode is just a playable movie.  Although this new graphics engine looks amazing, sometimes I want to play a game when I load up a game. Having long cut scenes with a quick 1 battle fights ever so often just feels like I'm watching an interactive movie not playing a game's story mode.
-The Krypt is full of Krap.  Unfortunately with the addition of customization comes the addition of wasteful crap to unlock.  This was always annoying when you unlocked things like concept art but now we have the fun of unlocking forge items, fight style icons, recolors of the same 3 skins, and Konsumables that you'll never remember to use.  On top of this is the fact that you have to walk around a 30 fps map and spend 3 separate currencies on chests with the same animation over and over.  This map is also pretty big with plenty to unlock which can be fun but annoying when you have to sit and watch your character go through 3 loading zones just to unlock more Lui Kang Art.  Also there are deadly enemies in the Krypt that kill you in 1 shot so you need to either fight them or spend an item to avoid them.",1562039113,1562039113,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198043802134,89,2,3341,0,2952,1584589297,,

40,52929124,english,"This review is going up some months after release, so for the most part the launch issues are gone and as such I will not consider them.

TL;DR, Story is worst than the previous two games, combat is slower and duller than MKX. Lootbox system (oh im sorry, Shrine and chests, WAY different...) is anti consumer and arbitrary. If you want a good fighter on PC, look at Tekken 7 instead.



MK11 is basically what youd expect, Mortal Kombat. Overall, the gameplay is slower than previous games, and there is a noticeable lack of moves in the moveset per character. Between that, ad the seemingly arbitrary method of picking your 2 or 3 additional variation moves, I found it to be less enjoyable than prior entries in the series.

The only real benefit of 11 I liked was the aesthetics and customization, but even that is hampered by the lootbox RNG system of getting colors and pieces. The main method of getting these are in the krypt, but of course since its Warner Brothers, the chests are all random and can even contain mobile game style konsumables for the single player mode.

Towers of Time is a good idea in theory, but it ends up being more annoying than difficult. They should have done away with consumables (which is a blatant bloat item in the krypt that makes it harder to get actually interesting items). If they had balanced it around the idea of not having consumables and just being good at the game, you know.. like a fighting game.. it would be way more enjoyable.

The framerate has a habit of of dropping for seemingly no reason. This port is simply not well optomized. The story mode itself is... fine, I suppose. Not as good as MKX or MK9, and while SOME of the new characters are interesting (Geras in particular is my new favorite), some of them fall flat and just feel odd (such as Kollector).

52,52558165,english,"Definitely the best Mortal Kombat game to date. 

The gameplay is easy to get into but hard to master. All of the characters have similar button commands and are pretty much equal in terms of (lack of) difficulty to pick up and play.  Every character's movesets seem to follow a nearly identical pattern of having basic moves, combos, specials, projectiles, throws, and obviously brutalities and fatalities. The main  differences between each character's fighting style comes down to speed of animations, number of overheads/highs/mids/lows, number of unblockables, and number of defensive moves like parries and grapples. There are  less noticeable attributes too like damage output, combo-ability, unsafe/safe on block and others that are in effect, but I think those aren't as vastly different from character to character. While tier lists exist for this game, you can in theory kick any characters ass with just about anyone on the roster. 

The game looks damn good for being on Unreal Engine 3. The graphics and art design are on point for a new gen game. The face scanned head models on all the characters make them look better than they've ever looked before. The animations, while a lot better than the last game, are still a little strange to me, at least in my opinion.  They're not the best they could be in a genre that absolutely demands perfection for animations. Style wise, the fight animations have an unrealistic, sometimes cartoony approach to them, like Erron Black's whole gunslinger shtick and the Cage family nut punches, which is fine since MK isn't suppose to be serious, but there were times where some moves look too silly, like when anatomy rules get broken or when people go flying from small amounts of force, etc etc. I think it could've been polished more, but totally a preference thing and inconsequential. On a technical level, I encountered a few instances of the hit box detection not working right, but not enough times for it to feel like it ruined the fight. 

I don't have much to say concerning the audio. The music is fine as background noise. I wouldn't buy the soundtrack. The sound effects are punchy and effective. The voice acting is amazing across the board and I love it. 

The story is honestly bad but still entertaining as a B rated Kung Fu movie plot. If you turn your brain off like I did, you've have fun with it. The 3 line intro dialogues between pairs of characters are way more entertaining and some even contain interesting pieces of lore. I definitely recommend not skipping those when playing bot matches.

I personally have very much enjoyed this game so far, the gameplay is pretty slick and the graphics are great (though they have high requirements). 
There are microtransactions, however it is all done with currency you can earn in game and it's not a grindfest at all (though I have heard that this wasn't the case at launch). You can get a lot of Koins for doing barely anything at all. The Time Krystals are a little harder to obtain but I've only used them once as they are the currency for the in game store, whereas Koins are used in a free roam area called the Krypt where you spend them to open chests that drop gear and skins.

For example, the first ""set"" (2 matches) will go fine and then about 20s into the next set the game will freeze and you will see a small icon in the bottom of your screen with a disconnected cord flashing red. A few seconds later the match ends and you are presented with a screen asking if you would like to find a new opponent. 

Beyond that issue, the lag is sometimes so bad that the game is literally in slow motion and you have no idea if your button inputs have gone through; a very frustrating experience for a game that is so timing dependent.

First review: ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

Easily one of the worst experiences I've had with a game on Steam. 

So Neatherrealm decided to release MK11 on steam but this game is clearly not ready for release (on PC). Look at my game time played, you think I've even played 1 minute? NO! The 1.9hrs it shows on my profile were failed attempts of the game even launching (Must be at the hundred mark now). I know this isn't a fault with my PC because Neatherrealm have stated themselves that it is an issue with them and they will fix it within the next week, but this kind of stuff is unacceptable from such a big company. I've had the game for 2 days and I haven't even played it once, I've given them countless amounts of emails which they still haven't replied to and this is just rubbish! I'm keeping my game time played at 1.9hrs so i can refund it if anything goes wrong and maybe buy a better game that can actually OPEN for a start. 

Do i recommend this game? NO NO NO NO NO! Thank you =)",1556468528,1561860810,False,2,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198067751728,48,6,2631,0,112,1561978637,,

So, yea, having watched Maximilian D00D for like 10 hours, he was hype, I was hype, my friend was hype. And then the hype died and was replaced with disappointment. 

The Krypt, which they've said they are going to patch to address the grind, is literally a predatory practice. Multiple forms of kurrency and the amount you gain is vastly inferior to the costs required. Intentionally making something terrible & then going ""oh sorry, we'll fix it"" then putting a bandage on it so it's no longer 'terrible' but just 'bad' going ""Hey look, we 'fixed it', we're good guys!"" while it's still just frustrating enough to make you spend money... that's the epitome of sleazy and predatory.

That's their goal, look like good guys fixing something they intentionally broke, making you spend money on top of the $60/$100 you spent to buy the game (of which the content you are buying w/ these MTX is in the game, so you already paid for it)

Here's a quick example: 90% of the 'heart' boxes shown on stream, cost /250/ hearts to open, each. You earn... 1 heart per fatality & 2 hearts per brutality. While exploring the Krypt, you can occasionally find bodies hanging in the world & they may have 1-2; It's about the same timeframe as a kombat & brutalizing opponent. So you are looking at a 3-5 minute fight for one-two hearts & you need 250... just to open one box & it has /random/ contents. You may not even get anything you want, or that is usable for your character. Which is a whole other layer of RNG on top of RNG on top of RNG (lootboxes, to get random stuff, and even if it's gear, it has random slots for the augments, which are also random)

Now lets throw in 'filler' items. There are 3 sets of icons for your variations, black/gold/red & there are 30 each, so that's 90 icons. I don't know how many kombat kard borders/backgrounds there are, but icons? If you have Shao Kahn, that's 2250 filler items in your Krypt item pool, on top of like 30 different konsumables for the towers, & like a dozen krafting materials; And those icons? You can get duplicates, so even if you get one from a box, you can still get another.


The kombat in the game? Really nice, fighting is actually good and stands up to past games. You will enjoy when you actually get a fair fight. The Story? Pretty epic. Actual single player content post-story? Absolutely frustrating, designed to make you spend money to bypass or speed it up. NRS & WB have gone out of their way to try & milk the game as a quick cashcow & are making themselves look like the good guy by saying they're looking into 'fixing' the intentionally terrible grind they created. 

The Towers of Time are rotating random lootboxes. I say this because they are super difficult and you don't always know what the new tower will hold when it rotates in. Have to hope it is something you want. And if it is? Good luck beating the extremely unfair mutators unless you have a ton of farming done for Konsumables to counteract... or you know, you could just buy (eventually, it's disabled right now as of this review, I wonder why :thinking:) a 'Skip Token' to do as it says, skip the fight but get credit for it. Makes the towers an up-and-coming lootbox as you'll be too frustrated and unable to just power through to get your stuff, and buy with real money, the bypass.

Slight Addendum on ToT: They're still bad, not as bad, the patching has been working on it. It's still the worst part. Secondly worst right now is that we can't customize ranked sets very much, so some of the best looking or interesting moves are not tournament viable (looking at Shang Tsung)

Lets look at Graphics. The game is and is not FPS locked. The Krypt? 30FPS lock, other parts? 60FPS lock. It doesn't feel good when it flips through like that. If we could smooth it out to a straight 60FPS for everything, it would do wonders. Anti-Aliasing is sporadic as well and can be very distracting. As usual, a PC game ported from console doesn't have all the same options a 'made for PC' game does, and sacrifices were made, making this a poor adaption.

One of the Crashes to Desktop people are having? Apparently it's related to the RGB keyboards. If you disable the option ingame to use the RGB colours, ta-dah! fixed (at least for a few friends who relayed this to me).

I cannot in good conscious recommend this. And the only reason I didn't refund immediately, is because you have to own the game here on Steam to post these reviews. 
-With hope the harsh backlash will make WB Games and NRS realize they have another Middle-Earth: Shadow of War and IJ2 on their hands and actually apologize and fix it, not this canned 'We made it terrible, we'll make it less terrible to be the fake good guys' that is currently going on. Microtransactions are destroying the single player post-story enjoyment, and the pure RNG is making it unfun to unlock things. Graphically the game is inferior to the consoles, but hey, we don't double-dip for online access like the 3 consoles (not a fair trade at this point).",1556042380,1561825619,False,3460,111,0.863481640815734863,0,True,False,False,76561197999369843,469,8,584,0,9,1556949724,,

Story mode is alright.  It feels like you spend more time watching cinematics than fighting, but it builds to a very nice conclusion with some very exciting moments.  The krypt is where you'll spend the majority of time unlocking skins/consumables/fatalities etc.  It's fun to explore, although a general consensus is that the mechanics aren't the best for unlocking things.  Duplicates are possible from chest rewards, and that can be frustrating.  The towers of time can feel grindy.  Luckily, there's an AI option that can do some of the work for you if you don't want to grind out matches.  My biggest gripe has been how DLC has been handled.  I preordered the game and kombat pack.  Only one character has been released, and the kombat pack is currently on sale.  Kind of a bummer considering I essentially paid more for a week of early access for one character.

I have purchased Mortal Kombat 11 with Kombat pack and my game isn't launching. I have an Alienware M17x R4 laptop and it plays most of the games with no issues.

I can use my computer and move the mouse cursor but it stays black if I have the game window open.

29,51965691,english,"Mortal Kombat 11 is an excellent fighting game and an excellent game in general (in my personal opinion). It looks great, it sounds great, the story and cinematics are very cool and expertly crafted, bringing joy all the way through your main story playthrough, giving you rewards along the way. It has classic towers of different lengths, survival and endless tower, and also towers of time, which have different modifiers and an option to beat boss-characters in co-op, bringing players new and different challenges every hour or so. There is also the infamous Krypt, which became a point of contradiction for may players (aside from the towers of time, which have since been fixed). It's now been made as a 3rd-person adventure game where you open chests for coins that you aquired through normal gameplay (which has always been the case) and no, there is no way to buy neither currencies for unlocking stuff in the Krypt, nor is there a way to buy ""Konsumables"" for towers of time. The only purchasable currency - ""time krystals"" - can be either purchased for real money or aquired through normal gameplay for certain challanges and levelling up your player level. For this currency you can only buy easy fatality tokens (which was also present in Mortal Kombat X) and character customisation items (which rotate on a daily basis), but can also be aquirted through normal gameplay. Aside from that and the fact that game has a lot of singleplayer content, this Mortal Kombat is more online/competetive/e-sports oriented. It has a great tutorial, which covers all the basics and different mechanics of the game, has character-specific tutorials and the player also gets rewarded for completing them. Online is very robust and has meny different game modes and features. Also, it now has seasonal Kombat League, which brings unique rewards for competitive players. 
The game has some issues regarding online connectivity and some plroblems with PC optimisation. Although, apart from annoying micro-stutters during online (and offline as well) - nothing gamebreaking. Also, some reviewers pointed out that there is no outstanding music, and I agree with them. But the music that is there is functional, stylistically coherent and gets the job done.It is also important to point out that gameplay-wise, this Mortal Kombat is a bit different than the previous Mortal Kombats. The fighting system has been redesigned to support this more e-sports/competitive approach. And though I liked the previous Mortal Kombats and Injustice games form netherrealm, I personally fell in love with this one. Aside from some problems with patches, which represent only current inconveniences for online players, I can wholeheartedly recommend this game. It has a lot of content, it's easy to get into and it's now more then ever aimed at stimulating players of different skill levels to get better.",1561815999,1561815999,True,1,0,0.499679684638977051,0,True,False,False,76561198049132683,578,4,24486,0,15485,1590981732,,

From 9 and X, 11 is the culmination of all of the great aspects of those games bundled up into a nice package.

A quick breakdown of positives:

- Much better matchmaking and ""netcode"" for online play
- Quick and numerous post-launch support patches
- Plenty to do if you're not an online player (Krypt, Towers, Unlocks)
- Most badass and fleshed out versions of characters yet
- This entry in the series is astronomically more active than previous
- Great PC features, such as 60FPS Fatalities

Some minor negatives:

- Character roster is good, but some series staples are missing (Ermac, Reptile, Smoke, etc.)
- Two Fatalities per character seems low, but 8+ Brutalities eases it
- Cross-platform play would be a Godsend

The soundtrack has been improved and is actually not that bad either.

The story mode continues from where X ended and i'd say it's the best one out there so far.

-I don't know why Frost is a purchaseable dlc when she is a free character that you can get from the story in chapter 4.
-The krypt is a grind but if your someone that will be playing this game for a while then it's not much. 
-Microtransactions are wack 
- A lot of Konsumables 
The Neutral
- I somewhat like how you can create your own variations but at the same time I somewhat wanted the 3 way variations for each character like mkx.
- Online is ok but Randomly, when someone leaves the match it doesnt count as a quitality, it just instantly end the game and ask if you want to find another player.
- The items in the krypt all depends on your satisfaction. you don't know what is on the other end of the boxes because it can be a character that you don't like but get the items either way * Cough* *Cough* KABALSACK *Cough* *Cough* 
- Time Towers are mixed to me but hey, there's ai fighters. 
The Pros
-The story is way better than mkx by a lot.
-My Sleep paralysis finally returned (Noob Saibot) 
- 30fps cap fixed.
- Graphics are smooth for me
- Fatal Blow, Krushing Blow, Fatality and brutality never looked better than before. 
- Erron black cause ehe gonna yee your last hawww 

I hope this kombat pack is decent just like how we got alien, predator, leatherface, and jason in mks. And Freddy krueger in  mk9. One of Cetrion Fatality is where a claw comes at you at the end and it reminded me a lot of freddy kruger special moves and it makes me happy. Bring in Michael myers, Scooby doo, ash williams, Joker but not the wack ass emo version from injustice, we already know Shang stung is a confirmed character/
My only request is...............MAKE CRASH BANDICOOT A DLC CHARACTER BABY OHHHHYEAHHHHHHHHHHHH

35,51583809,english,"The new big bad in Mortal Kombat is named Kronika, and she's causing a ruckus by messing with time and rewriting history. Characters are getting erased or colliding with their past selves, while alliances are reverting and new ones are being made--it's the kind of chaos that's ripe for conflict. Nothing that happened with Mortal Kombat before really matters anymore; the series is giving itself a clean slate, and not just with the lore in the story. NetherRealm's multifaceted fighting system has been streamlined, and comprehensive tutorials and practice functions are focussed on making sure no matter where you're coming from, you're well-equipped to dive deep into Mortal Kombat 11.

It's hard not to get excited about the story mode in a NetherRealm game given the studio's history of crafting involved narratives, and Mortal Kombat 11 unsurprisingly delivers an entertaining and polished blockbuster-style cinematic experience with its tale of Kronika's time-bending antics. Combat is woven in with a number of cutscenes, though you'll probably spend more time watching well-choreographed action rather than participating. But the story is a great primer for some of the series' more popular characters nonetheless, and the joys of Kronika's time manipulation means that even if you're a passing fan and aren't up-to-date with all of the wacky stuff that's happened in the universe lately, you can still get a kick out of seeing classic versions of familiar faces, who are just as baffled as you about what's happened to their future selves since.

An excellent game if you are looking for a traditional, relatively balanced 1v1 Fighting Game experience, and have someone with a comparable skill level to play with. Story mode is also pretty good. The main reason I would not recommend this game is because of hit-or-miss online connections, awful matchmaking and hilariously high time investment mixed with RNG for the ingame currencies and cosmetics you can get with them. If I'm relatively new to the game, in the ballpark of 10 online games with ~50%WR, there is absolutely no reason why I should get matched up with people sitting at 300+ games and a 75%WR in casual. Many fighting games fall victim to this, so frankly I shouldn't have been surprised.

If you like Fighting Games and are generally good at games in the genre, get this one. It has great characters and attack combos, with incredible visuals to boot.

Yet here we are with pre made models for Cyber-SubZero, Hydro, (Those two are only on a certain map and arent NPCs), Cyrax AND Sektor, yet not a SINGLE ONE is playable!!! Unless this comes out with Kombat Pack 2, I'm gonna have to consider this the worst part of the game. If he didn't include them as NPCs, this wouldn't be an issue, as he had kept his promise.

ORIGINAL REVIEW:

I personally think this is a great addition to the series.

However, there are huge problems with many people and performance.  Many people like myself have huge issues with the game crashing (sometimes every few fights).  I WANT to play this game; I WANT to needlessly throw some extra money at it, but I just can't play the game for more than 15 minutes at a time because of mistakes on the devs part.  And my correspondence with the support ticket boils down to just ""jUsT tUrN OfF yOuR bAcKgRoUnD aPpLiCaTiOnS.""

I have, and it doesn't help.  No, my PC is not the problem.  I play games which demand more and play them at higher settings.

The game runs perfectly fine with my gtx 1060 on med-high settings, the game play is fluid, character design is very tasteful, and the whole title itself feels well polished. When playing locally the game performs extremely well and I find myself getting loss in all the Kombat. The online experience has improved and you are actually able to have intense matches with others in the pc community. There are occasional lag spikes and hiccups here and there, but there are multiple factors that may influence what people determine ""lag"" or ""glitch"", basically online play can be very enjoyable but its fluidity can be affected due to your internet connection and other player visa versa.To Kombat, this the game does have a very intuitive player matching system which finds good stable connections ensuring you a greater chance of having stable matches; this I know is true and I'm very appreciative for. I play predominantly on a ps4 Kontroller and the button layouts, inputs, and my kombos activate as they would on my friends PS4 game. There is support for Xbox, generic steam controllers, and also keyboard so honestly its a win win. In conclusion the game is worth the money and is good representation for what MK and NR fighting games have in store for the future. THIS GAME IS CONSTANTLY getting updates (LOVE FORM DEVS) so please try not to past early judgment on it, thank me later!

After seeing the first trailer during the Games Awards, I was super hyped and pre ordered the game. But Holy Shit is this game infuriating or what.

The way the pc version has been handled is a complete and utter disgrace. We have been waiting for DAY 1 patch fixes that the consoles got.

PC got a patch on Friday, initially this patch was supposed to have platform specific bug fixes, and the two Var Tweaks released for consoles so far: The Towers of Time and the Moveset.

It has been almost a week now that PC players are still having to deal with towers as they were on the day of release.

And it gets worse.

The Towers of Time server-side patch changes two things: a) Bosses have less HP, usually half (from 4000 to 2000) b) Enemy AI uses Konsumables two to three times less often (so instead of a missile every second, a missile every 3 seconds, etc...)

And now the Playstation 4 patch made the towers even ""easier""/""more manageable"", AI spams even less Konsumables, Bosses are more fair.

But on PC, we still got the same exact bosses and Konsumables as day one. This means that the towers are now even harder on PC, as they're being tweaked for an AI that will have less health and use less Konsumables. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you think I'm just being a whiny bitch, Artifact (yes, the game that lost 90%+ of its playerbase and has less than 500 players) made me less angry. Shit, I didn't even write a review for that.

Having done further research, WB and NRS have been atrocious at handling PC ports of MK in the past. Lets hope things change this time

Update: A lot of problems addressed above have been fixed. The game runs quite well on 60 fps. PC patches are more regular now wrt console patches. Game has a good story mode and the fighting is amazing.

Kombat pack is already 50% off and those of us that paid full price have only received the first DLC character just one week ago. Shady AF NRS! Discounting something that people who paid full price haven't even received yet is bull spit.

TLDR I really enjoy the game and haven't experienced any crashing. There are some minor graphical issues still present and Towers of time are still too difficult but should receive a patch soon. The game is great to me up to the 11 hours played mark. I highly recommend it but just be aware that you still run the risk of crashing like some users are still experiencing.

Due to the controversial launch of this game on PC I felt it was my duty to weigh in. Like many Mortal Kombat fans I was burned by the launch of Mortal Kombat X. I vowed not to pre-order another MK game. I held to that vow for the launch of MK 11 and monitored the reviews and forums. Regardless of how bad things got I knew I would buy it eventually. luckily for Nether Realm Studios Mortal Kombat is tied to my childhood. Once the patch dropped and I saw folks confirm some of the issues were resolved I bought the game. Let go through some of the issues people are reporting and I'll let you know my experience with them.

- Graphical issues: I saw evidence of this in screenshots. This was something the patch addressed and I confirm that both TAA and FXAA+TAA are working. That Said I have noticed some blurring in character hair during match intros but goes away as soon as the match begins. I hope they can address this but for me it's a minor annoyance.

- 30 fps issue: This was never a show stopper for me but it is a legitimate complaint. MK X and Injustice 2 have the same functionality so if 30 FPS fatalities and X-rays bother you in MK X they will here too. If they were to allow for menus, fatalities, fatal blows, and krypt to run at 60 fps it would be an obvious improvement. I'm personally not bothered by it and don't feel like it takes away from my enjoyment of the game at all.

- Crashing and Failure to launch: I have experienced none of this. Game ran flawlessly from the start and has not crashed during my initial 11 hours of play time. Just be aware that a fair number of users are still experiencing crashing after the patch so the risk is there that you may too.

- Towers, Grind and Monetization: The devs admitted the Towers of Time were far to stacked against the player and will be addressing it in a coming patch. Because of that I have not bothered with the Towers of Time beyond the tutorial towers. That is an issue and they should have been tuned properly prior to release and unless they had zero QA they released them this way purposely. So far I haven't felt the need to purchase anything on the store and likely won't unless a skin comes up one day that I happen to have enough time crystals for. The Krypt has been enjoyable so far. Definite fan service in there and I love that. If you're selective with what chest you open you can get pretty far in there just during your initial entry. For me that means only opening chest valued at 5k-8k coins. Now that I've just about completed the story my only real avenue for grinding out currency for the Krypt is the Towers of Time and that is where the issue is because of it's difficulty. Again the devs are tuning it and giving everyone currency as an apology. This has not happened yet so buyer beware.

- Story and gameplay: The story has been on par with the previous nether realm games. If you like the story modes in those games you'll like it here. I'm pretty casual so I don't get very indepth with things like frame data, command grab, zoning, etc etc. I just play and pick up whatever combos I can as I go. I personally like the direction they took with the combat. I also really like the addition of crushing blows and fatal blows. Fatal blows, which replaced x-ray, can only be used once per match. I really like this because it prevents instances where someone always only wins because they pull off x-ray every round. I also like that it can only be performed at 30% health so it's this added tension at the end of a round. The customization is nice from an aesthetic standpoint but I don't know how much I really care about grinding out augments for my gear. I like the build your own variation portion too. Should provide some good variety during matches until everyone finds the meta for each character.",1556550382,1561496330,False,0,0,0.49972882866859436,0,True,False,False,76561197968899330,303,2,8434,0,666,1594919397,,

I won't spend time to describe how good the mechanics are, how polished, how balanced, how perfect it feels when you play to it - it's just an accurate modern fighting game doing it perfectly, believe it.

The visuals are excellent, the character design is premium, it runs perfectly on my ""old"" I5 GTX970 

However ...

MK puts an emphasis on the story with a campaign, but the story is as always mostly boring and insubstantial, but still fun to watch because of the quality of the cinematics, or if you like hi budget B-movie (yeah that's a paradox ^^;) 

The violence animations are funny but should be shortened because when you've seen it a couple of times it becomes a bit boring and pace breaking. Not too invasive though

The main disappointement is this new idea of ""boost items"" - mostly found in the Crypt - and the use of many currencies, which means : grind and / or microtransactions. It's not that bad because you can not give a fuck about it, but that's sad because the idea of ""Elite ennemies"" that require special strategy should be super cool but it is very poorly implemented, because meant for grind / microtransactions, because tons of shitty artificial inventory management currencies, but not only : actually the crypt just runs 20 fps on my rig (when the combat game itself run solid 60fps, thanks god) so all that part just feels like an big atrophied limb of the game. It's so bad I can't think of a way to fix it ... Maybe in the next one.

Really Loving this Mk game. It does have minor bugs on patches but they aren't game breaking. The Character customization is next level. Really makes your character feel unique. The random loot in the krypt can be annoying, but it promotes grinding the game and playing towers like the game intended. The amount of brutalities you can unlock make each game played feel different as you try to meet the requisites and kill your enemy in a new brutal way 10 diffferent times. The combos on some characters are harder to connect than others, but when you can pull off a 350-400m dmg combo it is really rewarding. The only thing i truly dislike about the game is the fatal blow mechanic. Fatal blow is when your hp drops below 30% you can use a fatal blow, if it lands you chunk your enemy for 350 hp. The game should have a mechanic for fatal blow, without such high dmg outputs and not just letting you use it if you are low HP. It rewards you for taking too much damage. They are generally easy to block once you learn their engage. That is my only legitimate complaint. Like i said there are some minor bugs, none ive experienced to be game breaking. Well worth the 60$. Alot of content. Each character also has 5 towers for them only. Which unlock unique skins, brutalities, intros, taunts ect. I started scorpion, played all 5 towers and looted 90% of the krypt chests. I own 45/60 skins.. 9/10 brutalities, all intros and all taunts...

I knew I wouldn't be very good at it since I don't have the quick reflexes of youth anymore. I launch the game, grab my Xbox One controller and nothing happened. The game would not accept input from the controller, it would flash between Push [Enter] and Push [A] like it was deciding to use the keyboard of controller, but it wasn't accepting input from either.

Okay, force close, launch it again. This time the keyboard worked, but not the controller. Quit and launch it a 3rd time. Cool, now we're in business. 

Fire up the campaign mode, and it suggests to run through the tutorial. Okay, makes sense, it's been a while, so I'll take advantage. As I'm practicing the moves, the game would occasionally stutter. Weird, but it wasn't too big a deal since it was just the training.

I quit the game, come back and go into story mode and skip the tutorial because well, I didn't have the quick twitch reflexes needed for the special move into combo practice. Watch the cut scene, enter the first fight and the frame rate would drop to 1-5 FPS at times. Now granted, I'm not the best, but when you can't see what's happening to attempt to play. It's rough. I figure it was just some weird glitch, so I give it another go in the story.

BUT WHAT ABOUT THE GAME!?

General:
So far it's my favorite mortal kombat game ever. Obviously theres the typical gripes of ""man I wish (insert character) was on the roster"" but the roster that they have so far feels really good. The game also feels pretty accessible. I would say this is the easiest time I've had learning a fighting game in a long time. Now I play pretty casually so take that with a grain of salt if you are super used to another type of fighting game. 

Story:
Weird and over the top. Goofy and gory. Everything I would have wanted in a new MK story personally. If you are expecting deep storytelling of any kind look elsewhere. However, if you have enjoyed previous MK story modes, it's gonna be a fun time. Nothing mind blowing but still very well put together, with good moments.

Gameplay:
The bread and butter obviously. The game is fantastic as long as it doesnt do something weird. Overall the gameplay is amazing but on occasion iI found weird hiccups even when playing offline. Most memorably, Kotal Kahn's grab where he lifts you over his head and drinks your blood for whatever reason always causes a tremendous slowdown on my game. Every single time. It's never crashed the game but it never fails to occur. All negativity aside though, once you get the hang of a character that fits your style, I guarantee you will be having a blast.

Sound:
The sound is on point as hell. Voice acting is better than any other MK almost across the board. Ronda Rousey as Sonya isn't as bad to me as everyone else seems to make it out to be but its not that great for sure. The crunching of bones and such as crushing or fatal blows are performed and the sound of blunt or sharp objects hitting someone is super satisfying.

Overall:
I love it. For me it may be a 10/10 on the fun scale but if I'm giving it a rating that is appropriate based on its shortcomings, I would have to give it an 8.5. It's awesome if you are a Mortal Kombat fan to begin with and it may change your mind if you were on the fence but if you never enjoyed MK9 or MKX don't look for this one to change your mind.

No mistakes of the previous games have been taken into the account. 
The game is atrocious in terms of balance and gameplay. Not only the developers have repeated (proudly it seems) the mistakes of MKX but they have actually managed to make them worse. Balance is non-existant as before and even worse, some characters get all possble 50/50s and even crushing blows on each of them (Geras) while others get the finger. Some are so good at zoning, that certain characters can never reach them without abilities you must chose. Lag is horrifying is before, PC version as usual will get your keyboard broken, as most abilities will work one time out of three.
My major dislike: the animations are endless, you don't play MK, instead you endlessly watch same 15-20 second animations of fighters getting mutilated in all possble ways. And it may sound fun at first but after you have seen it 10 times it really begins to get on your nerves. 10-15 second animation every fatal blow, 15-25 sec animation of character win stance or fatality...it never ends. I am sure this reduces my game time by half, not that I can afford to play alot in the first place.

Cons: too grindy for my tastes
          no option to unlock everything in the Krypt with real money (not all of us have the time 
          to put in the work)
          it costs souls to wear Kenshi's blindfold in the Krypt. Why?
          too much effort needed to gain those hearts and souls

UPDATE (May 31, 2019): the game has since been patched a couple of times. The server issues still pull me out from certain parts of the game, which is veryl annoying, especially when you're in the Krypt and you want to open a chest. But the good news is that when server issues appear, the game doesn't crash anymore, it only puts me in the main menu, so there's that...

Rubbish. This port is not optimized and the video keeps falling apart during story mode. And what the deal with the jacked up release date sequence?!

New Review:

This game would still be rubbish if the developer and publisher where complacent. But many of the release day issues have since been resolved. Additionally, the depth of the game has been realized after putting in 40 hours. I have literally been deleting other games from the PC because I no there is no point planning to play anything else for the foreseeable future, and I need the extra space of non-gaming stuff. A pretty good outcome it seems. Still on the edge whether I got my full money's worth of $100 pre-purchase, but with the recent announcement of the golden nuggets planned for Kombat Pack 1, I may be making good on the deal very soon.

I'm a huge advocate for the old ways of earning cosmetics in games, like the old CoD days when you'd earn skins for your favorite weapon by using it. This game rewards you In-Game currency for playing literally anything. They also give you the ""Premium"" currency handily by also, just playing the game. Everytime you level up you will receive a small amount.

The premium currency can be bought for money, but I couldn't even tell you the prices for them because never once was I enticed to or pushed upon to by that type of currency. The only purpose for that currency is to have the chance to directly buy an cosmetic/intro/player card that you do not own. The funny thing is I have bought probably 6-7 things from that store & have never purchased the premium currency.

I'm new to fighting games as a whole, but Mortal Kombat in a general sense of marketing & business is amazing, to me at least. Reward a player for playing their favorite character, beating the story, doing towers that rotate every 2 or so hours for a chance to get ANOTHER skin for your character(s). It's a reason to open MK & see what's going on, to see if the skin you want is up for grabs, IF you can beat the tower(s) to gain it.

PC platform and players are treated as second class citizens when it comes to fixes, patches, and communications compared to their console counterparts. 

Kombat League feature delayed THREE times, PC version is behind several patches compared to console version, and the latest patch that had dropped for the consoles are now ELEVEN days (and counting) late, leaving PC players stranded facing frequent desynchronization issues (kicking you out of the current mode you are in, and in some cases, forcibly booting you out to desktop), game performance degradation with previous build managing steady 60fps in-game, now riddled with frequent drops to 40-50fps framerates. 

In-game rewards, advertised as ""AVAILABLE"" in specific modes in the games, after more than a month of playing are actually never made available at all, rendering single player users grinding endlessly within the heavy RNG nature of the reward system with heavy bias towards giving out useless items, not the rewards they're after, just to stretch out player play-time artificially. This comes from my own experience of already clocking around 490+hours into the game.

72,51115006,english,"Update--2 Due to people who know me asking I am going to clarify some points.

The game itself I have no issues with. It is clearly a well made title, had some issues as expected with any release these days but meh. My issues is that without online MP it is basically just digital self gratification (I said it that way because what I really wanted to type gets censored).

Great graphics (though wtf is with no cyborgs yet? The new model looks great so gimme), the combat system remains great and responsive (though for some reason I can only hit a special move 1/3 times despite using the exact right button combo. I primarily play FPS though so maybe my timing is off), kewl unlocks and a story so gloriously ridiculous it is worth of the most badly overdubbed and ridiculous martial arts movie ever (honestly please desync the lip movements and voices to make it seem like this. It would add to the experience I feel). My issue is solely with lack of opponents in my region.

I realize that to a point this is not NR's fault however CROSS PLAY FIXES THIS HERE AND NOW!. I am a PC player on all of my games for good reason but the games I play primarily and stream are based around PC followings. This is fine for FPS (and sports games to a degree, I love Madden) but for a fighting game playing with console players makes the game have a longer lifetime. There is no difference or advantage one can gain over the other (though gaming on a PC means u probably have a decent machine *brag brag* and are willing drop the cash on a decent arcade style controller etc........)  so why does the game not cross play? Functionally there is no reason and the technical implementation is fairly simple (Fortnite can do it so I a AAA release with an $85 AUD price tag can absolutely do the same trick) so why not?

This is my core complaint. Steam insists a game with no available MP matches online is worth the money? I disagree. The single player game I would drop $30 aud on as it is really nice (again whoever programmed and designed this did a good job) but not more than that unless I can show off my skills and unlocks (yes some unlocks should demonstrate that you are just better at the game than others who cannot get them there is no shame in being good at something and practicing or even simply having a really good day) to others online (and I don't mean achi's as who cares unless they play too). 

Update--Not getting a refund so reinstalling it. For 85 bucks I am honestly gonna just grind the crap out of it as a matter of principle. If it improves then at least I should have gotten some practice in.

Ok so I bought this and have requested a refund and here is why. 

The gamje is very pretty, I like the playstyle, it is easy to pick up, the towers are fun and the krypt is engaging, with a little bit of messing around the currencies are easy to get as well. Ok sound good? Here is the bad bit....

The roster gives you a lot of variety ranging from zoners, rushdown, grapplers, mix-up characters and everything in between. Also all the characters who aren't named Kotal Kahn have something going for them like how D'vorah has really good krushing blows despite being 'low tier' and players like AFoxyGrandpa making the most out of what Kung Lao has.

The customization and single player content feels a tad gimmicky, but the sheer amount of cool looking options and unlockables easily distracts you from that. My only wish is that online play had more rewards than just the experience because if you don't take the game as competitively or seriously as I or other people do then you probably won't see the appeal in it, so maybe having unlockables like skin or gear or even just giving you more currency for playing online would be cool for everyone.

Until they fix this, I can't recommend it to anyone, it's to the point where I just stopped playing the game after 4 hours (Edit: More now). One issue is that upon using Light Kick or Light Punch and you're standing at an arms length away and your attacks dont land? and or dont counter the attack the enemy is doing an animation for. So that's just simply one strike for me and this is a common issue in any fighting game. The second issue I have is that in Story the AI has this artificial buffer which makes them appear as being more difficult and or harder to beat. Sounds good right? Nope. The AI just constant grabs, and uses the same attack over and over again to cheese you to death. That's not even difficult / fun thats just like ok... ok.... ok..... ok.... i think i've had enough *Alt f4*

Still not a bad game, I really dislike how they slowed the gameplay down. I dont recommend it unless its on sale. im sorry.

Edit: Over all, this game is fun to play but can be very frustrating at times due to lag / desync         cant recommend the game unless its on sale. Ill still be playing it because I paid 80 dollars for it and im stuck now since i put too many hours into it. But in its current state, stay away.

Additional Review After May 31st Patch:

Well, what do I say, they introduced 60fps on PC which makes the game feel more responsive and it definetly is, so in that aspect they were correct about fixing it. But you would think the game would be 60fps already on PC. And of course, with more frame rate = more responsiveness so its not like they actually did a whole lot.

The game itself is inconsistent as all hell. The AI is trash, it doesnt help you get better at the game at all, it just moves spam when its in a pinch. And frankly you learn more from playing against players who are much better than you, vs... the challenge of AI players.

Honestly, I can't stand how inconsistent the hit boxes are, playing any character, you can literally get into a uppercut duel with the other person as you clip through each other, and same goes for combos, I used Shao Kahns combo on a frost on Towers of time, and like 3 of my attacks literally went through her, for her to spam her ice ball thing with the fatal blow. Cmon man. Im in the Top 94.5% on the leaderboards so before you tell me to get gud (maybe its because no one plays it on PC)

I find myself playing for fun, quickly turning to anger because something should have connected. It would be one thing if they were blocking... but they're not.

Still cant suggest anyone to pay full price for this.",1557007548,1559964098,False,3,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197974822480,448,17,4697,0,167,1589579798,1559228590.0,"Thanks for taking the time to leave a review!

7,50324360,english,"UPDATE from 7th June
So there have been several patches so I came back to see if the game has gotten somewhat better - it definitely did, but its still a thumbs down from me (although still - the core fighting mechanics are great). The main cons that ruin it for me

- still, the one word that gets into my mind is GRIND (all the currencies, unlockables, daily goals, krypt itself, AI fights ....its something I am used to see in free to play mobile games)

- buffs/konsumables - although the buffs have been seriously dumbed down and the towers of time are playble now (compared to what it was when it was released - I still wonder what id... designer could have thought it was something fun back then to create it in such a way), this system is still boring and something that ruins a fighting game rather than enhance it

- fatalities - most of them look boring - kinda comic book like where most of the time the goal is to shred the body into as many parts as possible or completely blow it up, or do something that is supposed to be funny .... but they should be just a brutal way how to kill the opponent. In previous game watching the fatalities sent shivers down my spine, here its more like watching Itchy and Scratchy (some still have that nice brutal touch to them in the beginning, but instead of seeing the victim suffer and die after the killing blow, its instead followed by something ridiculous to completely blow up or mince the body, or show that ""funny"" pose)


ORIGINAL REVIEW
The game itself is really good mortal kombat game, but it is really annoyingly littered with several different extra currencies, tons of boring ""extra"" stuff (consumables etc.) and other stuff that ranks it more into free to play mobile game then a full priced fighting game.

I dont care if such stuff is there, just dont shove it into my eyes all the time and let me play a normal fighting game. But here ... just a few examples
- after each fight comes overview of how much of what currency i earned - this takes more time than the loading time of the fight itself, and there is only a very brief moment when the overview starts when there is an option to skip it - if you miss this very brief moment (sometimes i miss it even when i keep pressing the button right after the winning animation) then you cannot skip it afterwards. 
- The game is promoting the option to skip a fight in a tower, didnt try to find where i can get that token but pretty sure its gonna be through the real money store ... how nice of them to give me the option that i can spend money to finish the towers without even bothering to actually play the game.
- want to ignore our ""great extra fighting game stuff""? then better dont stick your nose into towers of time, cause we have another great stuff there - buffs for the opponents that give them abilities to constantly drain your health, electrocute/freeze you when you hit them, make the screen go dark so you spent more than half of the fight blind ... and i am sure much more similar stuff (i finished only about 2-3 towers and it was so intense fun that i dont plan to go into another one). To me it looks just like a really cheap way to try to force me into using those stupid consumables (and grind to get them), grind to improve equipment, grind to get upgrades that i can put into the sockets in the improved equipment (to boost dmg of that character etc.) .... or to simply pay more real money (actually much more than the game itself costs) to avoid that grind

The saddest thing is that the core gameplay is really good (by core gameplay I mean all the stuff that belongs into a fighting game) .... had the same problem with the last street fighter, only there i used just a free weekend to find out

If I still could I would definitely refund it and wait if they will actually remove this stupid stuff or at least ""hide"" it as something extra that wouldnt try to bother me on every step",1556234441,1559918352,False,3,0,0.509146332740783691,0,True,False,False,76561197987373123,675,33,1408,0,444,1573349322,,

9,51098468,english,"Got the Premium Pack. Horrible User Experience. Was hard to figure out exactly what  characters I got by paying more.  I dont follow MK franchise so I just went off of the information available here on the steam store and what I could find on the main website for the game. I assumed maybe I would get the two locked characters after paying Extra but NOPE still have to arbitrarily unlock one of them through the main story and also I BELIEVE i have to BUY the other character even though i payed a ridiculous amount for the premium pack. The steam store doesnt list exactly WHAT armor pieces/ gear you get for what characters, there is also no clear explanation. Even after looking it up on the site I still dont actually know what gear came with the premium pack. The in game store says I can unlock a character soon early but it doesnt explain how of course. FUN!
The visual quality of the game is pretty awesome. Super well polished and love the overall look. Not a huge fan of the double standards on sexualization of characters. Pretty much all the female characters in the game are either really generic and boxy looking or ugly zombie women. None of them feel like that comic book over the top vibe that goes along well with the ultra gore the franchise has been known for. Meanwhile there are 3 male characters that are half naked. A black man with nippies, a man that resembles a mayan god with nippies, and an australian asshole man with harry nipparroonies.   Going ultra realism with mortal kombat i think is a bad move with the now boring and ""political correctness""  The ultra gore does NOT mix well with the ultra conservative female designs... Stop... really. just... no. find another franchise to push this garbage take onto. It just doesn't make sense here. So what are you saying exactly? Ultra gore is ok but a nice shaped ass on a women is a HUGE NO NO BAD MAN BADDD YOU BAD SHAME ON ME for wanting to see a nice butt while i play my comic book gore video game with man nipples galore.

16,50532198,english,"Originally, I decided I wasn't going to buy this game because people said it heavily resembled a mobile game (Microtransaction City). However, because I love the franchise so much, I decided to ignore the negative reviews and buy the game anyways. Hell, I even bought the deluxe edition AND Shao Kahn. So that's roughly 105 dollars down the drain.

Scores-

Story: 5.0/10 - The story-line in this game is inadequate. When I watched the whole thing unfold for the first time, I was very excited and eager to see where it would go next. It's one of those stories that you'll adore the first time, but begin to see every annoying flaw and horribly-written plot point every re-watch after. Characters that would've most definitely been present in the story were absent, and the whole 'manipulating time [in several ways]' concept was employed so badly it almost came off as random. The only things I can give kudos to NRS for is the pacing of the story, being able to make me respect characters that I never thought I would respect and the absolutely beautiful graphics. However, those do not make up for them wasting the potential of several returning characters. Take Dark Raiden, Frost, Noob Saibot, and Shao Kahn as examples.

Krypt: 5/10 - Again, another horrible let-down. The developers were right to drop the MKX style krypt movement, but they somehow managed to make the krypt the worst part of the game. It is EGREGIOUS. ALL common chests you find around the krypt are randomized. The only chests that are not randomized are chests unlocked with Hearts and Souls. Not to mention that the rewards for donating to the gods almost always suck unless you're spending 75,000 coins or more. I don't even really care that I'm spending a lot to get lackluster rewards, or that getting the coins to do so is a tedious process, it's the randomization that does NOT butter my toast. Then to top it off, when you've unlocked every chest and you're still in need of character outfits, intros, brutalities, fatalities, and victories, you have to spend even MORE coins just to respawn those chests you unlocked to spend MORE coins to get (most of the time) shitty tower consumables and gear augments. But hey, maybe that's just my terrible luck, or this krypt really is the most ridiculous downgrade compared to previous MK games' krypts.

Kombat: 9/10 - This, unsurprisingly, is fantastic. I adore the move-sets for every character and find the general process of learning them fun and easy to do. My only gripe with the kombat is the occasional weird animation or unrealistically quick transition from one move to another. I get that there are other blatantly unrealistic things featured in the kombat, like juggling your opponent, but the transitions between movements should be fluid at the least. Character balance is a whole other issue I don't feel like getting into, but there is definitely a power discrepancy between characters like Erron Black and Shao Kahn.

Training: 9/10 - (Learning frame data, blocking, gauge management, etc...) The tutorials are wonderful for helping new players (and returning) learn how it all works. The only issue I have is that the tutorials for individual characters are lacking and don't really teach you how to do decent combos. Just look for character combo guides on YouTube or go into the training room and see what different combinations of movements you can do with a character's moves.

Online: 8.5/10 - It's pretty much the same as MKX's online except they established an easier-to-navigate menu for finding rooms and KOTH matches. Thankfully NRS did do something about the ridiculous desync issues that would happen randomly, regardless if the ping was great. (If you're still having desync issues then I'm sorry :L)

AI teams: 8/10 - Can be fun. Just depends if you invest your AIs fighting points well. You can use these neat little bots to fight your towers for you, as well as other players' AI teams. It was really something seeing my little shithead Kollector AI destroy the opponent and then proceed to fatality the fuck out of them.
Just a tip for newbies - Invest your AI points into ""Rushdown"" and ""Kombo"" (30 points for each). Having them set in these categories will make it (definitely) easier to conquer towers and (maybe) AI fights.

Kustomization: 6/10 - The kustomization for the roster is also severely lacking in many ways. There's about 60 different outfits for each character, and I know that may seem like a lot, but the truth is is that there's about 4-5 unique designs and the rest are recolors of those outfits. Now, I don't want to be that person, but there is definitely a lack of diversity for the ladies' outfits. I will admit, the story outfits are great and make sense, but there should be more variety after that. Most of the male cast has a shirtless variation, or just more skin showing overall. I'm all for the guys and gals showing some skin, even just bringing back the klassic outfits for the women would be enough. 

New characters: 5/10 - I do like the looks, move-sets, and voices of the new characters, but they just don't live up to to the expectations we had for them. Cetrion and Geras were nothing more than servants to Kronika. Their characters didn't develop, they just followed blindly to the very end. Kollector - and don't get me wrong, I love the guy AND he's my main - adds nothing worthwhile to the story and is also just a servant to Shao Kahn. The dude has more viability as a fucking meme than a kombatant.

Old characters: 7.5/10 - I still love all of these classic characters, but like I said above, they squandered the potential of some of them. Though, I am very glad to see Noob Saibot as a playable again, and boy are his fatalities still just as gruesome.

Gear System: 6.5/10 - I mean... sure?? There's a million different customization options for little things that literally no one is going to be able to appreciate while in game. Like Scorpion's spear? Congrats, have several slightly different designs for it that neither you or your opponent will be able to really notice when actually fighting. Then there's those near-pointless augments you can add to them. Also, experience between gear pieces are not shared, so if you happen to unlock a new piece you find cool and switch to that one, you have to re-level up the gear piece to be able to apply augments again. This would be fine if there weren't like 50+ gear pieces per character.

Kurrencies: 7/10 - Why so many different in-game currencies? It took a good couple of days starting out to figure out just what all of them were for, and now I just don't see why there couldn't have been just 2 types. You have koins, souls, hearts, and time krystals. (not counting fatality tokens, level-up gear tokens, and skip-fight tokens as currencies).

Towers 9.5/10: Towers of Time are typically not difficult to overcome, but sometimes modifiers can be just too rough on the player. But, I do generally have a good time playing through towers and collecting rewards. There are also character specific towers you must spend 25,000 koins to unlock but the rewards for these towers are very much worth the price. You can earn outfits, intros, victories, augments, koins, souls, brutalities, and a couple other things from Towers of Time depending on what towers you're completing. I happen to spend most of my time here. I'm disappointed they did not bring back Test Your Might and Tag-team klassic towers from MK9 but they could add it later.

Overall score: 7.16/10
The game is pretty average in its current state. I'm still holding out for updates that will improve the game significantly. 

Also, NRS PLEASE BUFF MY MAN KOLLECTOR. He needs it real bad :(

Warner Brothers don't even care if it crashes. They will not respond to your tickets. You may have good luck and not get TOO MANY crashes.
If you buy it after reading this, you're on your own. I can't recommend it.

Original Review:

One of the best MK games of all time. Brutal, fun & great graphics. The progression system to get skins and gear is not very good but it got better with the latest patches. The PC port of the game is very good although some improvements may come in the future to fix some minor graphical glitches.
Don't believe the microtransactions lies roaming the internet. There are barely any available. The only real world currency you're going to put in the grind, is time.
The story mode is one of the best ones I've ever experienced in my life.
Scorpion is awesome. Kitana is awesome. Raiden, Liu Kang, Sub-Zero, they're all awesome. And this is just starting. We still have a lot of DLCs incoming in the coming years.
If you're an MK fan, specially from the old days, give it a try. I promise you, you won't regret it.",1556962277,1559701013,False,0,0,0.517241418361663818,0,True,False,False,76561197990117932,269,34,14095,0,8183,1582302406,,

Now Fan Boy opinions aside:

Mortal Kombat 11 has a very well balanced (except you Geras) roster with tons of different abilities to change variations to how you want to play. You're no longer forced to play a certain way and have more Kreativity, of course competitive gameplay has its fixed variations but that's how it has to be. The Kombos are Klean and just a lot of fun to land and master. The game is ported very well and game play is very smooth. Also, as in many MK games, it has its quirks like the online is a little unstable at the moment but it has been getting better as I keep playing. Like it normally should so i'm not to worried about that. The outrage over micro-transactions is overdone almost all huge games with a online base has micro-transactions. Especially with the amount of variety when it comes to customizing your fighter. This is what NetherRealm did well in Injustice 2 and very well in this game. It's also a just a very fun fighting game like come on it's Mortal Kombat you can never go wrong with that. I promise you'll find someone you like to play and want to learn them.

47,51008897,english,"This review is based on the use of NVIDIA G-Sync and a GTX 1060 3GB as well as a score from 1 to 10 with 1 being the worst and 10 being the best.

Graphics:

At first glance, I was given a warning about flashing lights and epilepsy.  That is a very smart thing to insert, because there are many people who don't truly understand that they will get headaches or dizziness from this.  The menus looked really crisp with detailed Anti-aliasing.  The game suggested that I increase the filtering, but I wasn't sure if the NVIDIA profile would match or cause issues like flashing or as such.  The stages have so much depth and detail that I was more than impressed.  What really won me over in graphics is the detailed animation from the characters from the Fatal Blows.  Most people's demonstrations or live streams only showed the Fatal Blow at 30 fps, but they were stunning with G-Sync at 60 fps.  Overall, a job well done with Mortal Kombat 11 just like the previous two.  I gave this a 10.

Gameplay:

I went directly to the practice room and started playing with Sonya Blade.  Most people were stating that it felt slow, but it has a very nice pace of execution when performing combos unlike MK X.  With every button press with my wireless XBOX One controller on the PC brought an extremely fast response.  The characters who doesn't flip brings an unusual way of performing a crossover; it felt like I was floating, but I was alright with that one.  Executing the Fatalities was very simple and easier to remember in this game.  I always mark the digital downloads minus one here because they love relying on Steam's communities to make a manual.  It can be in the form of a PDF or Word document or even a website that just reiterates things like controllers, warnings, character bios, some pics, or a notes page.  Most people today will not mind to not have a manual, but with the amount of work placed into mechanics, leaving out an official manual, but selling a master guide is a small disappointment.  The fact that I am a fan favorite of this and it kept the traditions of being secretive (such as finding Reptile in MK 1) with the unbelievable Krypt made me disregard any new traditions in gameplay. I will give this a 10.

Controls:

I used my XBOX One controller for the PC and the movement was very fluid without any hiccups.  Navigating through the menu to observe the move list or to scroll up and down was smooth with each execution.  The characters moves were all simple to execute even under pressure.  There were not any jerky controls nor any delay in the combos when applied.  I gave this a 10.

Sound:

I like the style of sound they used, which sounded more Arabic with a bit of symphony added.  Each stage had a sound that represented it's look and I like that.  As you move back and forth through a stage, it has a soft, but epic movie like sound and the tempo was dramatic with each Fatality.  The composer, Wilbert Roget II, placed his creativity from the past Star Wars games into this one.  I gave this a 10.

Replay Value:

While most will play the Story Mode and call it quits, I have been playing the regular modes as well as the Krypt.  I love watching the Fatalities, Fatal Blows, or discovering new artwork that shows the developers ingenuity and creativity.  Playing with friends online is always a plus and I will keep playing this time and time again.  I gave this a 10.

Augments are a great idea to add some novelity to it, but again, locked behind a level of randomness that will prevent you from obtaining what you want in a reasonable time.

The game is still the most massive grindfest I've ever played in my life, and I say this after spending years playing WoW : at around 3 hundred hours I've unlocked most of what basically is the easier half to obtain portion of all the cosmetics in the game.
The other half is locked behind timed events which would probably take years of your time to complete, both because they are numerous, both because you actually have to wait for them to appear in the first place, and because of their random nature there's no telling when that'll happen.
Customization options are also extremely diluted and uninspired, for a game which made these one of their selling point.

The game's still far from optimized : the krypt won't run at 60 unless you're running it on some extremely high end setup, and graphical glitches are basically everywhere to be seen : it's all minor stuff but it's not the quality you'd expect from a triple A ttle like this

I'm also not the only one who has complained about the roster, since it's pretty common for people to be unable to find a suitable main : dlc, as far as I know, won't fix that for me.
If you're like me, expect to jump from a character to another not because of interest, but because the previous one just ""lacked something"".

79,50961748,english,"This game gets shit on way too much. This game deserves better.

The only reason it really tends to get bashed is because of the 30fps in menus, intros, etc. However people praise X for being the best game, yet it also had the 30 fps lock. I fail to see how it's that big of an issue if X had it too?

Secondly, the it gets bashed for the grind. I'll admit, the grind is crazy. I don't think that's a huge thing to hit 11 down for though. The grind deserves to be fixed though I'll agree.

Third I'll admit the game is a bit overpriced. There's no reason for the kombat pack to be 40$, and releasing Frost DLC was a bit scummy. I bought the DLC as I wasn't in a story grindy mood until now. Plus to release a character as a DLC which is already in the game for anything more than 2$ is overpriced. 

Fourth, the microtransactions exist yes. Should microtransactions be in full-priced games? Probably not. Do game developers need to make money? Of course. 

While it is very frowned upon to see microtransactions in a game priced this high, I don't really blame them for it. There is an insane amount of unlockable cosemetics and it is a viable source of revenue. So I don't see it as that big of an issue.

Finally, my last thing is that PC gets updated way slower than console. While this does suck, there is most likely a reason behind it. Console is where all of their playerbase so they'll update there first. There really isn't a reason why they can't release the update for console and PC at the same time though.

-----

Would have loved to recommend this game. The initial launch problem with the super grindy stuffs had been fixed with the patches but even after that I wouldn't recommend the game, not because of the grind but the stupid ""server"" issues.

The game will kick you out not to just the menu but will just shut down your game and you have to relaunch the whole thing and this happens every 6-7 matches. Having to go online for all the single player modes is silly enough but to kick you right out where you're still playing and doing your combos is just straight up unnecessary. The game requires you to be online every second while you're playing even though it's a 100% single player content. The ""issue with server, the game has to shut down"" thing happens way too often it's actually unplayable. Nothing ruins your flow more than having fun and the game forcing you to restart. It's been like this since day one up to this point. There is no way I could do the 8 matches towers or endless mode because the game won't let me play for more than 6-7 matches straight. If you're interested in MK11 get it on other platforms because the PC version is obviously broken. Several patches and this issue still is not fixed.

I do love this game and I enjoy playing it except for some little problems. First, I get queued with players from different countries. Me and my friend have this problem where we just get queued with people from different countries and with people with high ping in to 200 to 250 and it makes it really annoying because there is a huge delay with attacks and really can make you mad. Second is the story. The Story is fine but It really messes up the mortal kombat timeline and its dumb in general. Netherrealm could've done some things differently and made it more intresting and fun. It's fine but they could've done better with it. Third is Jax's ending. His is the most retarded thing about this game and I don't know how they thought it was such a good idea to put it in the game. It really destroys jax's personality and what makes him into the metal armed soldier we know today. Last thing is that they need to fix some things like where I am hitting Square or X when Im getting back grabbed but the game gives me the middle finger and doesn't want me to tech. I tested it on practice and it works but for some reason it doesnt work in my matches. it could be that I am tapping at the wrong time but I swear, I know I am. My final sentence is that NetherRealm need to polish it more up and fix some things.

For Story mode, this is probably one of the best story mode that you could have in a fighting game... if you just want the skins that it drops, it wont take more than a day to finish the game because most cut scenes are Skippable. 

For MK 11 micro-transaction, it is actually isn't that bad as people thought it is. you can still access the brutalities even not having it in the move list  and  most of the fatalities are already unlocked anyway so there's nothing to complain about this game. for skins ,yes you have to grind a little bit but you don't need to spend money for buying the in game currency to do it. (skins are just for aesthetic anyway it doesn't give you any extra boost to the game that give you the edge)

I do recommend buying just the normal one instead of the premium pack because most of the top tier character are already on the base game. you can buy kombat pack later on the game

[spoiler]TL DR: If you don't like PvP, and you're more of a casual player(when it comes to fighter games) like I am, but still enjoy Mortal Kombat and you're semi-competitive, there's nothing for you in this game. The PvE aspect of the game is complete stinky horseshit and game is online-only.[/spoiler]

Warning: This review is a semi-well constructed ramble and I haven't even said all that is in my mind, nor all of that could be said as I didn't get to explore every aspect. But I still had lots to write.

I would say MK11 is among B. I like it. It's rendered unplayable for me though, so I'll criticise some really [b]ugly[/b] parts of it here. I'll replace it with praise if all the problems I've mentioned are fixed.

[list]
[*] The main menu, stuttering and performance issues
You've bought the game, you're excited. Clunky, weird menus greet you. OK. Cool. Doesn't matter too much. If you're like me, the first thing you do is play the story mode. Thankfully, tagging is a thing in MK now, so you don't have to play Cassie Cage without knowing any of what she does. You're glad about that part, [b]but you notice the game is heavily stuttering. Your FPS counter shows 60 fps stable. The ingame configuration shows 59.70 fps average. But no. The game is stuttering like a mfa.[/b] This is, I'm assuming, a combination of some bad optimization, and [b]Denuvo.[/b] I hate Denuvo, it's pointless- and you're wrong. It's arrogant to say that, but I can't say much here.

[*] The Towers of Time
You're done with the Story. You either thought it was a cliche mess or you enjoyed it. I enjoyed it, even though it has its holes.
1 - Local matches versus your best buddy or CPU. (Grants you nothing, like always)
2 - Towers of Time for rewards
3 - The Krypt to unlock gear and all the juicy stuff you'd want to customize your characters
4 - AI battles
5 - Okay, listen, you have options. 

Let's assume you play Towers of Time next.

Fun towers with modifiers tailored to give you an enjoyable experience! Not. I hopped on this mode, thinking I'd get to enjoy the game and earn rewards in the meanwhile. No. 
>They thought it's a good idea to put modifiers on EVERY BATTLE. 
>THEN, they thought it's a good idea to make EVERY MODIFIER a TAG ASSIST, ARENA HAZARD, or your opponent getting HYPERARMOR... or just, they get to FREEZE YOU, because you stood next to them for two seconds. Then they get a full combo off it.	
>They designed 3 v Boss Co-op events where you fight a 7500 HP boss. I played it- and here's how my first experience went- I was first to fight, I dealt 4500 damage, then I was depleted. Cool. 2 allies to play after me. Easy peasy. No, the boss gets to critical HP and then the whole arena lights up dealing 100 damage per second to them or something. I literally didn't understand what's going on in the screen.
>All I know is, [b] THE TOWERS OF TIME ARE FULL OF THINGS THAT MAKE THE 50% OF DAMAGE YOU TAKE BE NOT FROM YOUR OPPONENT, BUT VARIOUS OTHER THINGS, WHICH IS DUMB. [/b] 
>Then, the rewards are just low, the items are RNG, this, that, other people have whacked this point across already. It's not worth your time. It's not worth the frustration. There's, how many currencies in the game?? I don't know! Too many for me to remember while writing this!
> Other people will go into more detail about how harder towers need a ton more consumables and rare gear to complete. It's MTX bait.

[*] The Krypt
This is completely subjective, but I don't want a 3rd person horror/puzzle game to unlock items in a fighter game. The puzzle part is fine, but I scare easy. The end result is me completely avoiding Krypt (like I did in MKX), which is probably the reason the game's filesize is so large since they opted for a 3rd person exploration game for the section where you just UNLOCK things... .... Not to mention the grind it takes to get through this bad boy, all the jumpscares. Remember MK9? They made a Krypt. You unlock things fast and smooth. Nice. You might have encountered the Krypt Monster, which is a jumpscare, that is predictable by footsteps, and is a very rare occurrance. Yes. They thought, ""let's make that little troll a full fetched 3rd person exploration game"". It's just so fucking stupid.
Also, remember. Most of the time you're going to unlock concept art. Remember when those were in collector's edition boxes of physical copies, and not your currency fodder in the game? Currency fodder... in your already, extremely grindy, game?
EDIT: FULLY OPENING ALL CHESTS IN THE KRYPT DOESN'T EVEN GIVE YOU ALL THE KRYPT REWARDS. YOU HAVE TO ""REVIVE"" THE BOXES AND OPEN THEM ALL OVER AGAIN. ADDITIONALLY, THERE IS A SHRINE WHERE YOU ""DONATE"" 75k AND 100k FOR RNG GEAR/SKINS)

[*] Customization and AI Battles
Customization in this game is divided into 4 appearel: Your general costume, then three items according to your character. Cool. You have lots to choose from, even if most of the costumes are just recolors of other ones (That, I find stupid. Red Kitana? Blue Jade? Green Skarlet? What's next, Pink Scorpion? Alright...) Then, there's your character's intros, taunts, some fatalities. And there's a section where you choose your character's special moves! No more, ""oh, this variation has 1 thing I like, the other has 1... what... do I do..."" - as you just get to make your own, and enjoy.

Then, there's AI battles. There's two things that come to mind: AI Battles, just, any gamemode where you can allow an AI to play instead of you, and the actual AI Battles gamemode, where you pit 3 of your designed AI against another's 3 designed AI, which is all about tailoring your AI's special moves and tweaking (60 points to Grappling, Rushdown, Kombos, Reversal, Zoning and Runaway) to counter the other team and also synergize with the character itself and the specials you chose for them. I like this idea a lot.

But this takes a dark turn. Customization is ruined by the fact there are 5? 6? Whatever amount of different currencies, the entire game is a shameless, MTX bait insufferable grind. AI Battles gamemode is ignored, and people, if they do use AI, just tailor their AI to beat Towers of Time for them. I just wanted to try it out myself, and it's the entire reason I'm writing this goddamn review. My Skarlet AI is destroying the towers with her mad kombos that I can't imagine to pull, and playing the game for me. The AI implementation just turns out something that players use to do the insufferable grinding for them while they do something else. Why do I use the AI? First of all, I don't like PvP. I play it here and there, but most people would beat me. That was the case for 9 and 10. But here, it doesn't even matter if I meet someone with the same skill level, they just abuse Scorpion, Noob and Erron Black to win, just, hear this point out from someone else. They're overtuned and/or annoying. So, Online isn't an option for me because I don't enjoy it. I don't do Local Matches because I don't want to just not get anything for the time I played the game. I don't do the Krypt because I don't like the jumpscares. I only have Towers of Time. And they get insufferable. It could be fun, I'm not that bad at the game! But it's just tailored not to be fun! Delibrately! So you buy MTX! So the ONLY OPTION...


.... IS TO LET THE GAME PLAY ITSELF. I CAN'T PLAY IT. NOT WITHOUT EVENTUALLY GETTING FRUSTRATED. HEY, AT LEAST MY SKARLET AI IS LITERALLY 2-0'ING EVERY OPPONENT IF THEY DON'T HAVE THE PROXIMITY FREEZE THING, GUYS.

[b]NOTE: I'm not criticising the AI being effective. That's a good thing- to carefully design and tweak your AI and go attagirl when they kick ass! The problem is that this is my only option, and likely will be your only option aswell.[/b]

34,50847846,english,"Hmm. This game. It's a game demonstrating that NetherRealm has become more insidious and cares less about their product than I previously thought possible with the reboot and the original Injustice being so great;Those were just simply fighting games with great stories and everything else was just an after thought, though not an intrusive one. Ever since those initial releases the games have come with an increased cost and more extensive monetisation. Combat stays mostly the same with minor changes and the stories shrunk into less invigorating shells of what was once achieved. It is clear that NetherRealm is now a true developer of Warner Bros. and cares not but for what the publisher can extract from you, whether it be your money or your time.

Gameplay
This is where I'm divided. I can't decide whether I like the new mechanics and slower pace or not. It is so frustrating and rewarding at the same time. Though I would honestly say more frustrating just because of the type of play it has encouraged from online players. The crushing blows look cool and can lead to huge damage if used in a combo;But they are rarely used this way and just become something that is almost abused. I say almost because it only allows one per game but yet you see players spam the move set or upper cut or grab over and over again even if it's been used. The grabs are also annoying. The animation time is a lot faster and they replaced just pressing the grab and forward or backward with down 1(A) and up 2(Y) making it much harder to escape and consequently it is abused as well. The full screen size is larger than in MKX making zoning harder to punish or move in on, coupled with the slower pace and heavy focus on the new crushing blows can make some games one move set, a projectile and the grabs for a long time as you try to move in on opponents. This new style has just made the game sort of boring online for me. After four hours I achieved a 49-19 win/loss ratio and most of those battles were long and drawn out instead of the fast paced aggressive combat I have come to expect from Mortal Kombat.

The Krypt And Monetisation
This part to me is all bad because it encompasses so much of the game. It is literally in everything you do from the story, towers, online to walking the krypt. The in app purchases while not necessarily abundant are increased from previous games which is disappointing. I am tired of seeing premium currencies and it is even more frustrating in a fighting game. What is also frustrating in a fighting game is crafting, consumables and RNG loot boxes. This isn't Battlefront or an rpg mobile game. I don't want to spend hours grinding consumables to open chests and grind towers that allow me to grind more consumables to grind more towers and then do it all over again. The cosmetic customization ends up tied in here because it is only achieved through this grind or the rng based storefront. At least Injustice 2 only had a few paid skins and then just basically threw loot boxes at you and handed out gear like candy. You still didn't get what you wanted a lot but it was far better than this is. The krypt is boring and filled with pretty boxes that on average give you nothing and take tons of the three currencies in the game to unlock and because it is randomized like Injustice you rarely get anything you want for the character you actually play. Yes I said three currencies. It is pathetic. So expect to grind for a long time to get a nice set and all the augments to go do some more grinding in the towers. Then roll all the chests again so that you can open them all again to do it all again. Repetitive right? It wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't asking you to buy Frost or advertising the storefront all the time, or if going into the krypt wasn't a frustrating mess of consumables and currencies and blah blah blah. Huh, it's bad, it's frustrating, it's time consuming and I hate it.

I play mostly on the Xbox with a friend of mine and that is where I completed the story. I got it on pc because I wanted to test a more modern game with the 2080 ti. If I hadn't played for four hours on pc I would have refunded it because it wasn't worth it. The ok story, over all slow and somewhat stale combat , combined with the ever looming and mind numbing krypt that is accompanied by and helps bolster the increased monetisation of the game has made this a lesser game than previous NetherRealm titles in my mind. Also noting that the season pass was $40 for just six characters or $100 altogether is just so bad. They are charging more and raking in more money for what amounts to 33% percent Mortal Kombat and 66% krypt, consumables and gear considering that's where it feels like most of their time went. That last 1% is NetherRealms' integrity just blowing out the window.

This is just my opinion and that should be remembered. I personally don't like how games are currently being handled and find it sad that it has seeped into even the fighting game genre and taken over.  You may like this game or you may not but I can't personally recommend this game.",1558829409,1558829409,False,3,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,76561198020391437,306,15,1035,0,405,1566777320,,

48,50819535,english,"Now I am not simply going to disregard people who do have issues with their copy of the game. So I can only tell you from my own experience that I am highly impressed by this game. I run this game on an Radeon RX480 4GB and Intel i7 7700k and it runs smooth as butter no matter what. In all the hours I've put into this game the only time it has crashed on me was on day 1 only one time when I was navigating character customization and that was after I had already put in 8 hours and was messing with the menus for and hour and a half. Since then I've had ZERO issues, whenever I've been disconnected it was from my own internet not NRS. The gameplay is absolutely addicting, the visuals are amazing, and for a fighting game has a fackton of content. However the problems I do have with it are:

1: You cannot earn anything in the game without being connected to the internet. It's extremely anti-consumer and this needs to go.

2: You cannot choose what unlocks you want unless you spend crystals to get them

3: Even if you have the crystals to buy what you want, you still have to wait for the in-game store to randomly refresh its RNG content of like 5 items that can be purchased which it like 12 hours or some bs.

4: Aside from a select few 15-25k koin chests and ""heart"" chests the whole crypt is random and filled to the brim with chests that 85% of the time just give you konsumables just to farm more in the towers of time. And even if you do get a skin or gear piece, collectively there are over 3,000 unlocks which means that the chances of you getting what you want from the krypt is approximately less than 1 in 3000, if every chest had only 3 gear/skins it would be less than 1 in 1000 due to the konsumable diluting it even more.

5: Serious grind.... Like a lot. Even post patch its abysmal still for an unknown reason because you cannot buy boosters or do anything to help you get along, heck you can't even be a whale if you wanted to because you're restricted to just 5 or so items a day in the store. Its a free to play grind for apparently no reason but just to be there to annoy you, like really, it's not like you can spend money to skip it because you can't. It's got to be the most bizarre design choice I've ever seen in a game. 

6: Burnout, just utter burnout, the towers of time are a fun concept but gets irritating really quick, its really the only best way to get koins and even then you usually have to fight through multiple towers just to get a net profit of maybe 45k koins which all turn to konsumables in the krypt in a heartbeat. It gets extremely boring really fast and the AI reads your inputs like a mofo, its a serious downgrade from the MKX AI. Their idea of difficulty scaling AI down is just increasing the time intervals between when the AI reads your inputs and doesn't. In other words they'll beat your ass and then just stand there long enough for you to dish out damage, they stand there longer the easier the difficulty, so essentially no matter the difficulty all the AI acts the exact same, it's just the harder AI's are just more impatient.

7: Even though there's approximately 3.5k ppl at any given time, in this game online is an utter wasteland. I shyt you not on a Saturday mid-afternoon all the ""rooms"" (y'know those lobbies you can join) combined have like a total of 20 players. TWENTY! I think its really because of the towers of time, everyone is always playing them.

8: The cosmetics are a serious downgrade compared to injustice 2, in injustice 2 you have 5 pieces of gear for different parts of your character each part having 20 options, most of which were really awesome because you essentially got to create your own skin for your character... not in this game. In this game it's actually pathetic which it kind of a slap to the face since the gear system was essentially and experiment in IJ2 but for some reason it was downgraded for an IP that they can go fuq all on without restriction. You get ~30 pieces of head gear, most of which have lame simple designs, maybe 8-10 are cool, ~30 for a secondary gear like a knife or sword that you can barely even see, and ~30 for other pieces you can't even see at all and aren't even used (looking at you skarlet vial and everything besides the masks on frost). There are ~60 skins per character BUT, I said BUUUTTTT, what it REALLY is is just 4-6 skins that have been reshaded with different color schemes, 3-5 of the skins being also lacking in design and bad ass ery MK is known for. So instead of making your own bad ass skin and picking color schemes the color schemes are tied with skins and for the most part are really boring. You'd think they'd up the ante with this feature but they went straight 10 steps back. Again, most of these skins are rng in the krypt too. So its a double slap in the face because it was a grind to get them... and they suck (mostly).

Story mode is a shitshow of fanservice and its fucking awesome, end of story. Still trying to not rage that the cyborgs again were left off the base roster since 2011 (DLC doesn't count triborg!) 8 years and the tekunin still nowhere in sight, they probably would have had the best kustomization too. sorry for the brief rant, getting tired of these pie face spec ops fools filling the roster, we need more ninja shyt. 

And surprisingly so far, PC support has been SHOCKINGLY good, every week or other week there have been significant updates to the game with fixes and minor additions, the latest being the 60fps unlock for, well, everything, suck it consoles. 

Oh and for the burka kombat controversy, fuck it skarlet still got the dem mnice mperkey tiddiez and hipz mah G

In my case, the keyboard randomly stops responding, and the audio is constantly crackling. I can't even use the consumables either because it requires me to press jump at the same time as the item hotkey... which can't be done because it forces my character to jump.

Then there's the ridiculous grind for gear. You'd need 2000+ hours of gameplay before you get the items you want because it's an endless fuckfest. But don't worry, most of the Brutalities you unlock don't even work anyway (Geras, Raiden to name just two).

The PC version is also over a week behind the PlayStation's balance patch too.

The fighting itself though is good... so there's that?

Finally the PC was patched to the same as the Playstation version. The currency drop rate was approximately tripled, and the towers nerfed. Still, the game repeatedly bugs out my keyboard, crackles the audio, and a lot of the brutalities are still broken. If these could be fixed, I would change to recommended.

54,50814140,english,"I'll start with the bad

While I must be one of the few who enjoy the grind because this keeps me coming back and gives fresh rewards sometimes , there's no denying that the game has it's flaws
Some of the opponents in the Towers of time are cheap (cheap as hell), but come to think of it, this has always been an MK mark. Remember Goro from MK1? Kintaro & Shao Kahn from MK2? Motaro in MK3? Yes, it's been patched and now skill matters as much as loot (consumables)
The customization is sub par. Yes, you can change skins, but there aren't that different or that interesting (mostly colour variations) , not compared to Injustice 2 customization (which was also limited). I would have preferred more variety in this.
The last thing I don't like (as you can see there aren't so many) is some of the character designs, especially compared to MKX. MKX was dark, this.....well Sub-zero looks like the apprentice of the MKX version just to give an example.  

Now unto the good parts
Graphic are top notch. The arenas look amazing, so much detail. Character animation is amazing 
The fighting system is the best (imo) and I have quite a few fighting games to compare.
Fatalities are a delight as expected and the fact that you can tweak your character's specials is also a big plus
Story mode.....now this is the biggest plus I can give. I've been a (big) fan of MK from the first one, but this .... this was amazing, outstanding, flawless (for a MK fan). Netherrealm Studios has done another amazing job of storytelling in a fighting game and if you enjoy MK lore you will not be disappointed (this is not Game of thrones, it actually has closure)
Has one of the best tutorials. Want to learn a character? no problem. Want to learn to count frames? no problem. Everything is there.

Positives= 
-Fantastic tutorial system (if youre unfamiliar with fighting games the tutorials will take you from scrub to special move cancelling hero).  

-Great visual variety with the alternate color themes, each character has several skins and tens of recolors of those skins, plus tons of hats, masks & weapons etc. If you play the towers of time for hours you really appreciate having that variety so youre not looking at identical images all day.

-Towers of Time are a great way to PVE for rewards & cosmetics. Ive had a lot of fun learning all the different effects I can encounter in ToT & learning what change in play style is needed to beat it, or which konsumables I need to use. 

-Story mode is very entertaining, & not too short, its average time to finish is 8 hours, but ToT is what keeps you coming back. I love figuring out the ToT meta game while I get good at the game & learn some characters so I can go into pvp more confidently. 

-The multiple currencies and the krypt are not issues, they are easy to get, and fun to use while you explore and discover secrets in the krypt. Initial comments about them were knee jerk reactions from youtubers looking for the next controversy. NRS has always hidden stuff in their games for fans to discover, there are ways you can find particular unlockables without random chance, just look on reddit. And the only thing real $ can do is buy cosmetics from the shop. And the items in the shop rotate daily. And you get that currency to use in the shop for free while playing. Its only 'grindy' if you want EVERYTHING, & theres so much damn cool stuff that if you actually play the game youre swimming in cool items, just not every single cool item in the game, which you wont need..  

-NRS and Qloc have been patching the game for consoles and PC to improve known issues, and theres been communication over discord & steam forums consistently to inform the community about timeframes, & what to expect. The level of communication gives confidence that updates & bug fixes should continue to come. 
 
Negatives= 

-At launch anti-aliasing was giving me all kinds of jagged edges and muddy textures. But patch notes since launch say thats being seen too. Jagged edges are gone, textures are crisp. There are some other minor visual issues that came up after that patch but I expect they are known & being worked on too. 

-Towers of time had a steep difficulty curve at launch, because new players have so few konsumables, and during the first days nobody knows that there are items which will directly counter the hostile effect added to the fight, or that you can use items to heal damage to even up the fight against enemies with extra health. Balance changes have made Towers fairy tame and easy to handle. Plus I've stocked up enough konsumables to get through anything in towers of time. Some towers have a Brutal difficulty you can unlock, so there is some challenging pve if you look for it, but the daily towers of time are fairly easy.

- 30fps cutscenes and krypt ...  *Edit** USED to be a problem. But less than 3 hours ago they patched in a 60fps option for the krypt, menus, character intros, krushing blows, fatal blows, and brutalities. Its fantastic.

No more super bullshit towers, you get more koins and hearts for doing stuff, the game doesn't crash anymore and just now they added 60 FPS mode. I can safely say now, that this game is worth playing, because it's honestly the best MK game released to date. 

Yes, the game is quite grindy in terms of cosmetics and stuff like that, but it's not as bad as everyone says it is. Back then - yes, it was awful, but now it's fine. However, I still do not recommand buying the Frost character pack, you get her 100% for free after few chapters of the story, like 1/4th of it.

63,50297531,english,"It is clear most of this game is just made for the money. The towers of time are still too hard even though they have brought down the difficulty. They did seem to be okay and better for a while, but recently it seems the difficulty has gone up again and that is because they probably want you to buy cosmetics through the micro-transactions instead of unlocking  them. The krypt is now randomized and annoying as heck because of that. It gives me random crap I dont want like consumables and items and concept art. Speaking of consumables, who asked for them? Certainly not me. They make matches very frustrating especially in the towers of time. Sure in MK X there were modifiers, but they were optional. In mk 11 you pretty much have to use them to counter other ones and win. Also why is there just a mode where you watch AI characters you customize fight with other people's Ai characters online? That's an other thing, You cant really get a skin you want. It's all random. There's also a lot of little stuff that annoy me such as Scorpions spear now does not make someone dizzy for a second anymore. The tutorial is good. The controls feel weird and worse then MK X. The graphics are good, but have little options to turn them down making it so a lot of computers can not run the game smoothly. (So i had to buy it again for ps4 and put over 30 hours into that one) There a few issues with the story, though I wont spoil it. The story mode overall is really good and feels like you're watching a movie, but leaves out key characters such as Reptile and acts like they dont even exist! Reptile! Also the krypt is pretty enjoyable to go through and komplete all the puzzles, but some puzzles you can not complete without playing the game for hours and hours! This game does not respect your time. I've got other things to do then sit around getting 50 fatalities on every character... 

Overall Just go and watch the story mode on youtube, the rest of the game is not worth it. Also go play MK X after you are done watching the story, it's a far more superior game.",1556098458,1558688439,False,14,0,0.47306746244430542,0,True,False,False,76561198094226278,501,14,78,0,72,1556099479,,

66,50755572,english,"I've previously enjoyed Mortal Kombat (at least the reboot series, I haven't played any of the older ones) for the story and characters much more than the gameplay. It's fun to see all these bizarre creations working together and becoming friends, but the gameplay is weird and I didn't want to touch it any more than I had to. With Mortal Kombat 11, however, I decided to see if I could learn to play it despite that weirdness. While I'm still bad at it, it seems like something I could really get into, and it's fun regardless. The story's expectedly good, too.

The main hook of Mortal Kombat 11's plot is time travel. The main reason for this is to undo a lot of the less fun or more unpopular elements of the reboot plot by bringing back old versions of characters and having them work with their new versions. It's actually a ton of fun, and deeply satisfying to boot. These characters just get along, work together, learn that they have common interests after fighting for years and years and then develop a mutual understanding. It's really heartening, and specific cases range from just entertaining to actually really sweet. The unadulterated love and mutual respect between Young Kano and Old Kano is really lovely, and seeing Young Liu Kang and Young Kung Lao be snarky and fun is a nice change. Kitana also gets a really fucking cool plot where she [spoiler] becomes the new Kahn through a combination of smart diplomacy and fucking blinding Shao Kahn in a fight [/spoiler] that's really cool. It's just wall-to-wall fan service, in the best possible way. The only real letdown is the ending, which [spoiler] undoes all of this world development in favor of just letting Liu Kang and Kitana rewrite the universe after it gets unmade. I would've liked to see this world continue to develop, [/spoiler] but at least with this writing team I'm sure they'll make something good out of whatever comes of it.

Oh, and Ronda Rousey as Sonya Blade is awful for a variety of reasons. Bring back [checks quickly] Tricia Helfer, she was actually good at the role. Oh, hey she was in Rick and Morty too, that's kinda nea‚Äî

Anyway, the gameplay is also interesting. Mortal Kombat 11 is extremely idiosyncratic as 2D fighting games go, with its block button, strings instead of links, weird juggles, non-cancelable crouching attacks, ability to duck throws and command grabs, mid-hitting jumping attacks, and a bunch of other stuff, and that takes some getting used to. I'm still certainly learning how it all works, but it actually feels good, and like it'll all make perfect sense once I get the hang of it. I want to get better at the game, which is always a lovely feeling. I look forward to getting good and actually being able to enjoy Mortal Kombat.

Finally, the presentation aside from the story is generally excellent. The arcade mode endings are a lot of fun, the animation seems to have improved significantly, the characters feel more differentiated and fleshed out, the Fatalities are often creative and funny instead of just straightforward torture porn (although I wish I could say the same for the Fatal Blows), and the pre-fight intros are in top form. The game just has a fun-loving feel to it.

Yeah, overall, Mortal Kombat 11 is a very good time, and a great use of your money. Check it out.

3,50741608,english,"Mortal Kombat 11 is a highly polished fighting game and all gameplay features are unlocked by purchasing the game. The fighting style is far more similar to MK9 than MKX, with the removal of the run button and meaning that controlling space and footsies in general become more important than ever. And yes, fatalities (and brutalities) are back and they're better than ever.


Learning the strengths and weaknesses of each character has always been necessary for online matches and the game features the most in depth interactive tutorials (all of which are optional) ever seen in a fighting game. Offensive strategies, Defensive strategies, Frame data and new mechanics are all explained fantastically here. Character specific tutorials give a brief intro to each character, showcasing their best strings and special moves and provides descriptions into when they should and should not be used.

Picking up from the end of MKX, the story mode is top tier. Annoying QTE's have been removed meaning that you can sit back and watch in between fights.  The direction is fantastic, and the cutscene animations, particularly facial animations are the best in the genre, and are better than many games with far greater budgets. Some sections of the story end a little abruptly but the vast majority of the campaign is well done.

Towers of time are fun since the patch (originally they were completely broken and the difficulty was way too high) and are a good way to practice with characters allowing you to gain bonus rewards. Comsumables can be used here in order to make challenging fights easier, and you don't have to be too conservative with them as consumable drops come often.

Klassic towers are back. Complete a tower with a character to unlock an ending for them. Same as in other mortal kombat games. 

You can create custom variations this year but they can't be used in ranked play. Can be very fun in towers of time and in kasual online gameplay though.

[b]And now onto the bad stuff...[/b]

There are too many currencies in this game.
- Koins: earned by completing fights, spent in the krypt
- Soul Fragments: earned by completing fights, spent in the krypt
- Hearts: earned by performing fatalities, brutalities and mercies, unlocks rarer chests in the krypt
- Easy fatality tokens: obtained in chests, allows fatalities to be performed with a simple input
- Skip fight tokens: obtained in chests, can skip difficult tower fights
- Time krystals (CAN BE PURCHASED FOR REAL MONEY): Spend on a daily rotation of skins, intros, calling cards etc... All of which can be obtained in the game for free. This currency can also be earned in game and if you only spend them on skins that you want for your main character you'll never need to buy them. 

Skins - There are too many skins in this game. In MKX every skin looked amazing, they were all cool. Now each character has ""60"" skins - but most of which are just colour palette swaps that destroy the image of iconic characters that have been in this franchise for over 25 years. Sub-zero doesn't have to be blue, hell you can dress him in red and call him Ermac and no one will know the difference. Quality here has been substituted for quantity.

Tournament variations should be the default variations. It makes no sense that they aren't and you have to set them all up for each individual character.",1558383193,1558383193,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False,76561198106943406,283,4,25817,142,7357,1601637156,,

11,50732790,english,"I'm going to preface this by saying I'm a big Mortal Kombat fan, always have been since UMK3. I'm very into the series but that only makes me want to look at this game thoroughly with a fine toothed comb and talk about it so people can make an informed decision about weather or not they want the game. That being said let's kontinue.

I have and will continue to enjoy this game. It feels very fresh when it came to the ways they shook up the fighting mechanics for a mortal kombat game, the presentation, gameplay and visuals are all spot on, and the redesigns are much more tasteful while feeling like they put more thought into the personalities of the characters and how that plays a role in their overall attire. The story, while I know not everyone would enjoy, feels like they decided to just make a fun sequel to MK9 and X that makes up for some of the shortcomings, and while it can be dumb at times, it was entertaining til the end. There's a wide cast of characters (many returning faces and some newcomers who sadly do not get a lot of screentime in the story) that are for the most part fun to play as well as having diverse skill sets while also being customizable to your liking.

Though with everything it does right, it also rubs a lot of people the wrong way. I understand the criticism people are having with the game, taking your hard fought currency to the krypt and getting absolute trash like icons and komsumables when you just want new costumes is pretty agitating, yet the game has a few ways you can work around, for example in the Towers of Time you can summon character specific towers and challenge them to earn gear for them and in the Krypt there is a shrine not too far in where if you pay 100k Koins you get a guaranteed skin you haven't unlocked yet. I myself enjoy the towers of time but think it is definitely not everyone's cup of tea. The challenges range from manage-able to very difficult or nearly impossible without items, yes you get plenty of items, but they also get tedious to manage and end up in lots of chests that you simply would've wanted better gear from.

I can say the game has enough content to warrant being paid for (full price or a sale), but that would vary depending on how much you enjoy the series. It feels like for everything it does bad, there is something good there that shines through. The krypt feels less rewarding than it should, but it is chock full of fan service and great atmosphere, and is in itself a sort of adventure. The story mode isn't very well written, but the animation is fluid and overall was entertaining in a silly B karate movie kind of way. There are microtransactions but every skin in the game (at the time of this writing) is obtainable through playing the game's various modes and gives you a bit more reason to continue playing the game to unlock more skins or gear. Hopefully the drop rate for skins is upped somehow in the future, or maybe currency besides koins becomes easier to obtain (the best way to get them now is to play the time towers.)

I have a few issues specifically with the port, the audio is super quiet unless I turn on loudness equalization on my sound settings, and I've seen a couple nasty slow downs with specific character moves with a lot of particles (maybe this part is just my computer?), but this game is constantly getting updated so hopefully a bug report will fix these issues.

I hope I've shed a little light on the situation for anyone on the fence, I will be recommending this game personally because I'm having a blast with it, and hope many others do as well.

Edit: Forgot to mention the tutorial is beautifully in depth, there are beginner and advanced tactic tutorials as well as character specific tutorials which are all great tools for learning the game.",1558335498,1558335812,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198049508990,627,12,3824,0,1472,1586665256,,

I think that the new fatal blow mechanic is really great as it separates what used to be x-rays from meter. The new meter system is also really good, allowing for a defense and attack meter. The story is... well it's definitely an MK story for sure, but it works fine for what it is. Overall I think that the gameplay is the most important aspect of a game like this, and the gameplay is spot on in my opinion, and I have not experienced any connection issues on the part of the game as of yet.

13,50522854,english,"[h1]Mortal Kombat 11 Doesn't Want You To Play[/h1]

[b]Introduction[/b]

I've been a fan of MK since I played MK2 on Amiga. The infamous diskette swap nightmare was my ""minigame"" and I enjoyed it a lot. MKX on PC was terrible as a port; the core game was good if you could play it.

Along comes MK11 with a much better port (at least for me) and I still can't recommend this game. The problem lies elsewhere.

[b]Story[/b]

I'll handle this first because it's the easiest one to cover. The ending WILL NOT please everyone but considering the 30 years of inconsistent information; it's expected. Storytelling and voice work is top notch. It's basically Injustice 2 in MK universe.

[b]Roster[/b]

A roster of 25 characters is probably the bare minimum for a fighting game nowadays but they handle it well. Every character offers something the others don't (some offer much more though) so it's not ""great"" but not a problem either.

[b]Multiplayer[/b]

I don't play multiplayer in fighting games so I'd suggest you to read other reviews for that.

[b]Towers & Krypt (Single Player Content without Story)[/b]

Now, this is the meat of the SP content. Krypt is incredibly large with its own puzzles and stuff but, Konsumables become a problem the way Netherrealm handles them. Let me explain.

Now there are tons (and I mean TONS) of items you can find in the Krypt. These are Augments (stat for gears), Gears (for customization), Skins (ditto), Tower Konsumables, Forge Konsumables, Kollector Trade Items, Krypt Key Items, Koins, Souls and Hearts. I may have missed one or two (or more) so bear with me.

With all of this stuff randomly* available in the Krypt and Towers of Time, after spending 5 minutes in the Krypt I became indifferent to any of them. I didn't care. I cared for the skins for a while but when a single character has 60+ skins and ~70 gear pieces, I gave up searching for them. Krypt is a sink of all things and time is the biggest of them.

* (Some chests are placed permanently so not everything is random but you get the idea.)

When there is so much to unlock, where do you start? Well, I jumped in the first tower and finished it. I get a skin for a character after finishing it (remember, not every tower gives you a skin) but I remembered that this was 1 of ~1500 skins I wanted to collect. My joy of ""collecting skins"" was broken instantly. So I decided to farm aaand that's most of my 30 hours of gameplay went.

You can ""program"" AI behaviour for battling and I don't know if this is a good thing or a bad thing. On the one hand, you don't play the game; AI battles with AI and you grind for stuff. On the other hand, some towers are stupidly hard and some modifiers constrict you so much, you actually don't want to play. Like Ice Storm; this modifier makes ice fall in the arena. The problems are...
1 - They are random.
2 - They hit for 50HP (you have 1000 max)
3 - If more than 2 of them hits you, you're frozen (just like Sub-Zero's freeze blast)
4 - This doesn't affect the enemy.

Another one was proximity based freeze that I don't remember the actual name, but I remember the explanation: ""It freezes the enemy [u]slowly[/u] when they are near."" In this explanation, the enemy is you and the ""slowly"" is roughly 2 seconds. I kid you not, the enemy AI cannot finish the throw animation because my character would just freeze in the middle of it.

And this is bad. From the ~40 tower konsumables to infinite amount of items Krypt can spew; from the AI fighters to punishing modifiers that downright block or interrupt your game flow; Mortal Kombat 11 does not want you to play it. It wants you to drain your time in it. It also doesn't want all of your money either since Time Krystals don't do much. It just doesn't want you to play.

[b]Conclusion[/b]

I know there is a good game in there. Somewhere. If it lets me play and enjoy the game I might find it but nowadays, I don't bother.

25,50297184,english,"Editing this review as a recent patch did help boost the rewards, but even with greatly enhanced income, the issues with this game's economy are more than glaring. 

Even when spending upwards of 12k on a random loot chest, you can be rewarded with a tiny variation icon for a character's portrait. Literally a 25x25 pixil thumbnail can cost the same as a fatality. The only issue is, there's only 20 fatalities to unlock. There's over 1000 variation icons though. 

Every time I think I'm done with this game's garbage, I'm presented with something new. I opened almost every treasure chest in the game to the point I'm struggling to find more, only to be told that if I want to get more loot (as opening every treasure chest in the game doesn't even get you 1 10th of what you actually need), you have to pay over 800 thousand koins to refill them all.

26,50311475,english,"This is a re-review. Because game had HUGE flaws at the release, mostly because unbalanced grinding system and poor game stability based on constant crashes and online desyncs. However, Netherrealm Studios and QLOC worked on patches - sadly, few days after Playstation patches - and problems are fixed. 

[b]Right before we dive all-in and discuss what Mortal Kombat 11 offers to it's playerbase, I can clearly say this is the best game in whole franchise, leave it's predecessors behind and draw a straight yet tick line between itself and them.[/b]

Mostly because of all-new and overhauled gameplay mechanics it has. Not because of graphics or soundtracks -which is yet again best in-terms of predecessors- or not the best but good customization. Game speed is not like any Mortal Kombat games before, it's something new, fresh. They tried to make a game that doesn't have a 50/50 meta, slow pacing fights are now truly based on outthinking your enemy. Don't get me wrong, I like other MK games, but this is truly shines above them. Some fighting games are memorable for being best in franchise, like Street Fighter III Third Strike or Tekken 5, both franchises pulled good games but the taste of their predecessors isn't forgetable. And this game feels like it's the game that will be remembered.

Game speed is toned down a lot which is an excellent job because matches feel more fair and tactical. All new things introduced made MK away from other fighting games. Like having 2 different meter for offense and defense, so you can do both without concern of losing your meter for another. Sprinting and stamina is both removed, which is good thing because sprinting was an essential in pulling long combos, rushdown oppressing your opponent after knockdown and moving towards fast to keep distance with your opponent. It was not reliable and not feel easy to use. Now for those three you have to get used to footsies, dashing and poking - which makes it more tactical. Grab meta that people talking about is real, but it's not bad in a slow paced game like this. And yes, it can be counterable if you don't mash your buttons, best example I can give rn is just keep your distance away with footsies, so you can outplay grab abusers.

[b]Just don't get desperate about losing, always remember, every lose you get is an experience on fighting games. Just don't make same mistakes over and over again, try to change your style like your combo starters, if you aggressively push your opponent and get punished, be more defensive - let enemy do the first mistake.[/b]

Graphics are best ones i've ever seen. Stunning visuals, provided with good lighting and particals. Models are picture realistic and they nailed it excellent. Expressions on characters faces are incredible for a fightning game. Some options QLOC offers are blessed me, like giving particle load an option to use whether GPU or CPU. I couldn't say this is the best port QLOC ever made, because they made more successful ports, but this is someway decent.

Like it, whether or not, storytelling gone much, much higher. You always get the feeling of being not in depth universe with the story in old games, mostly because of it doesn't feel nature. However, they reduced it a lot, stories are more believable. Sure I can say they can made a better story, but I can't skip the fact that they improved on terms of storytelling.

[b]Only bad mistake they did is make NPC characters yet again - Kronika is a boss and she shouldn't be a playable character, this is okay but Cyrax and Sektor is pure bullshit. Please Netherrealm, just stop making NPCs when you already modelled and scripted characters already.[/b]

Well, character roster is not bad - this is going to be a personal mumbling - but some characters that definitely missing after all those opinions of reasonable fan outrages. Mileena had a chance in previous 2 games while Jade was only had one, so letting her stay dead for a while is not bad. We can see both female ninjas can share movesets with Kitana well so keeping identical clone out for one game is not a bad choice, even tho i like Mileena more than Kitana, but Kitana is one of the originals so I am okay with that. But keeping Rain out with zero chance to return due Netherrealm never repetitive DLCs is pissing me, mostly because of he was a NPC in Mortal Kombat X. Reptile, Ermac, Smoke and Triborg is a huge gap for me, because they was like a good flavor with crazy differences among other characters.

[b]Yes I say Triborg, because it should be a perfect character for game with an ability customization system like this. Having Triborg could mostly make fans of Cyrax, Sektor and Smoke happy with just a price of one would be smart move, but it's already late because it was a DLC in Mortal Kombat X, and like i've said, no repetitive DLCs is a rule.[/b]

The accessibility options of game is impressed me. Few examples I can give; game lets you decide to keep Negative Edge on or off - a setting that makes your inputs work when releasing a key that you already hold, More diagnostic movement inputs for strings - allows you to use analogs or a fighting stick easier, input delay to simulate online play, input time for special moves, a setting for new mechanic called krushing blows - they work automatically when conditions met but when you use that setting you do them manually by holding last button that could trigger it, a setting to make strings that use 2 attack buttons same time could be triggered with grab button, ping and w/l record trackers, lowered health bars for people who have hard time to look their health with a wide display and detailed health/stamina tracker.

The content is huge, there is klassic towers that we all know from previous games. There is Towers of Time game mode that makes random towers with random modifiers to keep you challenge - also you can go up through weekly leaderboards for rewards. Gauntlet tower with real deal challenges - we all know it's the challenge tower from previous games. The Krypt is something between Konquest - Krypt - 2000s Adventure Games and I honestly liked it. There is AI battles, along with AI customization that you can use almost anywhere you want. There is private matchmaking and room creations for gaming sessions with your friends. There is also Ranked matches that locks all gameplay-wise customizations and make you play 3 sets of matches because first matchups can be pretty random, so playing again with same person will give you chance to outsmart him. There will be also a league-based system but it's delayed.

[b]Also there is Tag and Group battles against AI in Towers of Time, but it's not always available, mostly because game doesn't coded and based on tag system. Don't be mad, because they never promised it will be tag based game - it's an addition, a welcomed one.[/b]

Also netcoding is decentish. There is no constant delays, just spikes and I can safe to say it's good on PC, whether you think it's not due the old games were not good. They are working with QLOC, a good port company, and they are trying to improvise with every patch.

And finally, there is literally few items you can pick with microtransactions, literally 5 items that came out random every day. A character have like 60 skins and if you want to get them all you had to be EXTREME lucky and check game 12 constant days. If you need something, you have to grind.

29,50308575,english,"Very disappointing. I've got quite a few problems with how Netherrealm does things, including their efforts to push their politics and show everyone how progressive they are, but I'm willing to ignore those gripes for now and focus only on the gameplay itself.

Everyone has already gone in depth with how terrible the F2P-style progression system is in the Krypt, so you probably already know all about that. See a cool skin you want? Too bad, go play some slot machines and cross your fingers. 

The towers of time feel really bad to play, and this is after the huge balancing update that Netherealm rushed out after the flood of complaints from players. I never even played the original towers, so I can't imagine how bad those were if the current ones are still this anti-fun. I dare you to try to have fun against an enemy with unlimited hyper-armor at all types. It can't be done. I shouldn't have to rely on random drops of consumables in order to have a chance.

The story is so-so, typical Netherrealm story-mode. I wouldn't recommend buying JUST for the story, it's not quite engaging enough for that unless you are a huge MK lore fan.

The online netcode is generally pretty good, although there are always some folks out there that should not be playing this game on wi-fi. 

As for my more serious complaints, most lie with the balancing. Some characters have great and safe mids that can be abused (Erron, Geras and Scorpion) with others seriously lacking in that department. Certain matchups are absolutely terrible because of these differences, and you'll feel it if you're on the losing end.
Crushing blows would be a cool concept if they were even close to balanced. Shao Kahn and Johnny Cage, two characters I was unfortunate enough to choose to play, have essentially no crushing blows that can be reasonably hit during a match, which seriously hurts their strength against characters with crushing blows that will inevitably land during a match just by playing (I'm looking at Geras and Scorpion in particular). I'm sure some balancing patches will be coming soon, and I hope Netherrealm doesn't hold back. 

The custom variations were also a cool idea, which Netherrealm quickly ruined by restricting their use to casual matches only. Keep in mind, these variations were the main marketing draw of the game since the original reveal, only for them to be essentially invalidated three weeks before launch. I've heard all the arguments against their inclusion, and I haven't heard a good one yet. Some of the top players like Sonicfox and Dragon agree, and have been pushing Netherrealm to make the change.

Overall a disappointing game, and lacking in quality to the point that you should not give Netherrealm any of your money unless some serious changes are made. Go get a fun game like Soul Calibur.",1556148870,1558234024,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198044600088,285,8,1640,0,1640,1558231947,,

I, like everyone, sat down and read every written and recorded review there is and still being published before buying this for PC. I was freaked the F out when hearing that this game is a bad port and that MKX had similar issues and such but let me carefully remind everyone that NetherRealms released Injustice 2 before MK11 and these two games are BASICALLY the same damn game....

Both games have their weird fps locks, which I personally believe is the cause to all technical problems because PC's will obviously run these games better but the game optimisation itself is like ""na na mate, ya can't do that here cus the plebs over with them consoles will cry n such"", but beyond that these games work... Period.

I've played this game for a while now, story, krpyt, online etc and the only only only only thing that really pisses me off about this game isn't the way it runs.... no... moreso the fact that 99% of the contents in this game are F'ING LOCKED BEHIND BS.

WHY COULDN*T THEY DO IT LIKE TEKKEN DOES IT? GIVE US MONEY. OPEN UP A WEIRD ASS LOOKING ATTIRE SHOP WITH A WEIRD ZOMBIE BEHIND THE REGISTER... OR LORD RAIDEN FOR THE F'ING LOLZ.... because... can you imagine?

""Lord Raiden... does this leather vest look good on my shaolin top?""
""Yes, Liu Kang, it somehow does but I must consult with the Elder Gods to be sure.""
""Of course, Lord Raiden.""
*Weird finger twisty thingy that somehow means honour and family.* (I dunno, Scorpion did it. People will believe anything these days.)

NOW... All this said and done.
It's a fighting game. You can fight. Kill. Fight Kill. Kill Fight. 

This is a pretty damn good game man. I like it. You'll like it.

Actual fighting is well done 
Story is also well done
Decent roster
Great sound 
Impressive graphics and violent details.
Krypt is very well designed. 

Cons:
Females were apparently changed as to not show so much skin on the basis of you wouldn't wear a bikini to fight, this logic wasn't applied to the male counterparts. Leaving all the females characters looking like they are just 1 article of clothing away from looking like they would belong to some extremist religious calaphate?! 

Grinding..If you want extra outfits or gear , at its current iteration , you will be grinding a very long time. In fact; this game is a frustrating grind wall that leads you to a pay wall that doesn't even exist (which, to their credit,  is a good thing) .  Only problem it leaves with one feeling ; ""absolute frustration"" of unlocking new customization options for your fighters.  Never before has a MK game been so grindy just for a alternate outfit or for customization options. 


U.I:  The u.i reminds you of a mobile game.  

Krypt: Neatherealm said : ""there are no lootboxe(s) in MK11"" well; that's true, there are no lootboxe(s), only because the ENTIRE Krypt is one giant lootbox!  Almost everything is randomized. goood luck unlocking all you paid for without the endless grinding.

Always online: Aggressive anti-piracy always online measures that only punish paying customers. No unlocks, coins, or currency is saved without online connection. Krypt (the lootbox arena) cant even be loaded. 

Summary: As a whole package , you have a MK game that is superior to its predecessor in terms of fighting mechanics and story alone, everything else is literally a social justice political agenda infused grind wall that leads you to a pay wall (yet the paywall doesn't really exist) which all combined , leaves you with a grindy ,frustrating expierence with anything outside the core of the game.  

 Always Online Anti-Piracy That Punishes The Paying Customer, Crashing,  GRIND WALLS , SELFISH POLITICAL AGENDAS THAT SIMPLY DO NOT BELONG  really stop this game from being what it could've been, The Best Mortal Kombat in a very, very long time. 

If nothing changes; wait for a ""XL"" edition or similar with all content unlocked. Don't waste your time or money right now. hell ; most of us still wont have all the stuff unlocked by then anyway.



5/17/19 Updates:  The grind has been reduced in recent patches! It could still use further reductions however the patch does make it at least in the realm of tolerable if just barely. Towers of Time have also been nerfed a bit make them a much more , well, a winnable fight.  Netherealm is also looking addressing the some 30fps caps, yes, thats right actually listening to fans in this regard. Thats a big plus! Now if we just get some proper skins for some of the fighters , Sub-Zero for example and especially some of the females whom have been unjustly and unfairly changed for purely some art directors political belief which you may or may not share.   


Netheralm is heading in the right direction. Based on what we have here and the direction it seems to be going Im changing this review to a positive one. As the core is superb, the story is great, the violence is over the top as it should be, its just minor things that continue to hold this game back; Always online requirement , 30 fps caps in some scenarios (being looked into) , grind walls (reduced - could use more but much better)  and wardrobe political agendas.

KRINGE review for the meme game.

Edit: So this is the second edit, because somehow steam decided to not save the first one, so i will make it short, the online gameplay is GARBAGE. I expected a little development after the failure of mortal kombat x, but even playing with friends can be frustrating when you get constant game desync, so you have to make the session again, and the online input lagg makes your otherwise nice combo not working at all. I input my fucking combo, and it simply stands still after the start. 
FIX YOUR GAME NETHERREALM.
Edit: After further testing I can say the combo part was partly my fault, because there is a default option of Release Check, wich makes your combo mess up.

63,50675789,english,"I'm going to post this review as positive because I actually really like the game.  This does come with a really huge ""BUT"" with the Krypt.  Now, I like the grind personally, the krypt is cool (minus a few personal things) and to me, it's not the largest of deals since they combated the horrid grind the game had.  The fighting mechanics and general way the game is played feels good, and it feels satisfying to land blows and such.  The only thing holding it back from being one of the top fighting games of recent years, like DBFZ and Guilty Gear, is the progression of unlocking things.  I think if they took inspiration from DBFZ for the unlocking things for the krypt it would be a lot better.

I will say as well personally, the game gets a few points from me reducted because of the stupid jumpscares.  They are unessisary, don't do anything, and just... shouldn't be in the game.  The best example I can give to them for being bad is FNAF (as weird as that is).  At least in that game it was a punishment, in the Krypt, it's more of ""Oh I'm gonna check to see what's h- and I'm dead.""  This is a minor portion but i'm someone who hates jumpscares and thinks of them as the absolute worst form of horror.  The krypt is completely fine on it's own for creep factor, but no.  We have to have jump scares because the other games had them.  Problem is, the jump scares in this game take control away and berrate you for... doing things you HAVE to do.  It's a minor thing but it's annoying they decided that it was a good idea to do it.  That being said this is more of a rant on why it's bad, and it's more a minor thing for the krypt that shouldn't be in it and doesn't completely detract from the game itself.

82,50656812,english,"The game in one word: [b]FUN[/b]. This is a great fighting game. In it's core, it is a better experience than other Mortal Kombat games. The gameplay is tight, deeper, with some new estrategic elements. The visuals are superb, with great art direction and details. The sound design is great and the music is much better than the latest entries.

There are lots of modes and content. The story mode, for instance, is very entertaining. The Krypt contains lots of easter eggs and fan service. By playing each mode for the first time (from tutorials to online matches), you unlock new stuff. If you play the tutorial for a character, you get a new skin; if you play the Towers for the first time, you get a lot of currencies; each Tower can give you gears, skins and konsumables to even hard matches; if you check the daily challenges, you get more koins, so far and so forth.

Should you buy it at the current price? If you're a fan o the franchise, [u]YES[/u]! If you you're a fan of fighting games, [u]YES[/u]! Specially considering there won't be another major fighting game in the horizon. And, well, the thing about fighting games is that there is a diference in post launch online gameplay. It's premium price to play the game with lots of other players right in the beginning, so you can pratice more.

Is the game perfect? [u]NO[/u]! So how about all this negative reviews? Well, I would say to each his/her own. I'll cover the bad aspects of the game, but I believe there is an overreaction in general.

The biggest problem to me is the always online requirement. For single player content (like the Krypt), that shouldn't be necessary. You can play some stuff if you're offline, but not everything. I don't have server problems and I'm always online anyway, but this is bad game design. Maybe I myself don't have problem with that now, but it's clearly affecting some players and this has the potencial to cripple the game in the future.

There is a lot of content, yes, but the average player won't be able to see everything. The grind is real *¬π. I'd say that part of the game was overdesigned. But if your goal is to play game first and unlock after, the grinding becomes managable. Each character has about 60 skins, that being 6 or 7 unique skins with different colors. Do you really need all the colors? The gears can give you a unique look, though (maskless Kitana... <3). I recommend to visit the Krypt after saving a lot of coins, so you can explore it without much trouble.

About microtransactions... Who is stupid enough to spend real money in this game? The store just gives you limited options in a limited time space and you can get the Time Crystals (ingame currency for MTX) by just playing the game. You can get more stuff by playing the game in just 1 hour. This is something the developers could remove entirely and the game would keep the same. My impression is that WB asked for it and Netherrealm Studios included, but in the corner. It just gave bad press.

The problem with the 30fps cap in Fatalities, Fatal Blows, menu isn't really a problem (I'm a guy who played 4 players split screen Goldeneye 007 for Nintendo 64, maybe at 10fps...). This is the same thing from Mortal Kombat X and it doesn't affect the fighting itself. I get you expect options in PC, but it is not a reason for a negative review. If you really have an issue with that, rejoice because the game is not in Epic Store and there is a mod to fix this while the developers don't patch it *¬≤.

There are some bugs here and there, but the game is just 3 weeks in the market. There have been patches every week. About the female characters' clothes and some endings... This is subjective, but I just roll the eyes when I read stuff like this *¬≥.

The game might not be perfect, but it's a lot of fun to play. You can wait for a ""XL"" version or something, but this time I didn't want to play the waiting game. I'm a fan of the franchise (Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 being my favorite MK for a long time) and this was the first game I ever preordered. And it was worth it. :-)

[b]In conclusion, the TLDR version: this is a must buy game, full price.[/b]

Notes:
*¬π The grind has been nerfed a lot. There was a point where I needed to do 75 Brutalities with a character to unlock a Tower. Now that level is unlocked with 10 Brutalities or Fatalities. Also, if you're really into grinding, there a lot of guides how to farm currencies. You can make some insanes stuff. For instance, check Google for turbo button on Steam (to make you grind an infinity tower).

*¬≤ There is a mod to unlock the framerate in Fatalities and the Krypt. I don't know about being banned using this, so use it at your own risk. Check it out: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXo51gTGKDs

Make no mistake about it, the unlock system in this game is criminally slow. I have 16 hours of play time so far and not unlocked a single random item for my favorite chosen character. I have opened chests on chests on chests and I would gather I've unlocked maybe 1% of the content so far, if that.

But the fighting game itself is completely rock solid. The combo system is easy to learn and the fatal blow mechanic (super move enabled at low health) really mixes things up and makes the game more interesting, as it can punish blitz tactics and allow for more strategy in battle. The characters are all unique and have plenty of customization options, and the overall feel of the game is simply top notch all around.

The removal of running in MK11 and the addition of Fatal/Krushing Blows is the most refreshing and best addition to the gameplay in my personal opinion.

The whole grind comes from the Towers of Time ... because the klassic towers are nearly too easy and too quickly done.

98,50474895,english,"Like any Mortal Kombat fan, I was anticipated to play the new series of this game, and with all the new fantastic features, still there are few letdowns that it might get fixed in the future, moreover my mentioning is just based on my early experience with this game that perhaps by time things could change to the better.

First of all, as a Steam user who never had the chance to experience the Beta Game, I wish it did come out on the PC and not only the PS4 and the Xbox consoles, at least the Steam users only could have the chance to learn more about the game than watching how things are on You Tube, because when getting the game as a whole and with the multi features in it, things could get confusing a little bit, may I add that I purchased the Ultimate addition of the game when it was first announced.

The Tutorials, perhaps the basic ones are the simplest one, but Advanced and Strategy things are getting extremely difficult especially with the flawless blocking and combos, I am not sure if I am going to be able to achieve it.
Fatality inputs is another issue, when I was doing the input for Johnny Cage‚Äôs puppet fatality, it doesn‚Äôt work most of the time rather than giving the opponent a hit, I have also faced that problem with few fighters as well like Sub-Zero, speaking of him, I also had issues performing his stage fatality in MKX, it never worked. 

The Krypt, although it is quite interesting but creepy and demanding at the same time, like why are there traps and dying whether in Goro‚Äôs lair or being burned by the spiders in the Kytin hive? In MKX I came to the point where I paid money to have it all unlocked because of the spiders that were jumping at me, true no death happens but I got jumping from my place more than once, hopefully we get the curtesey in this one or even being removed. Another thing that I didn‚Äôt like in it are burning skulls location to unlock the burning boxes, they are too difficult to get discovered and not all the boxes are opened with coins but with souls and hearts that we don‚Äôt get enough throughout playing the game. Regarding to the boxes or the number of items that needs to be unlocked, I don‚Äôt know how much exactly they are or even how do we know how much we unlocked?

However, my plan for Krypt is to leave it for a month and focus on the towers and do all the endings for each character, maybe by then I could have collected enough currency to unlock the items in the Krypt.

Another thing is the heads in the shrine, I understood that I need to perform 50 fatalities on every character in the Klassic Towers only, this is TOO demanding!
The Characters customization in terms of skins and naming our own variation, although I like having different kind of skins, but this is becoming too much of a Tea Party! Seriously, I liked it more in MKX, 3 different variations, few number of costumes and that‚Äôs it, but here 60 or over skin for every character and gears, some of them either found in the Krypt or the Towers of Time. The skins however they are all mostly different color variation. Perhaps if necessary, grouping the colors of the same costume and then selecting the color of my choice would be better. It‚Äôs becoming more like a ‚ÄúGoo Goo Ga Ga!!‚Äù

I also need to add, in the game it is alright to use inappropriate language but I am not allowed to use it for naming a character variation, how fair is this? Luckily I know Arabic and I used an inappropriate Arabic phrase in English letters for one of the female characters. Quite hypocrisy.

However, the good parts that I find it nice in the game:
I am able to achieve over 50% of the Personal Achievement Trophies which is great for me.
Having some of the Classic finishers as Brutalities for some of the characters, which I find it a nice throwback to the game.
I did love the design and the personality of Kitana in this series much more than in MKX, she was a pain in the neck on the previous game.

At this moment these are my thoughts on the game, sadly it‚Äôs all on the negative side at this moment, but hopefully things might flourish in the future. Again, this is my first thoughts after 2 weeks of playing the game.

-Animations are clean and realistic 

-Much personality put into each character

-Online is hell if you're new

-The krypt is not the best system 

The story also had some issues, I had problems with rendering certain objects which made them look white, the audio was de-synced, I tried pausing the game every time it happened, it fixed it but it would de-sync again in a matter of seconds which took away the immersion.

28,50617378,english,"The amount of content locked behind unfun mechanics makes this game feel lacking. I wouldn't recommend this game for full price. Wait until a sale that puts it to $40 at the most. 

The gameplay is fine. It's honestly the best feeling MK to date. Combat mechanics make sense, and feel well thought out. Graphics are great. It's very colorful, and the faces are impressive to say the least. The story mode is alright. It's a good conclusion to the series, but outside of one moment, it's nothing ground breaking or worth replaying. There's also a massive amount of unlockable cosmetic items (none requiring additional purchase). 

Where the game loses my recommendation is the focus on gimmicks and grinding to unlock the full experience of the game. The Krypt mode is how you unlock a majority of it, but it takes a lot of ingame currency to complete it. Personally, I don't mind grinding when the gameplay is fun. However, the best two ways to grind out this currency and unlocks are to set an AI fighter to win fights for you (it's as embarrassing as it sounds), and the Towers of Time mode.

The Towers of Time mode drives me insane. It's a cool concept. They're live, frequently updated series of fights that you completely for currency and cosmetics. It's a great idea for people who'd rather not play against other players. The issue is that these fights often give the opponent increased health for seemingly no reason (not boss characters or anything), and there is often some extra hazard you have to deal with. You can combat these handicaps with your own one-time buffs and items, but it really takes away from the gameplay since it feels less like you're playing the polished game, and more that you're out-cheesing the computer player.

These issues really get to me, because you can definitely tell that the combat team and the art team put a lot of effort into the game, but it feels like their work is being snuffed. You need to grind the towers to unlock the cosmetics, and you need to cheat the combat to complete those towers.

I should start off by mentioning that I'm a long time MK fan, dating all the way back to the original game on my neighbor's SNES. I should also mention that I am by no means a great player, so my voice speaks for the mediocre. With that said, MK 11 is a game with huge potential, that does a couple of things too wrong to deserve a recommendation from me.

Now, I was never a fan of X-ray moves from the previous games; ""moves"" that take little skill to correctly time and pull off, resulting in a cutscene that looks neat the first time you see it but quickly becomes a repetitive disruption to the flow of the game. The good thing about them, however, was that they required you to build and save up meter, making them a reasonably rare sight if players knew how to expend meter elsewhere. Now with MK 11 they've taken X-ray moves, renamed them Fatal Blows, and changed the trigger requirement from meter to low health, meaning at least one player will be attempting to pull one off every single game. They're blockable, sure, but a decent player will just activate them mid-juggle and there you go, 10 seconds of watching the same cutscene for the 542nd time. The fights in MK 11 are so smooth and satisfying, up until the point where one of these things are activated, and you just put down your controller, roll your eyes, sigh, and wait for the cinematic to end. In a game that's so momentum driven, these moves are so disruptive and boring that they alone inspired me to bother writing a review. Furthermore, the traditional Fatalities are an extension to this problem, with more obnoxious cutscenes added to each match to make sure you waste even more time before getting back into an actual game. The fact that you're also forced to grind Fatal Blows, Fatalities, etc. to unlock various things in the Krypt certainly doesn't make things better.

the good:
-the krypt is a cool concept and it's a lot of fun to just run around and solve puzzles, even if they're usually pretty simple. it's loaded with a lot of neat little things (like being able to find Reptile, and the whole thing is just fun to explore.
-the towers of time are also a cool concept, even though they're kind of a pain in the ass. they're a good way to get money and cosmetics and stuff
-the character designs are some of the best they've ever been, and everyone looks and sounds great for the most part
-everyone PLAYS really well too. there really isn't a bad character in this game.
-the combat is so much fun and is really good even for people who don't play fighting games. 
-along with that, the tutorial they provide is fantastic, and goes in-depth about things like frame data and other fighting game terms casual players may not know anything about
-the online play has been really solid so far, i haven't had really any problems with it
-kabal is here and i love him a lot

and now for the unfortunate downsides:
-the pc port is really not up to the console versions. its pretty poorly optimized and (though this may have changed), the pc version is (was?) a few updates behind the console versions
-the krypt, while cool, runs like ass in some parts due to, again, just being really poorly optimized
-rng is pretty annoying for trying to get cosmetics (krypt, towers, the time-limited shop, etc) but the defaults all look so good that cosmetics are really an afterthought (which is why i don't care about microtransactions because the only microtransactions are for cosmetics which, again, do not matter. don't like them, don't buy them stupid)
-the 60 to 30fps drop when doing fatalities is kind of annoying but it's something i've been able to look past
-ronda rousey's voice acting is SO bad, especially when put up next to other characters
-there's some really bad voice desync in the story mode and that's really the biggest problem i have had yet. 


this game is a lot of fun and, while i have enjoyed it immensely, it is definitely laden with problems that will definitely break the deal for a lot of people. if you are one of those people, then i definitely say wait it out until it gets patched, or if you're really interested in playing, get it on sale. my final thoughts are: game's fun, play it

72,50581806,english,"Mortal Kombat 11 is a great game. The issue is the PC version. I purchased MKX when it came out. Eventually the publisher decided to stop supporting the game in the middle of the games life. When MKX decided to update to MKXL, the PC version was left behind only to be resurrected a year later. 

I decided to give the PC version a go anyway. Hoping that the PC version will be supported properly. 

I was wrong. 

Right out of the gate the PC version was behind on Patches. These patches were essential game fixing patches based on negative feedback. 

I decided to give the lag in patches a day or two from launch day to see if things would get better. They didn't.

I ended up refunding my purchase from Steam (Thank you Steam) and purchasing the PS4 version which is patched first and seems to be the focus of support from Netherrealm. 

As I stated, the game itself is great. I have been a MK fan since day 1. This is the best game in the series so far in my opinion. The developers are working with us the user on gameplay issue and patching them as they see fit.

The story was pretty good (probably better than MKX) and I really like their idea to choose 1 kombatant between 2  of them (like in Injustice 2), but Kronika (the final boss) was really awful (even Corrupted  Shinnok was better than her).

The online fights  have remained the same as in MKX. You need a good connection to play online.

The gameplay is really different than I thought. The developers have been replaced the ""X- Ray"" with ""Fatal Blow"" (you can use this ability, only if you are under 30% hp) ,all fatalities are much easier to do, they changed the system for amplified moves. In this game you can't do big combos just like in MKX, but exists ""Krushing Blow"".

The graphics are really amazing. Every facial feature, every step , each accent were perfect. The Kombatants are pretty ""nice"" (D'Vorah is horrible, it gives me nightmares when I look at her).

I really like the ""Kustomization"" system.  You can create your own variation for kombatants (like abilities, gears, intros and more!).

The gameplay, when it works, it totally fine. Of course it also has amazing visuals and great music. The real problem is the buggy and half-hearted mess that is the PC version ultimately turned out to be. Frame rate drops, occasional audio issues, and even crashing to desktop. For me the issue got so bad that I actually tried to refund the game since it decided it didn't want to work after the first four hours of playtime. Sadly, thanks to Steams BS return policies, I'm now stuck with a $100 dollar game that I have to constantly try and tweak if I want it to run half as well as the console version. Assuming it wants to start up without uninstalling/reinstalling again.

That's not even considering the fact the PC port feels like an afterthought in comparison to it's console counterparts, especially where developer support is concerned. Or the fact that the krypt is a ridiculous grindfest. Or the in game store employing the same scummy tactics you'd expect from a mobile cash grab game. Or even the crazy difficulty spikes in towers of time.

I managed to get through the story, at least. While it was good for the most part, the ending was kinda crap. But that's a minor nitpick compared to everything else. So yeah, I'd avoid this until the ""Komplete Edition"" with a massive discount comes along.

86,50399694,english,"This is my third time editing this review.
The PC port still has problems but the devs are patching pretty much every week.
1. At the moment the main problems are a desync when you are playing online or co-op towers.
2. The game just closes itself randomly.
3. We are still like a week behind with patches from the PS4 version.
4. The grind is still there but at least its not as punishing as before. You still need to do 50 fatalities on every character to get the heads and so on.
5. Character towers are a pain but a patch is coming to PC to reduce the grind that you are required to do.

Overall the game is going in the right way but everyone is thinking - Why couldn't they fix those stuff from the start? Well PC ports have been like this for decades but NRS is taking it a step notch and just playing with the PC players.

Can I recommend this game?...Actually yes, if they manage to fix the problems with the online as soon as possible and stop leaving us in the dirt with those patches, yes.
1. The story is well made and the graphics are gorgeous.
2. The Krypt is fun to explore and solve puzzles, making you to grind the currencies in order to go further into the krypt is not that punishing and is actually fun(if you are lazy, you can put an AI to fight for you and grind those currencies).
3. Towers of Time are fun and possible now. I do them without any konsumables and there isnt a problem with them(except some nasty freeze mechanics and such).
4. The tutorial is the best thing about this game and the best tutorial in all fighting games in my opinion.
5. Characters feel different from each other and are way easier to learn than previous MK titles.

Final thoughts: If you can wait for everything to be fixed, just wait. Its annoying to play online matches and randomly the game throws you out or just desyncs. If you don't get annoyed pretty easily, just pick up the game now and explore all of the other stuff that are there in the game.

Beware, might be hit or miss with technical issues.
Online play is currently hindered by desyncing. Will be patched soon, hopefully.

Do not believe people complaining about microtransactions.
 
The game does not encourage you buy any premium currency. There is a premium shop that has random cosmetic items on 24h rotation. So far (80h played) the game gave me the equivalent of $40 in Time Crystals just for playing and I have not spent any because it's pointless. Unless you get lucky and the shop has some specific cosmetic item you want, there is no point in using the Time Crystals. And when the time comes and the shop has something you like, you will be swimming in the stuff and can get it for free. The only valid argument is that there is no way to spend extra money to circumvent unlocking stuff.

There is a huge amount of cosmetic items and an element of randomness in obtaining them but there is no way to buy your way out of it.

Gameplay is great. I really can't complain about anything in that area. I am not sure about the Fatal Blow mechanic but at least it offers some tactical options. Splitting the super meter into two parts, offensive/defensive, is a really nice now that Fatal Blows are not tied to super meter and is much better than the older variations.

MK11is a deep mechanical fighting game, with so much to do and learn. It also doesn't hurt that the game is GORGEOUS. Without a doubt, the most graphically well-done fighting game ever released. With the addition of the Towers of Time (post-balance patch ToT, that is) this game keeps me coming back daily to do new towers and earn new gear. It uses the same premise as the Multiverse from Injustice 2, if you're familiar with that. 

Although I think the story of Mortal Kombat could probably benefit from going back to the idea of actual tournaments, it's a good addition to the tale that NRS has been building upon since the reboot. If you enjoyed MKX's story, this is even better in my opinion.

This is a good game. Actually, it's a great game. People saying that it's based around microtransactions are actually so wrong that it hurts. The only purchasable currency in the game are Time Krystals. The only things you can buy with Time Krystals are 5 random skins each day and easy fatalities. The purchasable skins are typically low-mid tier skins that you may as well play to earn anyway. Spending any amount of time in the game would prove that, but look at the time played of most people leaving negative reviews... The ones that DO have a decent amount of time and left a negative review are discussing issues that have been PATCHED. ToT is no longer ridiculously difficult, and the PC version has been brought in line with the other console versions as far as movesets and values are concerned.

If you like fighting games, do yourself a favor and pick up this game. It's a treat.",1557296077,1557356789,True,5,1,0.483066022396087646,0,True,False,False,76561198103177918,194,9,5568,0,2429,1559876442,,
23,50548882,english,"I'm recommending this game because basically I did get all that I hoped for, for the most part. The way I see it, the game has many issues but most of them are beyond the scope of the core game. I'll try to be brief as I believe everything has already been said and I doubt this will be read by many (if any) people.

[b]Type of player/ main activities and gameplay style:[/b]
My main focus is playing locally (in the same room with two gamepads) with friends, the story mode, online play and the Krypt. Save for the story, I do all these things with a group of friends. We gather once a week to play games, so when it comes to MK we first play some rounds between ourselves and then look for opponents online and take turns playing. When done we explore the Krypt.

[b]The Good:[/b]
[list]
    [*]Gameplay - Fightwise: A bit simplified according  to some, in therms of available combo strings. Personally I don' mind this. Playing MKX online against super skilled players meant you wouldn't be touching the ground and probably wouldn't even do much with you gamepad if you're an average player. Here you constantly need to be on your toes no matter how skilled you are because 30%+ kombos are rare, from what I've seen so far.
    [*]Gameplay - Krypt (more on this in ""The Bad"") Amazingly detailed version of Shang Tsungs island, an opportunity to explore some iconic places and learn some lore, an upgrade of the previous versions with a 3rd person view and a mysterious protagonist. Seeing The Pit, Goro's Lair etc. from all sides is definitely a big deal for me :) 
    [*]Graphics - though locked at 60fps I don't mind, never saw much of a difference with 60fps and >60fps
    [*]Story - Cinematic level experience, ridiculous ending (imo) but still a great experience overall. Facial animations are among some of the best I've seen, and characters have depth, some more than others. And yes, Raiden does consult the Elder Gods at minimum 1 point in the story.
    [*]Kustomization - Lot of options (this will have a downside listed in ""The Bad"" )
    [*]Creativity - Lots of imaginative fatalities, characters, art, etc
[/list]

[b]The Bad:[/b]
[list]
    [*]Kustomization - Lot of recolors & color coded rarity (gray, green, blue, purple etc) which imho doesn't belong in MK, keep that stuff in MMORPGs
    [*]Towers of Time (ToT) - initially a grindfest with ridiculous difficulty, greatly addressed with the patch, gatelocks many pieces of gear & skins, but is OK since the patch, though still a game model I dislike seeing, especially in games where it really seems out of place, such as this one.
    [*] AI battles & AI fighting for you in ToT - honestly, this shouldn't be a thing...gamers should do the gaming, not the game. Ironically you will find yourself letting Noob on AI finish that one guy in the tower you can't beat. You'll feel bad, yes.
    [*]Gameplay - Krypt & Kurrencies; To many kurrencies, 3 of them used in the krypt, dependent heavily on the ToT, meaning grind is key. 
    [*]Extra kurrency for microtransactions - Completely unnecessary, standard premium currency type deal, by X for N$ etc, used to buy several items which are on sale for this specific currency at any time...personally have no intention of using this, I don't thing it's as bad as it is worthless, however it is not pay to win as you can't buy anything you want just a couple select items, all Kosmetic as well, so like I said, basically just meaningless.
[/list]

[b]The Neutral[/b]
Gameplay - Fatal Blows: don't think this is a popular opinion but here it goes - Fatal Blow = MKX: X-Ray with one important difference being that there is no energy bar for it. It is available once per match whenever your health drops below 30%. Personally I dislike this a lot because this basically takes it from an optional move it was in MKX & 9 to a tool available no matter your playstyle. This gets dull pretty fast, at least for me. In MKX & 9 you had a fair choice - enhance you moves or save up for the X-Ray, and most people preferred to enhance their moves because it is better overall and, lets face it, more fun. Here you are always on the lookout for that one hit which if connects takes away 30%+ of your health. This does add some suspense as you can never be certain of victory. If it's the final round and you wasted your Fatal Blow but the opponent has it, dropping them below 30% HP puts you both at great risk because the opponent now has the opportunity to equalize the situation. It is an interesting concept, and has saved me in ToT multiple times, but I am not entirely sure I would consider it an enhancement as it basically means seeing two Fatal Blow animations in each online match and you're just sitting there proud that you mashed two buttons together or cursing at your opponent for hitting you with it for 314 dmg when you were at 310 :) Like I said, it's an interesting feature to be certain but in my opinion a bit flawed. It would be improved if missing a FB meant it is spent, not just on a CD like it is now.

[b]Explaining the verdict[/b]
All in all you can get cool gear from the krpyt with coins from the story mode, and with what you earn playing with friends and the occasional ToT, so if you aren't that interested in gear you'll be free from the grind. But seeing as my main focus is for my friends and I to have the opportunity to pit our favorite characters against each other, challenge players online and maybe even tackle the story together (not tag team like, that doesn't exist sadly) this game delivers on these fronts. While it is sad to see that the cancer of the industry has spread, in the end NRS gave us a game that is creative, fun, and a real MK game...it just came with some extra garbage. 
If you can resist the urge to shop for RL money (which shouldn't be hard here) and aren't the type of person who needs every piece of gear, you'll be fine.
This game should not get a bad rep because in essence it is a great MK game with, like I said, some new systems which don't really fit but can be avoided.

So in the end, I recommend this game, when the grind gets to much remember you can play online and go Test Your Might with others who don't like farming :)",1557354526,1557354560,True,1,1,0.514925360679626465,0,True,False,False,76561198370107801,108,2,35443,305,4417,1601684326,,

On the flip side, Both Kahn‚Äôs are a poor choice against anyone who understands how they play.) But this is in about any game.

Variety of characters online keeps you on your toes and keeps things fresh & fun. Towers are fun, but depending on the modifier things can get pretty cheesy, especially because sometimes they only are against you. 

People make The Krypt ‚Äúgrind‚Äù far worse than it actually is. If you play the game regularly, even for just an hour or so, you can amass quite a lot of Koins, Green (souls?), and Hearts. Even Time Krystals come fairly easily. This is on top of the MANY exploits and tricks to getting things faster. Yes it is pretty unlikely you will get every piece of gear and skin for every character, but for example, I have nearly everything for Baraka, focusing mostly on him when it comes to towers, online, AI battle, etc. Krypt items will come eventually, sometimes slower, sometimes faster. I‚Äôve gotten fairly lucky finding Baraka loot from the randomized crates. (As well as looking up guides for crates that have set items, such as Heart boxes or the 25k crates in Shang Tsungs Throne Room.)

46,50529300,english,"I always wanted to get half decent at a fighting game, and this is the first one I'm really trying at so this is from the perspective of someone that's kind of new to MK style fighting games (I've played games like Absolver also so the idea of frame data and actually understanding that stuff isn't new to me though).

I have to say that the story is amazing, loved every second of it.  Hopefully you do too if you get this because there's like 3-4 hours of glorious cutscenes.  Sometimes I even got frustrated if I couldn't beat a fight sequence that easily cause I was so excited to see what happened next in the story.

Moving on to the Towers of Time.  Yes, they're hard.  Yes, they seem unfair at times.  However, at the time of writing this review, NR has already made adjustments to them that made the AI easier all-around and even nerfed the AI's use of konsumables.  There's still plenty of difficulty to them and there's one fight that just seemed impossible for the longest time, but you just gotta keep trying or change it up.  There's one fight where I felt like I was constantly getting stunned and knocked out of combos.  So I decided to let the AI fighter have a go at the tower and they ended up accidentally dodging like 50% of the enemy's konsumables.  So then I tried again and guess what??  YOU CAN TOTALLY DODGE ALMOST ALL OF THE ENEMY KONSUMABLES IF YOU DON'T SPAM.  Yeah, there's gonna be times where you get stuck in a combo and can't dodge them, but that's just part of the fight. You can do the same thing to them and you can actually use your brain for yours.  The enemy usually just uses their konsumables whenever they get off cooldown, so watching their cooldowns helps a lot cause you have a good estimate of when it's gonna happen.
SUMMARY OF TOWERS OF TIME:  They're hard, stop whining.  NR has already actively been involved in balancing them post-release, things will change.

Next is my most heated subject on the game: Everybody that listened to those idiotic ""gAmE jOurNaLiStS"" that talked about the ""super expensive microtransactions.""  The premium currency, Time Krystals, can be used in the very small store to purchase from a small selection of randomly selected cosmetics.  That's not where you're supposed to get all of the cosmetics, you're supposed to EARN them.  The only use I see for the store is if you're so dead-set on getting a certain cosmetic that you check it every once in a while and just buy that cosmetic that you REALLY want.  Anyone that actually thinks you're intended to buy every cosmetic from the store is just an idiot.
Related to microtransactions are people complaining about the grind.  I see no reason to purchase this game if you're not gonna play it.  I've not played a massive amount and I still feel like I have plenty of currency laying around.  Obviously, if you purchase every single chest you run across in the Krypt, you're going to have to go get more currency.  The Krypt isn't a one time thing you clear out in a day or two, and I like that.  Also, anyone that says it takes a long time to gain levels on items, is wrong.  Each item only has two levels currently and you can easily get both by just doing a few towers.

Overall, great game.  People just fell on the hate train when people lied about the microtransactions.  There's also always gonna be that group of people that buy the game and immediately feel like they should have everything they want in the game without even trying to get good at it, which is where I think the ""grind"" complaints come from.  [b] It's hard to earn currency when you're sitting there trying to make the edgiest looking Erron Black guys, go do a tower or try pvp. [/b]

68,50510747,english,"[h1]A game for a very specific audience. [/h1]

I haven‚Äôt played a Mortal Kombat game since Armageddon, so this might be indicative of how in touch I‚Äôve been with the fighting game scene. So take this as a review specifically aimed at the average casual player. 


Before I get to the meat of the game, let‚Äôs get the chaff out of the way: Graphically it‚Äôs a stunning game. All the visual fidelity and fluidity that you expect is here, keeping up with their previous titles. The Krypt received, in my opinion, an overreaction, but make no mistake, it‚Äôs still a huge grind. There is a lot of content here. The Krypt itself is very nice to run around in, some cool little Easter eggs and references throughout and the puzzle elements to finding the unlockables and keys are quite nice. Currency is potentially going to be a problem. While coins are simple enough to get and you can do a tower or two and get enough to open a couple of chests, the soul fragments and hearts are another story entirely. There are a lot of different chest types, they aren‚Äôt very well explained as to how you unlock them, and when you finally realise how, you also become aware that getting the means of unlocking them is going to be a slog. 

This is compounded by other areas of the game such as the Towers of Time, which also require 25,000 coins to unlock their character specific versions, and which will require specific consumables to do some of the harder versions. On its own this isn‚Äôt an awful idea, it‚Äôs a fun little mode with some nice changes of pace and quirks. Sticking it behind a tax, for which you need to do regular towers for, starts to turn it from feeling like a game to a job. Time, as ever, is a commodity and everyone‚Äôs trying to get yours. It‚Äôs no less the case here. 

[b]On to the meat.[/b]

Objectively, this is a good game. 

It‚Äôs very apparent right from the outset that there is a surprising amount of nuance and consideration worked into the mechanics of the combat. The move away from the dial-a-combo, removing the run button, slowing the pace down and forcing a more deliberate and calculated process is objectively a good thing. This a game that rewards taking the time to learn the mechanics, rewards knowing which meters to use when, how to get out of specific situations, how to juggle, how to avoid being juggled, how to modify specific moves in specific contexts to your advantage. The tutorials are exhaustive, which is a good thing. They also produce rewards, which is a nice touch to just acknowledging the time sink of going through them. 

While this game is objectively solid, the skill ceiling is high and the nuance is there, it‚Äôs very clearly aimed at a specific audience. It seems like the game is geared more towards picking one character and learning them inside out, and more or less just ignoring the rest of the roster. Personally, I like a bit of variety, and there is variety here, but just experiencing it can become a real battle. If you‚Äôre the kind of person that just wants to go through the towers and unlock some endings, it‚Äôs quite simple, the basic tower is only five characters and takes max a half hour. But there‚Äôs a good chance that it‚Äôs not a specifically enjoyable half hour, unless you‚Äôve done prep work and done a half hour practice session with the character you‚Äôve picked. I‚Äôve always viewed the basic towers as the character practice, but that‚Äôs not the case here. 

The pacing of this game is fundamentally awkward. There is very little easy flow to be found. Mortal Kombat 11 has a very specific pace. It‚Äôs deliberate, but it‚Äôs not necessarily slow. Trying to rush down everything to get through content isn‚Äôt really going to work ‚Äì just closing distance can feel stilted and frustrating. Just learning attack ranges becomes an integral part of the process, and it‚Äôs jarring and infuriating when an attack that instinctively feels like it should connect, with a slight nudge of the shoulders, whiffs because the rigid t-rex arms just stop an inch away from a stationary opponent‚Äôs face and you miss. Character attacks have a very specific range, and you have to be practically standing on the other person‚Äôs toes to be sure of hitting them. There are not many chances to organically feel out some combos and variations here. Blocking is a matter of timing now ‚Äì it‚Äôs not the instantaneous damage cancel that it is in many other fighters and previous Mortal Kombat games. If you don‚Äôt anticipate an attack, you get hit. So you‚Äôre going to need to learn the wind ups and patterns of every other character, the directions they will attack from, and so on. It‚Äôs an extremely engineered product aimed at a very specific long-term audience. At times it feels very much like the Starcraft of fighting games. 

Again, this is all good. I will never criticise a game for deepening itself on a mechanical level. It‚Äôs starkly apparent that Mortal Kombat has matured from a button mashing kung-fu arcade game into a defined and considered product. It‚Äôs a good game and I can‚Äôt stress that enough. But it‚Äôs not easily accessible. You will get perhaps 8 hours out of the story mode, including cinematics, and that‚Äôs your easy mode where you can do whatever. The core of the game just has an inbuilt wall to it. The skill floor is actually surprisingly high and as a result of the tailoring and engineering that is all too apparent, it‚Äôs worth keeping in mind that Mortal Kombat 11 has surprisingly limited accessibility. It‚Äôs enjoyable, but that comes with a choke chain and the game has no hesitations about yanking on that choke chain.

I'm a big fan. I can see why some people are angry about the frame rate drop during certain aspects of the game, (chiefly the finishers). Also why some others are angry about the ""Koin Wall"" where they feel they need to purchase koins to komplete the Towers of Time. (Not to be confused to Klassic Towers, they function the same as before.)

But the fps drop is so minor for the flawless and seamless kombat gameplay that it is easily overlooked by me; I also think it makes the slow-mo look extra great.

Fluid kombat
Great story
Fun characters
Kustomisation

Audio desync during story cutscenes. Would resync after a fight but then get worse as they progressed.

I highly recommend switching to FXAA-only for this game. That solved all of my graphical issues. TLDR at the bottom.

That aside, the game is gorgeous, fighting is responsive and crisp, and the single-player modes are surprisingly compelling (for an MK game). For that alone, I recommend it. Don't buy a single microtransaction. Don't waste your time opening loot boxes. Everything else this game has to offer is a blast.

BUT - and this is a big deal - the microtransactions really *are* pathetic. Shadow of War / BF2 pathetic. First of all, they couldn't even bother to smooth out performance in the lootbox minigame ""Krypt"". It runs below 30 fps even on my up-to-date gaming rig. That's pretty sad. Secondly, the game pitches a bunch of different currencies, loot boxes, boosters and time-savers at you constantly.

It's like they don't want you playing the arcade mode without collecting items and currency - but the lootbox system is so unoptimized that it barely runs. It's such a strange paradox.

TLDR: the game is a blast and the single-player and online offerings are great!

Cons
-Bothersome grinds/farming for mundane/basic things that should have been available from start (imo) for example, maskless characters
-Online ALL the time.  If you have bad net, even playing solo sucks because if you d/c you will have to restart game
-Even with sending AI into tower battles, you still have to be there to click ""Kontinue"" to go to next fight so you cant afk farm and have to do nothing but watch.


Gameplay is good and I honestly don't care about the microtransactions.  My system runs 
playable at least solo (i dont play multiplayer online here lol) but the fact you have to be connected online all the time even soloing which is annoying.  I really shouldn't have to deal with game closing coz of server connection issues.  I know I don't have the best net, which is WHY im playing solo.  If you can have stable net all the time, then it shouldn't matter.

Also, what is the point of sending AI fighters to fight in say endless klassic tower if you still have to be there to press ""Kontinue"" to go to next stage?  That should be automatic so we can afk farm it, otherwise its boring as fuck to watch the ai fight when i can just actually play.

The grind in this type of game is dumb, especially when unlocking  mundane/basic stuff such as option for maskless fighters (ie katana, scarlet, subzero, ect).  Some of them you have to grind for ages, and some of them are through RNG so that grind could be fast, or could be exponentially longer than it needs.  Farming for currency and walking (no running) in the krypt opening chests and dropping shtiion of koins for a random chance at something you want is annoying.  I hate farming/grinding in this kind of game, and this is coming from someone who actually enjoys farming in RPG games, or games like monster hunter.

The Good
- Top notch fighting system. Fatal Blows can only be landed once per match. 35% damage keeps a wild card in each players hand and keeps matches suspenseful.
- Stage design is second to none. Goro's lair is brilliant. There are really no weak links in this department. They hit it out of the park with this.
- Tutorial mode is very deep and well designed for all levels of fighters.
- Story mode. They continue to set the standard. Corny plot lines straight out of an 80's movie with kick a$$ fight scenes. The kind of thing that is fun to geek out on.
- The gear system. Unlockables galore. Creating skins and collecting gear is something I've asked for for years. Soul Calibur came close years ago with create-a-character but a rewarding loot system feels great in a fighting game like this. The ability to make your Jax look way different from anyone else's.
- Fatalities and brutalities are entertaining.
- Multiple dialogues between two fighters. They do not always say the same thing to each other. Even when the same to fighters meet multiple times.
- The Krypt. I heard some gamers complain about the Krypt. Yes it does suck to open a 15,000 chest and get concept art. Yes the old Krypt was static and you could share info on where to find the good stuff. This one feels more random. But It is deep and acts like a MK museum. It is an adventure game all in itself with areas designed like classic MK levels. Lore to read through. Items to collect to unlock areas. Much moreso than MK10. I thought I'd just go pick up a few things after playing and ended spending all 650,000 in one sitting. I couldn't step away. How can I complain about something that keeps me that engaged. Even if it does sting me occasionally.
- Online mode netcode seems very solid in my limited time online.

Cons
- Wish I received more currency for local and online fights.
- A lot of the systems feel helter skelter. The store is currently lame with limited time offers. Towers are also on timers so if you want certain items you better be there and have the time to sink into the tower to unlock the stuff. Or else wait for it to come around again.
- I spent $100 on the big version with the pack. I feel like I should have access to all the gear if I want to grind for it. Not have to scan the towers and store daily to see if it comes up.
- No Goro... BUT the did my man justice in the stage and in the Krypt

FINISH HIM!
Overall this is the new standard of fighting game. I've been a Street Fighter kid my whole life. Still love SFV even if people try to trash it. But MK11 took the success of 10 and built a brilliant game. One that will have many years of shelf life and currently wears the fighting game crown.

30,50484255,english,"I've spent a lot of time now playing MK11 on PC.  I've seen the crash fixes, the delays in getting patch content to bring parity to PS4.  None of that affects my review, but the thing that affects my review the most is easily the Towers of Time.  This is a review from a casual who's played every Mortal Kombat since 1 in the arcades.  The tl;dr: The Towers of Time are the most frustrating, depressing experience I've ever had in any Mortal Kombat, let alone a fighting game.

The internet has taken to playing follow the leader making a Noob Saibot AI to do the work for them due to Noob's AI being really good for grinding towers.  I, however did not go that route as that's not how I wanted to play the game; I mix between a Kitana AI and manually jumping in to play myself.  I have played with and without modifiers to tailor this experience the best that I can to my liking.  Suffice to say this experience is not to my liking, and it can be tied to modifiers the AI uses in ToT.

There are modifiers designed to interrupt your combos, slow you down, drain health, literally have epileptic moments with turning the lights on and off.  Some of them are flat out unblockable, not even low.  This is on top of AI designed around input reading with higher tier AI having more health with all of this going on.  You are not fighting just the AI, you are fighting the system modifiers on top of AI difficulty.  Coming from someone who flat out says 'I am bad at this game' this experience has been horrible on someone who just wanted to turn the game on, kick ass, sign off and go do work or something.  Why am I torturing myself doing this?  Because there's literally functionality content (Brutalities) locked behind these towers that you can't get in the Krypt.  There are some cool skins and gear you cannot get anywhere else but completing these Towers of Time.  ToT has taken away so much of my time trying to beat the system instead of, you know...learning to play the game with my friends because there's gear I want locked behind them.

Please...never again.  Never do these Towers of Time ever again, and if you do not in this iteration.  NetherRealm tried something new and it was a disaster.  It was a disaster at launch, and for people like me after they toned it down it's still a disaster of frustration and depression (disclaimer: the depression comment is not a metaphor for anything, I already suffer from anxiety and depression and this experience was having me spiral downward.)",1557017965,1557017965,False,5,0,0.554054081439971924,0,True,False,False,76561197972451949,301,1,6489,0,2508,1560047531,,

But... the premium currency in this game is practically useless, so there's no reason to ever buy it, so it doesn't make sense that the game would be designed like this? Mobile games aren't like that because it's fun, they're like that because it makes people buy stuff! And a $60 game where most of the content is locked behind all of that un-fun mobile game RNG grindy nonsense just feels frustrating and kind of gross! Why would you make a $60 fighting game that feels like a bad mobile clicker and doesn't even justify it by trying to make money like one? It doesn't make any sense!

[*]To get extra intros/outros, Fatalities/Brutalities and costumes you have to grind a lot of different virtual currencies.
[*]This grind is made worse because you cannot directly buy what you want, but have to open boxes with random content.
[*]You can buy your way out of this grind, by spending real money on the in game shop.
[*]The stuff in the in game shop is random too. One day you could buy a specific costume, the next it could be gone.
[*]The main way to make in game money and stuff is barred behind time gating, further randomness and strange mechanics, that interfere with your fights.
[*]No option for skimpy outfits for women. Character design wildly different than former games in the series (ugly in my opinion - both men and women). NRS justifies the lack of female skimpy outfits with moral. ""Sexualiziation"" is bad. Of course it's only bad when you talk about women. Men in this game are sexualized plenty. I cannot stand companies which take their customers for fools.

Other than that: The combat is solid. If you like MK combat, you won't be dissapointed. If you like fast paced games like DoA, KoF, GG and SF then MK11 could bore you, especially after seeing annoyingly prolonged throws and fatal blows again and again. It just hinders the gameplay. Also some animations in the game look strangely crude and clunky and some inputs seem to get lost, resulting in failed combos or special moves.

37,50482761,english,"If I could I'd give this a neutral review, but Odin forbid that be an option. I say this despite, the amount of sh*t talk I'm about to type out here. If you're only approaching this as a competitive fighter, you won't have too many gripes. The game feels pretty solid and is enjoyable in versus, playing against friends and anonymous online people. It's a matter of skill, ""git gud"" learning your strengths, reading, baiting, punishing whiffs, and all that fun stuff that comes with the fighting genre. A loss sucks but, it doesn't feel demoralizing most of the time. 

That being said, many the aspects of solo play feel like either the publisher or developers don't have much respect for their fan-base/consumers. Klassic Towers aren't too bad and still pretty fun. Towers of Time whoever feels like an RNG luck grind hoping you don't get an insanely unbalanced match-up that's erroneously labeled ""medium"" difficulty when the enemy AI full bars you for a mistake. You should get punished for a mistake but, I don't feel a medium difficulty should demand you grind an RNG lootpool for the right tools just for that match-up. 

One could argue that gearing is necessary in other game genres so I understand that can translate to ToT game-play, but normally you would grind specific quests or areas that you know yielded what you need. The completely RNG aspect for konsumables is pouring salt in wounds. The developers can say they're fixing things all they want. They released this game with the core aspect of their solo play to prey on people's patience and time. Feigning ignorance or playing the hero when you release a demonstrably questionable system in the first place shouldn't net you brownie points. 

If a developer wants you to spend countless hours in their game that time should be EARNED, not be an assigned chore if you want to experience and earn items built into the game. No, I don't expect a handout, I just kinda desire a game to make me enjoy wanting to play, not feeling I HAVE to play and be frustrated when the AI pain train steamrolls through my HP with  DoTs stacked on top of heavy hits. The system is akin to some of the more heinous aspects of Korean MMORPG ports but, worse; because you can still rather enjoy a good portion of those games before you hit the wall. MK11 has that solo experience wall right in your face; from the get go, inscribed with a throbbing phallic ""f**k you"", mushroom-stamping you for ever trying to step up to it (lol).

If you only want to play this game to play against friends and just fight, I would recommend the game. If you want to experience the entirety of the game to obtain kosmetics, be a completionist, and still enjoy yourself, I advise you to not bother, or wait until the game goes on sale in a year if you're feeling stubborn.

38,50429568,english,"The fact that people cry that the story sucks is flat out lie, this MK has the BEST story it's light years ahead of MK X, and it has more drama and love interests and funny moments.


This review, I will go over all aspects of the game to my experience so far.

The ones that buy this for the story, it has a better story than MK X, it has more drama, no quick time events this time thank god.
During cut scenes just before a fight if there are 2 characters on the screen for example Liu Kang and Kung Lao you press left of right on the D-pad on the controller.
The story like I said for my taste is a lot better than X.

The gameplay has variations again however you can change what moves to keep and change the ones you don't want, which is a great thing because with variations you're forced to lose some special moves.
Each character can unlock a lot of things like cosmetic items, intro animations, win poses.

They changed the X-Ray's how they work, they are not called that they are called ""fatal blows"" and can be executed when the opponent has roughly less than 30% health, if you miss by the opponent blocking or too far away the meter will recharge and you can do it again.

A big change is that the game focuses on opponent's mistakes for example if they do a move or a attack and they miss if you do an counter attack like upper cut you will do a lot more damage than usual and goes sorta like in a X-Ray zoomed in cut scene with a small text on the opponent's life bar shows as ""punish""
The game play is slower than X, I like it I'm not 20 years old no more so my reflexes are not what it used to be. :D

Test your luck and might a modes are gone.

The kript it's not that bad the most expensive chest I came across so for is 15000 coins and you get 100.000 in 2 chests before you step in the kript and you can get coins easy enough through other game modes.

Towers of time personally I find it alright in the difficulty spike it's not like completely unfair and i suck at fighting games.
Overall the game is better than MK X.
I'm not giving the microtransactions a pass they don't belong in a full priced game.

The game runs pretty well I had one crash in 7 hours at Shao Kahn when I preformed a fatality on tower of time tutorial.

I'm leaving a negative review on every single fighting game that resorts to input-reading to make their AI's ""hard""

IT'S FUCKING 2019 GUYS. THERE HAVE TO BE BETTER WAYS TO MAKE YOUR AI'S CHALLENGING AND NOT ""CHALLENGING""

Also this game's ""modifiers"" for the towers of time are fucking stupid. It also doesn't help the the last person at the top of the tower I'm currently attempting has a fuckton of health to boot.

Me: ""Oh hey, that deadly blow did almost nothing to the AI's fucking health-bar. Oh goody, these Mileena sais flying across the screen not only go really fast across, but ALSO come in twos AND reverse your controls. And the AI is input-reading the shit out of me so the extra health just seems like a slap in the face.""

This is not a good time.

EDIT: They've changed the towers so that they're not as awful anymore. Modifiers that strike you (such as missiles and sais) can be blocked now. Rewards are better for the towers now. I believe the health of the final opponent in a tower of time hasn't been changed but JUST THE FACT that you can block modifiers now makes it much MUCH better.

45,50430254,english,"1) Beautiful fighting game (really one of the best what we have) but not beautiful Mortal Kombat game. 
Developers did a great job with mechanics, they are just gorgeous and very interesting to master. 
Graphics look fantastic and the game feels very smooth after all.

2) The  problem is that they (Developers) kinda sold their asses. With that stupid in game shop, with all that political context in campaign, they even made female characters unsexy because feminists tolled them to. Well, at least MK series will live some time more because of this (welcome to 2019).

3) 3.1) Campaign- if you never played any MK games then you will not understand ~65% of what is happening. I have played MK Advance (Bullsheet, its garbage), Armageddon, Deadly Alliance, Unchained, MK 9 and it was still really hard to understand what is going on. So maybe you should read stories of previous MK games. After all campaign is not bad, but it is certainly not the best (funny because Ed Boon promised us the best story in the history of Mortal Kombat).

3.2) Krypt- I do not want to spoiler how it looks like, but it is really the best krypt that ever existed. The only problem is that you might not understand how to open certain doors, so you have to google or watch on Youtube the walkthrough.

3.3) Multiplayer (including Towers etc.) - Very cool and fun to play! You will spend a lot of hours in towers, because they change after certain time. You get resources, value and new items for characters by completing them. The real problem here is that sometimes if you play with other players against AI you might get problems with synchronization and just get kicked back to the menu. 

3.4) Customization- new level of customization. You can change everything what your character has. Even the fighting style, by editing special moves. 

4) Here are the REAL PROBLEMS- I) 30 FPS in cut scenes, Krypt, Main menu, Fatal Blows, everywhere except for fights (there is unofficial patch that unlocks 30 FPS limit, but you might download virus). II) Grinding currencies (Gold, Souls, Hearts). You can even let the AI play for you to grind resources. III) Sometimes connection problems.

47,50479486,english,"Just ignore those Reviews complaining about Grind, Microtransactions and Outfits

MK11 is an awesome game with an nice story mode which continues the story of MK9 and MKX

Sure I could complain about grinding currency to unlock new cosmetic items like everyone else but idk like in the past no one complained because they had stuff to do in the game to unlock new stuff.

So yeah a bland grind sucks but the opposite which is nothing to unlock sucks as well.

Tower of Times yeah about those, first days they where terrible but since the latest patch they got a lot better, like I'm not the best when it comes to games like MK,SF,Tekken or so on but I can beat most of them and for those I can't beat I just use AI to fight for me which works surprisingly well

About Microtransactions..... I don't actually see a reason to use them, sure there are skins or other cosmetic stuff in there but everything in there is easy obtainable ingame and if not the currency for the shop are time stones which right now as I'm writing this I have around 4000 of without spending money and to be fair MK11 isn't the first game that even though it's an fill price title still sell cosmetics.

Now to the Outfits... a lot of people complain because the female outfits are less revealing which is true but nonetheless even though less revealing they are still sexy and if you really want to see more there is still rule 34 for you. 
The only problem I see with the Outfits is that some characters get a wide amount of different skins but other characters like Noob just get 50 shades of black.

But what I really like about this game is that NRS addresses issues of the community, first they lowered the difficulty of the ToT, we get more Koins from dragon challenges and more currency in general and not live right now for PC but for consoles is an lowered amount of Fatalities,Brutalities needed for the character specific towers

60,50476092,english,"This game is great. I have no-lifed the past two Mortal Kombat games MK9 and MKX. What I can tell you is this:

-The micro-transactions in this game are not troubling to me whatsoever. I'm sick and tired of seeing reviews that say ""ermergerrd the micro transactions, I cant BUY what I need to EARN by playing the da** game""! If you are a true MK fan, you know that it has always been this way with krypt, and that you must earn most of what you desire, get lucky, or look up how to get it. Simple. Stop crying about grinding because it really is not that hard.
-The game is much more balanced now in regards to the fighting mechanics and/or character customization. I'll give you an example, I like to use Liu Kang. Default moves for Liu Kang do not include projectile parries, which would mean a character like Noob Saibot would have destroyed me in MK9 with projectiles. Now, in compensation you can replace other special moves with better ones to your preference or that better round the character's offense/defense. I could delve into this or you could look into it yourself, I think you get what I mean. And also the game mechanics don't really allow me to do 50% juggle combos anymore so you're lucky. You have more opportunities to ""be like water"" and/or adapt and defend yourself.
-The online multiplayer has MASSIVELY improved, to the point it has made me proud...but it still has its flaws. I played the MK9 and MKX ports....trust me...be grateful. In a nutshell, about 1 out of 10 searches/matches you may disconnect in MK11. UI is much more simplified and it is so much easier to find games/lobbies. Before, I found that MK online was impertinent due to its inoperable lag, but now I can rightfully destroy a spamming noob due to the contrivance of timing rather than getting rekt by the opponents cancerous dial-up internet and spamming. If you decide you do not want to play someone, you can choose to search next player because of their connection or fps. Basically, the devs know the online still has some flaws, excusable for now imo, but they have compensated with easier, simpler, and (if this match is inoperable I can easily search for a new game with 1 click of a button) faster UI.
-I'm glad I can harp a little on the story now, I'm getting kind of tired of writing this. Ergo, the concept of time travel has really allowed the gamer to immerse themselves in the mortal kombat universe. No, you may not be able to play every character (and cry about new characters, yes...we know..you want every character that ever existed to be in one game) but this story line has succeeded in giving the players a chance to decide on which characters they like in addition to being entertained. It is literally like a movie and you get to play the fight scenes, experiencing every character, as you have been able to before. And as always from MK, you can expect surprises and/or rewards for the special little snowflake you are.

I hope by now you have an idea of the pros and cons and you can decide whether or not this game is for you rather than enumerating your disdains. If you love MK, trust me, you'll like the game. There are just some things you must adapt to find your latent joy in this game.",1556986884,1556986970,True,1,1,0.523216307163238525,0,True,False,False,76561198293703397,18,1,3375,0,1291,1593479038,,

62,50474639,english,"So far - I'm liking the game. And I'm liking it's PC port. And I say this after taking the first day patch fiasco, Towers of Time pains, so called ""mobile economics"" and preordering. And I'm nothing special at fighting games, so it's not my beloved genre.

People like to comment about how MK11 has a greedy bussiness model, but really - it doesn't. You gain nothing for cash besides an option to buy something you will earn in-game anyway at some point. I guess it could be argued, that with 4 different currencies it's bound to be greedy, but all currencies make sense, when you think for a moment about the crypt. All of them do different things and just perusing the crypt is fun in itself.

Sound and graphics are top notch. I get that some people have some technical issues, but I'm not one of them, so I can't really comment on that. I play on an AMD based machine from about 4 years ago, and the only thing I noticed is a weird way Kano's chest hair behave.

Fighting mechanics are really polished and fun, I like how different characters work differently and you get a feeling for whom you are playing. I like how you have to commit to a combo string (like in Injustice 2), and how careful each fight can be. Tutorial in this game is golden and really helped me to get a grasp on what those fighting mechanics actually are.

Story mode is ok - nothing much to say here, but it's cool it's there, and if you know and like these characters - it's even cooler.

Classic Towers are just fun arcade way to play the game. You remember MK from arcades, right? Well, you just start a tower and play to completion. I find it kind of strange that boss of each classic tower has a bit different mechanics and it gets me out of my groove, but I get that this is a boss and they decided to make it a bit different.

Towers of Time - well, here your mileage may vary. Some of them I can take on with my less-than-middle-of-the-road skill. Some of them make me so frustrated I want to scream. If anything, I would vote for making them a bit easier, but then again - there are players better than me. Consumable system wouldn't be my choice, but it can work and when you get used to it, it might be better than mutators working for both fighters at once like in injustice.

Netcode is good from what I've heard and seen, but after getting my ass kicked so many times I just stopped testing it for now.

It's a good game and mixed reviews are actually kinda harmful. There was (and quite possibly still is) a bit of commotion around it, some controversy and some less-that-good communication from developers, but it does not take away from quality of the game. If you like MK, if you like fighting games or if you'd like to learn this genre - this is a good title for you.

The game Checks to see if you have any compatible hardware with your computer, such as a Razer Chroma v2 keyboard and a GTX 1080 Graphics card, then it asks if you would like these to be integrated with the game for some outstanding results, the game automatically records any great kombo's you make, or any fatalities or Finishing Blows, then with the keyboard EVERYTHING seems to have a different keyboard colour scheme, the Menu's have one matching the display, the loading screen is gold and spins around the keyboard, and most amazingly, EVERY skin seems to light the keyboard in an alternate way, for example, if you're playing Sub-Zero, by default the keyboard will light up as dark blue, although if you equip a green skin, the keyboard will become green, if the skin is dual coloured, eg mostly green but with light blue highlights, the keyboard will match this, the keys will mostly be green but some will be light blue, Additionally, when you perform a finishing blow, the keyboard will match the motions of the kill, for example if the character was to pull back their arm to throw a spear, the keyboard will light up, then the keys will go brighter towards the left, to symbolise you pulling back the spear, then when the spear is thrown, the keys will remove their colour from left to right, so it matches the spear being thrown into the target, It is truely astounding the amount of work netherrealm has put into this game, i am very pleased, best PC release they have had yet this goes for Netherrealm and WarnerBrothers, (I am aware there was a little hitch at the start, but that happens for all steam preorders, and i am willing to look  past that for how fantastic this game truly is!) I truly cannot wait for the next Injustice game if it follows this games example!


Pros:

-Epic Story Line, One of the greatest Mortal Kombat story lines to date, with great potential for the future

-Good Selection of Characters, the game contains all my favourites (Good DLC potential)

-Great Level of Customisation of characters

-Entertaining new take on the Krypt

-Easy to play, challenging to master

-Great Menu Structure

-Outstanding PC integration

-Great PC Option settings

Cons:

-Frame Rate locking to 30fps in certain areas of the game (Although i believe mods can remove this, im unsure if mods are safe as of yet though

- A few people are missing their favourite characters (Reptile, Mileena)

I would rate the game 9.5/10, the only reason for the lack of 0.5 is the framerate locking, but if i can mod this without issue / if the devs remove this, it will be a solid 10 for me.",1556044241,1556972287,True,1,0,0.488283246755599976,0,True,False,False,76561198061072734,584,12,3326,0,41,1558722175,,

No. Are they necessary and make the game play to win? Absolutely not. They are just for in game currencies that will help you unlock cosmetics and certain finishers in the Krypt.

+ Fantastic gameplay that's better than in any previous game in the series,
+ Story, while not amazing, is enjoyable and quite fun to play through.
+ Towers of Time are enjoyable and keep me coming back to the game after the update made them more balanced.
+ Lots of kostumization, a lot of the skins are purely just re-colors but even then the new feature is a fun way for players to personalize their experience even further.
+ Fantastic in-depth tutorials that goes into details most fighting games wouldn't, such as frame data and how to extend and come up with your own combos.
+ Fantastic state-of-the-art graphics and phenomenal sound design.
+ More gruesome than ever before.

Cons
- Krypt is a huge grind, prices for items that are required for progression in it are way too expensive and most of the time are simply a waste of your time.
- Desync issues in online are quite common.
- Ranked is a mess in it's current state, where the other player can simply leave the game before he loses so that the loss doesn't go on his record.
- (As of now) the updates for PC port are often behind the two major consoles and communication with the dev team is almost non-existent for PC players.
- Serious lack of Toasties.

Played 5 hours so far and no problems what so ever. Not to mention it supports 3840x1080 Super Ultra Wide and the experience playing it fullscreen borderless on my Samsung CHG90 is INCREDIBLE! I have high specs and a fast internet connection and everything works flawless so far. The new tutorials a really a nice touch for new players, as well. 

I did have to turn off bloom, blur and TSAA to get things looking nice and crisp. I usually turn off these graphical features anyways as they are usually more distracting than helpful in games.

Do i hate the grind? Yes
Do i think they should make it less tedious (talking after the first patch which made it kind of okay now)? Yes.
Do i agree with the people REEEE-ing? No!

Every microtransaction is for cosmetics! Grow the fuck up people!
If you only want to be good at the game, go play onlines and don't worry about the Krypt or the TOT!
If you want a certan skin, just playing the game gets you the premium currency, albeit rather slowly. This means that if you only paly onlines, and level up there, you'll be able to get a skin from the store, and if one pops up that you wanted, then huzzah!
And don't come at my neck with blades because of augments! They only improve your AI fighters or help you get more loot.  It does NOT make you stronger in actual PVP.

This game is NOT pay 2 win. It's pay 2 fashion or pay 2 not grind. 

But i do wana talk about other things as well:
Story: I LOVE IT! I LOVE-LOVE-LOVE IT! Altough i did get spoilt before i played it for myself, i was still pleasantly suprised as to how it was done. Sure a few things are still in the air but hey! Netherrealm is making progress in the story department even more!
The variation system: It was rather confusing when i first heard of it in the Kombat Kasts but after fiddling around with it, i grew to like it.
The Krypt: One step closer to one of my all time favoutrite mode of all time: MK Deceptions Konquest mode.
Yea burn me alive other long time players! I actually loved MKDE-s Konquest mode! And i think they should do one in the next game, instead of the Krypt.

I could go on but why bother? Those who like the game are still playing it, those who hate it already left and are probably playing something completely different, or playing MK9 or MKX.

5,50351070,english,"Mortal Kombat 11. Solid fighting game and worth the money.

Multiplayer matchmaking has been solid, haven't had any problems with netcode either. 
Gameplaywise I enjoy how the fighting is paced, how combos work and such. Fatal blows are a fresh change, gives that extra spice for both players to be wary of. Easily one of my favourite fighters already.
Tutorials were useful and easy to understand, you really should check them out if you're new to the fighter genre.

Graphics are really pleasing and the game looks very polished. Character models are gorgeous and stages beautiful. Stage backgrounds have been improved massively from MKX.
Performance with i5-8600k and GTX 1060 has been flawless, maxed out graphics and steady 60fps.

I enjoyed playing story mode alot, it had nice cutscenes and overall the story felt good. Time travelling mixed up the story in a good way, and I really enjoyed character interactions. Can't wait for sequels to find out which direction the story takes from now on.

I've done some towers of time and haven't encountered much frustration towards them yet. Yeah some of them can be tricky and have annoying modifiers but nothing I could not complete yet. Towers are not really my thing though. I'm mostly here for multiplayer.

I know that there is alot of outrage about the cosmetic microtransactions, however I decided completely leave it out of the review because I absolutely do not care about it since it has no effect how the game plays out. In the end its a fighting game and skins do not really matter. Maybe if you really like collecting ingame cosmetics then I would not get this.",1556371380,1556905388,True,3,0,0.521591901779174805,0,True,False,False,76561198042079212,111,4,1954,0,580,1557392333,,
6,50301429,english,"Updated review (3 of may 2019) 
so after playing for a while , exactly 45 hours i just gave up. the grinding of this game  its just pure torture and is not worth the pain.  so there is a couple of things they fixed and some others are still bad  : 


-FXAA +TAA issues with ghosting and blurry effect on characters have been fixed for the most part  , there is still  issues with the ghosting and artifacts during fatalities and fatal blow/crush.

-Desync during towers wher you need to play with two other players to defeat the tower bosses. 

-i cant close the game ,the screen goes black and it freeze i have to reset the computer every time im trying to close the game.

-they fixed the currencies issues in the sense that now you earn more and its a bit easier... but there is a little trap. you see, after you unlocked all the chest in the krypt and you have nothing to do ,you can restore them expending money. i just spend 450k of koins just to restore all the chest in the krypt and guess what... something that the game dont tell you ,the restored chest dont give you skins  or gear  , i didnt know that... i wasted 500k of koins  just to get  konsumables , augments and concept art at best... doesnt matter what kind of chest you are opening it could be from 1k chest to 15k chest and they will give you the same rewards.

the grinding its obnoxious and make you sick of playing... do the math. each match last between 30-60 seconds , i have been playing for 45 hours ,lets argue that i have been playing the towers of time for 40 hours.. so how many fight  did i play  during those 40 hours ? just to unlock garbage that i dont care at all and waste millons of koins for nothing. 

i bought the premium edition and at this point i dont want to suffer with the grinding ,its just not worth it. im sick of this game im burned out , i quit.  i dont have the patient to return and play again when the kombat packs are released ,im just sick of doing all this chores just so i can try to unlock the skin or gear i want.  50 hours is not worth to spend  just for a stupid skin.

i still would not recommend this game  ... its just obnoxious.


------------------------------------------
Old review when the game was released :


Look , i didnt want to write a negative review ,because most of what i read  ,felt like minor issues that could be fixed through patches , but the more i played ,the more annoyed i felt about this game.  there is so many bad things to say ,that i will rather just put a list of them.   (BTW , there is mayor spoilers in here ,so dont read if you didnt beat the story mode  )

CONS:
-there is some kind of issue with the Anti aliasing.  using FXAA+TAA  during the characters intro and after the combat ends in the story mode ,there is this weird ghosting ,blurry effect and the characters models look like they are in the lowest settings when this happen

-audio delay in cutscenes ,  not sure what is triggering this , there is scenes  ,where the characters are just talking and the audio dont match with their mouth  and some other scenes where there is a heavy fight the audio its just out of sync ,explosions , punch effects and etc are delayed for 2 sec.}

-Massive drop of frame rates in the war scene:  when the heroes group are fighting against the army of kronica ,the frames drop really badly + out of sync audio.

-Bugged tutorials :   while doing the tutorial about learning about frames ,  there is this odd bug that dont register what you are doing ,something as simple as  doing  left down + A  , you have to do it 3 times ,but  you get stuck after doing 2 of 3 times you are request to do it .

Now this is a  subjective one : The main story... is AWFUL. it repeat the same pattern over and over until it gets dull. (AGAIN WARNING ,SPOILERS ) 

1- character A  is angry , so character B try to calm them down ,but character A say "" NO! screw u ! "" then you fight them and all of sudden character A is like ""ok ,i trust you lol sowwy "" 

2- plot -hole about the  past and present characters , so sonya realize that whatever she does to past kano that hurt present kano , so she kills him like this.  then we have another scene showing that  young johnny gets shot in the face and that appears to present johnny as a scar. BUT , there is many scenes where you fight as the present character beating the shit out of young or past character and they are fine , like they dont get hurt for hitting each other.

3-characters death... they are so underwhelming or silly... they dont die in battle or in some kind of epic farewell for them ,they just stand there like idiots talking and getting backstabbed or shot in the face.... is so silly.

this is how it works basically   ,you fight them ,then in the cutscen they are staring at u  or at some object that is going to fall on them , they dont try to fight back or move out of the way... they look like looney toons characters ,you can even picture the moment that they should have a sign on them saying ""help :( ""  before they die.

4-Cetrion  , kollector ,geras and Kronica have to be worst and  one dimensional characters of the game ,they are so boring to listen to, 
basically  this is their personality : 

Cetrion  = mommy issues
Kronica =  ""bwahaha i  control time  ,so im evil! wooo "" 
Kollector =  is like that harry potter character dobby.  ""oh shao khan gave me food and shelter so he is my  sugar daddy "" 
Geras =  ""you cant beat me   , i cant die! ""  yea ,whatever you said terminator.

then we have the  microtransactions.  so you have the in game currency (coins ) then you have the PREMIUM currency. (time crystal)   ,now you can say that you could unlock everything if you invest 100-200 hours in the game or maybe more. but thats not the issue , the krypt is random ,so is like gambling ,you are opening chest without knowing what you are going to get   and no is not like the previous krypt ,this time they are even more random ,because they are using  the gacha games type of gameplay. so you could spend all your money in one chest thinking that you are getting the best items and maybe you just end up getting common items... so you have to grind again and again and wish that you are going to get a good item... by that definition they act like LOOTBOXES.

so i cant accept that a game like MK  ,that already sells really well   ,use this kind of gacha/freemium/mobile type of gameplay in a full price game.  so is not enough selling so many version of the game (GOTY edition ,SPECIAL EDITION ,PREMIUM EDITION , DLC  , KOMBAT PASS ,KOMBAT PACK  )  , hell there is two stores in the game.  normal store (where you can buy the season pass and time crystals  )and a PREMIUM STORE that who knows what they are going to shove in there.

this is awful ,in every way.... i dont understand what they were thinking with this and i know , im only saying bad stuff about the game ,  there is good stuff in there ,but is overshadowed by this obnoxious  and greedy mechanics  that its just not worth your time.  im sure they are going to patch it in the future ,but NOW... is not worth your money.",1556116240,1556904941,False,28,1,0.56694328784942627,2,True,False,False,76561198243308534,141,24,3855,0,343,1570730298,,

* Had no technical issues as of yet
* Best graphics in a fighting game currently

Bad things:

* Female characters do not look like cheap strip tease pole dancers any more
* Tower difficulty
* Frames are a tad to short for my taste, giving you little time to react and it even makes animations look bad in many cases ...
* Bad for beginners, you basically have to learn the piano to play those combos, DOA6 is far more intiutitve for example and features new systems like hold-block-attack triangles.
* That dedicated block button, make it ""back"" like in nearly every other game ....

I like that the female cast deon't look like a stripper ourfit anymore, but I think they overdid it a bit too much in some aspects.
The game is fun and besides some balancing issues at the start in the ""tower of time mode"" the game is getting patched and feeling better and better.

The Bad: Audio Desync in cut scene (happened one time so far). Some of the levels Texturing (water and blood) looks terrible. Beware that you can unlock Frost in story mode you don't have to pay $6. Fatality,crushing blow,Krypt,menu and cutscene are 30FPS. GAME IS NOT FULLY OPTIMIZE for low end PC. Still issues with the RGB keyboard setting that makes player Desync after win or fatality.

There is a Mod that unlocks 60FPS and fixed audio desync link :https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXo51gTGKDs&t=14s

The Good: The Story is Excellent good replay value. The Customization for characters are awesome and there is a lot to unlock keeps the replay value high.Tower of time was a grind fest when the game came out and most situation was unbeatable but the recent patch fixed the level of difficulty and its enjoyable now. Krypt is back and its cool that it takes place on Shang Tsung island. The Tutorial is also very good teaches you all the mechanics of the game for beginners.

Graphics: 
Great

Gameplay: 
Great

Grind/monetization: 
Even after updates, there's A LOT of unnecessary grind. Feels almost if you play a mobile game, however, monetization is pretty clever. This grind makes it's hard to get something YOU WANT, then, there's a shop with 5 or 6 random items/day that can be bought with premium currency, making it's so there's no way or point on wasting lots of money in one day, however, once thing you want gets there, you know what can happen.  
Also, kombat pack doesn't cover all DLCs you see. Frost (can be unlocked in story mode, absolute scam) and Shao Kahn are NOT included. Gold Demon Scorpion seems to be included, but not released yet.

Character redesign: 
Not a fan, but they aren't ugly as some people claim them to be.

PC Port: 
Gameplay-wise, everything works like it should be. However, story audio is not synced (you can do a few tricks to make it less worse, just google it), there's also a few lags when you meet a new character (again, story mode ""feature""). Also, game often tries to connect to it's servers to sync your profile data. Even though I understand that it's there to slow down piracy, it gets on my nerves as someone who bought this game.
Also, I should mention that there's no crashes. 

Overall, as someone who enjoys single player a bit more than multiplayer, even given the good gameplay, I cannot recommend the game for now.

- frame rate cap in fatal blows, cut scenes, main menu

A solid fighting game with a great story but it is being held down by the appalling proggression system. Krypt is a random lootbox minigame, items you get need to be upgraded through gameplay individually (for example you get another pair of glasses for Johnny the progression you had on the first ones isnt transferred in the bit.) Towers of time are all sorts of messed up with the modifiers being way too frequent. Atleast in MKX the Krypt wasn't randomized so you could get the stuff you really wanted. Feels like the whole Krypt was left in the state it was in development when the Battlefront 2 fiasco took place.

PC port is also hot garbage and literally unfinished as its TWO PATCHES BEHIND CONSOLE VERSION. Yes, you read that right, this is a early access beta version of the game that they sold on PC as a finished product, but non only is it buggier and shittier overall, but the frame data for combatants is different as well, making this version radically different to consoles in character balance in competitive play.

I bought this as a huge fan but with the response they are giving and broken promises I was considering a refund and honestly regret spending the money on the game. They lost a customer in me going forward.

EDIT May 3rd 2019: PC version got a few patches that fixes a lot of crashes, rebalances the economy and brings the game up to date with the PS4 version, which includes the frame data. The game still experiences the occasional desync but is in much better state overall and the grind is now, although still present and probably overdone, at least feasible as the towers are much easier to complete.

I am changing my review to positive now, especially considering as the core gameplay is just so good.

gtx 1060 i5 7600k, all max settings perfect framerate, ive found that the game looks best with no AA and 16x anistropic filtering. bloom, motion blur, and vsync all off

will continue to edit as i continue playing

[h1]pros (not sure if most of these are new or returning)[/h1]
-game looks damn good (like i said AA looks awful but it looks great with anistropic filtering
-its mortal kombat
-its fun
-theres a new short hop mechanic? thats pretty cool? i think
-great tutorials (so far, havent done char tutorials yet)
-options are GREAT, theres tons and tons of useful options i didnt even know i wanted, like the ability to make special moves require the diagnal input (so you dont do something like dash forward to d1 and get a special instead), all kinds of stuff its great
-can now change story mode difficulty (no more 3v1s or quicktime events :) )
-menus are nice
-music is absolutely great, really caught me off guard with how good it is
-loading screen after picking stage seems to show a little animation thats personalized to which two characters are playing are really nice (if thats whats happening, theyre very small and you dont really see them long)
-remixed mk movie music is really nice (idk if thats used in game i just know it was there for a trailer)
-cutscenes look great, and without spoiling anything, the early one with a lot of emotional impact really hit me harder than i any other mk cutscene has before, [strike]story might still be shitty but its got some great moments already[/strike]
-the story, ill detail my thoughts on the story at the bottom with pros and cons, but overall i think it was damn good


[h1]cons[/h1]

[b]-updates are delayed for pc and switch versions, as of writing this (3 days after) we still dont have the day 1 patch, we'll get it eventually but this is still completely unacceptable and as a result my review will not change to positive until we get 3 to 5 patches in a row that launch at the same time for at least xbox ps4 and pc, nintendo has a longer approval process)[/b]
-mileena kick still exists
-vvvvv
-FROST IS AVAILABLE FOR PURCHASE AS DAY 1 DLC---- which is fine, but it NEEDS to be specified in the description (above the description of the character herself!!!) [b]that she (FROST) is UNLOCKABLE and DOES NOT NEED TO BE PURCHASED TO HAVE A FULL ROSTER[/b]
-grind (ill explain my personal thoughts at the bottom of this review)
-^
-^^^^
-^^^^^^^^
-^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
-^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
-the aa is weirdly blurry and has this weird filter that kinda reminds me of chowder (the cartoon where characters outfits were the background, and the clothes would change appearance based on where on the screen they were) it looks really bad, and it blurs stuff together (REALLY noticeable on barakas teeth)
-cant change options ingame
-the animations that play when you hover over a character take waaaay longer to start, and are too short and too close to the camera compared to the ones from mkx
-the animations that play after selecting characters are lame compared to the ones in mkx, they used to trash talk eachother a bit then walk offscreen but now one guy appears on screen, hits weapons together a few times, then the other guy does it, then it just kinda starts, lame compared to mkx but still alright
-tutorials describe special move inputs the same regardless of if you have diagnals turned on (for example scorpions spear in the tutorial is back forward 1, but if you have that setting on you actually need to do half circle forward 1)
-ok its really quiet most of the time, then sometimes raiden will use his lightning in a cutscene and itll be 100000 times louder than everything else combined (this is still an issue)
-i really dont like the sweat effect on the in game engine, but its not a big deal
-cutscenes are in an ultrawide aspect ratio
-the setting that changes special inputs to require diagnals doesnt just change quarter circles, it changes the back forward motion to half circle forward and stuff like that, not a huge deal but caused me personally to end up turning it off
-ronda rouseys voice acting. i didnt think it was that bad at first, then i heard her say ""im done entertaining you clowns, get in here you cowards!"" and man did i see the light
-the competetive variations(i will also explain my thoughts on this one)
-dlc/microtransactions/other stuff you can buy is way too expensive. $6 for a character you can unlock for free with just a little more effort? $8 just for an intro???? $40 for just 6 characters? (assuming they keep the $6 each thing youre $4 in the hole for a week early access to the characters and a few costumes and gear, worth it but still sucks)


[h1]thoughts on grind stuff[/h1]

 fuck mk11 fuck netherrealmstudios fuck mortal kombat mortal kombat sucks also fuck injustice (but actually fuck injustice). ok now that you know im not an nrs employee

honestly, i kinda like having a super long/hard grind for getting cosmetics, and i like that theyre random. i like being able to get a cosmetic i like randomly and knowing that not many people have this (at least for the first month or so) and being able to go online and show off what i have that they might not, or to go online and see someone elses skin and think ""man, i really like that skin, im gonna try and get that"". also, i kinda like having the towers be super hard too, it reminds me of this mobile game (i know this sounds bad but trust me) i used to play called shadow fight 2, its a fighting game (ish) that requires you to buy the best gear you can (in game currency) to have any chance at beating the next story guy. if you buy the wrong thing or decide that you want to save up for something else you can do that, but itll be super hard to beat the guy. every level is possible with nothing, but its insanely hard, the next fight might be much easier tho. i think this is what they were going for by making the gear/loot system the way it is


how i would fix grind stuff
-keep it random, but put them in categories (for example skins and titles on the left side, gear in the middle, fatalities brutalities etc on the right)
[strike]-remove icons from loot pool[/strike] impossible :(
-have the modifiers in the towers scale in power based on how prepared you are, it should still be super hard, but doable. doesnt even necessarily have to be fun challenge, just satisfying challenge, like in shadow fight

[h1]thoughts on competitive variations[/h1]

its awful, so many characters are completely gimped by their shitty sets, scorpion doesnt even have one with the misery blade, come on!!!

how i would fix the competitive variations

3 options

1. rotate them every 2 months or something

2. for the first maybe 3 months of the game allow everyone to use any gear in any mode, and have it all unlocked (only for online and training), then when the 3 months are over take the top 2 most used unique sets, modify them a little make sure theyre all thematic and working properly and have a costume and stuff, then make those the variations

3. just make a third for each character (this also applies to options 1 and 2)

51,50443777,english,"I've been playing the Mortal Kombat games ever since picked up Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3, and aside from MK vs. DC, this is the only MK game I cannot recommend.

Pros:
Tutorial- The tutorials are actually pretty good. It breaks down all the basics of frame advantage and special cancelling (which is pretty much a staple for MK at this point)

Gameplay (kinda)- I love the new attack/defense bars, krushing blows, and fatal blows. Compared MK9 and MKX, I definitely prefer these over enhance, breaker, and x-ray bar. However, there is still a few changes I dislike.

Cons:
Gameplay (kinda)- I hate how they took out the ability to run, it feels pretty awkward being only able to dash across the entire screen and between combo-strings. Speaking of combos, compared to MKX, the combos feel extremely lack-luster. Also, the obligatory 30fps on krushing/fatal blows just looks really ugly. 

Variations- Only 2 (tournament legal) variations for each character. Casual players will say ""Just create your own and play for fun"", but this doesn't hold much weight given that the people that play competitively are the demographic that keep other fighting games relevant after a few months. In MKX, variations weren't a huge deal since they were balanced relatively well, but in this game all the variations seem half-assed. I wish they would get rid of variations completely and just give all the characters their full (balanced, of course) move-set.

Kustomization- While I like SOME of the costumes, a lot of them just different color palettes of the same outfit. Augments should have never been a thing in fighting games, dont know why they had to add these in MK. Also, grinding to get a particular outfit/color palette, gear, or augments just feel like a huge waste of time IMO.

Characters- A lot of the characters look really ugly. There are a few that I personally find alright (Lui Kang, Johnny Cage, Kollector, and Cetrion), but majority of the characters look like they received krushing blow with the ugly-stick.

Krypt- This could have been one the best renditions of the krypt throughout the franchise if wasn't for some factors. 80%  of the items you'll get are going to be either augments, consumables, or forge items. To get 100% of the krypt unlocked you're going to have to do A BUNCH of grinding, and even then you'll have to reset the lootboxes *AHEM* I mean chest' to even get the items you want. Also, 30 fps takes away from the immersion of walking around the island. *Side note* Kenshi's blindfold drains Souls, which is incrediblly stupid. 

Other things- AI battles: who actually wants to sit back and watch AI fight other AI. Towers of Time: 90% of the rewards are going to be currency, augments, or konsumables. Also, if you're grinding one group of towers and the time for it expires, you'll be kicked out of it after you're done with the current tower and you wont be able to finish the others, no matter if you had 1 left. Frost DLC: who actually thought charging money for a FREE character was a good idea? whether you buy or not, its still an extremely scummy business practice. It's like charging for bottled water next to a water fountain.

Bonus/Obligatory: While it's not a huge concern, it still plays a part in the current image of NRS. That of course is the sudden change of the female fighters (Yes, I know this has been mentioned countless times). I dont care if they want to dial back the sexuality of the characters, but at least be consistent with this. Don't make majority of the males be shirtless while completely covering the females and claim ""You would wear armor to fight"". You cant just pull a complete 180 on the female's iconic designs that have been used since the first game, while keeping the males untouched. (And no, im not making the point because I allegedly ""Just want to see those thicc anime women in skimpy outfits"". if I  really wanted to see that, i'd go on any explicit website to watch it for free and not pay $60 just to see it in a game. Also, this game is rated M. We can watch people get mutilated in horrific ways, but apparently we can't handle cleavage or booty.)",1556838895,1556838895,False,3,0,0.523299515247344971,0,True,False,False,76561198062205800,68,2,3260,0,2237,1574569916,,
52,50311457,english,"Preface: A lot of the issues with PC have been fixed, and the ones that haven't are still being worked on. The game is in a much better state than it was at launch.

This is a fantastic game, this has the most singleplayer content out of any fighting game ever released, at least to my knowledge. It has a story mode that lasts about 4~5 hours, and has replayability (from what I've heard, I assume some different scenes depending on some actions), it has challenge towers full of silly and cool modifiers, it has AI matches where you can create AI teams to play against other people's AI teams for rewards, and a krypt full of treasure, puzzles, and secrets.

Before I list pros and cons, let me be more than clear. There is no way to spend money to gain an advantage in either singleplayer or multiplayer. You cannot purchase skip fight tokens, you cannot purchase exp boosters, you cannot purchase augments, you cannot purchase consumables. No part of this game's design was ever intended to be ""Predatory"", because there's no way for them to profit off of it. This misinformation needs to stop.

Pros:
-Excellent netcode, I'm legitimately very surprised at how good it is. I was worried about there being no GGPO, but I haven't even felt the slightest bit of input delay.
-Krypt is really fun to explore, however it contains jumpscares... which I am extremely averse to. So be warned.
-Game plays very well, the multiplayer side of things is extremely enjoyable, the krushing blow system adds a lot of depth to gameplay, rewarding spacing and punishes just as much as memorizing and executing long combos. It adds a new layer to conditioning that helps guide players towards that conditioning part of fighting games.
-Very extensive and helpful tutorial, goes through both the basics and more complex nitty gritties of fighting games. Also gives some nice strategy tips overall and for each character.
-New meter system is wonderful, replaces the old super meter system with a stamina system. You start the match with all of your resources and choose when to spend them, rather than waiting to build them up. I have nothing against the old super meter system, it was fine too, but it's nice having a breath of fresh air.
-Music and sound design are fantastic all over, I especially love the music/stings that play during and after fatalities.
-Many options for non-competitive play, with towers, story, ai battles, exploring the krypt, and  even coop boss battles.
-Fatalities and Brutalities. I mean come on.
-NRS seems like a great company, constantly willing to listen and respond to feedback, as shown on multiple occasions.
***-Game looks really good. I preface this with stars because I have to run the game on minimum settings so it looks soso, videos I've seen of the game make it look really good but I actually have not experienced it looking good first hand. That said, I really like the art direction, the style is really appealing imo.

Cons:
-If you play on a standard fight stick with an analogue stick and 8 buttons, you cannot activate consumables in the towers of time. This is not something that will affect everyone, but it affects many, including myself.
-Desyncing issues online. A lot of people, myself included, get desyncs when playing online very consistantly. There are a few measures you can take that might prevent them, but they don't work for everybody. It only happens at the end of matches, but result in losses when playing ranked.
***-Many people also report various technical issues on the PC version, and they are looking into fixing it. I personally haven't experienced any problems whatsoever, I suppose I'm just lucky. Just know that if you purchase the game, you may run into issues and have to contact the devs to let them know where to look to sort things out.
***-FPS inconsistency? I'm not the type of person who really notices this kind of stuff or even if I did I wouldn't care, but other people say that the game downshifts to 30 FPS during fatalities and in the krypt, which is jarring to some. I have no opinion on this, but it's worth mentioning for comprehensiveness.

....Other stuff:
-The controversies surrounding the game are absurd but have to be mentioned as they cannot be ignored. Women are generally completely covered. I would argue that it fits a lot of their personalities. None of the women necessarily came off as strippers, and seeing jade in full armor, scarlet in cult robes, etc. all seem fitting to me. They may not to you.
Jax apparently has an ending to his arcade mode that could be read into in a very political way. I won't say much more than this because I don't know much more than that or care to know more than that. It's, again, absurd but has to be mentioned.
Lastly Shao Khan says ""Make Outworld great again"", or some form of that. This has some people mad, I found it funny and don't care to try to read into any political interpretation. Just an amusing reference to me, but if it makes you mad that's on you.

A note on the story:
I have not played the story, so I cannot personally comment on it. That said, it would feel weird to not include at least some opinion on the story in the review. Some people have liked it, other people do not. This doesn't really tell you much, unfortunately, but just know that the story is not universally liked, so there's a chance you may not like it as well.

This game is really good all-around though, I feel like I could spend hours in the game without getting worn out simply due to the variety of things available. It is one of the best fighting games I've played, a great singleplayer experience, and overall a good direction for MK. If you want to get involved in the supposed politics, be my guest.

59,50357820,english,"Mortal Kombat 11 had the blueprints to be one of my favorite MK games of all time. The gameplay is fantastic, the story is actually great despite some missteps, an indepth tutorial for each character, a krypt that has Shang Tsung Narrating each new area. It had so much potential.....

Alas, all of this is marred by the constant online nature of the game. All of the towers are locked behind online, your currency, your rewards, and even the krypt is locked behind the always online gate.

But wait, there's more...

There's three types of currency, four if you count time stones( I don't count those augment coins as they practically don't exist for me), and they are gold koins, souls, and hearts. The koins aren't so bad but it's the hearts and souls that are killer. In the krypt, there are some chests that cost 100 to 250 hearts. It doesn't sound too bad until you realize that in order for you to get hearts, you need to do fatalities and brutalities. fatalities earn you ONE heart while brutalities earn you TWO hearts! You can get then in chest which will net you 25 but they require RNG and I'll get to that real soon...

(edit: as of now, it's 3-5 hearts. marginally better but still flawed.)

But wait, there's more....

Remember those soul stones? each soul stone chest needs 100 to unlock. However, you'll need to farm fights which only get you 10 per victory or hope that a chest has them for 25-100 but that also depends on RNG...oh, and some areas require you to pay soul currency to pass. repairing the pit area costs 2000 souls and getting once chest from the dead woods require 3000......


But wait, there's more...


Remember when i said that getting those two currencies would require RNG?apparently, the chest locations are randomly generated. there's no fixed location for the stuff you want unless it's in a soul or heart chest, making finding the stuff you want tedious unless you are into that sort of thing.

I'd recommend this game to both old and new fighting game fans alike, especially people who like myself have struggled with Mortal Kombat games in the past. The combo structure in this game is far more lenient (though some are still very difficult to pull off).

The game's sound design is great, it's the best looking fighting game currently on the market, runs well for the most part, and has the best character design in Mortal Kombat history.

The only microtransactions in the game are Time Crystals, which you can only spend on a randomized set of 5 items which refreshes every 24 hours. These items can be unlocked through the rest of the game as well, and you can get Time Crystals from just playing the game. Otherwise, Time Crystals have no purpose.

The way unlocks work is still not ideal and you can expect to spend a lot of time if you want to unlock everything for your character alone, as drops from the Krypt are still entirely randomized.

71,50435399,english,"Now that the ToT/Krypt/Currencies have been addressed I can properly review this game. For the best experience use the 60fps mod tool by Endri. This game looks marvelous with it!

Story:

I absolutely loved the story in this game from start to finish. The cinematics were awesome and the transitions between cutscenes and gameplay are like butter. Sound is crisp and the entire story feels like watching a movie. If you are contemplating buying this game just for the story I would definitely consider it an option but probably not at full retail. I was able to complete the story within about 6 hours.

Towers of Time:

Since the patch the ToT are much more manageable and the payout is much better! (1,000 koins per match, up to 8 hearts per match) If I have a hard time beating a fight then I will enable the AI fighter. Overall the payout is fun in ToT and it is definitely still challenging as it should be (I was unable to beat the scorpion tower).

Krypt: 

NOTE
I'm still not impressed that the krypt is 30fps. While the 60fps mod helps the krypt is very unoptimized so you are unable to get steady 60fps (usually hovered between 40-60). 

Gameplay aside the krypt is huge and full of mysteries and challenges, most of what still wait for me the next time I play it. There is so much to do in here I feel like I will be spending a lot of time figuring out how to unlock rewards and opening chests. I like the direction that NRS went and I think they got the krypt right this time around. I also like the 3rd person view compared to 1st person.

Multiplayer: (Que ""DESYNC"" Audio!)

The majority of my time spent playing online has been playing kasual 1v1 matches, so I can't apply my review to every aspect. However, from what I have played, the netcode is the BEST it has ever been in Mortal Kombat. With excellent connection to your peer it almost feels like you are playing on the couch next to them. Very impressed with how everything plays this time around. Your mileage will vary depending on how strong your connection is. I have had a few match dropouts. There is an issue online currently with ""desyncs."" Basically at the end of some matches the game will ""desync"" when player 1 wins. This could be caused by in-game RGB issues that were implemented. People aren't happy with this but for me it isn't gamebreaking--still worth mentioning.

Kharacter Kustomization:

There's so many kustomization pieces in this game it is ridiculous. Plenty of things to unlock that will keep you playing the game forever. Skins and gear pieces for every character, banners, brutalities, fatalities, and much more. The kustomization functionality in this game is implemented very well and is satisfying. You can swap out abilities for any kharacter so you can have them setup however you want.

Side Notes:

Local play is good as always. If you are new to the game there is a VERY in-depth tutorial mode that will help you get familiar with the game. This has helped me understand frame data, krushing blows, fatal blows, breakaways, and many other new mechanics in this game. Mortal Kombat 11 plays different than MKX; its much slower and more strategic. I love this aspect because you won't always get rushed down in game like in previous titles.

Conclusion:

Overall MK11 is such an amazing game and I recommend it for anyone who is unsure of buying the PC version.

The bosses of each tower are now possible to beat, they've increased the rewards per fight, and gave out a gift to all players to make up for the issues. I'm glad they're addressing the problems, it makes me that much more confident that they'll kontinue to balance and tweak for the better.

(Old review below)
The towers are nigh impossible in this game... i would wait for a patch if there ever is one. The towers are important to the experience because its one of the very few ways you can get the many currencies needed to unlock various unlocks from the krypt. It can take you over an hour just to complete one tower due to the sheer difficulty and thats WITH the items that give you an ""Upper edge"" activated. To put it into perspective, the average chest to unlock in the crypt is around 10,000 gold. The second tower in a series can give you about 7500 gold.... and it can take an hour to beat it... something isn't right here.
That being said, the story is interesting and is a direct sequel to mkx. So there's that. Oh and the online is pretty good. Stable matches and at the moment a pretty even spread of skill levels as far as the player base is concerned.",1556541378,1556808411,True,0,0,0.509992480278015137,0,True,False,False,76561198044000120,120,4,5770,0,1062,1558372083,,
75,50435109,english,"As a huge fan of the past Mortal Kombat games, I was hyped to finally get my hands on Mortal Kombat 11. And in my opinion, it did not disappoint. With gorgeous graphics and new creative designs for the characters, it already had me hooked. But of course cool graphics don't make a good game. So let's take a closer look.

Having played both MK9 and MKX, I immediately noticed that the performance has improved by far. I haven't changed platform since but every fight and every cut scene seem incredibly fluid. I haven't even had to adjust the settings because the game did that all by itself. Which brings me to the next step. The settings of the game are very detailed and there are many ways to adjust them to the the liking of each individual player.
But enough of the technical part. The game also brings some new variations to the fights. As, for example the fatal blow, which kind of replaces the x-ray, but is only available once per match when your HP is low. I don't want to list every change they've made, but mechanics like this give the game a more balanced feeling and make it possible to come out of a critical situation. Besides that, many of the known characters got some new moves and styles and of course there are many new (very creative) finishers.
The character customization also had some major changes. Besides skins, details like weapons and masks can now be changed as well. Things like that and character concepts can be found in the krypt. A loot wonderland. But unlike before you now move through the krypt as an actual character with whom you can interact more directly. The only problem of this game so far is that you have to farm way too long to gain a reasonable amount of loot and the mode that gives most of the money is a little too hard for a casual player. However, just a few days after release, the developers announced that they are aware of the problem and that there will be changes.
Last on my list is the story mode, which I enjoyed really much. It is not very long, but very well made and it also gives the opportunity to get the hang of the game. Like always with Mortal Kombat the humorous story left me completely brainf...ed, thinking what the hell have I just witnessed and I loved every second of it.

So the only thing left to say is, if you like a good beat em up that doesn't take itself too seriously, I fully recommend this game! Now go finish them!",1556807822,1556807822,True,12,6,0.593318343162536621,0,True,False,False,76561198075585357,466,7,1950,0,1386,1593011642,,

Only to then learn that it's true only for the male characters, because the females will never be getting their ""klassic"" oufits cause the art director considers them politically incorrect.
Mind you, this does not mean that the default skins will be censored (a big portion of the female skins litterally wears hijabs now) - the ""old skool"" skins are not even available for unlocking, regardless of the amount of grind.

And this coming from Mortal Kombat - the franchise that wouldn't budge in its controversial style and tone for 27 years, even in the face attacks from US congress and other governments, allowing it to maintain a loyal fanbase.

Gameplay-wise I also prefer MKXL, as the fights are now slower and fatalities easier. Also, this may be just an impression - but it does feel like the portfolio and diversity of character moves is smaller than before.

I do not recommend this installmet of the series, for the step in a dangerous direction of toning-down Mortal Kombat - which we've come to enjoy exactly for it's over-the-top, controversial ridculousness.

I for one, definitely won't be buying the next one, if they decide to fall even deeper in the direction of infesting the franchise with politics.

The execution of every combo is fluid, the mechanics are fun and new improvements like the Fatal Blow system and the stamina meters lead to strategic moments and decisions more often.

Every character is highly distinguishable from one another and their special moves feel better than ever.

The stages are also a big plus of the game and I was pleasured to see each one being used during the storyline, which is an even bigger pleasure to look at, due to its gorgeous cutscenes and seemless switch between gameplay and said cutscenes.

The Krypt may be a weird concept but is beautiful and a joy for every fan of the classic mortal kombat franchise.

I have witnessed a lot of hate towards the Towers of Time, NRS however has already adressed this problem and I never really felt frustrated if I failed, so that the use of ""Konsumables"" was never crucial to succeed.

You have to literally pause the game and wait for the video to catch up with the sound otherwise it looks like the Kung Pao movie only worse.. I know that my graphics card is way up to the task as when i play any other mode it runs without a skip. There are also alot of crashes if you run third party things like razer or other programs like that.. The grind I will say I do enjoy.. I think a lot of people complain about it because they just want to jump online and play others without having to do this but for me it makes it a lot more enjoyable..

(UPDATE) Their new patch they made has made the game worse..  It crashes right when it loads into the game with all the disclaimers and such.. The game crashes now ever 5 minutes..

The game is great but the all these problems it is virtually unplayable.  How can they charge this kind of money for a game that crashes every few seconds. has desynching in story mode???

20,50291812,english,"After having played this game for around 40 hours here's what I have to say.

Pros:
- Tutorial system is excellent. It provides detailed, structured explanations to bring you up to a decent level.

- Graphics are fantastic although the anti-aliasing could be improved but is fine for the most part! 

- Game-play is phenomenal, the flow of combat is extremely satisfying and smooth way better then MK-X.

- Fatalities are insane, the best in the series hands down!

- Sound design is excellent, punches and kicks sound satisfying alongside all the other weapons. Music could be a bit better however you rarely even focus in on it in the heat of combat so it's not such a big deal.

- Challenge towers. After the terrible and frustrating state these towers were in at launch I am pleased to say they are now doable and are actually quite a bit of fun. The rewards are varied with each tower and so you can take on the challenge to unlock gear, intros, brutalities, stones and player icons for your characters. You can also team up with other people online to take on a ""Boss"" type battle similar to tag team in MK9.

Cons:

- Varied framerates. 30 FPS in the Main Menu, Fatalities, Fatal Blows and Kritical Strikes and Krypt whereas the rest of the game runs at 60 FPS. This can sometimes be a bit jarring however I, for the most part, don't even notice it and in my opinion it does not detract from the flow of the game.

- Krypt: An excellent premise however the randomisation of loot and extremely expensive chests (13,000 for anything half decent) makes it so that you rarely get anything you want, with most of the rewards being items for the forge and challenge tower consumables rather than costumes and gear. Another thing to point out is that some items in the Krypt require currencies to use, mainly Kenshi's headband that requires orbs (which are used for crafting in the Krypt and are rather scarce to begin with) and eats them up at a rate of roughly 2 per second which is absolutely absurd! You get a large sum of Koins to begin with however once they're gone, and they go quickly mind you as everything is so expensive!, You can gain a fair amount of Koins and Hearts in a short amount of time however YOU HAVE TO SPEND KOINS TO RESTOCK THE CHESTS IN THE KRYPT!!! as once you've opened them they don't refresh! Meaning you have to spend even more time grinding for Koins which you won't get rewards from!

- Kustomisation: An absolute tragedy of a system, apparently borrowed from Injustice 2 (although I have never played it so cannot confirm) this system makes it so that you have to level up the gear that you wear in order to slot in stones that modify your characters stats in some way, be it bonus damage with a certain move or resistance to certain types of damage. Doesn't sound too bad right? WRONG! You have to level up EACH PIECE OF GEAR, so if you equip a new helmet you're back to square ONE!!! Also guess where all the gear/stones and skins are unlocked? That's right! the Krypt, so you have to spend HOURS grinding for Koins in order to even have a CHANCE at getting a piece of gear you want. Also you have to have the correct stone for the correct slot in that gear making the chances of having a matching set of stones for your gear EVEN SMALLER!!!

- Story. A crippling issue of audio video de-sync has ruined all enjoyment of the story. 
I'd like to note that changing the in-game setting all to their lowest settings HAD NO EFFECT!!. Such as shame as what I did get to experience was brilliant! 

UPDATE: A workaround is to pause the game, wait 5 seconds and then resume however while this does work be ready to keep pausing every 10 seconds as the game will quickly de-sync itself again.

Note: I have not had any connections issues or random crashes that other people have experienced however that's not to say these issues do not occur.

As a final verdict, which i hope will change in the future, I would still NOT recommend that you purchase this game and it absolutely pains me to say that. But it's clear this game has MAJOR issues. Even after two patches which shouldn't have been needed in the first place (it's like they didn't even play-test their own game!)  issues are still present, the story de-sync being a hard hitter, the RNG Krypt system alongside the awful gear level up system and augments are still major gripes which is a shame as the amount of customisation is great, just don't expect to get the gear or skins you want anytime soon, unless of course they pop up in the store in which case you can purchase it with micro-transactions! 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Just to clarify a few points made in the comments:

My Computers specifications (or at least the most important ones):

i5-7600k OC to 4.5Ghz
Nvidia GTX 970
16GB DDR4 RAM

I can run the game at stable 60fps with High/Very High settings.

@barkythekat about entitlement:

No, this is not what this is about. If you spend ¬£50 on a game, which mind you is a lot of money for a game, you expect to be able to unlock and have access to all the content in the game in a reasonable manner since you have indeed paid for it. If you have to then spend even more money on top of what you paid initially for the game to access over 50% of the games content, then something is terribly wrong.

@MADMAN:

I have over 300 games in my steam account, most of which I picked up at launch. I have only written 4 reviews, 2 of which are public. Why? well, most of those games were great at launch! and so I had no need to vent my frustrations! Also, my review is my opinion you may not agree with it but just shrugging it off and saying that I ""just love to complain"" is a pretty weak rebuttal of the points I have made.

@arracatinga:

I saw an interview with Ed Boon where he said they would be at 30fps, I understand they are ""meant"" to be at 30. However, his reasoning was that in order to do slow motion the frame-rate has to be halved as the mechanics are tied to the frame-rate of the game. (i.e 60fps full speed 30fps half speed) I dont have complete knowledge of the workings of the game so that may not be the full answer. I also said in my review that the fatalities and other x-ray type scenes do not detract from the flow of the game. The menus and Krpyt however, should be at 60 and I can't think of a reason for them to be at 30.

@Jan: about ""inflation"" and necessity of micro-transactions.

That is absurd!! you think these multi billion dollar publishers need micro-transactions to help with development costs! 

The exact development cost of MKX, MK9 and MK11 by Netherrealm (a subsidiary of Warner Bros) is hard to find. However if we assume MK 11's to be in the range of $100M USD and your claim is that these systems are in place to help fund against rising development costs due to inflation. 

Well, Warner Bros' total revenue in 2016 was $13.04 Billion!! Granted, not all of that would go to Netherrealm, however they clearly have more than enough to support MK11 over its lifespan.

To put that into perspective. CD Projekt Red who made the Witcher 3 spent $81 Million on its development and brought in 463.1M PLN (roughly $120Million) in terms of revenue in 2017 a far lesser amount than Warner Bros. Do you see them using micro-transactions or other systems in their games to help fund the development of Cyberpunk2077 or other titles they may be working on? 

No, you don't. That's because if you make a good game, more copies will sell and you will get more money. Warner Bros have added this micro-transaction system not because they are short of money but because they want MORE money and this has to STOP.

25,50290475,english,"I am having a great time with this game so far and don't understand any of the hate its getting.

First I will address the negative reviews for the game and the complaints before talking about why I like it.
The complaints of micro transactions in the game are a joke, every item you can get with VC in this game can also be bought with the games in game free currency (Koins). On top of that all the things you spend your VC on get you nothing but cosmetic items and items that only effect gameplay when playing Towers.

The day one fighter DLC that people are complaining about is also able to be unlocked just by finishing the games story mode.

Every complaint about the way the game looks and runs are redundant as well considering that I had these same issues, so I went to GeForce Experience and low and behold there was a DRIVER UPDATE AVAILABLE! SERIOUSLY STOP COMPLAINING ABOUT HOW THE GAME RUNS AND UPDATE YOUR FUCKING DRIVERS IT FIXED EVERYTHING!

OK! Now, onto why I like the game,
Cosmetic customization of your fighters is fresh and is more than just a whole new skin with 2 palates now, it is way more in depth and allows you to create a whole new and unique look to your fighters.

The Krypt is a fun experience on its own, its all in the 3rd person and you get to explore Shang Tsung's island while also unlocking cool cosmetics and concept arts just like the Krypt from MK9 but better!

The new fighting systems and speed of the game is a literal game changer and is fresh in every way. The new way X-Ray attacks are executed to the final blow mechanic is all fresh and new feeling.

There is a new training mode to teach you the basics of the game if you are new to MK and it even goes way more in depth and teaches you about more of the game mechanics that would normally go amiss by newcomers to the fighting genre.

I have yet to play the story but I will come back to finish this review after I do.

Currently I give it a solid 8/10.

EDIT: You don't even need to finish the story to unlock Frost you just have to beat her like you're Chris Brown during the Sub-Zero/Scorpion part of the story.

EDIT 2: I have finished the story and found it very enjoyable and kept me interested throughout it. There were times where I had to do other things but I didn't want to quit playing the game because I was so invested in the story.

26,50287006,english,"This started off as a bad review because the graphics were so bad during launch, I couldn't even play. As well as having issues with the game even booting up. And of course the Towers of Time. Now that those two issues are mostly resolved, I can actually experience the game.

GRAPHICS - MK11 looks a lot better than MKX with using the Unreal Engine 4 this time around. Overall, the game looks really good. Everything loads very quickly including navigating through the main menu which gives the game a smooth feel. The game play graphics are crisp and smooth. The issues I do have with the graphics are: capping fps at 30 during fatalities and fatal blows. And reducing their quality at the same time. It's 2019. we all can do much better than 30 fps. Not sure what that's all about.

SOUND - Wow! Just wow! These guys earned every dollar they made, if not more. The sound of chains, of Scorpion's hellfire when he enters a fight. Every spatter of blood. Good lord these guys are good!

STORY LINE - I'm about half way through the story and it's been pretty good so far. The dialog between new and old Johnny Cage is freaking hilarious! The call back to the old Mortal Kombat is fun. I won't spoil anything but when ""someone"" dies, it's supposed to be intense and sad. All I could think was ""Good riddance. I won't miss you"". Chronica is a very interesting character. Although, I think just adding another boss and saying ""she's been pulling the strings all along"", is a bit of a cop out. 

GAME PLAY - The fighting itself is fun. Each character has a ton of moves and customization. Some of the characters moves are almost completely useless though. It's almost like they ran out of ideas so there's a few filler moves. The fatalities are so good!

PROGRESSION - Omg.. where to start. Yuck.. Oh man.. Ok. The progression is complete shit. It is so damn grindy. There are way too many currencies. And you earn so little at a time. When you finally have enough to spend a bit in the Krypt. You mostly open uninteresting and unrewarding items. I've opened 10 chests in a row and get crap like crafting materials, kards, consumables, recipes and more and more utter garbage. It's more like a landfill than a Krypt. Occasionally you'll get something cool like a fatality or a good skin. But the chances are incredibly slim. Speaking of skins. There are tons of skins. But the vast majority are recolors of other skins. And most of the recolors are not even good. And some others are downright ugly! And then they throw in the microtransactions. In a $60 AAA game. Now that's not always a bad thing. If a company makes a finished games and then wants to make extra content for it for a small price, I think that's totally fine. Like additional characters or possibly skins if done right. But putting what should be in the game in the first place behind a grind wall that you either spend tons of time on or empty your pockets is so distasteful and gross.

What i am currently having a problem with is the message thats pops up somewhat randomly to tell me that my game has desynced and this only happens when i get to a fatality screen whether i won or lost and its as if it never happened. i probably have another 100 games ive played that should be in my stats but arnt because of this error.

Don't let my thumbnail fool you, Mortal Kombat 11 is a good game. Especially now that we know NetherRealm is going to be continuously updating the game. While the grind is a complete slap to the genitalia, I do feel like we have a voice in the continuous development of MK11.

Anyway I'll give just a brief summary of my video review. 

 MK11 is a fantastic entry into the history of the franchise. Plenty of easter eggs as well as smooth gameplay mixes this game to have a great feeling when playing. Of course the design of MK11 is superb. Fatalities, character themes, and overall graphics/voice acting is amazing. The story is a bit cliche and has quite a bit of missed opportunities, and we get the timey whimy fun stuff that surely hasn't been worn out yet right?

Gear and customization is fun, and brings in the best of Injustice 2.  Getting gear, however, is significantly more grindy than we've ever had to deal with. The most common description I've heard for it is ""Mobile Game like Grind"". Really it is pretty hard to disagree with that statement too. Still tho, it never stalled my enjoyment when I was playing my favorite characters. 

The hits you'll deal out have plenty of weight behind them, and the super moves are toasty af. Combos are fun to experiment with, and the move set variations add alot of fun into the series. While similar to MKX, the move set variations aren't locked down into one preset like before.

A week after launch, PC was finally patched to functionality. And with it, I'm changing my review to a positive one.

Whatever plans for MTX there were, they've been backtracked. You can unlock basically everything by just playing the game. The grind has been adjusted to be far more manageable (1000 koins per win, several hearts per fatality/brutality, Towers of Time toned *way* down), PC now has the same combos as console does and I can truly say I genuinely enjoy playing this game now.

What little issues remain (30 fps lock in cutscenes/krypt/menus, anti-aliasing is bad and lighting issues in Krypt) are so minor I find it hard to bitch about them.

64,50306448,english,"So. First things first. The gameplay of MK 11 feels like a twosteps forward one step back from MK 10. combo's feel easier overall, though most require that you enhance a special move to not end the string after a single hit string to special, which is... alright i guess.

My big gripe, as is many reviewers, is the micro transactions. for a full price game on release to attempt to extract more money through a randomized lootbox system and in game consumables is extremely disheartening. The fact that on release the main way to get customization pieces (the Towers of Time) are not dictated entirely by player skill, but by having the correct immunity consumable causes those of us with less than legendary abillity at the game to want to drop the game entirely.

Ending statement: The game is good, but the monetization practice of Nether Realm Studios/ Warner Bros. should be criticized much in the same way that EA's Starwars Battlefield was. It is unnacceptable and appalling.

4/30 Update: NRS, if you bother looking at reviews, I hope that more reviewers than I let you know that 3 hearts per fatality is still not a good reward if you need 250 hearts per chest, you need to do 87 fatals per chest. Kind of absurd don't you think? in addition, the towers of time gimmicks still suck. You've put two patches through and it is still absolute agony to attempt to make it through a single tower island in my daily play time.

68,50311216,english,"4/30/19 update:
Today's patch put the game on parity with PS4. There's a 60fps mod out there for PC which ‚Äî if they don't start banning people for using it ‚Äî makes PC the best version of the game currently. 

Even with big improvements to the core grind loop the towers of time are not fun and playing online will give you much worse rewards. That the ""day one"" patch took a week to release on PC and that we were denied the beta access and midnight release everyone else enjoyed shows our community is still an afterthought for NRS. For those reasons I'm still hesitant to recommend the game.


Original review:
It hurts to say, but this isn't ready yet. 

There are several serious performance issues on PC, notably crashing during practice and customization, low volume, an eye-bleeding 30 fps cap in the krypt, cutscenes, and fatal blows/fatalities, and 60 fps otherwise.
Between all that and the horrible design of the towers/krypt progression there's a lot holding back an otherwise great game. NRS say they're scrambling to adjust this but for now it's all talk. They released a $60 fighter with fundamental performance failures and a grind so bad it makes mobile games look gratifying; that gives a bad image of where their heads are at.

If you're not too thirsty for MK11 you should wait a bit for patches or even the ""XL"" version, but all things considered I'm not optimistic that we'll get fixes for all of the games' problems even a year from now. Some issues like the FPS caps are probably here to stay.",1556168111,1556665245,False,5,0,0.53947371244430542,0,True,False,False,76561197988766638,270,19,12794,0,834,1558029018,,

------ OLD REVIEW B4 PATCH-----

Warning!!
NRS have made a good game but the way they've done everything to be monetized on grinding is fucked up.
There is thousands of things to unlock which i dont mind, i would've grinded the shit out of this game.

The problem for me is the constant server disconnects, happens everywhere, in fights, in menu, watching cutscene, in crypt.

Tower of time is supposed to be hard, as it s one of the main progress and unlocking systems in the game.
the difficulty is the AI getting better and wrecking you, there is also modifiers that work against you and you have to counter with consumables(monetization scheme). I accept Modifiers, they add stupid shit to the maches what is really fucked though is how the AI gets bonuses not related to modifiers.

Example, first tower after tutorials: If Smoke hits you the screen turns dark, leaving you open for more attacks, and this AI is already super good and lands combos 100% of the time

Another example: on the secnond tower cassie cage actrivates a magnetic field which sucks you towards her leaving no room for zoning, just in-the-face mashing. I spent 30min and finally defeated her to get DCed from servers and losing all progress.

I've asked for a refund.",1556059595,1556655468,True,0,0,0.474452555179595947,0,True,False,False,76561197984760269,988,40,5685,0,228,1558202219,,

3,50323624,english,"This game has an incredible story, I absolutely loved it, it has some really nice nods to the old MK Shaolin Monks game not only in scenery but in certain parts in the story you are able to choose between two different characters such as Liu Kang/Kung Lao and Sub-Zero/Scorpion. The ending is incredible and unexpected.
        The game looks amazing as well. The new cosmetic system is an awesome addition there are tons of new masks, weapons, bracers etc. you can unlock for each character. 
        The Krypt has an interesting change, it has a more puzzle focused gameplay apposed to going grave to grave in a bland graveyard, you start in one corridor and must use weapons, items and keys to traverse Shang Tsung's island as you explore and collect them, this Krypt has chests instead of graves and it is similar to other MK games where the better items are in the more expensive chests, some people don't like how the loot is random (you cant go to a specific chest to locate a specific item) but it reminds me of MK Deception back in the day (before i used the internet), where i would scroll through buying the most expensive ones until i unlocked something i liked then played some more until i return. 
---Spoilers---
    The hearts for red chests in this are a GRIND but NRS say they will rebalance them, currently you start with 200 they are earned by doing fatality's or brutality's 1/2 respectively, also you can get them by spear throwing hung humans in the Krypt you get 1-2 rng, and they cost 250 to open, so far i have found 10+ red chests, opening a red chest will guarantee you elder to ledgendary skins aswell as a few items and buffs for towers of time.
    The souls are just as much if not more of a grind, to obtain them you have to simply win matches however each tomb/body will cost you 100 souls and there are a LOT of them as well as one bridge tome that costs 2k and a river tome that costs 3k however the items are substantially better than chests.
        I have heard people complain about the microtransactions but to be honest you earn it in-game quite easily (200 for completing the story on normal) and with it you can buy specific skins you may want for specific characters, it isn't pay to win and isn't pay-walling any content it is just a faster way of obtaining in game items that can be unlocked other ways and like i said is earnable by just playing the game, some people are soap boxing over it but for me personally it isn't a problem.

Apr.27th
Recently discovered you have the option of using AI fighters in the towers of time, i like this option as it allows me to obtain the gear id like regardless of my skill and i personally like playing the klassic towers more anyway, the towers of time difficulty would force me to be tournament level good or just use the Ai until the patch rolls out i find this a decent solution.

Apr.30th
The Dev.s updated the system and everything is much easier to obtain now not only was the difficulty toned down but it isn't nearly as much of a grind, fatalities and brutalities provide 3-5 hearts respectivly challenge rounds that rewarded 100 per challenge now provide 1k per challenge, souls per win upgraded from 10 to 20 and they included a package for players including (500,000 koins, 1000 souls, 500 hearts, and 1000 time chrystals) I'm sure they will continue to tweak settings to better suit their vision of the game as it progresses, one thing i love about NRS is they will quickly fix problems outlined by their communities.
9.5/10

I will update as i continue further with the game.



        Why i removed the half point. I read the comics NRS put out for 10 and enjoyed them, I assumed they would be canon but in this game they proved they where not, Divora betrays Kotal Kahn in the first instance of seeing her, in the comics however she stresses how Kotal was the only leader she ever respected, also the Cyber Lin Kuei where destroyed by Sub-Zero with a usb in the comics with the help of Bo Rai Cho and Cyrax, Cyrax kills himself so all the cybers die and so Sub-Zero could restart the Lin Kuei as humans once again, in this however it is Sub-Zero/Scorpion and Cyrax, Cyrax does live in the game tho.",1556230455,1556652622,True,0,0,0.47413790225982666,0,True,False,False,76561198249101926,72,20,4100,0,530,1593040071,,

6,50323687,english,"Gameplay is amazing and graphics are great thats about it.

The towers of time - only way to earn a reasonable amount of koins - is such a fucking dumb bullshit feature. Apparently WB or NRS thought that adding consumables to a fighting game is a fun mechanic, and I suppose it can be argued for. These consumables are implemented to counter the various modifiers that the towers implement. However, unlike in Mortal Kombat X, these modifiers only work AGAINST THE PLAYER. Now, this wouldn't be so bad if most of them are blockable, which they aren't. You could always use a consumable to counter the modifier's effects, but again, if you dont have that consumable then you dont win the fight.

Now, I suppose the modifiers that only work against the player wouldn't be so bad since there are the consumables and lets say you do have the right consumable. THE AI GETS 2-3x MORE FUCKING HEALTH THAN YOU. So you can whale on the enemy down to 1/3 or 1/2 hp, they will still have as much or more fucking hp than you, and slip up just once or twice and that round is now unwinnable.

They stated on the Kombat Kast that they have since turned down the amount of health AI fighters get, however I have not noticed it. It obviously doesn't belong to begin with.

The koins that you get from the Towers of Time - only way to earn a reasonable amount of koins - are spent in the krypt. The krypt is massive and according to the Kombat Kast, There are approximately SIX FUCKING HUNDRED CHESTS THAT COST BETWEEN 2000-15000 COINS. Furthermore, these chests ARE RANDOMLY SCATTERED, SO YOU CAN NO LONGER JUST GO GET THE SHIT YOU WANT. Now, how many koins can you get by completing an average tower of time? Maybe 10,000-20,000 tops. So after fighting 5 or so bullshit AI enemies you now have the privilege of opening one or two good chests, or several ones with trash loot.

Fantastic gameplay, can't reccommend the game in its current state.

10,50407702,english,"As a long time fan of fighting games ranging anywhere from the original Dragon Ball Budokai Series on PS2 to Smash Melee to Injustice 1 or to even Dragon Ball FighterZ, I can officially say that Mortal Kombat 11 is a perfect successor to Mortal Kombat X(XL). Why? It's simple. 
Pros:
The gameplay is probably the best in the series and the neutral game is probably one of the best I've ever experienced. The problem with a lot of fighting games is that you will play through the story and go online and immediately be shown that you do not know how to enter a fight or get a ""First Hit"" on your opponent. This game helps you learn how to deal with your neutrals and the tutorial is so amazing. Probably by far one of my most favorite tutorials in any video game including Smash Ultimate's training room. The core gameplay that makes a Mortal Kombat game is by far the greatest in the series and it's completely watchable from a spectator's POV. The Story also is neat and very interesting since Time Travel is a factor in it.
Cons:
The Towers of Time and Kurrency is a huge issue with this game. As of right now the PS4 version is fixed and personally trying it is much better than before the patch. PS4 is what is should have been and I can agree that it really turned a lot of people away from the game. They should have waited a few more weeks to include this fix so that it wouldn't even be an issue. And the Krypt is fun! By all means it is a great feature and it is literally another game essentially for all Kollectors and this would be on the Pros list but since the Kurrency is screwed up AS OF RIGHT NOW I have to put it here. Plus it's so fun to see all kinds of Easter Eggs in the Krypt.

Final Verdict:
So is this a game for hardcore fans of Mortal Kombat? Yes. Is this a game for competitive players? HELL YES. Is this for a casual player? Kinda of. Just really depends if you want to play just the story, Klassic Towers, and play with your friends. Either way I give this 8/10 AS OF RIGHT NOW and probably will be a 9/10 after the patch.",1556649852,1556649852,True,2,0,0.499112695455551147,0,True,False,False,76561198018668445,274,12,718,0,100,1566421624,,

13,50305928,english,"Update after balance patch released on pc with all those ""gift"" packages. Basically fuck this game. Thanks wb and netherealms for saving me 120$ on injustice 3. I'll play it on youtube and will not spend a single dollar on this. Design of literally the only thing I play in here - towers / multiverse - became abysmal and unblockables from some shitty npc assists which takes away over half of your hp... yeah, fuck this game.

So there was a patch. In general performance, hairs and crashes seems to be ok (at least for my rig), but now after taking some deeper dive into mechanics there is one more thing which is poorly made in this game. I came to this game from Injustice 1 and 2 without giving any damn about PvP. I just want to pick some cool character and play as that character, unlocking loot, skins and all that. No bombs given to pvp.

What I extremely hate in this game - balance in towers. Crypt, all those chests - that's fine. Injustice 2 has loot boxes so crypt is not such shocking concept for me. In fact I prefer fighting games to have something like that to keep my interest in the game. MK doesn't have Batman so after story all those unlocks pretty much only thing which make me come back.

What I extremely hate in towers:
- Looks like balance patch for towers was released, but there is jack shit changes. You still frequently fight enemies which can take half of your health with one strike and u barely scratch them with your x-ray attack. Devs need to dial down on enemies health in those towers... this is really ridicilous. Make more space for towers and make left side of screen with those shitty towers and right side of screen with normally balanced towers. For crying out loud...
- Extremely frequent 2 v 1 fights. And I'm that 1. Enemy can summon some other enemy for them to unleash combo. However while u're being hit by that combo - main enemy can come in and begin doing their combo. So you're being double comboed. Beyond stupid imo.
- Some unblockable effects / some really shitty and annoying effects which can stop your combos mid way. Devs, you'll not make me go into toxic pvp area. No. If anything by placing those modifiers in the game make me think that I'll just ""play"" Injustice 3 on youtube and be done with it.

Also for the love of everything that is holy - make women beautiful in the game again. You now have half naked males running around, but women are fully clothed and tbh really need those masks (especially Kitana). 

Also level of violence is meh.

What is good in the game
- When it's normal balance for enemy in terms of hp and little to no shitty modifier - fight is enjoyable
- Extreme amount of stuff to unlock
- Massive crypt with puzzles, traders, crafting and many other things.
- Atm it seems that Boon was right - you can get all stuff in the game through gameplay. It can be shitty gameplay, but still. All skins displayed in store (at least so far) always have description where to find them through gameplay.

Because there was performance patch I'd say give this game a try on steam (you have those 2 hours before refund still), but I can't fully recommend game to those who came here from injustice series and is just here for pve.

Story = 8.5-9/10 = SOLID
Fighting mechanics = 8.5-9/10 = SOLID
Fatalities/brutalities = same scores = SOLID
Graphics and Sound = Solid/high-quality, you won't complain here either
Tutorial = 9/10 but can be extremely challenging at some points, but it's a tutorial that actually teaches you the game not just shows you how to play the basic, extremely useful and a gamechanger for new players

Enjoyment of all the above = excellent!

Things that MIGHT bother you 
- Limited FPS 30 for Krypt, 60 FPS on gameplay (I have a pretty high-end computer though)
- Krypt (the place you get all your collectibles and cash in your currency) 
- Microtransactions - buying stuff or attaining the currency and the fact that obtaining some items is randomized
- Some characters already feel extremely strong, much stronger than others, example - Noob Saibot

Things that WILL piss you off
- Towers of time - WIDELY varying difficulty, sometimes it's easy other times it's super difficult if not impossible
- MMOFP type mechanics (against AI)- adding trinkets, buffs, things like that in which you will NEED to use in fights to make it either possible to win or progress, they are one-time use and many of them feel not great or useful than others
- Superbuffs to AI - You will get your ass kicked, there are crazy things like buffs that the AI can kill you in just two hits, or can chain so many attacks together and use magic or buffs that leave you stuck in a chain, there are even things that black out your screen or move the screen as a way to add difficulty, it's extremely frustrating and just destroys the experience

These points will be fixed/updated, you are still getting a solid combat game. I'm not sure exactly what people expected but I think once they fix the bottom 3 issues it's going to make a lot difference, but as of now it can be excruciatingly frustrating and a time-sink that's just not rewarding or fun.

Bonus: If you are a mortal kombat fan from years ago they added a lot of old costumes, it's very cool

Great fighting game, but it isn't the best game in the world and has it's issues, it's not perfection or flawless at the time but I think it does the job well, just do yourself a favor and avoid the towers of time for the time being, you might break something.

34,50400455,english,"Terrible game with a terrible PC port(again).

Cons:
- Slow gameplay(compared to MKX) which becomes even slower with ""Krushing Blows"" and ""Fatal Blows"".
- KBs and especially FBs ruin the flow of the game and become annoying after one match.
- New meter refills by itself - you don't have to attack/use special moves -> no meter management. FBs use no meter.
- Little to no variety in combos - you learn a string or two and do the same thing over and over again.
- PC version is behind by several patches compared to the console version.
- Ugly, bland design when it comes to characters. Some are ugly by themselves(Kitana, Sonya), some become even more horrid with their terrible costumes/skins(Skarlet, Sub-Zero).
- Mediocre roster with forgettable newcomers and questionable picks like Skarlet(an atrocity), Kabal, Jacqui, Cassie along with her toxic —Åunt mother, Frost(bleh). Cetrion is an irredeemable character from Injustice who has no place in MK.
- Ridiculous story mode with time travel(again) that basically resets the game(again!). Overall it reeks of capesh1t but some may like it. Also Kronika is a laughable boss who is worse than Blaze in my opinion. Nothing about her is cool or menacing.
- Mobile-tier grind for skins/brutalities. Towers of Time are bullshit.
- Annoying, unneeded slow-mo after fatalities/outros.
- Characters blend too much with the arenas. Maybe it's just me.
- Shao Kahn is a huge loser in this game who does nothing and then dies. His voice sucks, too.

Pros:
+ You can create custom variations. But they're not usable in ranked/competitive environment.
+ You can buy Frost for only 5.99$ even though you can unlock her by simply playing the story mode. Hooray!
+ Watching this game is more fun than actually playing it but not by much.

44,50398714,english,"I wanted to review this as someone coming from a different series of fighting games and hope that this Review can help someone make a decision. I will not be including in my Review the really late patches on PC as well there are plenty of people just review bombing it for only that and certainly not reviewing the game itself. 

Story -   I have really enjoyed the story of MK since 9 and this one is no exception. There was a lot of good character interactions that I really liked getting to see and that could only come from this weird time travel nonsense of a story. It is over the top a bit silly and completely mortal Kombat.    
That being said I definitely have a few issues. One it is kinda absurdly short. Like I was shocked at how short it was. Given all they have done with towers and such the fact that the game is so short was just a huge surprise. I know the thought of padding a game is normally frowned upon, but this game needs some padding and fluff and more fights. Little more character interactions could have been great. While there are great moments more characters could have definitely used more screen time and the story is so short I feel they deserve it.  Also I am guessing this is maybe fixed in the patch notes but pausing killed the in game cut scenes for me. 

Now What I REALLY wanted to get into. How is it as just a game. A fighter is defined by its game play and I was pretty surprised how much I got into it. I have gotten MK 9 and 10 previously and played the story and tossed them away after. They are just too odd for me to wrap my head around coming from SF and UMVC3 and even some anime fighters.  Maybe it was a better tutorial or change of thought, but as soon as I realized the game more wanted me to watch the combo's which given the spectacle that is MK makes sense things clicked a bit better. You put in your button combo and than get to watch it unfold Vs the more traditional level of control other fighters give you. It does mean you are pretty much buying an engagement ring for every action you are doing, but knowing that is how it works helps.  
All that being said I still think MK is the weakest of the successful fighting games. Block button is still just a dumb idea and I ended up switching from my Qanba fight stick to a controller just to make it function without breaking my hands. Tried a hitbox as well but I always felt the need to have the block button on standby so it really isn't friendly to fightsticks. And while once I knew the combo system wanted me to press everything than sit around watching the game I could combo perfectly fine, I still very much felt a huge lack of control over my character and the game. I much prefer more classic hot confirming/block strings setup.  

What really made me love this game though is it has tons of content I just do not get from other fighters. Story mode is there. Tons of Towers and other gameplay options to use. A huge Krypt with stuff to unlock! People complain about the microtransactions but they don't bother me in the least. Probably cause I have no intention of ever using them. Soooo much to unlock in game and I get to unlock it by PLAYING the game. MK has a WEALTH of options and towers and modes to play with. I look forward to the experience even though many are ""Frustrating."" Than again I remember the classic double flawless fatality on the pit only when freaking santa claus flies over the full moon. 

So TLDR.  Story was fun but needed padding. Tons of content to unlock and try out beyond just PVP. Combat system is a spectacle to watch though no where near that deep, but that makes it fun and accessible.   And I guess microtransactions still suck like they always have.

45,50398285,english,"Hi, unfortunately I was unable to buy this game from my main account due to reasons outside of my control (Ukraine issues)
Other than that and occasional freezes this game is AMAZING. This is the best Mortal Kombat I ever played since MK Trilogy (not that Trilogy was the best one but it was the one that started my love to fighting games)
Here are my pros and cons
Pros:
- More deep fighting system than any previous installment. I previously used to look down at MK as being childhood game but not a serious fighting game. The one that I used mostly for mashing with my more casual friends while we are playing Tekken and Guilty Gear X with those who want to play seriously. NOT ANYMORE. Lots of respect to Netherrealm for those changes.
- Better graphics. Along with higher polygonal count colors are more vivid 
- More immersive environments
- Better animations that make characters very lively
- Story actually worth playing through with very cinematic action
- Because of improvements to graphics/animations/worthwhile story I actually started to love most of the cast. If previously I only played a bunch of chars (Noob, Smoke, Kabal, Night wolf) now I love more than half of the roster! I even enjoy playing Sonya and Kano, which I previously considered very boring)
- There are char costumes. Yes they are random unlocks mostly, but I think game offers more than enough for its price to consider them a nice extra instead of b**ing about possibility to buy some of them with real money or the grind required to receive a particular costume.

Cons:
- Ukraine has difficulties purchasing this game but it's not a fault of the game studio (well.. they could remove Soviet Union Scarlet costume, that should help, I suppose)
- I had it frozen like 3 times during several days. Still way better than previous games in this series

53,50397114,english,"I rarely give game reviews, but Mortal Kombat has been one of those games I've played since I was a little kid--way back in the early 1990's. I've watched the evolution of the games over the years, of the character design, the graphics fidelity, and the platforms it's been on. From the sub shop arcades to my 2080Ti-powered PC. I wouldn't consider myself a fighting game master--not then, and not now. So I won't comment on how well it holds up in the tournament scene.

Firstly--if at all possible you must play this game in HDR10 mode. It's absolutely gorgeous to look at if you've got a high quality display and graphics setup. The game handles incredibly well at my 4K, 98Hz, HDR10 setup.

Secondly--let me comment on the character design. Long gone are the days of the palette swaps of old. Each character has received their own model and design, and they are intricately beautiful. Jade is no longer a green Kitana, but is beautiful in her own right. Kitana's character design is downright gorgeous. And I really dig Sub-Zero and Scorpion's characters. This is flat out the most high caliber animation to grace a Mortal Kombat game. And the art team involved went above and beyond to making just absolutely fantastic characters.

So that said...let's get to the story. Mortal Kombat, and fighting games in general, have never been well known for their stories. In the days of old, each character maybe had a couple of paragraphs written about them as a back story--and honestly, it's much of the same in today's characters. There just isn't much depth to them at the moment. And it's sad. The team did a fantastic job animating and telling the story that is there, and it's just super well executed. But all of this time travel world-ending Outworld stuff is just.....bleh. They did a great job *telling* this story with the animation, the characters, etc. But the game could seriously use another overhaul, reboot, or just re-imagining in its original story design.

This game is phenomenal, though. I feel like its one of the few games that straddles the line between technical and simple (kind of like Soul Calibur). It's easy enough that a lot of people aren't going to feel pressured to learn advanced techniques like cancels and frame data (but it's there if you need it, in really concise digestible bites). The characters are universally fun to play, and the production values are miles ahead of many other games (and wayyy ahead of other fighters).

The singleplayer campaign is surprisingly compelling, since MK's lore can be broken down into ""punch people"" and ""we'll figure it out later."" Character animations are beautiful, levels are well-designed and fun, and music is catchy but not intrusive.

I don't mind the Krypt since it's great nostalgia for the (awful, but loveable) MK film, and an inventive way to give out loot while giving you backstories.

Towers of Time will absolutely crucify you at this point. Imagine fighting a hard difficulty AI while getting rockets from every direction, with the screen turning black, oh and the character has 3 times the health of you. Its absurd.

I love mortal kombat, and this game is no an exception to that.  It IS a good game, its just not a GREAT game yet.

If you have been following the news and shitstorm following the PC release of this game, then you might know.  As of posting this the PC version of this game is like 3 patches behind the PS4 version of the game.  The PC version of this game is more or less Day 0 as far as patching wise.  Online Matches are plagued with Desync problems, Towers of Time are a hot bullshit mess of insane difficulty, the grind for Koins, Souls, and Hearts is just completely unreal to deal with right now, seeing as how many chests you unlock in the krypt are several thousands of Koins, and you only get a couple hundred tops for doing a fight, unlike the PS4 version where  you get 1-5k Koins depending on which mode you fight on.  Frame data is incomplete, if not entirely innaccurate, due to never being appropriately patched like the WB said they would be.

I really wish I could recommend this game in its current state to most users or anyone into the FGC, but I cannot in good conscious do so.  I may change this review at a later date, to follow up depending on if the devs ACTUALLY update something in this game.

After beating all of the classic towers (less endless obviously) and beating the full campaign, and all of Towers of time I could handle I have not unlocked a single skip fight.

The actual game play is great when there is no modifiers and the story is really good. If they just reigned in the modifiers and made them affect both you and your opponents and fixed the ridiculous RNG only grind for unlockable this would be a great game.

86,50394072,english,"I don't usually do reviews but I decided I would for this game because I couldn't and still can't decide if I would recommend this.
The story mode was great and the games combat is awesome! Not sure how I feel about the roster. It is missing many characters. I am hoping for a Story Mode Pack DLC as they have NPC characters that people want to play but are not playable. This happened in MKX where they had Rain as an NPC but not a playable character which is why I refused to get the game since I was a Rain main back in MK9. 
Online play is alright. Game can be laggy here and there but still playable. 
The main problem is in the Towers of Time. It is unbalanced. In some matches, my Fatal Blow does 70 damage while the enemy can do a Fatal Blow for 460 of my health... 
In some modifications, the enemy can summon an AI to jump in and do an attack. It can be annoying when you are in the middle of a combo but I understand it. The problem though is when the enemy can do it EVERY 4 SECONDS!!!! NPC jumps in, I get knocked down, by the time I get back up they can do it again. 
Now I know that NetherRealm is releasing patches to balance out of the game and when and if this happens I will change my review but come on, why release it when its just no fun playing in the towers to unlock cosmetics which is what I usually enjoy.

87,50393998,english,"Pros:
     -Best Mk graphics by a mile
     -Interesting story - packed full of action (and great rewards for completing it too)
     -So much customisation!
     -Not actually that many micro-transactions. People are complaining because they exist but they aren't that prevalent, 
       and they really don't have any impact on the game at all.
     - The Krypt is a fun puzzle mini-game 3rd person. Prices of loot boxes are fair any easily attainable.
     - No connection issues

Neutral: 
     - Slower pace for gameplay (no sprint etc.). Up to you to decide if pro or con. 

Cons:
     - Towers of Time feel annoying with augments, to the point where some fights really feel impossible.
     - Getting hearts feels very very grindy sometimes. (But I understand they're trying to make changes to this)
 
Overall, one of the, if not the, best mortal kombat games yet. Micro-transactions really don't play that much of a deal, but it's slightly overshadowed by the frustrating towers of time. Would recommend but if you are still unsure, just wait for sales/komplete edition. 

If you have the money to drop and you're an MK fan, I'd definitely pick this one up. But if you have the patience to wait for sales and wait for some of the difficulty problems to be patched, it might be better for you.

2,50391116,english,"MK11 is... a mixed bag. I'm seeing a lot of improvement on its predecessors in some areas, but also steps back in others. The triple character variations of MKX have been replaced by a system that lets you customize a loadout of special moves for the characters you use (as well as cosmetic costume parts), which you have to unlock by playing through the game or with in-game currency. Not the biggest fan of this. The brutal, but also easily exploited X-rays of previous games are now restricted to players whose lifebar is nearly depleted, which I like. It makes them into an opportunity to turn the tide of a fight, instead of just a cheap shot. The gameplay has further been laid bare with elaborate move info like frame data that I expect pleases the really hardcore players, even if it means little to me.

I've always mainly been into the Mortal Kombat series for its weird characters and fantasy-sci-fi-mashup storylines. Mainly here, I feel kind of disappointed. Without getting to deep into it, the game again delves into time travel, using a time-manipulating villain, to explain away why you're seeing characters who were dead before (Baraka) or characters in previous incarnations (ie, Liu Kang and Kung Lao). In MK9, time screwery was used inventively to untangle the messy continuity of the series and paint over old canon. I liked the storyline of MKX and would've preferred to just see them follow that up with something new, instead of going backwards again. The character selection we get this time, I'm fairly happy with - there's no one conspicuously absent, and at the present time I've tried to stay ignorant of who might be introduced later as addon characters. I do find the crop of three new characters (four if you count the boss) rather disappointing, against the 8 or so new (and interesting) characters introduced in MKX.

There's clearly been some graphic overhauls, the detail and facial animation in particular looks extremely good. Story Mode is again my main interest in the game, and while it's rife with hammy acting, lines ripped straight from baby's first action movie and magical contrivances up the wazoo, you can tell the cinematic game (camera angles, action sequences, soundtrack) has really been upped. Set against that is that almost everything looks... really bland. Part of that is I feel the lighting is incredibly flat and undramatic compared to MKX, which I remember being far more moody. Parts of MK11 remind me of MK9 in a bad way. I'm really, really disappointed in the character designs. Nearly everyone's outfit looks kind of dull and uncool, as if the designers didn't really feel up to it - or Netherrealm doesn't have the same artists at work as with the previous game. I wonder if this has to do with the character customization option, like they expended too much time making sure every hat and mouth mask would match the rest of the outfit. With the exception of D'Vorah, who looks way improved over her previous look, and Skarlet, who has had a pretty radical redesign, none of the characters look interesting. Why give Cassie Cage a ponytail when that makes her almost indistinguishable from Sonya? Scorpion and Sub-Zero come in looking blander than they've ever been. And the new characters may have a lot of shiny junk hanging off of them, none of them look like they have staying power. The milquetoast looks and crummy lighting are compounded by the uninspired voicework. Few voice actors from the previous game(s) seem to have returned. Ronda Rousey does not bring much to the table as Sonya, nor do the new voice actors for characters like Jax or Cassie. What doesn't help is that lots of characters that wear mouth masks sound as if their actor is speaking into a cup, for realism. MK the Movie's Cary Tagawa is finally brought back to reprise Shang Tsung, but I haven't had a chance to hear much of him yet.

Lastly, MK11 seems to double down on the need for minibuys for those who want to get the full experience. Starting up the game, I was prompted to install a 1 GB app on my phone in order to get an additional announcer voicepack. When I went to try it, reviewers were already complaining of dropping money into the thing with disappointing results. I want to understand that with game production becoming costlier and costlier, this kind of practice is the only way to keep the business profitable, but it really does turn me off from a game.

I'm a very visually oriented guy and the look of 11 has really soured me on the whole thing. Unfortunate. Of course, that's me focusing hard on like a tertiary tier of importance about what makes a fighting game. It still plays well with nice kinetic feedback, cool moves, and a wealth of content. I'm probably ragging too hard on not liking this one's rendition of the characters. Mortal Kombat is still a good time and I'll probably spend some time unlocking stuff until the fun wears off.",1556567891,1556567891,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197983794856,538,60,1268,0,457,1577828903,,

Yep. You can't play the game if the servers don't work.

Do the servers work? Maybe?

Should you buy a game on a ""maybe it will work""? No.

The game has a lot of ""care about the characters"" junk that's just laughable in MK.
The game has ""woke"" endings.
The game censors every female character but has the male characters in loincloths.

The game has a baby combat system, MKX gives you tons of combos and MK11 is basically half of that.
The game is loot box based even though the loot system is totally random and super slow to acquire gold.
You can complete a challenge and get 200 gold. You need 14k+ to get anything good and it's still 100% random.

kill you faster, AI is cranked up into overdrive so if you can't do a perfect flawless 100% HP combo on the AI you will not win,
any attack that you will  try to do AI will instantly reverse it and launch you into a massive combo and if you are lucky they won't do it again as they finish the first combo, but probably by then the modifier that drains your health will probably kill you anyway.

The time Crystal's are used for skins in a premium store that cycles ONCE PER DAY. you cannot buy every skin through the store, Its to purchase a skin with the money you can earn that you have not been able to find in the krypt.

Now, people are saying the krypt is terrible but dont realize how bad MKX krypt was. It's a vast major improvement utilizing puzzles and discoveries to unlock new areas. Furthermore, people are starting that the you can purchase other currencies for the krypt. This is a total misinforming lie. You cannot purchase Koins (which are earned through everything you do.) Souls (which are earned by winning matches) and Hearts (which are earned through doing fatalities/brutalities). Each of these are varying rarity but are not purchasable, limited, or otherwise unfair by a ridiculous amount.

- The day one patched actually fixed a litany of bugs and issues that are still present to date

32,50381076,english,"Struggling here.  Honestly that should be the name of the game.  Struggling.  This isn't a Mortal Kombat game.  I refuse to believe the Devs really wanted to put their names on this.

Also, don't buy Frost.  They try to bait you into buying Frost, but then you get her after completing story mode.  I'm just glad I'm not a Frost player; I heard there was a backlash about her being paid DLC.

Spoiler warning: Everything I'm about to say, you've probably heard from Maxdood, AngryJoe, etc.  All I'm here to do is confirm it.  

Pros: 
-Beautiful game visually.
-Characters are artistic and each have their own unique playstyles and visual styles.
-PVP is satisfying.
-Tier system in characters is very obvious but no characters feel particularly underpowered in my experience.
-Story was great (though it only took about 5 hours to finish).
-They were nice enough to provide non-revenant versions of characters like Kung Lao, Liu, etc, so you don't have to play a gray edgelord if that ain't your bag.

That's about it.  It's a good Kombat game.  It's great if you like Kombat and don't care about anything but pvp.

Cons:  Don't buy this game.  Anecdote: After suffering an injury to my arm, I virtually wasn't able to do anything but play video games and wait for it to heal.  In that entire time which comprised a large amount of game time, I haven't unlocked 1% of this games content.  I haven't unlocked a percent of a percent of it.  I've knocked down maybe 40 towers now, and I still have next to none of the unlockable gear.
-The Krypt is RNG, and eats up NECESSARY resources so quickly you'll get to spend maybe 10 minutes before you're out of kurrency items.  You'll also need these kurrency items to open up towers which allow you to progress in the first place.
-Gaining kurrency is WAY too stingy, and you'll have to fight tooth and nail for every bit of it.  Hearts are one per fatality/brutality, and you need 250 of them per heart chest, often times for a character you don't use and don't need stuff for.  You can do the math on that one.
-Tower of Time is pointlessly difficult.  The Devs came out and said they made it easier, but honestly, it's borderline impossible a lot of the time.  I suggest going on youtube to see the kind of back-assward stuff they want you to spend hours doing, often times just for a few koins (like 100) and maybe a heart if you do the fatality.

This game is not optimized well.  For example, it doesn't have split screen functionality- if you click away from the game window, it pauses.  This isn't a problem for normal fighting games, but this fighting game puts a heavy emphasis on AI battle so often times, you're in a situation where you're just watching the game play itself and hoping you win.  Now if only you could minimize it!  But no, they wanted this game to be the only thing you could do while it was on, and they want you to pour ungodly amounts of hours into it.  I assure you that most of the people who've put hours into this game, only did so because you can play an hour or two a day and have nothing, or keep it open all day and maybe have a nice hat.  I'm leaning towards the former though.

With the changes to Krypt, in being RNG, you should never have a point where you open up a 8000 koin chest to find a piece of koncept art, but here we are.  Just a little while ago, I opened up a 14000 koin chest and got a single gear augment for Cetrion (no skin, no gear, just a gemstone pretty much if you're not familiar with the game ling), for Cetrion though, probably one of the most unasked for characters in the game, and nothing else.  Thanks Netherrealm.

You might think I sound salty, and I am.  I finally came to the point where I had to ask, why am I even playing this game.  I've NEVER gotten to that point on a videogame that I can remember.  I had a few pvp matches, I had fun with the story, but now it's like I almost don't even wanna bother putting time in, because it's literally just feeding ratings for this game.  It's not that MK11 is a bad game.  It's just one of the most unethical pieces of gaming I've ever played in my life, and the Netherrealm people should be ashamed of how badly they f-ed this game up.  I was SO hyped for this.  I even went back to MK10 just to freshen my skills back up before this game was out.  You dropped the ball, NR.  I'll be waiting to hear about fixes.

As a sidenote: It was brought to my attention that a lot of people are bombing this game because of political ideology and de-sexualization of characters and stuff. I'm not here for all that. I could give two f-s how low cut Jade's top is, I main Kotal anyway. Videogames are a welcomed respite from political bs, and while I'm aware that it's in there, ""Make Outworld Great Again""(Shao)/""I would not allow Female Lin Kuei (Noob to Frost)""/etc. I can ignore it. In all fairness, I wish they hadn't. It's nice to be able to play a game and not be reminded of irl stupidity, but here we are in 2019, Donald Trump wears a dragon skull and swings a giant hammer. Sounds pretty badass if you ask me.

But in all seriousness, the politics to me are an afterthought. The problem is the game itself, and the legendary levels of bs it asks you to endure.

Don't bother taking a Sub-Zero assist, because the CPUs will suddenly gain the ability to block while frozen.

35,50381780,english,"TLDR: If you are a new player to fighting games. This game is going to suck for you in every way because they are going to lock you out from earning any money through painful and boring battles that a beginner would never be able to do.

Single Player:
Great story, then you actually get into the game by playing towers. Which are honestly horrible.

The only way you can progress and make money is off the dumb towers of time. In the last game only a few stages in the tower would have modifiers but now in the MK11 ""Towers of Time"" every character has a modifier and it honestly sucks. For example I played against Liu Kang, if I get near him I take a heap of damage. I'm half dead after doing one combo on him and he hasn't hit me. I physically cannot deal damage fast enough to kill him. Go against Frost, if I hit her three times in a row I get frozen and lose health so can't combo her. Basically to do the towers you have to cower in the corner spamming range attacks so static effects don't hurt you. Then you have to use these dumb consumables to keep yourself alive. It's boring, it's rage inducing and I'm honestly pissed at Nether Realm for this.  

Multiplayer:
Great so far. It has good connection. I'm newish to fighting games though so it's pretty tough to win any fights. It can be really un-motivating if you aren't that good. And you guessed it you get literally nothing for losing so you aren't going to earn anything. Which sucks for me because I want to earn money in some way.

Conclusion:
Overall I'm pretty upset, I really liked the campaign and thought this game was going to be great. I wish they could have something, anything, which is actually reasonable for a newer player to do. So I recommend most people just ignore this game unfortunately unless you are going to dedicate a lot of time into getting better.",1556518570,1556518570,False,3,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198133090910,57,1,6362,0,1182,1590734639,,

They work just like injustice 2 and its ""simulations"", every so often a tower will come up for a character, you fight in that tower to a boss, get the gear. But sometimes the towers are just unbeatable without certain consumables from the krypt.

Story mode is as good as ever and an obvious contender for the best story mode ever made in a fighting game. The Cages and Shaolin Monks are standouts this time, both getting very satisfying arcs.

On the negative side, the Towers of Time really are as bad as people are saying, but Netherealms has promised patches and has been very transparent with their communication so far. So long as they keep their word and reduce the difficulty, I think it has potential. 

As good as is the gameplay, as bad as is the singleplayer grind they made. As is, the whole loop of Towers of Time and the Krypt is an exercise in time wasting. (When your most efficient way to farm these modes is to have an AI play against another AI, this is a big problem)

The reason I'm still giving this game a thumbs up is because the rest of the experience is absolutely superb and I'm trusting Netherealms to deliver on their promise of fixing up the Towers.

Would I recommend it?  Sure.

I had no issues with installation and initial gameplay, the graphics are excellent, and the limitation of long combinations was needed.    

However, the gameplay feels a bit slow and clunky and lacks the rhythm of MK XL.

I would love if it was sped up by 10-15% and incorporated the ability to quickly step toward or away from the opponent by at least 2-3 steps (maybe I just haven't figured out how yet?).  

The AI in tower play feels like it's reading the player's input and providing a perfect counter - it's overly obvious and calculating.
Sometimes it feels like player's inputs are being locked out while it provides a counter.   At the very least, the AI needs to make me feel like it's trying to think about the right counter move.

Initial sound volume level needs to be increased slightly.  I have to turn up the sound system more than normal to hear everything easily even through the volume is set at 100%.

The hitting/kicking sound effects need a bit more impact like they had in MK XL.

I am hopeful that some of my concerns above will be addressed in future game updates.

64,50378924,english,"MK11 is a good game, with a few problems

I would say it is worth 30 to 40 dollars, so get it on sale.

What I liked:
The story mode, tower conquest, online match making, crypt, and practice

What I don't like:
Time tower conquest, consent reminders to purchase power ups for matches, and most of the game's extras being locked behind the crypt.

So, when you begin the game, you will have all characters, but not all fatalities, or costumes.  Those come from random drops in the crypt, forge items, or time tower conquest.  You can play and enjoy the game without those things, but this is where I start getting frustrated with the game.
In the crypt, you use three resources (coins, hearts, and souls) to open different chests, use the forge, and unlock new areas of the crypt.  However, each match nets you fairly little in terms of resources (a few hundred coins, zero to two hearts depending on how you finish of the opponent, and ten souls) thus it takes quite some time to get the resources necessary to do anything in the crypt.  This is where the micro transactions comes into play: you can purchase items to ""enhance"" how much you get from a match, or buying things straight up.  You do get the money resource (time crystals) by leveling up and getting achievements, but most things require a few hundred to a few thousand, and you get about ten per level up.

This urks me, because I wish to obtain certain costumes, and unlock fatalities for my more played characters, instead I often get items for the rest of the cast.  I understand this is how free to play mobile games work, I just hate it inside of a full price triple a game.

Now, for the time towers, these are random towers that change up every so often.  Everything seems okay, but your damage is cut in half (I know this one), and your enemies will have environmental assistance and difficulty set at the highest level (Or so I think); in an attempt to force you to use up consumables, in an attempt to get you to purchase more from the store, thus getting you to spend more money.  Would not be so bad, but several items for each character are locked into these towers.  Another bloody obvious money grabbing attempt.

So, the positive, the story mode does its job, and isn't too bad to play through.  You get a ton of things for playing through it, and it concludes this story arc of Mortal Kombat.

The practice mode does an excellent job of getting used to different characters, and concepts.  It isn't too hard to get the basics down, and some experimentation is required to find additional combos and understanding advance tactics.

The conquest towers, the staple of Mortal Combat, are enjoyable, except for the annoying final boss.  Even on lower difficulties, the boss can randomly decide that it has enough of you, and will kill you, without regard to anything you attempt.  Thus, the final boss can come off as a luck base win, versus a skill base win.  The enemies take normal damage, and help get you ready for online play.

Online play, is online play.

It is a decent triple a fighting game, with an unnecessary free to play game model placed on the game's extras.

This particular installment is somewhat weird for an AAA title in a way that it doesn't ooze quality. What it oozes is a disregard for the vast playerbase of the series. 
I've bought MK11 for occasional offline versus play with some guests and it fits the purpose well yet the whole package at full price is laughable at best and I wouldn't recommend this to anyone willing to sink some time into this.

Good part that fighting is pretty decent, sound and graphics are alright, nothing spectacular yet rather satisfying.
If that's sufficient for you I'd say it's worth buying for 25$, that's what I've paid for it.

On to the bad stuff.

1. Black bars. I got a 34"" Ultrawide 3.5k monitor. I only get fullscreen during the fighting sequences. Even the crypt is not fullscreen which is damn annoying. You get black bars during the cut scenes and menu browsing.

2. Crypt (to hell with the ""K"").It's even more annoying than black bars on my screen. Terrible controls, terrible graphics, terrible content. Feels like a cheaply last-minute made addition to suck your money out dry with the microtransactions.

3. Microtransactions. If you want some cosmetics and solo progression then you'll have to spend some cash. I personally don't care about that part of the game yet it's still annoying as hell.

4. Four different in-game currencies for various purposes. Some are premium, some are not. Still looks like a freaking F2P mobile junk asset to me. Don't get me started on the amount of consumables types for solo progression, it's too damn much for a fighting game.

5. Story and ""lore"". That's my personal annoyance, guess someone might like the ""lore"" and story  in a game called Mortal Kombat. Still, when you add time travel means you're really out of ideas and the main antagonist is nothing to look at at all. 

6. Fighters roster. I miss quite a few toons from the current selection but guess that might change in the nearest future, yet still pretty underwhelming list at this point.

-Censorship, political statements, cash shop when not a MMO(PeerToPeerLag), ugly costume spree, clunky movement, complicated fighter controls. 
-Game causes lag when trying to multi-task other applications when dealing with the grind. 


-Doesn't respect the players time to play the game. If a player plays casually and has other things to do in their life this game will get in the way. It's towers take long to play through due to their difficulty. This content locks the game away from players that have less time to play. An AI can play for the player but not for all towers or to unlock stuff with certain moves needed to be used. Using the AI isn't playing the game and a feature that requires the AI to play for the player means it's not gameplay for the players to play through. Even with the AI playing the difficulty can squash the AI if the player doesn't have the right konsumables or earned augments in use for the fight. The player can be konsumable starved to make it impossible to get the AI through the fight. The Towers change and reset at set times. If the player doesn't pass the tower in that set time they loose their progress. Earning items in the game take multiple currency's. Each currency is earned at different rates. Gold the fastest, green souls and then hearts (if the player or AI is doing brutalities or fatalities). Time crystals is another currency in the game that players can earn on character level ups and after multiple towers. It's also the currency that can be bought by players to unlock randomly offered items in the game store. This game doesn't deserve having a cash shop and multiple currencies for what it's offering for players to do. It's a full price 60 dollar fighting game. Most fighting games do not reduce lag with hosted servers for multiple players to play on which would justify having a cash shop. Their servers do not help with connections to other players in matches which means their asking for more than what they offer. It's not a MMO game. 

-Political statements are within the game. Jax story ending being woke racist towards white people. He used to be pro american. Shao Kahn make outworld great again to kollector. Turned out to be positive joke but still reminds people of politics in a get away from reality game. 

-Censorship in a M rated game. Johnny Cage has a taunt that has lost the ""uck"" of his voice. Only squeels F. 

-The ladies in game have a ugly costume spree except a few while guys have overly sexy costumes. Guy's are lacking badass looking costumes along with the girls.

Okay, so now lets ACTUALLY review the game!

It's great. It's a grand-slam in the optimization department. It works really well on somewhat older cards, with cards like the 970 being able to run it at max settings easily and without frame drops.

The story mode is more of a movie than a game, but I'm ok with that. It tells a really good story and while I disliked the ending, I can understand the ramifications of it and look forward to the story being pushed forward even more.

Microtransactions, something I'm sure everyone is complaining about, are practically nonexistent. You earn Time Crystals (The paid currency) by playing the game, and some random costumes are shown in the time crystal shop each day. As long as you are not trying to actively buy every single costume you see, you'll practically never need to buy time crystals, as just by the time I've hit level 25 I've had enough to buy two. Ontop of that ALL (Except the DLC specific costumes like Red Star Skarlet) are just the same ones you earn ingame in the krypt. The rate at which you earn currency is also being buffed soon, so by the time that happens I doubt anyone would ever even NEED to buy time crystals to get a costume unless they could not wait whatsoever and have a compulsive need to blow as much money as possible. 

The Krypt is NOT random. People keep saying it's random lootboxes, and I can understand that fear, but the contents of each box is pre-determined. Their location changes per player, but each chest will have the same stuff in it. This was covered in the kombat kast, but it's worth throwing in here to show that its quite forgiving and with the upcoming increases to currency gain, it will be less demanding of your time than it is on launch, making it even more of a fun way to earn goodies. 

The Towers are currently undergoing changes to be easier to do and less punishing (Like for example, being able to block offscreen attacks.) as well as giving more currency and being all around more player friendly. There's also co-op towers which is REALLY fun, being able to work with another player to beat a tough AI.

Combat wise, the game is going to be difficult for people who play 2D fighters like FighterZ, Under Night, Blazblue, Guiilty gear, ect. Might be a little more forgiving of Street Fighter players, but even Tekken/Soul calibur players are going to have to put some time into getting used to the way mortal kombat works. Vets of MK or Injustice should have no issue sliding right into the games DM's and doing work, with a few minor adjustments. It favors getting smaller but more tight combos in compared to something like FighterZ, which favors long ""Touch of death"" style combos. It has a strong Neutral game in general, without feeling slow or drawn out. 

Overall, this game is a solid 9.0/10 for ME. Some people might not like the style of combat, or some might find having to unlock costumes at a somewhat ""Random"" pace annoying, especially if there's one specific one they want. However, for people who enjoy unlocking things and being surprised, it's going to be an enjoyable ride.",1556043960,1556485068,True,3,0,0.527527153491973877,0,True,False,False,76561198015347457,444,98,3408,0,21,1596458976,,

92,50375267,english,"Being a Mortal Kombat fan since well... Mortal Kombat 2, I was waiting for this game and wanted to love it!
But what a let down ! This MK11 took everything that went wrong in MK10 and developped it further.

First of all, while you launch the game for the first time, before even reaching the main menu, the game tries to bait you to play the mobile MK game to get additional content (here, an announcer voice) this wasn't a good sign at all.
Then, the Krypt is horrendous, they spent hours and days developping what is like a pure mobile game... different currencies with overpriced lootbox instead of adding real content like characters.
Yes, lootbox! Because the content of each box is totally random! The krypt is a pure raging disaster with too many stuff to unlock like... Icons of different colors? Fudge it !

The game keeps crashing, disconnecting for servers (because you need a constant connection to internet to be able to play as if it was a MMO) and not registering what you unlock. Also, don't expect 60fps all the time either.
Graphical bugs are numerous too ! (even if patching is making it better)

The game is not friendly to controllers unless you use a pure Xbox controller you will have to fight with the game make the controller work with X360CE or Xinput.

Ed Boon promised a story explaining all MK up to date? Nah! Forget about that! It's not even about time travel.
Other MK are barely mentioned and the fact the roster only has 25 characters makes the story very limited.
Sector and Cyrax are in the game but you cannot control them (just as you could not control Baraka and Rain in MK10)
The story ends also very quickly without any explaination of what is to come.

You will have to go through a tutorial to unlock Shao Kahn as an announcer and earn some more gold for the krypt but the tutorial is hellishly hard thanks to a move list basically made of ""back, forward + A, B, X or Y)
And personally, back, forward is a move I find really hard to do on a controller without also going through up/down by mistake.
Combos are harder to make than in MK10 and once you get the hang of it, you discover that all combos do not have the same timing making them really hard to execute.
And this amazingly long tutorial gives you some nice tips but ask you to execute combo which needs hours of practice.
The tutorial is too big and does not explain things correctly with the correct type of character.

Rewards are small for a game so hard. You never feel like you get a reward worth of the effort you put into the game.

Easy fatalities are back ! It was already a bad idea in MK10, here they are again and you need to pay for them, use the premium currency of time crystals to make them... You purchase the game and the season pass and what do you discover? they want you to pay to unlock Frost (don't do that, you'll unlock her after finishing the story which isn't too long) and other costumed are locked behind a pay wall ! Yes, you purchase a season pass to get only half of what you have to pay for... Luckily for you, for $99.99 you'll get a few time crystal worth of your time.

And I'm not even done criticizing the game! Too many complex system which will only be appreciated by high level players.
The Season pass has 9 characters, 4 of which are ""guest""... The game doesn't have any guest and it made me happy, I thought they finally understood players wanted MK characters and not guest... Well, I was so wrong !

Some character design are horrendous like Johnny Cage who doesn't look like Johnny anymore! Sub-Zero is not charismatic at all, Scarlet is really ugly... At least they got Liu Kang, Kitana and Jade right !
The new character using time, Geras, is really slow, one of his move especially is too long and too slow without any impact.
Talking of characters, they removed many new cool moves of MK10 to replace them with new ones.
Scorpion doesn't stun anymore with his spear, he automatically hits the opponent in the back with his sword, making the move really annoying as it becomes hard to combo or uppercut the opponent.
But it's only one example among other.

The new customization system is really not interesting, many skins (to unlock) and gear to level and boost similar to what was present in Injustice 2 but a little bit different and the move set you add are limited to adding 2 or 3 skills.
The system is really not pleasant and a clear downgrade of what mk10 gave us.

There is a new AI vs AI system where you need to customize 3 characters and equip them correctly and hope your AI will be the strongest against other players AI -_- No, it's not a good idea, it's a fighting game, not a sport manager simulation game NetherRealm  !!!

What else can I say? No Rain, no Reptile, no Sindel, No Ermac, No Kenshin, No Takeda, ... And the list goes on!
The roster could have used so many more characters instead of using your time developping what I would describe as a .... Premium Free 2 play !

At least I'm quite happy about the female characters looking amazingly good, except Scarlet which doesn't match her name. They could have kept her hair totally blood red at least !
In Street Fighter, Ryu is Ryu no matter what... In MK, characters do change a lot and even change nationnality !
Kitana is beautiful, but she's asian and that 's disturbing me because she never was before.

I'll add again the x-ray system was nice but here, they added too many animations slowing down the rate of the fight.
It was nice in MK9/10 but they really over did it this time.

A pure let down I am really not enjoying at all !

TL;DR
I'm not complaining about how political people think the game is, I'm not complaining about the females not fighting in bikini or whatever many players can have against MK11. MK11 disapointed me because it couldn't keep it's promise.
Moves Input and available moves for each characters is disapointing, new design is not always welcome, new mechanisms (during fight and outside of it as well like customization), timing for combo, new character Geras, missing characters, AI vs AI and equipment levels and most importantly the krypt and it's galore of  expensive lootbox to unlock are all horrendous !

 I'm mainly disappointed with the utter lack of polish with the gameplay and online play, it seems during a match at any point the game will suddenly decide that the game has ""desynchronized"" and that's that no more match, that happens all the time there is currently no avoiding it.

And the stupid timed towers are sometimes actually impossible, imagine the classic mortal kombat tower main differences being....

#1 the AI gets a huge HP buff making them hard to take down
#2 you get constantly assaulted by poison missiles and stupid hazzards like that that are UNBLOCKABLE
#3 they force you to use crappy consumable items to even stand a slight chance at beating a level sometimes

So grinding out the coins for the customisation items takes an long time and is frustrating as hell.....
Which leads me onto another point the krypt and the pointlessly large amount of skins, equipment pieces,  concept art and music that feel like filler crappy unlockables that just stop you unlocking the things you want like new fatalitys or brutalitys like you know things that actually effect the gameplay.

Oh yeah and it randomly crashes sometimes? not a lot but here and there the game just crashes out of nowhere so that's fun.

21,50369142,english,"MK11 is the best of all MKs in terms of gameplay, kombo variety / utilisation between different characters, animations and varying reliance / power of specials. The sheer customisation of different specials and the fact that you can build any of your favourite fighters as you wish, it all makes up for the best feeling MK to date. And best looking also. The campaign was surprisingly the best it has been in years with incredible pre rendered cutscenes and spectacles. Arenas used throughout and the plot points all lead to a very refreshing main story that helps you get accustomed to new fighters and their deep variety of kombos / specials. Campaign is certainly a Hollywood experience but is still a breath of fresh air in terms of quality.

If only the micro-transactions weren't so aggressive... Especially how insidious the ""Konsumables"" are. They inorganically motivate players who struggle in certain fights to just ""Skip Fight"" or use a healing potion, real in game advantages that only rarely drop from level ups or completing a tower fight with a character in style (which are the best the series saw in this game). The problem with in game advantages is because those who need them are likely not going to be able to beat the last opponent in those challenge towers and as such would look to spend real money on them... so damn greedy. 

I really wish this game had more attention brought onto the actual gameplay, flow and feel of the fight and just how damn satisfying the animations are. My main in this title is actually a brand new fighter introduced as Kollector he is a badass in terms of dishing out pure kombos at short and mid range.

22,50368902,english,"okay, so, as a fan of the franchise for +- 10 years, I always had the game on consoles up until mkx, and well that game was great on the pc 
But mk11? oh man, the fps capping and drops on fatal blows, main menu's and fatalaties make me feel extremely distracted from the amazing gore the game has to offer, but, its not game changing, and im sure the devs will fix it all in one patch coming up soon 

The gameplay of the game is brilliant, probably the best i've seen in any of the installations of the franchise aswell as the netcode, as someone from South Africa i find myself playing vs EU players with 170 ping feeling like 10 ping. 

BUT the one big problem which i really can't see myself getting over unless completely revamped/hotfixed is the grind for the game. It seems impossible to understand why the hell we need to go the Krypt every 30 hours of grinding use your Koins in 10 minutes and get 40 items for a karakter you dont even play, It's ridiculous.

The whole variation system was implimented in mkx and its awesome but its not awesome when you have you spend 50 hours to MAYBE get one for your main, its annoying but atleast you can kompete with the 2 default variations.

        [td][b]Immersion/Game World/Story[/b][/td]
        [td]""Finish Him""! Mortal Kombat 11 wants to build on the virtues of its predecessor and inspire players not only with a completely exaggerated depiction of violence, but also with an advanced mechanics and a high-class story. And the latter is undoubtedly successful. Directly after the events of the predecessor, the Netherrealm Studios veteran Ed Boon call up all the stops. Camera angles, screenplay, action, soundtrack: everything is of first-class quality and very often reminds of the superhero movies from the houses DC and Marvel, then again of Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy with just as much pathos. During the six hours or so in which you take part in about 50 fights, which are framed by partly dramatic, partly funny, but always very entertaining cutscenes, you don't just jump from protagonist to protagonist.  
		
		Sometimes you can choose between two available characters, whereas the replay value is still limited, as the paths are only short until the end of the respective chapter. Nevertheless: all Far Eastern competitors can only dream of the intensity with which Netherrealm has developed the story mode in Mortal Kombat. Not only has the story been extended to include the charismatic and power-hungry timekeeper Kronika, who in her best moments is reminiscent of Hela from Thor Ragnarok, impressively embodied by Cate Blanchett. You take references to many older episodes of the story and not only bring them together credibly, but also use the several time levels to bring classic with new characters on a screen. It goes without saying that the atmosphere benefits from the improved facial expressions like in Injustice 2 and the seamless transitions between cutscene and battle intro.

        [td][b]Gameplay[/b][/td]
        [td]But the story would only be half as entertaining if the fighting system didn't keep up. And here, too, Netherrealm excels. Not only does it offer an overflowing tutorial that deals with every facet of the simple surface mechanics, but with its timing-based combo system it is quite complex. Basic attacks, defense, combos, the modification of attacks via the amplifier on the right shoulder button, which eats a segment of the new attack/defense indicator, the importance of frame numbers in forward and execution attacks: nothing goes unmentioned. 
		
		There's also a separate chapter for each of the over 20 characters, dealing with some of the special attacks available, so you'll have an excellent foundation for the duels. Mortal Kombat veterans will notice that the game speed has been reduced compared to its predecessor. There is no sprint button anymore and the duels are generally a bit slower, which also emphasizes the tactical side of the hectolitre screen-blooded battles. On the way to the finishers (which, by the way, don't play a role in the story and are only possible in the other modes), good timing and recognizing the combos are still important in order to set the block. And with two more elements, fights that were thought to be lost can possibly be bent over. The massive ""Krushing Blows"" with X-ray settings are triggered automatically, but require certain prerequisites for activation such as counter situations.
		
		Even more important are the so-called ""Fatal Blows"". These are possible as soon as the life energy has fallen below a certain limit and, if successful, can rob the opponent of more than a third of his total energy. However, they must be used with caution. Because they are only available once in battle. If they are blocked or you don't hit them because you don't have the right distance to your opponent, you can make a new attempt after a short time - if you survive that long. If they survive, they are not only an effective means to leave the loser's road. They are also almost as spectacularly staged as the finishers. 
		
		Oh, and: Fatal Blows, Fatalities, Brutalities and even some of the Krushing Blows seamlessly continue the series tradition with their completely exaggerated and sometimes even black humorous violence. Where Mortal Kombat is written on it, there is pixel blood in it - in masses. Just as it always was and exactly as the fans want it to be. The fact that the limits of good taste are sometimes shaken is good and important - especially since Ed Boon and his team are aware of the self-ironic tone that is also transported in the story. Within the game world also absurd situations are credible.

        [td][b]Tech[/b][/td]
        [td]The integrated benchmark with subsequent performance evaluation aims for a constant performance of 60 frames per second, which in Mortal Kombat 11 must be maintained for a consistently fluid experience. If your system achieves less FPS in the selected detail level, the game suggests a lower graphics level. In addition, a total of ten graphics options can be fine-tuned manually, which have several control levels and are explained with helpful(!) reference texts.
		
		What is irritating, however, is that certain scenes - such as Fatalities, Brutalities and Fatal Blows - have been limited to 30 FPS. This doesn't result in a drastic loss of quality, but the trained eye will notice the difference in the midst of a tug-of-war. 
		
		Mortal Kombat 11 also only runs at 30fps for the menus and the exploration of the Krypt, in addition the performance in the bonus level goes to its knees as soon as you use a higher graphics setting. On medium power it works better, but some muddy textures turn out to be more frightening than any fatality. The online mode worked without any problems in my test, neither longer loading times nor too high latencies were noticed.
[/td]
    [/tr]
 [tr]
        [td][b]Conclusion[/b][/td]
        [td]Mortal Kombat 11 is great. A celebration of scope, presentation and content for single player fans. Especially the partly foreign shameful staging of the not too short story, which offers something new for veterans as well as newcomers, convinces me almost in every part of the series. Mortal Kombat 11 doesn't have to hide from its predecessors - even if some of my favorite fighters didn't make it into the game. I found it a bit cheeky that they were waved around in my face during the campaign. But well, in case of doubt there will be DLC supplies. But I have less indulgence for the microtransactions. They are not indispensable for the complete gaming experience, but they make the grind noticeable in a painful way. It will be exciting to see how Netherrealm is improved here. Furthermore, the re-design of the costumes of the female characters annoys me. While the male colleagues often slap their opponents in the mouth very half naked, many female fighters are only one step away from the full veil. We are not in an Arab dictatorship, dear developers. Next time please less burka and more fan service. Regardless of that, Mortal Kombat 11 could beat its way into my heart. If you have nothing against a few rough bells, the latest title of the Beat'em-Up series is the best choice.

Those who have a lot of crashes, bugs , i don't know what could cause them , the game runs perfect for me! I pre-ordered the game almost emediatly after first trailer- NO REGRETS AT ALL!
 Now couple of thing that made me rage: 1) Some characters,like Sub-Zero and Liu Kang, can't be punished when they are in the right hands, maybe its my lowskill ,but it's more likely that these men will get a nerf!2)The time when the game came out for a PC- at 20:00,23 april and even then we weren't able to launch Mortal Kombat, because of those 60 gb that we pre-loaded -THEY HAD TO INSTALL FIRST-_- and you can tell that im a fool and the speed of downloading and installing depents on your system and internet speed - SO I'LL ANSWER YOU - NO,NO,NO!

37,50367122,english,"First time reviewing a game, and after spending about 30 hours in it so far, Mortal Kombat 11 is certainly earning the attention.

I have a back'n'forth history with fighting games. Played a LOT of MK2/3 back in the day, dabbled in the rest of the games, played a lot of Street Fighter 2, Injustice 2 and a couple others. Fighting games are not my primary genre, but I enjoy casually playing through them when I get the itch to do so.

The trailers got me hyped enough to buy the superdeluxeomg version of the game. And honestly, I'm glad I did. But while there are lots of ups, there are also lots of downs. Here's what's on my radar...

Ups:

1. The actual fighting is excellent. I like that rushing has been de-emphasized in favor of more thought-out tactical approaches. Kombos are rewarding, specials are fun, fatalities/brutalities are as awesome as I'd expect from a Mortal Kombat game, and there is a surprising amount of depth, nuance and intricacy in the fighting systems. I'm not sure I like the fatal blow system over the xray and other systems they've had in the past, but I've adjusted and enjoy it just fine.

2. Aesthetics are phenomenal. I can't believe a MK game can look this good. The music is fantastic, the voice acting is excellent (well, Ronda Rousey's parody of Sonya Blade was a horrible mistake, but that's my only complaint in that department), and the overall look and feel of the game is the best it's ever been.

3. Lots of game modes. Many towers and tower types, AI battle modes for lazylols, the best implementation of the Krypt I've ever experienced (I've spent hours in there already), daily challenges that are fun enough to compel me to actually do them, and of course, lots of online battle options, including team fights (which I haven't tried yet). Plenty of stuff to do.

4. Customization is actually pretty cool. It's not over-the-top detailed, but being able to swap out a few peices of gear that affect the visual appearance as well as the performance of the fighter is a cool system. Provided you can get your hands on them, you can equip items that do things like remove Frost/Kitana/Skarlet/etc masks so you can actually see their faces. There are a handful of outfits for every fighter (with a lot of color variations for each one). I've always liked having an element of control over appearances of characters I play, and this system allows me to do that.

5. The story was excellent. They've really ramped up the lore since MK9, and while they've gone off the rails a bit here and there, I thought the story in MK11 was great. Kronika makes a great antagonist, and I'm hoping we somehow see more of her in the future (I'm also a Jennifer Hale fan, so that helped).

Downs:

1. The grind is absolutely absurd, bordering on human rights violations. While the Krypt is really fun to explore, the random nature of the chests, paired with the astronomically high costs to open them, make getting the customization options for fighters that you actually want nothing more than a pipe dream. Unlike previous games, the chests can't be mapped out, as the placement of chests is randomized for each player (heart chests, however, are static, and there are already guides on which ones contain stuff for what fighters). I've already spent over a half-a-million koins, even resetting chests, and have barely made a dent in any fighters cosmetics collection. I STILL have only aquired the second fatalities on 3 fighters, and I'm pretty irked that things like fatalities are locked behind this grind. 

2. Politics, unfortunately, has invaded MK in a bad way. The SJW nonsense that has infected so many other developers has made it's way into this game, and has resulted in a removal of decades-established content (iconic outfits for female fighters), as well as 'retconning' of a few fighters (*cough*Jax-woke-slavery-nonsense*cough*) to appeal to leftist game review journals in a transparent effort to score a few cheap social political points. You'd think developers would have learned by now that the people who scream and cry about sexism/racism/representation/whatever don't even play the games they are complaining about, but it seems NRS didn't get the memo, because they made some obvious efforts to pander to those people AT THE EXPENSE of the core fan base. Big mistake that will hurt them in the long run, imo.

3. Tower difficulty is roflworthy in its ridiculousness. You can earn 'consumables' (which are buffs and modifiers that you utilize in tower matches) to accentuate the game, but in most of the Towers of Time, these consumables are flat out mandatory if you want to make any real progress. The modifiers on the tower fights make many of the fights completely impossible to beat for an average joe gamer like me, and even when I get too frustrated to play and decide to use the AI fighter capabilities to do the fight for me, the fight can STILL be unbeatable unless you have the exact particular consumable to counter whatever affix is the problem, which you likely won't have unless you've been really lucky with drops/rewards. The randomness of consumable drops makes it impossible to target the ones you need, and thereby make it impossible to get passed some of the Tower fights. Supremely frustrating. It feels like they tried to upgrade the Multiverse system from Injustice 2, but fell flat on their face.

4. There are several fighters that we are missing in the roster. I know we can't have every single fighter that has ever been in Mortal Kombat in the roster at the same time, but to leave out notables like Reptile, Mileena, Smoke, Sheeva (rumored to be released in future DLC, along with Nightwolf, Shang Tsung, Sindel, and others, but still), and others feels like an oversight, especially since the story is so 'timeline' oriented, which would lend the possibility of bringing back fighters previously killed in the story. The roster definitely needs a lot of additional iconic fighters to really make it feel like the Mortal Kombats of yore.

5. Some shady business tactics. Frost is obtainable by playing the story mode, but the game doesn't tell you that while trying to sell access to her for $6 on the in-game store. Very underhanded and cheap way to nickle and dime people who already payed a lot of money for the game. So far, the rest of the micro-transactions (yes, they are in this game) are for things you can already earn in the game, but the problem is that earning those things takes a ludicrous amount of time, so they seem like they are pressuring you into paying for the shortcuts. The currency used to buy these things isn't exactly the cheapest real-money currency I've seen in a game. I'm sad at NRS for going this route. I would've thought they had more respect for their player base than this.

There are lots of other things that can be talked about, but these are the things that stand out to me the most. If you're strapped for cash, I'd hold off on the game for awhile, see if it goes on sale. If you get headaches from rolling your eyes at cheap political stabs, I'd have some Advil on standby. If you don't mind spending the money, the core game itself is amazing and fun. It just loses luster when you get into the end-game grind to fully flesh out your favorite fighters. But ultimately, as much as I'm enjoying it, I can't recommend people buy this game, and that's due to the shady business practices in play here. I'm tired of the gaming industry trying to take advantage of gamers. I was a fan enough of the franchise to buy it on Day 1, but I'm not sure I would have had I known the extent of the greed that seems to be on display here.",1556445528,1556446018,False,4,0,0.510227620601654053,0,True,False,False,76561198011249008,80,1,6063,31,1832,1601390188,,

However, sadly, the more I play the game, the more I realise there is a treacherous under current that forces you to grind for very little reward simulated in a ""walking loot box"". I can forgive this...I know this is the way games are going at the moment which in itself is rather tragic. In fact, I actually don't mind the grind if the player is justifiably rewarded for their hours of play, a compromise if you will for your loyalty versus lining the developers coffers.

But I reached my limit today with the towers of time. I understand that the developers are addressing the issues associated with the difficulty level in this part of the game. But as it stands, the towers are simply not enjoyable say compared to Injustice 2 Multiverse Challenges. The fact that you need to pay your hard earned currency obtained by grinding to even start some of the tower challenges, and then get paralysed/dominated by the AI who is RIDICULOUSLY buffed out is not fun.

72,50360286,english,"MK11 is good, but it has [u] a lot of problems. [/u]

The gameplay and new systems are smooth and rewarding. The pace has been slowed down considerably from MKX and there is more of an emphasis on spacing. It all works well and I'm excited to see how it pans out in the competitive circuits. The roster is great, a huge step up from X. The music and presentation overall have been vastly improved. Fatalities are pretty good across the board and the sound design is great, as always.

The issues however are numerous and prevent me from totally enjoying this game. The towers of time are absolute cancer. Seriously the worst mode NRS has ever put into one of their games. It's a grindy, unenjoyable mess but it's the only viable way to earn currency and cosmetic items. There are so many skins and customizable options for the fighters, but they are all locked unless they just so happen to be one of the eligible items you can claim in the towers of time. It's ridiculous. I actually quit mid-tower to come write this review because I was so frustrated. 

Another way to earn items is through the krypt- which is also a bust. Unlike other games, the chests are randomly generated so you'll spend currency on items you would never want. Currency itself is very difficult to come by without grinding. Your character will likely never have the appearance you want them to given the randomness in acquiring cosmetics, which is a real shame considering all of the effort that went into the skins and gear. 

All in all- pretty poor launch NRS. You know something is wrong when there are four types of in-game currency. The game didn't even unlock for PC players until ten hours after the rest of the world received it. Why do they hate us so? If they address the grind-fest and blatant encouragement of micro-transaction purchases, consider this a thumbs up.",1556405976,1556405976,False,5,0,0.540832340717315674,0,True,False,False,76561198089123908,179,11,12431,0,1203,1599119772,,

One thing I never got over with Mortal Kombat was the series transition to 3D with MK4. I tried to like MK again with Deadly Alliance, I gave it another go with MKvsDC, and then with MK (2012), but the games although not bad, they just lacked the attraction I had with the original and that's the realistic looking combat and characters.  MK11 finally breaks the mold of not so great looking 3D.  This game does what I been begging NeitherRealms to do for years and that's go for the best motion capture detailed character look i.e. (the Mass Effect style) and they finally did it with Mortal Kombat 11.  The game looks like you're playing real life, much a kin to the original 2D classics.   But it doesn't only end there.  The story mode of this game is better and well written than the 1995 Mortal Kombat film. I found in disbelief that I was playing a Mortal Kombat game seeing so much high cinematic caliber being nicely mixed into combat.  Now the fighting,  perfect integration into the story mode cutscenes that I ever seen done in any video game to date, at first I had issues with the characte movement from the previews looking off, but as I rewatched a UFC match I realized NeitherRealms even did their homework there on capturing realistic movement.  Long time MK fans you won't be disappointed as the violence in MK11 goes to another level with many different HQ styles to do on your opponent.

I say definitely get this game for PC if you have decent/optimized hardware.  I seen a lot people complain with problems, but I bet they didn't optimize their PC.   If you were one of those with issues, reinstall Windows.  I seen a lot of PCs get slow due to Microsoft's sloppy work with releasing untested Upgrade Builds that slow and break the usage of Windows.  
2. install the latest video card drivers, run benchmark tests with 3DMark software here on Steam and tweak your PC to its optimum performance because this game deserves no less.

Pros: 
Great Fighting gameplay
Fan service story
Online runs smooth
Can be played casually or Professionally
Cons:
GRIND!!!
Towers take to long with their difficulty
everything cost so much, and currency is hard to accumulate. 

Thoughts:
The game is lots of fun, the story took around 4 hours to complete and online is a fun distraction. There is a currency you earn with lvl up that can be bought in the store; however this currency CANT get you all the skins you want. Ironically since the towers are so hard, I almost wish they allowed me to buy hearts(type of currency) in order to open chests in the kryt. The game doesnt suffer from lack of content, or microtransactions; this game is more time consuming then anything. For me to get anything i would have to do godly hard towers that after an hour go away. You can you cunsumables to give u an edge but everytime you decided to change characters instead of retrying, those consumables are consumed. I found that I would make the AI do all the fighting up the tower and setting its behavior to kombos and rush. So after watching your godly AI fighter fight another AI fighter, i feel like im watching more then im playing just to finish towers in a timely manner.

Having said all that, Ed Boon has said over tweets that this issue will be RESOLVED (thank fucking god) and everyone will get a gift of 500,000 Koin, 500 Hearts, 1000 time krystals ($10 currency). This game is really good and i would encourage everyone to wait till they resolve the issues a bit more, But just to clarify. There is NO mircrotrans that will help you in anyway; they only give quick fatalities (for noobs) random rotating skins in the store(typically 3 skins in the store at one time). I Think after 40 hours I have a good idea that this game is getting some bashful criticism and review bombs from people with less than an hour. This may be due to the launch for pc being rocky and i was experiencing crashes from time to time, and haveing the krypt be locked to 30 frames was odd. But I still believe this game is worth the money i spent.

--------------------------------
MK11 is the latest entry in the mortal kombat franchise.
Gameplay, story and content wise the game is fantastic on all those levels.
There is a issue with the amount of grind in it as of now.

The towers of time are hard, and it takes a long time till you get a reward.
But i will ignore that for now, and give you my opinion from a gameplay, graphics and story perspective.

Gameplay wise its a huge improvement. Easily one of the best mechanics in anny mk game as of now.
Adding the mercy back was a nice touch. The refferences make me as a mk fan smile allot troughout dialogue and Krypt moments.

Graphics are also a huge improvement to the other games in the franchise the game looks fantastic, the stages look more allive than ever. Characters look great, and most of there designs are fresh and fantastic.

Story wise the game takes a huge change. It was, for me at least, one of the better ones in the MK franchise. The ending made me chear for a certain character (not going to spoil).

I will leave this game with a possitive review, and i hope there will be changes made to the progression system.

Enjoy the game, and GET OVER HERE !",1556381966,1556381966,True,4,0,0.531778395175933838,0,True,False,False,76561198035391503,558,179,5828,0,1104,1595695998,,
4,50338230,english,"I am writing this negative review for one basic simple reason: once you beat the Campaign (which is excellent, btw), the replay value of this game is null. The problems stack up like this:

If you want cool skins, you need currency to access the Krypt. If you want currency, you have to play through either the Klassic Towers, or most particularly, the Towers of Time. In the latter mode, you will face enemies that receive special, unique bonus effects to help them present more of a challenge.

Those effects are *wildly* overtuned. Even with the purchaseable consumables, you will not be able to best them using your normal game skills. Some of them are possible to work-around, albeit clunky (the effect that freezes you slowly on contact with the enemy, for example, is an annoyance but you can use kick combos to keep the enemy away while you defrost). Some effects however, are simply gamebreaking - one of them allows the enemy to call in an Erron Black, for example, and you have not experienced true misery until you've watched your character be wailed on for 20 seconds straight because you never once had the opportunity to do anything that round.

Finally, the game requires a full-time always-online connection. Even the slightest hiccup on your connection, and I shit you not, you lose *all* of your progress on whatever tower you were working on - even if the game acknowledges that the server has seen you win. On top of that, the MK11 servers are not 100% reliable, so expect after an hour or two of gameplay, you will simply be unceremoniously kicked off.

Oh, and if that wasn't enough, this full-price game has microtransactions, and it also has lootboxes - because yes, there are lootboxes - which you have to endure a pretty relentless grinding process in order to earn. Party foul, Netherrealm. Get out of the house.

The Krypt is a boring half-baked ""game"" where you run around for literally hours with hammer smashing things for coins. Towers of Time is a game mode where you fight CPU characters in totally stupid unfair scenarios and winning fights is based on using items you earned in the totally boring Krypt game.

Let me restate this; the game requires you to beat Story Mode to unlock certain characters too but the Story Mode is UNPLAYABLE due to sound desync issues from the messed up framerate. Devs are NOT addressing this in their last updates either.

17,50351244,english,"I am not sure where to start. I can say that I have been having so much fun playing this after 20 hours. I figured the pc port would come with a few bugs. Towers of time are going to be corrected by next week according to Kombat Kast. I thought the story was really well done. I love the new combat mechanics. The slower pace makes you have to use a bit of strategy based on who you are fighting. Examples would be some characters are more combo based and up close. While others may be better zoners and jugglers. The counters if done correctly can really turn the tide in a fight. I also thought that the combos are a little more fun to pull off in this one too compared to Mortal Kombat X.

I am aware that many are upset over the microtransactions. I look at it like this. There are a lot of games I got as a kid or teen. They came with expansion discs that you could download to your hard drive. Examples Mortal Kombat 3 didnt have Scorpion originally. But Ultimate MK 3 did. Everyone bought it and nobody complained. Dynasty Warriors also had a disc you could add more chars and weps to the base game. Rock band sold discs as well to add more songs.

The days of physical disc copies are gone. We have reached the digital age. I look at it the same regardless of how I buy any add ons for games. It is a fighting game at its core. At least there are modes to keep us busy before getting burnt out. Most fighting games just have story, online, and arcade mode. That's it. I know everyone is entitled to feel how they do about their purchase. I was just trying to address the negativity. Because to me so many people jumped the gun for so many negative reviews. It's a really good fighting game with a few issues. Microtransactions are not a must, they are cosmetic. In an interview with Ed boon he stated that the Fatal Blows would run at 30fps due to the effects that take place during them.

I would recommend this game based on the fact that it is very fluid and fun combat. Has online that runs well. Amazing story, Evolving challenges the keep things somewhat interesting. If you dont like the idea of costumes ya dont have to change em. I like the augments and consumables to help turn the tide in the Tower and that your characters gear actually gets slots to use them.

The main issue for people seems to be microtransactions, i.e. that cosmetic / for show stuff requires either grinding or paying to unlock in the crypt.

Been grinding the game for 5 days now. I have unlocked almost NOTHING for my mains - not even one brutality. Just a couple of skins. On the other hand, I have unlocked a bunch of things for characters I'm not interested in. Whoever gave the idea for random boxes in the Krypt, should be fired too.

Instead of enjoying the game, I'm watching the AI play in ToT so I can unlock at least ONE brutality for Kitana.

Still waiting for the FUN to be patched in. Oh, yes PC version is a few patches behind. As usual...

42,50310371,english,"Apologies in advance for the long review.

After finishing the story, and playing some private online matches, I would say this game is better than MKX and there are some things I wish they didn't change from MKX. Examples of the changes I liked was removing the running and stamina system (My opinion, though. Most people like this system, but I am a noob, so I didn't like this system), and the changes I wish they didn't make is the block and EX moves are different buttons now. I might get used to it, but I was nice to have both in the same button. 

As for the story, story is good expect for the ending which felt a bit bizarre to me, and the character roster as of now is very good. It's almost easy to learn almost each character. The mechanics are not hard to learn which makes it easy for newcomers to the MK franchise or the fighting games in general. I am a newcomer myself to the fighting games, So I'd definitely recommend it to people who want to give this genre or the MK franchise a try, but don't get it at full price. 

As for the bad things about this game, The microtransaction problems and the performance issues. I don't really care about those because competitive mode disables all gears anyway and I don't mind grinding. So, if microtransactions bother you, think a bit before getting this game. But like I said, it won't affect anything if you play competitive versus. And I heard the devs are changing the system a bit as well, so there's still hope. And performance issues, I mean which game doesn't have performance issues at release these days? But I'm sure they will fix that as well.",1556161601,1556348652,True,20,5,0.580334722995758057,0,True,False,False,76561198166642707,143,24,18102,97,505,1601406519,,

I have been playing for 3 days and I did not master a single character. You can customize them , all the moves and abilities are available exept fatalities.
All those people who talk about microtransactions are just following a trend, the trend of critizicing microtransactions.
But when you have a game with loads and loads of content, it is not a fair critique. 
If  I ever reach the point that I master at least 4 or 5 characters I know I will unlock a lot of content without paying a cent more.
Story mode is awesome, on line matchmaking is awesome, the game seems to be designed to play online wich is even more awesome, and servers are working fine from day one, and I am in south america where the only game that servers work fine is rocket league. First time in my life I can enjoy a ficht game online!
The gameplay is perfect, no broken characters, no unfair or stupid mechanics.
Developers have made a master class of how to lauch a game following community advice and critiques.
They have listened to pro gamers critiques during beta, like the deep analisis that sonick fox made like a month before launch.
I do not have time to talk about history, music, graphics, design, everything is awesome and loads and loads of content.

If the All Mighty Ed Boon wants to put microtransactions for stupid rat kids, or whinie little btchs who do not have the patience to understand and master the depth of a fighting game, he deserves to do it. 

All little brats stop the whining , come online and I will brake your bones without a fancy skin, just my skills!

Now, I've thought about this review for a while now, and I definitely think I can recommend the game.  There are some small trifles about the ""SJW"" content and the microtransactions, but first, lets talk about the gameplay.

The gameplay seems to be a whole step above MKX's.  While MKX was great in design for beat-down style brawler action, many of the characters play-styles eventually morphed into various forms of either rush-down or grappler with very little in-between save for a few zoners and one trap character.  MKX was a great fighting game, mechanics wise in the top 5 with UMK3, MK2, MK9 and now, MK11.  MK11 slows down the break-neck speed of MKX by just a smidge, decreasing juggling, shortening kombos, and removing the run function, allowing characters more time and space to utilize more complex and subtle strategies.  On-top of this, you now have two seperate bars for recovery (Defense) and EX-moves (offense) which recharge separately and can be used separately.  This widens gameplay and creates a more precise way to strategize.  As well as changing the EX-meter, you now can perform FATAL BLOWS once per match which do huge amounts of damage to the enemy, when you are down to your last 25% or so, no longer linking them to your meter and their one-time usage making strategy even deeper than before as you contemplate whether to use it this round, or the next.  The gameplay is some of the deepest and most refined that Mortal Kombat has ever seen, challenged only by the likes of MKX, but as I've stated, I think MK11 overall improved on MKX's mechanics, keeping the identity of Mortal Kombat in check, expanding on previous mechanics, and improving flow and depth.

As for the stages, they seem to be more static than in MKX's, where you always had something going on in the background, from wolves lurking in the forest to people building up the new Kotal Arena, to now a courtyard of dead monks, or a prehistoric forest.  A lot of the maps in MKX were very heavy on shading and shadows, utilizing ambient lighting to create moody, dark atmospheres filled with vibrant life, although MK11 has some of that too here and there like the ship in the blood sea, or the beneath Kotal's Arena with all animals and creatures, or Kano's Arena which is definitely a stand-out.  There are also more maps in MK11, and each one offers its own distinct mood and setting, which, while I think MKX's maps were more ""alive"" than MK11's as a whole, MK11 still retains a high quality of map design and has a number more.  The end number of stages in MKX was 14 which while high, is a large amount less than the, I believe, 21 maps that MK11 offers.  Overall, I would give the edge to MK11.  It retains a good amount of the vibrant life that populated MKX's stages, while expanding significantly on the number of them, and with balanced amounts of interactables.

The roster is also spectacular.  We have Noob Saibot, Kabal, Skarlet, Jade, Kano, Jax, Shao Kahn, Cyber Frost, Baraka, Kitana, and a number of returning characters from MKX, as well as 3 newcomers.  It all seems relatively balanced, although it could benefit from a little extra flavor.  With the incoming DLC, this roster shows great potential to be one of the best so far.  MKX's roster was pretty decent, MK9's was great, and so far MK11's could be one of the best of all time, up there with UMK3.

Now, about the microtransactions.  First off, there are next to none.  The only currency you can buy are time crystals, which you can spend on skins and items in the store that switch out after a certain amount of time for something else.  Everything that you can buy with the time crystals can be unlocked in the krypt, it simply is a grind to get enough currency (Hearts, Soul Fragments, Koins) to unlock anything that everyone is complaining about.  The devs plan on increasing pay-outs from matches and rewards, and giving all owners of the game free extra currency in order to buy things in the krypt.  Now with that said, the next thing.

SJW nonsense.  People are complaining about Jax's ending, which I will admit, is inconsistent with his character (especially so when Kitana's ending shows a gaping plothole in how it's handled that makes you wonder why that wasn't a part of Jax's), but overall, it's not that big of a deal, especially since it's non-canon anyway.  The ""burqa"" that Skarlet wears, is not a burqa.  It's a sun shield hat that everyone wears in the desert, since she's from Outworld, which as far as we've always seen, is mostly desert.  As for the ""no skin"" costumes, there are numerous skins that you can unlock that show significantly more skin for all the characters.  Skarlet's character even has a few costumes that give her character a ""boob window"" ala Power Girl.

All-in-all, a great entry into the MK11 series, and hopefully one that's remembered for some time.  As we apparently shift into the ""new era"" of Mortal Kombat that awaits us.",1556340469,1556340469,True,1,1,0.404239118099212646,0,True,False,False,76561197979961681,807,129,6118,0,932,1596673103,,

53,50343936,english,"Look, the problems that most of these recent reviews have covered true and limit the potential of this game. Krypt is a unique idea that is interesting but the frame rate being locked at 30 and the abysmal rate at which you gain currency makes it feel like it has a mobile game monetization model. The towers of time are an interesting idea but the AI are borderline unbeatable without the consumables (which are found at the krypt). The story of the game is fun but i experienced a desync with the voice and facial movements but other than that no other issues. The saving grace of this game is its combo system and the 1 on 1 combat in general. Having played SFV and killer instinct the combat is really rewarding and feels smooth. Overall i think that people are focusing on the solo play aspects of the game too much, especially because this is a game designed for PvP not PvE. The grind is bad, this is true, but if you are looking for another fighter game to play ONLINE and not just play solo it is a great game with a fantastic combat loop.

TLDR; If you are a casual player only looking to play the game singleplayer either wait for sale or hope they change their monetization model. If you are a competitive player looking to play multiplayer and dont care about cosmetics this is a great multiplayer game. Single player 3/10. Multiplayer 9/10.

54,50343916,english,"God really? How do you mess up a game so bad especially with all the hype surrounding its release. First of all, the whole ""customization"" crap is complete garbage that just give P2W players a massive advantage. MK should be based solely on the skill of the player, not how much extra money they are willing to spend to make up for their lack of such skill in an already $60 game. I do praise this game for retaining the fun combat mechanics from previous games, but the single player challenges might as well be impossible. I don't care how skilled you are, you're not going to beat a boss with double health while bombs and missiles are launched at you every 2 seconds, ones that do TOO MUCH DAMAGE by the way. I literally can't even stand up without being knocked back down with 30% of my HP gone. Might as well make the boss do triple damage and have knock back immunity, it sure as hell won't make a difference, you're still going to lose, miserably. It is incredibly frustrating to take down 9 opponents with ease then to be met with an impossible difficulty jump and forced to restart from the beginning. Even after the supposed ""difficulty change with towers of time,"" it is still impossibly difficult. Considering that not even a game update has changed this problem, I am not entirely optimistic for the future. Another issue is the seemingly lack of support for keyboard local multiplayer. Connecting a second keyboard doesn't seem to do anything, only letting it control the first player at the same time as the first keyboard. MKX did this perfectly fine, there is no reason why this game is not allowing it.

70,50342678,english,"Mortal Kombat 11 is one of the greatest fighting games ever made, and contains what I think is the best story of any Mortal Kombat game to date, and any fighting game ever made.

MK11 has an incredibly rich story, featuring a slew of characters, new and old, and offers great insight into past events occurring throughout the old storyline and the new storyline. Kronika is a very fresh take on an old formula; the unplayable big-bad from arcade games of old is back, which although is a bit disappointing since she's such an incredible character, it truly adds to her depth and power seeing her as something you can fight, but can never be.

The Krypt is an awesome take on what was once a stale way to get a quick jump scare, or some background info on character and environment art, skins, and more. The Krypt now features an over-the-shoulder 3rd person adventure game feel, and urges the players to complete puzzles and explore hidden areas to get rewards that we can only speculate what they are.

The only current issues I have with the game are Towers of Time, and the way the game was ported for PC players.

Towers of Time is something we see adapted from Injustice 2, and is a way for players to try challenging towers with modifiers and increasing difficulty levels for unique rewards. However, the current state (which is being worked on) is pretty broken in regards to how badly the player gets demolished by repetitive AI Modifiers, and over powered opponents that double your damage, predict your moves, and spam Modifiers, Assists, and combos. 

The PC problems I have are common, and rely in framerate, anti-aliasing problems, and crashing. The crashing has been addressed in the latest patch, as have *some* anti-aliasing problems, but the game doesn't run nearly as pretty or smoothly as it should on Ultra settings. 

Overall, if you're a fan of Mortal Kombat, or fighting games in general, I strongly urge you to play this game and explore the amazing story that MK11 has to offer.",1556328596,1556328596,True,0,0,0.456140369176864624,0,True,False,False,76561198038597644,31,1,6409,0,2015,1590689369,,

-Juggle combos are more difficult to pull and there is no Breaker.
-Damage is decreased to introduce ""Krushing Blows""
-Krypt boxes are random?
-Time Towers are are almost impossible and require you to use ""konsumables"" which you earn by playing the game and is RNG too.
-Sub Zero, Scorpion, Jax, Young Sonya and Skarlet look uglier. (i'm talking about their faces).

Maybe it's a good fighting game but it's a bad mortal kombat game.

Female characters are all covered up to a degree that feels awkward. The final boss has some areas where you might see side-butt but her butt glows blue to shield you from anything feminine. There are a few okay looking female faces but for the most part they've made the klassic netherrealms faces that are so ugly you'd rather a skeleton. Frost looks best because they covered up half her face and kitana doesn't look bad. Might be better if they went full burka. A lot of characters have had their body proportions reduced to a degree that makes them look like large todlers instead of women. It's honestly a little uncomfortable.

6,50315226,english,"Pretty disgraceful how this game has been shipped, especially on PC.

Issues:
-The PC version has constant crashes for the vast majority of consumers. Everyone I talked to had at least one crash. Some crash when trying to record AI in training mode, some crash every time they try to enter a match, some when trying to customize characters. The version is very unpredictable and unstable.
-The PC version is behind on patches from the console version, which is pretty typical for NRS games, but should still be mentioned.
-Online disconnects happen galore for no apparent reason.
-The game is built like it's a mobile game. Day 1 we have a store with microtransactions, dailies for currencies, insane grinding to unlock anything, etc.
-Towers are a staple of Mortal Kombat games, but have never been this butchered before. Of all their games, including Injustice 2 which was their last released game, none had towers that felt like they were explicitly designed to exploit the player. As you go deeper into towers the AI opponents get incredible amounts of health, read your inputs like there is no tomorrow (which in itself should not be the kind of AI we still have to deal with in 2019), there are traps and rockets flying all over the stage which only hit you but not the AI, etc. To compensate for this you are apparently supposed to use items that restore your health and buff you in different ways, further making it seem more like a mobile game where you are supposed to run gacha for consumables.
-Speaking about gacha, that is exactly what the Krypt is this time around. In Mortal Kombat (2011) the Krypt was a bonus to give you little extras to unlock. Every chest had something of value and you could easily find out what you would get in each. Now the Krypt is this ridiculous third person exploration sidegame which expects of you insane amounts of currency to open chests - the chests being a dice roll in what you actually get from them.
-This all adds to it feeling pretty insulting that even players who pay full price for both the game and the season pass still get an incredible amount of content locked behind exploitative grind and micro-transaction baiting.
-The gameplay has taken a hard hit. The roster is the same size as that of Mortal Kombat X, and while the exclusion of series staples like Mileena is debatable and subjective, the objective fact is that you still get a lot less for the same size. Characters have been stripped of complexity and options, with matches feeling very samey quickly due to the limited option of tools at hand for each one. Some people might argue that Mortal Kombat X had a few too many difficult mechanics like the way the run cancels worked, but this game's basic roster and gameplay is even below the complexity of Mortal Kombat (2011). The new variation system also seems underdeveloped and confusing, since the two preset variations you get for singleplayer and casual play are not the same two you get to choose from in competitive play/ranked.
-Another small gripe is that characters don't have multiple intro and outros anymore until you unlock them through tedious grind. The same goes for your second fatality and brutalities.

All of this doesn't mean that all is bad. The core gameplay is still fun and satisfying, it's a good looking game visually, and it has a decent amount of content overall (although it still feels inferior to both Mortal Kombat X and Injustice 2). This does not excuse at how the game feels crippled in almost every area to apparently account for an in-game store and microtransactions. The Krypt got randomized loot, the towers an incredible push in difficulty and tedium, and characters have half their ""fluff"" locked behind Krypt and towers. It is a far step down from the quality of the previous two games, and the state in which the PC version released in doesn't help this. The game is still violent, for people who enjoy that, although it is a lot more prudish than before - for whatever reason.

Take that as you will, but in the state of its launch the game has so many problems and baffling design decisions going on for them that a recommendation should not be given to anyone.

EDIT:
Additional commentary about how unfair the towers are after further playing on launch week:

It is actually stunning that someone thought that the way the towers were balanced way okay. Even when using items these are ridiculous. Sometimes you can completely shut off some really annoying modifiers, but those items are rather sparse. The towers don't even offer closely to enough rewards for the time investment you need to put into them, and how much stuff they throw at you.

Two examples of towers I had that baffle me they made it into the game:
1. Tower with darkness effects that cover your screen:
Basically, every fight has some rule where your screen goes dark. Example: Standing near the opponent, or getting hit by something that blurs your vision for a period of time. This is annoying but fine, yet the final fight of this just jumps to absurd levels. The final fight has you completely shrouded in darkness, basically playing Mortal Kombat by sound alone. Of course the opponent still reads your inputs because any kind of innovation in opponent AI is not to be found here.
2. Tower with blood rockets shooting at you:
This was a Skarlet tower that had me lose my mind completely. Every few seconds you get a rocket sent at you. These rockets deal incredibly high damage and are unblockable. This means that if you were in the middle of a combo, or the opponent forced you to block, and suddenly a rocket goes right at you, there isn't much you can do. This would be bad enough, but with the enemy AI reading your inputs, most often trying to jump over the records will get you hit by an anti-air, sometimes sending you back into the rocket for even more damage. And if that isn't enough, every time a rocket hits you, the opponent regains a good chunk of health. Wait, not enough annoying crap thrown at you yet? Right, for some reason the enemy also has triple the usual health and will immediately punish you if you try to teleport (which seemed like a good strategy to evade the rockets). That someone thought this was a properly balanced, fair, and more than anything ""fun"" thing to play through is beyond me. And this tower was labeled as ""medium"" difficulty.

Mind you, this also all comes from someone who played every major fighting game of the last decade, and most on a decently competitive level. I have a great track record against other people online in Mortal Kombat 11, yet the idea of playing through towers scares the hell out of me. How some newcomers to the franchise or fighting game genre are supposed to get through this or find any enjoyment is beyond me - especially since this should be the major mode to play for casual players.

It doesn't matter that the developers promised that this will get patched to make it better. Just the sheer audacity to release it in such a state is baffling.",1556194957,1556305425,False,12,0,0.580065667629241943,0,True,False,False,76561198063837980,842,25,8079,685,1087,1602003157,,
7,50337917,english,"This a great follow up to Mortal Kombat X, just a bit of a rough start with most PC launches. I don't blame Neatherrealm for that. The mass of angry sheep on steam is a little high at the moment and so the thumbs down has kind of lost its potency. Most of the complaints are about the DLC and I can understand that. It is a little confusing why Frost would be DLC when she can just be unlocked in Chapter 4 of the Story mode. Besides that hiccup, I can accept all other forms of DLC Neatherealm has issued out since these games are quality and take longer to make then releasing an unfinished game like other Devs. do. They take their time with it because they are passionate about their work and anyone can see that if they took the time and tried to come up with their own opinion once in a while. A quality game takes longer too make so ofcourse DLC is a necessary evil so that studios like Neatherealm can continute their passion. 

MK11 brings in some new characters and returns some fan favorites, but ofcourse people will see issue with this if the roster doesnt perfectly match up with their standards. For me personally, the roster is very unique and varied among its cast. 

The Story is a very unique take on the MK universe and will leave long-time MK fans in awe. Although one complaint of mine would be that some characters who play a major role in earlier chapters seem to fade away and take a seat on the bench as the story proceeds.

My favorite part about the game is the equipment and ability setup. Its takes the variation idea from MKX and furthers it. Its very interesting to see your favorite characters in so many different ways and to your choosing as well! Its a great idea by Neatherrealm and I expect nothing less from them when it comes to keeping their game fresh.

Towers ofcourse make a return and are as fun as ever, especially Towers of Time.

I also would like to point out how crazy the Krypt is this time around. Sure their may be a little RNG aspect to it, but nothing a little grind can't help. I think it is a very interesting take on the Krypt and would love to see it again in future games.

My complaints are minor and are shadowed by the positives of this game. However, they are there and it is only fair to point them out. A funky launch on PC is to be expected as it is a more difficult port. Frost DLC is a little confusing and I can see why people have a problem with it.

In short, MK11 is a great installment with unique additions to keep it very fresh and anyone could tell that if they took their time and look passed the minor flaws. This one is a must-play for any MK fan. Once again, Neatherrealm delivers and I can take pride in another work of theirs.

A tiny patch was released today after 5 days. PC version still doesn't have day 1 patch that PS4 and XB1 have. Different frame data different moves and bugs and issues make it impossible to practice / do competitive play as your move sets are different than the actual game.

I gave them til Friday to get parity with console. It didn't happen. I'm not waiting around to get boned like i did with MKX for a year+ of a broken game. So I am refunding at this point.


EDIT:
Kombat Kast was today. PC was not addressed and I believe it was a banned word in the NRS chat on twitch...

They have 1 week to address PC users or I'm refunding as its clear they're going to pull a repeat of MKX and abandonware us for another year.

I haven't yet going to sit and think a bit more. Don't really want to play more than 1.8 hours cause I can't refund if I do so I need to take a bit of a wait and see but it seems a lot of people are in agreement with me.

Why I don't like this game:

Confusing gear / skill loadouts:
These gear loadouts being different from tournament  / practice / and online is annoying as hell.
I just want to play liu kang and do bike kicks fast punches and look cool, but some modes and builds don't have those skills and those builds aren't default in others so I have NO idea whats legal and what isn't if i wanted to play in a tournament or not. 

I shouldn't have to put this much thought and work into wanting to just play a game and enjoy myself

Multiple Cash Currencies:
You got coins and some space age crystal shit that plays into a microtransaction predatory currency from what I've seen. Not a big fan of this and the fact I have to slave labor away to try and get outfit unlocks. I should be able to buy what outfits I want with the points I earned - like in Tekken 7 or Soul Cal 6.

THE GOOD:
- Very extensive tutorial mode, explaining the mechanics in detail
- Story mode is cinematic and fun
- Game fails to render Kano's chest hair correctly, making it look like a swarm of flies landed on his chest
- Stable performance (Geforce GTX 970)
- Very challenging, in a mostly fun way

THE BAD:
- Tower modifiers range from inconsequential to absolutely ridiculous, making some Towers of Time almost impossible to beat for somebody of my intermediate skill level. Very frustrating.
- The grind. Most things in the Krypt will take many many koins or hearts to unlock, while the rewards you get from playing seem quite small. Add to that the random loot, and you will have to spend untold hours just to get finishers or gear that isn't even for your favourite character.
- Customization. Injustice 2 gave you free choices of outfitting your fighters with lots of gear. Here you get 3 accessory slots and one ""outfit"" slot, feels a bit restrictive, plus most of the gear can only be gotten through the Krypt. Grind alarm again.

All in all, I would definitely recommend the game, but hoping that the balance and reward system will get patched. The fighting mechanics and actual game play are fantastic and will keep me entertained for a long time to come.

The story mode is a decent ammount of Kontent, and the multiplayer net code is freaking sweet. 

the biggest problem everyone is having right now is the progression system to unlock all of the extras, and by extension the relative difficulty of the towers of time. 

Currency progression for hearts is just straight up ****ed, taking 250 hearts to open up one of the chests, and you earn them at a rate of one per fatality. Koins are a lot easier to get, but most of the boxes give consumables for towers of time. 

the towers of time are hillariously hard unless you have the right consumables, which makes kollecting all the things you want a massive hassle. That being said, some towers are not so bad, with two of the towers that randomly popped up for me so far having been super fun experiences. 

If you can tolerate the blatant attempt to scam people out of their money, behind that is what could have easily been the best mortal kombat since 9. its a crying shame. i want to reccomend this, i really do, but at the same time I dont, because of the bad business practice.

23,50335814,english,"TLDR: This game is solid and isn‚Äôt as microtransaction heavy as a lot of people are complaining about. Yes, the current build of the game requires a lot of time investment for the Towers of Time but in the Day one patch (which at the time of this review PC has yet to receive) does make playing towers better.  However, unlocking items is still annoying and there is no punishment for rage quitting (get ready for a lot of that). I will break the rest of the review into mini sections.  The only reason I do not recommend is because they are leaving this game in an awkward state without patches for much too long.  If this patch only affected the towers I would say ‚Äúsure, grab it because the online is pretty good‚Äù but no, this patch also affects hitboxes, which can give certain characters infinite combos. (not that I came across this online but the fact we are playing a broken copy is absurd, not to mention Boon said PC might get different patches so who knows what is going on anymore)

PC Port:
The PC port for the most part is pretty good.  However, it is lacking important patches and seems to have some trouble running on other machines causing lots of crashing, weird UI, and some features that are just broken like using tournament presets for your custom fighter.  You would press the button, but it won‚Äôt tick over it is weird, this feature works fine on other platforms and the lack of day one patch makes doing the towers a CHORE!  The in-game graphic settings are really nice though, sorta wish they existed on the console versions.

Gameplay:
It feels more like Injustice 1 with a bit of 9‚Ä¶ I personally like it and you can do some QTEs during the Fatal Blows to try and get some extra damage.  One thing I am not a fan of is that the Fatal blows or crushing blows will go down to 30fps and this is a trend across all platforms. It is a design choice and I don‚Äôt really get why.  Fatal blows on average last about 13 seconds and you are going to see at least 2 a fight.  There also appears to be little to no damage scaling from what I could gather, which only makes using these more advantageous (for example I can make my combo go from about 300dmg to 500dmg with my fatal blow on the ready).

Online:
It runs better on PC than my experience on PS4 but I blame this more on how many PS4 users use a wireless connection‚Ä¶ I also really enjoyed the benchmark feature ensuring that everyone you play with will have a stable internet connection.  The PC really does offer a better display when picking a match as oppose to the limited information that you get on the consoles.

Microtransactions:
Yes, they do exist but weirdly.  Skins will appear in a rotation and so will a brutality or two but for the most part you really can‚Äôt just buy something you want.  While I understand people‚Äôs frustration of the microtransactions I also don‚Äôt see how they are implemented in a scummy way either.  The only scummy thing I saw was Frost was for sale for like $6 when you could unlock her fairly easily in story mode‚Ä¶ Skipping cutscenes I think it took me at most 10minutes?

39,50333396,english,"General consensus for singleplayer content so far: 

Solid game with some really awesome visuals, but the Krypt is an absolute mess. You have to grind a lot to get any cosmetics that you want.

I mainly got this game to play singleplayer. I actually really enjoyed the loot box system in Injustice 2. I felt like it was way easier to unlock cosmetics, because you basically get guaranteed gear for your characters after completing the ""towers"". A few hours of gameplay got me a handful of cool stuff. It felt somewhat rewarding in that game. 

Not in this game. Completing towers does not guarantee cosmetics for your character. You can only earn in-game currency that you can then spend in the Krypt for a small chance to get character gear. The price of the loot in the Krypt goes up each time you open a new chest, which means that it gets to the point where you basically have to spend a lot of time collecting what's left of your money to unlock a box that can contain useless junk. Some of the concept art you can unlock is cool and all, but I want to get some damn cosmetics for the characters that I like to play. It doesn't feel right when I spend an hour or two accumulating just enough money for a few chests to get a couple still images.

I'm really disappointed, because character customization was one of my favorite parts of Injustice 2. I wish they handled that feature a little better in MK11. I love being able to change the look of my character when I play, because cosmetics can sometimes change the feel of the character for me.

Until they improve or change how the progression works, I cannot recommend this game from a singleplayer standpoint. I can't really speak for those who don't care about cosmetics or singleplayer in general. I think the gameplay itself is fun. Haven't tried multiplayer yet, so I have no input there.

Pros: 
-Good Game Story
-Tutorials tht explain the mechanics even tutorials for the individual characters
-Good and Balanced Combat
- Interesting concept of AI Team Battle (Online)
-Awesome Graphics

Now the worst Of This Game
-Horrible Concept Of the Krypt
-Plain MicroTrasanctions
-Plain Pure Luck Chests (lootboxes) Forget What They Say , the moment u open a chest and is based on luck it is a FUCKIN 
  Lootbox
-Pure And Unforgiving Concept Of Towers Of Time, it only rewards if u use Konsumables or are Pure lucky on the fight
    -The Ai was more advantage than U , the abilities or advantages are completely on a different level than the ones u can 
     have or obtain
    -It doesnt reward skill , so forget it doesnt matter how good, u are gonna get trashed by stupid factors
    -  The rewards or koins are not worth the time and effort
    - It literally tells u to spend money to skip fights or obtain advantages
    - It Literally doesnt bring challenge or fun on this mod, Stay on Klassic Towers mod
- No decent rewards system so u can keep on to complete towers
- The most sad aspect it tht even the fatalities are unlockable and depedent if u find on the chests
- The supposed bonus unlocked on items of costumization are just confusing and the items are random so good luck tryng to find wth u need 

To my conclusion this game is not worth buyng at full price, if u are interested forget it, wait like previous game for full complete edition or real big promotion, it is sad because the concepts they show are interesting but they ruined with microtransactions mentality,

[h1]In-depth:[/h1]
There is a good game here. Somewhere. It is, however, very well hidden behind it's glaring issues.

Let's start with the one that affected my personal enjoyment the most. While the game itself runs perfectly at 60 FPS, the menus, the character intros and arguably the most important thing about Mortal Kombat, fatalities, run at 30. It looks very choppy, it's immediately obvious and it's just atrocious. This is the first Mortal Kombat game where I straight up don't want to use fatalities, because this ugliness ruins the whole match for me.

The other problem is the krypt. I don't even know where to start with this one.
I hated it in MK9. I hated it in MKX. But I never hated it as much as I do in this one.
Previously, you had to navigate this dull dungeon to unlock things. Things that were essential, like the aforementioned fatalities, because if you don't unlock it, you can't use it even if you know the input. It's already bad enough. But at least you could use the guides to find the chests you need in 9 and 10, so you unlock exactly what you want instead of random bullshit.
In this one? It's lootboxes. Straight up lootboxes with random chance of getting some crap. Seriously... why is this a thing?
But that's not it. They didn't just put random crap in it, stuff like boosters and modifier immunities (hold this thought, I'll be back with these later), but even the costumes that you can unlock aren't unique. Every character has 4 or 5 costumes. Each costume has 10 variations. And by variations I mean slightly different colors. So maybe you luck out and get a costume in your lootbox... maybe even for a character you wanted... oh... but wait... it's just a recolor. I don't even...
And by the way, did I mention that the krypt also runs at 30 FPS?

Ok. Now. About the arcade towers, as in, your main source of farming for krypt and most likely your main source of fun (aside from multiplayer). This time, arcade has modifiers in it. Say, random homing missiles that attack you. Or a place that drains your meters and gives it to opponents. Or just fire from the ground. It would be fine if it worked on both you and your opponent. But instead, they are only harmful to you. This is not the fun difficulty. This is incredibly frustrating. And it's made this way for one purpose only. To make you use the aforementioned modifier immunities. Which you can get randomly in krypt. Good luck getting the one you need.

At this point I'm not even gonna bother mentioning the failed launch of this game, crashes, roster that was cut to hell, extremely dull outfits etc.

This game has a fun story mode with good voice acting, a decent tutorial, acceptable fighting mechanics... and hey, it has custom lobbies at launch (learn from this, Dead or Alive :P ).
Fix the stupid 30 FPS fatalities, remove this dumb krypt and I can probably forgive everything else. But until then, this game will get no positive review from me.",1556076772,1556270342,False,317,7,0.725209653377532959,0,True,False,False,76561198003771261,571,71,1131,0,253,1556403257,,

The first 4 fights didnt really have any, but fight 5 the opponent had more health then me, fight 6 they had burning DoT punches, 7 had a stamina drain and 8 had the most annoying one of all, the screen would go completely dark whenever they swung, so you had no idea what was coming or what was going on. I wouldn't call that no modifiers. 

Why didnt I leave if it was so bad? well because you get no rewards if you don't finish the whole thing, and I already wasted time starting it. And the only way to slog through it was, you guessed it, using consumables to boost my self through.

The story was actually rather good, better than MKX by a long shot. But once you beat it, there's no reason to go back. 

Always online for single player content.... why? Seriously, just why? 

A forced woken narrative breaks the escapism I'm looking for in video games. Seriously NRS, make video games, not political statements. In case you haven't noticed, America is pretty much 50/50 split on politics, so any statement you try to make in your games is only going to pizz off 50% of your audience. 

GRIND GRIND GRIND.... want to unlock anything... prepare to grind until you scream, toss your controller through the dry wall, and drop kicking you TV to straight hell. Towers of Time is a joke! A plethora of unblockale off screen attacks and a magic AI that can seemingly read your mind makes it completely unenjoyable on any level. Then to rub it all in, you're reminded you can buy skip match tokens in the store after every loss. The whole thing is clearly balanced to discourage you from playing and make you consider buying alt skins and gear from the store with real money.

What do you have against fight sticks NRS? You can't use konsumables with a fight stick unless you're on a PC and want to make complicated macros with JoyToKey. This is because konsumables are mapped to the thumb-sticks and there is no controller shortcut to use them. Further more, certain enhanced specials don't work using the 1+2 shortcut... Baraka's enhanced Chop Chop for example. It refuses to enhance with 1+2 like all his other moves, you have to use the dedicated enhance button to make it work.... annoying! 

Bugs... I expected bugs and I got them.... some wired trippy trailing effect on the hair of characters with beards and body hair, Kano for example. Tried all kind of setting the hair always renders a bunch of after images and comes out looking like a blurry out of focus blob. The Kronika boss battle always slows to a crawl.... like 10-20 FPS only when the 2nd summoned characters joins the fight. I also tried many different graphics settings, the game always lags when the 2nd summoned fighter jumps in. Tons and tons and tons of crashing and restarting the game... I lost count... at least over 50 times in 18hrs of gameplay.

Now for Steam..... not releasing the game at Midnight like every other platform, and not clarifying the issue until 1hr before release.... POOR DECISION! Then when we could finally play the game 13hrs after the rest of the world, we have to site through a nearly hour long unpacking and install.... PC master race huh? I'm pretty sure this is my last Steam purchase ever.

Overall, the game didn't live up to all the hype. Wait for a Game of the Year Edition or a huge sale. As it is now, it's not worth the price of entry.",1556257065,1556257712,False,8,0,0.478737831115722656,0,True,False,False,76561198141846008,20,1,26991,50,1131,1601981678,,
78,50327981,english,"      I feel like the game was afraid to be Mortal Kombat.  This game is devoid of any real soul of its former self.  Mortal Kombat is a fighting game riddled with silliness but since 9 has had a compelling story and since 1 has had some fun lore.  This is not the Mortal Kombat you remember, the story was lackluster and ruins some of the best characters. 
      Microtransactions are a serious problem.  The game is grindy as hell if you don't wanna pay.  It takes the fun out of the exploration of the Krypt.   
      Many people are upset because the game has more half naked men than ever before but there has never been a more clothed group of women in a fighting game.  I couldn't care less that the women had clothes.  I just wish the devs would have given the men clothes too then.  But there is something to be said about Mortal Kombat losing its identity by trying to make itself more acceptable in today's society.  25 years ago, Mortal Kombat embraced the fact that it was not accepted.  That is how it won our hearts.  But through pandering it will lose its biggest fans.  
      The story is sometimes cheesy good and sometimes cheesy awful.  Sonya's voice acting is particularly awful but most of the cast is great.  I am not sure what happened there but other people seem to have heard it too.   
     The game just isn't well optimized at this point.  Maybe they will throw some updates at us soon but I think I am done playing regardless.  I will never finish the Krypt because I refuse to pay for the microtransactions.  It will bother me as someone who obsessively finds every collectible in games like this but I have to vote with my dollar.  I haven't lost faith in NetherRealm as a whole, I think they just need a slap in the face to keep them from selling their souls for the next MK.

92,50312190,english,"The only redeeming quality of this game is the story, it's actually very entertaining. The fighting itself is an insanely flawed mess with bad character balancing due to the variation editing. Looks like NetherRealm bit off more than even they can chew here. Don't even get me started on how you acquire customization items for your variations. It's either you endlessly grind against a.i. on the Towers of Time for currency, to be used in the Krypt. Or you pay essentially $5.00 for a single skin of your choosing from the ""premium store"" , which only gives you about 5 or so skins to choose from for an allotted time. You see I wouldn't have a problem grinding if it was actually fun but I just have to cheese a.i. for 4 hours straight for maybe like 50-75k coins. Which brings me to how the Krypt works. It's basically where you run around as an unnamed character, opening loot boxes containing COMPLETELY RANDOM items including character skins, weapons and such, and keys to open more doors in the krypt. Then completing puzzles to open doors to more RANDOM loot boxes. Oh yeah there's well over 1000+ items in the game to collect.  Ed Boon literally promised us no ""loot boxes"" but apparently thinks we're all dumb enough to not see a blatant lie in the form of this joke of a scam. Word it how you want it but we're still gambling our time and money away into random customization items we might not want. Even if he was trolling us at this point it was an awful attempt.

As insanely frustrating as this all is I spent $60 on this game and didn't originally forsee myself wanting to refund it. I had no idea it would be this bad. I really hope NetherRealm and WB games realize the huge mistakes they made and make up for it somehow. The character balancing and gameplay can always be tweaked over time, but I don't know if I trust the devs and publishers enough to correct any of these monetization issues considering their history with these complaints.

Final verdict - an extremely flawed game that looked amazing in previews until you actually play it and see how much greed ruined nearly every feature and aspect of the game.

One example of this was a tower I was doing as Scorpion. It was rated as medium difficulty, great, easy enough. I made it through all of the fights near flawlessly but when I reached one against Scorpion, I messed up a mercy (I was trying to get a Krypt item) so I just restarted the match. What a mistake that was, suddenly the AI became hilariously impossible to fight. He was spamming moves and stun locking me, I couldn't recover.

***Pros:***
- Deep and accessible fighting system compared to most other fighting games on the market. Super fun to watch as well!
- Awesome story mode of epic proportions! I literally had to finish it in one go.
- Fun to play new characters among a roster of classic favorites with revamped character designs.
- Character variations add meaningful diversity. Although, there are only two variations for each character to begin with.
- Comprehensive tutorials explain fundamentals, high-level fighting game concepts, and character specifics very well. With enough practice, it's awesome to take on higher difficulties with all the in-game knowledge you get.
- Krushing Blow mechanics are awesome to pull off and provide a great gameplay experience.
- Able to run the game on 144 hz refresh rate. Makes each fight feel amazing!

***Cons:***
- 30 FPS lock during cutscenes, Krypt, fatal blow and fatality sequences.
- Story mode audio can go out of sync. Pausing and resuming the game will fix this.
- Graphics do not look as good as PS4 Pro version. Hopefully, there will be a patch for this.
- The Krypt is really grindy and seems out of place.
- I would not say this game forces microtransactions. However, getting cosmetic gear is a huge time sync.
- Apparently, PC batches are behind PS4 patches. That's a bummer.

Pros: 
Game play- Fluid, fun and a breath of fresh air. The footsie oriented play style is fun and less attention to combo damage makes this mortal kombat a thinking game instead of a rush down 50-50 combo that eats 45 percent mid screen.

Kustomization: Making a swaggy character is always fun we can all admit that

Story: Glad to see a fighting game actually care about story.

Cons: 

Port/Crash issues: I run a respectable Pc which i made specifically to play heavy games with large processing and graphic stress. The reccomended requirements are a joke if you dont have an i-7 core and a more than decent gpu I would avoid this game at all costs. Nrs has proven time and time again that they simply dont care about making a functioning pc port. Even tho i have a high caliber pc I still experience crashes even after following a list of fixes. its honestly insane.

Krypt: honestly wtf. The grind to find variations and cosmetics which are all rng. The blatant cash grab is disgusting . Who in their right mind puts grind mechanics in a fighting game. I play warframe and this seems on par on level of grinding with significantly less reward.

Graphics. Frame drops all over for no apparent reasons not a big deal but it really bugs your eyes after a while.

The developers at nrs should take a page out of games like tekken 7 which has an amazing port and never crashed on me after putting hundreds of hours into it.

What can I say i was a fool to believe nrs gaming cared about their pc players which is odd since fighters see more longevity on pc.

The games current state  is not reccomendable. I will be refunding it via steam and play it on my ps4 even tho its grindy at least it doesnt crash on console. hope my review helped

The Good: 
+ Great character roster
+ Tutorial mode is pretty nice. IMO, it's really fleshed out. Could be one of the best fighting game tutorials out there....
+ Gameplay feels like it'll fit nicely in the EVO lineup

The Not-So-Good:
- performance is slow, even on minimum settings. I own an ASUS GL553VD, 16GB ram, i7. with a GTX 1050. It shouldn't be performing this bad.
- the microtransactions (and the backlash against the playerbase for calling out the gameplay that favors microtransactions) is a Public Relations model that I cannot support financially. 

Verdict: A very promising fighting game, plagued by a less-than-stellar PC release and incompetent PR management...I'm not recommending that you never buy this game. I am recommending that you wait 2-4 weeks to see how NetherRealm handles this situation.

All the issues that people are complaining about in the reviews to make it ""mixed"" instead of generally good are pretty BS. This game is great, and everyone is complaining about micro transactions or the Towers of Time difficultly. Keep in mind, all these issues were on day one, and have been fixed. They lowered the prices on Krypt items, and all DLC characters apart from ones from the fighter packs and Shao Kahn are unlockable for free. Don't listen to the bad reviews. Don't believe me? Here's some fixes made:

At launch, the difficulty in the Towers of Time was too high, and people felt it was unfair. And unfortunately, that made the process of earning rewards through the Krypt seem punishingly slow. 
 
The game was never designed to encourage in-game purchases. NetherRealm doesn‚Äôt make games that way. We do not artificially drive people towards in-game purchases.
 

The difficulty of the AI and the aggressiveness of the modifiers in Towers of Time was tuned too high. We‚Äôre aware of it and we‚Äôve already taken steps to fix that. 

Through a server update, we‚Äôve reduced AI maximum health and adjusted the frequency and cooldowns of many modifiers. In addition we‚Äôve made many unblockable modifiers blockable.

We are also working on a patch as quickly as we can to address several other factors, including increasing currency rewards and tweaking other modifier values that couldn‚Äôt be addressed in our tweakvar update. We‚Äôre shooting to have the patch out this week, early next week at the latest.

There are some things in Towers that are meant to be very challenging. We are trying to cater to many different types of players. Right now, everything is too challenging, and that wasn‚Äôt the intention.

As for the store, we want to stress that none of the in-game currencies (Hearts, Souls, Koins) are for sale. You also cannot buy Konsumables or Augments. You cannot purchase anything that impacts gameplay at all. Only cosmetics (including Easy Fatalities), and Time Krystals are available in the store.",1556241277,1556241277,True,3,0,0.48041236400604248,2,True,False,False,76561198353460797,43,17,10974,0,3107,1565212639,,

First let me say the graphics are killer, and the story is pretty cool thus far.

What takes away from this MK feel here is those stupid slow motion Fatal Blows/X-Ray moves during the middle of a fight that look like fatalities.  The original fun was to play a fast-paced match without interruptions and perform a fatality to kill your opponent at the very end.  Now the fatalities don‚Äôt seem as rewarding.

26,50305023,english,"Don't know if there is any point in leaving a negative review when steam will just claim it as a ""review bombing"" but I'll add my 2 cents anyway. I'll be brief.
Story Mode: It's alright, though I wish they would give more rewards for completing it
Online: What was promised (custom variatons) was delivered only partially (no custom variations in ranked) and they removed most of the mix ups from the game and slowed down the speed of the game.Some might love it, some might not but it is what it is.
Offline content: Now here is the main problem of the game. They said that there will be no lootboxes but turns out it's even worse.60$ game is treated as a Free to Play with it's endless grind and RNG.The Krypt that was supposed to be a fun and interactive way to obtain cosmetic items was turned into some ungodly child of greed and absolutely no respect for the player.Countless amounts of boxes that contain useless random crap like icons and materials instead of gear, demotivate me to play this game.Want to do anything? Pay up with one(or several) of ten currencies that we've created and that you have to grind for.And where do you get those currencies? That's right, in Towers Of Time or some crap. So the basic premise is that it's a formation of one or several towers that you have to clear out to get rewards(which are not even worth the effort most of the time).Sounds easy enough,right? Wrong! Not only AI has from 150% up to 400% hp there is always some shit  on the screen that constantly stuns you or knocks you down.How do you fight this bullshit? With your own bullshit and these ones are called Consumables.That's right, straight out of some mobile MMORPG.The end result is an uninspiring grind in frustrating matches against an AI that just fills the screen with projectiles (some of which are unblockable btw) and stage hazards.Oh and the best part is the amount you get for all your trouble is like 20K while a single chest in The Krypt costs around 5-15K and I'm not even talking about other currencies like soul koins,blood koins and items that you need to open certain doors.Obtaining gear in this game is a chore and in no way entertaining and does not teach you how to be better at the game, instead it teaches you to buy your way to victory with cheap stuff and spam.Thank you for the lesson.Oh and you get almost no money from online,other modes and even custom AI that has only one purpose(to FARM for you) nets you almost nothing.You can see that there  was a lot of effort put into creating those cosmetics,brutalities and fatalities but sadly it's hidden behind a wall of grind.Things like that demotivate me to play these game or even support it.
So do I recommend this game? No, business practices like this  have no place in fully priced fighting games.Feels like devs wanted to add lootboxes but after the backlash that Battlefront 2 got, they pulled out lootboxes but the whole system was already built around it.NRS usually listens to the their fans and I hope they will do so again.You should keep your money untill they fix this mess of a game.",1556130495,1556238821,False,524,10,0.830141961574554443,0,True,False,False,76561198058871071,395,6,2883,0,760,1556897362,,

31,50324556,english,"TL;DR : Looks gorgeous, very good sound, gamefeel is the best out of every MK game and overall fantastic, bunch of kharacters and kustomization. Great Kore gameplay. Difficulty on some kontent is busted and kurrently waiting for a much needed patch.

Too Long;Did Read : Pretty solid game, bit of a rough launch but nothing that kan't rather easily be fixed through a few patches. The game looks gorgeous, it feels very nice to play, move, punch and kick, fatalies/brutalities are still getting more gruesome and that's fantastic. Some of the kharacter interactions are pretty funny as well (pre-fight disses, Kano being a disgusting boar, Johnny's fatalities, everything Cassie does and say etc...)

Kustomization is completely fine (around 5/6 kostumes with 6-8 kolours per kharacter, from nostalgia nods to new redesigns). People komplain a lot about this but I'm frankly baffled by the komplaints : kompared to any serious fighting games released in the past few years (KoF, SF, DBFZ, DoA, possibly Tekken7 but I haven't checked it enough to say, etc...), you klearly have a bunch of neat-looking choice. It needs to be unlocked, but it's free (looking at you, Kapcom...) and plenty. Apparently one big komplaint from some players is that there aren't enough lewd/sexy kostumes for female kharacters... well, think of it what you will, but just know that we're indeed kloser to MKX than MK9. I personally don't kare one bit about that TBH.

Micro-transaction in the game are NOT necessary, NOT plentiful, NOT encouraged and NOT practical. MK11 is in NO WAY a pay to win.

Towers of Time (equivalent of a ""special Arcade mode"" to unlock stuff) are brokenly difficult right now, it's honestly nigh-unplayable for casual/mid gamers, and makes one think of SNK boss syndrome for nearly every single fight, so be warned ! Apparently this is being looked into with high priority and a hotfix should soon be released (writing this as of Day 3). The koncept is neat though, so once it's patched properly, I'm konfident it's gonna be pretty cool. For komparison, gameplay and balancing in the klassic towers (=klassic arcade mode) is absolutely fine with good difficulty scaling. The end boss is a bit tricky, like they always are, but it's... it's fine bro, don't worry. ATM Time Towers are extremely hard though.

The Krypt (where you unlock more content) is really gorgeous and a very original and pleasant nostalgia trip (movie, previous and current games references), but suffers from a balancing issue linked to the point above regarding Towers of Time being broken : in short, it requires severe farming ATM. The Krypt itself isn't broken though, you kan still visit it and open chests. And yes, indeed, you don't know what's gonna be in the chest, just like in previous MK games.

Playing on PC (duh) with a pretty good komputer (with low RAM, tho...) : it looks and plays super nice on top-ish settings. I don't check thoroughly for framerate because I don't give a s***, as I just play casually after work and for fun, but I haven't noticed framedrops so far. The game tends to krash in Kustomization menu though because it's running out of memory, so *CHECK THE SPECS* ! I'd only recommend either having 8Go and not running anything else (photoshop, mozilla etc...) in the background or just have 16+Go.

Bought the game for full price (60‚Ç¨) and I'm pretty happy with it.
As said, Towers of Time difficulty is kompletely jacked ATM (seriously devs, how was that not a P1 MustFix ?) and it IS frustrating, but it's the sort of issue that kan (and will be) fixed pretty soon. So see it as a rocky launch for a goddamn solid game. 52% is insultingly low for how fun it feels.

Pros:
- Game looks amazing, the gore looks life like, colors are amazing especally with HDR on, but I've noticed some flickering in the background when using it and some graininess on some charecters.
- Story is great but, feels short, and all the fights a lot easier than what the final boss was. Some area where audio was a head of the game, but not unbearable. Got black screen a couple times during cutscenes and couldn't see anything.
-The game fighting is smooth and feels amazing.

Cons:
- the game is awfullly unbalanced, especally towers of time, giving the AI huge advantges from posion rain, to slowing you down, or dealing constant damge to you while not blocking, including taking more damage from them, and dealing less to the AI.  Also being able to change difficulty as well is nuts. I don't know whos great idea this was, but it just God awful. This forces you to use consumables which guess where you unlock this from the Krypt. Not shocking but ill get to that in a bit,.
- The Krypt the worst thing about this game, it's bad and just greedy. At first you get good amount of coins and get decent souls, but if you think you'd be able to look up where things are, to get that spiecal skin for your main. Not a chance is hell. It's all RNG based. Alot of the time you'll be getting kunsumables for what you ask? Oh, yeah to balance out this games AI in towers of time. It's a money gimic, i bet they're going to sell the iteams or, sell gold souls, and hearts in the store shortly.
I've  used 12000 souls to open a chest to get just a few kunsumables, and paid 2000 and got skins. They are treating the game as if it's free to play. I feel it;s one of the mobile games you play to pass time, in like waiting rooms. They alreay have 4 out of 5 tatics of free to play. The only one there missing is ad banners and ads that pop up every few moments.
- Crashes the game crashes randomly and is very frustating especally during towers because you mus start over again. 
- requirment to stay online to do anyghing and to even unlock krypt iteam this is annoying and very underhanded and unfair to many players. You preatty much cant do anything with out a internet connection:/
-Desync online and offline
-audio off key randomly
-experinced audio that slowly lowers
- pay $60 to have to unlock 90 percent of the game
i got the premimum version of this game, and it;s good to play online, with friends, locally , and noraml towers but the game becomes unfair and not fun when playing towers of time and  running around the krypt to MAYBE unlock and iteam or your under meaning konsumable.
I recomend the game if you want to just have fun and play with friends, otherwise i wouldn;t spend the money.

(Ramble review warning)


I don't know if you can look up my past reviews or not, but I hated MK10.. Like Absolutely detested it. The game for me was a huge step down from MK9. It was graphically gorgeous but all the input timings felt terribly wrong and the story was down right insultingly bad, Playing mk10 was a chore and I just could not bring myself to play it again even though I had payed the largest premium for it. Almost double of what I had paid for mk11. I was ready to be let down by mk11 and would definitely write an angry review if it was that atrocious. 

Why is this important ? Because all those issues are *FIXED*

It is all about the fight for me. All about the gameplay. The gameplay is downright solid. Inputting feels so good. I don't know what they have done, but the controls are just way way way more responsive and easier to execute and chain. This just lets you focus on matchups and strategy as timing has a way more relaxed window.

And strategy is so beautifully designed here. There is always a way to do something and to beat a champion. There is so much thought put into it. 

The tutorial is downright gorgeous and one of the best in any fighting games of it's genre.

The story was fine. Sure there are moments you have to throw out the hat of logic for artistic freedom, but it is decently fine and after the abomination of mk10, finally ties up a lot of loose ends and just satisfies a lot of parts with really gorgeous artwork. 

I know people are angry about the Micro transactions and apparent technical glitches on certain systems. I haven't experienced any bugs myself, but that I am fine with. I don't know what the micro transactions are there for, but the truth is, I don't care.

The gameplay. The fight. The design behind the game and the character's input interactions for me are just so good. I don't intend to spend anything in the way of m.t., but in all honesty. I don't feel like I am missing out anything.

Look. the marketing and finance team for the company might be shitty af. That doesn't skew the view of a good game for me. If you like good fighting games and you're an avid MK fan, you might like this.

45,50323253,english," I haven't tried playing an MK game seriously for a long a while and I wanted to change that with this game. The core gameplay is a lot of fun. It's great learning combos and getting better with your characters but everything else wrapped around this game just isn't fun.

While the core roster isn't anything exciting, it does have a nice variety for just about anyone. Characters are fairly varied and fun to play. The story mode explored most of the characters to great detail and made them shine. Beyond that, the game is simple frustrating and too time consuming.

First off, the road to Gitting Gud is paved clearly. The tutorial and practice options are top notch. There are ranked and casual online matches. You can modify your character's attacks to fit casual play or you can play with predetermined styles for ranked. But if you want to change your character's cosmetic items or obtain gameplay changing Brutalities, you are at the mercy of the game's RNG.

The main problem with the game is that 99% of unlocks work like a long drawn out Free to Play mobile game. In the Krypt you use Coins, Skulls, and Hearts that are gained from fighting to open chests. Coins are fairly simple to get as they are the most common reward. Skulls are slightly less plentiful and are typically only given for winning. Hearts are the rarest. They are only given if you perform a Fatality or Brutality. And you only gain 1 or 2 of them at a time.

The contents of the chests are completely random except for Heart chests. Heart Chests give you a few items for a specific character once and only once. They can not be reset to give you you're desired character's items. You can find online maps telling you where your character's chest is located. Other than that, all other chests are completely random and there's no way for you to obtain your character's items or Brutalities except from pure luck.

The ""Best"" way to gain currency faster is to play Towers of Time. In these challenges you face opponents that have higher health and do more damage. That alone is ok but as the towers progress they introduce ""power ups"" for the enemies that break the game. These included unblockable missiles that not only do damage but can make you slow, stuck in place, on fire (you lose health over time), or simply freeze entirely. Earthquakes that cause your character to get stunned or lose large portions of health and get knocked over. Auras surrounding your enemy that slows you down, freezes you, or deals damage to you over time. To me a lot of these power ups added to the challenge. But the way they are incorporated, it makes the fights seem nearly impossible when multiple effects are stacked on top of one another. ""Luckily"" the game offers items you can use to fight back.

While you are able to use Consumables of your own that can help you win, they pale in comparison to what the CPU has. You also must obtain them at random and they have a limited number of uses. In my experience, the frustration of these powered up matches outweigh the rewards given. Your victory is determined through the sheer RNG of how the power ups work and what items you have available to you. I've been suggested using a particular set of items for certain fights but the game has not yet randomly given those items.

What compounds this further is that I wanted to  get better at the game while I unlocked items for my characters. But these Tower of Time matches do not teach you how to play the game. In fact, THESE MATCHES ACTUALLY PUNISH YOU FOR PLAYING A FIGHTING GAME LIKE IT WAS A FIGHTING. I've been punished for doing combos by slow down abilities that froze me right at the end of a combo allowing the enemy to combo be in return with their damage buffs. I've been KOd by off screen missiles while trying to play keep away from the enemy because they constantly electrocuted me for getting to close. I've been bounced into 50%+ combos for simply standing on the ground because the entire arena generates land mines at random. These challenges are not fun and do test your skills. They simply test your patience.

While I personally don't think the micro transactions are in your face, I can totally imagine players paying for Brutalities or Skins for their characters simply because either the game makes it too hard to obtain in Towers or just impossible to find in the Krypt. But even then your at the mercy of the Randomly Generated items they offer every 24 hours in their Premium Store.

Honestly if you want to play the competitive modes for an E Sports Experience, I encourage you to buy the game. But for everything else, I do not. It's too frustrating and simply random. I honestly choose not to believe they play tested any of the towers of time levels or the Krypt.",1556228453,1556228453,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198037563426,165,1,5631,0,1591,1578536992,,
46,50323089,english,"The Story is a ton of fun, pitting you against various opponents. You'll being playing through a story, following a time line with various different fighters defending Earth realm. You'll face off against many different opponents, to save Earth from a disturbed time line. The goal to stop a reigning boss of time, who's soul goal is to wipe history clean removing one particular character from history. This effects all known realms of Mortal Kombat, so you'll meet a large roster of fighters, both new and returning fighters from the history of Mortal Kombat. 

I played through on medium, without to must of a challenge. Later challenges of the games replay value, have proven to hard for me, as I will again consider myself a returning new comer to the series. I haven't played a Mortal Kombat sense Gamecude Deadly alliance. Towers of Time are overkill for new comers to the series, as you cannot select a difficulty. Though I think with some time and practice, some of the towers I could learn to beat. As for now I find difficulty playing hard modes, needing to learn the special skills and blocking mechanics of the game, before progressing into that content. Things move real fast, so it's something of a note to stick with Klassic towers, to learn characters in hopes to learn the mechanics better.

There are a few added futures, I think are amazing. Krypt being one of them, sort of telling a story of this game, though being a shallow way to find new skins and upgrades for customizing characters, looting chests and opening other goody packs throughout the Krypt. I don't want to say to much about this, as I think it'll spoil the fun to expose it. Experience it for yourself, as it's a amusing way to explore in the Mortal Kombat series. 

All in all I think the game is fun so far and plan to play more, as I learn the roster and mechanics. I am playing with Steam controller at this point, as the Razer Raiju PS4/XBONE controller was giving me blisters trying to use. I will attempt to learn the game well enough, to get into some more of the difficult content. I think if I give it up now, I will miss out of some of the more desired content.

57,50289379,english,"UPDATED: 4/25/19

TLDR: This is one of the best fighting games out there and it's only going to get better with time.  If you have any affinity for fighting games, you should jump on this and grow along side the community here before they get too good.  This game does NOT deserve the Negative rating it has right now.

Haven't dove into everything the game has to offer (yet), but everything I have tried is absolutely rock solid.  You can take this as a first impressions rather than a review.

UPDATE 5: Towers of Time is brutal and i'm glad the devs are fixing the difficulty because there is no way anyone can beat some of those towers.

UPDATE 4: Story mode finished.  I have to say it was amazing.  Not sure how I feel about Kronika in the end, she seemed more like she'd be better suited for Injustice than MK.

UPDATE 3: If you are a fan of MK's history and lore, the Krypt is incredible.  There is so much fun stuff in there that calls back to older games.  So many easter eggs that will put a smile on any die hard MK fan's face.

UPDATE 2: If you are worried about how long it takes to unlock Frost, don't.  You unlock her very early in the story at the end of the sub/scorp chapter (which is like 3 or 4).  It does not take long to get her.

UPDATE 1: Ronda Rousey does not do Sonya justice at all.  From what little i've heard from her in the story so far, she is very clearly not an actor and just sounds like she is reading a script most of the time instead of playing a character.  Not impressed by that and am sad because Sonya deserves better.

+ One of, if not the best tutorial in any fighting game ever.  They go over so much and do certain things to help you get better and learn what you are messing up on.  This tutorial is an absolute godsend and puts every other fighting game tutorial to shame.  You can go in with no knowledge of fighting games and come out knowing all about frames, punishes, kounters, timing, etc.

+ The game is gorgeous beyond any shadow of a doubt.  NRS really took the terrible faces from Injustice 1 to heart and have seemingly gone out of their way to make them look better and better.  MK11 has some of the best faces in any game ever and i'm a little scared what they are going to look like in Injustice 3 or MK12 or w/e comes next.

+ So much character customization and it's great.  I can't wait to see what stuff they add later for more crazy looking characters.

+ The Krypt is cool and more fleshed out in ways I wasn't expecting.  Running around, smashing things with the hammer and unlocking stuff is great.  I wish more games would let us unlock stuff like the old days.

Can't talk about this game without talking about the ""controversy"" and how upset people are getting with certain things.  I can't help but disagree with what MOST people are says right now.  I'll mention the things I agree with them about as well as the things I disagree with them about.

- (Agree) Microtransactions suck, but it's just something that doesn't seem to ever be going away.  This is modern gaming and we don't have much choice in the matter with these big AAA games.  Atleast it's not Pay 2 win...or full of loot boxes.

- (Agree) Kredits gain seems fairly slow right now.  After finishing the basic and advanced tutorials as well as opening some currency chest freebies they give you at the beginning of the Krypt, I had over 100K Kredits to start with (as well as some Time Crystals from finishing all the tutorial lessons).  Opening chests is fun and seeing what you get is fun, but there is no way to tell what you are going to get and some chests are fairly expensive, which sucks.  I will say that I unlocked more stuff in MK11 at the start than I did in MKX.

- (Disagree) Did everyone upset about the more covered up female characters forget that MKX was a thing?  We didn't jump straight from over the top/skimpy outfits from MK9 into the more realistic/acceptable outfits of MK11.  There was an entire game in between.  No one got upset about this when MKX did it so why they are getting upset now is beyond me (and those people can be easily ignored).  This also doesn't take into account that the game just came out and there is PLENTY of time to add stuff like this back into the game later (with how upset people are getting with it, i'm sure NRS was going to do this eventually anyways).

- (Disagree) I HIGHLY doubt NRS made the difficulty and kredits rate this messed up on purpose.  Again, the game hasn't even been out for 24 hours (to the public atleast).  They are already working to fix this right now.",1556053886,1556223352,True,35,7,0.44059067964553833,5,True,False,False,76561198030281831,603,26,2065,0,134,1584484306,,

68,50311169,english,"Pros:
- Tutorial system is excellent. It provides detailed, structured explanations to bring you up to a decent level.

- Graphics are fantastic! 

- Game-play is phenomenal, the flow of combat is extremely satisfying and smooth way better then MK-X.

- Fatalities are insane, the best in the series hands down!

- Sound design is excellent, punches and kicks sound satisfying alongside all the other weapons. Music could be a bit better however you rarely even focus in on it in the heat of combat so it's not such a big deal.

Cons:

- Varied framerates. 30 FPS in the Main Menu, Fatalities, Fatal Blows and Kritical Strikes and Krypt whereas the rest of the game runs at 60 FPS. This can sometimes be a bit jarring however I, for the most part, don't even notice it and in my opinion it does not detract from the flow of the game.

- Krypt: An excellent premise however the randomisation of loot and extremely expensive chests (13,000 for anything half decent) makes it so that you rarely get anything you want, with most of the rewards being items for the forge and challenge tower consumables rather than costumes and gear. Another thing to point out is that some items in the Krypt require currencies to use, mainly Kenshi's headband that requires orbs (which are used for crafting in the Krypt and are rather scarce to begin with) and eats them up at a rate of roughly 2 per second which is absolutely absurd! You get a large sum of Koins to begin with however once they're gone, and they go quickly mind you as everything is so expensive!, you have to spend an eternity to amass even a small amount! Not to mention the fact that YOU HAVE TO SPEND KOINS TO RESTOCK THE CHESTS IN THE KRYPT!!! as once you've opened them they don't refresh!

- Challenge towers. Sadly these once fun towers have been massacred by a horrid system that gives the AI unfair advantages, so much so that you are forced in some cases to use consumables (that you earn in the Krypt via RNG) to even the playing field. Which no doubt will be sold in the store at some point. The fact that the AI has the advantage of not only upping it's difficulty setting but also giving it modifiers such as bonus damage or acid rain that eats at your health makes the towers a chore to complete. This system in my opinion is absolutely rancid and I have no idea who in their right mind thought it was a good idea.

- Kustomisation: An absolute tragedy of a system, apparently borrowed from Injustice 2 (although I have never played it so cannot confirm) this system makes it so that you have to level up the gear that you wear in order to slot in stones that modify your characters stats in some way, be it bonus damage with a certain move or resistance to certain types of damage. Doesn't sound too bad right? WRONG! You have to level up EACH PIECE OF GEAR, so if you equip a new helmet you're back to square ONE!!! Also guess where all the gear/stones and skins are unlocked? That's right! the Krypt, so you have to spend HOURS grinding for Koins in order to even have a CHANCE at getting a piece of gear you want. Also you have to have the correct stone for the correct slot in that gear making the chances of having a matching set of stones for your gear EVEN SMALLER!!!

They've overhauled the resource system that's been in play for the last couple of entries.  No longer is it a game of trying to charge up your meter to use an X-Ray move twice in a match.  Now the X-Ray moves are called Fatal Blows, and they are only available for use once per match, and only when your health dips below 25%.  This adds a deeper element of strategy in when to use them and when to save them up.  Also, you now have a defensive meter and an offensive meter that recharge over time.  This allows you to bank those resources separately, using the defensive charges to slip out of combos and the offensive charges to power up your special moves.  This is a major improvement over Mortal Kombat X and I'm extremely pleased with it.

The character dialog at the begininng of matches is great.  It fits well with the lore of the game and some of the characters deliver some pretty great zingers to their opponents.  Great fun.

The fatalities are fantastic.  No amount of blood, guts, and humor was spared in them.  My reactions ranged from wincing to laughing uncontrollably, often in the same fatality.  This is the Mortal Kombat I've loved since I was a kid.  I'm glad to see that they are still kicking it up a notch with insane and unique ideas even after all these years.

Now for the cons:
The biggest one is the way they hawk their wares.  It really has an almost cringey, free to play mobile game feel to it when your loading screen constantly encourages you to go to the store and buy items to make tough fights easier or to skip them altogether.  Of course, nobody's forcing anyone to buy this stuff and I for one would never stoop so low, but it's annoying all the same.  No, I don't want to buy a ""Konsumable"" just because I lost the last match.  That's just ridiculous.

The second is the Krpyt.  Honestly, the Krypt is one of the things I disliked the most throughout the Mortal Kombat series.  You are faced with more treasure chests than you can shake a stick at, most of them containing pointless things like concept art.  Which is cool, don't get me wrong, but if I want to look at concept art I'm going to go online to do that, not dig through menus in game to look at.  I wish they'd take a hint from how Tekken 7 did their unlocks.  Make most of cosmetic stuff directly unlockable with Koins so you know exactly what you are spending and what you are getting, and make some of the more special stuff only unlockable through completing a difficult tower or something like that.

Finally, I'm having the issue several others are reporting where the game crashes to desktop suddenly and without any dialog box, usually when I'm navigating the menus.  It doesn't seem to happen while I'm playing the story, tutorials, or towers, so that's good.  Here's hoping they find that bug and squash it in a patch soon.

That's about all I've got to say.  I don't regret my purchase, and I love the game.  Get it, it's a blast!  Thanks for reading!",1556217426,1556217426,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198052918800,73,10,7160,0,834,1590893238,,

71,50301641,english,"I don't usually write reviews, but it's important that I write one about Mortal Kombat 11 because this game has put a very mixed taste in my mouth.

To start, let me just say that I've played MK9 and X and found them both to be enjoyable, despite X having a questionable roster. I have played some of the classic MKs as well, and those have always brought me fond memories. Because of that, I knew instantly that I would find enjoyment out of MK11, and I absolutely have. For me, the game is fundamentally a fighting game. The Krypt and customization do not sway me as much as the fighting itself does.

It's fun to fight as the characters available in MK11 and the campaign, so far, has been a blast.

However, NRS have lots of learning to do. LOTS.

MK11 provides a unique flavor of fun when you open the game and begin to experience it but it's slowly begins to change flavor with all of the game's discrepancies (that I have noticed). 

Here's a short list of what I've discovered:

1 - Terrible cinematic optimization on PC. Sound and picture don't line up. Dropping to 30 FPS during a cutscene is bad.

2 - Crashing. For some reason, my game will only crash if I spend too much time in the customization menu. Sometimes, the game will crash simply because I've opened the customization menu.

3 - The Krypt. I know this a hot topic already, but I'll put in my two cents. It's awesome and fun to explore, but I have no acquired a single item out of hundreds of thousands of coins that I actually want... I've been playing Noob, and he'll probably be my main but I didn't get ANYTHING for him. I got things for other characters that I'm interested in like Sonya, Cassie, Kollector, etc... but nothing for Noob.

4 - This is small problem, but I'll grill NRS for it anyway. You released the game on PC a whole, impractical, 12 hours after the initial release of the game for console players. While it does not sway my decision to play the game, it was a 12 hour span that I slowly became more and more angry that the game wasn't released. You cannot and should not announce a game's release date for all consoles at the same time and neglect to announce a separate PC release. MKX was treated horribly on PC. Don't make MK11 another sad story for NRS.

5 - Politics in video games. Another small complaint, but I see the political statements all over the place. I won't quit playing the game because of them, but it's boring, insane, and will come off as demeaning for many players who sit on one side of the political spectrum. Just leave politics out of video games.

6 - (Edit, 4/25) Until any patches are released, the Towers of Time are not worth my hardware. I'd rather not risk bashing my keyboard into my skull trying to defeat a mega-healthed Geras who is only on medium difficulty but has a modifier that helps him kill you. Also, why do I have to unlock towers midway through the content?

Anyway, I may change this review as time progresses and things change, but as of now, I do not recommend picking up MK11 unless you're desperate for some fun fights.",1556117140,1556214062,False,7,0,0.563492059707641602,0,True,False,False,76561198078969528,135,4,2316,0,333,1591113414,,

When it was announced, I was pumped. 21 Savage was probably the worst possible choice for trailer music, but I liked what I saw. I thought ""If Erron Black makes the roster, I'll buy the game.""

Fast Forward a bit, ""Yeah, it's not really as fast-paced as the former games. It's a more neutral heavy experience.""
""Uh oh, that's not what I want at all""

Watching the pros spam projectiles at each other with very short combos mixed in.
""Oh no""

""Yeah X isn't really a combo character, but here are all of the zoning moves they have lol"" Where X = almost every announced character.
""Oh noooo""

Jacqui, Kotal Kahn, Noob, and Erron Black are announced and look fantastic.
""Well I guess I'm buying the game now, but it still looks really slow and boring gameplay-wise.""

Shao Kahn is pre-order only, so that you feel pressured to buy the game before it comes out to have a complete roster. Shang Tsung is announced as DLC well before launch. And Frost is DLC, but also unlockable in game so that some people can be tricked into buying her, and they can make the excuse that it's optional.
""Yikes, that's WB for you. Greedy and manipulative.""

I don't want to get into the stuff about the towers and the Krypt. It's bad, really bad, and other reviews are addressing it.
""Another enormous red flag""

It might sound shallow, but the women in the game are getting less attractive every game, and the men are becoming more attractive every game. Have you seen Jax? By the gods, look at that man. And I'm sorry if anyone thought D'vorah was attractive in MKX.

This is a PC port, not a PC version, and a bad port at that. My game crashed before I could even get into a practice match to try out my man, Erron Black. I took that as my final red flag, and am going to collect a refund.

But at the current state it's impossible for me to reccomend it.

TLDR VERSION:

The game mechanics and fighting are top notch, but it's way too grindy to unlock the stuff you want for your character.


PROS:

- Graphics are insanely good
- Gore and blood have never been better
- Fast paced, great fighting
- Interesting storyline

CONS:

- Unlockables are all behind the RNG God of the Krypt
- Earning Coins, Souls and Hearts is tediously and obnoxiously slow
- The girls have been completely covered up but the men are still wearing loin cloths (double standards SJW bullshit)
- Game can randomly crash even with a high end computer


All said and done, MK 11 is a fantastic game but I had to work my way around to even start it because it would constantly crash after loading the splash screen.
What really puts it down to the ground is not the fighting, which is sublime and in perfect MK style, but all that surrounds it, from the obscene grinding required to unlock stuff to the impossibility of wanting to open chests that would contain what you seek really make the experience horrible.

Am I going to make a big deal out of the fact that the girls are now completely covered up but the men are still showing off everything? No, I am not... BUT... The words of the Art Director are more than enough to suggest that SJWs have made their way into Mortal Kombat.

In short, if they will reduce the costs of the objects in the krypt, allow us to unlock the skins and stuff we want, and give us the original costumes that made MK what it's been known for, I'm willing to change my review to positve.

The Krypt is by far the best out of all the MK games, it's enjoyable to explore the island and see the different lore moments/easter eggs in the game. The customization of the characters is worse then Injustice 2, but it's not horrible, it's nice to mix and match and kinda make your own looking Scorpion, Sub-zero and so on, granted most of the good options are hidden in the Krypt or in the towers of time.

Combat - fluid, feels good, solid fighting mechanics
Roster - a fair selection of old characters, the few new characters are good fun to play as - especially the kollector
Krypt - just play the game as you want, spend rewards here. Largely cosmetic stuff so its just bonus.
Towers - klassic towers to unlock character endings are as expected, towers of time has ridiculous modifiers that will annoy you. Towers of time will likely be something I only play a bit of here and there.

44,50312994,english,"I just had a 6-hour sit down with the story mode (Yes, it's beaten, I was on normal to get a little more story focus and minimal rage) And i'm very impressed. The combat feels a little better than MKX, almost a little more tournament-ready. Characters are pretty balanced, so almost anybody with any play style and pick it up and get good with some practice. 

The fatalities are somehow more brutal than MKX's, but also much more creative. One thing that i feel like MKX lacked was the creativity of the fatalities. MK11 Nails it on the head without a doubt. The new ""Final Blow"" system instead of the traditional Nether Realm ""X-rays"" make skill more of a necessity instead of waiting for this big unbreakable combo. Is it nerfed? Definately. But it is for the better of the game. 

Now, the story mode was something i was super worried about, given that the main protagonist was somebody completely new to the franchise, but holy hell, did they execute it well. The story definately  holds true to the Nether realm continuity, and does a very good job with the character development and clearly shows the importance of the roles of each character. The ending wasn't something that one would typically expect, in a good way. I'm satisfied enough that I don't feel starved for story, but I also cannot WAIT until the next installment.

Best port of any NRS game so far, 60 fps (except Krypt locked to 30 fps and Fatalities and Fatal blows) no dips, rarely the game crashes 
Best netcode in any fighting game i've seen so far
Good story
Great roster
Slow/Middle paced gameplay, footsies, quick decisions, you don't get juggled forever 
Amazing character interactions, face models etc.
The krypt is amazing (except the grinding)
Lots of customization
Lots of game modes
Good graphics
Very creative Fatalities, Fatal Blows
Lots of gore

Cons:
Very slow progression (you grind like hell for unlocks, can take up to 1-2 years to unlock everything)
Towers of Time is really unfair
The updates will be released slower for PC
KOTH lobbies freeze/lag whenever someone leaves (not an issue only on PC)
Sexism and lies (said women are covered up because of realism yet still they have high heels when they fight and men are half naked)

57,50293718,english,"I'm only about 3 hours in and this game and the story is quite fun.  I'm definitely enjoying it.  I appreciate that the story has about 2-4 minutes of dialog between each fight and transitions well between them.  Combat feels great as well.  I like the slower pace of combat myself.  Animation and graphics are fantastic.  Voice acting is fantastic too.  So far, I have not encounter any bugs during my play.

Honestly, it kind of saddens me to see so many outraged over planned microtransactions.  I can see that there are a lot of currencies in game.. but when I logged into the in-game store, there was nothing for sale.  So, I can only guess this outrage is for the planned transactions?

While playing the story, I felt like I was unlocking character cosmetics literally every fight.  From what I can see there is already a crazy amount of things you can unlock in the game without transactions.  I think I simply disagree with the hate on this one so far.

EDIT:
Beat the game in a little over 7 hours.  I think this is the best mortal kombat story I have played through.  Just fantastic and fun all around.

Only story mode gripe was that the last boss difficulty went to 11... after practically breezing through the entire game up to that point.  I spent 30 mins to beat her and was frustrated.  For me at least, spiking the difficulty did not bring any more enjoyment to the story or make the end any more epic.

I then logged into the Krypt section of the game and found it to be an over the shoulder run-around to unlock chests with coins that you get from playing the game.  I can somewhat understand some of the complaining around this as everything is kind of expensive.  But, to me, I think it was clear that the Krypt was to be the rewards for long term playing of the game (over months to years even).  You know, for replayability, which is a plus in my book.

At this point, I still simply don't understand the complaining or agree with the review bombing.  We just got an excellent mortal kombat game for fans of the series.",1556076809,1556172802,True,40,10,0.518030226230621338,0,True,False,False,76561197965344898,540,12,5408,0,191,1559492954,,

 - Online (haven't gotten to it, just finished the campaign)
 - Krypt and Towers (Dont mind a grind, but I still haven't gotten to it. But know that NTR said they will adjust it in a patch on Twitter if i remember)

75,50311209,english,"Man, what a wild fucking ride. Mortal Kombat 11, in its current state, is a mess. QLOC, try as they might, have failed in their current effort to bring MK11 up to par with its console cousins. Scratch that, the Switch version is a mess too, so it's more like their PS4 and Xbone cousins. Thanks to the way things work with QLOC and Netherrealm seemingly communicating through tin-cans, the PC and Switch versions are currently several patches behind while Netherrealm skates fast and eats ass to fix the utterly grindy and annoying progression system tied to the konsumable kanoodling Towers of Time. Meanwhile, the Krypt currently seems to run about on par with the Switch version. I mean this in the sense that every time you open a chest, you're greeted with the glorious gift of framedrops from 30 to probably 14 or something at the moment, all while textures look as though they were personally slathered onto every non-Player surface by your favorite non-descript post-modern ""artist"" who thought that pouring liquefied cardboard on their easel might make the ""feel"" of the texture have a bit more ""pop"".

As for the game itself, I honestly couldn't be happier! I mean, I'd like to have the latest balance patches, but I'd also like to go about my days without feeling the crushing weight of my misguided financial decisions tearing into my abdomen every time I ingest yet another Red Baron Deep Dish Single whilst watching others enjoy their lives on a small screen in the comfort of my poorly made bed, and god knows that's not changing for the next thirty years! I have a feeling we'll get the patches we need before that at least, so that's good. But seriously, it's a new and interesting system that tries its best to reward more methodical play and awareness of your defensive options while doing away with the stress factor of forcing yourself to build meter however you can, for better or for worse.

Oh also, Goro's stage has parts of its geometry literally flash in and out of existence, exposing white void behind it. Epilepsy warning, legitimately. I don't have it myself, but it sure caught me off guard when I saw Goro's dead body apparate around a void of nothingness where his throne used to be. Felt symbolic for the half-second I saw it. 

In other news, Optimization! Let's talk about it. I hate it. I'm kidding, it's almost okay. Autoconfig does its job to a degree in my experience, but the strangest thing is that I've had a worse experience with the game as I turn settings down from autoconfig. Lowering Shadows and Lighting in particular seem to introduce some sort of stutter when special attacks are used for the first time in a match, and I'm honestly baffled as to how this happens. Like, QLOC, if you see this and figure out what's going on here, I'm legitimately interested in hearing what's causing it. Nothing seems to fix the constant stutter of special moves except for just running autoconfig again, even manually returning to the original suggested settings doesn't help.

But yeah, this might not be MKX First Release levels of bad, but it's a grave omen of things to come if this is the first foot forward we see of the game. MKX was fixed down the line... Way down the line. Now that QLOC is here from the beginning, here's hoping that we'll see them spring into action and impress us sooner rather than later. I sincerely feel that the majority of the blame for the quality of both the Switch port and PC port falls squarely upon WB's shoulders. They likely rushed the ports for the sake of midnight launch, then shit fell through anyway, and now it's the devs with pie on their face. 

TL;DR: QLOC tried, they really did, but there's still plenty worth raising our voices about, most likely due to WB's managerial incompetence. Wait for patches, refund, do whatever. I didn't even mention the crashes in customization menus, for god sakes. Don't even get me started on how lame Skarlet looks, this doesn't even pertain to the quality of the game, it's just that Skarlet's default outfit needs to stop doing the whole existing thing. Give us her story outfit as default, NRS! Be cool! Oh god, the rambling is spreading. It's in my TL;DR now. Run while you still can, call my kids and tell them I mained Shao Kahn in the little time I had left on this Earthrealm! And whatever you do, make sure to tell Mr. Boon not to put the fursuit on. He'll know what it means.

(Sidenote: I had the misfortune of playing the Switch version very briefly before I reached out to Nintendo to request a refund. Bad move having High Quality screenshots on the E-Shop, WB. Baaaad move. Especially with no proper gameplay video until days before release, and even that was touched up. You'll probably be hearing a lot about false advertisement in the future. Also, props to Nintendo for actually refunding it!)",1556168044,1556168044,False,5,1,0.543883919715881348,0,True,False,False,76561198029080170,282,5,6332,0,654,1584974312,,
76,50311145,english,"I'm having an excellent time with the game. It's a very newbie friendly fighter, which is great since I haven't played fighting games for over a decade, but I keep discovering more depth to the fighting, it's not at all shallow.

The story is not interesting whatsoever, and I skipped all the kut scenes because you get some cool unlocks from beating it. But whatever, it's a fighting game, I'm not expecting The Brothers Karamazov. It took me maybe 4 hours to play through, it would have been less but NR made some kutscenes unskippable and every other skippable one you have to wait 20-30 seconds for it to let you skip. It introduced me to a lot of karacters I may not have tried but now find very fun. It's a shame there's no ""evil"" kampaign, as about half the karacters you never play in the story. It predictably focuses on Liu Kang, Raiden, and Scorpion/Sub-Zero, and you get more unlocks for them than anyone else. 

The actual fighting is great, no huge frame perfect button inputs for kombos, just hitting a few buttons in sequence, and all the moves are 4 inputs or lower, making them easier to memorize and recall. Each fighter can be kustomized in abilities, so even in a mirror match the fighters might play totally differently. The fighter diversity is typical, slow dudes with long reach, weaker dudes with powerful ranged, and plenty of in between. 

The roster is small and playing through the story you can already tell who some DLC characters will be. They are obviously totally finished and not included in the base game and withheld for DLC. I do not like this, but it is a kommon practice nowhere near exclusive to this game, and I do not hold it against them. A small roster also makes getting used to the characters easier.

The big kontroversies about this game are totally blown up by people who do not actually play the game and expect everything to be unlocked day 1. The MTs are small, and only if you want to speed up the process. There is no need for any ""easy fatality"" tokens or anything, as they are already insanely easy to pull off without them. But again, they're there if you want them and have zero impact on the game.

The Krypt is totally fine. I played for roughly 6 hours seriously grinding koins through story and towers, and wound up with 250,000 at the end, which allowed me to open a lot of chests and get a decent variety of skins,finishers, and kosmetics. I only want to say fuck the concept art, I appreciate the work the artists did, but opening a chest to get a piece of art sucks. With the devs stating there are 600 chests, each with hand picked kontents(only the positions of the chests are random, the contents of each was done by a person and not randmized), it will take awhile to unlock them all, but it also should. 

The Tower of Time is a broken mess at the moment, and the devs have acknowledged this. It is far too difficult and punishing. A fix is coming soon.

The rewards are also getting rebalanced, as it is right now online provides next to no rewards, when a single fight in the tower provides you with a krap ton of XP and koins, and are easier than an online match.

I would highly recommend this game. I have had a blast playing so far.",1556167506,1556167541,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197967477445,296,14,746,0,556,1556837132,,

I thoroughly enjoyed the story mode. Was properly reminiscent of the trash 90s action movies.

Performance is great on my mid-tier rig and played through the entire story without a hitch.

Crypt has chests that you buy for in-game money and there is no way to expedite it for real currency. As per developer Combat Kast https://www.twitch.tv/videos/415846301 contents of the chests are not random and only the locations of the chests are. 
I still do not like this system because you have to spend your gold to open it and no ability to peek inside to see if you want to skip the particular chest or not.

13,50309894,english,"At its current state. I cannot in good faith recommend this game. There are so many glaring issues with the game. The tower system as whole seems like they took a major jump backwards from the style that they had in Injustice 2 in order to ""earning"" our keep in the tower through the crypt. The fact that tower abilities are consumables instead of being mapped to armor pieces, or even having the opportunity to find gear pieces outrages me. The amount of effort needed to do a basic tower is outrageous. The frequency and potency of enemy assist just makes the entire experience obnoxious. Towers in Injustice 2 were fun at times. Some were difficult, but at least doable. Over 5 hours spent inside the tower mode and I have yet to be able to fully complete a tower. I'm not saying that I'm good or even decent, but do they really want it so that casuals are unable to go into the tower and enjoy themselves? Given that some (very few) items come exclusively from the towers, I would think that NetherRealm would actually want their players to be able to earn their content. If they were so dead set on this gear system, why did they not keep the system that they had from Injustice? I see no reason to actively push players towards this content when you are unable to buy cosmetics from the crypt as microtransactions (as far as I know). This style would have been completely fine if it wasn't for the fact that the ""cosmetics"" have specific slots for gems. Now I can't even say how effective that these gems will be because in the 9.4 hours that I've played the game, I have received one for my time, for a character that I don't play. Who knows? Maybe gems are the answer to the Tower situation, but their drop rates from the chests seem non-existent. This game almost feels like an indie studio developed it. There are mistakes that they continuously make, that most large scale companies should be able to pick up on over the several releases. Overall, I was super excited for this game.

     Also, this game is one of the greediest and scummiest games I've seen in awhile.  Having microtransactions in a 60$ game is bad enough, but the MTs in this game are so heavily pushed and so necessary if you actually want to get stuff in the Krypt.  Especially with a currency like the hearts, which you only get in quantities of ONE, and you get them primarily from doing fatalities or brutalities.  That means you can only get 1 heart per match if you WIN.  The cheapest chests you can open with red hearts cost 100, that means it takes 100 games to afford just one chest, if you win them all.  All that work for one single chest that might have items you don't even want.  (You can get hearts from other chests in the Krypt, but randomly, and in quantities of like 50.  You still have to spend other currencies to open those chests though.) 

     Also, why the f--- is Frost available as DLC???  You unlock her in campaign after only like an hour of playing.  This is so obviously a trap for customers who are unaware that Frost is unlocked in game, almost instantly.  The DLC page for it doesn't even mention she can be acquired in game.

Absolutely. 

At a base level, the fighting in this game is refined, visceral, and intense. Overall it's very enjoyable. I've already logged 15 hours into the online in this game in 2 days and I plan on logging 100's in the future. 


Where this game falls apart is it's single player ""progression"" - the Towers of Time are very obviously designed to frustrate instead of captivate. It is incredibly frustrating to fight a difficult AI, as well as dodge the millions of un-blockable off-screen projectiles coming at you. All while the menu text is advertising ""skip fight"" tokens. 

The Towers of Time are probably the best(?) way to unlock specific skins that you want for your character, because the Krypt's treasures are randomly generated. 

Not only randomly generated, but seemingly giving you loot for characters you haven't even touched. With 15 hours in the game and over 300,000 koins spent in the Krypt, I have yet to unlock a single cosmetic or brutality for Cassie Cage (my main) - but I am totally decked out for my least favorite characters like Jade and Kano (sorry Kano and Jade mains) 

You'd think with how many cosmetics they have for each character (I think 90 gear pieces for each character, and probably 20+ skins for each) - that they would be handing out the 2,250 gear cosmetics much more generously. But instead for each level (probably an hour of gameplay) - I'm receiving 10 ""Time Krystals"" instead of any meaningful progression towards my favorite characters! 

Now let's do the math: 

I have 15 hours in the game (currently) and have made and spent (past the initial gift of Koins) - approximately 50,000 koins playing online and and a few towers (this is not grinding the towers, just regular play online occasionally messing with some towers). 

That's approx. 3,333 koins per each hour of normal playing. 

Each gear box in the Krypt costs 10,000 or more koins. 

So for EVEN A SHOT at a cosmetic for your character (among literally thousands of gear pieces), you need to play for at LEAST 3 hours and some change. 

Now let's say you get a piece of gear every time you open an expensive box, that puts a slight dent in the 2,250 cosmetics. 

So for 1 piece of gear, you need to play at least 3 hours, so to unlock ALL of the gear in the game (remember this isn't even including the skins) - you need to play: 

Six-thousand
Seven Hundred
and Fifty 

hours. 


That's right, you need to play AT LEAST 6,750 HOURS TO UNLOCK ALL THE GEAR. 


Let's put that into perspective:

There are approx. 8760 hours in a year, 

If you sleep at least 8 hours a day, and go to work or school for 7-8 hours, you're left with around 2,920 hours in your year. 

Now assuming you're also a human, let's say you spend 3 hours a day eating, pooping, taking care of hygiene, talking with friends and family, etc. you're then left with 1,825 hours in your year left. 

So EVEN IF you spent every waking hour after work and natural human responsibilities/necessities to play Mortal Kombat 11, you would NEED TO SPEND 3.6 years to unlock every cosmetic. 


3.6 YEARS. 

Let me say it again. 

Three-point-Six YEARS of playing Mortal Kombat 11 NON-STOP after work/school, sleeping, and eating/hygiene/talking with friends, to unlock all cosmetics.

And that's just for the GEAR, not the skins, player cards, brutalities, fatalities, intros, and outros that also need to be unlocked. 


This is truly unacceptable and probably the worst progression I've ever seen in a video-game, this makes EA look like saints compared to NRS and WB. 

I don't even know how much real money it would cost to buy each and every cosmetic from the store either, probably in the thousands of dollars. 

It's a shame because, underneath all of the bullshit, predatory attempts to measle a few dollars from your wallet - there is an enjoyable game with great mechanics, an interesting story, some really badass fatal blow cinematics, and the gnarliest and most creative fatalities yet. 

All to be squandered by a predatory monetization system that de-voids all meaning of mastering the game (except for tournament play, but 99% of the player base doesn't play in tournaments), because even if you're the best player in the world, you're still going to get your ass kicked in the impossible and frustrating TOT and you are never going to unlock every cosmetic. 

There is no end-goal for Mortal Kombat 11, unless your end goal is spending your hard-earned money on predatory microtransactions. 


FINAL RATING: 
5/10 

TL:DR 

An otherwise solid game ruined by the years of grinding required to unlock every cosmetic.


EDIT: According to a Tweet from Angry Joe, it would cost approx. $6,440 dollars to unlock all the skins in Mortal Kombat 11.",1556152793,1556153784,False,2,1,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False,76561198067492879,153,37,2570,0,914,1595986981,,
32,50309256,english,"Ok where to start........

First I want to say that the game is designed well and the developers built an amazing combat system and the game SHOULD be a 9/10. This game is currently a 2/10. You can thank warner bros for turning what could have been a masterpiece into a piece of crap ""player engagement"" and ""recurrent user spending"" machine.

For $60-$100 you are getting a Mortal Kombat mobile game. It takes 3000 hours or $6400 to unlock everything. This is because.

1.The crypt is overpriced at the moment and is padded with items that should have been in the game already. These items include Fatalities, brutalities, character intros, character outros, taunts. That's right, the fatalities are microtransactions. They also decided to pad the crypt with icons or different colors that are useless, along with items that are to be used in the towers of time mode. All of these taken away from the game we paid $60 and moved into the crypts to either frustrate you into buying it in the in game store.

2.The developers lied about loot boxes. The regular chests in the crypt are randomized. They can either have something nice or any number of the worthless icons or consumables. This sounds like a loot box.

4. Each character has 60 costumes which seems like something good, Except most of these costumes are recolors of the same 3-4 costumes. Instead of adding a slider or the ability to customize your color like a normal game it was decided that each possible color combo would be sold separately to further pad the crypt and make it harder to get items you actually want. They are taking away things that could have been options in favor of selling it to you for $5 a skin. In a game you paid $60 for.

5.The towers of time mode is impossible in some cases. From homing missiles and nets fired at your character to being set on fire when near enemies. This mode was made purposely insanely difficult to encourage you to use those items found in the crypts mentioned earlier. They even have an item that lets you skip a match entirely. Instead of fair and balanced game play they opted to frustrate you into using items that shouldn't have been included in the game to begin with. The developers are making a problem and offering to sell you a solution.

6.Overly complicated equipment system designed to increase the grind even further. Upon finding equipment you have to level it up, Reroll for appropriate item slots, and then pay coins if at any point you decide to swap out the augments. repeat for each piece of equipment you want to use. Again options have actually been needlessly taken away from the player in order to increase the grind.

You may have noticed my 3rd reason this game is awful is missing. Pay $10 and I'll tell you what it is, $20 if you want it in a different font.

TLDR: The developers have made the game worse in almost every way in order to milk more money out of their loyal fan base. That will be $5 for the TLDR btw.

Mortal Kombat feels great to play. The fighting is smooth and neutral heavy with a great variety to all the characters. I would recommend this game for people who want a neutral, positioning focused and short combos fighting game to play against other people. But I wouldn't recommend this version.

This version is very unstable. In my time I've had it crash multiple times, both to desktop and just lock up my PC. The graphics options are good but weird. Resolution is tied to the desktop rather than what my monitor can do even with the fullscreen option, which is unlike any other game I've played since getting the monitor. AA is broken on my 980 ti with the FXAA + TAA setting causing blurring during game play and this smudging effect for transitions between cinematics and gameplay. 

Another reason I can't recommend the game is that beyond the story mode and tutorial the single player content is garbage. The Towers of Time mode which is required to be played if you want to get all the cosmetics is unbalanced and requires a long grind to even properly engage with. The towers are also random on two hour rotations so good luck finding that skin you want for your favorite character. Each tower is meant to be beaten using a consumable that is randomly acquired from other places in the game, either the over priced krypt or regular towers that only give currency and consumables. These cosmetics can also be bought randomly from the store for a premium currency that can be earned but only in a limited quantity. Also, the items cost around $5 each. At least this is all cosmetic, though brutalities being behind this grind and paywall is annoying. 

In short get the PS4 version if you really love this kind of fighting game and want to play online against other people. Everyone else just watch the story mode and give this game a pass.",1556152901,1556152901,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197968184151,802,3,1362,0,862,1556860700,,

62,50307990,english,"Please do not be too alarmed by all the negative reviews on the page. Here's a few of my own thoughts, having done the story mode.

The game is amazing gameplay wise. I'm not much of a fighting game player, having only played a bit of MK9 and MKX, but even I can tell that MK11 plays really well, and fairly accessible to new players, especially with some characters like Noob Saibot. WIth the ability to customize your fighters, you can pick and choose abilities you find to be the easiest and effective to use. 

The story was very fun, its like playing an interactive hollywood blockbuster. The plot is at times a bit silly, but the characters and the cinematic fight sequences make it an overall very enjoyable few hours. (Ronda Rousey as Sonya is a bit shakey though, but no big deal).

Now, onto the controversy. 

Firstly, the microtransactions. Yes, it is a bit excessive, and a bit daunting when you first step into the the krypt to see all the stuff you need to unlock and all the currencies you have to gather. But know this, this will be the only Netherrealms game we will be getting in a fairly long while. NRS even said that they will have longer support for this game than any other title. So a part of the reason why they made it a huge grind was the hopes of keeping the game alive for longer. Obviously I don't think this is a particularly smart way to go about it, but I feel like knowing a part of their motivation helps me to understand their choices. I do hope they fix it, perhaps not by shortening the grind, but giving us more things to collect. Please remember that EVERYTHING unlockable is purely cosmetic, every ability of every character is available from day one. 

Secondly, the female characters. It's very sad that they have made the characters a lot less skimpy/sexy, while the males received no real changes. I do not want to go into the politics too much, but it is definitely a shame when you consider the reason why NRS have to pretty much censor their female characters. It is definitely not a design choice. Comparing to MK9, which I do consider to be a little excessive on the skimpiness, to a point of being a little repetitive and silly, MKX and MK11 simply did not have such luxuries. I do believe that for some of the characters like Jade, sexiness is a big part of what they are. NRS should not give in to the PC police, and instead give us the best, most on point versions of each, whether it means showing more skin, having bigger bits, or anywhere in between. But despite the censorship, NRS did a fantastic job on most of the characters, especially the facial expressions. 

So far, I have had no issues with MK11's PC port, online seems to work fine at the moment. With the long term support we will be getting, I'm sure NRS will amend some of the issues outlined in this review. Right now, I think MK11, while a little on the expensive side, is a decent buy, especially if you are a fan of the franchise, or have played the previous entries. The story mode alone is a worthwhile investment, and everything else hopefully NRS will deal with in response to player complaints and suggestions.

- Delayed start (Console owners got it on midnight)
- Microtransactions? Really? In MK?? Do a fatality on every single one of them. And for a game that costs 60‚Ç¨.
- Ignorance towards PC Version - many problems with graphic, crashes etc. 
- Your Kombat Kasts are a joke, i advise you to be more friendly towards your customers
- MK11 launch event was the most absurd and cringiest thing i ever saw

74,50307210,english,"I don't write reviews, most I've seen articulate my feeling well enough. But I believe this needs to be said as I have seen barely anyone mention it; 90%-95% of the game requires an online connection to fully use. The online multiplayer fights & towers of time understandably require a internet connection to use. However I can't fathom why the gear/variation system, coins/currency, rewards, The Klassic Towers & The Krypt (also: why is the Krypt randomised) needs a connection to a server to use. It wouldn't be an issue if I could even connect to the MK11 servers in the first place. The Micro-transaction aspect is very predatory & is a worse version of the ""source-crystals"" from Injustice 2. 

A few more issues I've had is; crashing on the customisation menu, I set my game to the lowest quality to start with to see how it preforms (which is quite well) but it still crashed on multiple occasions. I can't speak about the ""grind"" (which I was willing to overlook going into the game) as I never was able to experience it (due to the server issue). The menus for me are a bit more awkward to navigate (compares to previous NRS games) 

A few positives which give me a bit of hope in the future is the core game is well polished & the base roster is one of the best. The in-game animation has improved quite a bit over MKX. The sound design (music & effects) are really well done. The visuals have improved (graphically & in general art direction). The tutorials have taken a page from Injustice 2 and have been substantially improved from MKX (which even includes individual charcter tutorials) The character design is amazing (especially the new-comers); & the story mode (despite plot flaws) was fun (to watch/play the first 4 chapters of) & really well presented)

I may retract & re-review the game should there be sufficient changes to the issues previously addressed (especially the horrible reliance on a stable internet connection to even access the majority of the game). Thanks for reading & hope you have a pleasant day.

91,50307260,english,"Weird to say that I don't recommend this game since the fights are fun, the graphics are amazing and the story is very enjoyable. But the cons are what makes us not want to play the game after the story is done:
-Too much grinding to get skins and items, this is VERY boring for a fighting game, also because the modifiers made the towers so hard that you get stuck for too long to beat some enemies. And you don't get stuck because you lack the technique to play, but because they add a handicap and other benefits the AI.
-They showed lack of respect with the fans that have been sustaining the brand through almost 30 years by saying that ""they won't add the classic skins for the female characters"" supposedly because they were showing too much skin, while the male characters are shirtless and have way more design freedom. And to be honest, if you think about Kitana's classic outfit from Mortal Kombat 2, I don't really see any problem with the design, she wasn't using anything absurd like a bikini plate mail armour or other designs worth of a JRPG back there.
-And about designs, they went too far with the Injustice art-style. Almost every character wears a tasset and has random metal pieces stuck to their bodies. That and also the fact that every female character either looks like they came from a space opera universe, are a power ranger villain or simply wear the same clothes with different colours (that feels funny when we talk about a Mortal Kombat game but come on, it's 2019.. MK X had the best designs in my opinion)
-The game feels totally different to play than the previous ones, that makes hard for us to adapt and they removed the jumping punch that made the enemy kick on the ground, something that was a starter for many and many combos. This lack of continuation on the mechanics causes the feeling that this is a different fighting game that happens to have Mortal Kombat characters.
-People are talking about the servers, but I think that this will be solved soon with the next patches, so I won't complain about it for now.

I could change my mind and make more effort to adapt to the new mechanics if they did 2 things:
-Reduced the grinding

I wasn't planning on making a review this early on since i haven't been able to play that much since i bought it yeasterday.
But i were able to take atleast 12 matches and a few online matches with no problem at all so lets begin.

I have read alot of reviews about bad performance and the frame drops, so let's start from my perspective with the little game time i've had.

30 FPS lock? This was as far as i have read something NRS have done intentionally to ""show"" of more gore in the fatalities, that they have locked the menu and krypt aswell is just dumb and hopefully this will be fixed.

Bad performance? Lets start off saying that i have an old PC and im playing this on the highest quality possible since i like the graphics in this game. I am absolutely not getting ANY kind of FPS drop or stutter during the fights so a shout out to people who get this error make sure that you are acually meeting the requirments and have updated your graphics driver.

Microtransactions? is not something i care much about, but for a game that cost ‚Ç¨60 and with a kombat pack to ‚Ç¨30 this is just dumb aswell and should be changed aswell.

Grinding? This is something i'm looking forward to, since im playing alot of grinding games this is of course my opinion(personal opinion *GASP* in 2019)

Crashes? This is not something i have experienced aswell, everything works better than expected.

This is not a hateful comment to everyone who diskliked the game as you are free to have your opinion aswell!

I will go ahead and give this game a positive review because:
- the netsplit is awesome, most times you don't feel the lag AT ALL.
- the gameplay is amazing, definitely the klassic MK experience minus the time towers (which are getting fixed next update)
- well optimized
- even though the Krypt is random, they announced that the shao kahn chests are in same locations for everyone
- most of the outfits are great
- story mode is awesome
- a great soundtrack that is very fitting to 00's MK era
- the fatalities are brutal as always 
- most importantly, shao kahn taunts you and tells that you suck straight up to your face!

cons:

- time towers are PAINFUL but as of today's kombatkast, they confirmed that the modifiers will have a longer cooldown and also will be BLOCKABLE

14,50306116,english,"Let's talk about the positives before the negatives. 

1) The story mode is, as always, excellent. I think it's a step up from Mortal Kombat Xs for sure and maybe even Mortal Kombat IXs. 
2) Single Player Kombat Towers is a classic. Great. 
3) Actual Kombat feels great also.
4) All the essential stuff is not locked in the Lootboxes.

Now, it may seem weird to complain and say that I don't recommend the game because essentially the most important aspects are positive right? Here's where things get... bad in my opinion.

1) Random Crash to Desktop. I didn't get it at all during Story Mode. I didn't get it at all when doing some random towers. I did however get a couple today, despite playing less than I did yesterday. 

2) Lootbox Simulator. This is the big issue for me. If I want to grind and play a grinding game, I'd play either a Korean MMO or play Warframe. I love Warframe, but this game is the biggest grind I've ever seen when it comes to grinds and was CLEARLY made to try and strap people of their cash.

""But, it's Cosmetics only right?"" Well, not quite. You can get 'Augments' that make you stronger or 'Consumables' in the single player modes. Coins, Souls and Hearts are infrequent. Sure, you can get a steady 'stream' of them, but for example: You need 250 Hearts to unlock a chest. To get one/two hearts, you need to preform a Fatality/Brutality. (Brutalities are slightly harder to pull off.) ONE HEART for a Fatality. That's 250 Matches at least.

And yet this is nothing compared to my third big complaint:

3) Towers of Time

The best way to farm the currency for the skins and all that in the game are the Towers of Time. They're time limited and some fights have special handicaps that help the opponent entirely. If you remember ""Test your Luck"" from the previous games, you know where this is going except you will gain no positive effects and your opponent will have no negative effects.

To top it off, the boss of the Tower of Times usually have double health also. I literally spent many many a time trying to beat some of these: One of them was a Boss fight with Fire coming from underneath you and Water to force you to slip. You can't even stand still or do a two hit combo (let alone more) without you losing a quarter of your health because the fire decided to spawn underneath you and then you slip, taking more damage. At least that felt kind of fair still, despite the fact that the fire is probably the main reason you will die in this challenge and was basically luck based.

I basically gave up with a challenge at one point with one that involves Hsu Hao's Laser. Another boss fight, but this laser does insane damage, stays long enough to hit you if you jump, can't be crouched and can't be blocked and is next to impossible to react too. It shoots from one side of the room to the other also. It also does about 1/10th of your health if it hits you also, can come at you at anytime.

Now, I know what I am SUPPOSED to do is farm up and find consumables either from the random rewards that the Tower of Time can give or randomly from the Krypt. I know that I'm supposed to have some consumables, one of them being a item that probably makes me take half damage from Energy based attacks. However it's completely random if I get those from the Krypt or from other Tower of Times. 

I should mention that there's one similiar to Hsu Hao's Laser which is almost identical except that instead of a ton of damage it simply puts you in a dizzying state? It's a little slower and a little more reactable but still insane that I can't do more than a two hit combo without this thing appearing and then hitting me. 

Did I mention for the Character Towers of Time, you got to spend coins to UNLOCK these towers also? 25K for first level. 

It's this plus the Krypt that really put me off continuing to want to unlock skins and cosmetics in this game, something I normally like doing. I like doing Challenge Towers and such like in previous games. This though is a slog. When you make grinding in a Fighting Game seem unbearable and making me think I might as well spend time in Warframe as that game requires LESS grinding, then you probably need to rethink how much resources and how much the chests in this game costs. Warframe is literally a game about Grinding. 

Please, fix this. I want to like this game. I do enjoy the game. The Tower of Time challenges can be fun, but they shouldn't be mandatory for grinding.

What I would fix: 

First: The Crash to Desktop issue is super important to fix. Most important thing to fix, but may also be the most difficult to pinpoint.

Second: Reduce the Cost of items in Crypt AND increase the rate we get resources to unlock stuff in the Krypt. Doing one or the other I don't think would be enough, I think both need to be done. Even 5 Hearts per Fatality, for example, is still quite an insane grind.

Third: Reduce SOME of the challenges of the Towers of Time. Some of them are pretty fair, but others, such as the Hsu Hao Laser I mentioned, are incredibly insane. If need be, make the challenges optional, but reduce some of the rewards you'd get if you ignore the challenge entirely (sort of like how we have AI Fighters that can let us do some of the fights for us.)

The story mode is some of the best I've seen in the fighting game genre. the gameplay mechanics are slower than MKX but more calculating and punishing. the character rosters adds new characters (Im a big fan of Kollector) and adds returning characters from Previous games. The customization while grindy is well worth the skins that you can find and the customization that you can do for the characters you enjoy. 

The Only Issues I have with the game are 
1) The Antialiasing in game is not good but with Nvidia GPU's this can be fixed easily 
2) The Krypt runs at 30 fps. This I dont understand at all.

Now to address the elephant in the room... the microtransactions and the contreversy around one of the character endings
- In my time playing the game I have found no reason to spend money on microtransactions. while the towers of time are incredibly chalenging It reminds me of the Test Your Luck Mode from previous games which I always enjoyed
- The Jax ending is SPOILERS that he goes back intime to prevent slavery and by doing so he creates a wakanda like nation. I really dont understand how this is controversial and if anything I belive that those who disagree with this ending are just racists

While the Progression should be changed going forward (it sounds like they will be doing so going forward) this is still in my opinion the best fighting game that you can get your hands on and play.

I will start with cons, 'cause they're really bad.
Cons: 
- Almost forced online connection. I haven't heard any mentions of it at pre-release time. 
- Microtransactions. Yep, you may unlock anything via grind, but VERY slowly. And the game advertises its ""pay to buy crystals"" everywhere, even on loading screens. (Really, I don't mind grind for some ingame goodies, but not when the grind is taken up to eleven 'cause of ""pay to not grind"" practice.  if I'd want to grind, I'd rather play Diablo 3 or Grim Dawn, they don't even offer me microtransactions and therefore are more balanced in terms of time required for obtaining an each new goody). 
- Strange graphical glitches (the most noticeable is strange flickering hair) and visual soap. 
Pros: 
+ Noob Saibot
+ Good customization (flawed by MTCs, but still)
+ Very tactical gameplay. 
+ Glitches aside, the graphics are quite cool. 
+ I played for 0.8 hours. I'd play more, because the gameplay itself is addictive, but the game crashed before I played for 2 hours, so my opportunity for refund is saved. Thank you, the good crash!

I'm thinking of refund for now: 'cause I'm not into online play and love to just fight bots, the almost forced online connection (the game is playable offline, but you should be connected even for single player for your customizations to be in place) disappoints me. I'll wait for some time and see if anything will change via patches. This review is to be updated.

+ Huge stack of content across all unlockables, campaign, towers
+ I suck at PvP so big single player set of unlockables is big win for me.  Yes you can pay to skip grind - but why do that?  You're skipping out on half the fun of progression.  Personally I hated when Street Fighter had all characters unlocked - anyway maybe thats personal preference. Also these unlocks do not affect winning at all and they are no way forced on you
+ Super high production on story mode
+ Great net code straight at release
+ Fights looks amazing esp environments
+ Slower paced but more tactical
+ Crushing blows at a great layer to keep you watching opponent
+ Old characters return and completely reworked.  No more ninja re-colours.  Everyone is distinct.

I purchased this game more than two months ago and waited the date of its release with much enthusiasm. Yesterday the game was finally activated on Steam, yet I could not even get it to start yet. When I try to launch it, an icon/image of the game appears on my screen, then the screen turns dark for a second. Immediately afterwards the game crashes to desktop and does not launch at all. I have read the comments and reviews of hundreds of customers in Steam community forums and noticed that many others experience the same problem... I have tried many different methods suggested by others to resolve the issue. Uninstalled and downloaded the game again, turned off all my anti-virus softwares, de-activated my keyboard and mouse so that the game only identifies the gamepad (just in case the game has an incompatibility issue with various keyboards as suggested by several customers). Yet none of these methods have worked so far... By the way, please note that my PC is a high-end gaming PC and it more than meets the minimum requirements. I am extremely frustrated with the developer of the game and do not wish to continue to support their faulty product and encourage such incompetence. I would prefer to spend my money on other Steam games in the near future. As such, could you please provide a refund as soon as possible. Look forward to hearing from you and wish all the best.

2. Interesting customizing aspects

Cons:
1. Towers of Time are pretty much broken and a grind to play
2. The Krypt is basically locked unless you grind the towers to make koins
3. Almost all custom material is locked in the Krypt or the Towers of Time

So basically, the cons are everything that WB/Netherrealm studios said they would work on. Granted, it's not like I place my full trust in WB or anything, but the developers are recognizing that (in its current state) the Krypt and Towers of Time are fundamentally broken.  And that's definitely irritating, especially when purchasing a game like this at the price they sell it at.

But, on the other hand, the story delivers. The returning characters+new character roster delivers. You have a really complex villain where, at times, you're unsure whether you agree with her or disagree. Some of the old characters who never got much of a platform in past games got their chance to shine in this one, and at the end of the day, I really believe that the writers hit the nail right on the head.

My problems are with the game itself which screams ""bad/rushed PC port"". Here's a list for ya:

1. The constant switching between 30 and 60 fps locks MID-FIGHT, I repeat, IN THE MIDDLE OF GAMEPLAY, is so horrendously jarring and frustrating it ruins the experience. We live in 2019. Indie developers managed to figure their way around FPS locks 20 years ago. This is just no longer acceptable. I'm not sure if it's apathy or incompetence, but this sh*t needs to change. And a 30 fps lock in the Krypt? Really?

2. Always online singleplayer. It would be bad enough if a momentary internet problem interrupted the game for a bit. But it straight up CLOSES THE GAME AND ASKS YOU TO RESTART!? I gotta say, this joke, or whatever it is, is in pretty poor taste. But yeah, not even a reconnect or anything. I was playing STORY MODE and I had to RESTART THE GAME 3 TIMES because of connection issues with the server. It just instantly stops in the middle of a cutscene and goes ""Whoops, sorry, connection issue, please restart the game"". What the actual f*ck!?

3. Tons of basic features are bugged or missing. Why do moves and combos that you stick onto the screen reset after each fight, even if it's the same characters!? There's no save feature for them of any kind? Another thing is that you can't access options in the middle of a match. Also, why do I have to go through another full loading screen just to RETRY a fight!?

4. Some inputs are straight up wrong (though, not many), showing you the wrong inputs required for a move or combo.

5. Graphical issues with lighting and hair, not sure if it's just bugs or a straight up downgrade.

6. The fun challenge modes are gone and the singleplayer story was honestly kind of underwhelming, especially the incredibly short and vague ending.

Mortal Kombat 11 is not a terrible game. But it is not a $60 game. It feels like nobody cared about the PC experience, like they just ticked a box to make sure the game launches on PC at all and called it a day. As it stands, my experience with the game was worth maybe $15. After my 3rd disconnect in !singleplayer! I was so so so incredibly close to getting a refund, I was 1 click away.

Overall, MK11 is a solid game for what it is, a fighter. You have a great story mode (by fighting game standards), decent online mode, and bombastic flow of combat. However, it's pretty clear that as soon as NRS launched MK9, bringing back the franchise from the dead, NRS is slowly killing it again with MK11. It feels less like a Mortal Kombat, and more of a super hero fighter. In fact, I'd say this game feels farther away from that klassic MK feel, than any other in the series.

I cannot in good faith recommend this to anyone, because it doesnt serve anyone any good. It spits in the face of the fans, and does little to pull in others. That, along with multiple sleezy microtransactions, and a clear political agenda to boot. While MK9 sported the copy/paste pornstar bodies of all the female characters, this does the opposite with the same tame, frumpy, small chested bodies for every one of them. Even if the characters weren't covered from head to toe, I'd see sexier bodies in female mma.

All the additions and little tweaks to Gameplay are meaning full and deepen the experience: like no more sprinting; having the meter bar from MKX split up in offense, defense and Fatal Blow; Xrays are living on as ""Crushing Blows"" and many more details.

Regular kombat is great. I enjoy matches on increasing difficulty and ect. Love the normal towers.

I absolutely HATE the Towers of Time. They're essential to unlock gear and items, only problem is, you really need said gear and items to actually play this mode. The grind is horrendous. After consuming almost my entire time playing it, I can say I actively despise how its structured. Most of the modes in it are garbage. Having the AI being able to call in one character repeatedly for the whole round is just a fucking mess. No, it's not more challenging, it's just a terrible game mode. I've played a fair bit of Dragon Ball Fighter Z on console and PC, and that is structured for call ins. Mortal Kombat is NOT.

As of right now, the extreme grind, and the shitty Towers of Time being basically essential, unfortunately means I don't recommend this game. I don't recommend spending money in this game.

Now what TRULY matters in a MK game, The GAME PLAY

This is hands down one of the best entries as far as game play is concerned. The graphics are great and the framerate is perfectly stable. The uses of Xrays as a final measure is WAY better than building it up and using it multiple times a round (seriously that was bullshit in X). The Fighting is clean and fast. The level design is great (Aside from the waves int eh ocean, those are a big oof).

The grinding is horrendous and a big middle finger to a lot of players who enjoy single player mode and character customization.

56,50298567,english,"Best mortal kombat story to date, the cinematics and scriptwriting are leaps and bounds ahead of previous MK titles. The characters all have emotion depth personality and individual drive and motivations. Its been a while since i got so invested in a video games story, especially a fighting game one. The footsie based combat is different but works well imo, though in early days will obviously favour heavy projectile gameplay until players get used to countering it and getting in. The characters movesets and variations make for varied and interesting setups which will reward players who experiment with them in training. All the character designs are fresh and look outstanding including [spoiler] Fire God Liu Kang [/spoiler] who made me so hype to play in the story. I've been an MK fan since 9 and I had an absolute blast with the story despite the server connection drops and the fucking cloud save system that kept prompting me to upload data over and over. 

For all the praises I've sung about this games story and core mechanics, the rest of the game really lets it down and is extremely disappointing. There's so much stuff to complain about so I'm just going to bullet point the stuff that let me down personally. I'm sure you can find another review if you want a comprehensive breakdown on bugs and features but this is what hurt [i] me [/i] most.

- The framerate issues all over the place shows they haven't learned from MKX, to the point where I'm getting the same issues on MK11 launch that I had on MKX's launch.

- The Krypt is a clusterfuck of collectable craftable items and crafting components that when I first saw I immediately thought of the F2P Final Fantasy mobile game, with so many different collectables that will surely push everyone from completionists to casual players to buy some V-bucks so they can catch up. The 30 fps, F2P-model-looking-ass Krypt actually made me mad, like irl mad. I loved the design and use of the Krypt in previous MK titles to add fun collectables like skins concept art and alternate fatality inputs to the single-player side but now its just a gimmick to coerce players into chucking another ¬£60+ into a game they already spent ¬£50 on just to own.

-Some maps for me make the game run at half speed? Pulling solid 60fps but playing in slow motion is weird but this also happened to me on MKX on my old computer, maybe this is a graphics card bug for me and it'll get patched/ Nvidia will update but it's still really annoying in story mode atm.

- Heart boxes cost 250 hearts. You get [i] one [/i] per fatality and [i] two [/i] per brutality. Yeah.

-The worst bit, the absolute [b] WORST [/b] bit that probably made me wake my neighbours was when first trying the crafting system it encourages you to try a combination in the forge with either no recipes or with ones you probably don't have the materials for, then if you fuck it up (and with no recipe you probably will) you lose the currency and items you tried to craft with. There's no text box explaining it, you're just told you can craft items. This is the shit you can pay [i] r e a l [/i] money for the chance of getting materials for, and they present it in such a way that you can not only just chuck materials away, and need to pay for them later but are kinda lured into doing so. By the time you've found the forge in the Krypt, you will have opened a fair few boxes and noticed that about 70% of the drops are crafting items you'll probably want to put the materials you just spent half your V-bucks on to see what they do, and end up wasting them. Now of course i'm a dumb dumb for not waiting and using the recipe in the first place but the lack of information or warning about using the forge makes me believe they want you to accidentally waste some materials to encourage you to buy more later on. But maybe it's just me?

So i do recommend this game because the story and gameplay is fantastic but after all the negative feedback people have given I hope they'll cut back on the microtransactions and F2P grind which to be fair a lot of big companies have done after major backlash. Here's hoping hey?

Game runs flawless at 1440P/60FPS on my rig. 5 hours non-stop, not a SINGLE crash. There are some hitches during restarts in training mode if you're in the middle of a fatal blow due to the 30>60FPS shifts (haven't encountered this on PS4?) but other then that, the game has run superbly for me.

Do yourself a favor and TURN OFF any AA method besides FXAA. The game looks like a blured mess with anything else enabled, ESP. with motion blur turned on.  I would highly advocate for the best overall visual clarity, kill both motion blur and keep AA at FXAA, or disabled. Crank or tune the other graphical settings to your desire.

Thats about all I have. Everyone complaining about performance issues/crashes I'm sure have valid complaints. I thankfully haven't been one of the end-users encountering any of them, thus far. Time will tell.

I'm sure it's been stated multiple times already by various people, NRS/Boon have already stated those portions of the game that are a pain-point for a lot of people are being addressed and a patch will likely drop later today for those strongly adverse to the current state of those portions of the game. Me personally, I don't care either way. But I can understand why it has a lot of people butthurt.

In closing; the overall presentation, fan-service and attention to detail in this game is NRS' simply best ever made, bar none. If you're too butthurt over microtransactions and progression nonsense to see this and enjoy everything else, I don't know what to tell you.

gameplay wise its deep and rich with great gameplay but problems related to the PC version are far too many that its forshadowing the good parts of this game. 

Frame rate is atrocious, cinematics are locked on 30 FPS but gameplay is on 60 so alot of the time mid fight when an animation pops up it will be shown on 30 fps and it quickly goes back to 60 in the fight, it is causing me and alot of people who i talked to motion sickness and screen tears,  and no VSYNC ON  is not an acceptable  option to lock it all at 30 FPS. 

game also crashes here and there on PC, and its stutters occasionally mid fight. 

CONNECTION ON ONLINE MATCHES ARE VERY BAD. 
SO FAR I DID NOT HAVE A SINGLE GAME BELOW 100ms PING Even when i try to play with friends who are VERY CLOSE distance, and it cant be my connection since i dont have more than 50-70ms MAXIMUM for other games when played in Europe.

as for the fighters roster, 25 at release with shao khan and Frost which is unlockable through story. but this roster is far too limited in my opinion and it needed at least a few more fighters to feel more satisfying.

Poor menu performance

Unstable and inconsistent FPS

Ronda Rousey

Always online, cannot access many features if your net is down or you want to play offline

This means if the janky servers go down for even a second (And they constantly do) you lose your progress and have to relaunch the game.

Slows PC CPU down across the board, making it hard to alt-tab and do other things while the game is open

Ridiculous grinds for rewards that are completely RNG (Really sucks if you only play one character..)

Stupidly difficult and cheap ""towers"" that are not fun to play, but are necessary for the previously mentioned ridiculous grind

Unoriginal and few alternate costume designs (Recolours are not a new costume, and the default costume minus some sleeves is also not a new costume)

Unnecessary politics

Where the heck is Mileena? (MK11 has a fairly baffling roster to begin with honestly)

RPG-ish loot system where you equip your characters with gear augmentations that give them bonuses and such. It will take you hours to get the right gear, for the right character, with the right stats, for the right slot, because it is almost entirely RNG and grind.

The single player towers expect you to rely on gimmicks like consumables and gear augmentation to win, rather than pure skill. What's the point of a game where you 1v1 against someone in combat, if your skill is never tested?

The combat is great, the core gameplay is great, but the bulk of the game is impossible to ease into.

- Jax's ending making reference to the racism: Was that message really necessary?

- Shao Kahn (The bad guy) with the MAGA reference: FYI I would say 80% (at least) us MK players don't hate Trump, actually I'm sure many of them support him, congratulations for offending almost the entire MK player base.

I really want this SJW madness to be over, I cannot support a company that submits to this mob sorry.

15,50296444,english,"There's grindy cheese all over it. What you get out of the box is absolutely stellar, though, so it's beyond worth a buy. And then the stuff for which you have to grind is also stellar. NRS have said they're going to make the grind more fun ""in hours rather than days,"" so I'm not very worried about its future.

Here's why this game is worth a buy, even though the extras (skins, fatality 2 and brutalities) need to be ground out like it's the only game you own.

1. Best story a fighting game has ever told. Voice acting and presentation really sell some genuinely emotional moments for the first time in fighting game history. Parts of it are actually funny, too. Really great story. And I actually enjoy watching Shao Kahn on screen, now. He is such an unbelievable tyrant a-hole. They did a great job with him.

2. Best character aesthetics I've ever seen outside of KI 2013. Seriously. Every single character looks awesome. Even Sheeva, when you see her for a few minutes in the story mode.

3. Coolest fatalities in any fighting game, ever. D'Vorah barfs on your face. Then you have a seizure on the ground. Then man-sized spider legs burst from your chest. When they touch the ground. your torso separates from your lower body as the spider's shell. Finally, your head splits in two and the spider's head bursts out of it. Holy mother of fuck, you guys.

4. The Krypt is the most nostalgic thing I've ever seen. It's like Fallout: Shang Tsung's Island. You walk around it in third person and get to see all of the stages from MK1 and how they're connected to each other. And you find...let's call them MK easter eggs...that tell you what's going on with some of the characters not in this game. This exploration/nostalgia is the bright silver lining around the grind the Krypt represents. It's seriously going to take forever to get every skin and fatality I want. That part does really suck.

5. This is the most complex fighting system MK has ever had. Offense and defense meters let you decide how you want to amp offense and defense separately, so you're inclined to take advantage of them more often than you did in MKX (where one bar served all EX moves). Wake ups are now a bar-oriented system for everyone. Zoning isn't nearly as good as it usually is (almost everyone has projectiles, but most characters don't want to be using them). Damage numbers are small, but combo still gives technical players an edge. This means opening up opponents is more important than ever. It takes 4-6 combos to kill someone, not 2-4. Neutral is the fun part, so this makes sure there's more of the fun part each match.

6. The tutorial is great. It even teaches you how to understand frame data. KI is no longer the only game with a tutorial worth playing.

7. The game is full of little flourishes that are completely delightful. Even the character intros make it into easter egg and meme territory, now and then. I'm smiling to myself constantly while I play this game.

Unlocking the skins, brutalities and fatalities will take forever, and that sucks. However, everything you can do in this game without grinding is breathtaking, anyway. This is the most premium-tier fighting game that's ever been made.

They can reduce the grind. They could cut all the costs of every chest and thing by 75% and increase your rewards by 500%. But see, here's the inherent problem with Mortal Kombat 11, that I don't think people will totally grasp. It doesn't matter how much they increase rewards or reduce cost.

So the fact you are forced to play a mobile game to unlock things, completely detracts from the terrific fighting component, and makes me not want to play.

I like to play games at a competitive level, and it feels like this game has a nice flow to it. And that would be great if I can fucking practice with the tournament settings as a default, or an option. How could developers of this game try to push for a competitive atmosphere when you can't even train with tournament settings as default, let alone as an option. 

For those unaware, they ditched the MKX style of 3 variations per character (much needed change imo), and gave each character a list of special moves they can add to their arsenal along side their preset special moves, up to 3 per character as long as those special moves do not conflict. However, for the integrity of the tournaments and competitive modes, they locked each character to only having two variations. This is necessary for the healthiness and balance of the competitive modes, but its even more necessary to allow us to use these fucking variations by default. This game has no option of changing your variation to the tournament mode, or locking it only to the tournament variations. What you have to do is go take a picture of the tournament variations, change them individually on your character, and now you have to do that for every character. How anyone could not see this basic oversight boggles the functioning human brain.

Somewhere underneath this jumbled fuckup of a launch is a good fighting game with lots of singleplayer content, that smoothly transitions into a more competitive multiplayer mindset and game style.

Gonna do a quickie review of this game without going into the ""political"" garbage that both sides of the argument have been on about lately. Note that I don't have much to say about the things in the ""pros"" list simply because they are that good. I don't have much to say about them other than that they are quality-assured.

Pros:
- Fantastic gameplay. Tight, responsive, easy to learn, and hard to master.
- Accessible: has one of the best fighting game tutorial/practice modes I've EVER used. Even allows for live viewing of frame data, etc.
- Great story mode, per usual with Mortal Kombat. 
- Kustom Variations: adds so much gameplay kustomization, also allows the tweaking of AI using your variations.

Neutral:
- TONS of visual kustomization (PRO), but is hindered by a weak loot box progression system (CON). While the currency used for them isn't for sale (I'm pretty sure, correct me if I'm wrong), it's still lazy and makes you rely heavily on RNG to unlock items you want.

Cons:
- Bugs: I tweaked some settings after getting a crash once and have had no problems since then, but the fact that so many people are affected by them is inexcusable. (If your game looks bad or runs poorly, turn off TAA. I set mine to FXAA and it fixed almost everything performance related.)
- Microtransactions: used to help progression in Towers of Time. The difficulty in the towers encourages their use. Even though NR stated that a patch is coming to fix the difficulty, it is still annoying.
- Online: almost every single action in this game requires connection to NR servers. I haven't experienced any outages yet, but it is an inconvenience for those who want to play offline.
- Pre-Order Shenanigans: At least with the pre-order character in MKX, he was effectively just a DLC character. Shao Khan in this game is IN the story mode as a COMPLETE kharacter, fought AGAINST in the story mode, and is still locked behind a paywall. NR also advertised on their twitter about multiple betas for pre-ordering, among other things, but neglected to mention PC was not apart of this deal. Only by checking their website would you have known.
- Post-game singleplayer progression: DESIGNED to steal money. Warner Bros is the publisher behind Shadow of War, so that should give you an idea.
- The Krypt: If the gear and materials in it weren't random loot box garbage that is not worth the koins to buy, and was more akin to MKX's in terms of unlocks, it would be fine.
- 30fps locks: The Krypt, fatalities, fatal blows, etc. are all locked at 30fps. Can be pretty jarring for some.
- Frost: she is unlockable early on in story mode, but is advertised as DLC on the store page with no mention that she's UNLOCKABLE like an HOUR into the game, WITHOUT having to spend $6.

I really want to recommend this game, because I don't think it deserves like a 4/10 simply because its gameplay is so damn good. However, until NR can learn to respect its PC players with a functional port and have a publisher less scummy, wait for this game to go on sale.",1556076343,1556077134,False,1,0,0.505617976188659668,0,True,False,False,76561198067441203,777,25,12308,0,470,1584479891,,

I cannot believe the game was released with the intention to instantly initiate damage control and the public is praising them. This company has been around for the same amount of time I have been on this earth, I grew up with the franchise and they knew better. I bought the $100.00 premium edition with only one of the dlc fighters confirmed. I was then provided a game that is requiring me to spend an obscene amount of time to grind for the chance of getting a cosmetic for the only character I intended to play (Kitana). I would have even been willing to spend money to instantly get a cosmetic skin of my choosing. Instead I am asked to wait several hours for the random selection of 6 items to cycle to buy one or venture my way into the krypt to use the glorified loot boxes. This combined with the Benevolent Sexism the game is forcing on us by only covering up women and putting them in full body suits while the men are all shirtless and ripped (This opinion is coming from a gay male) is why I have refunded the game and will wait for all of these things to be fixed.

Have they ever watched female wrestling? or female's fight in mma? or females box both regular and kickboxing in real life?  Women wear much less clothing to fight and they also have made it look like the ladies are so weak they need lots of armor to fight the male fighters in this game.

They sexualized the men no shirts some legs exposed so they also made it clear that women should be ashamed of their figure and should they be proud to have any type of figure at all and wish to show a little skin then they are sluts for it. Total bullshit excu

While the gameplay is very solid and the story is amazingly fun (even though i felt the ending was a bit anti-climatic) the game has a HIDEOUS microtransaction system.

The devs already knew the reaction people would have as they waited until the very last moment for us to realize how bad the krypt and towers of time system is, esentially they made a terrible design so they would ""fix"" it and make it bad but not terrible and think the community would suck it up and that'd be the end of it. (Spoilers: It won't be.)

Everything in the krypt is completely random and the konsumables' system is AWFUL, they make the towers of time stupidly difficult, at some points without the use of konsumables the challenge can be borderline impossible.

For $100 USD I am expecting a polished game on release. That is not what I got. Firstly, the game did not release at midnight as it did on consoles; instead, PC players were expected to wait anywhere from a few to over 12 hours to play. This is unacceptable in 2019. Secondly, the game runs poorly and looks noticeably worse than any other version except the Switch. Again, unacceptable in 2019. The art style of the game is bright and cartoon-like, a departure from MK X's realistic tone (This is more of a personal gripe but still something I do not like.)

The entire game is stuffed to the brim with every trope you can think of. Microtransactions? Everywhere. Grind?  Literally everywhere. Denuvo? Oh yeah it's got that too.

The developers have said they intend to fix the balancing issues and currency (kurrency?) problems. I don't care. They are only fixing it because of the backlash, much like they kept it underwraps as long as possible because they KNEW there would be a backlash. 

I would recommend to wait until a GOTY or heavily discounted version is available. It is not worth $60 USD, let alone $100  USD for the Premium Edition. I'm reinstalling MK X.

65,50292541,english,"First and foremost, the gameplay of MK11 is solid. Based solely on the mechanics, I could easily recommend this game. There are two serious drawbacks though: Art Direction and Politics. 

I feel like the new art direction where all the female characters are covered because ""reasons"" but all of the male characters are still uncovered just rings of political correctness. I never really had a problem with the skimpy outfits in past games so I think its a weird change especially when they only changed one half. I'm not saying that I need the female fighters to have their breasts hanging out, but if Kano if fighting shirtless, it sort of takes away from the reasons for the change given by NRS. 

My second main complaint is the Politics injected into the game. Jax's ""Woke"" ending and the Shao Khan Trump reference really doesn't help the game any. Overall I still think its worth a buy from anyone who is interested in fighting games, but I really wish they would stay more true to the old art style and leave the politics out. 

The new gear system without the cumbersome stats tied in is nice, but there are still some issues with it. I'm not a fan of the microtransactions and wish they wouldn't try and cram those down our throats. Still, all things considered, I feel like this is a decent game and a good way to lose 30-50 hours depending on if you have any friends willing to play with you.

1) Frost can be unlocked by playing all parts with Sub-zero in chapter 4, so don't buy the DLC for Frost.
2) Combat and graphics are truly amazing. I have GTX 1060 and I can play on Ultra settings with 60 FPS.
3) Don't cry if your pc doesn't give you 60 FPS because it's not the game's problem. It's your problem.
4) Story is amazing. Combat is so fun and character design is amazing. Move sets so satisfying to use.
5) No game is perfect. But this game is really deserves the money.

[list]
[*] Game is fun but I didn't know if I was playing a mobile game with currencies or an actual MK game. 
[*] The krypt is just freakin messed up now with you not knowing what you are going to unlock and just one big fucking grind
[*] Speaking of the grind its awful and almost forces you to pay for things.
[*] But the story seemed like MKX which was a good one.
[*] The fighting well its MK but with more customization options for each fighter
[*] The net code actually seemed okay at launch
[*] Runs fine for me with only some wired hair issues and random crashes

Idk what people are going on about microtransactions for. So far its the same kinda deal as before: you play and get koins and go to the krypt to unlock stuff. The option for timeskip bs is there like most new games, but it seems up to the consumer if they want to buy the bs. It seems completely unnecessary to enjoy the game. Playing just a few towers I've already opened a bunch of chest in the krypt. I think peeps might be overreacting, but will be sure to keep my eyes open. 

I did have one crash on initial boot but then played a solid 2 and a half hours without any troubles whatsoever. Another issue is that the game seems real quiet at times. Most of the time I gotta drop stuff to like 50% ish on the mixer but this I have at 100% and it still is not that loud.

Overall tho having a pretty good time. Kombat feels good and once I turned the TAA off the weird blur crap stopped. Running solid 60fps except for the fatal blow moves but it doesnt seem as jarring as it was in MKX. Definitely an improvement. Krypt is also locked at 30fps which seems bizarre but is very playable so far as all I'm doing is opening chest and walking around. I'd still like to see that corrected tho if its possible.

I played this for 103 mins I was thoroughly enjoying myself seeing all the characters messing around with their move sets finding out what character I would ""main"". After I did some of the tutorials and finally found a character I liked (Geras) I decided to go check out the Krypt. BIG MISTAKE!

You're greeted by a character (who should be in the base game but will be sold as DLC) Shang Tsung, fan classic since original MK, he basically introduces you to his island (aka RNG loot box city) where you will wander around and spend all your coins on dumb-ass boxes to get random materials, art, skins etc. Except your chance of getting anything good is dog shit, you can't aim for any cosmetic you want on any certain character it's all fucking RNG and you can't earn anything in game outside of that and the terrible tower mode which is tuned to be insanely unfair in hopes you will pay with money to get farther!

When I was done with the RNG hell hole that is Now MK11 I decided I will go try my luck in some online games, Yikes don't even bother the connections are all terrible doesn't matter what it says you will get huge latency issues dropped inputs constantly no matter if the connection bar is green yellow etc. (I have 150mb download and 25upload and my ping is a constant 12 so no it's not my connection)

Overall Do not I repeat DO NOT!!! Support this type of shit this is disgusting predatory and a slap in the face to anyone who actually plays games, I paid 60 dollars yet for me to enjoy anyone or anything I'm expected to grind ludicrous amounts of time and effort in hopes I get lucky to get a brutality or skins or anything for 1 of the characters I play, that's disgusting!

This game is a joke, while the mechanics are nice the PC Port locked at 60 fps with the terrible server stability and the god awful microtransactions and basically Mobile gaming experience of MK11 should never ever be supported.

There are koncerns about the grindiness of the krypt. While I certainly kan appreciate having to unlock kustomizable items for your kharacter, I also admit that the kurrent system is a bit jank.

I suppose I'll address a lot of the negativity. This game launched with a very grindy system of unlocking cosmetics with the ability to skip the grind by buying in-game currency. This was unacceptable. However yesterday before launch the developers announced that they would be making it less grindy and they would be listening to customer feedback. They'd do this in a hotfix which I believe has now gone live instead of making the customers wait for a patch. It's a pretty good solution for a problem that honestly shouldn't have existed in the first place but I'm not going to give a negative review solely because of a purely cosmetic grind. 

The game play is absolutely fun with combos that range from easy to quite advanced, the characters are true to their lore and their movesets match their lore as well. The story is solid which is actually pretty surprising for a fighting game. The netcode is reallllllly good which is also surprising as that is often the downfall of fighting games especially on PC. 

All the gore and sass that you can expect from a Mortal Kombat title is intact. 

The character trials and tutorials are fantastic and this game has one of the better basics and combo tutorials out of any fighting game that I've played.

46,50291173,english,"Gameplay is tight and the game looks awesome. Lots of game modes.  Really enjoying the custom outfits etc. 

I see a lot of complaints that are a bit misleading.

1. Microtransactions are not as bad as people are making them out to be.  Literally everything (save maybe one outfit?) is unlockable by playing.  They simply put in a way to unlock stuff faster and skip content to get the reward through a purchasable currency.  This system is clearly designed to cater to the whales with extra dough to throw around.  I've already unlocked a lot of stuff i wanted pretty quickly and the rest well...i have something to look forward to in the days to come playing so not upset i don't have it day 1.

2. Lack of sexualized characters or some beef with it.   I dont know what this is about to be honest.  I think all the characters look great.  If you need less cloths on the girls or some S+M outfits well...perhaps those will come later but not what i bought the game for.  Its in DoA and i enjoy that game too but not necessarily because of it, i'm a gameplay first but also like characters to look cool whether that means they're fully dressed or not...so that one is more subjective i think but in my personal opinion everyone looks amazing. There is plenty of gameplay online where you can see some of their outfits and make that decision yourself.

Now to actual issues i have witnessed that i think deserve consideration.

1. Crashes.  Typical day 1 pc port for most console games and sadly many fighting games.   I have crashed mostly from the cosmetic menu.  I fortunately have never crashed mid match however and its not been that bad as long as i dont mess with the menu too long.

2. Graphics.   I havent had any issues here.  I have a 1060 gtx with most everything maxed and get 60 fps.  I have the latest graphics driver and nvidia set it up for me.  Dont know if thats why i'm having no issues.  Only concern is a couple times (i was alt tabbing a lot) i'd come back in and some of the textures during the intro would suddenly look fuzzy but then it would correct itself and go back to looking awesome.   Once again this is common sadly with early pc ports.  My guess is they'll probably fix it but yes its something to be concerned about and you should weigh that probability before you purchase.

I picked the game up last night and played a few hours. As a huge MK fan i was surprised how fun fighting turned out to be in this game, and the story mode is pretty enjoyable too.

At this game's core i could tell it was made with passion by Ed Boon and the team at NRS, but there's a nasty ass layer of cooperate greed from WB. It was bad in MKX and its worse here. When i first saw that Frost was locked my heart sank, and then on the store page it says 6 fucking dollers. THEN i find out through a Google search that she is unlocked after chapter 4 in story mode, but there is no info of that anywhere on the store page. I feel bad for the sorry people that got suckered in to buying her.

Ed Boon ""They'll be no loot boxes"" but the Krypt is 100% lootboxes with a fancy paint job. The timed towers are pure cancer, and the other grinds are awful. The manipulation is real here. Im so tired of the ""Its only cosmetic microtransactions"" NO!!!! NO MORE BS EXCUSES FOR THESE COMPANIES!!!! Everyone wants to customize their characters in a FULL AAA $60-$100 GAME and its horrible that companies are using that excuse and using our need for customization  to hold hostage.

Its so sad that this game is actually fun to play and that the online is smooth, but WB Games (and most AAA fighting games in general) just keep getting worse with the business practices and manipulation of the consumer. Its bad enough to justify spending $60 on a fighting game now a days (i love the genre but its sadly dying in replayability), but companies love to squeeze anything and everything from us that still love playing fighting games.

- Fluid combat
- Amazing tutorials for newcomers and even veterans
- Tons of customization

- Locks at 30fps during fatal blows, fatalities and The Krypt
- Bit of a grind to get stuff in the krypt (which i think they're patching soon)
- Microtransactions... I guess? Even though they are all literally used only for cosmetic shit which shouldn't bother anyone but thanks EA for ruining a perfectly fine business practice when done right...

I think that they took away many aspects of the game which made MK what it has always been. At least for me, I always loved it because it had fast paced fights, crazy combos and amazing character designs. Unfortunately, they took out the run feature and most of the old games combo capabilities, resulting in a slow, limited game that relies a lot more on footsies and projectile spam. It's like a child between Street Fighter and Injustice.  And don't even get me started on character design. The female characters look like they belong in a muslim country or something. Absolutely ridiculous and completely out of touch with the rest of the series.

Don't get me wrong, a lot of people might enjoy that, but it's just too different from what I grew up with. MKX had its problems, but it was an amazing iteration to the series precisely because it was developed under the concepts the made the series what it was.

Don't buy this game in its current state, and if you pre-ordered it,  maybe see if you can still return it.

The only people I'd recommend this title to are MK purists like myself, and even then, I'm feeling almost as ambivalent about this title as I was about MK vs DCU, maybe even MK: Special Forces. If those references go over your head, then as of launch week, I can think of no good reason for you to purchase this title. [b]If you're just a fighting game fan looking for a good, solid fighting game[/b] - look somewhere else. [b]If you're a newer fanboy who got into the series thanks to MK9 or MKX[/b] - stick with those two.

MK11 has lost Round One, but I wouldn't count it out just yet. If Boon and Co can address the criticism, it's still possible for a bloody comeback. And if not?

When it comes to micro-transactions these were also in the game for MKX. You could buy easy fatalities just like in this one. While it is a bit of an annoyance it is not anything gamebreaking.

What can I say...

Netherrealm studios gave console early release making PC users wait 14+ hours to receive their copy. They gave console users beta access when they pre ordered the game , PC did not. During their ""kombat kast"" on the day before release the entire chat was spamming what about the pc release , and to no avail did we get acknowledged. It's almost as if they were reading a sales script to the audience instead. Very robotic , and very disappointing. 

The game itself is AWESOME.

The graphics are so grainy this is due to some form of AA issue that wasnt address , defintely has tons of work to do. The audio is SO LOW that on MAX I can still barely hear  the game.

First off, the game runs very poorly, mostly capped at 30 fps and unstable and only capped at 60 fps very rarely. Even so the performance is shotty at best.

I don't even want to touch the feminist stuff and SJW stuff but it definitely brings the game down.
 
Overall, the game is a severe disappointment, seeing the 9.0 review by IGN really helped the hype but in the end that game, while fun sometimes, feels almost incomplete and poorly optimised. It's as if it's a console port of some sort.

I was hype for MK11, After playing MK10 and enjoying it to the fullest on day one I figured this game was going to be good, if not better!

But I was wrong. After only playing for an hour I already want to refund. The graphics are so bland and tasteless, the characters don't even feel the same as their MK10 counter parts. The new ""Fatal blow"" system is cool, but virtually useless if you're any bit good at the game. As compared to X-rays in previous games, the Fatal blow system is bland. No inside destruction, No real strong feeling of breaking bones and nearly killing your opponent with a single combo. 

The difficulties are absolute garbage. Me being the tasteful man I am, decided to compare the difficulties. Very easy and Easy are what they say they are. Pretty simple, no real challenge.

First, they announced that the game will be available at the same time as all other platforms, but then we, PC gamers and Steam users, needed to wait another 20 hours just to play the game. 20 hours of waiting, trying to avoiding spoilers and your favorite streamers who play the game just not to ruin your first expression of the game. 20 hours of watching people play the game and enjoy it, having fun, and sharing experience. That's all happening while we need to wait 20 hours. I'm not even touching the subject of two betas that were not available on PC, which is totally disrespectful towards PC players, and absence of classic characters, such as Milena, Ermac, Triborg, Reptile, and many-many more.
