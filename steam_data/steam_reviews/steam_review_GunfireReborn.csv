19,Gunfire Reborn,77121301,english,"Gunfire Reborn is a wonderful FPS rogue-lite, with a satisfying game play loop that makes every run feel impactful thanks to its upgrade system. Each world is broken into 5 levels, 4 where you fight both normal and elite enemies, and 1 boss level. The levels themselves are procedurally generated, but the boss fights are always the same. At the end of each level, including after killing the boss, you get an upgrade that will allow you to put a point in one of 3 randomly selected character talents, which improve your abilities or add new properties to your abilities.

Pros:
-Gun play feels great, and mostly all feel unique. There are the obvious archetypes here (like a rocket launcher or a 3 burst assault rifle), but there are some unique guns too (like an automatic rifle that stores crits as energy for an alt fire that shoots rockets, or a weapon that looks like Zarya's gravity gun and shoots a gravity well like her ult, if you are familiar with Over Watch).
-Deaths don't feel cheap. While you can die very quickly in this game, I've yet to experience a death that felt like I had no control. Every death felt like I made a mistake.
-Killing enemies sometimes, and bosses always, drop soul essence, which allows you to upgrade both a general talent tree, as well as a smaller character specific talent line. Eventually, you can get a talent that allows you to bank a number of essence, meaning even a run where you get killed in the first level can have an impact on your progression.
-3 difficult modes, with rewards scaling to meet the increased challenge.
-Currently, 3 characters that each have a very different skill set, and a few different play styles based on how you upgrade after each level. The cat has abilities that lock down enemies, the dog dual wields and throws grenades, and the bird uses close range physical abilities to deal high damage and heal himself.

Cons:
-Early access, so there are some bugs. The majority I've come across are enemies having issues with path finding, though I have had some times where an enemy has just stopped doing anything.
-Controller settings are way too sensitive, and you can't bind to either stick click (R3/L3), so you have to take your thumb off the right stick in order to jump/dash/reload/change weapon. Obviously, M+K users won't have to worry about this.
-There are only 3 worlds, you always fight them in the same order, and the boss fights don't change as the difficulty increases other than they have more health. If you don't like repetition, you won't like the game in its current state.
-Due to the language barrier of the devs being from Hong Kong (and some times the formatting of the text box), there are some confusing translations on scroll and ability explanations.
-Game does not do a very good job of explaining some of the more high level ways of play, like how combining 2 of the 3 status effects (shock, fire, decay) can produce a more powerful effect (example: mixing shock and fire causes the afflicted enemy to be mind controlled for a short period, where they will attack and pull aggro from other enemies)
-Enemy AI isn't exactly great, and certain enemies can be kited in such a way that they can never hurt you while you kill them.
-Some elite enemies that appear in vaults can be a bit tanky, taking a lot of ammo to kill.",1601982330,1601982330,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,288,2,1493,1493,1439,1602003949,,

86,Gunfire Reborn,76959200,english,"This game is an amazing experience for the price.  Mix Borderlands with Slay the Spire, and you have some idea of what you're looking at.  

The gunplay feels really good already.  Borderlands is a really good point of comparison in this department.  There are a wide variety of guns that have their own mechanics, and then those come with different tiers of modifiers so different versions of the same gun can behave very differently.  And you'll see quite a variety of these guns, because you don't get to keep any of it- when the run ends, you start from the beginning, and don't keep your gear.

The gameplay is highly addictive- when you die, you do get to spend the points you earned into a persistent talent tree that will make the next run a little easier.  So then you're like, ""one more run.""  Next time, maybe you'll get the guns and gear to be even more badass and push a little further.

The options truly open up for you as you level, and you can feel yourself progressing with every death.  And you will die a lot, at first.  But then you unlock a wide array of guns and scrolls (bonuses that can completely change your style of play).  The talent tree unlocks whole dimensions to gear and the shop that aren't available at first. And you the player will get smarter, faster, wiser in the character skills you choose and the guns you keep and the scrolls you combine.

You're locked in as the versatile mage-cat for a good while, but rest assured that eventually you'll unlock other characters, and they play completely differently.  The dog is a dual-wielding but initially squishy dps powerhouse who can make the most of explosives and rapid fire weapons.  The bird is a close-range, mobile, survivable martial artist who typically favors shotguns.

The game is still in development, but I can say for certain that it is worth the $12 price tag if you enjoy cooperative fps games with a rogue-lite twist.  An amazing experience with friends, since you can share any gun or scroll you come across to help each other build your characters.  But I've had really good experiences with the match-making system and internet randoms, even though I play at very odd times.

A seriously fun shooter with a lot going for it, great gun play, fun progression system its just a solid early access game. Only issue is the dash and character movement is so slow, yes there are buffs but your not always guaranteed to find them, which for those of us that enjoy a solo sessions really spoils the game as many enemies off the bat move faster then you, especially certain attacks where they move even fast then before, or start to spam attacks to an extent you cant move out the way it just becomes a trap you cant escape and i don't really understand why they haven't sorted this?

Got this game after feeling a little burnt out on other rogue-like shooters. Saw gameplay online and was pleasantly surprised when I jumped in, at how easily I acclimated to the game when I finally jumped in myself. 

There's a little something for all of my interests here : Guns, Powerups, God like synergies, Skill trees that carry over, smooth  progression (so far), character options, randomized inscriptions on weapons that can also roll really good buffs, and loads of other loot you unlock while playing by completing certain tasks. 

My one gripe is the xp that carries over. once you are done with a run you use the 'spirits' to unlock skills on the skill tree. Now while I have yet to have had a run where I couldn't at least increase one thing, I find myself being bummed out at the left over xp that is essentially lost when you exit the skill tree . I see the skill that increases it but have not had a run good enough to actually get the skill to save the limited amount of spirits I can carry over. 

Other than that one small problem I've run into, I think this is a stellar game and can't wait to see it be developed further, even though I genuinely feel like they have an incredibly solid starting place. I'm really excited for more levels and enemies. I really enjoy the random gun functions they've added and am really looking forward to more innovation like what I've seen, not only with the guns themselves, but the affixes that can randomly spawn with them and make a pretty okay gun GREAT.",1601459187,1601459187,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,17,4,848,805,423,1602051550,,

Pros:
   Cute aesthetic. 
   Bullet registration seems incredibly accurate. 
   Looks great, lots of graphics options. 
Cons :   
   Also your weapons reset every play through, so you only get to start with the one initial weapon. So if you are expecting like destiny or borderlands 3 where you get to keep your gun and upgrade that permanently this is not like that at all. 
   Talent tree skill caps - For example, HP talent you can only put 5 points in it, the point of rogue like games is to feel rewarded for the grind, a direct correlation between time spent in game and your power level(with a little luck of course ;)). 
   Repetitive, You run the same mission over and over, and souls don't carry over so it makes it even worse if you aren't skilled enough to beat the mission. 
   I would love to see a run mechanic, and slide mechanic, would make the game feel much more fluid

73,Gunfire Reborn,70624289,english,"Its heart is in the right place, it really is, but it's flawed. Deeply flawed.

Gunfire Reborn is a SOLID FPS, but It is a not a good Roguelite.

First, the positives.
The frame rate is fantastic and the movement is beautiful, save for some weird choppiness in a single player game one time that didn't affect me all that much,  (It was effectively the same speed but the pace was inconsistent.) unless you're in multiplayer, in which case there may be issues, which is a problem in a movement based shooter like this one.

 Accuracy is mostly based on your own aim  (For balancing purposes, thankfully) and the dodging and dashing away from enemy fire is very effective, rewarding navigating through all the projectiles enemies throw at you, but not too much to where it's OP. The encounter design is fantastic and despite being chunk based (At least it seems that way) it mostly makes good use of the room composition and enemy design to create pretty good fights.The weapons range from conservative to experimental with an equally varied range of effectiveness, but it's analyzing these weapons and their stats, their traits and how they interact with you and the rest of the game that it really begins to show the aforementioned deep flaws of this game. 

The translation job for this game is not great and it can hurt the gameplay by providing unclear descriptions, and although i complained about this in an earlier iteration of this review, it is worth noting that the issue is now drastically reduced and is now just a matter of less than optimal sentence structure rather than entirely misleading descriptions.

Determining the effectiveness of weapons and elemental damage early in your tenure, both ingame and in concept is very iffy, which is an issue when you only have two spare weapon slots. (You cannot drop the starting one.) In the first zone, the health bars of enemies with shields (Not armor though, oddly) aren't really treated all that differently compared to base health, but then ramps up extensively in the second zone, especially if the enemy has modifiers applied to them to make them tougher. Compound this with damage numbers being used to denote damage values to enemies whose health is shown via a bar with no numbers (Though bosses are an exception, oddly) and it becomes less effective at denoting how effective a weapon is, save for a comparative frame of reference between the weapons you use yourself, and with the limitations on your arsenal, you're not really going to get many opportunities to check that out, especially since the meta devolves into requiring you to cover your elemental weaknesses by the second or third zone (Though this is now due to deliberately tanky enemies in general compared to every enemy with an extra shield in the zone) lest you should throw away the run due to how long fights can take without them.

Character progression when you die is also concerning (One extremely so) based on its design. It's built and balanced around innate traits tied to you, the player, in both ascension and overall player level.
Ascension is fine but can screw you over sometimes. These levels are tied to the run and apply modifiers to you or your abilities, and when you are presented with the opportunity to get one, you are presented with one of three options that may or may not synergize with your build. I get that if left entirely to choice the game would have to be balanced around minmaxed offensive builds and that's kinda dumb to be honest, especially in a rogue-esque game in general, but it becomes a pain when you have to rely on good builds that RNG could screw you out of after the second zone. 
Player level is what picks up the slack, though in my opinion it really, REALLY shouldn't. The game is balanced in part around permanent upgrades, and this is evident through straight stat increases and features being unlocked, such as unlocking the ability to find ultra-powerful weapons, buffing their spawn chances, ability buffs that stay permanently, and worst of all, getting direct HP, shield and overall damage reduction buffs.
I get that there needs to be some overall progression to keep the game interesting, but the game already does that by giving out new weapons and abilities as milestone rewards, and that works wonderfully already. Leaning on that sort of progression and balancing the game around not having this levelling system will make the game more skill based and more player friendly, since there should be absolutely no reason to grind out a game like this and the player won't be cheaped out by bosses balanced around inherent damage reductions they have to grind lower area tiered runs to achieve. It makes the game longer, and not in the fun way.

The first boss, Wu Lu, is designed and balanced to be basically a QTE that literally requires you to dash out of their attacks if and when you can dodge them to begin with. A couple times he'll just charge you and there's hardly anything you can do to avoid his attacks. It's not fun to fight against, it's just bad. The amount of damage he deals can kill you pretty easily, too, and you can't really build yourself up defensively to deal with it, ironically making a decent chunk of your starting/early arsenal unviable against him (As some weapons have movement reductions when they're out) because if you use them at the wrong time during the fight, you're basically dead since he usually twoshots you. Given he's literally the first boss, this is not a good impression to make for people picking up the game, as it's not hard to reach him. The first time  i beat him i had to cheese him using stuns that i had to build my entire character around.

Your reward for defeating him is to actually move onto the further zones which are actually way better than the first in terms of roguelite gameplay. Arcadey enemy modifiers and slightly ramped up difficulty that factors in elemental weapon balancing in a genuine way, unlike the starting area, where weapon elements basically meant what flavor you wanted to kill things with some buffs attached if you build into that element. The second zone's boss is also semi-representative of what a boss should be but its damage values on one of its attacks effectively ensures your death if you do not get out of it in time.

I will say this though, these devs have a good history with a decent amount of accolades under their belt and they've got a built in feedback feature, and with the community engagement they have, it's clear they're genuinely trying to improve the game, and they have the potential to do it. Though i'll admit i'm unfamiliar with this particular company, I believe they will work to improve this game and i look forward to seeing this improved upon and completed.",1591874926,1601286631,TRUE,1,0,0.523809552,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,221,55,1196,163,1196,1601278440,,

- Levels are drab, uninteresting. Environments in this game are just BORING to look at. Art-style is one thing, but this game is just BORING all around. Look at the cherry picked screenshots, do you see anything that says ""Wow!""? No.

6,Gunfire Reborn,76625761,english,"I can't believe I haven't already recomended this game.

Certainly it has a few issues but it is consistantly updated, has amazing mecahnics and whatever you hear, no it is not purely reliant on meta progression. While that does massively help make runs easier, a level 0 character can beat the final boss on hard mode, it takes a lot of luck, and tons of skill, but it is possible.

Learning the game is a bit tough since its constantly evolving and many things are bugged or nerfed or even buffed over time, but if you are on the fence about getting this game I highly recomend trying it out. If its not your thing so be it, not everything was made for everyone but I love almost every thing about this game.

Overall points:

Gunplay: Fluid, responsive, skill heavy, 10/10

Movement: A bit hard to get used to, but great once you have learned it, 9/10

Gun variance: Its no BL3, but it has a multitude of options, 7/10 (with every major update there are a few more guns added so this will likely go out of date quickly)

Build variance: There are a few good ways to build each of the 3 characters, but almost always one extremely powerful build and about 2 other minor ones, 8/10

Meta Progression: This is a bit of a major make or break point of these games, and I believe that it has been handled extremely well by the developers, the high end skills may seemingly cost enormous ammounts of essence, but after you unlock them, you should be completing runs consistantly. 9/10

Overall 8.5/10 (no thats not mathimatically accurate but its how I feel.) Would recomend.",1601161881,1601161881,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,208,9,3713,0,3713,1600284935,,

It's a Roguelike FPS with funny weaponery and scrolls that affects your build with passive effects in your current run.

You can also enhance your character after each run with ""souls"" collected during your previous one.

The gunfight is really good, weapons and enemies are pretty diverse and have different mechanics. There are also elites mobs like in Borderland.

The game may sometimes seems unbalanced but in fact it's the way Roguelike games work.
If you have good weapons and good scrolls (passive buffs and skills enhancements), you'll roll over enemies and levels but if you have bad ones, than you'll die fast. Classical Roguelike.

The game currently have 3 levels divided into several areas and one boss per level. They can hide secret areas that you will need to complete in order to win a rewardl. These secret areas feature platforming, combat or action challenges and can be very tricky. If you die in one of them, then your run ends...

If you even have a hint of desire to try this game out, just buy it. These types of developers are the ones who deserve our hard-earned money. I legitimately put this up there with the likes of Cogmind, Synthetik, and Hades as setting the bar for what we should expect in an early access roguelike.

As for the game itself it's a very fun roguelite FPS with some meta-progression in form of a ""talent tree"" that you upgrade using the souls that you collect from the monsters. For now the game features the following: 

- 3 bosses and 3 stages one for each boss
- 100+ occult scrolls which are basically upgrades (or downgrades) that you find during the run
- Fair amount of weapons
- Co-op mode with pings system
- Dynamic combat based on skill rather than luck unlike many other roguelites. The game doesn't kill you in unfair ways and many attacks are telegraphed so you have enough time to react.
- 3 playable characters

The devs are incredibly active and push out an update roughly every week. Sometimes it's something small like minor balance changes to a few things and sometimes they're major like a new characters, stages or bosses.

TL;DR

Buy the game. It's great and the devs actually listen to the community. Frequent updates and no dodgy microtransactions or DLCs that block game content. Overall a steal for this price.

For those uninitiated, you pick a character(out of 3 as of this writing), each with their own abilities and get as far as you can while getting powerups and randomized loot along the way. There are some abilities that are clearly way better than others and the first character seems much stronger than the others, but that's something that can always be balanced later. The gameplay has a good feeling though I'm very terrible at the jump puzzles. A ton of weapon and enemy variety with some nice bosses that don't feel unfair. 

It's still in early access and thus there's still work to be done but it's in a decent shape right now. I do hope there'll be more upgrades and characters to unlock in the future.

For now, here's a quick Pros & Cons list. For those who are interested in a more in depth review, feel free to continue reading :)

[b] [u] Pros:[/u] [/b]
+ Great gunplay 
+ Fluent movement
+ Several playable characters to choose from
+ Expanding arsenal of unique weapons and skills
+ Several dificulties with well done learning curve
+ Detailed enviroments, great enemy design and unique artstyle
+ Well done Coop Mode
+ Constant updates and support by developers

[b] [u] Cons:[/u] [/b]
- Balancing of weapons, skills and characters varies from update to update
- Lacking choice making resulting in less skill/weapon management and brainless playstyles
- Limited amount of skills results in most runs having about the same bunch of skills
- With only 3 Areas and bosses rather short
- In general lacking content 

[i]Gunfire Reborn is a [b]First Person Shooter Rogue-Like[/b] which is currently in [b]early access[/b] and is being updated frequently. Right now you can choose one of three different ""Heroes"", each with their own abilities and specialization to enter a somewhat procedurally generated dungeon with up to 3 other players in  Co-Op or on your own, fighting either from one room to another or agains waves of enemies. A single playthrough currently features 3 different Worlds, each with several stages and a boss stage at the end of each of them. During all this you unluck different abilities by finishing stages, can collect new weapons from enemies (or unlock new ones once certain requirements have been met) and earn money and ""Soul Essence"", a currency used to upgrade the gear you carry or buff your character permanenty after each run.[/i]

Now that that's out of the way, [b]would I reccomend Gunfire Reborn? Short answer yes.[/b]
The game shines with its charming stage and enemy designes, interesting characters, weapons and abilities along with the differnt playstyles you can chose from, [b]fluent movement and just generally great controls[/b] as well as a devoted developer updating the game regularly. Most of the weapons are rather unique but all of them play pretty well, same goes for the different characters and their unique traits. A single game can take as little as [b]20 but also up to 40mins[/b] depending on you playstyle, experience and progress in the game. DIfferent enemies and especially bosses that might seem difficult in the beginning will probably not be a problem anymore if you give it enough tries and finally beating them feels [b]satisfying without seeming too tedious[/b]. The Co-Op mode, while buggy in the beginning is now in a rather good state with relatively good connection while giving the players more options than before like the sharing of loot among each other.

That said, [b]is the game perfect? Short answer, no...[/b]
Gunfire Reborn is as mentioned before an [b]early access[/b] title which, while being updated frequently, is still [b]far from perfectly polished or finished[/b]. [b]Weapons or skill might seem under- or overpowered[/b] at times making [b]some playstyles or characters far superior[/b] of a choice. Skills that were previously balanced by having strong effects with a bit of a drawback are now simple boosts and less thought has to go into skill/weapon management. Overall, the game lacks balance at times and doesn't present the player with proper choice making as most skills are simply buffs (with some but few exceptions) and can be taken blindly. [b]Another issue is (and I know this might seem a bit obvious) the lenght of the game and it's total content[/b]. Yes, the game is great and takes some time to get into/master but once you've defeated the third and currently last boss it's just over. After getting the hang of the game you spend about half an hour on average, trying to do the same stages over and over again or farm for Soul Essence to max out skills. After all skills have been maxed there really isn't much to do right now. It is of course only natural for an early access title to not have the same amount of content as a polished AAA title. I get that and never would I expect that but it should be mentioned that there simply are the same problems with about every other early access game there is. That said, the constant updates show that the developer is still very much invested in this project and tries to improve it with every update.",1600975923,1600976272,TRUE,1,0,0.521739125,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,127,14,4960,55,4904,1601412485,,

This is the BEST fps roguelike game that exists right now, and while the content is light, the dev's communication and update frequency is fantastic. In its current state it is worth playing and will provide a ton of fun and addicting gameplay for a great price.

+Good variety of skills and weapons 
+VERY satisfying gunplay
+Skill based - even tho RNG is a factor
+Kills and deaths feel fair
+Seems simple at first, but gets way harder and complex as it goes on
+Really great setting, theme, style and music

+Enemy types and variety are standard, but in a good way. It mixes things up and the enemy types compliment each other better than I've seen in other PvE's. This is probably due to the smaller spaces that you fight in. Which is a bit of a con.
+3 pretty unique characters with their own skills
+Lots of charm
+Cute, yet somehow still badass character designs. Main character is just a way cooler version of Puss in Boots

-Maps aren't too varied
-Maps are pretty plain looking. But if Risk of Rain 2 can get away with it, surely this can? It's down to taste.
-Movement/arenas feel a bit cramped. Although it might be by design, I would still love to see more things done with the maps. Such as jump pads or teleporters.

[i]I'm choosing to make this review in response to a handful of recent negative reviews the game has received, almost all of which they don't deserve.[/i]

And because the game is awesome.

Gunfire: Reborn is a superb model for an EA game. The [b]weapons[/b] are super fun and have great mechanics behind them. There is large number of weapons and the random element plays into what modifier and stat changes they get, two guns wont ever exactly be alike. 

The [b]characters[/b] are little but have the neccessary and strong abilities you'd find in a rouge game, dashes, AoEs and stuns. Each character doesn't have that much unique progression, but rather share a greater skill tree that your goal is to eventually fill. 

The [b]bosses[/b] are dope, there are only 3 major stages and 3 major bosses (excluding elites for now) but they each match their area and have respective defenses. You will see the same areas over and over, but each one has different entrances and routes through them. Hasn't been too repetitive so far. 

The [b]combat[/b] kicks ass, the gun play and movement lets you always have control, the guns don't feel slow or weighed down and the game has Warframe-like element combinations you can create for stronger combos again defenses or for status effects, even more so in co-op. 

The [b]co-op[/b] is great, the loot is all client side so there isn't stealing or trolling, you get your own unique loot and no one can stop you. They could just not revive you, but thats just how public co-op works. 

The [b]matchmaking[/b] is peer-to-peer so if there aren't many players online, expect to get players from farther away and with worse ping, but with the game rising in popularity, this wont be a problem for long. Even without friends I was able to get players who chatted and worked together!

I'll leave the rest for you to decide about the game, its super fun and with a 10~ dollar price tag this was an instant buy for me. I greatly recommend this.",1598612918,1600736910,TRUE,1,0,0.521739125,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,387,13,3415,632,2728,1601716974,,

The gameplay mechanics are fenomenal. It just makes you wanna play again and again......and again :P

It just so addicting, with all the upgrades and weapons, no run is gonna be the same, and you really need to stay on your toes while playing, because even if i unlocked all upgrades and weapons on all three classes, and i feel really powerful, a moment of loss of focus is enough to kill you or severely damage you , and that's one of the things I love about this game.

To unlock weapons and scrolls ( scrolls are all kinds of upgrades for abilities, weapons HP and more) you need to kill enemies in a variety of ways, with different elemental damage, melee, groups and more.

86,Gunfire Reborn,76214908,english,"The best game I've played under $20 in a very long time. A good combination of a loot shooter and a roguelite. 

Pros:
-Gunplay feels solid, not much at all bullet sponge, which is always my biggest complaint about any FPS with RPG elements
-Just the right amount of weapons: few enough to not be confusing, but enough to keep it fresh and interesting
-Very fun power-ups that can ramp you up to feel godlike
-The three characters are all distinct and no one feels more powerful than another
-The game is updated pretty regularly
-Scales well for co-op. The most fun I've had playing a co-op game with friends in a long time
-Challenging, but fair

Cons:

- There are only 3 stages with 5-6 levels each (not including ""Vaults"" which are side areas for extra loot/power-ups).
- Very little procedural generation map-wise. There are only a few layouts. Sometimes you do them backwards, but it feels same-y after a few playthroughs.
- Translation/word usage can be bad/weak on a lot of the items/power-ups, making it not immediately clear what they do. There are a few items that I'm still not sure *exactly* what they do or how they work, and I have more than 100 hours in the game
- The difficulty curve in terms of the roguelite playthrough-to-playthrough progression is a little out of whack. I felt like during my first playthrough I was COMPLETELY underpowered and now that I'm max level and have every upgrade, I'm only slightly overpowered. Some of it was me being new to the game and just getting better, but not most of it. I think certain upgrades are must-haves to make the difficulty doable early on.
-Runs are pretty short, which is good and bad. At the end of some runs, I'm sad I can't keep going because there are only 3 levels!


Conclusion:
Overall, the game is very fun. I bought it on a whim and was very pleasantly surprised by it, especially from an unheard of developer out of Hong Kong. For me, this absolutely trumps a Triple A shooter like Borderlands in terms of gameplay (and you don't have to put up with the cringey jokes either): the guns never feel like peashooters, the power-ups are fun as hell and can make or break a run, and the difficulty never feels unfair. A lot of the cons I listed above are nitpicky, but my only real complaint is that there's not enough game yet! I want more levels to play, more bosses, and different environments! I think this game is already such a breath of fresh air, and I want more replayability because I already genuinely love the unfinished product.",1600508117,1600508117,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,372,5,7623,216,7353,1601692435,,

8,Gunfire Reborn,76047068,english,"This game took me by surprise. I did read the positive reviews surrounding it, but most simply relativized it to its price with phrasing such as ""it's a steal for only 10 bucks!"". Having played it first hand at long last I can see why ""Gunfire reborn"" gets all the praise. Not merely from a value perspective, but as an excellent indie title and roguelite.

First and foremost: I went into this game having seen only a little gameplay and the store front. The latter doesn't really sell it particularly well if...well, you're not chinese. The game is littered throughout with poor denglish, spelling mistakes, poor grammar and generally embarrassing dialogue. It is in fact so bad some weapon effects are completely obscured by, presumably, Google translate. This was something I expected seeing the game's description and it turned out to be arguably even worse than I anticipated.

Secondly the game looks very ""generic"" from the screenshots. Even though not necessarily untrue this did not bother me in the slightest when playing. Granted a lot of the enemies are recycled in the currently three biomes, but due to the game's excellent pacing you'll be distracted from the fact you're pretty much shooting at the same few baddies(especially the first biome, the tombs, are a big offender as there's very little visual variation in the mobs).

The low poly graphics work. The animations are good. The pacing is really good. I would even go as far as to say the pacing in this game is one of the best I've ever seen in a roguelite. The game is definitely challenging, but so far I've yet to encounter a ""oh come on that's just unfair""-moment. The loot is exciting to obtain and there are plenty of viable builds. The sound design, and this came as a surprise to me, is very good albeit minimal. The weapons really do have oomph. The game does require aim, but it's definitely not a twitch shooter. Overall it's more akin to games like Doom where skill is expressed through timely reactions. Combine the great pacing, great feel of the weapons, exciting loot with a game that is neither too hard nor too easy and you have an excellent indie title on your hands.

I must also praise the developers for the bold move of selling it for 10$. I think this worked wonders in retrospect as it's one of those games you get to pick up with spare wallet cash. And, like everyone else already stated, it's a steal for the price. It's an excellent well refined indie title.",1600219572,1600455832,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,93,88,4798,1643,1141,1602044176,,

17,Gunfire Reborn,75739666,english,"As a FPS, this game is a treat. Lots of guns, tough enemies and a little bit of rpg elements to spice it up.

As a roguelike, it's a trainwreck. Only game mechanics to master are ""Shoot  stuff"" and ""pray to rng daemon"", almost everything else is random. Weapons are random, skills are random, game mutators (aka scrolls) are random, sideroom portals are random. As far as I can tell, chances to get pass first bossfight are random too.

ED: few more notes after spending some quality time with the game.

There are even more weapons to unlock then I thought, and I am thoroughly impressed by this. Some may be questionable (i.e. I am not fond of sniper rifle whose projectiles are so slow enemies sidestep them without really trying) but there is still plenty enough to pick from.

I also like number and variety of enemies. And the fact that they don't go for quantity, but quality, so to speak. Although there are some ""ankle biters"" this game is not about smacking endless hordes of powerless grunts. You have to know them,  learn their attack modes and sequences by heart. Unfortunately, this is process of knowing your enemy usualy begins with getting instakilled by… something. This is not exactly helped by several major flaws that I hope will be fixed before game is out of EA. One is that enemies can shoot right through each other, Come on devs, it's 21st century, you can do collision physics. Other one is that enemies can track through obstacles. Wallhacking bastards. This one is particulary enjoyed by lifestealing monks in one of those ""game just randomly decided to kill you"" moments.

As for the bosses – I stand by what I written about first boss being essentialy random encounter. It's not that he is too hard, he is easy compared to second one. It's that second one is far enough ingame that you have good changes of getting somewhat working gear combination. First one, not so much. End result is that I get through harder one about half the time, while score for the easy one is about one in five (although it gets better with grinding souls). Sad  thing about this is that random skill build is otherwise a grand idea.

Boasting about random levels is a bit premature. Right now, it's just a bunch or premade corridors, of which there is so few you will see them all in a two or three runs. Portals with trap minigames are a nice change of style. I would very much like to praise simple and clear art style of combat arenas, but I just can't. Because fast paced combat with lot of running and dodging does not go well with invisible walls, no matter how good it looks. In a game where a single mistake can kill you, this is literally showstopper. Third episode is especially guilty here, and while I can ignore that it looks like it was crudely upscaled, maybe even inept use of cover, but constant bumping into invisible walls is unforgivable.

What I can and will praise are those few cases when game froze upon death. Not that I like game bugs that much, but I was pleasantly surprised that upon restart I was able to recover those hard earned soul points. I wonder why it only ever had problems with death, never during fights, but it's not like I mind :-) Anyway, kudos to devs.

In the end, game have a solid and enjoyable core, lots of small bugs that will be easily ironed out during EA and with something like forty hours I can't honestly call it bad.

Cons:-

- Can become repetitive after 10-15 hours
- Some RNG element involved
- Bosses become quite easy after a few clears
- Vault runs can be lost sometimes because of the location (Act 2 for example, the vault icon is yellow which is very similar to the level design)

This is a simple little rouge-lite shooter from a small developer in Hong Kong. There's only 3 levels (with multiple stages per level) right now- and 3 different characters. If you're ok with that though- this is a fun little shooter with some varying tactics and synergies. It's ok solo but more enjoyable as a coop game. Randomized drops often make it beneficial to trade/give your drops to teammates that could make better use of them. Coop is actually encouraged by some of the mechanics and that is a good thing.

The genre isn't usually my cup of tea- but i've found myself enjoying this game.

The devs are fairly active and seem to respond to player feedback. lobby screen ambient sounds were a bit annoying and character voices can get obnoxious- giving feedback about this resulted in the addition of features to lower the volume or silence them entirely. In general- bugs get fixed, desired features get added. As it's still in active development and things are still being added, fixed, and optimized- I really can't complain.

40,Gunfire Reborn,76142347,english,"-> Gunfire Reborn is a good game. I payed full price and played a lot. I found this smooth, intense FPS co-op lobby shooter game to be free of un-fun busywork and free of micro-transactions. There is no story arc and only a couple of drone NPCs. The difficulty spikes are excessive as of the date of this review. The cartoon graphics won't appeal to everyone, similar to Borderlands. Overall, this is a good game with a likelihood of getting even better, since the game is technically still in development as of September 2020.

 -> At its heart, this game is an old-school 3D first-person shooter. You will be looking at the world from the center of your own hitbox, with your weapon or weapons visible in the lower corners and a reticle (aimpoint) in the center of the screen. You enter the game world from a bare-bones lobby, which saves you the time you might otherwise waste hiking to where the action is. The lobby does not need to be much, because there is one series of maps as of the date of this review. Luckily, the maps are randomly re-generated for each successive play-through. 

 -> The game is the good kind of rogue-like. Survive as long as you can, and you will harvest soul coins that you trade for permanent power-ups when you die. Your survival will be heavily influenced by your skill, obviously, but also by synergies that you create by selecting which weapons to carry and which temporary power-ups you select from loot boxes found at fixed intervals. The gameplay loop consists of building temporary synergies that persist until you die, then upon demise cashing in the harvested soul coins for permanent, persistent improvements. It's compelling, and it's fun. 

 -> Once you start to get good, play sessions will start getting longer than is comfortable for an intense shooter. Half an hour or 45 minutes is about my comfort level. You can save and quit at the transition between maps, which is generally at around the 45 minute mark. Then, when you return later, you can pick up where you left off. There are also rare scrolls that give extra lives, and once each play-through you can trade half your soul coins for an extra life (not usually a  good idea). Finally, since monsters do not repopulate, you can simply stop playing and leave your avatar in the game doing nothing while you take care of real world necessities. Other than that, I did not see any way to save a game in progress.

 -> Gunfire Reborn has no story that I can discern. Something along the lines of Borderlands' Handsome Jack taunting you would add a lot to the game. 

 -> Part of the game's progression requires that you die every so often, so it shouldn't be surprising that there are heavy difficulty spikes in this game. Bosses at the end of each zone or environment are one such difficulty spike; that's to be expected. Random minibosses can be much more difficult than end-level bosses, however. You might walk into a small room, hear the door crash shut behind you, and be faced with a bullet sponge miniboss with a terrific short-range attack that you can't get away from. Time to cash in those soul chips. Also certain randomly-placed rooms can be swarming with a dangerous blend of short and long range attackers while any available cover is effectively nullified by grenade spam. These uncommon death rooms are highly challenging, with survival rare.

 -> The graphics are cartoonish, with heavy outlines and cell shading added in video post-processing. I found it to be clean and approachable. If you liked Borderlands, you will feel right at home. 

 -> Gunfire Reborn is worth the money and, more importantly, worth your time. It's a lobby-based FPS rogue-like with temporary and permanent RPG elements. I looks and plays a lot like Borderlands, without story elements, a persistent universe, and NPCs with personalities. Gunfire Reborn is well done, and a blast.",1600381805,1600381805,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,221,23,8076,5281,719,1602043517,,

6,Gunfire Reborn,75998791,english,"Let me start off with prefacing that I am not a big rogue-like nor rogue-lite fan. I've only really enjoyed Risk of Rain 2, and Noita, both of which are rogue-likes. The play-hours I have as of this review - 16h-ish according to Steam, yet my steam overlay told me I had about 24hrs - are all within the first 24-ish hours of even owning this game. The first thing that grabbed me was the gunplay. My [i]god[/b] is it smooth! All the guns feel great to use, even better, most of them feel extremely viable and with tight and fun designs. The same proficiency in design is highlighted like the birth of christ in the characters. All three, while being relatively few for a character-based rogue-lite like this, feel extremely fun and viable to use. It's clear a lot of thought went into the designs of the characters, not only in their abilities and ascention trees (skill trees), but also in their character designs. The game also has a low-poly art style, with some of the weapons having more details. This works extremely well, not only for the, in my opinion, gorgeus aesthetics, but also for visibility and playability. The game runs like butter on max settings on a GTX 1060 3GB and a Ryzen 5 1600x and 8 gigs of ram. All three ""worlds"" are visually pleasing and interesting in their own ways, with the latter two being incredibly good looking in my opinion. I played this for most of my hours alone, yet I managed to convince some friends to buy the game after screensharing with them on Discord, and thanks to the low price it was an easy sell. From the moment 3 of them bought the game, up until the writing of this review, I've been playing it with them. It's currently 4:23 AM and as I checked my Steam Overlay in-game, I had been in-game for approximately 5-6 hours in just that single session of playing with them.

41,Gunfire Reborn,75977862,english,"One of my favorite Roguelites to date! I find the graphics style incredibly pleasing and easy on the eyes. It's very easy to distinguish what's going on in game visually.

I'll try a pro/con list for this review:

Pros:

*Visually pleasing
*Good in game sound track
*Super responsive controls(everything feels nice and tight)
*Interesting weapon choices and combinations
*3 characters to choose from each focusing on a different playstyle
*Tons of replayability
*Very difficult(feels fair, but RNG can be against you and cause your run to end early)
*Online Coop up to 4 people. It's P2P(peer 2 peer) connection, not dedicated servers just so you're aware. Largely online games go smoothly but you might experience minor lag randomly. As of 9/14/20 there is a bug that when typing in online coop, my game freezes and crashes Steam. As long as I don't type, I have no issue. (I'm sure this will be addressed at some point, I'm also sure that I'll not remember to update this review when it is)


Cons:

*English Translations are still a little rough, but you can largely understand what the descriptions are getting at.

*Very grindy. There is a meta progression that you level up after each run that make subsequent runs easier. Some skills increase damage, ammo capacity, health/shields/armor, or reduce damage taken. After becoming more comfortable with the mechanics of the game, I haven't gone back and tried playing on a fresh save. It feels, especially when you're first starting out, like you NEED the damage reduction and increased shields/health just to stay alive. The game almost seems impossible without those boosts.
------I will add that I do enjoy the grind, the further down the tree you go, the more smoothly your runs will go and it gives you something else to look forward to, besides just gameplay.

*Some guns are just plain better than others. After playing the game for about 5-10 hours it becomes pretty clear which guns you should avoid after the first level because they just aren't as good compared with others. The Kunai weapons are just too strong when compared with the other weapons, in my opinion. Or rather, the other weapons are too weak. I think the kunai are in a good place and that the other weapons(like the hippo) just need to be brought up to that same place.



Things I'm hoping are added in the future:
It would be nice to have additional characters in the future.
A more coherent story line
More guns added, with some of the weaker guns being buffed so they're useable.
I would also like to see stage/boss variants, I think that would be a great addition. Or to have separate missions to play through similar to the one mission we currently have.
Having a separate game mode that loops, similar to Risk of Rain2, would also be a really fun addition imo.




All in all, I highly recommend this game. It's already worth the price tag, and I'm sure it will only get better as they continue to update and improve this game throughout early access!

60,Gunfire Reborn,71650678,english,"So I know I don't have many hours into this game (only 11 at the time of review) but I feel like it's enough since I've gotten all the way to the current ""Final Boss""
Let me also say I'm not a roguelite player, this is technically my first ever dive into the series type in terms of playing one so I'm not an expert on this, just a casual player. With that being said, it's fun for what it is. If that's what you wanna know there you go no more reading for you, if you wanna know a bit more, well I got you. 
So first off, gameplay, it's an FPS with roguelite elements, what it says on the tin. You randomly find different guns and scrolls as you play and that helps you progress. Most guns seem to be unique in some form so they all have a clear advantage or disadvantage with various stats and extra modifiers. You may pick up a gun that boosts your crit chance, then you may find the exact same model of gun but it boosts your damage instead. Some guns may also come with an element while others are guaranteed to have one. 
As you kill enemies you get copper, that's your currency for the game. Randomly you can find the Peddler, who will sell you health, ammo, guns, and even some scrolls. Though you can only purchase said item once per stage so no infinite health. You could also run into the Craftsman, he'll boost your guns damage or later on reforge it to have some better modifiers. He too, like the Peddler, has a limit on how many times he can upgrade your weapon. He gives you two enhances per stage, though I'm not sure on reforges. They are guaranteed to be in the boss level so you can count on them to be there. 
Scrolls can sometimes be dropped by an enemy but mostly you'll find them in treasure rooms that require you to complete some sort of challenge, be it kill all enemies or an obstacle course. Scrolls are your boosts, from giving you ammo randomly, to boosting your crit damage, even giving a huge damage reduction at the caveat of taking more damage depending on the range the enemy is at. 
Next up is when you complete a stage you'll get a golden goblet that can give boosts to your character's abilities. Though I've only played as the cat and not the dog so I'm not sure what dog can get but cat can get element damage boosts, upgrades for his grenades, and make his ability have an AoE effect and increase its duration, just name a few. There's 18 total that you can pick and some have multiple levels, to make them better. 
Lastly is the talent tree. When you die, cause you will, you'll get the game over screen. The next screen is the talent tree which you spend souls to boost your character permanently. So each time you dive in, you dive in a bit stronger than before and it's a nice feeling. You'll get souls as you kill enemies and can even revive yourself at the cost of souls but it only works once per level so save it for when you absolutely need it if you can. Also whatever souls you don't use until you get a certain skill in the talent tree will be lost each new run so it's best to try and use every soul that you can each time.

Now onto Art Style. It's a unique style, for the 3D models go back to old school days of the 6th maybe even 5th generation of gaming (PS1/PS2) with the overall polygonal models. However, they are very polished and smooth so nothing looks super jarring or hard on the eyes. Everything from the guns to enemies to even the levels look very nice and I don't think I'll get tired of how it looks anytime soon. Also if you couldn't tell, the designs are very Asian/Eastern oriented. A lot of the weapons are designed with this Chinese aesthetic, and the first world is the same, even the boss. The second world is a bit more desert themed but I don't see a clear distinct style with it, maybe Egyptian but I could be very wrong. The third world is Japanese oriented, from enemies to level design, it just screams ""JAPAN!"" in a good way.

Multiplayer is essentially all of before, except enemies will be scaled based on how many players you have, and bosses will have more health. Get a good group that communicates and you can easily get all the things you want, be it your preferred gun or preferred scrolls. Yeah you can drop most scrolls so you can give your team mates the scrolls you don't want/need that may be very beneficial for them, which helps the group in the long run. Also if someone dies you can buy them back once from the peddler, though the further you go the more it'll cost to revive. 

Story... Bad guys showed up, you fight them, that's it. I mean that's it in a nutshell, you don't really get much more than that when starting, though there's plenty of lore that you can access from the logbook about some of the enemies. 
Anyway that's the good things, now onto some negatives. Though take some of these with a grain of salt and keep in mind that they may very well be nitpicks.

The game can go from 0-100 really quick if you don't know what you're doing or just get unlucky. Some enemies can be very annoying and can be encountered early on (Looking at you longbowman with bullets that can home in on you) though overall again this can mitigated by just playing the game and learning about the mechanics just a little. 

Multiplayer is a good thing for this game but the way it currently is, well it's not super bugged or anything but there's some slight annoyances to it. To start of, multiplayer is locked till you reach level 10, levels are defined by your talent tree, so it's better trying to use every soul you possibly can so that way you get most bang for your buck. I'm not sure if things are client based or not and if they are which ones that applies to. Had someone say the buns (aka health items) are client based so if you see one, that's yours. Though it sometimes seems like certain guns are client based too, until someone picks one up then drops it. So at times you're not sure what's client based or what's group based so you might be taking the gun someone else wanted to use. Then the multiplayer itself, there are no servers, it's all player to player. Meaning if you have a host with a bad connection or get paired with a group where you have high ping, expect a lot of issues. If there were some sort of setting to say ""Don't connect me to groups where my ping exceeds X amount"" it'd make groups a lot better. 
Now remember when I said obstacle courses for the treasure rooms? Yeah those things can give you a lot of trouble. Not the first ones, those are mostly timing based. No in the second world you can get these little parkour challenges and this game was not meant for platforming. Many times I swear I should've made the jump but the game said nope. On top of it there are moments where you have to essentially do a 180 around a wall for a jump. Even then those, while frustrating aren't as bad as the one you find in world 3. There's the one where you essentially cannot jump. They placed a ceiling above your head and there's no room to jump, forcing you to run forward and dash, which most likely will end up with you falling off. Now mind you these parkour challenges are optional in the treasure rooms but they give a Jade Chest. Jade Chests will give you 3 scrolls and you can pick which one you want instead of just being stuck with only one. But this parkour challenge is timed, take too long and no jade chest for you, which is very easily done if you don't spend a lot of time practicing the required jumps. 
Then my biggest issue with this game, is actually the best praise I can give it. There's just not enough to it. Though to be fair a 12 dollar game in early access that has given me 11 hours SO FAR is really great. So here's hoping we'll get more than 3 worlds and some more guns soon. 
So maybe pick it up yourself and play it. (Removed an issue that got fixed. Also they improved the jumping but still a bit tricky)",1593435258,1600053485,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,56,5,2013,0,2013,1598454149,,

5,Gunfire Reborn,75878615,english,"A neat little roguelite FPS. Reminiscent of Ziggurat for those who've played. Review based on 2 hours of solo play.

As with other Early Access FPS roguelites, it has some common issues related to balancing and RNG. There's randomized weapon and effect pickups, and sometimes the RNG does weird things and you get ridiculously overpowered items or total garbage. This is part of the fun of these kind of games, but I feel like I pickup too many borderline useless weapons/items. In my first couple of hours, I often found myself preferring the default weapon over pickups with undesirable stats, and I didn't care enough to adjust my play to conditional buffs from items (e.g., after you kill an enemy under some condition you gain X% damage for X seconds). But you can somewhat make up for bad items with FPS/twitch skills and the shooting with just basic guns feels solid.

Difficulty - game so far is surprisingly hard; I don't mind it but I feel like I take damage that I can't see/avoid. I'm not sure if it's an issue with visual representation of incoming damage or a hit detection thing. Either I shrug off damage that the self-replenishing shield heals with no problem, or I suddenly drop dead on my face with no idea of what killed me. No in-between of ""uh-oh, I'm in trouble, better hide."" I find myself hiding behind walls and peeking through the run. Maybe I'm just getting old.

Visual style - initially I hesitated to buy because I thought the visual style was too ""cute,"" but in-game it feels OK. It's definitely more whimsical than serious, and that helps to keep a difficult (so far) game fun and enjoyable.",1599956518,1599956649,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,164,2,478,0,115,1600552449,,

PROS
- Gunplay feels good overall with some interesting weapon mechanics. ""Casually serious"", as if Destiny 2, Borderlands and Overwatch (and perhaps Valorant) had a baby.
- Lovely simple art style. Cartoony with distinct polygons, which allows generally clear visuals.
- Loadout mechanics are clear enough from the first runs.
- The relative difference in movement between player (slow-ish but with burst with the cat's dash, for instance) and common enemies (multitude of enemies that can even move even faster than you) works fine and adds a slight strategic element.

CONS
- The levels of each stage, as mentioned by others too, are samey. At the very least, some more visual differentiation in the rooms in the spirit of the already easy to look upon art - style could work wonders. For instance, Immortal Redneck is a great example on how to keep rooms visually interesting with a vague insinuation that there is an interesting unspoken lore behind, even if they are semi - procedurally generated.
- The default weapon is nice and it is interesting that it scales, but it hinders the elemental combination mechanics. Personally I would like the ability to replace it, with the ability to re- acquire in the beginning of the next stage or buying it from a peddler, for instance. I realize that might require lots of re - balancing, but I think it can affect positively how good the game feels overall and play a bit more on the elemental mechanics that a good chunk of the gunplay is already based upon.
- Navigation around props / cover, as well as jumping on them could use some refinement. Especially the jump feels kind of weak. Also, additional props and slight map geometry changes can help with the verticality to make player navigation feel more engaging and reward a bit more active pursuing of enemies when the situation calls for it.
- Cat and 1st boss - specific nag time: the dash feels to me underpowered for the combination of the boss being both a jumper and a caster of a strong AOE. As a result, I feel forced to always keep a distance and save the dash mainly for the AOE or the leap, instead of getting rewarded for outmaneuvering in any other way apart from momentarily using the pillars. I am ok with the timing for avoiding attacks being tight, but a bit more movement for the player or smaller AOE on his attacks would feel better, even if the boss had more health to counter-balance that.
- Devs please allow for some crosshair refinement options, especially size and inaccuracy bloom!",1599950411,1599950634,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,40,6,1486,772,193,1601734947,,

At the moment their is only 3 characters you can play with each with their own play style and abilities. However what i do disagree with is that you have to be level 30 and level 40 to unlock these characters so the player is required to grind to unlock them. 

Not played co-op yet but you have to be level 10 to use the matchmaking feature which i think is a good idea because the game forces you to play solo for the first 10 levels of your character progression getting use to the game play, how abilities and scrolls and elemental powers work, but on the other hand it stops friends from playing together straight away.

in rouge like's/lites you do a run, you die, you start over. every time you restart you will be doing the same level first then the same level second, and what even more boring then that is each level has the same boss's and each level always has the same enemies. i dont know how people have put so many hrs into this game, but then again i do, modern gamer loves leveling up for the sake of leveling up. for me its just gotten really boring and repetitive, and there has been no sign that the devs plan on mixing up the levels and adding more boss's
more then the repetitiveness of this game, 
there are like 15 guns but depending on the character your playing you only ever want 2-3 of them and the rest are useless. you cant run, only walk and dash. and there is platforming in this game.
i recommend getting ziggaraut and risk of rain before buying this, when you start each run it wont be the same every time.

The rogue-like elements combined with FPS action make this game exciting and replayable. Each of the three characters pushes you into a different game-play style, and there are a variety of weapons and scrolls to collect. The scrolls give you buffs that typically last for the run. Many are random drops, but some drops give you a choice of 3, so they allow you to build yourself in your own way. There are also permanent upgrades you can get, allowing even the worst runs to give you some progress. There are also random inscriptions weapons can have, giving them different stat buffs each time. Despite there being only 3 locations, runs still approach 40min - 1hr. However after completing each location, you can save your progress and resume later. One of the perhaps best aspects of the game is its co-op. While drops are local for each player, they can choose to ""share"" it, making it available for anyone to grab. The game also has multiple difficulties, if you put in enough time to beat the final boss. Speaking of, the bosses will absolutely wreak you the first time you encounter them. They hit like trucks, but once you get their patterns, they aren't so bad. The permanent upgrades also let you dispatch them quicker.

Gunfire Reborn (GFR from here on out) is a diamond in the rough when it comes to the sheer amount of games that try to do what it does, and it does it in spades. Now this is not without complaint, of course. The game can feel stagnate with continuous runs feeling more-or-less the same, the same stages, going for the same builds that you as a player naturally tend to prefer as you unlock new guns, scrolls, and characters.

More often than not I felt like a new gun would just pale in comparison to a previously unlocked weapon (Prism, Glimmering, Talisman) that does what a new gun does, but better / more reliably. I definitely feel like guns with scopes are obsolete by time you get your hands on them, and never feel as powerful as the previously mentioned guns due to the nature of how they are used. However, this complaint just reinforces what the game tells you, that the game is all about finding your play style, not what is the best.

GFR while in Early Access at the time of writing this is a more complete game than most games that are released. While a bold statement, I say that with confidence. The team from what I can see are active, they listen to the community, and they care about the product they want to deliver.

Guns are satisfying to shoot, the hit markers are well thought out and provide nice feedback and a pleasing feeling when you get that critical.  So far levels seem to be well laid out, although at times feel cramped, especially with the mechanic of enemies spawning behind you. With more than one player, some will be too small. 

I can't say too much more, as I've only played an hour and a bit, but so far, really liking what I see. This is a game that you can hop into and play quickly, like a ten minute stint, without having to be re-immersed etc.

Some will dislike the passive/background advancement/skill tree of characters I'm sure, but I personally enjoy it. It's done in a what feels like balanced manner.

Just my thoughts so far, but very excited to see what's coming down the pipe.

45,Gunfire Reborn,75542243,english,"TLDR: buy it. 10 bucks is 1000% worth the buy here. 

Early access tho??. Never crashed, never had problems connecting to my friends. Didn't even have a clipping bug. The game doesn't feel empty like I was expecting. 40 hours in, I'm still in my addicted phase and I haven't finished the game on normal yet. 

There are 3 maps. In each map there are around 5 stages, with the last one being the boss. You start on the first map, go through all the stages until the boss, where you go to the next map. When you die, you upgrade your character with the soul essence enemies dropped and then start from scratch. Nothing but those upgrades and your trusty default pistol. 

Weapons will have random traits on them when they're dropped, at random, by enemies. You'll find abilities at the end of stages or around the map. Some are unique to your character, some are not. This means that each character will play very differently. Some weapons are hot garbage on one character and s+ tier on another. These abilities and traits MATTER. 

Do not be alarmed, however. The game gives you plenty of choices and opportunity. Although a lot of this game is random, the player's choices outweigh luck a vast majority of the time in this game. You'll find a vendor around that offers different guns if the ones you have aren't working for you. 

Gunplay is definitely praise-worthy here. Guns feel great, and even just the simple default weapon is enjoyable to use. The weapons are unique and have their own style. I can tell what weapon I'm picking up when it's on the ground, and I remember exactly what every single one does. 

Character control is a little wonky, I have to admit. You can turn in the air and shift directions at constant speed. It won't feel realistic. 
That said, the parkour levels they add into this game are oddly satisfying. You'll find them in portals around the map occasionally as a replacement to the normal enemy levels, but you won't have to do so much of it that it feels invasive. Some will hate it, some will love it. I really love it.

There are many types of enemies. Some will snipe at you from a distance while others will run into your face with a flamethrower. Some of the enemy design is so well that they almost give away what they are the first time you see them. The kamikaze boxes run straight at you with a dangerous glow. The hulking tanks slowly inch forward with a shield in front of them. The fragile looking snipers hide in the back, looking for a shot at you. I'm never trying to figure out which enemy I'm looking at, it's obvious. 

Although there's a lot to love about this game, there are still some minor complaints.

1. Gun balance. There are a few guns that seriously suck, no matter what I tried. Some guns are completely overpowered. I find myself looking for a few weapons, and then just using them the whole level. It's not that they're inherently bad, but buffs are probably in order. 
2. Wonky hitboxes. Especially on the 2nd boss, I can barely tell when something is going to hit me. At the same time, I can't tell where the weakspot for the boss is either. Sometimes it is the mouth, sometimes the chin. 


Overall, this game is amazing. AMAZING I tell you. You can feel the hard work the devs put into this game, and I applaud them for it. 
It's fun, it's addicting, it challenges the player in fair ways, and it most definitely is worth it's asking price.",1599397560,1599642103,TRUE,1,0,0.519999981,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,60,3,3416,0,659,1599797328,,

56,Gunfire Reborn,75564340,english,"Game in Early Access at time of purchase.

I paid ten quid for this game, and have gotten 55 hours at time of writing. 
After Gearbox mugged me off for £60 by removing a setting from BL3 8 MONTHS after the games release, rendering it unplayable to me, I was recommended this game from someone on the GBX forum.
 
I have several EA games from Humble monthly, but have never knowingly purchased one. Considering the price (£10) when I got it, and after watching a few gameplay videos, I decided to give it a try. 

A wise decision.

Pros:
3 Characters (so far) - With skill trees / Special abilities
3 Levels (so far) - Broken into several (4-5ish) mini-maps.
Several 'Vaults' within each Level.
Main Bosses - Sub Bosses - Unique Bosses
Many different enemies.
Shedload of weapons with unique abilities.
Another shedload of Scrolls.
Great gameplay (if maybe a little basic), with lots of variety.
Each run is different. 
Graphics fine.
Sound fine.
Controls fine(ish)
Re-playability - Through the roof.
Dev's constantly updating (and while not all updates / buffs / nerfs etc will please everyone, that's the EA purpose. 

Cons.

Key mapping needs a serious look at, especially for left handers.
Some additional sound sliders required for certain sounds. 
A couple of bugs (only two in 55 hours), that I have noticed.

That's about is for the cons. 

As a newcomer to this game type, I was initially a little frustrated at the beginning of playing this. I was not aware of the mechanics of a 'Rogue-lite' game. And progress initially seemed slow an arduous. Thankfully, the issue was BNIF (Big Nut In Front) ie, me!
And the main advice give on various forums, really is the only sound advice... Keep Playing. Build Your Souls. Level the character.
Do not expect to steamroller the first level immediately. Accept that failure is inevitable.

So that's my review. For an Early Access game. This thing is top-notch. The devs are active and responsive. The game runs smooth, gun-play is great.

Though i wish they added some randomness such as playing the other levels first (like the desert levels first instead of the castle) and have the enemies being brought down to an easier level. That and having the other playable characters be played at the start so not everyone is a cat and can find how you want to play the game with your friends or even allow.

-Skill progression is fun and always different 
-A lot of replay in a good way

Cons:
-Level designs are simple and don't allow for a lot of discovery
-Enemies can feel basic in early levels and take a few stage clears to get more interseting ones.
-The other playable characters are locked behind a level system that makes you play to unlock them which makes unlocking them taxing and wish they weren't locked away so you can actually play around and figure out your playstyle 
-A lot of replay in a bad way

No quests, no map travel, and no inventory hassle; it's all grab, go, and shoot. You can also play with up to three friends/randoms or just play solo.

The mechanics are tight and the gunplay is satisfying. Most of the weapons are uniquely fun and the current selection of characters are great to play, each offering multiple different playstyles depending on build. This is also the only roguelite in recent years that have me still hooked and playing long after a first win.

Perhaps my only gripe is the balancing.

The first 2 bosses are great, albeit on the easy side, with clear tells and enough leeway to dodge/react while on the other hand, the 3rd boss has instakills that gives you a much smaller time to react all the while throwing mechanics at you at a pace that felt disproportionate to the overall experience. 

Having finished a couple of runs in elite and trying for nightmare clear, not all weapons/ascensions are viable and some are just straight up bad, at least in my experience playing only on solo.

I am a mostly casual gamer these days and prefer coop games. This scratches the same itch for me as Borderlands, but is a simpler rogue-like FPS.

My friend and I struggle with the bosses, but your character gradually gets stronger over time (you get points to spend after a playthrough to permanently increase HPs, etc.), so you can eventually get through even if you're not so skilled at FPSs anymore like me :-)
The synchronicity between the various different weapons/scrolls/bonuses is great. You wind up playing very different styles depending on which you get (which is random, so if you only want to play a certain style that probably won't work so well).

the thing that makes this game great is how unique the scrolls are (and weapons to some degree,specifically the prefixes)
the synergies are fantastic the combination between weapon,weapon prefix,character,character talent and scrolls makes this game into a great game.

the RNG rooms are good not great but good.

60,Gunfire Reborn,75443844,english,"This game is super good and super content rich rn, even in its super early access state. But I'mma list the pros and cons anyways just so this is more concise. 
Pros
1.) Guns feel nice and solid, chunky hit and reload sound effects and super creative designs
2.) Enemies feel good to fight and have very unique reasons for existing, like the sniper exist so that you don't just run in and fuck everything up immediately and the knight horse guys exist to keep you on your toes, you have to ignore them but keep them in the back of your head while fighting grunt enemies so you can dodge their sword laser and kill them in time. 
3.) Characters are nice and diverse, we have a raw damage guy, a utility guy, and a melee guy, they all play super differently. 
4.) ART IS SO FUCKING GOOD
5.) Bosses are the most creative and fun parts of the game, they really truly feel like they challenge everything the gameplay teaches you up to the point to when you fight them. 
Cons
1.) Music fits the setting but is kinda meh
2.) The dash. This is my biggest gripe, the dash fills a super important role in allowing you to dodge homing enemy attacks or big telegraphed ones and plays a big part in the platforming. However, it doesnt feel snappy at all. You can see your character stuttering forward every time you dash, it doesn't feel like an instant dodge move because of that weird buggy stuttering. If this was fixed the game would feel a hell of a lot more smooth. 
3.) The amount of levels is a bit lacking but it's safe to assume this will be changed as more content gets added
4.) Amount of characters, but again, this will be changed as more stuff comes to the game. 
5.) We need more enemies with more unique weakpoints, I love the inspiration this game obviously takes from DOOM Eternal, by adding that dash, and allowing enemies to have attacks that aren't dodgeable without the dash, and focusing on enemy weakpoints so heavily, but I feel that we need more enemies that have weird weakpoints, like the huge black lizard dudes with the scar on their backs, or like the sand worm boss and how hes only weak to damage when his mouth is open. Maybe they could add like samurai enemies that have armor plates that you could shoot off to expose their weakpoint or something, I just love the idea of an enemy having that leeway of being basically invincible before you shoot its weak points off, like revenants or mancubus from DOOM Eternal. It allows the game to be more challenging while also staying fair. 
Overall, this game is a nice 7 right now, super fun to play, just really waiting for more content to be added, the biggest make or break for this game will probably be how unique they get with their enemy design later down the line, I'm a bit worried about it at the current moment because through all 3 of the ""worlds"" you go through in this game, there's a couple repeat enemies that share AI. But, in it's current state, it's a pretty good challenging roguelike.

I got this Early Access for a low price. Highly recommend doing the same. The game is way fun already and with each update things get better. The devs seem to be truly invested in continuing improvement and delivering a great product. KUDOS!

I love playing this while listening to a philosophy lecture or watching a goofy sitcom on a second monitor. Great way to decompress. I like that it rewards different play styles.

-More enemy weak points. Some of the enemies have massive health pools with a shield, and hitting them in the head is super difficult, since most of their hit-boxes are tall and slender; I would recommend putting 1 or 2 crit-points on tougher enemies to add variety to the gun play.
-Traps. I love the secret rooms that have traps. Please add more of those with maybe some puzzle solving thrown in. However, I would like to see more traps during the main dungeon crawl as well to add to combat. The traps would work on player and enemy alike.

Here's the idea behind how it works:

You'll start off playing as a cat (The Crown Prince) and progress through different stages battling enemies and gathering scrolls that offer semi-random buffs. There are 3 themed locations and 3 bosses to separate them. Should you die, you are offered the chance to revive (at a cost) or end the run. You only get one revive.  Then you power up your character, and do the run again. Growing more powerful with each run.

35,Gunfire Reborn,74992266,english,"Gunfire Reborn is another rouge-like shooter that has done a fantastic job of making the game as addictive as possible.

For most games, how I define the greatness for the most part is based on how re-playable the experience can be. And Gunfire knocks it right out of the park with that one.

Although Gunfire is still in Early Access with many changes and additions planned to make their way in, it already is super solid for how it is currently. It's enough for me to say that if it didn't have (EA) attached to it at the moment, I would definitely believe that it was a ready game.

Gunfire Reborn is just like Risk of Rain and Binding of Isaac and all other rogue likes in which when you die you start fresh, but it does a good job by still making you feel like you're progressing even though it's a restart for every session.

The game implements a very thorough Talent tree in which the profits you make in your runs can be easily converted to the skills you wish to enhance, to better off your upcoming runs in the future. With this, each skill you upgrade is also represented as your player level. The more skills you unlock, the higher level your account becomes. And when it doesn't come to replay ability, Leveling system is immediately the right hand man for what gets me hooked on a game.

The weapons in Gunfire are pretty self explanatory, they're guns. But for those who wish to use other means of attacking they put that into account too and also added cool gadgets and gizmos to use instead. Such as, a laser glove, a fire dragon, a whole lizard, and even primary skills that each unique character has catered to them.

Thankfully if one character doesn't suit your taste with their play style, they also have 2 additional ones currently that spice things up a little.

The list of characters and their specialties:

The Crown Prince (Cat): Elemental damage, Smoke Bomb usage/buffs, Energy Orb Primary skill.

Ao Bai (Dog): Gun improvements, overall sustainability perks, grenade buffs, Akimbo Gun Primary Skill

Qing Yan (Bird): Overall sustainability perks, winged attacks, Claw Leap Primary skill.

Although there may seem very few in character numbers, their uniqueness makes the game play experience completely different from each other.

The game also uses a very subtle elemental system of three elements: Corrosion, Fire, and Lightning. With these three elements, based on who you're fighting they may have an element that consists of their being. By figuring out which element counters which, you can choose the appropriate weapon to gain bonus damage on said enemy. As well as dealing less damage if the enemy element is countering your current weapon.

A complete run of a Gunfire session takes about an average of forty minutes minimum, and up to an hour or longer afterwards. Don't expect to win a session on your first try, but with the help of unlocking items and learning each enemy's combat styles, you'll be soaring through the rooms in no time.

I've had my eye on this game for quite some time and finally got the urge to complete the purchase and i'm shocked as to how much time it has already sucked from my day to day life. The matches are played so differently every time that once i'm finished I hop right back in and see what new situations I am put against to squeeze my way out of this time.

*It also has online co-op if you want to play with friends and the difficulty increases accordingly.
*There are currently 3 main bosses, mini bosses, secret rooms, platformer levels, a variety of weapons, different types of enemies, upgradeable weapons etc. 
*It's replayable and pretty fun. 
*It took me 36 hours to kill the final boss solo for the first time and then, I decided to write this review because I consider this game pretty underrated and It's still a work in progress. For this price tag, it's a steal. Just buy it.

40,Gunfire Reborn,75345431,english,"This is legitimately one of the best shooters I have played in recent memory. The gunplay is excellent (I would say it feels similar to the Destiny, which I think has fantastic gunplay), the levels are well designed, and the enemies are interesting enough to not get bored. 
Though the most outstanding aspects of the game, in my opinion, are the progression and the gun variety. The pace the game progresses (unlocking new guns, new abilities, earning money and upgrades, discovering secrets and game mechanics) is perfect. It's fast enough so that there is [u] always [/u] something new to unlock or play around with, but it's slow enough so that you never get overwhelmed and always have something you're looking forward to. The gun variety is also something that I find incredibly well done. There are all sorts of interesting, fun, and crazy guns- from your standard assault rifles, to crossbows, lasers, rocket launchers, miniguns, dragons, geckos, shirukens, and much more, this game has it all. Furthermore, all guns have their own interesting perks and progression and you unlock many guns by progressing in ways you didn't even know you were, giving you a surprise new, interesting, and upgraded gun as a reward in one of your runs, which feels good every time. I could go on for many more paragraphs about how much I enjoy this game, but I think I've made my point. 
I will say, however, that I am personally not a big fan of the visuals, though I certainly don't think they should be a reason to not get this game. I have also not tried out co-op mode so far, so I cannot say how (well) co-op works and if there are any problems there that I have missed. 
Overall, I think this game is a nearly 10/10 game for almost anyone that enjoys shooters and I highly recommend it to anyone wanting to try something new.",1599081052,1599081052,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,108,20,3246,263,1834,1601913335,,

48,Gunfire Reborn,75332920,english,"""Wow, a roguelike with multiplayer FPS gameplay, what a good idea !"" That's what you might think. But you should be careful. The idea is good, the execution is frustrating and near to bad.

- Not enough variety in enemies and rooms patterns
- Items synergizing negatively (yes, you can have no more shield and 1 max hp)
- Not finding movement speed upgrades means that you will die, no matter how good you are. There are plenty of enemies able to one shot you, run faster than you, dash at you more often than you are able to dash.
- You finally have a good combo of items ? Let the game bring you the tankiest mob you will ever see. It will run faster than you and will slow you down
- The game is not made for solo players. Multiplier is mendatory since your mates can resurect you. So the one shot from ennemies is less punishing.
- You feel like you have no damages against bosses, elites and enemies with some weird modifiers. why the first boss has 200k damages when my pistol doesn't do more than 200 damages ? I don't know. Does the boss need to regen his shield several times during the fight ? Oh no, he doesn't

After 18 hours in the game, I am finally able to unlock skills at the end of the skill tree. Too bad that 1 run only allows me to upgrade 1 skill at a time because the currency is so rare or just because the costs are stupid.

Good point of this game : 3 playable characters (but once you have the third one, you have to stick with him because he has an extra dash and it's by far the best thing in the game), the multiplayer FPS is a good idea, if you find the good upgrades the game becomes funny until you get take a one shot

57,Gunfire Reborn,75320600,english,"It's great to see an Indie game get traction, especially a coop roguelite, however this game is lacking diversity for me. 
- Gameplay loop is not satisfying for me, making it feel very repetitive
- Early-metagame complexity is disappointing for beginners
- Combat mechanics are only okay (not a big problem if level design is good)
- Classes do not offer enough differentiation
- Classes are locked too far behind a wall of GRIND (not skill or rng)
- Movement is bland and unexciting
- Lack of innately creative tools for players to express their playstyles (other than through RNG drops)
- Randomized level design is repetitive

The biggest problem I find is lack of available differentiation between player playstyles for a beginner like me. I do not want to grind 5 - 10 hours just to hope to unlock another class, which at first glance doesn't seem that much different from the starter class anyway.

Another big issue is the lack of tools that can accentuate a player's creativity or personality in their playstyle. Deep Rock Galactic does this excellently as all its classes have truly unique and impactful/gamechanging movement tools that can be used in any number of ways. Risk of Rain 2 is another game I've been playing that has really great tools that encourage player creativity and inspires a feeling of freedom.

Then this game is probably for you! While the game doesn't have much content right now in terms of levels, it makes it up a lot through replayability! With a ton of weapons you can play around with and unlock, 3 characters who can find their playstyle and perks varying from run to run via unique upgrades each one can get via golden goblets. Various scrolls to further add to your abilities, and a somewhat addicting permanent upgrade tree between runs.

What Gunfire reborn does is simple, yet effective. Throwing you into linear levels, and giving you a hoard of enemies to shoot your way through.

That being said, there are some things you should be aware of. 

This is a ROGUE LIKE, ya know, like games such as Binding of Isaac, Risk of Rain, or Gungeon. That means if you die, you go straight back to the very start. You have been warned people who aren't already invested in the genre.

The other thing about this game you must be wary of, is the rather steep learning curve at the start. Not helped by how the skill tree limits your power early on, meaning death can come really swiftly, and unexpectedly to those who aren't at their A game, especially at the very first boss who has an attack pattern that can be easily dodged, but is brutally punishing to those who haven't got a hang of it yet.

Pros:
-Fluid combat.
-Well worth the money spent based on potential playtime
-Good progression system in terms of skills/unlockables
-Challenging.
-Multiplayer works flawlessly
-Very few bugs/glitches
-Devs add new content and updates regularly.
-Nearly endless ways to build your character and loadout each time.

Cons:
-Obviously, being the same 3 stages, things get repetitive occasionally.
-At this point, I wish there was a bit more content
-RNG based, heavily, when it comes to drops for anything

Overall, I think if you give gunfire the good o'l college try, and play through more than just a round or two, you will find it's enjoyable, and progressively challenging as you continue on. The three available characters are all quite unique, and have their own playstyles which freshens things up. I recommend it, mostly if you have 1-2 people you can play with.

50,Gunfire Reborn,75229553,english,"I'll start by admitting that there is something about these more random rogue type games that doesn't really click with me. Starting game after game going through the same starting levels hoping that maybe, just maybe... THIS time the right items will drop and I can progress slightly further than last time is a bit too much like sitting for hours in front of a slot machine, albeit a bit more interactive (but without the free booze). Making run after run through the same bland levels doing your best ATF impression as you shoot all manner of gun-wielding dogs and other critters is fun at first, but by your fourth or fifth slog through the same levels (no, randomly changing where the doors are doesn't inject new life into each run) only to find out that you're simply too ill-equipped to progress is just not fun. I could complain about difficulty spikes and some enemies with ridiculous homing ranged attacks, but I imagine these will be ironed out in later versions of the game.

The game has its charms: each run DOES give you a chance to give small permanent buffs to your character, and sometimes you can get some really wonky combos going. The quality is fantastic for an early-access game, as well. But when each pull on the handle of the slot machine robs you of 45 min to an hour of your life only for you to find out that you didn't get the three cherries this time, the little bits of fun here and there simply aren't a good return on your investment of time. And the time it takes to unlock the second and third characters means your runs are going to be very very similar to one another for quite some time.

I'll revisit this game and likely play it after a few updates, and perhaps I'll end up changing my review. As things stand, the game falls just short of a recommendation.

This game has serious potential. It's one of my favorite games to play at this time. Think Borderlands meets The Binding of Isaac and you have Gunfire Reborn. The gunplay is very fun, there is some strategy involved in becoming powerful, every run is slightly different, and each Hero has a different playstyle that is worth playing no matter your progress in the game. 

The only thing the game lacks is good English translation (this seems to be improving) and end-game content. You can likely max your level completely/unlock everything within 40 hours of gameplay. Which is a solid amount of time but it can start to lose replay value once you're maxed out. We need more reason to play outside of the game being fun and a good time passer, some kind of progression for late game content could give reason to dump a thousand of hours into this game. It has that much potential and I really want to see it get to that point.

TL;DR; Good gunplay (not amazing), cool weapons (didn't get that far to unlock more of them, and I won't. At least for a while). Clunky, forgettable maps/rooms. Graphics overall are ok, not great, even though it's cartoony. Hard to read text? (I don't have issues on any other games). Has potential, will wait for more updates before I jump in again.

As far as I have played and am concerned:

- The good -

- Cool Character(s)
- Some cool weapons
- A lot of different passive buffs

- The bad -

- Dash is way too short
- Maps/rooms are way too small/cramped (to my liking)
- Enemies attacks that track you (they curve as hell)
- Enemies with huge AOEs
- Lots of enemies on some areas
- All of the above combined
- Platforming sections (they're optional though)
- Initial character grunts are way too annoying, had to turn off the voice volume

24,Gunfire Reborn,75135212,english,"Early Access Roguelite FPS for 1-4 players, P2P-based!

Pros/Features:
- Devs read the forums and update regularly!
- 38 different weapons. Feel very different too - some have special abilities or passives (e.g. you can use one of the weapons to shoot, or to throw it to make a large explosion)
- Leveling system to give you better starting stats or unlock playable characters. You level up when you lose a run, more if you got further (remember, it's a Roguelite)
- 100+ different upgrades you can get during a run. Those can improve damage, status effects, defense, movement etc.
- Currently 3 playable characters with very different strengths, like favoring elemental, explosive or close range weapons
- weapons appear with 1-6 random upgrades depending on how far you are in the run. These can be anything from ""+Fire Rate"" to ""Only 2 shots in magazine but the second does x3 damage"" to ""create a hovering lightning ball whenever you headshot""
- All enemy shots can be dodged by ""dashing"", enemies do NOT have hitscan

Cons/Still needs work, it's EA:
- Three difficulty modes, but they're mostly about ++HP and ++Dmg
- Don't have a native English translator, so the descriptions of upgrades can sound weird (but 95% of them are still correct)
- Since no enemies are hitscan, they get to deal a lot of damage in return - if you don't move a lot and dodge regularly, you'll die early. It's a roguelite, expect to die often before you get better
- Weapons and Upgrades balance, I rate it about 5/10. A few weapons are very reliable, a few weapons are very unreliable. Some upgrades barely do anything, some upgrades can carry you

TL;DR It's VERY cheap for its quality, I totally recommend it :)

33,Gunfire Reborn,75125999,english,"Quite a fun game, if not slightly repetitive.  If you like Risk of Rain 2 but wanted some progression with leveling up your characters between runs, this is probably the game for you.

There's room for improvement.  As this is a foreign-made game, a lot of the English translations are off and it can be difficult to tell exactly what a weapon modifier is supposed to actually be doing.  They're not terribly off though, and can usually be figured out.  Some of the modifiers are somewhat boring +damage/+crit damage etc instead of making the weapons more unique to use.  There are modifiers like that to make the weapons more interesting, but in my playthroughs those have been rare.  More variety there would be better.  The levels are pseudo-randomized, with different paths to take open to you each run, but they do all feel the same quite quickly the more you play.  Lastly, once you fully level up your character (which I haven't gotten close to yet, that will probably take ~80ish hours maybe?), I'm not sure what else there would be to do in this game.  So it does have an end (unless they add some sort of endgame for maxed characters), but it will take a long time for you to get there.

It's a good concept, it's pretty -- but it's also a slog that doesn't do anything to entertain. It needs a serious rebalance.

1. The hero is SLOW. He moves at a leisurely stroll that barely enables you to avoid enemy projectiles -- and nothing more. There is no run in the game, only an instant, short range dash on recharge. 
2. The ""Time to kill"" is far, far too long. It takes two headshots -- about 15 seconds in total -- to kill the basic mook, with even the second-least-threatening mook taking 30+ seconds. 
3. The weapons are either slow to fire (and don't deal much damage) or spray bullets that deal no damage at all. Even the ""rocket launcher"" equivalent can't kill a basic mook in one hit!
4. The game's difficulty curve is all over the place. Some areas are insultingly easy, some areas are clearly designed for a large party and clearly had never been scaled down.
5. You can self-revive once. It's usually a bad deal, since the enemies will gather up to mob you the instant you revive. Since the game does not offer things like temporary invulnerability or pushback on revive, they *will* bring you back down in seconds.
6. There is no way to alter starting gear, so you are forever stuck with one slow firing weak gun. Its only saving grace is that it's fairly accurate and useful for breaking the pots scattered through the level.
7. The ""powerups"" in this game fall exclusively into ""why would I care"" or ""totally overpowered"" categories, with essentially no in-between. Probably my favourite worst example is ""burning enthusiast"" which grants life-steal on burning enemies... except I've yet to see a weapon capable of setting enemies on fire.
8. Upgrading your weapons doesn't make any sense. You are likely to find a better gun very soon. 
9. There's only one weapon worth holding on to, a plasma rifle like ""lightning gun"". 
10. Health pickups are extremely rare in the game and usually show up when you don't need them anyway.

And finally:
The game gets extremely same-y very, very quickly. I know what the level is themed, but some more variety beyond ""more blue walls"" or ""less blue walls"" would be welcome.",1598723934,1598723934,FALSE,1,1,0.421282291,2,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,318,7,279,0,279,1598721516,,

43,Gunfire Reborn,75117756,english,"It's fun. Not a big community, some nights you just cant' find a team to play with. Game is pretty radically imbalanced, especially for groups enemies scale at an incredible rate, bosses are even worse. Still if you find a group with some 100+ level players, you tend to make it through ok. But a full group of level 20's can't handle the first boss without some luck. While the game kinda of has random weapon drops there appear to only be roughly 15 or 20 weapons available in the game in total and a handful of them are useless, so you're pretty much always looking for the same 5 or 6 guns and if you don't find them you know you won't win right off. Enhancements are critical, even if you get one of those previously mentioned guns, if they don't have great flavor text to enhance them further, same thing, you know you're only gonna make it so far. There are semi ""hidden"" levels within the primary levels called vaults, which you basically have to do to keep up with the scaling at all. They're mostly fun, but there are a couple which are infuriatingly difficult. Beyond that there are only maybe 4 or 6 of them and the game just randomly switches between which ones appear. Overall the game is fun, especially in a group. However it lacks content on a intense level. It needs a lot more guns and more ""vaults"" to vary the experience and it needs to focus more on the amount of enemies you're fighting over how long you're fighting them. in some instances a single enemy can take 30~40 seconds to put down because they're just damage sponges.",1598717350,1598717350,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,458,155,459,0,356,1599855574,,

Despite still being in early access, it's quite complete, with the main quest consisting of 3 worlds with 6 stages in each world.

The levels are randomly generated, you will find many weapons and scrolls (good or bad, which you can choose to take or not) that will make each run different and enjoyable. There are also 2 merchants selling upgrades in-game. When the game ends (win or lose) you earn some points which you can use to upgrade your talents to make your character permanently stronger. Currently there are 3 characters to choose from, although you start with cat and will need to hit talent level 30 and 40 to unlock the other 2. The game can be played as single-player or multiplayer with up to 3 other friends or randoms. Matchmaking is simple and fast, and I find myself enjoying my first win in a team of 3.

Some recommendations: 

Secondary skills don't scale well at all, grenades do less than 1% of a mobs health in higher difficulties in the final stages. With them being so lackluster, ascensions for secondaries are pointless and sad to see or get forced to take. Consider improving scaling or adding more utility to the abilities. 

Elemental damage is too scalable. This forces a lack of diversity in builds and weapon choices, and only encourages playing the cat. You can get the laser gloves ticking for 22k damage every .2 seconds with infinite magazines by the end  of act 3 on elite. No other build or class can even do 1/3rd the damage the cat can do. Consider buffing explosive/normal damage, or buffing the dog/bird in other ways, such as the hero talents or improving ascensions.

•	There are plenty of weapons that you can obtain and each weapon has something unique that puts it apart from all the other weapons. Weapons are randomly dropped as loot and by completing challenges it is possible to obtain new weapons for the first time.

73,Gunfire Reborn,75000526,english,"Just to clarify, this isn't a review on actual gameplay, there are many other great reviews here commenting about the different mechanics and experience of the game. This is more to defend the game from the negative feedback.

For an early access game that was released in May, it shows its potential of how great of a game this will become. Reading the reviews, I was happy that many people shared the same point of view that I had. Yet I still come across these negative reviews saying it got boring fast and doesn't have much to offer. Keep in mind this game is early access for a reason. I went through the updates and change logs and saw how much they added in only a few months, and I am sure there is so much yet to come.

If you're looking for a game that you can grind for days and never get bored of, yes, this isn't it, YET. But, I say again, it's early access for a reason. For 9 euro, you're investing in a game that will grow to become better than some triple A games I've played recently.

When the game is tagged 'Roguelite,' pay attention.  The tag means that this game is artificially difficult and gives you almost no health buffs to compensate for the mobs of annoyingly powerful adds often with shields that lob bombs at you.  

Also, having picked up multiple weapons and mods, you DON'T KEEP ANY of them in your inventory when you leave the level.  What you do keep is a small bump in a simple skill tree.  You start every mission with no mods and a single pea shooter.  You rely on RNG to get decent weapons, which doesn't always work.


I played for 45 minutes, got through one level and the side missions, got killed by the boss ( no health drops or second wind, btw, and the boss had huge health and shield pools that recharged 5 times ).  So after all that, ii was able to level up one of five levels on a shield buff ( +5% ) in the simple skill tree.

97,Gunfire Reborn,74978798,english,"Gunfire Reborn is an interesting game that mixes FPS, rogue-lite, and a bit of RPG elements to create what I find is a pretty fun shooter experience. 

The first thing you'll probably notice are the aesthetics of the game. The characters and the environments use this low poly 3D style with a bit of Chinese influence thrown in. Some people might find this simple and maybe even a bit dull, but I personally think it works very well for this game. Because the graphics are so simple, it makes it pretty easy to see and know what is going on at the moment and as a plus, I also find it is quite easy to keep a high frame rate at all times during each run. Same thing can be said about the UI, being simple, but also giving you information you need without being obstructive. I think there should be some options to change or remove stuff such as the damage numbers, but it gets the job done.

I'll briefly go over the other aspects of the game here as they don't play nearly as big a factor as the gameplay. 
Story is... basically nonexistent. You'll get some brief dialogue when you first start the game and when you first complete a run, but that's about it. Next, the music in the game is good, but somewhat limited. There's the main menu theme, music for each stage, and music for each boss. One thing I found neat is how the stage music is mostly atmospheric at first, but when you get into battle with enemies, it ramps up into something more energetic and fitting for battle until it's over. Lastly, I found the sound design to be pretty great. The weapons sounding exactly how you would imagine them to, the feedback when you land a critical hit on an enemy, and the different sounds that each enemy makes adds a lot to the enjoyment of the game.

Finally we get to the gameplay, which has a lot to go over. Seeing how this is an FPS game, the weapons are pretty important and thankfully they do not disappoint. There are a total of 38 different weapons to use as of right now and they range from the humble assault rifle to more absurd things like a fire breathing dragon or laser gloves that make you feel like you're playing as Iron Man. All the weapon archetypes you would expect such as snipers, shotguns, and rocket launchers, to name a few are here so finding something you end up loving to use is pretty likely. There's a critical hit system for hitting enemies in their weak points and a lucky shot system that gives you a percentage based chance to deal bonus damage to an enemy depending on how high your chance is.

Elements are also in the game and there are three different ones that can apply status effects. Fire which deals extra damage against flesh and can deal damage over time, Lightning which does extra damage against shields and can cause that enemy to take extra damage from everything, and Corrosion which does extra damage against armor and slows enemies down drastically. It is also possible to fuse these status effects together to cause an extremely powerful effect depending on what combination is fused.

There are three different characters you can play as as of this review and they all play differently from each other. You have the cat which uses an orb that's capable of stopping enemies in place for several seconds and corrosive grenades, then there is the dog who can dual wield weapons and use explosive grenades, and finally the bird who has a leaping attack that can restore his armor and a cleave attack in the place of grenades that can hit enemies all around him. All of these characters share a universal dash ability that can be used for dodging or just getting around a bit more quickly. This may make them seem a bit underwhelming, but that is where the ascensions and scrolls systems come into play.

Ascensions are obtained at the end of each level through goblets and they give you the choice of upgrading one of three randomly chosen ascensions. The majority of ascensions in the game give some powerful boosts for doing specific things or power up your characters unique moves. Each character gets their own unique ascensions that allow you to fine tune them to a specific play style. You can obtain the same ascension up to three times in a run to power up their effects, with the third level  being much more powerful than the previous ones. If that doesn't sound good enough for you, there are also scrolls to further power yourself up. Scrolls are items you can randomly obtain in vaults or purchased from a merchant if one is in their inventory. They're typically a lot more specific in their usage than the ascensions, but because of the sheer number of different scrolls there are (there are 100+ you can find), you are bound to find just the right scrolls you need to end up having a run where you just melt everything.

There is something important I should go over that may be a bit controversial, and that is the talents system. Talents are permanent upgrades that you unlock at the end of a run, whether you die or make it to the end. You purchase these upgrades with soul essence that you earn by killing enemies. For the most part these upgrades let you access things that you couldn't before like the vaults or the weapon chest at the start of a run or boosting the amount of soul essence and copper (which is used to buy stuff from merchant and upgrade the level of your weapons) you can earn in a run. Permanent upgrades are nothing new in these rogue-lite style games, but the thing I have a problem with is just how much easier the game gets when you unlock a bunch of these.

When I first started playing the game, it was pretty challenging. You start out with only the cat and a vast number of the weapons and scrolls need to be unlocked by doing certain things before they'll stop dropping in runs. I had to be constantly on my toes against even the weakest enemies as a couple of hits from anything would spell the end of a run. As I kept playing and learning the patterns of the enemies, I unlocked a fair amount of stuff that made the runs significantly easier. This resulted in a snowball effect where because I knew what to expect and the power gained from my talents and new items, the game became so much easier than the start. It got to the point where I was winning much more than I lost even on the harder difficulty.

Even though it's super fun to destroy everything, it gets very boring if I'm able to do that consistently each run. I think this game could benefit from a more challenging difficulty and changing some of the stuff on the talent tree that just raise your stats. Getting stuff like taking 15% less damage from enemies or dealing 25% more damage to enemies, while effective, are just boring in a game like this that rewards you for smart builds and contribute to the lack of challenge that higher level players experience.

Despite these issues, this game is still a blast to play whether you play it solo or in coop. This has been one of my favorite FPS games to play this year and with the attention to feedback that the developers are giving to the community, it can only go up from here. If you get annoyed at having to play the same parts to learn how to combat each enemy or the talents system bothers you, this probably isn't the game for you. For everyone else, I can't recommend it enough. It's so refreshing to play an early access game this year that isn't a cash grab or just a bare-bones proof of concept that doesn't go anywhere. At only 12 USD, I've got more hours out of this game than the vast majority of triple AAA titles I've played and I still want to keep putting hours into this game.",1598489476,1598489476,TRUE,2,0,0.544235885,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,393,28,4736,0,3648,1599369581,,

Some bothersome things that could afford to change like the boulders in the vault that are almost impossible to avoid. Some boss moves are also hard to avoid. The fact that someone needs to be revived could afford to be more in your face because some people just leave you there when they have many clear chances to get you up and you just watch everyone or just leave. Controller support is terrible. Sensitivity is so high you'll spin your head off and is too sensitive to adjust the sensitivity. Not too concerned because keyboard and mouse feel fine. 

One thing that pisses me off is getting pretty far, having a lot of soul essence, and then everyone dies and you lose it all. That's bogus. C'mon now.

The gameplay is amazing, there is a variety of weapons that cannot be neatly categorized into ""good"" or ""bad"" based on their normal stats as there are a variety of affixes assigned to each weapon that you find which encourage you to think about what you're picking up and why, rewarding the player for taking time to experiment and get familiar with the game. Metagame aside, the weapons themselves feel great and reward the player for building skill with critical strikes that occur from hitting weak points. The game is very well suited for multiplayer due to having instanced loot (players receive their own loot that only they can see until it is picked up) however the player has the option to drop and trade their loot with others should they choose to which makes multiplayer sometimes more rewarding than singleplayer.

The game has very unified art design and each stage feels different due to a combination of the art as well as different enemies and challenges.

Overall I'm very satisfied with this game and can't wait for its full release.

Some comments though (only representing my own view):
1. Could we add a ""back to the lobby"" button while in the home screen? Right now, if I am already in a group and wanted to check my hero and all other stuff, I can't go back to the lobby if I am in the home screen. This results in opening a new group if I am playing with friends and I feel the extra procedure is unnecessary.
2. Maybe a melee system would be nice? Sometimes when the enemy is only one blood away and I have to change my magazine, I feel it can be easily killed with a melee.

51,Gunfire Reborn,74917879,english,"I haven't gotten very far into [i]Gunfire Reborn[/i], but so far I really don't see what the hype is about. With so many other great games available, I feel no desire to invest more time into this one when I'm just not enjoying it, so I'll be requesting a refund. There are a few major issues that kept me from enjoying the game:

[list]
[*] I don't like the way the game is balanced. The enemy AI is terrible and their aim is pretty bad too, so normal encounters only become challenging when there are overwhelming numbers present. But then I get to the first boss and the cooldown on my movement ability is just too long to avoid his attacks. I tried hiding behind the pillars, but he just charges me and I'm too slow to get away. Maybe there's some trick I'm missing, or maybe the game is intended to be played multiplayer so that you can switch off kiting duties, but as it is I feel like I'm only ever being hit because the boss can attack faster than my dash cooldown. That does not feel fair or fun to play.
[*] On the subject of movement, the game just feels really slow. I wish it was faster paced, like [i]Doom Eternal[/i], which was one of my favorite games of 2020. That might make the game too easy in its current state, but they could counterbalance it by making the enemies stronger and smarter. I'd also like it if the corridors and rooms were larger and had more verticality to allow for more dynamic gameplay.
[*] I like the low-poly art style, but the environments feel visually flat with narrow color palettes and limited shading. The game is just boring to look at.
[*] The character voices are really annoying, though they can be turned off in the audio menu.

You can also avoid some attacks by standing behind the pillars. Hope these tips can help you defeat the BOSS. Because of the background story, the first map is relatively narrow, but the second and third map will give you different experience. Thanks for your feedback."
52,Gunfire Reborn,74916964,english,"For starters the game as a whole is great, it seems like it is 80% finished already - Completely playable tons of Buffs/passives, plenty of weapons; Each with tons of modifiers, 3 Characters, 3 Stages, 3 Bosses (Which aren't just pushovers and take a bit to learn without external input), An interesting elemental mechanic making combining effects more powerful which ends up leading to pretty neat synergy solo and much easier power in multiplayer, Rouge lite elements that are pretty rewarding but feel somewhat pure power creep instead of interesting mechanics (Specifically the talent tree giving things like Weapon damage/CDR/Damage/Health/Damage reduction)
The design and game feel are great, but seems there are more things that have had more attention than others.

(More of a feedback section)
the gunplay, feedback, designs are all amazing. But things like movement - skill usage - feedback for damage (from enemies) can feel quite clunky and frustrating at times.
specifically enemies targeting you behind cover and charging what would normally be easy to dodge; high damaging attacks, Suddenly become un-dodgable with no noise or indication. Very easy to work around once you're familiar with that being possible but could prove to be frustrating early on.
Movement while nothing is inherently wrong with it, it ends up feeling extremely bland at times - The addition of the bird character's ability being a leap makes the game far more enjoyable. I personally would love the movement to be explored more beyond set speed walking, set distance dashing and set height jumping, but it would present a lot of balance issues i would imagine. (Since most enemies attack with projectile like attacks or melee).
Skill usage is one of the things that annoyed me very early on and would be something that would be amazing for game feel. Right off the bat the first character has a Gas grenade and a Ranged AOE stun, Super powerful to be able to set up the nade and stun a group of enemies into it right? The issue is both the stun and the nade have a set animation and a set time, at the end of each there's a small delay where you're unable to act on anything not even shoot your weapon as you rearm it, The game feels like it presents itself as a fast action packed fps but being locked into that huge downtime feels horrible to me. Make it possible to cancel the animation of pulling up the weapon after using a skill - with another skill.
Feedback for damage is a tough one, There is feedback in the sense of, a radar, Enemies make noise when firing - 'Most' of the enemies having a distinct noise associated with them when attacking or nearby, you get a sound when you are hit, screen flashing. All are great but i feel like there could be something more done (This could entirely be a me thing as i have no real suggestions on how to improve it, but better said than not).

Bit of a long one but i really hope they don't just hault development after 1.0 as this game has tons of potential in additional design.",1598403320,1598403320,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,586,13,9983,0,1844,1600364251,,

- Low poly/Easy on the eyes graphics
- Feedback feature built into the game
- Reactive game updates
- Consistent base game mechanics
- There is enough content to build synergies 
- Fun overall game loop.


-- Negatives

- Needs more content
- There are no secrets in stages
- The challenges in stages are non-optional and sometimes don't provide an additional reward upon completion (also there isn't enough variety in challenges.)
- There's no fast travel between rooms during stages
- Difficulty scaling uses solo stats as base, but as soon as your players in the squad are more than 1 it scaled to 4x (times) the base instead of 1x (+1x for each additional player in the squad.)

!!(These positives and negatives are subject to change over time and with the regular game updates)!!

There are bugs, and I can't speak for every players of this game, but I have not encounter any game breaking bugs. But if there is, there's a feedback option in the game to report it to the developers.

It will take some hours of grinding before you can finish the second level, and I am not sure how long to even finished the third one.

Also, playing multiplayer is a double edge sword, since with 4 players in co-op mode makes the enemies very spongy. You need to  have very good teammates. If one or two are just messing around, you wont get pass the first boss.

79,Gunfire Reborn,74819379,english,"While this game is in early access, it does still have a pretty decent amount of content and unlockables to sink your teeth into.  This game is far from perfect, but is still a good time.

The good:

- This game takes an approach similar to borderlands with its guns.  Very unique, fun, and have random stats so even if you have a duplicate, it will still play a bit differently.

- The characters each have fun abilities and upgrades that change the way you play.  While they have the same speed and jump height, the key to each character are the upgrades you can obtain during a run and creating a build off of them.

- When you unlock something like a weapon or scroll, you get it immediately as a drop in that run so you get to try it right away.  From that run onwards its added to the loot pool.  Love this idea.

- At first I wasn't a fan of the visuals, but over time as I got to see more of the enviroments it really grew on me.  I don't think the first stage does it justice, because everything after the first stage looks incredible.

- very challenging.  If you stand in place for a few seconds, you're dead.  This makes learning enemy and boss' weaknesses and exploiting them even more satisfying.

The Bad:

- The in-between run progression system is, in my opinion, very frustrating.  You gain soul energy by playing the game, and at the end of your run, you can use them at the talent tree to give yourself permanent upgrades.  By itself I think it's cool, but each talent point you get gives you a level.  You unlock very important things, like both of the unlockable characters through your talent level.  Where this bothers me is the fact that a talent point gives you ONE level, no matter how much it actually costed.  So if you want to unlock stuff, you have to prioritize the cheapest upgrades over the good ones.  The soul energy also disappears after a run so you HAVE to spend them, unless you get an upgrade that lets you keep them.  

- The pacing of the gameplay feels way too slow.  There aren't many ways to consistently increase your movement speed.  There are scrolls that will do it but you can't stack them so you have to find many different scrolls that do similar things.  The gameplay feels more like overwatch than a highly mobile shooter.  You have a dash, sure, but it's on a cooldown each time you use it, and doesn't go very far. There's also virtually no verticality to any map, and no movement-based scrolls.  Like why doesn't the bird character have a double jump? Or a glide?  He has wings.  Every character feels like a tank.

- No stacking of items, to make their affects more powerful.  After playing Risk of Rain 2, and seeing how its item system works, I genuinely believe every roguelike in existence should take notes from it.  Stacking of items and getting duplicates makes for way more customizable builds, and allows for people to play the way they like.  

- Doesn't start actually getting fun until you've done a few runs and have more stuff unlocked and have more talent points spent.

- Multiplayer feels harder than singleplayer.  The difficulty scaling is too high.  If you're playing with a 4 player team, every enemy, even the weak ones feel like bullet sponges.  More health isn't the answer to having more players, again, take notes from Risk of Rain 2.  

Overall:  It's a good game, but it's severely outclassed by other games in the genre.  Namely Risk of Rain 2.  But the game is still good on its own and has a lot of potential.  It's in early access so it can't be judged too harshly as of now.  If you're a roguelike enthusiast like myself, this is a game you should play.  But if you don't play these kinds of games usually, this isn't the one to start with.

Even before the addition of the third character and beating the game countless times, every single run you would do would have a different feel and you'd tackle it with a different strategy.

Maybe you'll get your favourite weapon, but is it going to have the powerups you need to win or will you have to change at the last minute?

26,Gunfire Reborn,74783065,english,"This might have the EA tag but tbh it feels more complete than most games and it just keeps adding content.

It is exactly what ot looks like, a first person rogue-lite shooter with currently 3 different characters.
All characters have a different play style, defined by the skills and upgrades you get during a run. Also depending on the other items you get there is also quite some diversity in builds. Every run you have to adapt and try to make the most out of the things you get and it is rare that you really feel unlucky and under powered.

The runs itself are perfectly in length imo, You have nice power progression over the course of the run and a complete run will take you around 40min. So it is a really nice game to pick up and play for 1-2h and come back later.

Upgrades you can buy after a run (with currency acquired during a run) feel good and really add up making you feel way more powerful. The normal upgrades are quite general, like more HP, more damage and so on. Every character also has character specific upgrades, which directly improve certain aspects of the character.

It took me 45 hours to get all upgrades but I still have to get all the unlockable items. Around 70% of my runs were singe player, which is totally fine and might be even a bit easier than multiplayer. But multiplayer is a lot more fun. The nice thing is all drops are individual so no competition for loot. The game has automatic matchmaking if you want to play with random people or you can invite your friends. I mostly played with randoms and the community so far was always nice and helpful.

One really important thin in a shooter are ofc the weapons and this game has a lot of them. Most weapons are unqiue and there are only a few weapons which feel the same. Adding to the weapon variety are a huge pool of possible weapon mods. Which modify the weapons heavily They can change the elem tn of the weapon, give you bonus damage, bonus crit and so on, or might even add some unique effects, sometimes unique to the weapon.

All in all this game is perfect in what it does. The difficulty is nice and it never feels unfair.

Also the grind is a bit harsh atm, the reward doesn't scale well with the skill tree requirements. Polish and balance this, keep adding content and add random dungeons. Then it will deserve the reviews it got so far. Right now i have fun, and i see potential, it's still far from where it could be so i hope the devs know that and give us what we want.

[h1]Full Review[/h1]

Just like many roguelites, every run in Gunfire Reborn is different. Each time you play, different guns, ascensions and scrolls present themselves. Scrolls have varying abilities that can aid a build or work together well with a specific weapon or ability. Many of them can be found but they can also be bought at the Peddler or traded for via treasure chests.

You don’t have control over what ascensions (character upgrades during a run) you find, but each time you find a goblet containing one, you get a choice in 3, of which most you can upgrade two more times after taking. 

There are a lot of unique guns to choose from (currently 40 different base guns), with a lot of them having a unique function or ability. On top of that, they can all have different statistics and properties to them, such as increased projectiles, magazine or reload speed, a different element or a gun-specific upgrade. This variation allows a lot of guns to be used in many different ways and for many different builds.

You can also upgrade your guns at the Craftsman. He can make your weapon stronger and also reforge any possible Gemini inscriptions. The latter are an inscription that if both your guns have it, they become active and work on both your guns, such as a shared amount of crit damage, or shared magazine, shared damage type (element fusion), etc.

There’s currently 3 different characters, all with unique abilities, ascension paths and playstyles:

* Crown Prince who can shoot an orb that locks enemies in place and has weakening smoke grenades
* Ao Bai who can dual-wield guns that combines and amplifies their strength and has explosive grenades 
* Qing Yan who is a martial arts character that attacks by using leaps to land on enemies and then cleave them with his wings

There are currently 3 zones: Longling Tomb, Anxi-Desert and Duo-Fjords. Each have unique enemies, elite minibosses and a final boss. They also contain vaults, which are a single area that contain a reward, but to obtain it you first have to survive a challenge, such as a trap parkour or fighting off more enemies.

You can play with up to four players in a single game. Playing with more players makes the enemies stronger but it also allows you to trade scrolls and weapons with your teammates so that everyone can more easily go for the build they are trying to get.

[h1]TL;DR[/h1]

In a nutshell, this game is Borderlands mixed with Binding of Isaac in Sea of Thieves graphics. It has great replay value because of the different inscriptions guns can spawn with, as well as the different scrolls and ascensions you get each time.

This game is in early access and while it is a fully-fledged game, it is still worked on when it comes to squashing bugs and adding more content. The devs (only 3!) have shown incredibly potential for this game to become even better and are working hard to add more and more to it. It’s very addicting and can make you really forget the time. And all that for the ridiculously low price of only 10 bucks, outside of sales. Better get this awesome game before it may have a price increase in the future, because for the amount of content you get, this is a true bargain.

85,Gunfire Reborn,74741294,english,"At first, I was very skeptical of Gunfire Reborn. It's a Chinese-made game offered at a very low price point - which is usually synonymous with massive amounts of microtransactions. There's no MTX to be found in this game.. at least not yet, and I'm hoping it stays that way because this is actually a good game. 

At first, this game looked like a mix of Binding of Isaac and Borderlands.. and that's more or less exactly what it is - it's Borderlands in roguelike form. Usually this would be something I'd drop right away, but the game is strangely well-designed with only a couple of flaws: notably the multiplayer is scaled a little strangely and there's some bugs involving enemies spawning on top of you that can lead to deaths that are very hard to prevent.

Gunfire Reborn starts you off with an item pool that has a couple of guns and some skill scrolls in it: scrolls are usually a tradeoff of one stat for another. The basic guns are all kind of bad, though once you unlock better ones (which you do pretty much immediately) you start noticing that the bad guns don't show up nearly as often. Part of the problem is that this game follows Borderlands's design principles of elemental guns that work against different types of HP: enemies can have shields that resist fire and acid but are weak to lightning or armor that's weak to acid but strong against fire and lightning. Non-elemental guns (the majority of what you start with) are kind of meh all around.

That's one thing I wish the developers would improve on. Past the first few stages, you more or less need an elemental gun or two: usually one that does electric and one that does acid. There's not much of a reason to carry anything else unless you're doing multiplayer, in which case fire is also acceptable provided someone else has lightning and acid. There's.. I think one scroll that makes non-elemental guns kind of okay, but it's hard to find and isn't worth hanging onto bad guns for. I feel like there should be some reason to use those and make every item in the pool useful in some way rather than having a bunch of items no one is going to pick up unless they have no better options.

My only other complaint is that the multiplayer is balanced very strangely. Not only does enemy HP scale, but their damage also scales to the point where getting oneshotted isn't all that rare of an occurrence. This becomes particularly egregious in the second stage where you have rapidfire teleporting sniper enemies who can put out ridiculous amounts of damage in MP. In Singleplayer, it's not as bad, but enemy HP scales really fast and can turn some enemies into bullet sponges even if you're using the right damage type and landing headshots. 

There's also a particularly annoying bug where some rooms feature waves of enemies, and on occasion they can spawn right on top of you and either kill you or do lots of damage before you can move. I feel like this is probably an easy fix of either changing the spawn logic so enemies have to spawn X distance away from players or making hidden areas where enemies can spawn that isn't right on top of you.

Other than that though, this is a pretty fun game and worth the pickup at current price, provided the developers do not try to implement MTX.

86,Gunfire Reborn,71893757,english,"Initially I suggested waiting to buy this game. After taking a break from this I came back to play it after the devs had released a few updates.

While I still don't think this game is complete, I can say that you will still get your money's worth.

The Good:

Guns: Guns still feel amazing to use. In fact they actually feel better since I first played. They're satisfying and always fun to experiment with.

Combat: There's always a lot going on. You really need to be aware of your surroundings and kill quickly. Previously I had an issue with needing to hide too much. While that still happens on occasion you'll be engaged in high pace action most of the time.

Bosses: Bosses don't seem to have changed much since I first played, but I was already fond of them as they were. Intense battles against unique and interesting enemies. What's not to love?

Characters: Something I didn't touch on before were the characters. With the addition of a third character I feel the need to talk about them. Each character is unique and plays a different way. They won't all stick with every person, but I'm sure you'll find at least one you like. While I would like to see more in the future I can easily live with the 3 the devs gave us.

Loot: Finding loot is always exciting. Whether it be a gun, a scroll or another upgrade point. The best part is that when playing in co-op, loot is client side. That means no loot ninjas, but you have the option to drop loot for teammates if you desire. So it's safe to say the loot system is very player friendly.

Perks: One of my biggest issues was that there didn't feel like there was enough control over what perks you got with each character during a run. This hasn't changed, but they did change the perks themselves to be better. Now it doesn't feel like you're getting screwed over when you don't get what you wanted.

The Bad:

Content: Pretty much my biggest issue right now is that there isn't enough content. You have 3 areas and each area has 1 boss at the end. You may get some secret areas with mini boss like enemies, but I don't really count those being they're always random. Being this is in early access I'm assuming this will change with time. I'd love to see more areas and if possible maybe some branching paths to keep runs unique.


Overall this game is a lot of fun and I now feel like I can say it's worth buying. It may not be done, but with how much progress the devs have made since my initial review of this game I have high hopes for it.",1593711597,1598122366,TRUE,0,0,0.514524758,1,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,103,8,4396,0,685,1600207415,,

My biggest problem comes from the lack of damage feedback from both the enemies and yourself. Most of them seem to be unflinching, so its not clear if you have landed a shot. This is mitigated by the damage numerics that float, but it is a visually jarring experience.

Gameplay:
 A great rougelite. Each run feels unique and straightforward with a great balance to the difficulty. Some runs my build is working, othertimes I need to completely change my loadouts and spending habits. Gunplay is satisfying. Exploration is limited, but the vaults add an extra layer of depth to the gameplay. You can use them to dip away from a particularly hard fight or get that one extra scroll that makes your build click. Throwing on my favorite podcast/music and blowing up some terracotta baddies feels great.

Suggestions:
 Progression feels good... most of the time. Sometimes I feel skunked when I have 49 Soul essence at the end of a run and my next minimum upgrade is at 50. Would love to see an ""Essence Bank"" that takes half of your unused essence at the end of the run and stores it, allowing you to use it at the end of your next run to avoid the exact same situation from happening again. 

 Would love to see a starting roster of 2/3 characters at the start, with a rounded out total of 5 or 6 to pick from. But even this is just for the freedom of choice. The default character feels well balanced and I appreciate that more than a bunch of cliche unbalanced characters thrown in for the sake of inclusion. 

This is a solid rougelite please play it if thats your jam.

56,Gunfire Reborn,70727628,english,"SUMMARY: A must-buy FPS Roguelike RPG loaded with plenty of features - optional multiplayer, plenty of rewards and unlockables, and it's own fun aesthetic.  There's tough enemies, interesting semi-randomized weapons, and a mix of in-run and carry-over skill advancement.  As you play you unlock even more, so each run is usually rewarding.  Though in Early Access, there's a lot there, and hopefully more to come, and its an absolute bargain at the price.


Note: This game is Early Access, and like most Early Access has its flaws.  In this case the game has a lot of content, but needs some polishing and fleshing out.

Calling Gunfire Reborn an ""FPS Roguelike"" is technically accurate, but doesn't quite cover just how much is in this game.  The standard stuff is there: shooting things, finding weapons and loot, carry-over character advancement.  But there's also different characters to play, synergies among weapons, temporary boosts, randomized weapon traits, and more.  It goes beyond its premise, so let's get to the game!

STORY: There's not much here, an evil corruption has hit the land of adorable animals armed with heavy mystic weaponry, etc.  I expect there's more story, but on the plus side you start out playing a cat with an awesome hat and alchemic-magic abilities, so that's a plus.  Later you also can play a badass dog who dual-wields weapons and throws bombs, or a Martial Artist Bird with kicks, sweeps, and unique defenses.

LEVELS: Levels are semi-randomized randomized, and you essentially enter an area, battle all enemies, and then the next area opens.  The game levels can range from duller early dungeons to fascinating outdoor areas.  Levels also contain various challenges and hidden vaults where you can uncover Occult Scrolls for bonuses.  Explore everything and find every advantage because you're going to face a lot of . . .

ENEMIES: Enemies are diverse and have decent AI, so they'll shred you if you're not careful. 
 After the first level, you also encounter some enemies with special traits.  They also have their own resistances and vulnerabilities, and that means you rely on . . ..

WEAPONS: The Weapons are wild, from lightning ball launchers to poison dart guns, to giant cannons with tiger faces.  Not only does each weapon function differently, they all have at least one randomized trait (called an inscription), and you can upgrade them.  The farther you go, the more inscriptions a weapon has.  You also can upgrade weapons and alter them.  You can only carry two at a time, and you also get a starter weapon that automatically levels up as you find better equipment.  Choose them carefully as they also work with . . .

SCROLLS AND ASCENTIONS: Each level you can get temporary enhancements for that run called Ascentions.  Scrolls can be found or bought and they add in-run bonuses, but sometimes disadvantages.  Ascentions are are purely positive and follow character-specific skill trees, but you get random choices.  These can have VERY powerful synergies with each other and weapons, so choose wisely.  Of course some things carry over from game to game . . .

PERMANENT BONUSES: As you play (and die) you'll collect ""soul essence"".  This allows you to get permanent character boosts that carry over between runs.  You'll want to select these carefully and plan accordingly.   Also as you complete tasks like defeating so many enemies or reaching a milestone, more weapons and scrolls unlock and enter the pool of possible equipment.  Playing each time usually has some reward, which affect . . ..

CHARACTERS:  You start with one character, the aforementioned Awesome Cat and can unlock others like the Explosion Dog and Melee Bird.  They also function differently - each has a unique ability and a unique grenade attack.  So there's more ways to play - and ways to team up!  Finally, I'd be remiss if I didnt mention . . .

THE LOOK: Though some levels are dull looking the designs for the heroes and monsters is great.  The heroes (and indeed their allies) have real character - reminicent of designs in Kung Fu Panda..  Early enemies resemble the famous Terracotta Warriors of Qin Shi Huang which is just neat.  Later enemies have different aesthetics of animal-soldiers  Enemies in motion have character.  There's a lot of detail here.

CHALLENGE: The game is challenging, and you'l probably have to grind a few levels before you get far.  The challenge does have some erratic difficulty as the randomized elements can mean one run you're overwhelmed, another you get through it easy.  Careful planning can usually but not always account for being overwhelmed..  One very important note - this is a thoughtful FPS.  Running around without thinking will get you killed!  Instead you want to get into the . . .

GAMEPLAY LOOP: Gunfire Reborn takes a few runs to get into, then the loop kicks in.  Unlocking the Talent tree gives you bonuses and new equipment.  These help you get farther, earning more resources to level up, and finding equipment and Ascentions to possibly prolong your run.  Earlier levels become easier and easier, so you can blaze through them.  The game's tight play and design makes each run fun, relatively short, and rewarding.  Also if you beat the game the first time you get . . .

ELITE MODE:  But it's not over!  Win the game and there's an Elite mode so you can do it all over again with tougher enemies and more rewards!  Elite mode sort of ""turns everything up to eleven"" - more traps, more dangerous enemies, better loot.

Oh and after that?  NIGHTMARE MODE.


DOWNSIDES: There's only a few downsides, and most are really because this is Early Access.
- The earliest of three levels is dull design-wise.  They get more interesting as they go on.
- Erratic difficulty.  The game's difficulty curve is unpredictable depending on the level, enemies, layout, and if you're facing a boss or not.  You can usually compensate, but there are sudden moments of ease or challenge that can surprise you.
- Runthrough approach.  You can't leap ahead in runs - every time you start over in the first dungeon, though you can save your run between the three areas.  This is not a problem, more of a challenging choice, but it'd be nice to visit other levels.
- Translation.  It's clear the staff tried, but some of the translation has flaws (though the Devs have been working on that).  This is more a warning - it's clear they worked pretty hard on this and they care.

So is it worth your time?  Yes, especially if you want a good FPS Roguelike.  The price is a bargain, there's a lot to the game, it will challenge you, and the devs are responsive.  Gunfire Reborn is an absolute treasure.  ""Generous"" is how I'd describe the game.

But who's it for?  As long as you don't mind Early Access:
* If the term ""FPS Roguelike"" tickles your fancy, really this is for you.  Your ship has come in (and it's loaded with monsters).
* If you like FPS games, but haven't done much Roguelike stuff,  you may like it.  The synergies may be appealing, and the replayability is nice.
* Did you like Borderlands?  Would you like the experience in Bite-Sized Chunks while also playing a bipedal dog mowing people down with dual-wielded elemental throwing knives?  Then buy it.",1592061995,1598043392,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,155,97,4471,0,304,1600830363,,

All this game lacks is content.

0,Gunfire Reborn,74655797,english,"Borderlands 2 came out when I was living in an all boys dorm in college. There is literally not a better scenario to have gone in on a 4-pack of keys from a german reseller, we had an amazing time spending hours in Pandora. When Borderlands 3 came  out in 2019 I was forced to accept that I was older, and I'm not willing to put the kind of time in those games ask. I remember how foreign the jokes suddenly seem, how much I wanted to not spend 30 hours looking for a gun I like.

I crave brevity. Borderlands is your drunk uncle talking about his time in the oilfields. I don't care, I don't want it. It was cute when I was younger.

Gunfire Reborn is small, the way book reports are small, and its not quite complete yet either. If I had to describe it, it's like playing a growing monster, something with tons of potential, but you can see all the soft bits still. Some of the menus have not been localized to English, and the unlockables are scant. There are few guns, and while shooting is crisp, your preference will largely be finding a gun that you dislike least. Buffs are small, meaningless things to my lizard brain, but I am stirred to min/max in good runs, few as they are. 

Runs are joyously short, my longest clocked at about an hour, which means you can get to bed on time, and because it's roguelike, friends who are more disposed to grind will still have fun playing with you solving a major problem.

It is still so thin feeling even in its best moments. Paradoxically, playing this makes me miss the bigger bordered lands, I wish to find greater paths of completion, dopamine stills and stagnates when I kill the 1000th clay soldier. Indeed, the whole game reeks of pacing issues, power curves linearly float above weaker enemies unless you've really fucked it, moments rarely feel tense, even in the boss fights. Vaults never feel risky, like I think they're supposed to feel, rooms where enemies are buffed never inspire trepidation. Malaise hangs over everything once you've seen the guns, the rooms, the traps. 

For 10 dollars, and the promise of more, this definitely worth it. Discomfort at the growing thing in the glass can be avoided by not looking too closely at the seams of pre-life, and there's a machine gun that reloads itself to keep occupied.

- Multiple fun and challenging difficulties.

- (At the time of writing this review) 3 unique characters with their own skill-trees and abilities.
- Bomb-doggo is best doggo.

Cons:
- Some language localisation issues. (improper grammar, etc.)
- (Nit-picking) 2D graphics - such as certain aspects of the HUD and floating text - are very low resolution and quite jarring. (to me)

Guess I got good, but I had over 400HP in the last fight due to the scroll that gives 1max HP if you kill an enemy. And I had 2 revives scrolls, and the ingame revive on the last boss, I used all of it. Remind you I went in blind.
And I got hit back to 30HP with no shields in one shot of the barrage, because I did not knew where it went, but after that I knew. And then the boss went into a second phase. Phew.
I won. Harsh battle but the updates certainly are showing. 

Certainly challenging, but rewarding. Still you need to know the boss or have tons of HP and revives as I had. 
High respect to the developer commenting to my review. The updates do show their improvements

--------------------------
[old review before the updates, negative]
No idea why this game has so many positive reviews, it certainly is a fun game for the dungeoniering, because everything else is nice skills, enemies being different, but the boss fight are terribly balanced, they are either too easy if you have the right weapons, or one or two shot you whilst the normal dungeon areas were very easy. 

Gun play is pretty good since it's about all projectile based. Elemental combos are alright. Enemies very different and great.
The problems with the boss fights are with attacks that instantly spawn on you, giving you barely any time to react. Maybe a second? The bosses do telegraph ''an attack'' but that is not when they are attacking. 
First boss his rock throw, the wind up animation means nothing, and then you get a red circle and 1 second to react or byebye half of your hp. You must save your 3 second dodge to evade this. Why? No idea, but if it's on cooldown, rip you.
Second boss is too easy, laser is pretty much instant, but you can evade out of it.
Third boss... instant barrage from where? Also instant kill with full hp and shields. Yay.

48,Gunfire Reborn,74632748,english,"This is the best game I have played in years. My best friend and partner play this game with me, it's like raiding with your best friends. Fast paced and the rogue like system gives you all the dopamine hits. New harder level was just on time for us as we were regularly clearing on elite mode. That said, the original character is easier to play than the other 2. I haven't figured out how to build them to work yet and the elemental system is too awesome to stop using in my opinion. I personally think the other characters need a tweak as we can clear on elite with the cat regularly but if any of us go either of the others, even with all their unique talents unlocked, we struggle, big time. Might just be a learning curve for the other characters but I am not so sure. Either way the game is well supported with regular updates and it seems like the developers care about the game and its content. A big key to regularly clearing was trading with your team, you can help them upgrade their weapons, reroll gemini and trade scrolls so you all have a well rounded build come the last dungeon and the last boss. I have some recommendations to make some scrolls that can't be dropped due to how they could be abused to be dropped but only a team member can pick it up, adding to the games current team play focus. This could allow players to pass on triple comeback for instance in order to help not only themselves but their allies. There is definitely room for that sort of mechanic to occur, scrolls intended to be passed through the team in order to clear the dungeon. The best part of this game is how it feels like an entire week of raiding in one run because of the rogue like format. It is satisfying to clear the entire dungeon and exciting every time you get a drop. The RNG component of this game forces you to adapt but more often than not provides a valid build. Our motto is trust in RNGesus. When we trust in RNGesus, we usually end up with everything we need to clear. Nightmare difficulty is a blast. We logged on late last night after the update, cleared it on elite in order to try a run on Nightmare and we got to the second boss before we wiped. It is much harder but so much fun.

Now regarding the game itself, the quality is insane. Weapons offer lots of different ways to play and the mechanics are very well made.

Sometimes you'll feel like your setup is garbage but that's ok, just die and upgrade overall stats with what you won so far (yes, you have skills that you can upgrade forever), and sometimes you'll end up with a setup so busted you basically take a crap on the last boss.

New character, new weapons, new enemies, new difficulty and voicelines as a bonus. Massive update, even paying full price for this feels like robbing the devs. They should actually consider increasing the price. Maybe with the next big update? At the very least once it comes out of Early Access.

Looking for Co-Op? Shooter? Crazy builds? Rogue-Lite? Must buy.

___________________________________

Frequent updates and fixes, satisfying gameplay and many things to try.

Fun gunplay, lots of options, interesting synergies, a lot of crazy effects to stack on your character.

Rogue-Lite shooter with persistent progression in the form of passive skills that make you stronger directly or give you more tools during gameplay.

Right now some upgrade and weapon choices feel a bit suboptimal while others are overwhelmingly powerful but you can always experiment and see if you find a good, new build. In any case there is a good variety of weapons and playstyles available.

Feels smooth and doesn't really have any problems functionally. Well worth a buy now, you can definitely get your moneys worth.

I've spent countless hours running through this over and over, enjoying every minute of it.

Until the update that was released today(8/19/20). We've waited so long for the bird.. and now he's here...... and he's .... melee based.

Melee should have never been introduced into this game and seeing as this has been implemented in this format it can only be a matter of time before melee weapons and a basic melee attack for the original characters is put into the game.

This will just cause alot of idiots to be rushing when they shouldn't and getting downed then crying to be picked up.

At which point the game will become just another bland knockoff of the same old stuff that panders to the less than casual audience  and it will stop being the amazing powerhouse that it was.

I am seriously saddened by this because I have seen too many games go downhill because of devs adding things or changing things that 5% of the community keep crying about constantly because they can't figure out how to overcome something or figure out how to deal with something. 

Maybe I'll check back and see if anything has changed in a year or so. Maybe it will have reverted out of this stage and continued on the original badass track that it was on. It was hella fun while it lasted.

Next to that is leveling up your skill power, how much ammo you have, how much damage you do, how much health you have, and how much shield power you have. That's also something to consider when you go through your trial and error.

The game is fun to play, and you will want to get better at knowing which enemy to deal with first and which one to deal with last, what weapon you prefer to use, which abilities you want to upgrade as you go though each level, which gun you want to fully upgrade or just have both upgraded once.

I appreciate it's replay value (primarily because of how your build can influence your strategy). The gunplay is good and the weapons have plenty of variation. The ""trick jumping"" rooms are fun. Multiplayer works well and is nicely integrated into Steam.

To me, the game is hard - but not too hard. Paradoxically, perhaps, I appreciate how the game can turn on you and end your run in seconds! :) 

I would have liked some more randomness/variation to the dungeons (you will learn them and they'll become quite predictable). I would also appreciate some more movement tech (such as iD-esque bunny hopping or rocket jumping), or at least a higher default movement speed.

Overall, an extremely polished early access release! It took me about 50 hours/80 levels to beat the game on normal mode in single-player. And I am now looking forward to do some more runs in Elite mode.

Roguelite + Borderlands is what I describe it as. Although, the random features that make borderlands loot so fun aren't really here. I have a short attention span, so spending 56 hours is CRAZY too me. My problem at the moment is by the 2nd level you tend to only use the same guns, because they are the most effective. 

So a lot of the guns are just simply there and really serve no purpose. In short, there are some clear balancing issues needed. By the 3rd map you could either just die, or you will just be rolling so overpowered that everything is dying instantly.

The ""craftsman"" guy is really pointless to me. The upgrade is just to little to have any benefit. I'd like too see the whole craftsman redone and make upgrading or ""transcribing"" the guns worth it.

 I would also like to see more than 2 classes, because at this point I've seen and done it all.

9,Gunfire Reborn,70235597,english,"Gunfire Reborn, for being a relatively new game in Early Access, I have to say you get what you pay for.

PROS:
- The kinds of guns you get all feel varied and often unique, from handguns, SMGs and shotguns to laser gauntlets and auto targeting beams.

- The small variety in room layouts means you don't know where you are going but you at least know how to get there.

- The difficulty feels like it scales rather well, the new players may struggle and that can be a bit of a grind but once you're a few hours in you get the hang of dodging and the types of attacks to expect.

CONS:
- The variety of enemies could do with a shake up down the road. Obviously more will always be better and add to the RNG but in its early stage, you know what you're up against and that can take away from the experience.

- The descriptions and localisation could do with a bit of a clean up to make things slightly clearer.

- The current lack of playable characters can often times feel stale considering the option to have 3 other friends tag along. However, this one will probably change once the games been out much longer.

Overall, if you follow the dollar per hour rule, you will get tons of enjoyment from this purchase and I hope to see the true potential over its lifetime.

28,Gunfire Reborn,74412053,english,"Although the game is currently in Early Access, it's fairly solid. Being by a HK/Chinese-based studio and featuring some questionable grammar and syntax in the store page, your first reaction might be that it looks like the many shovelware/asset flip type garbage games that are unfortunately cluttering the Steam store; not in this case!

Gunfire Reborn, to describe it better than the Steam Store page, is a rogue-like (or maybe rogue-lite; i honestly am not sure what the distinction is between those two terms) first person shooter, with semi-randomized guns a la Borderlands, that can be played solo or cooperatively (online), and some light RPG elements. You play as one of either two characters (only one of which is unlocked at first), running through rooms and fighting enemies until you reach a boss fight for the level; I would compare it to Risk of Rain 2, The Binding of Isaac, or probably its closest relative would be Immortal Redneck. Upon death, you can invest currency gathered during the run, called ""soul essence"", into levels in a skill tree, and you can't carry it over to the next run (at least, at first), so you're encouraged to invest as much as possible into whatever skills you can to improve your chances on the next run.

The combat gameplay is surprisingly solid for an Early Access game; there's great variety in weapons, and most if not all the guns I've tried have been fun to use and felt precise and fairly balanced. There are some status effect type things that can stack to broken levels pretty easily, but the game seems to be a ""give high damage, take high damage"" type affair, at least at the time of writing.

As I mentioned earlier, this game is still in Early Access, so you can expect a little glitchiness here and there, but it seems to mostly come in the form of visual disparities, like your co-op partner's gun looking different to you than to them, or certain effects not properly displaying to the other player. In about 30 hours of play, neither myself nor my friend I've been co-oping with have noticed much in the way of game-breaking bugs. However, the developers are actively soliciting feedback, so in the event that you do encounter any, you can send a report in-game very easily.

Because English is not the developers' native language, you may notice some funky looking grammar or word choice, and if I'm being honest, some of the names of scroll effects or guns read like they're items on a Chinese restaurant's menu, or like they weren't properly translated because maybe the original word doesn't have a good equivalent in English. Here's hoping that these little issues can be corrected before the game truly launches, but for now I'm giving it an 8 on the basis of fun, addictive co-op gameplay and the fact that it's only a $10 game.",1597595505,1597595505,TRUE,1,0,0.523809552,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,580,103,9434,0,9434,1597534516,,

The game starts off slow as you cannot make it that far because you gradually unlock new weapons, skills and scrolls as you play which makes you that little bit stronger in which you progress further and further until you finally beat the game!!

That is when Elite mode is unlocked which gives it that little bit of an extra challenge!!

This game is fun on a bun, it has really solid classic shooter game play (think Serious Sam, no crouch, no sights, just run and gun), it's easy to pick up and play, easy to join your friends, and you can get a satisfying run done in only 15 or so minutes. 

Even if that was all the game had, it'd still be pretty decent, but it layers on some genuinely satisfying roguelike elements (weapon modifiers, and random perks) that make every run feel super unique, and allow for some very interesting and unique play styles (want to be a triple dasher that shoots elemental bullets? totally doable!). The final icing on this cake is that gunfire even has a deep macrogame with persistent upgrades that keep you playing run after run (and many of the upgrades vastly expand the game's content...it's brilliant!).

Behind the point and shoot made by this very minimalist approach (graphically).
The wide variety of weapons and items give you a very wide range of possibilities. Even with only 2 characters (at the time of this review).

If you like some mechanics, you can make it good, very good. Though that is up to you finding the proper way to build it.
Beside some meta around (that will probably change over updates) nothing in strong, nothing is weak. Everything has potential.
This is the true skill of Gunfire Reborn, learning how to make a good use of this potential from what ever RNG the game gives you.

Gunfire Reborn have no story background, no character emotions and feelings, no voice acting. And that's a good thing, the game focus on the essential, the gameplay.

86,Gunfire Reborn,74121915,english,"Picked this game up on a whim after a friend of mine mentioned it to me. It sounded like everything I wanted! Even though I was given the early access disclaimer a few times, I couldn't help but want to try it. I've put some hours into Zigurat and a rogue-lite mod for Legend of Grimrock 2, but neither compare to this game.

It has elements of what I'd call an 'rpg-lite FPS game', though that's a fancy way of saying it's got some mechanics inspired by or lifted from Borderlands. Shields, simple damage types. However, unlike in borderlands, you have the rogue-lite element of incremental upgrades coupled with the finality of death ending your whole run. 

The meat of the game consists of repeatedly playing through the same 3 early-access 'levels', 5 strung together randomly generated rooms or landscapes with a random array of linear map-themed enemy progression, with a few accessible bonus rooms for extra random rogue-lite perks, and trying to successfully beat each level's unique boss.

However, most of your early experience in the game will likely consist of failing to beat the first level, or just getting a little past that and dying. Which is great! Currently, there really isn't too many levels. So replaying the same randomly generated rooms isn't so bad. That said, it is pretty early access. So you will encounter the same tiles and enemies, especially from the first level, quite often. Which can grow a little boring after an odd 8 hours into the game.

That said, the actual guns are quite fun. Unlike Borderlands, which has a long linear campaign to complete and progress through, there progression in Gunfire Reborn is basically set difficulty provided by the enemies you encounter in each level. So, while there are currently some basic weapons that naturally out-progress jankier alternatives, the jank weapons are still pretty usable and fun if you don't mind putting up with them.

The random modifiers on the weapons are quite a lot of fun too. Currently you obtain more modifiers on items by unlocking them in a between-run progression perk tree system. It's not terrible but it feels a little unbalanced. I'd prefer if from the get-go, you have the same amount of types of modifiers (called enhancements in-game), with the bonus chances at getting those modifiers coming from occult scrolls (the run-unique perks you obtain in-game from chests) Additionally, the games' developers do not seem to speak clear English, which is an issue as it hurts the clarity of many enhancements and occult scrolls.

Another criticism I have of the game, is that currently there is a single unique boss enemy for each level. This isn't necessarily a bad thing. It means you must learn how to fight each boss well in order to progress easily through repeat runs. But, the lack of variety means you get bored of fighting the flame tiger after run 6. Plus it makes it especially easy to beat the boss by simply planning ahead and picking up the strongest possible weapon to counter the bosses' defenses to easily surpass it. If the game had some alternative bosses, which may have very similar or the same abilities but with a different flavour or look, it would make replaying a little less disinteresting. Though preferably, the alternative bosses should have some different abilities, at a similar mechanical difficulty as the base bosses.

Beyond that, the game only has two classes playable at the moment. This is due to change soon, apparently the third character is being worked on. The classes are not too different from a siren and a gunzerker from Borderlands. The siren character is the default one you start with. They, like sirens, have a tree dedicated to elemental damage and proc chance, as well as a tree that focuses on improving their force-grasp ability. However the most interesting part of the siren-like character is their smoke grenade. Pretty cool that class-unique grenades are seeing a role here, as it reminds me of classic Team Fortress. I hope that more uniqueness is worked into the trees however, as currently the perks pretty boring passive upgrades, rather than game play changing choices. Arguably that's just their goal anyway, but I like the more situational improvements rather than straight power boosts.

The other character is the dogzerker. Puppo is pretty powerful, mostly due to his strong perks that hugely improve survivability during the guns akimbo ability. He also has a tree focused on improving grenade damage, and grenade damage in general. The third tree focuses on weapon damage and general weapon benefits gained from gunzerking. Honestly, I'd say he needs a nerf.

 At the very least, I think both and/or all classes may need to be nerfed a bit and given more interesting one-of-a-kind game-play changing perks. An example might be replacing the hex smoke perk tree with just a single point talent that makes the gas grenade do no damage, but still apply the effect of max Hex Smoke. A replacement perk for the doggo could be a perk that converts elemental damage on their currently handled weapon into explosive damage bonus for grenades & explosive damage in general. Another could be a perk that reduces fire-rate and damage during dogzerking, but that provides both the damage reduction and health increase that the max level perks of their current tree applies.

I'm not sure how I feel about survivability coming from the between-run perk tree. It feels a little broken, since you naturally make your own runs easier by having many hours sunk into the game. I know this is a common progression style in these kinds of games, but I find it pretty off-putting because of the little depth of game difficulty in it's current state. Right now, getting to around level 45-60 is enough to have both health and shields maxed, along with the first two unique perks of both classes, and a good handful of whatever else you want. By that point, it makes the early game pretty plum easy. Which isn't great, since in this kind of game, you want every level to be challenging.

Ultimately though, for the price it is currently, it's a bargain for the gameplay it offers. Borderlands set the bar but this game really runs with the idea in a very fresh direction. Aside from maybe Remnant, there aren't a ton of good FPS rogue-lite games. Zigurat was the only one I really knew of before this. The game does the concept justice and has pretty surprising replay ability in spite of it's early access circumstance. The game takes the idea of the elemental types from Borderlands but gives them their own spices, mixing two elemental afflictions on the same target gives them a new status effect! This is fantastic as it means using elemental weapons, even as a non-elemental character, has some potent benefit. I hope this concept is explored more in occult scrolls, since the afflict rate for most weapons is pretty meagre. 

I would recommend this if you have been searching for an exciting FPS rogue-lite game.",1597131026,1597131026,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,171,6,1303,0,1015,1597989824,,

A sort of support hero who can buff themselves (damage, critX, health/shield regen etc).

The primary ability could be a fire rate increase aura that can be upgraded to increase lucky shot and critX damage by 5, 10, and 25%.

25,Gunfire Reborn,74064439,english,"This is a pretty good roguelike fps. The game, as it currently stands, is a roguelike though three levels, with each level having 4 sections and a bossfight. The way player gets better in each game that they play is by acquiring ""occult scrolls"", ""ascensions"", and new guns in a run, similar to other roguelikes. Ho

[b]Good stuff:[/b]

The shooting: The shooting in the game is very approachable and understandable, without a too much upfront complexity, which stands in contrast to games like counter-strike, where the shooting has a pretty high amount of upfront complexity.

The levels: The levels are well-designed, and fun to run around and shoot in.

The aesthetic: A roguelike with an east asian aesthetic is a refreshing change of pace, the enemies and levels work well together in their design, and the design of the player's characters is pretty appealing.

The movement: The movement feels great, it's very responsive and understandable. It's very much on the floaty side, but that feels appropriate for the game and the playstyle that the game encourages.

The gun design: The design of the guns in this game is for the most part, very good. The knives look very cool, and the animal guns are very interesting. Even many of the ""normal"" guns have interesting flair to them which makes them satisfying to look at.

[b]Meh stuff:[/b]

The graphics: The graphics are servicable, but nothing really unique or special. Honestly, I think it works to the benefit of the game though, since the simple and uncomplicated graphics mean that this game very easily runs at high framerates, even on weaker machines.

The sound design: The sounds in this game are nothing special. If the volume is turned down while playing, the experience really isn't lessened too much. This is both good and bad. It's good because it's very easy to watch something else while playing this game. It's bad because it means that this game isn't really all that fun to listen to.

[b]Probably should be changed stuff:[/b]

1. Progression: The progression in this game is very slow, and feels very intentionally stunted. There are only two characters that can be played, and the second one can only be unlocked after what is almost always several hours of gameplay. The in-game progression system also takes a very long time to fill out, and goes very slowly.

2. The lack of content: There is really only one thing that can be done in this game, and it's very short, and very repetitive. There are 3 levels in total, and there are 4 sections and a boss fight in each level. These levels are almost always the same, and only have minor variations from run to run. There are also only two characters that can be played, even though there can be up to 4 people in a run.

3. The lack of player agency: The in-game mechanics heavily restrict the player's choices in how the play the runs. The power ups are randomized and the player has little to no choice in , removing the ability for the player to have a lot of choice in how the experience of the game plays.


[b]Recommendations for the stuff to change:[/b]

1: The multi-occult scroll chests need to become the norm, and not the extras. Switching the positions of the multi-occult scroll chests and the single occult scroll chests will allow players to have far more agency in how they create styles during the runs, and I think is likely a very easy way to do so. To maintain the balancing, make the multi-occult scroll chests have a slightly worse drop rate for the higher ranked scrolls, and make the single-scroll chests have a slightly higher drop rate for higher ranked scrolls.

2: Add either 1 or 2 more choices to the ascension chests at the end of each section. Having only three choices really limits the number of ways the player has to build a character, and makes a fully-realized build far less accessible.

3. Get rid of the restriction on carrying over soul essence from run to run. Honestly it's a stupid design decision, and the only way I can think of it making any sense is if the soul essence is planned to become an in-game currency that real money can be spent on. Even so, the restriction on carrying it over from run to run is still stupid, even in the context of it being something that can be paid for, and adds quite literally no value to the player playing the game. Smack whichever manager or game designer thought of the restriction, and remove it from the game.

4. Add more levels to both the standard adventure, and more gamemodes that can be played. I'm sure this is already in progress, but it still needs to be said. Honestly, a combined shooter-platformer mode I think would be a great addition to this, and I think that the beginnings of that idea are present in some of the vault levels. 

Extra recommendations:

1. This one might be hard, and really isn't that necessary, but make the coloring and design of the guns more dynamic or varied. The design of the guns is very good, but perhaps make the coloring or effects of them respond to inscriptions that they have, or perhaps make them have a few predetermined combinations of colors that can be randomly selected from upon generation. I said earlier that I like the design of the guns, and I stand by that. However, I think that they can be better.

2. There should also be multiplayer lobbies. I'm sure that this is also already in development, but being able to play with random other people, instead of just people who are on the steam friends list would be a great addition to this game.

3. Add some character customization options. I think that for multiplayer especially, having some character customization could really help, and also make the characters being played become much more interesting.

If the developers are reading this, I do hope that the recommendations reach the people who can do something about it. I do very much enjoy this game, and I hope to see it improve and become a fully-fleshed out version of itself, rather than what it is currently.",1597035494,1597035494,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,302,6,4735,332,402,1601927415,,

- NG+
- Difficulty above Elite
- Looping mode
- More areas/bosses

99% of the runs I've done have been bug free, and each one completely different to the last in every way.

Really enjoyable by the fact that almost every run makes you feel more powerful than the last.

Gunfire Reborn a first-person rogue shooter. While the game has plenty or work left before it's done, the core game play is solid. You travel through stages with progressively more difficult enemies. After you inevitably die, you upgrade skills with points you earn while playing, making the character more powerful and able to go further on the next run. 

It will take a while before you can beat the first boss. Don't be discouraged, you have to level up a bit but eventually you won't have too much trouble. At first I thought the progression was too slow, but after playing for a while I think it's actually pretty good.

Gun-play is excellent and fairly will balanced. Weapons look good and feel good to use. More weapons are unlocked as you play at a satisfying rate and the variety is really cool. Weapons can have enhancements that increase their damage potential or cause other effects.

84,Gunfire Reborn,73451442,english,"Post-Edit: I just beat the game at its highest difficulty- This game is easily worth the price tag.
TL;DR: I've had a 10/10 experience so far, and it's at a more than fair price-point to boot.
I'm a sucker for a good Roguelike, and when I was only 2 hours in, I could already tell it was a good one.
Pros:
- Charming
- Nostalgic references from other popular games (Counter-Strike, Borderlands, Destiny, etc.)
- Plenty of guns and passive skills (Occult Scrolls) that are all diverse- None of them seem completely inferior so far. A lot of it depends on the 'Inscriptions' (rolls) you get on the weapons.
- Very small file size (2.18 GB on disk)
--- Not graphically intensive, so you should be able to run it at high FPS with no issue whatsoever.
   ----- While it is a low-polygon style, it's quite charming.
- I don't feel like any of my deaths were because of some BS, all of them were my mistakes.
- You can drop your 'Occult Scrolls' (Passives) you collect throughout a run if you need to- Great idea. (Except curses ofc)
- You can get some pretty awesome and powerful combinations of rolls on weapons and passives
  --- Weapons can even get completely unique rolls to those weapons: One was a pistol that you can throw and it detonates, (Like a Tediore weapon in Borderlands,) and the more rounds it has in its magazine, the more times it detonates.
  --- Even if you get bad RNG, you can still work your way through content fine, just not as quickly.
- This game seems to have pretty solid online connectivity too- I was able to play with one of my friends that has bad internet, even during times that he normally can't play most other games.
   --- Playing this game together with others makes it feel so much better- Both in that the scaling actually starts to feel like it's where it needs to be, and that you can trade stuff around.
--------------------
Cons:
- There are some grammatical/spelling errors in the English translation
- At this time, the game can be very tedious as you do runs through the same three areas over and over... This will most likely be resolved in the future, seeing as this game is still pretty early into its life cycle.
--------------------
I went over some of the highest up-voted negative reviews, and I'm going to give my own feedback on some of their statements here in an attempt to make this review a more complete perspective into the game.

--- ""Movement speed is too slow, especially when using heavy weapons""
For how large the levels are, and the scale of everything considered, the movement speed does feel SLIGHTLY too slow, but not so much as to be a 'Con' of the game.
Also, they're 'heavy' weapons for a reason. You're more than free to switch to your Foundry (Starting pistol) at any given time to have your higher move speed moving around outside of combat. Otherwise, it's just a factor to have to consider when in combat.

--- ""Precision platforming feels awful""
There are some Parkour/Kreedz (For you CS players out there) bonus levels in the game, however this game has a complete lack of self-momentum on movement. I understand how that can make platforming difficult or frustrating, but again, I wouldn't say this is a 'Con' of the game. You can change directions mid-air and move at full speed in a different direction if you like, and you can also dodge in mid-air.

--- ""Enemies with tracking weapons are too powerful""
Nearly every enemy in the game that has a tracking weapon can be dodged simply by running perpendicular to them. Otherwise, the game even tells you itself in a load screen tip- If you don't have a tanky build, then cover is your next best option.

--- ""The difficulty curve is too sharp""
Someone said the only viable strategy at times was to cower behind a rock and pick shots at enemies... That's not true at all. Perhaps if you get bad luck and you're lacking sustain options, sure... But if you have a strong build, you can rain hell on anything that dares to even so much as look at you funny.

--- ""The upgrade system feels like artificial padding""
While I admit the game lacks a lot of content to try and be standing on its own two feet, the upgrades are simply there to help you along as you play the game more. This is definitely supposed to be a game that you play for the sake of playing, not to be a completionist.
Another review said this game is 'Grind To Win'... Again, it's really not. The upgrades are there to compliment the game, not being necessary to get far.
First time I ever beat this game on the hard difficulty, I wasn't even half of the max level.

--- ""A recent update severely nerfs and punishes solo players""
What??? I think this game is too easy solo! I feel like the scaling with 4 players is the way the game is meant to be played.

--- ""Dashes take you a pitiful distance meaning you often can't do anything meaningful about your situation.""
They may take you a short distance, but they do it rather quickly. That, and dashes do actually have a short amount of i-frames in them. You can see this to great effect if you make it to the first boss, and try to use your dodges to physically avoid attacks, and to i-frame through attacks.

--- ""Obvious skill-grenade combo doesn't work because there's an unnecessary delay after skill use.""
The two currently existing characters actually have different grenade-throwing delays on them. I feel like this is an intentional balancing factor, not an arbitrary design decision.

--- ""Jump height is low enough to make attempts to climb to high ground annoying.""
If you jump while running into a ledge, you'll actually more or less 'step' up the ledge, removing any extra dead time in the air there would have been. Any situation in which you might have tried to jump repeatedly to get to high ground probably wasn't intended to be used as such in the first place.",1596004184,1596923323,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,335,10,3407,0,130,1597945263,,
85,Gunfire Reborn,73995634,english,"I am new to roguelike games, but have always been a fan of looter-shooters, such as the classic Borderlands. When I arrived to the first boss in this game, I got destroyed, and figured this genre was going to take some getting used to. However, the skill tree helped me quickly gain the extra damage and shield I needed, along with some other useful perks. The vaults are fun, I only needed to look up one parkour puzzle, which feels rewarding when finished. The occult scrolls pair well together, such as making yourself 1 HP with one, and then gaining DMG based on % missing health from another. This makes for some extremely fun builds, which get even better from the golden goblets. I personally play Ao Bai, the dog character, but the cat is fun and always useful to have on a team. I normally play with friends, but I have absolutely no problem playing this game solo, it truly doesn't get old. For the price point, this is easily the most entertaining game I have played in years.

..After more than 200h played, i can tell you, this game is great!


-si il paraît vraiment difficile au début, plus vous montez en niveau (120 pour le moment) plus il est facile. Ceci dit étant encore en early et au vu des mises à jours régulière, (une par semaine à peut près) ce n'est qu'une question de temps avant de voir apparaître d'autres niveaux de difficultés.
..It can appear realy difficut at first but the more you play the more easy it become. also, considering that the game is still in early access and patched realy often, i'm sure that difficulty will rise very soon.

-Ce qui est le plus frappant à mon sens est le rapport qualité/prix de ce bijoux. 10 euros!! Je suis bien incapable de vous dire depuis quand j'ai pas été autant satisfait de dépenser si peu pour m'amuser autant sur un jeu.
..What hited me the most  is such a low price for such a good game. I cant even remember when was the last time i felt this much satisfaction by buying a game: low invest for so much fun!!

-Il faut compter 20/30 heures sans être trop mauvais pour débloquer la majorité des éléments disponible mais bien le triple voir plus pour vraiment faire le tour de tout les builds possibles et imaginables. Perso j'ai passé les 200 heures et je m'amuse toujours autant. nouvelles armes, nouveaux scrolls (buffs/passifs) et bientôt un nouveaux perso jouable (fin aout).
Quelques bugs de tmps en tmps mais sans impacte profond sur le fun et le gameplay.
Pas mal de builds possible qui rendent chaques run différent d'une partie à l'autre.
..You can count about 20/30 hours to unlock almost all content in this game but the triple and may be more to realy  try everything that you can do and soon there will be more! (new weapon, new playable character...) And if there is few litle bugs, they are realy not impacting the game experience and fun. So much build possible make every game different than the last one.

-Parlons des défauts:
..Let's talk about cons:

-Le plus important selon moi est qu'il n'y a que 3 niveaux, comptez entre 45 minutes et une heure pour un run complet et bien que cela reste honorable, ça peut vite devenir répétitif.
..The most important to me is the fact that there is only 3 level for now. A run is about 45/60 minutes long and even if this is honorable for a 10box game, it can fast become repetitive.

-Uniquement 2 niveaux de difficulté à ce jour et j'espère sincèrement qu'il y en aura très rapidement d'autres.
..Only 2 lelve of difficulty for now and i realy hope that there will soon be more.

-quelques armes vraiment en dessous des top tiers, personne ne s'en sert mais ce n'est qu'un petit défaut très temporaire au vue de la fréquence des maj, pas mal on déjà été rééquilibrés.
..Few weapon realy under the others, no one using it but the dev are on it. Some  already got up and i'm sure some other will be soon.

- impossibilité de se reconnecter à une parti en cours apres un crash ce qui lors d'un bon run peut être très frustrant mais qui demeure tout de même très rare (cela a du m'arriver deux ou trois fois en tout et pour tout).
..there is no way to reconnect to a game if you crash and that can realy be very frustating if it happend during a good run but it is realy rare( happenned to me about 2 or 3 time only).

-Les boss qui hors mis en solo manque vraiment de difficultés mais encore une fois je suis certain que cela va rapidement changer.
..Boss fight are too easy if you're not playing solo but again, i'm sure that will change soon.

//
Disclaimer: I'm only posting this as incentive for developers to improve upon the game, and will change the review accordingly as base premise of the game is promising.

The reason why I'm giving a negative review at this point of time is due to little to no incentive to repeat runs apart from farming talent points.

Hear me out - when I think of rouge-like games like Binding of Isaac (where i have 200+ hours), I'm thinking of completely different runs on every replay. I WANT to go for another run because there are lots of power-ups and they change the game dramatically. In some runs you're extremely underpowered, in some you're overpowered, mechanics of your character change etc.

In Gunfire Reborn each run feels EXTREMELY similar as last one. Yes, gunplay is fun however I don't see this game as 'roguelike' because weapon drops, power ups, skills change little of how game is played.

So basically if devs find more ways to diversify gameplay experience and add much more skills/guns/mechanics on how you can go through the game, I can easily see losing myself in the game.
At the moment, however, I'm stuck rerunning same exact stuff with little to no incentive on replaying runs apart from grinding talents.",1596563918,1596812641,TRUE,0,0,0.518290639,1,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,186,15,2240,0,294,1599046818,1596784788,"Thanks for your interest, we will add more content and optimize the gameplay in the future update, stay tuned."

I think that the first couple hours of play may be the most difficult. But once you've unlocked a few items and learned how to deal with some of the enemies, the game clicks and opens up a lot. The more you level up the more interesting the game becomes. Since you unlock new scrolls (abilities) and weapons by leveling and doing challenges, the more you play, the more dynamic the game becomes! This also gives you the time to learn about the scrolls/weapons as you unlock and discover them. Which is great because that means you aren't overloaded with a ton of information at the start. These are just guesses are far as numbers, but there are probably: 100+ different scrolls, 40+ weapons, 30+ character power-ups and 30 persistent character abilities (which are permanent and chosen as you level up). So the fun being how those all work together on different runs. Some runs you get really amazing scrolls that work well with your current weapon. Other times you may not find scrolls you are used to, but the scrolls you do find have you play in a different ways in order to take advantage of their design and fusions together. Endless combinations! and when you have a good run with scrolls and weapons that work well together you can absolutely SLAY and it feels f***ing great!!! I love this game.

It's also pretty difficult, at least for me, having experience with rogue-likes but not much experience with FPSs; still, with the amount of explosive weapons, for example, there is plenty for a non-experienced player to enjoy and practice with.  

My only complaint is that some of the locations are a little empty, and there are some parts where you're walking around or waiting for enemies to show up, but that also depends on the playthrough as the paths are randomized; the empty hallways and dead-ends is a nice aesthetic touch, that you're visiting the same locales but carving different paths through them each run, but it also doesn't really mesh with the action aspects of the game.  And while the aesthetics are amazing, the music and sound effects are lack-luster.  Plus it could use some translation issues; most of it is passable and charming, but some weapon or upgrade descriptions are vague and easily misunderstood with the rough translation and formatting. 

Other than that, fantastic :)",1596773471,1596773471,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,75,1,2291,0,1328,1597962225,,
63,Gunfire Reborn,73894319,english,"I have put in quite a surprising amount of time on this game considering it is considered an Early Access, and surprisingly have only a couple things to pick at. Overall, this game is smooth, fast paced, action filled, and combines strategy with run and gun pretty dang well. If you just start up it does take a bit to finally be able to pass the first boss, but it comes with playing. It only takes 1-2 runs before you know most the enemies and get to the boss reliably. Now, all i have to say negatively about this game is that 
1. There is currently no form of melee in the game either in weapons, or a default punch attack for people that get to close when you run out of ammo
2. The bosses scale WAY too much from playing solo to with a group. The first boss sits at 80k health at single player, but add just one more person they scale 3x health up to 240k. That to me is a bit excessive. I like to play with just me and my friend or my wife, but i feel like we never scale up to match that multiplier. We can barely get past it unless we get a completely broken set up.
Overall: This game is very fun, very action packed, and very entertaining. The few complaints i had are completely bearable, just things i hope will change sometime in the near future.

It's VERY EARLY ACCESS.  

I'm going to keep playing it but I cannot recommend it for what it currently is.  This game needs a ton of work still.  

[b]The good[/b]

- Permanent Hero skill tree
- Interesting guns
- Two characters (better than one I guess)
- Good gun hit indicators.  It has a slight arcade like feel to it which is nice.  
- A lot of replay value I guess.

[b]The Not so good[/b]

- The lack of guns.  In the first area you'll have maybe 10 different guns, I think it's less than that until you unlock them.  You'll get used to them very fast and you'll probably be getting bored of them with how often you have to run through the first level.

- The first boss is atrociously over powered for single players.  [spoiler]It has 80k hp and your guns at first do ~100-200 dmg on hit.  Oh and all of his abilities one-shot you.  Also he regens his shield which takes about 30 or so rounds to deplete a few seconds after it depletes.  Unless you get an ability to augment your dash, I think it's either impossible to solo him at first or may as well be.  Your dash has a 3s cd and sometimes the boss will use more than 1 ability in that window.  [/spoiler]

- The upgrades on death are really lackluster and you don't really feel too much stronger. +5max shield, wooo the boss STILL ONE SHOTS ME SO WHAT'S THE POINT.  

- EVERYTHING is randomized.  Okay so at the end of every round you open a chest that has an elemental skill upgrade with 3 choices in it.  Let's say you're on round 2/5 and you want to go poison, you have a poison weapon and you take the poison choice.  Next round, there's no poison choice.  It's now round 5/5 and you haven't gotten a better poison weapon and you haven't seen another elemental poison reward choice.  So basically you're fucked and you get to shoot the last boss in the face like 2500 times and hope you don't mess up once or you're dead.  

I have yet to play with friends.  Maybe it's better.  

I want to like this game but I just don't and it [b]ABSOLUTELY DOES NOT DESERVE 95% APPROVAL[/b].  Far too low of standards.

68,Gunfire Reborn,73733489,english,"TLDR: Love this game it's a steal for the price.

Pros: Runs great, consistent high frame rates on my PC easily hitting 144 frames with an i5 and GTX 1080. Gunplay and weapon variety is excellent. High skill while still having the random nature of roguelite games. Lot's of replay value with tons of unlocks to chase if the core gameplay loop appeals to you. Enemy variety is great in my opinion with lots of different types of choreographed attack patterns and weaknesses to learn and master. The designs of weapons are a joy to play with many standouts and few ones which are not useful. Art design and aesthetic may not appeal to everyone but I think it's quite a gorgeous game personally though the better looking stuff is in the later levels. Co-op is awesome fun as usual.

Cons: Not a ton of content as far as having tons of levels and only 2 characters, however, for the price this makes sense + its early access so more to come. Peer to Peer connections for matchmaking can be unreliable and sometimes downright unplayable with lag. This lag problem has been steadily improving and the devs have said they are aware. It used to often be unplayable for me but now I rarely get lag, still worth noting though (This of course isn't an issue if you like playing solo). If you don't like getting screwed over by random chance bad drops this might not be for you but it's the nature of roguelites so not really a true Con just worth noting.",1596520125,1596520125,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,71,1,2055,48,1933,1601437357,,

17,Gunfire Reborn,73690316,english,"Wow - having a lot of fun with Gunfire Reborn. 

First up, the games name is appropriate. This is a First Person Shooter with Rogue like/RPG'ish and randomisation elements combined into an enjoyable, yet challenging game with a fresh take on the FPS genre.

The game design is not complicated but it still rewards strategy with pairing skills with weapons or play styles but you never feel like you need to get out a spreadsheet to min/max. Not that kind of game and it's so refreshing because of this.

Also do not expect to be micro managing tonnes of loot every gunfight stressing over which items to hold to carry back to town etc. Again, not that kind of game but you still get choice and randomisation every play through.

The designers have done a great job in making an accessible, easy to get into yet challenging and fun game with out being overly complex or bogging the player down in menus, item management etc.

Graphics, sound, frame rate are all excellent and the glowing reviews are justified. Playing on a 4770k 16 GB 2400mhz Ram and a 2080 RTX Ti 1440p 120 FPS without a frame drop.

One other thing I'd like to mention also is not to let the cartoon style graphics make you think this is another cheaply made and hurriedly pushed out title like so many games that seem to flood the steam marketplace and provide very little entertainment. 

Effort, planning and a lot of play testing has clearly been invested in this game and it honestly plays like a fully developed title.

Seriously, this game is probably the best value game on steam (considering it's quality design,fun and replayability). Usually games go up in price when they come out of Early Access so if you are sitting on the fence my recommendation is snap this up now and enjoy.

Two thumbs up and my respect to the game developers for their excellent efforts.

I was recommended this game by a friend as it fit *some* of the things I enjoy - the RNG gunplay of Borderlands, the movement of Destiny, and it has multiplayer without the horrifying plague of PvP.  It fit some of this, but not all of it. It was not trying to be a clone and it wasn't a dead copy.  ""Sure, I thought. Lets give it a try!""

I am so glad I did.

I gave it a try.  At first, I died... a lot.  Then I leveled up, and I died less and less.  Then I got good at the game, and I hardly die at all.

All night marathon sessions with friends, clutch revivals in the heat of battle, and a progression and reward system that make me feel like the time and efforts I put into the game are valid and fun.  My friends and I have been rampaging around this game for many hours both solo and as a group and its so far been worth every hour.

I've even gone so far as to get this game as a gift for friends that are saving every penny owing to COVID-19.  Seriously, its stupid amounts of fun for (at time of writing) about $12.

The studio making this are not English as First Language, so expect some typos and expect some translation errors, but the core concept is solid.  Also, most every item does exactly what it says it does, and there is no odd formulas about weapon damage.  If it says ""adds damage"" that is exactly what it does.

Overall, for $12 you get an insane deal.  This was (at time of writing, 44 hours in!) a smash sleeper hit and I love it for a simple, easy, FUN game I can run with my buddies and put down again for more serious games as needed.

This game is extremely satisfying to play as you progress. Its gunplay gives a vibe similar to Borderlands, with semi-randomly generated areas. No run goes the same as the last, and it's fun to build off the hand the game deals you. It becomes more fun as you learn what builds to aim for, and you learn how to combat various tricky enemies. 

However, you can certainly tell that it's got some work to do. Currently, the three levels you progress through do not ""loop"" like you'd expect, and it simply ends there, and elite mode is easier than it sounds. There are also only two characters right now. Despite this, it's well optimized, it has plenty of guns and upgrades, and there's a nice variety of enemies to fight. It's worth more than its price and I can't wait to see what they'll add to the game next.

Also, the bosses at the end of each area actually FEEL like bosses. They're not overly complicated but are also very punishing foes. I'd say rather than reading a guide for them, experience them yourselves and learn their moves.

You will sink a ton of hours here with your friends or by your self. The replay value is insane and it is very addictive when you start sinking skill points into your character and start to become more and more overpowered. But you will still face challenges, as you play with more of your friends the game becomes very difficult or if you are solo you can try the Elite Mode once you successfully kill the final boss for better loot and increased difficulty. Overall it is one of my favorite games to come out this year!",1596174359,1596174359,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,303,6,2627,0,1685,1600401226,,

This game might be too easy for those of you who are hardcore in to shooting games like csgo/valorant etc.
But for more casual gamers this game is extremely fun.
You've got lots of diffferent ways of beating the game. 
likely ull find urself  choosing whether u want hp or shield build when it comes to defence, or maybe even a hybrid of both.
on offence theres so many choices. do u want to be a sniper. do u want to take advantage of the no reload scroll for a big explosion gun that normally has to reload after each shot fired. or do u want to do spread aoe elemental effects, 2 at a time as well with shared damage type gemini.
do u have no dash related scrolls and find the no dash but fast move speed scroll. or do u have lots of scrolls that benefit based on ur dash usage as well as other scrolls that give u more dashes and half the cd on ur dash.
u find a gun that benefits from lucky shot, but weakens ur shots if they're not lucky shots? then u also got lots of scrolls that give u lucky shot chance. to get a bit of a lucky shot build going.

thers lots of choices to be made constantly. 
Scrolls can be dropped and traded amongst team mates, allowing for ur team to work together to achieve powerful builds. 
Also this is a rogue-lite game. meaning every time u die u spend soul essence that u've gathered. u spend it on upgrades in a sort of post game skill tree shop type thing. I really like this system as it makes me want to go back out there every time after a run has ended to try again with the new stuff i just bought.

For anyone considering buying this. Please do, this is not one of those shitty early access fails, this is a full game with a lot of content and a LOT of fun replayability.

81,Gunfire Reborn,72363968,english,"the combat is fun so the game will be entertaining for a few dozen hours but it's definitely way too much RNG reliant, even for a rogue like. can be especially frustrating because of the wide array of weapons, of which half are outright bad weapons and the fact that it's likely you'll enjoy playing only a few of the weapons, and so you'll only get a decent weapon you like to play once every 4 or 5 runs. i won't even speak of having a good weapon you like and good talents / scrolls, never happened to me in 22 hours ( although non afk time must be something like 17 or 18 hours. )
i wish the roguelite elements were more like risk of rain 2.

though the guns are well designed ( you won't like all of them but everyone will like different weapons and they're all well designed ), the feeling is good when shooting the guns, nice variety of enemies ( which are also well designed, for the most part ) and the fights can be very dynamic depending on what weapon you're playing with. 
so the combat feels great when you finally get a weapon you like with decent perks.

Also be warned the game is hard, you'll get yourself one shot out of nowhere and that's normal, you'll have to keep playing in order to develop a good feel of the game and then you won't be surprised by a rude instakill anymore. well most of the time.

Last thing, as i said the game is imo way too RNG reliant to be interesting in the long term BUT it is in early access and the devs are actively looking for feedback, so maybe they'll change that, it's not guaranteed but it's a maybe.

So in the end i'm recommending the game, even if they never ""improve"" the roguelite elements by making them less RNG reliant ( especially concerning weapons ), you can still get a few dozen hours out of it for 10 bucks, that's totally worth it.

edit : and here we go, they're already updating the scrolls and perks to make it less reliant on lucky perks/scrolls/weapons combos, the devs are doing a great job, I definitely recommend the game, it's already worth much more than its price and I have got the feeling it's only going to get better.",1594300230,1596029215,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,124,46,2995,24,1430,1601128187,,

Combing scrolls, skills and weapon rolls makes it interesting every time. Especially when you get lucky and manage to ""break"" the game with certain op combo's. Playing with friends and having a bigger loot pool (drops are per player) allows you to do more swapping and adjusting.

Destiny and enter the gungeon had a weird indie baby

Pros:
-Very fun yet simple shooting mechanics.
-Every run you do is randomized. Every time you play you will encounter different guns, rooms, and perks like any other rougelite.
-Every weapon comes with randomly rolled stats so no two weapons feel exactly the same.
-Game is actually challenging
-Variety of enemy types
-Game is $12...that alone was enough for me to buy it.

Cons:
-Game is still in early access. This does not take away the positives of the game because it runs smoothly, however I feel that there definatly needs to be more weapons and characters added to this game soon. (This game is 4 player co op yet there are only 2 characters at time of review.)
-The level up system can feel a bit grindy
-At the start of the game most of the enemies can very easily kill you, however its fine because you can very easily kill them. It becomes a problem when you start progressing through the floors, it adds more enemies, they all have more health bars, yet you are just about as squishy as you were when you started off.",1595861096,1595861171,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,98,24,563,438,124,1601843543,,

The game is quite hard until you get some practice and invest in some talent points. Even with 20 hours in I'm still having trouble with the final boss (there's 3 for now).

My biggest complaint is runs take forever (1.5 hours~ ). I'd like a mode that is very hard but short. I could just play till the first boss, but it's no longer challenging so not a great option. OR just allow us to save run so my friends and I can just hop in and out whenever we have time.

Game has a lot of potential. I really like that even though it is grindy, it doesn't feel like it at all.

For the Devs: I think some of the descriptions for scrolls have been translated slightly wrong. Some of them are a bit vague, or don't actually do what they say or miss certain details.

77,Gunfire Reborn,73338348,english,"As much as I would love to give this game a positive review and a recommendation of how quite fun and quirky this game is for a roguelite FPS, this game suffers from a lot of flaws in a lot of some unbalanced issues, repetitive stages, bullet sponge enemies, and some things that ticks me off and I'm sure some players do too.

First of all, this game has quite the unique aspects to it although albeit just copying off from other big title games. It's quite fun, yes, but the longer you play the more you start to see the flaws and little itches that kinda annoys you once you start to experience them quite often.

For the positives: this game is kinda unique on its own, can be quite fun, the character models, NPCs, enemies, and level design are nicely done, and this game does deserve the hype it gets until we get to those flaws and issues I will say about this game.

The negatives: Gameplay is quite unbalanced in my opinion, you're left to just praying to RNGesus that you get the best weapons for your style of gunplay and the best scrolls that works with your gunplay/gameplay. Next the movement speed, I feel the movement speed is quite slow and the dodge is not as good or nearly nonexistent, yes you can hide behind things like pillars, stones, columns, etc., but dodging is another story and sometimes you fall flat of dodging some attacks even when you think you've cleared it. In short ""The dodge range is just SHORT"". Then there's the issue of enemies just being bullet sponges the further you advance into the game even when you think you got the best equipment already, then sometimes you just get thrown into a room with enemies right in front of you and suddenly you're dead (happened to me quite often when going into the next room enemies just suddenly spawns right around you all firing their weapons and BOOM! you're dead), even with upgrading your shield and health I still feel that enemies can kill you quite easily when you're not paying 100% attention to them, but even if you are paying attention to things like where enemies just suddenly spawns next to you when just coming into a room it wouldn't be your fault but the game's fault. And some of my nitpicks on this are like when sniping enemies notice you too quick even when you're far out of their range and some can still manage to shoot you and kill you so you can't snipe enemies from afar, you need to always keep moving. Some weapons can be OP and some can be so weak that you're better off just using your starting weapon. Health pickups are sometimes too sparse especially when you need one in a pinch making you left with getting one from the NPC but even then you can only buy one health recovery from them and still wouldn't be healed to 100% which makes it tough once you get to the bosses.

Overall, this can be quite the fun game, it's quite unique, the design is alright, and I'm sure it can improve once it comes out of early access, but the things this game can offer right now is just a momentary fun experience not something I personally think would be an awesome game to go back to play with over and over, but even then playing it over and over can get quite boring with the state the game is in right now.

The shooting and weapons feel amazing, the art style is delightful, and I don't have a third thing but you get the picture. Pretty fun time especially for an Early Access title.

Where this game falls short at is the movement. You trudge along at a gentle walk and the ""dash"" is pitiful. For a game with perfectly appealing shooting and enemy gameplay to hop on the ubiquitous ""rogue"" bandwagon, I'd expect you to be like a little glass cannon vaulting about in desperate combat to get enemies before they get you. When I am pushed into a small room with 6 enemies who push and 3 enemies who are sniping, the 1 foot dash and waist-high hop does me little good.

The most infuriating part of this experience wasn't the 'git gud' aspect that a lot of souls-like games hide behind, but the fact that I had discovered so many unique weapons that felt so good to use, only to get done in because I was unable to strafe or outmanuever an enemy correctly. 

What it comes down to is just picking a spot with cover and dancing around the obstacle like a game of peek-a-boo. And it's rather boring.

There may very well be a double jump, multi-dash, sprinting, or some grappling hook feature hidden in the upgrade tree  but I can't really see myself sticking with this title that long to find out.

-Interesting Upgrade system to keep every run from feeling the exact same

Cons:

-Weapon drops are a little rare early

83,Gunfire Reborn,73232230,english,"An extremely satisfying game loop. As my friend says, ""It's Borderlands without the commitment"". Personally, I wasn't a fan of Borderlands, but this game is fantastic. It offers a familiar yet dynamic experience each time you start a run. The maps are always the same, but the path you take is often different. The weapons, and scrolls you find along the way are mostly random, and it's extremely easy to pickup without much explanation. 

The core game is fantastic and I can't wait to see what they add next. 

The following is not a statement about any existing features in this game, but what I would be delighted to see implemented in the future:

[spoiler]Personally, I think we've got all of the gameplay components for a really fun and exciting PVP experience. I have never enjoyed any Battle Royale game that I've played before, but between the Occult Scrolls, Ascensions, and Weapon variety we see in the game, there's more than potential for something new and refreshing.[/spoiler]

[spoiler]Obviously, the current net code probably isn't designed to accommodate the scale of a game like PUBG for instance, but it might be worth exploring. Perhaps even a MOBA FPS game type, you could reuse the assets of the NPCs we see in the core game. Granted, this type of game would probably add a lot of overhead cost for servers to adequately[/spoiler]

[spoiler]Even if you just went the Deathmatch route, it could still be fun, even if it's not well balanced (And I wouldn't even suggest trying to balance it). Gungame or other objective based game modes (KotH, CtF, etc) could be interesting too. Just an idea that crossed my mind.[/spoiler]

Even if none of what I mentioned above ever gets implemented into Gunfire, I still think it's a spectacular game that's made me reminisce about my favorite game of all time, the now defunct Gunz: The Duel. I spent over 35,000 hours playing that game, with at least 10,000 of those hours spent doing Quest mode, which is a similar game loop without the dynamic experience of scrolls and random weapons. The bosses in particular remind me of Gunz. 

Thank you so much to the Devs for creating a fun game that captures some of the fun from my favorite game that I can no longer play.

Gameplay is a bit repetetive. Esp. the initial dungeon could do with 2 or 3 more room designs.

* Wonky geometry. I keep getting stuck in tight spaces and at corners for no obvious reasons.
* Wonky input. Sometimes input is not being processed. E.g. try triggering talent and a granade in rapid fashion. 2nd action is not being performed (I am on an NKRO keyboard).
Both usually end with you getting killed while you back out or check the cool downs only to find them ready to go. Frustrating and unnecessary.

Additionally: The user interface gives you non-choices. How would you like to spend those soul essences you can't spend because you don't have enough. WTF?

issues for devs to look at: 
Please remember which difficulty was last played.  Each time I restart the game, it goes back to normal and I click play, have to quit, come back, change to elite, then restart.  Really just a QOL. 
The monks in 3rd stage that teleport might be bugged?  2 times I got insta gibbed by them and have no idea how as I was full health and shield and all I know if one teleported behind me and im dead instantly with no reaction time.   If its a sort of backstab ability...its pretty unfun and hard to counter in a 1st person view.   Either should be changed or fixed bug...very lame way to die and very little counterplay to it.

More stages / bosses. 
Starting chest should have more than 3 choices or maybe a reroll or two.  Its fairly minor since they are +0 weapons but would help at least get something you may enjoy as many times the 3 choices are terrible.

97,Gunfire Reborn,73222909,english,"Gunfire Reborn is a pleasant surprise that succeeds in mixing different game mechanics from the roguelite/FPS genre to provide a fun experience in solo or coop. In short:

- a FPS projectile-based gameplay with good feedback and responsiveness, 
- a variety of weapons, passives (called ascensions) and situational bonuses (called scrolls) obtained as random drops that provide different playstyles,
- build choice during runs is impacted by drops and random weapon modifiers ""ala A-RPG"",
- classic roguelite experience (level progression, drops and currency is lost on death) but,
- permanent passive unlocks (called talents) via a ""semi-permanent"" currency randomly acquired by killing mobs, and new weapon/scroll drop unlocks via challenges, making the progression feel extremely good compared to most roguelites,
- frequent updates that go in the right way from my point of view,
- a price tag extremely reasonable considering the current content.

Cons:
- platforming feels clunky and could use better collisions and feedback,
- a few bugs, lack of polish and the UI can be improved (early access, fair enough),
- some weapons, scrolls and talents feel underwhelming or too strong, could use more rebalancing,
- lack of a kind of ending.

To conclude, Gunfire Reborn is an already good game in itself that needs a bit of polish to feel finished, but about every aspect of its core screams for more content, and that's a good thing.

If you like Rogue-lite games and shooters this is a fantastic game to try out. If I had to make a comparison it's kinda like Borderlands combined with Binding of Isaac. You can earn permanent unlocks as you play which help make your characters stronger overall, but each playthrough consists of a ""run"" which has you progressing through the floors, finding items and scrolls you equip to make your character stronger. Ending when you either die, or get to the final boss, at which point you'd have to start a new run.

Also the co-op is another strong point of the game, I've played at least 30 hours with my friends and never had an issue with connectivity or lag. The game gets a bit harder on co-op to make up for having another friend to blast through enemies but it feels like there's a good balance regarding the level of difficulty vs solo play.

This game was introduced to me by youtuber solodoublej, and i have not been disappointed... me and my friend (up to 4 players) have been going ham on this game when im home and not working lol.. and its super fun. playing solo just kinda feels like grinding for levels, but still fun to see new things as u go. we play alot all at once and really enjoy it. i think they do a good job at making this game challenging enough to make u want to get past that one part, yet fun enough that makes u want to keep playing even if u lose the round. that being said, its early access, so theres less content than i want there to be... still its not bad at all... there are almost no bugs... like... i dont even think ive seen one. when i first started out playing, my framerate was hitchy, but i havent noticed that in a while... so... on to the bad stuff, which honestly, isnt much. its a random based game and sometimes u get poopied on... but u can still get thru it, and feel fulfilled in the end... more stuff is needed, honestly its worth 12 or 13 bucks... as is rn its worth that. but i would love to see more, maybe different stage selects as there is only one u can choose (and by one i mean u start in one stage and advance to a harder stage after a boss... but u dont get to select any stage at all.)on top of that,, i find myself stiching to one weapon (prism) and my friend sticking to one as well (thunderclap gloves) and this combo seems unbeatable. so balancing may be an issue, but im no game dev. the other guns just dont seem as fun to me so that may be personal opinion. hit boxes are the biggest problem and def need tweaked... i could smack someone in the face point blank and it wouldnt count as a crit... and some hitboxes seem really small. i should be saying crit boxes... bc i have no problem hitting them... at all but sometimes im hitting them in the head and nothing happens... idk y... so hitboxes for crits are my biggest problem... so to break it down:

Pros:
-Super fun overall
-pretty good graphics
-good balance of rewarding and challenging
-great with friends
-few bugs (if any)
-def a 12 or 13 dollar game id prob pay like 20 for it honestly...

Cons:
-crit hit boxes suck
-not a huge amount of content as far as level selection or hero selection
-kinda feels like u only want to use one gun...

72,Gunfire Reborn,73043716,english,"Fantastically fun roguelike shooter. Challenging, yet offers a good sense of progression. Tight, crisp shooter controls and a mix of strategy and reflex combat.

The game feels like an early access game in terms of the amount of content available, but the core gameplay experience is so fun that you quickly become addicted. 

Gameplay - 10/10 - this is where the game shines.

Graphics - 7/10 - the visuals are cartoonish and cel-shaded, light on detail but otherwise stylistically pleasing and streamlined for high performance.

Sound - 6/10 - the music is appropriate and fits the style, but otherwise doesn't particularly stand out. I feel there is room for improvement in this regard. The sound design is, similarly, appropriate and functional, but could be richer and more unique. Many aspects of the sound design are currently missing, from menu & UI sounds, to combat cues that could help the player hear and react to combat situations. Creature and environment sounds are understated and don't particularly stand out in an immersive way. The gun sounds feel like the most polished aspect so far, which is understandable for an early access title that appears to be focused on perfecting the combat experience.

Characters/Story - 3/10 - the character designs are nice, but otherwise there currently isn't much character or story to speak of. The two playable characters don't have vocalizations or dialog to flesh our who they are and why they are shooting their way through dungeons.

Systems - 8/10 - the systems for upgrading, leveling, and choosing skill bonuses are well thought out and meaningfully impact gameplay, though it would be fun to see even more variety in this area.

Level Design - 7/10 - the first 'level' area is pretty basic, comprised of small rooms and tight corridors, but the second level showcases more open arena combat areas and make for a more interesting experience. The third level is similarly more open and interesting.

Weapons - 8/10 - an interesting variety of guns that lend themselves well to different playstyles. The more I play, the more I discover that certain guns I didn't initially like can become very powerful with certain inscriptions or scroll powers. 

All in all, very excited to see where this game goes. It's a lot of fun even in it's current form, and I think it will only get better with new additional content in the form of weapons, levels, characters, and audio design.

73,Gunfire Reborn,73140807,english,"     This game is refreshing. It knows what it is and it seeks to do it well. If you want a game with Dead Cells like progression combined with the hijinks of borderlands elemental and diverse weapon system this is the game for you. Runs of the game are done at around 2 hours if you go all the way through, which is a perfect sit down and play with friends for an afternoon amount of time. It also has a system of permanent progression that can be quite substantial so when you die it is not too frustrating.
    
    It does not suffer any pesky story to get in the way of your projectile mayhem. That being said like borderlands a big fun factor of this game is playing with friends. Runs are varied due to the pickups with a scroll system that vastly can change play style but you will be seeing around the same areas with suble variations every run. Also loot is instanced but if you want to share it with teammates just pick it up and drop it.
     The biggest issue honestly is just that the random matchmaking can be quite unstable if you play with people from faraway and it often randomly groups you together. Another is that if you have a full group of 4, enemies can be a little spongey but that can be easily mitigated with the right build.",1595470909,1595470909,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,395,6,3146,210,2496,1602030450,,

88,Gunfire Reborn,72599190,english,"EDIT:

My initial review was a little harsh, so after playing the game for a while longer I've decided to add onto this a little less harshly.

First, a positive note.

The game is fun for what it is, primarily if you're playing co-op. It has gotten better the longer I've played it. As it stands it has a lot of potential to be a very good game, especially as an early access title. That said, a lot of my initial opinions haven't changed.

- The mobility is a big issue to me. Maybe I'm just spoiled from other games, but the mobility in this game is really lackluster. The dash isn't a dash so much as a slightly larger than normal step in one direction that you can take every three seconds. Mobility scrolls make this a lot better (increased movement speed, triple dash, decreased cooldown), but without it the mobility feels practically useless unless if you time it perfect. It feels particularly useless later on when you're facing ten enemies that each shoot a barrage of homing projectiles while being hounded by other enemies. That said, it would be difficult to buff the current base mobility aside from just adding a small distance increase or cooldown reaction without having to rebalance the previously mentioned mobility scrolls. Honestly, I would suggest just adding in a hero who focuses on mobility, maybe they have double dash in their base kit or something, in exchange for a lower initial HP pool or something to round them out. That way players who still enjoy the current mobility for its difficulty can have it. Just like how the dog character is based on dual-wielding, have this character focus on mobility. Their talents could give them movement speed buffs or give them buffs depending on how much mobility they have (as an example, the scroll that increases your movement speed based on your shield %). Maybe receive a certain amount of damage reduction for a couple seconds after dashing, better shield regen rate based on movement speed (which would synergize with the aforementioned scroll), or passively reload ammo while they're moving. 

- Secondly, the essence not being persistent is extremely jarring. I came into this after playing other roguelites wherein it was normal for you to keep progression currency after each run. It just seems odd to randomly destroy a player's reward at the end of each run if they choose not to spend it, especially if you gamble your essence away on reviving or simply die to a boss before your teammates kill it (you don't get any reward and have to wait to be revived from a peddler for a good chunk of gold). It seems like the devs are trying to counter this by specifically adding in a talent that lets you keep a % of your essence after each run, which just seems weird; taking a base game mechanic from other roguelites and locking it behind progression currency. This should just be one of the initial talents you get if it's not something you simply start with. As it stands the game feels more grindy than it should -- if I die during a run I have to choose between abandoning my run and ruining my enjoyment just so that I can end up with some kind of reward, or gamble my essence away to self-revive and hope I end up with enough essence at the end to get anything - which is rare, because by the time I get to the desert level it costs over half my essence to self-revive. I personally don't find that fun. Don't get me wrong I like difficulty in games, but there's a difference between being challenging and being obnoxious. You could just say ""git gud"" but that's not the point - you're meant to die in roguelites, but gradually become stronger so that you can get further, that's why progression currency is persistent. In this you're encouraged to play great and never die or don't get any progression currency, which doesn't make any sense.

- The revive mechanic doesn't feel great, particularly when you die to a boss in co-op. Your teammate kills it and you get 0 reward. Literally nothing. No weapon, no scroll, no gold, no essence. It doesn't matter how much work you put into killing said boss, you get nothing, and if you previously self-revived you're punished even more. Then you have to wait for your teammate to fight their way through at least one stage in order to find a peddler so that they can spend roughly half their gold to revive you. That's pretty rough, especially when you're playing co-op with just two people but the enemies have tripled HP (and whatever other difficulty buffs they get with multiple players). Players should get revived after a boss is killed or at least make it a talent that people can acquire if they choose. The self-revive feels like more of a gamble than it's worth especially at later stages when, as previously mentioned, self-reviving costs over half your essence which means you're unlikely to get much of any reward once the run is over unless if you manage to beat the next boss.

- The gun disparity is pretty obvious to me. A lot of the guns don't feel very strong, whereas others are ridiculously powerful. It obviously depends a lot on RNG, whether or not you can get good modifiers, but even then there are a handful of guns I would simply never use unless if I had no other choice. The fire sniper rifle and double-shot shotgun, for example, are my two least favorite guns. I was excited to get the sniper rifle at first, until I actually used it. I ended up getting more use out of it by using it like a shotgun and walking up into enemy's faces at pointblank range to shoot them rather than wasting the time to scope in. Maybe I just never end up with a good build or get bad RNG on my sniper rifles, but it never actually feels strong or worth taking over anything else. This is a lot harder to fix because it's so heavily reliant on RNG and I have a feeling the gun disparity won't ever be balanced -- but that's an issue other games have as well.

- The boulder vault rooms are just silly. The boulders are so close proximity and come at such a random rate/position that you're honestly better off just tanking the hits to your shield than wasting the time to try and dodge past them -- which, obviously, shouldn't be the case. The point of traps is to bypass them, not facetank them because they're so obnoxious. The primary issue is that because the game's base mobility is so bad it becomes extra ridiculous trying to dodge between a  one-inch gap through two boulders when your dash is just a glorified sidestep. On the plus side, as much as I dislike how the mobility feels in this game, the jump puzzle vault rooms are ironically my favorite and are actually enjoyable. There's nothing enjoyable about the boulder vault rooms. You could say they're not meant to be enjoyable because it's a challenge room, but since when did difficulty equate to not being fun?

Those are my current primary issues with the game that, to me, are really holding it back from being as good as it could be. It's enjoyable enough to play with a friend, but I don't think I would play it solo in its current state. Maybe others find it fun, but not me.

Would I recommend the game in its current state? I'm still going with no -- I'd wait until the next update, at least. Like I said the game has a lot of potential, but it's also too often more frustrating than it is fun. I was tempted to refund this game myself when I first got it, but I decided to hang on because I do acknowledge the game's potential and hope that my money goes towards making it better.",1594610765,1595269954,FALSE,2,0,0.478260875,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,12,1,4054,0,378,1598142467,1595227722,Thanks for spending time providing us the feedback.

As you level up, and unlock more weapons and scrolls (passive buffs), the game will get easier. The large amount of different weapons is very satisfying, and it is  particularly fun to see a new weapon or scroll you just unlocked drop.

The largest negative is balance. Even with the large variety of weapons, scrolls and inscriptions (weapon attached buffs) some easy to get combinations are way better then just about everything except the rarest of combinations. 

The other main negative is that the elite mode (new game+) is not particularly more difficult than normal. It would be nice to see the difficulty for that scaling up significantly but with higher chances for more and rare inscriptions.

And sometimes I will dodge out of an explosion area and somehow still get hit by it. I've had Nihilation Monks spawn under ground beneath me and it doesn't show the damage area, so I don't know what is hitting me or from where. The hitboxes for enemy weakpoints seem really off. Sometimes it's super easy to hit them and sometimes no matter how hard you try, it won't count shots against them.

Fun gunplay, nice take on the Genre. I've spent fewer hours on more expensive games.
Though there are some things I personally would like to see:

Character customization
at least different colour pallettes
Hats and hair styles
(I'm sure they are planning on adding more characters, but right now 90% of games have 4 identical cats)

A bigger skill tree
The more things I can do to improve my character the better
I'm keener to play a game that has development. (Killing 100 tough and rare enemies in the final stage of the game to unlock a weapon may be development for you, it's not for me)

Less janky platforming

(Maybe) slower progression through ""worlds"" i.e. one or two more levels per world. Some might find this boring, but the levels could be vamped up a bit/a bit more unique.
There is an obvious spike at least in the first world between the last level before the boss and the one before that
These extra levels will also give you the chance to potentially acquire some nicer gear before the first boss.
Sometimes you get there and it's like ""oh, are we here already""(I know experts in the game might not feel this way)

More worlds(but I assume this is in the works, if not it should be!)

45,Gunfire Reborn,70030065,english,"Satisfies the looter shooter borderlands 3 itch for a fraction of the cost of other similar titles. Just how much does it share in common with the big budget release from gearbox? Well the two currently available characters feature active skills that are more or less a 1:1 match of Salvadore's Gunzerker and Maya's Phaselock abilities. The elements of shock, fire and corrosive (i.e. decay) are all present. The game also has some creative ideas all its own! The Crown Prince (the feline Maya expy) can combine the elements of shock, and fire with his own built in corrosive grenade to create the ""fusion elemental effects"" of miasma and explosion that do even more damage than the basic elements. Also just like borderlands your build is going to end up being an interaction between your characters skill point investments (called ascensions in this game), your choice of weapons (there are over 30 all of which are like borderlands legendaries) and your distribution of skill points in the persistent talent tree that is conserved between runs. Enemies include both cannon fodder, elites (some with elemental attributes) and bosses fought in arena environments which spawn them in waves. 

In terms of weaknesses expect a product that is still not fully polished. I found framerate drops would occur regularly without uncapping my frame rate. The localisation is also not complete right now though its adequate. Given the asking price is just 10 USD the value for dollar is huge but this is by no means as massive a title yet. There are just 3 zones so far and while I can't say what's the case with each zone but I know there is just one boss available for zone one.

59,Gunfire Reborn,72939627,english,"For a game that's still in early access and is so cheap this game has so much to offer.   Gunfire is a fps rogue like game with a cell shaded art style that seems to take influence from games like risk of rain 2 and borderlands in order to deliver a very re playable game that despite it's grind never gets old or boring due to the many different weapons and scrolls that change your play style.

Gunfire currently has two playable character's though I expect them to add a few more before the final update. The two we have currently are the cat and the dog. The cat seems to be a very elemental character with two main ability's, one allows him to freeze enemy's for a short amount of time and the other is an explosive that deals toxic damage over time. Though both of these can be massively changed due to items that are picked up each run. The dog also has two ability's. The first is the ability to due whiled for a short period of time and his second is also an explosive though this one deals direct damage to the enemy rather than toxic overt time. 

Another change between the two is the amount of health they have. The cat has less base HP but more shields where as the dog has more base hp and less shields. The different's between the two is that base hp does not recharge over time and shields do.  The cat is unlocked from the start and the dog gets unlocked after getting to level 30. I like to play as the cat more due to him being more flexible in runs though I know people who love to play as the dog and are really good with him so it's more down to personal opinion.  

Visually GF looks pretty good with it's cell shaded art style. Reminds me a bit of some of the older spyro games in it's design, even more so when it comes to the second stage. I also like the design of some of the enemy's who are all easy to spot from and identify from the moment you see them meaning that you can use your best weapon on some of the more difficult enemy types.

Now for the downsides that I think mostly could still be sorted out in early access. The first is a small but still minor annoyance. There does seem to be some odd translations on a few of the things in game. Whilst it's mostly fine there are a few times I was confused about the wording such as one of the items having a description that never told me if the effect happened on me or an enemy or a chest that had a messy option that I only really understood after clicking it.  These are rare to come across but are a bit annoying when you do find them. Another thing I think could be sorted about a bit is the speed some of the enemy's kill you. There have been a few time where I walk into a room with full shields and hp only to be instantly cut down in a fraction of a second by an enemy I haven't even seen yet and this can become a bit annoying if you just had a really good run only to have it ruined by something you don't have time to react to. These is mostly caused by enemy's like the bombers than gang up on you and any enemy that can take down 3/4 of your health in a single hit. Even after becoming powerful in the game these enemy's still felt annoying to come across though I will admit there is nothing more fun that watching them all melt if you had the best possible run. The last problem I have is the second boss. There are three in the game and whilst the first and third bosses are quite good but the seconds is just crazy. The second boss is far more difficult than the final boss. Think of one of the instant kill enemy's and now give them two massive health bars and a beam of damage that can melt your entire hp from full to nothing in less than 2 seconds. Now make it move faster than your base speed and give it a large AOE. That is a real struggle. Though fixing that should be easy, Just make it so when he fires his over powered attack he moves a little bit slower than the base speed of your character so he can plan for it and move out of the way.

Over all those for what it costs GF reborn is an amazing game that already feels more polished in Earl Access than many finished games do and I can't wait for more updates to this amazing rouge like game.",1595150277,1595150277,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,359,93,2293,30,1872,1601568408,,

16,Gunfire Reborn,72882733,english,"This game is really fun, I can't think of any major flaws. The only annoyance is that in the early game, any XP you have remaining will be wasted until you unlock the perk to let some amount of XP carry over. Every weapon is usable and fun, and only 2-3 weapons are clunky or bad. 

The synergies that are possible can absolutely make you delightfully broken. Sometimes I will slog through the first boss that takes 5+ minutes (not often, however) but other times I will melt him because I got really lucky. 

Also the game is very RNG and numbers based. No garbage 'increase your damage by 1.3% on a tuesday if you're wearing red' nonsense, you can very easily stack multiple 'increase your damage by 30-50%' effects and that rules.

Finally, this game is full 3D (as the screenshots and trailer show) which is fucking absurd at this price point. That is to say, this game doesn't cost enough for the level of quality on display. The low-poly look adds a charm to things and the animations are detailed enough that the low-poly look doesn't feel like a cop-out at all. 

Get this game, lots of replay value, good polish, CATHARTIC. If the core gameplay loop appeals to you, you will very easily put 50-100 hours plus into a $12 game. 

I hope they add more levels. Like maybe another stage into the base game for free, and then another several as an expansion/DLC for which I will gladly pay another $12 for.",1595059295,1595059295,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,273,2,5479,124,1840,1601392559,,

20,Gunfire Reborn,72879343,english,"I've played lots of Rougelites and similar RPG-like single player games: Dead cells, Transistor, Risk of Rain, Hades, Enter the Gungeon, Wizard of Legend, Moonlighter, etc. 

There's three main parts of roguelites: The rpg powers, the gameplay (aka how do you survive?), and variety (aka replayability).

a) The rpg powers are varied and sufficient. Lots of roguelites get this pretty good to be fair. The system in this game is closest to Deadcells out of all the games I've played. Basically, you have 2 weapons, a hero power, and a grenade power. The weapons have random bonuses and the weapons can be leveled up. There's synergy possible as well, that results in powerful weapon effects, like Dead cells.

The power leveling is more akin to Hades. You can pick from 3 paths and each power up affects one of those three (grenade, element dmg, hero power). 

b) Gameplay/survival

So most rouglites are platformers or top-down view. Gameplay-wise, this almost always results in kiting back (i.e. running away) as necessary at high levels. And aim/mechanics don't come into play because frankly you don't need precision aim with top-down games. So the result is just kite back over and over and over. I really find that annoying in Diablo and bullet hell games. Just avoid...

In this game, you still must avoid dmg, duh. But for you fps gamers, hitting crit shots is really important, combined with movement. If you like fast moving fps games like Destiny or Titanfall, you will like the shooting in this game. If you come from CSGO, you will also enjoy but obviously you know that R6 and CSGO are unique games.

In summary, SELECTIVE offense is your best defense here. Relying on skill synergy and prioritizing enemy types, with good aim headshots and avoiding AOE dmg is key. 

c) Replayability

Probably the weakest point of the game. I would say it's in early access but that's no excuse. Never ever assume that a game will be different once it's ""out of early access"". That's coming from a Dayz player. People who say ""stop complaining it's early access"" are fanboys. 

There needs to be additional levels made, it's that simple. But it's scaled so you won't be able to get to the end right away. You probably need to be level 50 and unlock the whole skill tree. 

Also the difference between levels IS big. The first level is a dungeon all close quarters. The 2nd is a desert and you need a sniper or long range weapons. Lots of AOE. You can snipe enemies from super far. 

So the base is there, but there's only 3 levels now.

CONCLUSION: A total steal for $10. Probably should be $15 but that extra $5 difference definitely made me buy it NOW compared to waiting for a 30% sale. So whoever was the marketer for this game I give you props for that decision.",1595053093,1595053093,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,784,50,1009,0,443,1599922091,,

Very interesting implementations of Vaults for extra optional content to beef up for the boss fight.  Roguelite system is excellent.  As you level and invest talents the path to that first boss gets quicker and quicker.  The difficulty ramps up in a FUN way as you increase player count.  The boss is definitely easier to solo than he was in a party of 4.  I CANNOT WAIT to see the final release of this product.  It's already a better investment than Fallout 76 or Borderlands 3 were.

To start off, I don't really LOVE first person shooters, but for some reason the game + the artwork is a reason why I keep coming back. Honestly Gunfire Reborn is a chill rougue-lite shooter that brings me back memories of Borderlands 2 and grinding for loot and gun stats.

With friends it offers a similar experience to solo, except better. You get more loot, enemies scale so it is little bit more challenging, but with a team that refines their gun stats and finds OP scrolls, it won't be much of a struggle. 

Something about crit-hitting the enemies and running around and dashing is just so refreshing. I play spotify and listen to chill songs, almost like lofi and just vibe. its a huge stress reliever and  I enjoyed every mechanic of the game. 

With more content being added soon, I cannot wait for possible more classes, more stage/levels, more bosses, guns, scrolls, etc! It feels like such a great game compacted into three main areas (each with 3-4+ stages), and when they add the updates, it will for sure be my most played!

***Unfortunetly had to change my review to negative due to the first boss having some very broken and unfun mechanics. Massive bullet sponge, Broken hit detection, and infinetly spawning ads when you play Co-op. So far the game is fun, until you get to a boss.

Feels very grindy. Some enemies in the second area have so much health that you just can't deal with them fast enough before you get overwhelmed so you have to keep grinding the first act over and over to get upgrades which just isn't that fun.

Pros:
-""one more run"" is alive and well
-Good variety of guns so far
-guns feel punchy and fun
- enough content right now for the current price

Cons:
-The same levels in a row everytime gets boring.
- difficulty (will be a turn off for some)
-environents are a little stale and uninspired.
- Many builds but seems like only a select few will get you through past tougher areas.
- A little too focuses on the run grind (using crystals to increase shields, health, and cooldowns to make it easier) instead of natually getting better to progress farther.

Allow me to state this, I am trash at all FPS games I play. Which usually causes me to just not play them after a while. This, however, is different. Even with the short amount of time I've played, I can feel myself improving. As a person who sucks at shooters, that makes me feel like this is a different breed of game. While it's PvE, I still feel myself improving with my tracking and snapping to targets. 

That being said though, this game isn't without it's flaws. Right now with it only being one set of bosses with different level themes after each boss, it can and will get same-y, but I imagine that as dev goes on, this game will continue to improve.

It might not be THE replacement since there's still content to come and feels dry in that sense but it does a great job of being a good rogue-like game. While you only get to play two characters at the time of writing this, there are tons of unlockables and weapons to experiment with that are wacky and powerful, such as elemental damage, instant kill and extreme rate of fire (Hopefully they add more weapons in future updates since there are only 41 at the moment). At the end of a run, you'll earn Soul Essence which allows you to upgrade your ""talents"", which are permanent upgrades to your runs that'll make you stronger and provide runs with more spammability, for lack of a better word. I'm the type of player who enjoys a run and gun play style and brushing through enemies so if that's how you want to play, this game will definitely supply. 
The graphics aren't anything to rave about. However, if you played the Sly Cooper games on Playstation, you'll easily be able to tell that the art style is similar to those games which I personally enjoy. Do note that if you try to run this game without v-sync, your game is prone to crashing easily (Currently using a 144hz monitor). Turning v-sync on will avoid that, but your move may vary.
Multiplayer is peer-to-peer in this game so if your internet sucks, your teammates will have a bad time and probably want to leave. In otherwords, get better internet nerd. My experience with multiplayer was great so far in that players were extremely cooperative and there's no toxicity in the player-base(yet). Most people have mics but never really use them though.
Overall, this game is worth giving a try. The only sale I've seen was this past(2020)summer sale with a 12% off.

The gun play is similar to borderlands with the element matching aspect and there is a decent variety of weapons so far. The roguelite aspect reminds me of Enter the Gungeon for the item unlock system and Rogue Legacy for the skill tree system. I feel like both systems are implemented well so far. 

The only real cons are character/gun variety but I feel like that will come eventually. I haven't made it far enough to know if the game will just wrap like Risk of Rain 2 and scale or if after the 3rd Boss I'll be done with game so length could potentially be a con.

The multiplayer aspect is a strong selling point as it is much more enjoyable to team up with friends and do a run or two.

The few issues I have are related to the platforming and time commitment. If you like jump puzzles and platforming type games this will either be great or terrible for you because it is a bit floaty with how the character moves in the air, making jumps harder to control. Practice definitely helps, but it is still frustrating to slip off of stuff when you think you are on it. The time commitment issue is a run of the current levels can take upwards of 2 hours from my experience and it may be an issue for some groups where people don't have that time available.

96,Gunfire Reborn,72623391,english,"This game... is an anomaly. Not in the fact that its hard to describe what it is, which is a FPS rogue-lite, but in the fact that I've spent so much time in the game in two weeks despite the fact that the amount of content it has shouldn't be keeping my attention for as long as it is, to the point that I'm honestly trying to speedrun the game. 
           Now, lets start with the basic loop of the game in to set the scene. Which, like pretty much all rogue-lite games revolves around killing enemies, getting weapons with randomized added effects to it, obtaining power boosts or items that changes your playstyle, getting as far as possible, with beating the final boss being the end goal, and when that loop completes you spend all of the special currency that drops in low quantities throughout the game to give your character small buffs and quality of life improvements that add up overtime that turn your character from a little baby man into a Giga Chad. 
     And with that, we can get on to the actual review. 
                       First, the bad, which are few, thankfully. Besides some balance issues with some guns being blatantly useless, overpowered, and some being uninspired, plus quite a few scrolls and inscriptions being much more hindrances rather than side-grades or playstyle changes like I assume their for; The main issue with Gunfire Reborn is that their is just not enough of it. And don't take it as ""Oh the game is unfinished,"" or something like that. I mean that its simply impossible to enjoy this game as much as it should, and the general additions that many rogue-lites and rogue-likes have such as looping the same stages as before but with stronger enemies, or more stages and playable characters is woefully absent. Seriously, if the devs just added 2 more stages/areas and the ability to loop your run then this game would easily be up their along with Risk of Rain 2 or Slay The Spire for me.
                   Now, lets get on to the good. First of all, the gunplay is just amazing. the sound all of the guns make barring a few exceptions(Rainbow Arch) and the sound it makes when you land a critical hit can only be described as "" killer, dude."" Second, the game is polished as Fuq. Not only for an early access game, but for an independent title made by obscure developed the amount of polish in this game is outright disgusting and puts many of the initial and even current quality early access games to shame. Third, the artstyle is, in a word *pop* Noice. The Cell-shaded artstyle and Chinese aesthetic work phenomenally well with the feel of the game. And Fourth, its just a fun and addicting game in all the right ways, I don't really have much else to really add besides that.
          In Short, buy this game. Its well worth the price, the problems with it are simply that you can't enjoy it as much as you would like to, and gahd-DAMN that doggo is THICC.",1594651051,1594651366,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,82,1,2815,0,2526,1597930169,,

Great Game for $12
Plenty of replayability
Just as good with friends
Cons : 
Netcode seems to be off. Boss and enemy animations seem to cut short especially for multiplayer. This is very noticeable in trap rooms with boulders too.
Many optimization issues. Too many deaths due to the game just stopping on a single frame and you have no idea how it happened. The game will get stuck on a frame, then you're hit with game over after 2-3 seconds. This needs to be fixed fast since it can make the game unplayable in the last zones where tons of enemies and particle FX can cause this issue. I can run AAA games just fine at 60fps. This issue is pretty much what makes me not want to play the game for hours on end since you know your run will pretty much end to bullshit. 

Still a good game overall.

If they push purchasable content the game will fail. If they update the base game it should do well.

Cons:
- First issue is probably the most important. This game does care about you learning how to play it. There are text boxes, sometimes, but there are complex mechanics everywhere in this game, and the game doesn't give a damn about teaching them to you.
- This game feels locked behind lots of grinding. Which is just super frustrating and annoying. 
- Not a lot of options how to play the game, it feels like. Only 2 characters, a handful of weapons (but you'll quickly find most of them don't really work for ones playstyle. I personally come back to the same ~5 weapons over and over), and a handful of scrolls that effect the game in a meaningful way.

Pros:
- Great artstyle
- Gameplay is, in general, fun and addicting
- Good use of talent trees, even if grindy
- Good variety in enemies, maps, and challenges
- Lots of content that slowly (through grinding) gets unlocked. Should be able to give you ~50 hours of content, I'd think.

For an early access game (7/12/2020) it is surprisingly polished and smooth.

86,Gunfire Reborn,72562259,english,"Gunfire Reborn is the lovechild of Risk of Rain 2 and Borderlands infused with a heavy dose of stylization that can only be described as Okami but Chinese with a heavy dose of chibi.

Gunplay is pretty standard, most weapons are projectiles but a good chunk of them have projectile speed fast enough to feel reasonably close to hitscan at close range, and as a result only really deterring the freshest of newcomers from taking longer shots, not to mention the weapons that are -actually- hitscan. The sound and visual design is what really helps sell this here, as the variance in weapons is closer to the first Borderlands, which felt like it was full of guns that happened to be slightly magic, than it does to the rest of the series which could fire pretty much anything out of a barrel for the sake of a joke or a shock to the player. This gives the game a more gritty dungeon crawler feel while still being darkly cute in its more blatant aesthetic.

Enemy variance is a little less interesting than you might think, you'll be dealing with melee guys, relatively low hp crawlers, grenade guys, tall skinny snipers, and heavies with either shields or close range high damage weaponry. The affix system ripped straight from Diablo III helps quite a bit here, as do some minor changes in how you have to interact with the enemies depending on how far into your run you are; the crawlers in area 2 are a lot larger and more powerful, but their size means their additional HP is basically worthless. The heavies from area 1 to area 2 become absolutely devastating, as they go from being large horse statues that mostly serve to annoy you in the middle of a fight to being large scary Roadhog lookalikes with flamethrowers that will nuke an unsuspecting player in the midst of a sniper duel.

Level design isn't necessarily exceptional but there's enough verticality and variance to room shape where I don't mind that I'm fighting in the same rooms a lot of the time. It helps that many rooms/chunks are locked to specific areas, which gives me hope for more rooms added down the line as more weapons are added and need to be accounted for. My only real complaint here is that the challenge rooms are very samey, especially the platforming sections. Platforming sections which require perfect dash and jump placement/timing, otherwise you have to start entirely over again, which turns to frustration quickly on even the shortest sections. We need more variance here, and we need some of these sections to have added hazards and more forgiving platform spacing. Less boulder rooms as they aren't difficult, they're only boring.

Weapon inscriptions, much like red text in Borderlands or any text in Diablo, add small bonuses to your weapon that can change  how you play and how viable your weapon is. This is great until you realize that you can only upgrade your weapon's damage, you can't change, buy, or affix further inscriptions. This can make finding your favorite gun early in a run  disappointing and depressing rather than exciting like it would be in a game like Synthetik: Legion Rising.

Overall, combat feels really good and even though I only bought this 2 or 3 days ago it's quickly become one of my favorite roguelites/roguelikes of all time. I hope that the characters get added with more interesting abilities and that maybe you get more options to what your dash ability can be as you level up. I hope that more guns that resemble Borderlands 1 get added, kinda like the Star Devourer or Concealed Ammo or Piercing Flame. The dev team would do well to skew damage scaling away from straight number-walling like Risk of Rain 2 as there is no organic leveling system, and skew it more towards interesting stacking with damage over time elemental effects like Borderlands or even Immortal Redneck, a game which clearly shares a lot in common with Gunfire Reborn.",1594559400,1594559525,TRUE,1,0,0.519999981,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,1922,28,994,0,612,1600211102,,

You like shootin' stuff?
You like lootin' stuff?

Then do not buy this game if you don't want to do anything else 'cause this game is addicting.

Even though, it's still in early access you can feel how well polished it is.

The combat feels amazing, it's fun shooting around with your guns. The feedback is great, the guns sound well, headshots sound different, the movement is responsive, all the tiny details have been taken care of. The enemies are also varied and make you prioritize some or change your strategy, which makes the combat so satisfying. And then there are 50 guns or so, which all feel different. This is a shooter well done.

The roguelike part of the game is also good. The RNG is balanced. You can beat the game just with the standard gun if you're really good and that's because of the solid shooter base this game has. Heck yeah, I almost beat the game only using my energy orb.

In the end, the randomness spices up the already solid gameplay. The game can feel a bit grindy, though. But once they add more heroes it should be better. It's still in early access. I mean some released games feel less finished than this one. It's also not an easy game, but you can always read a boss guide when you're stuck.

5,Gunfire Reborn,72548405,english,"I've only played 4h so far but I'm having a blast.

A Rogue-lite FPS with permanent upgrades similar to Rogue Legacy (+x% to damage, +y% money gained and such). The upgrades give a nice small goal to chase but aren't some must-have +100% damage or such.
There's different weapons you can find, think similar to an arena shooter. You basically find different weapon archetypes (not like in Borderlands where there's several dozen of each archetype). There's a burst rifle, a rocket launcher, a sniper, etc. Those weapons have random rolls on them (think Diablo or Borderlands) like more reload speed, bigger clip size and such and can be upgraded (like in many MMOs) to +1, +2, +3, etc. to increase their stats. There's also elements that work exactly like in Borderlands (fire is good against normal health, shock against shields, corrosive against armor). The mixture of the upgrade level, random rolls and elements give enough variety and force you to make some tough choices. Do you keep your favorite weapon which is rather weak or go for a super well rolled rocket launcher?
The weapons you find and some other ugprades will only last for the current run but they can be a pretty nice damage/defense increase while the permanent upgrades are smaller (like 5% more health).
The jump'n'run rooms are also a nice change of pace that will give you some bonus loot for the run.

Multiplayer was fine, didn't notice any problems so far. The built-in voice chat is surprisingly usable. It's not as good as something like Discord, but it's probably among the best in-game voice chats I've used. There is just a little bit too much gain on microphones so they peak when someone gets... too excited ;)

The game is in early access but I'd already consider this fully playable. Probably more polished than some games are at release these days.

I only have very few and minor negative points about this game so far:
* The music stops in the post-game screens which just feels weird
* When you're in the menu, the music auto-ducks when you speak (music gets more quiet). Nice in theory but in practice it's more annoying and it should active when OTHERS speak, not you
* I had one bug where there was one UI element on top of another, thus blocking it. Walking away and back fixed it, so really not a problem
* During loading screens the voice chat is not really usable. You can technically use it, but the others will probably only catch a fraction of what you're saying

None of these are really a big problem and since the game is still very frequently being updated, I expect those to change soon. More content also seems to be in the work, though I personally don't like buying games based on future promises. Fortunately the game is already very fun to play right now.

This game sees continuous updates and the attention the developers are putting towards this game are amazingly positive.  Currently there are two characters to choose from, a cat or dog.  You'll play through 3 different worlds with multiple stages in each.  Fight enemies using a variety of weapons while choosing the right one for the task at hand.  The bosses you'll face at the end of each are varied enough to ensure each are offering a different experience.

As you play you earn soul shards which you can use to upgrade your character and perks.  The higher your level, the more perks.  The more perks, the easier it is to stay alive and the better your weapons will be.  

You can play solo, and that's fine.  But it excels when you're playing with other people.  With friends is great, but the matchmaking system is very good so you'll almost always find a group to play with in under a minute.

But this game.. is okay. Its one of the rare FPS games that does not make me dizzy.

The game is a PvE coop game, which I do recommend playing with your friends rather than solo. Just buy multiple copies of this game and gift it to your friends. You'll have lots of fun.

You can also play with randoms via matchmaking, but I only managed to find games once. and if you're new, you'll be waaaaaay underlevelled that you might as well play a private game with your friends and have a good ping.

the AI is a fun challenge. They still behave predictably like an AI, but they have these unique moves that you have to learn to hit them effectively. Some enemies likes to jump a lot and others like to shoot you with large projectiles.

The main complaint at the moment was the bosses. Some of the bosses have insanely high HP when played multiplayer. Heck, the four of us can't even deplete the bosses' shield, let alone his actual HP. I'm okay with the bosses have his HP multiplied according to the number of players, but don't buff his shield too much :D

Also, why is the cost of reviving characters is so expensive (from stage 2 onwards) ? 
We've already have problem with the short timespan for your teammates to revive you.
Which basically means, if you die in the middle of a warzone, there is no way your teammates can beat the stage or beat the boss.

at least either reduce the cost to revive,
or increase the time to revive your teammates
or even better, allow your teammates to be revived for free prior to boss fight.

and also, I hope there is also a stage select so that not every time we have to start from the first stage.

This game is still in early access, and it does look promising.
hopefully the developers will continue supporting this game with more stages to play.
I'm hoping that we get at least 2 more characters - as playing with 3 - 4 cats with same skin and color palette is pretty meh.",1594486083,1594486083,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,182,16,503,0,457,1598459597,,

15,Gunfire Reborn,72465445,english,"I bought this on a whim after watching Northernlion try it, and was immediately put off by the difficulty. I’m relieved I gave it a second chance because it’s extraordinary.

The movement is crisp and responsive, letting you bounce around the environments just a few feet ahead of enemy fire. The enemy pool may not be massive,  but it’s roster of baddies all play off each other to create an interesting flow of combat.

The difficulty is balanced on a razors edge, and as I learn new build possibilities (of which there are MANY for each character), weapons I had discarded as trash have come back around to become amazing, like the Prism in a crit build or the Infinite ammo Big Hippo dual wield build. Multiplayer is significantly more difficult then single player, even when just upped to a duo. So far I managed to clear the game solo, and I’ve reached stage 3 but not completed the boss in multiplayer.

There’s one thing worth noting that detracts from the fun. The occasional unbelievably tanky unit that got defender and healing modifiers. I’d rather have a unit do more damage or run faster then an enemy that is easy to dodge on it’s own that simply takes 3 minutes to kill due to whatever reason. 

That being said, I haven’t had this much fun in a roguelite since Enter the Gungeon and am happy to see this enter the ranks. So far, the grind to get good enough and face that third boss is the most entertainment I’ve had from any game in a while.

9/10 current, but I truly believe if they keep adding to content to this game that it will be 10/10. I can see myself playing this game for years to come.

50,Gunfire Reborn,72434747,english,"The concept of the game is very simple which is basically you launch an instance (a run) and just shoot your way through 3 zones (each zone has multiple levels) and beat 3 bosses to complete your run.

[list]
    [*]There are current 2 heroes as of writing
    [*]There are a lot of guns and every gun dropped during a run has random attributes
    [*]Scrolls are available as well which add properties to your run (+move speed)
    [*]Additionally there's upgrades per level you complete to your current run
    [*]Outside of the run/instance you have a upgrade tree that is permanent
    [*]Two difficulties (normal and elite)
[/list]

Now the game is good for what it is worth I think everyone into some mindless shooter should buy this and just click some heads. What I will be doing here is critiquing the game even though I very much enjoy it, I think it could be much better.

So the first thing is the [b]heroes[/b].

What we see here is two heroes that share similar traits, they have dash and grenades. The only difference between the two is one heroes special skill is dual wielding and the other one throws a bomb that locks enemies in their position for some time.

From what it seems because dash seems to be a focus on level design and what concerns me is whether other heroes are just going to all have dash and variation of 2 skills or 1 skill plus different grenades.

I've played both heroes and frankly the primary skill is pretty much bound to a key I will never press because you don't need it. I think all 3 skills should be varied uniquely for the heroes.

For level design which is primarily the special levels you find, you can focus on level design for one hero with dash or movement speed to complete them (like dash button can be increase movement speed for some) and then other heroes that may have different speed, no dash or so can complete special levels differently depending on their unique skills.

This also applies for scrolls, so some scrolls apply to all or a subset of heroes while others are unique to them.

Like I'd say if the future heroes (if any) are to come and they all dash, they all throw a grenade but they just have one skill that is virtually unique, that's just samey-hero implementation from my point of view. I've got ideas like a hero should be able to charge their shield (while the shield is not rechargeable but they get twice the shield) and they get to teleport around the map (instead of dashing)

The second thing is [b]difficulty[/b].

The reality is, normal mode is harder than elite mode because you obviously don't have the upgrades (out of the instance) to support a stronger build so often you'll lose till you unlock things that really help in terms of say increasing health and damage. The other thing is, this but 5 of them are shared for all heroes.

Once you finish the game once, elite mode is available.

In elite mode you have a lot of supporting scrolls, immensely more coins and drops. It makes the game very easy because often you become overpowered.

Which isn't a bad thing because games like Slay the Spire, Monster Train and Risk of Rain 2 get to this point where you want to feel overpowered and just wipe ass sometimes.

So in terms of difficulty I'm not asking for the easy raise HP and damage, that's the lazy way out and that's called artificial difficulty. What I'd like to see is more ideas on traps because traps are a good way to implement difficult or change the event of a game.

For example, a flash bang trap would be kind of cool, white out the screen like a CS:GO flash if you stepped on the trap and didn't turn away in time. Then you have to have some memory of the map layout to jump your way back. 

At this point I think elite mode health and damage is in a good place. It just seems too easy to become overpowered but I also don't want this going away, I think a good balance is a 35-65 in being overpowered vs overwhelmed in elite difficulty.

The third thing is the [b]AI and shooting mechanics[/b]

There appears to be a hit reg issue, I've been noticing it not hitting and there's also issues with the AI getting stuck or not being aggressive.

In fact I think aggressive AI would increase difficulty more especially if you varied the way AI behaved because right now nothing poses a major threat if you just keep moving and kiting. The only one I am afraid of is that big blue thing that hooks you.

That is great implementation.

There's also weak spots that I think should be different per unit too, so far it's just headshots.

Finally I'll put some [b]positive feels[/b]

For the money spent, I played this for nearly 40 hours and will enjoy any content that comes. It's really chill to play. Now I don't know the road map but this game has got my moneys worth.

Let me just put this out there, Borderlands 3 was boring, for a game about shooters and story, the game was just mechanically boring. This game was more fun than Borderlands 3. I literally put more hours in this than I did BL3 because I had to quit since it was so boring.

A couple of critical mistakes I think were made that make this a bit of a ho hum title.  The theme is just all over the place.  It's a mystical ancient Asia vibe, but very generic and kind of lack luster.  Then the characters, which are...animals?  I guess?  But they have guns, kind of.  Magic guns maybe?  I dunno, I'm not really given much to work with on that front.  Enemies are some kind of golem things, which is fine.  Works well enough.  My biggest problem is that there's just nothing to latch onto.  The theme could work, and really well, they just haven't given me any reason to care about it.  No gameplay tie ins, just the playground we are sent into.  It really doesn't make a lot of sense to me and there's just nothing about it that I can resonate with.

88,Gunfire Reborn,72392454,english,"I've been craving a game like this for YEARS. This game is a first person rogue-like shooter that is a fusion of borderlands and risk of rain 2. The gun effect variety still could use some improvement- but the game is still early in it's development and the developer has stated himself that he hopes to add more abilities, scrolls, weapons (of which there are already many), and more weapon effects- so it's not likely to be an issue for too much longer.

The gameplay is incredibly addicting, when you first start leveling your character making it beyond the first series of dungeons (and especially the first ""boss"") can be difficult- especially when you factor in the RNG of getting an exceptional weapon or scroll, but that all builds into the charm of the game. In my 13 hours played I have managed to reach level 45 and have nearly beat the third of four currently existing dungeons- I'm not sure what happens beyond that given the difficulty of the boss fights. In addition to dungeon sweeping there are little portals that provide additional challenges in the form of mini-boss rooms and platforming challenges that are quite fun. The gun's feel great- though I'm still not a big fan of a couple of the existing weapons and hope they are further balanced in the future to make them more useful (looking at you cavalry), but as of the latest patch those balances are already coming across.

All in all I can't recommend this game enough. Whether you intend to play with yourself, 3 other friends, or just utilize the online matchmaking- the game is simply an incredible experience and easily worthy of it's price of $11 (honestly, having played it I feel its worth at least $29.99 even in it's current form).

Guns are well thought out from a design point of view, and the developers have been making nice adjustments for the weaker weapons to make them feel better. It feels like there's a flavor for everyone and the Occult Scrolls and Ascension Tree really help augment how powerful your weapons feel.

Excited to see them add more randomness and depth to the stage levels but otherwise the layouts are pretty standard at the moment. Although at the time of this review it is still currently Early Access and they have stated that this is something they are working on!

Progression system is enjoyable and each point in the talent system feels impactful. The only criticism I have of it from playing is how slow it feels to start. It takes several hours and a handful of runs to start getting the ball going in terms of levels and unlocking guns and whatnot. After you hit level 30 the power curve starts feeling much better but it does feel almost like a wall in a way until you level up enough. I'm concerned it may impact how a new player would feel about the game since they may just feel like it's impossible and never get to the point where they can have fun.

Overall, I think this game is phenomenal and I have a lot of fun each run!

A lot of the weapons are comfortable to play with and can always switch up gameplay with different combinations of weapons in your current arsenal. And as every upgrade and perk are randomised, every run can play out differently.

There's also quite a bit of replayability too, especially with the unlockable weapons/perks. When you unlock them, the enemy you kill afterwards always drops that unlocked weapon/perks, giving you a chance to try it out and see how it functions. Even when I fail a run, I still get the satisfaction that I unlocked something in that run.

I still have quite a bit of the game to go through (I'm only around Level 26 or so by the time I've posted this review) but if you have the chance to, pick this up if you like Roguelite FPS games, you won't regret it. The game is still in early access, so expect more and more content to come.

Soon, i'll have to kill the first boss consistently if i want to upgrade. It's slightly annoying, but i understand how they want progression to go.

41,Gunfire Reborn,72343407,english,"TLDR:
Expect to repeat the same ridiculously easy content over and over again, just to make it to the weirdly difficult and tedious boss fight, die, and start over. 

I want to like the game, but in its current state, it is more frustrating than fun, at least for solo play. Combat is like playing borderlands, except you can only walk, and your dodge is short, single-use, and has a cool-down.

For the random mob encounters, this isn't a problem. Some people call it ""rogue-like"" and you can play it that way, I suppose, except mobs can see you through walls, and will fire endlessly at that wall, like it isn't there/. Still, I was having fun taking out the random mobs and finding gear to improve. 

However, this all changes for the very first boss fight. You walk into an open arena with some big monster-dude remote-AOE-slamming the ground beneath your feet, trying to jump on your head, and throwing attacks at you from afar. 

The fight takes multiple rounds, requires timed dodges that get more difficult each round, is way too long, and is overall unforgiving.  To add to the fun (frustration) your character moves horribly slow and your dodge, which is crucial for survival, is single-use and on a long cool-down. Seriously, it makes no sense to have the very first boss fight be so tedious and difficult. 

To the Devs, I would recommend...

- Adding a few health pick-ups during long boss fights
- Reducing the radius of the boss's attacks OR increase the dodge distance/speed of the player
- Allowing for 2 dodges before going on cool-down (like DOOM)
- Increase the player's speed by 25%-50% overall
- How about making the very first boss fight a little less of a PITA?

I will try the game again later, or maybe co-op. I have heard coop is easier compared to playing solo. If things improve I'll revise my review :/.

1. Use Shift to dash timely and carefully. When you see the alert zone, you should move outside of it with dash immediately. 
2. You can hide behind those pillars to avoid some attacks.
 3. You can easily break the shield of Boss with lightning damage weapons. After that, you can use fire damage weapons to kill Boss easily.
 4. You can try to play with your friends, so you can be revived even though you are knocked down. In addition, you can upgrade your defensive talent. Thanks!"

Very early access though, environments are barren, UI is extremely basic, and the English is incredibly broken, making simple item descriptions difficult to understand sometimes, but I expect these to be improved. 

The main issue for me is the main progression system, which they really need to change IMO.  Losing ""unused"" points between rounds is really frustrating, when let's say the cheapest available upgrade costs 30 points, then the 29 points I gathered that run will be useless, making the run essentially a waste of time.

Dead Cells got it right: the upgrades/items needed more points, but even if you only collected 5 points that run, you could still pour that into an ability's unlock bar, meaning you still progressed, even if only a little.

I do like early access but compared to most recent releases i have purchased none of them have felt as ""bare bones"" as this game. I played 20 mins and enjoyed the gun feel but the presentation looks worse than most early access games I've played. It's similar to that FPS roguelike based around pyramids (cowboy something?) and also Ziggurat...but they are getting old now and they still look a lot better than this game...a lot better!!

It's got potential but i've gotta be honest...the first impressions were very quick and immediate: ""This game is not ready yet...and feels so damn empty and lacking in almost every aspect!"" When played after Hades, Curse of the... and even indies like Noita...it just feels like i need to give it more time in the oven...

The UI and overall presentation though need some serious attention!! The graphics are not that important in a game like this but when the art direction is so bland it means the lack of textures and decent lighting make it feel like a tech demo...not a game!!

The cat specializes in elemental damage, which deals extra damage to certain health types. They have a grenade that spews corrosion gas, which inflicts more damage to yellow health. They also have an ultimate ability that deals damage and stuns enemies. Then, there is the dog who survives less easy, but specializes in damage. They have a grenade that explodes on impact for heavy damage. They also have an ultimate ability that lets you use both of your weapons and fire them at the same time.

  Speaking of Weapons, the weapons are very diverse, having some deal having amount of damage, some having big explosions, and others dealing massive damage with elemental damage. 

  Being a Rougelite, you will go through randomly generated levels, and when you die go back to the start of the game.... wellll not exactly, through the game, you get soul essense which you can use on getting permanent upgrades.

41,Gunfire Reborn,72249457,english,"Gunfire Reborn is a first person Rogue shoot em up which is unlike any dungeon crawler I have ever played.
The game has 5 rooms on each level. 4 have normal enemies and 1 has a boss fight.
As you progress through the level you get dropped weapons and item boosters that can help you when at the final fight.
The game reminds me of dungeon defenders but with guns and siege weapons and more of a Battleborn finish to it, which is a good thing.

BE WARNED: This game is immensely hard, especially when first starting out. You WILL die over and over again, but you wont mind as each time you feel like youve achieved something, for when you die you can use essence points to permanently upgrade your chosen character, in return making the next run slightly easier.

The boss fight that ive got to currently is challenging but feels well executed and doesnt suffer from some of the other tropes that bosses in other games have. (invincibility phases, impossible to dodge AOE moves etc.)

The co-op aspect works really well although it would have been nice to have dedicated servers.

Their is no real story to this game but I guess thats to be expected for a game that costs less than £10

The guns all feel unique and each one has a purpose in combat. Sometimes you will get to a final fight and realise you dont have the correct weaponry for the job which makes you change up the way you play and causes you to think smarter about how to approach certain scenarios.

Overall GR is a shining example of a simple, but effective early-access title that respects the playerbase its aimed at and provides fun and ever-changing games.

71,Gunfire Reborn,72226268,english,"So having played this game for 20 hours thus far, I want to give my initial impressions.

Gameplay: 
This game is buttery smooth when playing and the shooting feels incredibly satisfying, I'm not going to make the same comparison others have saying its a mix of Borderlands and (insert game here), because its not in my eyes. The only real comparison to Borderlands is the cel-shaded art style and damage numbers above enemies... That's the only real comparison. This isnt a loot grinding game, you don't keep any of the loot you get on a run apart from what is essentially XP to level your character and unlock new perks.

If you're unsure of this game think of it as Slay the Spire: FPS Edition. You continuously get power ups throughout the game making certain aspects of you stronger and sometimes weaker, you have to carefully select which different scrolls you pick up to maximise your damage and make it through a level.
Selecting which guns you use isn't something to give much thought in the early stages, but later down the line you NEED to in order to progress and take down the tougher enemies in quick fashion.

Graphics: 
The games minimal but clean cel-shaded style is beautiful :)

Performance: 
This differs from PC to PC on any game but for me it ran flawlessly with no hiccups or a single crash thus far, great optimisation.

Pros: 
Co-op upto 4 players.
Looks and runs great.
Can be good for the strategically minded.
Addictive gameplay loop(for the most part, read on).
Cheap.

Cons:
The maps change layout each time but you will see the same rooms again and again, can be repetitive.
Difficulty spikes can throw some players off.",1594124111,1594124111,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,268,10,1270,0,1252,1595840217,,

12,Gunfire Reborn,72190290,english,"Boy oh boy, where to begin with this gem. I'm closing in on the good 5 hour mark and I'm already 10 levels away from the secondary character, doggy boy gunzerker.

Pros:
>Lots of replayability, with semi-random levels

>Weapons. Hoo boy, lots of weapons

>More weapon drops based on what you do

>4 player co-op

>No need to worry about your friends stealing all your loot, it's individually rolled. You'll get a different weapon than your friends, and they'll only be able to take it if you drop it.

>Every run is different. One run you'll have a blackhole gun that shoots 3 different projectiles and an ability that heals you for every bit of damage you do, the next you'll be rocking an aimbot gun with an ability that does extra critical damage.

>Enemy health, shields, armor, etc. scales with how many players there are so they're not a joke. Still a challenge with a full 4 players.

>Constantly growing in strength, soon with the ability to start with a weapon other than the Foundry. (starting weapon)

>Vaults are great challenges to get you occult scrolls, which are ultimately the determining factor of how well your run will go.

Cons:
>Previous area enemies are somewhat forgotten. If they reappear in later areas, I'm unaware of that, let me know if I'm wrong.

>Fight an enemy once and you always have a viable strategy to beat them. You won't find a horsehead enemy that has special buffs or anything, so you can just restrain them with the Crown Prince's E power, then blow them away with an Argus shot to the head.

>Enemy damage outputs become bullshit quickly. Say bye to your shield and 3/4 of your health within 5 seconds, even if you have full on both.

>Lu Wu aggros almost indefinitely on a player in multiplayer until they're downed. It might be the same with later bosses, as well, but once again, it's hard to get further than the desert when enemies can one-tap you.

>Lack of vault variations.

I started off unsure, the roguelite genre was never my thing but the simplicity + the grind within this game is something I clinged onto fast, it's tough to get the hang of, but once you understand how it all works it's an extremely enjoyable game.

So many scrolls, so many builds to try from movement speed and attack to defensive and tank-y. It's something I massively enjoy personally after a fair few hours in the game, I recently completed elite mode and it's an amazing feeling when you commit to a grind like this game, I still have a few guns and scrolls to unlock but when that's all done I will be attempting speed-runs and messing around with builds.

Overall, this game is by far the best I have played in a long time, the reviews are overly positive for a reason and I can vouch for that. It's an early access game, too. This hopefully means new content is coming with time, and a whole lot of it, hopefully.

98,Gunfire Reborn,72111859,english,"So, this is my very first steam review. I got this game because my brother said it would be fun. I went into to it not expecting much but was actually very happy with what I got! The game is insanely fun with many different combos that you can do each time you go through, For a beta, there is a solid amount of content in the game. It is very easy for a new player to pick up and go. Thought there are a few cons, sometimes enemies will do inconsincant attack patterns, the jumping can be a bit buggy in my time played, there is some odd clipping that can happen when doing the jump puzzles which is really aggravating cause it will feel like you get cheated from more loot. Also there are only 2 playable characters at the moment who are very different, tho IMO the cat is a far better character due to its Kit being able to do elemental damage, and all the skill trees work together well where as the dog, the skills don't mesh together that great (mostly due to the fact the he has 0 way to do elemental DMG on his own, and the sever lack of decent explosive weapons). Thought I do think these issues can be fixed/changed. I personally think the dog could get fire damage on his nades, and maybe they could add another roll for weapons allowing explosive rounds at the cost of mag size. I am not a dev. but these are just small ideas that could work. Also I do belive based off the art work there will be another character that is a bird and that would be neat. The gun play and fights are actually really fun, and playing with friends is SUPER fun with all the crazy elemental and weapon conbos you can do. Overall I HIGHLY suggest getting this game if you like rouge like shooters, The game is very fairly priced, the art is amazing and the gameplay for the most part is really fun, The game i can most compare this is Enter the Gungeoun, which is another really fun rouge like shooter.

1,Gunfire Reborn,72107315,english,"This game is way too fun for the price. Here's a breakdown of what it plays like:

It's a simple FPS rogue-lite; you progress through 3 different zones, each zone broken down into several levels, and the last level is a boss fight. If you die, you get to spend some points to improve yourself before trying again. If you win, you get to spend more points. Currently, you can play as one of two characters, each with a distinctly different playstyle. It can be played in coop, and it's very synergetic and fun (more on that below).

Each level has potential of having optional side areas that can be a simple fight, a mini-boss encounter, an obstacle course, or a platforming puzzle. These are always worth doing, as they will give you extra loot. There's also an NPC traders and crafters where you can buy and improve equipment.

You fight using weapons, skills, and grenades. All attacks can be enhanced with elemental damage - elemental damage can also proc, and combining procs will result in satisfying effects. 

Progression during a run consists of scrolls, and ascensions. You start each run without any of either.
- Scrolls are found around the level in a variety of ways - killing certain enemies, looting certain chests, buying them from npc peddlers, etc. The effects can be positive (+40% run speed after dash), sacrificial (double shield, but health is capped at 1), or cursed (-50% accuracy). Most of the positive and sacrificial scrolls can be dropped, while cursed scrolls can't, but you will never ""accidentally"" get a cursed scroll - you get it through conscious decisions. 
- Ascensions are improvements to your skills, grenades, or elemental damage. They are earned at the end of each level, or very rarely during an optional side area called a vault. You choose one of 3 upgrades picked at random from the character's pool of 18 upgrades, and each upgrade is tiered.

With all of the above mechanics combined, you can make some very interesting builds, such as:
- heavy elemental damage
- infinite-ammo bullet hose, 
- long-range sniper
- close-range tank
- high-crit damage dealer
- etc
However, given the RNG nature of rogue-lite games, you're forced to experiment with new builds in each run, which can yield some very surprising results.

Coop is very satisfying. The enemies are tougher, and more abundant. Loot is instanced, so you won't fight with your partner over weapons and scrolls. Also, each person's instance has randomized loot, so if an enemy drops a weapon, one person might see an smg, while the other might see a rocket launcher (same goes with scrolls), so it's possible to help each other work on certain builds by communicating.

Overall, the only thing i find lacking is content - I want more of this game. However, the amount that I got from the current price tag ($12 CAD) is already amazing.",1593970108,1593970539,TRUE,1,0,0.523809552,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,434,25,1381,0,1123,1594136911,,

Otherwise, it's pretty good in single player or multiplayer, and pretty easy to get into a group, at least at this time; it just came out a month or two ago. Check for more recent reviews if you're reading this far into the future.

If you're looking for more of an idea how it plays than what you saw in the trailer, then... well, there just isn't much more to it. The game is really minimalistic.

You shoot the bad guys, the levels are procedurally generated, and after each zone you get to pick a skill to upgrade your character. You'll find random weapons with random attributes, that may or may not fit your build, and after each death you can spend collected SP to get permanent bonuses on future runs. There's also a very simple elemental system (shields are weak to electricity, health is weak to fire, and armor is weak to acid) but that's pretty much it...

Weapons are unlocked by killing certain types of mobs or progressing a certain amount. 

Playing solo allows you to fly through the start but after that it becomes a slog. Multiplayer is a bit risky and there aren't too many playing atm. 

Very high replay value due to you constantly gaining power as you get further and further but you will face walls that just require grinding to get down.

First Impressions: Immediately fell in love with the cell-shaded art style. It has a pretty lack-lustre story to begin (early access at the time of writing review, so I can see something like this being fleshed out much more in the future), however the gameplay itself is what makes this game so GOD DAMN ADDICTING. Needless to say, I was quite happy with my $10 purchase. 

Gameplay: Absolutely fluent gameplay. Very straightforward control layout (keyboard, not a controller kind of guy) and just feels very polished for an early access game. I'm not going to go to far into abilities, simply because there is SO MANY abilities. Weapon choice is very diverse and every weapon feels like they serve a purpose in gameplay (had a great time so far putting killer combinations together). But by far, without a doubt, the greatest element of this game is replayability! I quite strongly HATE grindy games, however this game often rewards you for the effort you put in, and it never feels like a chore. I'm sure once I max level this will change, however with the often changing landscape and mob situations I'm sure I won't be bored of this game for a long time. 

Aesthetics: Beautiful game to look at, cell-shading has always been a favourite of mine but if it's not your bag I get it. The sound production is really well done, not too much going on even in intense situations; I'd say just enough to put you on edge in intense situations, but not enough to make you want to mute and turn on your own music. Music is pretty bland, at least in the title screens/loading/etc. but during gameplay isn't too intrusive and seems to set the appropriate tone for what's happening/about to happen. 

Bosses: SPOILER ALERT (possibly?) Anyway, interesting boss fights, difficult at first but with experience and levelling yourself up they start to become easier and easier (still haven't made it to final boss, however I usually only play solo and look forward to playing with other players in the hopefully near future). Once you get the patterns down, they can easily be solo'd.

Final Thought: If you're even remotely considering getting this game, just do it. The price is (very) right, and if you like FPS titles of any calibre, then this will be a great addition to your collection. Fun solo, and (more than likely) even more fun with friends! I'm really looking forward to the future of this game; it looks very bright, and exciting.

[h1]Description[/h1]
Still in Early Access, Gunfire Reborn tasks you with beating a series of three chapters, each concluded with an epic boss fight. Each chapter is composed of a series of levels, with each level composed of randomly chosen, interconnected room (arena) segments. While the first chapter is made up indoor environments, the subsequent chapters switch to outdoor locations, some being quite spacious. Each room segment or ""arena"" locks you in until you have defeated all the enemies inside. Backtracking is possible if you so desire. Enemies encountered, room conditions, vendors, weapons, and secret ""vaults"" are randomly strewn about each chapter. Room conditions can modify enemies in minor but interesting ways. They also provide an extra item drop upon the area's completion. Vendors come in two variants, a general merchant selling health, ammo, and weapons, and a weapons merchant, selling weapon upgrades of different types. 

""Vaults"" are secret areas accessed by shooting at cracks in walls found during regular play. These areas are the primary source of scrolls, which are passive upgrades (or curses) which can modify your play but are lost upon death. Vaults vary the most in terms of differences to standard shooting. Some act as obstacle courses requiring timed sprints between moving boulders, or timed jumps across tricky platforming segments. All of them are optional. All loot, including scrolls, grenades, ammo, weapons, and player perks can drop randomly, as well as be discovered in chests. All vaults contain at least one chest which unlocks upon completing the task for the area. There are only two playable characters (so far) and both share the same skill-tree. You won't have access to the second until you reach level 30. 

Gold is collected during runs and is used to purchase items and upgrades from vendors. Essence is another currency, dropped from defeated enemies. Whether you play singleplayer or co-op, you can spend essence to revive yourself once during a single game. While at first essence collects slowly, by around level 60 you can easily collect 150 or more essence per run. Essence is spent after each run on passive upgrades in your skill tree. Unspent essence cannot be banked, unless you invest in certain skill-tree unlocks.

Each character can carry three weapons, a default gun with infinite ammo, and two which can be swapped out at will, reliant on specific ammo types. Weapons can be upgraded (leveled up) during runs, increasing their damage. Investments in the skill-tree can also provide a percentage chance that found weapons will possess additional bonuses. Guns will be replaced frequently, particular by new players still trying to learn which ones they prefer. Certain enemies and bosses are suspectible to specific types of elemental damage, made all the more important during co-op runs when trying to synergize your specialities with other online players. Outside of the shared skill-tree, each character has a linear, smaller upgrade path unique to them.

Apart from weapons are cooldown-dependant abilities and throwing projectiles. The starting player specializes in elemental damage, with throwable smoke bombs that slow and corrode enemies who linger within their area of impact. Its special ability shoots a ranged attack that immobilizes foes for a few seconds. These powers contrast to the second playable character. Its special is the ability to dual-wield weapons for a time, with its grenades serving as contact explosives. Both grenades and special powers can be further applified during runs by perks. Within blue chests and sometimes dropped by enemies, goblets grant a player a selection of one of three perks. Each perk belongs to one of three perk categories, with each level of the perk (up to three), granting additional improvements. 

[h1]Critique[/h1]
Gunfire Reborn is like a cheap variant of Borderlands. It doesn't have the same production values, but it is just as accessible and costs about a fifth of the price. Being pseudo-procedurally generated, it also targets shorter play sessions, just long enough to get a quick action fix without the story involvement of NPCs and other ""epic""-type considerations. Aiding this, you are granted the ability to save and exit upon each end-of-chapter boss kill. You can quit mid-run at any time, and still invest whatever essence you acquired into your skill-tree. New mechanics like weapon bonus affixes, secret ""vaults,"" new weapons, new scrolls, all of these and more are unlocked through normal play.

Player perks alter which weapons you seek out. I had one run playing the dual-wielder whom acquired perks that made it immune to explosive damage. I continued to upgrade the level of an early rocket launcher (weapon levels reflect base damage, increasable at the weapon merchant), which just so happened to have a bonus affix that would increase the number of projectiles it fired in a single shot. Coupled with several damage bonuses to explosive attacks, and an increased fire rate while dual-wielding, I was one-shotting most foes towards the endgame. And yet, I still lost. English is not the language native to the developers. However, you will be able to understand at least 95% of what the game is trying to say. The game is undergoing constant improvement, both in writing, and more importantly, in level segment revisions and additions. 

The only reason to not pick this game up is if you aren't willing to play it more than once. Being Early Access, it won't take long before you've experienced all the level-segments a chapter can throw at you. However, it will take long for you to survive long enough to realize it. There are a lot of things to unlock. This includes additional weapons, a harder difficulty mode, numerous scrolls, and more. You strengthen your characters through the skill-tree, and you lengthen your play sessions through learned ability. If you aren't the type of person that improves their play quickly, investments in the skill-tree can feel like a grind. In 31 hours I've beaten the game once, and made it to level 60 of 120 in my skill tree. This is not the end. A harder ""elite"" mode awaits, as do a dozen or so scrolls to unlock specifically in this difficulty.

[h1]Verdict[/h1]
Gunfire Reborn is worthwhile. It is one of the only games I bought for a friend, specifically because I'd want to play it with them. This is a diamond in the rough, playable from start to finish, still undergoing improvement, and a complete steal at the price. Fans of shooters, not put off by cutesy enemy designs, will not be dissapointed.

However, Just a few hours in and you can immediately tell the most glaring issues the game has and most of the criticisms can be directed to the fact that this is an Early Access game.

Since this is a co-op game, naturally you'd be teaming up with players. However, most of this game is just getting yourself carried by higher level players, where you'd hide behind cover as they kill everything because you deal 0 damage and dies to a single hit in higher stages. The alternative? You grind, hit a wall and die, repeat. Either way, these gameplay loops for new players just feels terrible to play with. I was planning to have a good time when getting into this game, but all of that just slowly disappeared.

Speaking of dying - when Bosses are defeated, they drop loot that are usually upgrades to your current arsenal. But the thing is, if you die during the boss fight (or before the boss fight and your team can't revive you because they have no copper), you can only spawn AFTER your team has left the Boss room. That means the person who died, who needs help the most in progressing the rest of the stages that are gonna be tougher than the previous ones, are stuck with the garbage weapons that they died with from the previous stage. Who.... who designed this?

Anyway, those are only two of the many gripes I have with this game. Even though it has so much good going for it, I've grown frustrated with it in the short amount of time I played with it. There's still a lot to complain about, such as lobby bugs, sound bugs, instant deaths, enemy design, overall game balance, etc. but I digress. I'm only 5 hours in, for all I know this could be the best game in the world and I'd be none the wiser. I was hoping this was going to be my next Vermintide 2... but oh well.

[b]Gunfire Reborn | Roguelite (Read: Random stuff, high failure rate, high restart rate) First Person Shooter Looter | 1-4 Players | ~12 bucks price tag.[/b]

[u]Positives:[/u]
+Easy to sink into gameplay loop. Load in, get going
+Multiplayer. It's the way to cheese the difficulty back just a little, since bosses will target one person, leaving the other 3 to get it done. Player revives are also a bonus. More enemies (with scaled up health no less) also spawn in multiplayer, making the gain of soul essences (permanent unlock currency) rather easy and plentiful compared to solo play. where you get far less.
+Guns all feel great thus far. each with their own effects and kick to em* (*devs already showing that they're favoring buffs over nerfs, though one gun -did- get nerfed slightly. This is great since...y'know, it's a fucking random game. Don't nerf things we're not guaranteed to get every run!)
+Variety of upgrades makes progression fairly obvious. You visibly see improvements and can quantify the upgrades you unlock via boosted ammo counts, health counts, damage reductions, etc. 
+Difficult. People fellate difficulty all the time and unless you're a god at this game, it's not going to be easy.

[u]Negatives:[/u]
-Spawn rates of high-threat enemies are a constant. Certain enemies will sit 800 miles away from you, shoot you with HOMING BULLETS/SHOTS, and eradicate you if you don't get rid of them. Yes, they're a priority target. No, the sniper bitch in the back of the desert shouldn't have damage resistance better than a boss you just killed while being a high powered threat! 1st area has 'Longbow' enemies that spawn in high packs and will end runs - take warning.
-Two characters (For now). One's viable, and one's only viable if you get god RNG and are able to survive long enough while being trash to get said god RNG upgrades. Won't say which is which - elitist scum will easily bark this one out.
-Dash Bug still prevalent (Press shift to dash! Automatically brings up your Steam Overlay and gets you smashed ingame. Might be fixed at time of writing? Who knows.)
-Difficulty spike inconsistency. If your luck is good, you won't have issues getting to the first boss. However, if your luck (read: with room types and enemies) is bad, you will get a longbow room and suffer horrors of low ammo and lower survivability. There's always one 'douche room' in Temple 4.  Also, the first boss is going to make a few people refund this game, since there's a massive learning curve when you go ""AW YEAH FIRST BOSS"" and immediately get oneshot because you dodged too early without knowing jank mechanics. The area after the first boss is also big fat booty cheeks with enemies that have double the HP of the first area, damage resistances, teleports and general nonsense of moving without sound and coming up behind you with flamethrowers. The game goes from EASY to STUPID very fast, and this isn't including the third area.
-Limited Biomes. Game isn't fast enough to consider this a positive. Wizard of Legend has the same few areas, but that gameplay is snappy and quick (though just as sponge-enemy heavy) so you don't get bored COMBINED with variety starts. You always get the same order in Gunfire Reborn (Temple > Desert > Coast). Game kind of gets boring if you don't shape up and escape the Temple, since that's 100% the most seen, bland area. and...
-Limited Rooms. ...the rooms are samey too. You'll find that at least in the temple, the rooms are made of the same 'tiles'. You know 'that one room with the right turn that leads down a staircase'. Stuff like that, doubly so for the 'vault' rooms. It'll always be ""THE SAME BOULDER ROOM/FIRE ROOM/ENEMY ROOM"" rooms. 
-Random Chinese invasion /(This game's Early Access)! Why does it say I <chinese symbols> someone when I'm trying to revive them? Why does it say I <chinese scrabble> the voice chat when I left it? Weird! Game needs polish and general de-bugging, but...that comes with Early Access territory.
-Difficult for the wrong reasons. Oops, first boss smashed you cause you didn't know what to do! Oops, first time in the desert, Coyotes bite your balls off! Oops, didn't realize that scroll you took that says ""+damage, crits disabled"" is actually a FUCKING NEGATIVE. Oops, game didn't give you a weapon to beat the boss with in realistic manner - guess you lose! Oops, last boss has mechanics far more than any other boss in the game and you get BRIEFLY told what to do and the warning goes away followed by instant death by cannonballs and the worst part is you can't practice bosses since it's kind of THE LAST THING IN THE GAME YOU GET TO!

It's better than some standalone Roguelites as is, but it's not in the echelon of glory that Nuclear Throne or say, Monolith - reside in As it stands, I'm giving it the thumbs down. I have nothing better to do so I'm playing it more and more, but I can't -personally- recommend it as is. For a Roguelite, it's just a wee bit too unforgiving. Maybe they'll add easier difficulties or more intimate fixes to make that first area a typical roguelite first area (read: easy to pass and naturally flowing in difficulty so you don't just slam into a brick wall in the second area.)",1593867001,1593867001,FALSE,2,2,0.415757746,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,510,57,1389,0,510,1595778079,,

Playerfinding:

72,Gunfire Reborn,71926046,english,"Enjoy games like Borderlands? This game ""borrows"" many elements from it, but as a roguelite, and you get to be a cat with a gun.

-PROS-
-The controls are tight and movement feels great for early access (Have not used a controller yet)
-Lots of randomness in your scrolls (abilities) and talent trees.
-Currently two characters to switch between with different talent trees.
-Easily 30+ guns all with unique feeling to them.
-Multiplayer is easy to use and I have not personally had any trouble playing with friends (Have not used matchmaking yet)
-Great progression system leaving you with a feeling that every run gets you closer to unlocking more.

-CONS-
-Currently only one weapon is seriously powerful without a ton of bonus' to it. Prism (throwing dagger)
-Needs more curses....I like to be punished for my hubris.
-Could use a few more enemies.
-I'm struggling to find cons now, as I can see most of them getting fixed with more updates and additional content being added.

The devs are constantly updating the game. They just recently added text chat, which is good because some of our team only do text.

Enemy attacks are well telegraphed, but don't be fooled, you will find yourself overwhelmed very quickly if you don't pay attention. The gun play is fun and rewards skill for hitting weak spots, and the gun combinations themselves can be fun and quite powerful, my favorite gun is the Bone Dragon, an explosive gravity ball launcher. The ascensions which are guaranteed at the ends of each level make for nice and steady progression of your abilities, and each ascension path has its own strengths. Occult scrolls are like items; their effects can be positive, negative, or both, and they aren't guaranteed drops. The only complaint I would have about this game is that the Occult scrolls feel like they don't synergize very well. Their individual effects can be beneficial, however the wording of some scrolls leads to  confusion about how the scrolls would affect each other, if at all.

Challenging enemies.
Weapons look and feel awesome.
Beautiful visuals and smooth game play with very few bugs.
Play as a gun wielding dog or cat.

Extremely satisfying gunplay, movement and just combat in general. The progression of the talents tree from what i have seen looks to be pretty rewarding and balanced and the progression during a run (scrolls and weapons) not only gives the opportunity to make a unique build every run but also makes it so that you actually have to think about what weapons and scrolls work well together. 

I just like how this game feels like some of my favourite games (Borderlands, Dead Cells ...) blended into one, taking what i love so much about them and give an amazing and extremely enjoyable experience. Very much looking forward to what this game will become in the future.

Let me start of by saying, if the tag 'roguelite' detours you from this game, do not fear, i've played PLENTY of roguelites, this feels so much different, you're given a reason to go back. During the game you pick up these things called 'soul essence', which help you level up, plus, you unlock new scrolls, scrolls are usually picked up by drop but mostly found in 'the vault', which is a key thing to do in the game for progression. These scrolls in corolation with certain weapons can make a CHEESY wombo combo, which just feels so satisfying to do. roguelite games usually make you feel like it's your fault, but once you reach level 10 you get co-op, so instead of blaming yourself your more subject to ""what can i do to help my team more"", or in my case, you and your pals diss every bad part of the boss. 

The satisfactory level in this game is INCREDIBLE, like i said, you can use scrolls with certain weapons to get S T R O N K, for example, lets say you have a fire weapon, fire weapons deal really  good damage to health, but not much to shield,  if you grab an occult scroll that pierces enemy armor on critical hits, you can obliterate a large enemy EASILY. and also most of the bosses are pretty fun, most of them, MOST OF THE BOSSES ARE FUN I GUESS YEAH ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY JUST SPRAY POISON IN EVERY DIRECTION AROUND YOU SO THAT THERE IS NO ESCAPE FROM THE G R O U N D S L A P. 

TL;DR - if you like guns, satisfactory (not the game), dying and starting again and a not toxic community, this game is for you.

Combat is satisfying and bosses are challenging but simple enough to master. Im eager to see what new things will be added in the future as I am already at the point some 25 hours in that I've beaten the game multiple times. 

Something that I find myself doing is going for the same weapons and builds every game though. I would like to see either more weapons or buffs/ scrolls/ or skills that specifically improve on weapons that I dont even use because they just arnt good enough. 

Also upgrading at the forge guy is nice but you can either upgrade damage or reforge a weapon. I dont mind the reforging but it would be nice if weapons had tiers, like the classic gray to yellow/gold tiers we see in lots of other games, and a choice to upgrade the weapon to the next tier with random stats.

I also find myself never really buying anything other than scrolls or buffs from the merchant. There are plenty of runs where I never even stop at him if I dont need ammo. I end most of my runs with stacks of cash because neither the merchant or forge guy seem to ever have anything worth spending money on. Maybe im playing wrong but it feels like there could be different things sold from the merchant.

11,Gunfire Reborn,71810987,english,"I'll start off with the bad. The content is pretty lacking as you'd expect from an EA title, so you have to be the kind of player who enjoys rogue-likes and/or theory-crafting build synergies to get the most out of what's currently good with the game. There's only 2 classes and the randomness in the levels doesn't really feel very random at all since it's really just what order chunks appear in and no randomization within the chunks themselves, and it's the same enemies all the time. There are interesting challenges that rarely spawn (maybe they're more common on higher difficulties that I haven't unlocked) that make things a lot more interesting, but I rarely see them. The difficulty curve is a bit ridiculous, as the initial levels are a fucking cake-walk and then Lu Wu comes and smashes your shit. You'll eventually be able to beat him but fuck, it is too much too soon. I needed to bring a lightning gun for his shields camp around the pillars and then I was able to start consistently beating him solo. The graphics and audio get the job done. Not really good or bad. Just good enough to not be a distraction.

Now onto the good: there's a TON of guns! the guns are all have pretty unique gameplay hooks, and they did a great job making interesting modifiers for the guns. On top of trying to find guns with cool modifiers, there's also rogue-like style items (scrolls) that gives your character interesting modifiers AND an arpg-like skill tree that you can try to flesh out each time, AND game progression at the end of each run. The customization is really the highlight of the game and you can tell that's where most of the work has been placed, and it's what makes me the most confident about the game going forward, because the diversity of builds and guns alone is rich enough to be worth $12, I was that impressed.

[b]TL;DR:[/b] An FPS roguelike with a solid amount of content, polish, fun/unique weapons, and a good amount of variety in enemies and levels (ignoring the first area). On top of all this, the developers have been updating the game [i]every week[/i]. Highly worth the $12, or $10.55 if you get it while it's on sale.

Gunfire Reborn has been compared by many as ""Risk of Rain meets Borderlands"". While I'm not sure about the Borderlands comparisons, the developers were definitely inspired by Risk of Rain 2 while developing this, and that's not a bad thing. Risk of Rain 2 is a fantastic third person roguelike, and turning it into an Asian-themed FPS sounds good in my opinion!

I currently have 7 hours in the game and I've completed it once. The game currently has three areas, each of which has 5 stages/levels and a unique boss fight. Each stage is slightly randomized with many different layouts to switch between, as well as randomization in the form of vaults (mini-stages with challenges, occasional mini-bosses, and extra loot inside), and the chance for challenge modifiers in the main stages. 

There's a good amount of variety, especially with the second and third areas. The first one starts to feel a bit same-y, there's really not enough variety in level design with it (and some rooms are much too cramped for four players), but hopefully they'll work on that one more in the future. The other two areas however are excellent and drastically change each time I've gone through them.

In each stage you have a random chance to also find the Peddler and Craftsman, otherwise these two are guaranteed to spawn in the room prior to the area's boss fight. In exchange for gold coins (which you collect from kills), the Craftsman will upgrade your weapons or change an inscription (weapon attributes). The peddler sells food (pork buns!), ammo, grenades, three random weapons, and a final slot is saved for either a fourth random weapon, or a scroll.

Scrolls are basically the same idea as items from Risk of Rain 2. Perks with various benefits (and sometimes negatives to counter a large benefit). There are also Cursed Scrolls which will give you a large negative, however these can be countered by a Scroll that simply makes you immune to them, if you're lucky enough to find it.

Unlike Scrolls, which you lose between runs, there are also Talents, which are character upgrades. You can buy Talents by spending Soul Essences, which drop from killed enemies occasionally. You can also spend these during a run to revive yourself if your teammates can't get to you in time. Any you don't spend after a run is over will be lost for good, so be sure to spend them all on that final Talent screen!

I should also mention that there are currently two heroes to play as. The one you start with, a cat, can throw smoke grenades (which leave a pool of toxic damage for the enemies to deal with) and an energy orb they can shoot out of their paw to freeze enemies for a few precious seconds. The second one, a dog, is unlocked at level 30. He has the ability to dual wield weapons and throw explosive grenades. Both are fun to play as and each have unique Talents to unlock.

At first I thought this game would be more like Borderlands, since so many were comparing it to that series. Where are the randomized weapons, the open world, and the hub area? Why can I only hold two weapons (excluding the pistol)? Because this isn't Borderlands. At all. This is a roguelike! You aren't going to be spending much time looking at your inventory, you wouldn't want to have to juggle more weapons, and you definitely wouldn't want completely randomized weapons. Other than the cel-shaded artstyle, I'm really not sure why people keep comparing it to Borderlands...

A hub area would actually be quite nice however, but the game doesn't need it, at least not right now. Would be a neat thing to add way down the road, though.

[b]Conclusion:[/b]

So, now you understand the basics of the game now, but is it any good? Well.. It's great. It's a very well-planned out roguelike with fun Scrolls to change up your playstyle, very satisfying weapons, a lot of enemy variety, and excellent level variety and designs for the second and third areas. If you're like me and you've been wanting a really good co-op FPS roguelike, you should definitely check it out. It's a measly $12, the developers update the game [i]at least[/i] once a week, and you're already getting a solid amount of content; and unlike other Early Access games, this one seems quite polished. I've yet to run into a single bug.

[b]Complaints:[/b]

The only complaints I have right now are that the first area's boss is a [i]wee bit[/i] tough the first dozen times you fight him, and that entire first area could use a rework as it's too cramped and close quarters, especially when you're playing with three others, and it doesn't change enough between runs. I'd also like to see more areas in the future, but that's almost guaranteed to happen anyway.

For a game that only released a month ago in Early Access and received NINE updates (!), this game is in great shape and I can't wait to see what they'll be adding to it.",1593589637,1593589869,TRUE,2,0,0.509836495,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,1894,101,430,0,430,1593580692,,
33,Gunfire Reborn,70304756,english,"The desert areas after the first stages of the game are really hard to do single player, but the game is really fun. The stage progression reminds me a lot of Risk of Rain 2 and the combat is a lot like in Borderlands. The dodge mechanic feels good to use too — when you pull off last second dodges against the first boss using the mechanic, it leaves you feeling like a god. I am sure that this game is a lot better with friends, but have not yet had the chance to play it with any. It is fun to play single-player though.

I can't wait for some more content to be added to the game. I hope they add additional hero(es) to use before level 30. This might give coop a little more variety, as multiple players won't have to all choose the same character and share the same ability for the first several hours. The only bugs I have encountered were minor. Other than bugs, there were some minor spelling mistakes.

Edit: Also I forgot to mention that this game is only TWELVE DOLLARS. Compared to other early access games (especially those in the past), this game offers so much more at much less cost.

Post-Multiplayer Edit: This game gets really hard with how health and enemy-count scaling works. Boulders are sometimes laggy and rubberband back and forth. The second boss gets so much health from multiplayer scaling that it becomes a war of attrition against death lasers.

74,Gunfire Reborn,71746225,english,"I dont recommend this game - unless the full version will be greatly improved. 

I don't understand why it has so many favourable reviews. It is basicaly Serious Sam with just couple of very small, random levels - meaning it is getting boring quickly (many people say its roguelike mixed with Borderlands but thats absurd. Just beacause it has cartoonish graphics and numbers fly when you wound monsters doesnt make it similar to Borderlands...).

Bad:
- Very grindy - slow character progression & tough bosses
- Level generation is very simple. After couple of runs everything looks the same, including special mini-levels (vaults).
- Very random - sometimes you get great upgrades and best skills in single episode, sometimes nothing
- For a roguelike, it has very limited variety of weapons and their stats. (Again - it is NOT like in Borderlands, where one type of weapons can have much different combinations of stats/abilities). Forging possibilities are also minimal.

Good:
- Basic weapons look nice
- Opponents and bosses are interesting
- Had fun for first few hours

82,Gunfire Reborn,70460866,english,"Honestly, don't let looks deceive you. Yes this is indeed a Chinese indie(?) game and yes, there are issues associated with that and the fact that this is an early access title for $12 dollars. I very much had those same reservations when looking at this game myself.

Only to play it for a bit and find that there are new and surprising things that come out of this game every time I play it. 

Now, as far as brass tacks are concerned, this is very much a Rogue-lite shooter. If you've played shooters like Borderlands and Doom, and played rogue-lites such as Dead Cells and Rogue Legacy, this is definitely going to feel //very// familiar to you, to the point where you might ask yourself ""Hey, this just seems like it's kinda ripping those games off, doesn't it?""

To be honest though, the developers here do an absolutely great job at actually giving each element they have used from those games their own flavor and style, and they've put a shocking amount of effort into this game that really makes it shine. 

On one point, my favorite element absolutely is the gunplay. There is a vast variety of different unlockable guns that you'll find each play through that do things that, again, will feel very familiar, but will also feel like they have a fresh play style to them. Even the sounds of the guns in this game actually feel like even if it doesn't do damage, they've got some serious weight to them, which is always a plus in my book.

Another surprising element is how competent the AI actually is. Yes, you do have your usual lot of melee and tank dudes that run at you trying to get a hit on you, but you will also run into enemies that will keep you looking for cover and will even flank you at times if you're not careful. It really keeps the run-and-gun flow of this game actually really thrilling, particularly in the 2nd stage of the game, at least for now considering that I don't personally know if they will actually add more stages to the game.

Obviously there are issues with the game. Again, being that it's available in Early Access, you're definitely going to run into some oddities such as not being sure what actually constitutes as cover in this game, or translation issues due to this being primarily created in China.

Overall however, I've had a splendid time with this game. It offers the same risk-reward kinds of gameplay that you expect from other such games in the Rogue-lite category all in a very small and pretty package. For only $12 dollars, it's hard to beat  a game like this. I genuinely believe the Developers have rightfully earned the Overwhelmingly Positive rating that it's achieved over the past couple of weeks.

[h1] Pros [/h1]

[b] Guns [/b]
The gun variety in this game is incredible. Each run in this game is different, with each chest and enemies dropping different weapons and loot every game. Gun-play is super smooth and crisp, with each gun having different recoil patterns, muzzle flashes and even different effects (Decay, Burn, etc.)

[b] Abilities [/b]
Both of the characters have 2 skills: secondary and primary. For example, one characters primary ability is an Energy Orb that does AoE damage and freezes enemies in place, and his secondary ability is a smoke grenade, which [i] somehow [/i] does damage. Where as the other characters primary ability is dual wielding weapons. Both characters have a passive ability which allows them to dash forward. All of these abilities feels smooth and have beautiful effects and graphics.

[b] Multiplayer [/b]
Like most games, this game is 10x better with some mates. Nothing else said.

[h1] Cons [/h1]

[b] Level Design [/b]
The levels is this game are very bland and each feel as cliché as the other, [spoiler] until you get into the next world [/spoiler] When moving from one level to the next, sure, somethings change, likes some boxes or props sprawled out, but they all have pretty much the same layout, and can get quite boring after hours of play.

[b] Lack of characters [/b]
Gunfire Reborn (At time of review) only contains 2 characters. I would love to see some different characters in the future, all of which have different appearances, abilities and maybe even voice lines. The characters at the moment have no emotion, and share no personality or voicelines.

[h1] Final Verdict [/h1]

All things considered, this game is awesome. Gunplay is amazing, sound is superb, and multiplayer is super fun. Sure, its a little rough around the edges, but when this game releases from Early Access, I'm almost certain the developers would've made the game better then it is at the moment, not saying its bad in its current state. I highly recommend buying this game, even in its Early Access state, because it is purely amazing, and is super cheap.",1593501725,1593502081,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,60,3,329,24,293,1602072363,,

24,Gunfire Reborn,71702523,english,"I haven't played a campaign-based first-person shooter in years. I tend to find them either too frustrating or too boring. I also don't like competitive shooters; they incite too much anger in me and others. So why did I buy this game? And why am I reviewing it? I suppose it all boils down to curiosity. There was a lot of praise poured into this game, and it looked intuitive enough watching gameplay and review videos that I thought I would give it a try. If I didn't like it, then I probably would have mired myself even further in my disdain for FPSs. So, after two hours, what did I think?

Well, when you begin the game, you are instantly dropped into the perspective of a samurai cat-person wielding a gun. The game's tutorial teaches you the basics very quickly, and the mechanics it introduces are quite easy to grasp. I played the two hours I spent with this game using a controller, and a few quirks aside, I didn't have much problem playing with it. Obviously, not having much experience playing these types of games, I missed a lot of shots and took damage when I could just as easily have dodged it. In a way, it made me feel like I was a kid learning the ropes again. But while I did get frustrated sometimes, I was always motivated to keep playing.

When you begin an adventure proper, whether solo or coop, you are tasked with reaching the end of a set of rooms and dealing with the enemies in your path. At the end of the last room is a treasure chest that contains a power-up and a portal leading to the next section. There are several sections leading up to a boss; while I have never gotten as far as the boss, these sections do get increasingly harder to deal with. And since this is a roguelike, no two runs have the same types of rooms and enemies, so strategy must be put together on the fly. I tended to play a little cautiously, taking careful steps to make sure my ammo was high, my shields regenerated and my skills replenished. 

You start out with three skills: a dash to quickly avoid enemy projectiles and attacks, three smoke grenades that deal damage over time to all within the blast radius, and a purplish orb thing (I can't remember the actual name for it) that freezes enemies in place for a couple seconds while also dealing damage upon impact. These are very useful for taking control of the battlefield, and there are occasionally other hazards that may help or hinder your chances of survival. As an RPG fan, I appreciate this kind of strategy.

Sadly, the fact of the matter is that if you're not good at FPSs like I am, you will die quite often. When I died at the end of a run, I was greeted with a results screen and the option to spend Soul Essence on upgrades to my stats. I didn't always have enough Soul Essence at the end of a run to upgrade, but it kept me motivated to get more so I could improve my chances of succeeding a run. I really like that dying doesn't put me off from playing another run, but encourages me to play better. Heck, I would've played more if I wasn't compelled to sleep for my own health.

Although I've only played this game for a short while (up to the point where I can't refund it anymore), I can't say I didn't enjoy my time with it. I intend to play more in the coming days, and I certainly look forward to the developers' progress on the game in the near future.

So far it just feels like a long grind to unlock stuff that doesn't really do anything better than the previous weapons. Over the 2 hours I played, I made it as far as the 2nd boss and the whole time never cared about anything I was unlocking. With most weapons it really doesn't make a difference what you pick up, other than fire rate and ammo type. The pros and cons of each weapon are so negligible that I didn't bother swapping once I would find the rocket launcher and the big machine gun. With any other weapons, the boss was so spongy that I couldn't even get the through a quarter of his health after 4/5 add spawns. The machine gun alone dropped the boss before the second wave even started. I couldn't ever tell if the synergies were working, nothing seemed to ever make me feel more powerful. Even in a run with 7 scrolls, I wouldn't have been able to tell the difference to not having any all. So I feel like I'm just going to waste my time grinding for stuff that isn't much better, or just isn't fun to use. The weaponsmith also didn't really do anything, upgrading a rifle twice still took the same amount of hits to kill a basic enemy.
 
Can't say much about the AI cause every single roguelike fps I've played has had awful AI. It's all auto-follow until melee range, move to line of sight and shoot, or throw some AoE at you. Playing aggressively felt like it took much longer to clear a room, compared to just hiding behind something and nailing headshots constantly. 

I think a couple of these problems could be fixed by playing co-op, but I'm alright without that these days. Just hoping it has a lot more attention spent on the solo experience. Bought it because everyone compared it to isaac, dead cells, and borderlands. Honestly, I don't see any of those games in this other than the randomization, and bullet sponge enemies of borderlands. Isaac and dead cells both have so much depth to them and this game is missing all of it. Those games have the potential to either make you feel like a god, and/or sometimes give you an awesome challenge, and I'm just not seeing it from this game. 

I'm still recommending it because it has some potential and was a good price. I just really hope that it's not just another early access let down.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]

Weaving through semi generated dungeons, you take on a variety of enemies where they all have small but unique patterns solo or coop.  It takes the elemental factors of borderlands where fire is good against flesh, lightning against shield and corrosive against armour.  Mix that with collecting occult scrolls which act like artifacts form slay the spire (give you a passive bonus) hidden behind vaults (can range from destroy all enemies in a room to tricky platforming), and a decent weapon variety.  You slowly understand which weapons and play styles benefit more from certain scrolls you pick up.  This makes for some pretty unique runs. You currently can play as two characters at the moment, the crowned prince (as I'll relate to the cat) and Ao Bai (the dog). The cat has the ability to shoot a projectile which stops time for the enemy and puts them into stasis  (reminds me of BOTW and link's stasis ability in a small AOE) and the dog which duel wields like the gunzerker from borderlands.  Each character has shared and unique talents between the two that you purchase at the end of a run with soul essence which you collect through your run.  This can range from more HP to crit damage to other various things.  Since this is a roguelite game, you are going to die... a lot.  Enemies can sneak a surprisingly amount of damage when you're not looking so you become more aware of them in next time you face them.  

[h1]Pros[/h1]

[list]
[*] super fluid gameplay that feels rewarding as you try and try again to beat  enemies and bosses alike
[*] large weapon and occult scrolls (give passive bonuses) to adventure through
[*] challenging enemies
[*] the producers have a very solid (and successful IMO) foundation in what they want to achieve, which to me is to have a tactical run and gun gameplay
[*] Devs are super responsive to feedback
[*] it's like $12 for a game that will easily give you more than 12 hours of gameplay if you like shooter roguelites
[*] I like big numbers I cannot lie
[/list]


[h1]Cons[/h1]

[list]

Suggestions:

please, please, please add boss variation, enemy variation, room variation, more player characters. I love grinding through this, and being the type of gamer I am, I don't mind grinding through the same levels over and over, but I think you could reach a wider audience with people that are less tolerant to grindiness. Plus, as far as rogues go, this one is currently pretty monotonous. The boss of each level is the same every time. While it is a sufficiently challenging boss, I think any good rogue is gonna thrive most on as much variation as possible in the runs. A lot of the rooms are also the same, and the enemies in each type of room, seem to always be the same mix.

Also I've felt at times that my inability to progress was more linked to a need to level up my talents more and do more damage in general, than to an inability to overcome the situation skillfully

Basically, I've loved this so far, but it could get old quick without a great deal more variation/content per run. I really really am looking forward to seeing what you'll do.

It lacks a bit of polish. Don't get me wrong, it's not really expensive, but I believe that this game could do more in the long run so I'll list down all things I've noticed so far.

CONS
-Lacks Music - each level is randomized, but the lack of music in the background just makes the whole thing stale for me.
-A lot of terrible guns - I've played Borderlands and yes, there will be stale weapons, but I think you guys might keep adding and I do hope so.
-Stale Level Generation - Oh man, this is one of the worse for me. Every level is randomized as I've said before, but oh boy, like one of the reviews I've read, it just seems the same. Maybe adding variety to the walls and so on would help this.
-UI Design - The menus of this game could use some work to be honest. Of all the things that I thought would be polished, it would be the menu screen.

I won't list down Pros because a lot of it is still halfway there but here's my TL:DR

I would still recommend this game to anyone who would like to try something new. The enemies maybe bland but hopefully you guys get to add more. Definitely grab this during the sale if you can and support the developers. The reason why I made it seem so negative is that so the devs will take notice of all the things they can improve upon on.

93,Gunfire Reborn,71637881,english,"This game could be something really huge, if the devs continue to follow up on the development of it

I enjoyed my time playing this game, and feel that I've gotten a good impression of the game, it currently has 2 heroes, to choose between.

One irk is that you have to reach lvl 30 to choose the second hero, I do not know why this is, as I really felt the second unlockable hero was worse than the starter hero. (cat) I switched back after two runs with the new hero.

The gunplay is nice, the weapons are nice, although it suffers from the fact that there are a few weapons like prism that are viable throughout the run, the rest are honestly terrible, making you ignore 85% of weapon drops, which is sad. If I recall correctly there are 37 guns in the game at the moment, this is really noticable ingame, which currently is acceptable as this game is in early access.  I hope the devs go the same route as Enter the Gungeon, with a vast arsenal of guns to choose between!

I am not sure I like the talent tree system at all honestly, I like getting better through method and skill, not adding more damage to overall percentages and whatnot. I do hope they make the talents less valuable so to speak.

When you die in game, you have the chance to spend half your skill points aquired that round to ress yourself, I don't know if I really agree that that's a good way to go about it. I would rather have insta-deaths unless you get an item at hte shop, or a scroll to ress you, that way there is more risk involved!

The AI in the game is something I found at times really bad to be honest, it seems like if an AI targets my friend, I can literally walk up to it and shoot it in the face, and it will still try to hit my friend across the map instead of focusing on me. This is something REALLY frickin important to fix.

Something I would have liked the devs to take a look at is the enemy spawn system, sometimes you are at an encounter where waves of enemies spawn, but a big problem is that the spawn points seem to be static, so if you complete a wave, and stand in the designated spawn area, which you won't know until it's too late, enemies will spawn on you and instantly kill you, this is something I have experienced several times. This is terrible.

I mean, the rest of the game has organic enemy entrances where they jump over rocks and come out from places you can anticipate, why not do this for all spawn? It is ridiculous sometimes.

There is still a LOT of work to be done here, A LOT, but for now it seems to be solid start!

A big gripe is still that the maps are really repetetive, you will grow tired of them in about 1 hour, the vaults you jump into has very little variety to them, sometimes you will enter two vaults in rapid succession, and they will literally be the exact same vault map, with no difference at all. I mean, why not code it so that if one vault instance is entered, that instance won't be selected from for at least 1 vault, so you won't get two in a row, this is some minimum requirement thing I feel, and it is really weird that it isn't the case.",1593421676,1593421676,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,336,20,617,0,617,1593373453,,

Hopefully in the future some more behind the scenes design things will be tweaked.

Some people don't see it, but the game definitely took a bit more than inspiration in some of it's animations in particular.

It took me 24 hours of game time and 70+ character levels to beat the game on the hardest difficulty. The great thing about it is that I feel like working my way down the talent tree truly did make a noticeable difference in my ability to progress in the game.

Some of my favorite features:
- Save points at level transitions allow you to continue a run at a later time
- Weapons feel distinct and have loads of personality
- A complete run of the game only takes about an hour
- Actually useful and game-changing talents
- Really fun / ridiculous skill and item combinations

Some of my not so favorite features:
- Frequent insta-kill deaths where you're left wondering what happened
- Timed platforming challenges. Feels extremely out of place in the gameplay loop
- [strike]Bandit sniper enemies in Stage 2 have very tiny / seemingly inconsistent hitboxes[/strike] (This has since been adjusted in a patch)
- Early game may not have enough ""fun"" factor to keep people playing
- Characters can get soft-locked at a lower level if they are unable to beat the first boss to afford more expensive upgrades

It's Risk of Rain, Borderlands, and Hades all wrapped in a very slick package. Oh and Overwatch because it's a fps

You take the 4 player aspect for coop and general mayhem, the insanity of stacking skills upon skills to make wonderfully stupid builds, and the replayability rouge-likes in a tough but fair progression system. 

The game demands a more active playstyle compared to Risk of Rain, but is quickly rewarded with how ridiculous skillsets become as you start accumulating more as the run progresses. Earning and exploring new weapons as they are unlocked is one of the most sastisfying things the game has to offer, as each new gun offers a new play style encouraging the player to reevaluate potential synergies and novel tricks.

The game purposely holds back all it has to offer in a tight progression, keeping things very fresh. I don't expect the game to get old for a while yet, even as players progress into endgame.

The feedback system is surprisingly accessible,

41,Gunfire Reborn,71608211,english,"Tl;Dr - If you're a fan of roguelite's & have been searching for a solid FPS roguelite, this game is for you. If you're searching for a more traditional FPS that has set levels, chests, weapons etc, this game MAY be for you, as long as you accept that it has none of those features and is a true roguelite. Also, if you like to try and defeat a game of the first run you might want to look elsewhere, since it's a roguelite you'll die.... ALOT.

Performance: Aced. The game runs smooth and I haven't encountered any considerable FPS drops, although I'd note this is one of the games where it's best to let your gpu handle AA & V-Sync and just turn those options off in the game. I'll also note that due to the above, this game doesn't really like to play well with gpu ""enhance game settings"" options so, you either want to let the game run those settings or your gpu, not both. I use the gpu and have had no performances after making those adjusments. My current rig has a quadcore processor & the game runs smooth as butter on it, so, if you have a mid range pc, fear not, you don't have to minimize visual settings to get 60 FPS.

Visuals: The artistic style is consistent and immersive. The low poly/cell shaded design feels just right for the game and, with the above setup, I might add that this is one of the few games where I could turn on/up settings for water and shadow & max post processing. That tells me that the dev is good at visuals and optimizing said visuals. The fonts, for the most part, are complimentary and the HUD fits in naturally. The gunso are unique and reflect that, it certainly doesn't feel like they are just reskinned clones and the visual effects differ, giving a feel that you are genuinely firing different weapons. Complimenting that, the firing animations are unique too. Maybe just so slightly depending on the fps, but it's definitely noticeable and is a nice touch.

Sound: 10/10 Great soundtrack, excellent ambience, wonderful sound effects. The game is spot on in this department too.

Gameplay: First, allow me to reiterate what I did in the Tl;Dr. This game is NOT a traditional FPS. Its levels change, the enemies are extremely difficult, and though the game mechanics allow for skill based success in terms of things like crits, it's wears a roguelite badge and wears it well. If you're looking for a game that can be played from the beginning to the end without dying, you'll be sorely disappointed as the power creep starts happening as soon as you start a run. If you buy this with that mentality, it's very possible you won't make it past the first boss. The game was designed with death in mind. Dying is something that will happen, and may happen often as this is a roguelite to the truest extent in terms of unforgiving difficulty even on the initial difficulty option (normal). I feel it important to stress as I've seen a decent amount of complaints about how the game is flawed because it's nigh impossible to beat the first boss in the first go. Since it's a true roguelike experience, please understand that means its difficulty is consistent the whole game through. You must learn/be willing to learn to expect the unexpected and also anticipate that the AI operates at the same level, bosses were meant to be gatekeepers, less actual bosses. Once more, as this is important, if you're looking for a game that has 0 RNG and is purely skill based, this game is in the wrong game for you even though it's an FPS. For those who are looking for a good roguelite, on the other hand, this game is right up your alley as long as you're not looking for a Gungeon or Binding of Isaac clone as it is a clone of neither and it should be pretty clear that it shouldn't be a clone of either. I'll probably add to this section later as I need to touch on other points and there's only so much you can say with only 1000 words. Suffice to say for now, that if you are looking for an original game that does the roguelite bit right, I'd recommend getting this game for certain.

Difficulty: 11 out of 10 would die again. The game encourages accuracy for most of the weapons. It utilizes a weak point based crit system that, once you learn for each enemy, can help make most runs long ones. Otherwise, it's what you'd expect from a roguelite Learn. Adapt. Compromise. Kill. Die.

Controls  = Solid. Keys are rebindable and this game thankfully avoids using the arrow keys for anything by default, although, if that's your fancy you can gimp yourself by rebinding to arrows. Importantly,  I can't notice any lags and though I think the dash mechanic needs tweaked, still fires straight away when shift is pressed. 

Overall: This is another excellent example of Early Access done right. The dev is responsive and their game feels well polished and complete even now. Sure some might not like that there are only 2 classes & 3 levels, however, the characters are different enough that that's a non-issue & from what I've heard, dev's going to be releasing at least another character sometime during the development cycle. As far as levels, think of it like a chapter less a level, each level is comprised of I think 10 maps that vary from the claustrophobic to the expansive. I do believe there will probably be more levels added later, in the meantime, this game is fully functional and provides a well polished experience even on a mid-range pc and possibly for lower end rigs to boot. I can tell by how the game plays that the dev cares for this game and has technical expertise and am glad I bought the game as I'm interested to see what the Tao has in store for them in the future. I'd recommend buying the game and trying it out if you're even vaguely intrigued in roguelite fps's as a concept. I won't compare this game to Binding of Isaac as I really get sick of seeing people berate an original game by comparing it to that aesthetically displeasing mess. The only comparisons I can think of in terms of gameplay, would be RoR2 although, it's 1st  person not 3rd and I really want to emphasize that's a loose comparison as it truly is its own unique gem of a game. If you've stuck around to read this end to my review, then I'd say the game is probably going to be a good fit for you, plus, it's only around $12 US, but is more complete than most games that are triple the price.",1593383389,1593383389,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,291,14,2675,131,188,1601782820,,

What could be improved:
- Interface (light blue text on dark blue background on a poorly lit environment wont grab the needed attention)
- Fonts could be improved as well as alignment in the menu. I get the theme but we could use some less wild fonts.
-  The alerts could be more dynamic (opacity/size reduces as projectiles are farther). I panic a lot when I see the exclamation points only to realize I was out of range anyway.
- Slightly more enemy visibility (looking at you sneaky spiders) especially in very poorly lit environments.

Great, fun little indie game. Among all the early-access titles out there, this is surely a little gem.

It is a bit short and repetitive, but a lot of fun nonetheless and surely worth the small price. The developers delivered a surprisingly challenging, smooth and pretty much bug-free experience (which in itself is a nice surprise these days).

[h3][b]Negative:[/b][/h3]
[list]
[*] Quite repetitive, as you always start from the ""beginning"" aka the same environment. The map order is random, but mostly they look the same.

[*] Not enough true weapon variety. There is a lot of different weapons, but they don't really alter the play-style that much.

[*] No close-combat weapons aka swords.

[*] You are stuck with the cat character until lvl 30. This should be a choice from the beginning.

[*] The rolling ball maps are just not fun.

[*] Matchmaking works fine, but currently you can't decide to only play as 2 or 3, it's always 4 - which makes the game way too easy.

[*] Some of the ""upgrades"" effects are not very well explained, you see the stats but don't know if it's good or bad.

[*] The critical-hit sound is way too loud.
[/list] 

[h3][b]Positive:[/b][/h3]
[list]
[*] Very bug free so far, I only encountered a few (e.g. getting stuck in the lobby) but they are rare.

[*] Combat is smooth and fun, yet suprisingly challenging.

[*] Hunting for upgrades and new weapons is quite addictive.

[*] The enemy AI is ""smart"" enough to actively seek cover or flank you.

[*] The artstyle is clear, good looking and not distracting. The effects fit the artstyle very well.

[*] Sound is good (except for the above mentioned crit-sound).

[*] Updates happen quite often and bugs are adressed rather fast.

[*] The community is very friendly. I haven't met any toxic players yet, which is surprising and nice. =)
[/list] 

So all in all, for this low price and considering how hard working the single developer seems to be, you can't go wrong with this game.

It's a great fun to sometimes just ""jump in"" for a while, to let off some steam and blast your way through hordes of enemies.  >:)",1593282312,1593334746,TRUE,0,0,0.488323599,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,77,41,524,0,524,1592684070,1593310645,"We never tweet any pictures that are not appropriate for children, and we only retweet some pictures with many like created by our players.

8,Gunfire Reborn,71545331,english,"I had just come across this morning and I have to say that it was the best thing that I have ever come across when it comes to rougelite  games. After buying the game I played for 4 hours straight and then when I went to take a break to see if any of my friends would buy the game, I went to play something else but every minute that had past I thought more and more about opening it up again. That's how addicted I have gotten to the game.

For the people that are looking at the game considering buying it, I say you should. If you like games like borderlands, Dead Cells, Risk of Rain 2, or even any other games that are in the rougelite category then you have to at least try the game out. Although there is not too much to the game yet, only two characters at the moment and the fact that it is in early access, I still think it is one of the best games to come from a small company in 2020.

The graphics are very pleasing and for me I consider them very cute. On the way of controls, I think that there is a bug that has to be worked out with walking backwards where I would get stuck on something that wasn't there but other than that I would consider them very well done and smooth.

The last thing that I want to say is that I think this game is a good one that if you are still not sold on, to keep your eyes on and either follow the game or add it to your wishlist.

3,Gunfire Reborn,71458654,english,"This is an Early Access review

Typically I don't even bother looking at Early Access games, but this one looked so polish and crisp I thought I'd give it a try. You probably keep seeing borderlands thrown around when describing this game. It definitely has that vibe, but in a dungeon-crawling-esque setting. Enemies can have shield or armor on top of their hp, and like borderlands, shock, corrosive, and fire elements each have a use. 

You get 2 weapons plus a starter pistol. You can only carry 2 weapons at a time, so you have to mix and match as best suits you.

Weapons: weapons are quirky, have special effects specific to each gun as well as small bonuses called inscriptions. If you enjoy borderlands weaponry for its wackiness, you'll enjoy these weapons. Most importantly, however, they're all fun and satisfying to use.

Enemies: what makes a great game stand out to me is enemy variation, and this game has it by the spades. If you enjoyed games such as Sanctum 2, Borderlands, Destiny, etc for their enemy variation, you'll like this game.

Movement: like everything else about this game, movement is crisp, responsive, and clean. You can't sprint but you have a dash. 

You'll die a lot at first, but pretty soon you'll get the hang of it. At the moment, my only real complaint is there isn't much content. And by that I mean, I'm at 60 hours and starting to feel the repetition as I grind for the last few unlocks currently available.

The shooting is fun and tight. Enemies are deadly and can easily kill you in a couple hits if you don't avoid their attacks. There seems to be a bit of a story involved, but its not central in any way. 

The 4 player coop works really well. I can't comment on the lag since I was the host each time, but everything seemed smooth. You don't compete for powerups as everyone gets their own. It is definitely more fun to play with friends than alone.

As an early-release title for it's given price, there is definitely a lot of potential put into the games design - giving possibilities for new playable characters with different playstyle opportunities. 

The maps do get a bit repetitive, seeing the same line-up (Catacomb - Desert - Fjord) and up scaling difficulty (bigger enemy shields).

The only con to this game is how linear the use of soul essence is as an important currency to player leveling. Simply 'Play, Farm, Die' is easy to understand for any player to grasp and can continue to do so without any thought. But the RNG nature of this game for enemies & chest rewards; plus a sometimes brutal difficulty increase as a reward for defeating a boss, feels grueling to experience; at the very least not fun.

If gaining soul essence had a stronger incentive like essence skill tree access in the 'resting area', in anticipation for upcoming difficulty; or maybe players can use soul essence for opportunities to guarantee a rare scroll or inscription appropriate to the immediate dungeons; than players could have a stronger interaction with influencing the more immediate state of their experience; rather than waiting for sweet death so they can start over again.

36,Gunfire Reborn,70279434,english,"Gunfire Reborn is an extremely-addicting roguelite FPS inspired by titles like Risk of Rain and Borderlands set in a stylized fantasy China. In Early Access, the game more than holds its own and has a solid foundation held up by its dedicated developers. Even after reaching max level with nearly 65 hours in the game, GR's gameplay is so fun that I still keep coming back to it.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
GR's gameplay loop is similar to other roguelite titles; kill enemies, get resources, spend resources, repeat. As of June 26, two characters are available to play, which I'll go over later in this review. You're able to carry three weapons, with your first being your basic weapon with unlimited ammo. There are three elemental damage types for weapons: Fire, Shock, and Decay, and this results in a rock paper scissors-like style to counter enemies. Shock tears through shields, but is weak against armor and health. Decay rots down armor but is weak against shields and health. Fire burns through health but is weak against both armor and shields. In a coordinated group, you'll want to diversify the elements you have access to kill enemies efficiently. If you're slick, you can even combo elements, like Fire and Decay, causing an explosion.

The game rewards you for accuracy and knowing thy enemy. You're able to target specific weak points on foes, such as the head or back on certain enemies, to deal increased damage. Loot is Diablo-like, and you'll always be making judgments on what weapons you pick up according to what kind of playstyle and build you're looking to achieve. For example, if you're going with a MORE DAKKA minigun build, you might want to look for weapons that have rate of fire or ammo gain stats. If you're going for a sniper build, you might want something like crit% to increase your crit damage on a headshot.

As you progress through levels, you'll gain scrolls which buff your abilities or give you unique effects. These scrolls will synergize with specific builds. For example, one scroll permanently removes your shields but allows you to regen health passively. This synergizes extremely well with another scroll that increases your damage when you have no shields. Scrolls often build off each other this way, and you're able to explore builds for each character because of it. I remember a build I ran with the dual-wielding dog that removed my shields but allowed me to leech health because of my Fire damage on enemies, effectively making me nigh-immortal so long as I was continually shooting enemies.

You have a dash and two abilities, grenade and active. Your grenade and active change according to which character you play. There are two characters currently available in the game as of June 26, both with their distinct playstyles. The Crown Prince is built all around elemental damage and field control. He has a grenade that lays down a poison cloud that deals DoT damage and an energy orb he can throw out to freeze enemies. Ao Bai, the Dog, is more of a brawler built around no-nonsense damage. His grenade is just straight-up explosion damage, and his active is the ability to Dual Wield. There is some speculation of a third character coming up, which may be a sniper, but that isn't confirmed just yet.

There are currently three stages, which each take around 20-30 minutes based on how fast you go. Each stage is broken up into four to five levels. The levels are designed like arenas, where you'll need to kill enemies to open the exit to go into the next room, similar to titles like DOOM. Occasionally, you'll also be able to enter secret rooms. These rooms can be one of two types: Platforming or Combat. Platforming can include dodging boulders Indiana Jones-style or leaping across platforms. Combat means you'll need to clear a room and often kill a miniboss that spawns at the end. Either way, you'll get a scroll at the end of it.

At the final level of each stage, you'll fight a boss. These bosses will be hard when you meet them, but they all have counterplay. The game can be hard, but it is never unfair. You can avoid every single attack an enemy can throw out if you know when to dash.

[h1]Presentation[/h1]
GR's setting is based in a fantasy China. You play anthropomorphic characters, like the Crown Prince, a cat, and Ao Bai, a dog. Enemies are either humanoid or also anthropomorphized animals. For example, there's a sniper enemy in the game who are seagulls in straw hats. Later, you'll find beefcake Sharks who reel you in with a hook and punch you. No enemy is a carbon-copy of another. You'll have to approach each one differently, each requiring a specific type of counterplay.

Weapons are also extremely unique and endearing. Two of my favorite weapons are the Justice and Fire Dragon. Justice is a red lizard that shoots out remote-detonation bombs when you squeeze it. You reload it by slapping the lizard over the head. Fire Dragon is, as you guessed, a dragon who wraps around your hand and shoots fire at your enemies like a flamethrower. Most weapons feel very good to shoot, and I can't help but smile at the ones with unique reload animations such as the mentioned two.

[h1]Progression[/h1]
GR has a strong foundation for progression. You have two currency types: Coin and Soul Essence, and you gather both as you kill enemies. You can spend coins at a merchant to buy weapons or ammo, health, or grenades, or you can spend coin at the craftsman, who can upgrade your weapons' DPS. You lose your weapon upgrades and items if you end a run. You spend Soul Essence on talents at the end of each run, and all the talents you've bought with Soul Essence carry over to future runs.

There are also character-specific talents, like increased damage during Dual Wielding for the Dog or faster Shield Regen for the Cat.

[h1]Design[/h1]
In Early Access, the game's inevitably going to be rough around the edges. Certain vital features aren't available in the game, such as the lack of a pinging function or a scoreboard. The game is also peer-to-peer. If the host leaves, the run ends. But I do recall there being talks of adding dedicated servers. The English localization isn't as good as it can be. Wording on certain things can be incorrect or weird-sounding grammar-wise. And there are little bugs here and there, but there's nothing game-breaking. They'll get ironed out as the developers work on the game.

As it is, a lot of love and care is put into GR, and it shows. The devs are dedicated, and they genuinely listen to their player base and make adjustments to the game based on feedback. I wish other developers were like GR's. Even with the language barrier, their love for the game and their players shines through.

[h1]Verdict[/h1]
GR reborn is a game that may be rough around the edges, but it has a rock-solid foundation that still proves extremely fun and addicting. It's criminal that the devs are only selling this for $12. It's an absolute steal. If you're a fan of roguelites, this title should be in your library, no questions.

Support an excellent, unique game that will only become even better from here. GR is an easy 10/10, and I highly recommend giving this a try with the low entry price.",1591268555,1593205073,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,329,9,3919,0,3856,1595725434,,

51,Gunfire Reborn,71415548,english,"I found this game whilst browsing Twitch. And honestly, I've had an absolute blast so far with this game.

The core concept of the game is a roguelike FPS as advertised. Currently in Early Access you are dropped into 1 of 3 zones, each ending with a boss and a portal to the next. Each time you die or kill the last boss, you are taken to your perks screen where you buy perks that carry over game to game and make you stronger as you invest more time into the game.

The weapons system in this game is akin to a dungeon crawler or a looter shooter. There is a selection of weaponry that all have their gimmicks, yet come with randomized stats that you can sometimes reroll and level up at certain chests and the Blacksmith NPC.

The heroes, currently only two, play quite differently one from one another. Each have 18 'Ascension' perks that alter, improve, or change how the character operates.

Overall, the game is quite good for what it is currently. For once, it appears the current developers are invested in bug fixing the game, but I do hope it continues to expand with more levels, characters, and weapons in the future. It's a good start, and I would love this game to expand into something that matches the quality of Dead Cells, Binding of Isaac, Heroes of Hammerwatch, and the multitude of other fantastic roguelikes on the market.",1593189184,1593189184,TRUE,1,0,0.523809552,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,290,11,1455,0,1056,1599506189,,

0,Gunfire Reborn,71352269,english,"I had high hopes for this game as it has been described as being similar to Dead Cells, Borderlands, and Risk of Rain. I have played a lot of all three of those games. This game is like none of those games. 

I imagine people draw these comparisons due to the fact that weapons drop out dead enemies randomly, there are skills to acquire, and because you can get resources from the environment. So why isn't it like any of those games?

This game is lacking in polish first of all. The argument that it is in early access could be made, but this level of polish is fundamental. Enemies don't make sounds when approaching you, feedback on being hit is non existent, enemies and their head hitboxes are comically large, shooting feels wavy and airy even on low sensitivity, enemies are so so easy while bosses have mechanics that make them unfun, feeling like a ""hard"" enemy that is designed to keep you playing the same part over and over just to unlock more for your character (which would be fun, if this game was fun). 

This game has some interesting ideas, but the execution feels like it is trying to take from a lot of things without bringing anything incredible to the table. This game takes from all of the previously mentioned games without improving on that formula. It's actually just a worse way to try and play these games, which is why I feel it is similar to none of these.

Just look at other famous rogue lites-Binding of isaac-Heroes of hammerwatch-Risk of Rain-Enter the Gungeon.

Nerfing popular items is not the right way. If you want players to use a specific gun or scroll then those items need to be buffed. Human psychology responds more to positive reinforcement. 

For example. Fire enthusiast was an item that causes constant Fire damage but gives you a bit of lifesteal when using fire weapons. They then increased the fire Damage over time to a point where it only has a niche value. No player will pick up this scroll without having an established build. Couple that with the fact that it's a tier 1 scroll that you will most likely receive before it's higher leveled partner and it's obvious why no one uses it.   

In the Current state the game shows lots of promise. 
1-This game was translated from an asian language and it shows. Lots of grammatical issues. Makes some of the guns effects hard to understand. 

2-Multiplayer is broken right now. The ping is unbearable. Please fix the Server Issues. 


3-Revive mechanics are wack yo.  The new revive system through the shop leaves something to be desired. Using your teammates money to revive you. IF there is a peddler.

Overall great game.. Good graphics. Weapons feel good, which important for shooting games for some reason. 

The game feels like there aren't enough opportunities for gaining power between levels.

Speaking of item drops, the weapon design is sick. Each enemy has their own behavior, which you learn to play around.

People describe this as a mix of Risk of Rain 2, Borderlands, and Enter the Gungeon (of which, I only like one and immensely dislike the others). I would not say that is accurate. If there was one that it did match out of the three, it would be essentially a linear Borderlands with smaller levels. A more condense (and as a result, solid) package in a way. I wish it didn't have stat-increases that you purchase after runs because it makes it feel as if the player will run into a statistical wall that they can't get past unless they grind level up tokens. I have yet to discover every build but at the beginning of the game it feels like they all the viable ones are just elemental builds. This is a result of all the totems that you use to give yourself a perk often have elemental bonuses. Enemies also take more damage from certain elements. Guns do feel good to me because they actually do damage surprisingly. I haven't unlocked every weapon yet. I hope they have more variety and secondary skills because most of the guns I have only have a primary fire. I'm not a big fan of the first boss because he runs off to recharge shields and health, which only prolongs the fight. It does bring enemies in to give you ammo, but I'd prefer if they just attacked during his fight with me. Overall, I think the game could do a lot of things better. I haven't unlocked everything yet and I imagine there's a lot of content. I hope they keep adding more that's actually good because it breathes life into a roguelite.

72,Gunfire Reborn,70861833,english,"At the moment unplayable due to balancing issues but it has a great potential and it is super smooth regarding controls.
Unfortunately, this game took the worst from borderlands and risk of rain 2 - tragic elemental system which is only required for health bar minigame ""yellow hp bar means I need green damage, blue hp means I need blue damage, red hp - red damage, yay, fun, I almost pooped a little thinking about the excitement"". It could be just dps+effect and that's it, no need for this nonsense that ruins the fun.
Regarding risk of rain 2 - amazing getting one shot system and barely dodgable homing attacks.

EDIT1: After additional 23 hours and reaching level 90 I can say that balancing is turbo terrible. 80% of weapons are beyond useless especially those that don't have element or aren't explosive. There are only 2 builds: elemental fusion (2 element combo) and one shot bazooka build, that is it.
One of the most absurd things is that the most builds use constant weapon swapping. Most runs take up to an hour, so it becomes very tedious very quickly to weapon swap for an hour. It would be fine if only 1 build had it but both characters even have skills that are related to this, several occult scrolls are related to this. Atrocious.

75,Gunfire Reborn,71196910,english,"Early access game, for the most part it is quite a fun game to play.  Co-op play is a must to advance through the permanent skill tree because as you progress through each scenario/dungeon, the enemies get a bit harder to kill.  There are two skill trees in the game, one permanent and one temporary as you progress through the game.  The secondary skill tree is interesting because you get and encounter certain buffs/debuff items that for the most part will help in making you stronger.  For the most part, in the beginning you'll start off with a basic gun and will pick up other types of guns as loot drops from the monsters killed.  You can only carry 3 guns, one of which is your basic gun with weak unlimited ammo.  Different types of guns use one of three types of ammo that you pick up throughout the area.   Certain gun types do affect your movement speed.
Now, the permanent skill tree needs a bit of work because the only way to progress through this skill tree is by collecting Soul essences(SE) that you get from enemy kills and not all of them drops this.  SE can be spent between scenario clearing or when you die.  The accumulated SE can't be saved up and has to be spent entirely at the end or your dungeon run.  Initially, you can collect enough SE to clear the first tier but it gets grindy to get to the next tier because now it ramps up so high that you'll not collect enough SE to progress very far.  On top of all this, if you die in the dungeon, you can spend these precious SE to revive yourself.  But if you die again, you'll not have enough SE to upgrade your permanent skill tree to the next level, this can become quite frustrating after a certain number of unsuccessful dungeon runs and all collected items are reset to zero including the accumulated SE.  This grinding fest can become tiresome and frustrating, if playing by yourself.  As an example, let's say you do an unsuccessful run, die and at the permanent skill tree menu. You've accumulated 28 SE, depending on skill tier you can only spend points in one skill tree item.  Tier skills cost go like 5, 10, 15, 20, etc. you get the idea.  You spend all the SE that you can but ultimately you'll lose the remaining SE because it does not carry over to your next attempt at the dungeon run; later on there is a permanent skill tree pick that will allow you to carry over a certain amount.
Shield and life bars: this is influenced by your permanent skill tree (temporary dungeon item buffs to some degree).  Shields will auto-restore itself but your hit points don't and can only be restore just a little by either monster drops, dungeon vendor(purchased by in-game coins), or item bonus buffs.  Some enemies have shields and armor bars that you have to overcome too.
Weapons: There's different types of guns that you can pick up with different stats/effects and uses different ammo.  You can only carry two special guns at a time so pick your preferences on which to carry.  So far running out ammo doesn't seem to be an issue but you can run out of them and have to switch to another weapon or drop to your weak default gun. Special guns from dungeons do not carry over to the next scenario. You'll always start with your basic gun only.
Item buffs:  You'll encounter different buff items as you clear each area from area chests.  Some helpful, some not or I could not tell the difference. These buff items are random and do not carry over from one scenario to the next.
Enemy AI:  To some degree, not bad.  A good mixture of melee and ranged attackers to keep you moving.  The enemies will move to cover or dodge your gunfire.

Mechanically sound, lots of variation in weapons, perks, and enemies - it has the core of what great roguelikes/roguelites need. Balance is imperfect, but the game is still very much being tweaked in that sense, and in my opinion, having broken combinations in a roguelike makes it more fun, and I consider it balanced if they're rare and have conversely terrible combos that render your run hilariously impotent.

I am a little bit disappointed in the way progression is handled between runs right now. During runs you collect currency used for post-game upgrades, your Talent Tree. A set of the upgrades you can invest in will enable weapons you find in future runs to have more properties attached to them, giving them more variety - these bits of progression are ones I consider proper in a roguelike structure, they unlock more possibilities in your future runs, but not always in a good way, and encourage more creativity in making combinations work, or just generally deciding whether or not to take a weapon. However, the rest of the upgrades are just objective upgrades to your character eg more health, more shields, more damage; basically they make your numbers bigger and better with no real change to how you play, which feels like padding the content.

Overall, I would recommend the game, just with a bit of nitpicking

But then the designers added a bunch of clever mechanics in the form of elemental damage, random scrolls, weapon mods, and talent trees. And somehow the combat system feels particularly solid, much more engaging than AAA shooters.

Oh, and the co-op mode is unbelievably fun. Shooters like this often feel weird with multiplayer because there's no way to map the main single-player game (quests, waypoints, progression, etc) to multiplayer.

As a person who isn't that great at Roguelite games it does an amazing job. After 25 hours I don't believe I had beaten the 2nd boss, yet now I can almost 75% beat the 2nd boss. I have beaten the current game, but after you beat it on normal you have ""Elite"". At this moment I'm not going to try Elite. 
In summary if you liked the feel of DD, but want a pure FPS with roguelite elements than get this. 

Pros:
Developer
Rogue Like
Level Design simple but crisp.
Look/appeal factor. 
Weapons are unique
Both current playable characters feel unique, and may have different roles. 
Rewards 
Platforming unique but difficult (it's very very little) and the recent changes were great to it.

Cons

Each and every gun has some little interesting quark that makes it fun to use, although some guns definitely need a re-balance as they range from incredible to absolutely useless even if they have a decent inscription. Most of the runs I've been able to complete boiled down to getting lucky with crit damage scrolls and weapon inscriptions to hit insanely hard along with the deflection shield to take next to no damage whatsoever. 

Besides some bugs that the devs are constantly ironing out and a few balancing complaints, it's a pretty damn solid game for how cheap it is and it's definitely worth picking up.

---{Graphics}---
☐ You forget what reality is
☐ Beautiful
☑ Good
☐ Decent
☐ Bad
☐ Don‘t look too long at it
☐ Paint.exe

Cartoony Hong Kong culture inspired art. very good looking, but nothing to rip your pants off for. Not a large fan of post processing either, sometimes the game has a blur to it as if it dropped resolution while playing. not sure if bug or the intentional look, but game makes up for it.

---{Gameplay}---
☑ Very good
☐ Good
☐ It‘s just gameplay
☐ Mehh
☐ Starring at walls is better
☐ Just don‘t

Shooting feels tight, and a wide variety of weapons, and a varied skill tree offers a unique play style for each game. Right now I'm taking one weapon each and seeing how far i can make it through before dying. Two characters are available at the moment each with their own play style as well.

---{Audio}---
☐ Eargasm
☐ Very good
☑ Good
☐ Not too bad
☐ Bad
☐ Earrape

good sound track and weapons sound punchy.

---{Audience}---
☐ Kids
☐ Teens
☐ Adults
☑ Human

Nothing too violent, gun use and cartoon violence.

---{PC Requirements}---
☐ Check if you can run paint
☐ Potato
☑ Decent
☐ Fast
☐ Rich boiiiiii
☐ Ask NASA if they have a spare computer

Game can dip when alot of effects are in use, but other than that it seems decently optimized, however I don't have any hardware available to compare it against.

---{Difficulity}---
☐ Just press ‚A‘
☐ Easy
☐ Significant brain usage
☑Easy to learn / Hard to master
☐ Difficult
☐ Dark Souls

Game offers a lot for beginners, each time you die you can invest earned currency into your characters stats allowing even the most new of players an easy transition.

---{Grind}---
☐ Nothing to grind
☐ Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks
☐ Isnt necessary to progress
☑ Average grind level
☐ Too much grind
☐ You‘ll need a second live for grinding

Each time you die you earn points to reinvest in your character, this is the ""grind"" Gunfire offers. It's very nice not losing all power a character has and progressing each and every time i start a new game. Even if i die early, there's always something earned.

---{Story}---
☐ Story?
☑ Text or Audio floating around
☐ Average
☐ Good
☐ Lovely
☐ It‘ll replace your life

I think there's a story, going to be honest i have not payed attention to it. Seems good though.

---{Game Time}---
☐ Long enough for a cup of coffee
☐ Short
☐ Average
☐ Long
☐ To infinity and beyond
☑ Haven't played it entirely.

Game seems to have an ending from what I can tell, I've only gotten to the third set of stages before dying however.

---{Price}---
☐ It’s free!
☑ Worth the price
☐ If u have some spare money left
☐ Not recommended
☐ You could also just burn your money

12 dollar. what more can you say brother.

---{Bugs}---
☐ Never heard of
☑ Minor bugs
☐ Can get annoying

6,Gunfire Reborn,71183945,english,"This is a nice little FPS rogue-like. There is permanent progression (which is quite solid), pretty diverse weapons, and quite good gameplay. 

Pros 
- Fast gameplay, snappy action
- Seems very well optimized, or at least compatible with lower end machines. Never seen it drop below 140 FPS on a mid-high end PC.
- Multiplayer!
- Loads of ammo and nades so you never really run out, making the gun-and-run style flow seamlessly
- Most of the upgrades feel super powerful, but the game is scaled accordingly well - you get both a challenge, and that feeling of ""being overpowered""
- Permanent progression/character upgrading feels pretty good and has a noticeable difference
- The elemental system feels pretty good though some of the descriptors are a little unclear

Neutral
- Tile-based levels can feel repetitive, but also means you know the layouts after a few runs
- Some abilities/talents definitely feel much stronger than others, which makes the weaker ones unappealing
- Most of the weapons are okay to decent, while some are overpowered af and others are absolute garbage. 
- Some enemies feel kinda same-y (especially in the first zone)
- Visual direction may not be appealing to everyone
- Some weapons and animations are clearly ripped off from Overwatch lol

Cons
- Still EA so limited content overall (2 character choices, fairly small artifact/""scroll"" pool)
- Some weapons are definitely overtuned, which means a lot of runs might end up feeling similar (Kunai/crit/poison build)
- Some hitboxes feel very very off or misaligned
- Perma progression can feel super slow after level 40 or so due to upgrades costing ridiculous amounts of currency
- Some visual jittering due to limited animation frames; more noticeable at 144 hz

20,Gunfire Reborn,71169324,english,"They need to have stages of early alpha when a developer marks a game as early alpha, because some early alpha games are mostly complete and just need a little work. This is the OTHER end of that spectrum, where it's something you would show as a proof of concept for the first level of an actual game, using stock assets as placeholders.

They would need to remake the whole damn game before I'd recommend someone buy this for anything more than $5-$10, and that's if you're desperate for something to do for an hour, because by then you've seen it all. The only thing left is grinding the same build over and over because there's only one build for each character.

There is no ""Rouge"" elements here. The maps are the same exact maps every single time, in the same order. They're all generic looking and flat....I legitimately think the developers didn't even make the maps or models... They look so cheap and corporate I wouldn't be surprised if those were leftover assets sold by some closed-out Korean MMO Developer from like...2000.

And right now? There's two builds. That's it. 

That's because the game is so ""Basic"" with it's one randomized element, the scrolls and chalices (Items and ""levels"") that there's no synergy or neat effects to discover. 

Sure, ""Chance to throw a free grenade"" sounds nice, except grenades are already LITERALLY POURING OUT OF THE GROUND. Sure, it ""pairs"" will ""regenerate a grenade every 10 seconds"" but in the end, you're playing the same exact character as everyone else. There's no in-character diversity.

If you are the cat, you are playing elemental damage and occasionally pressing the ""skill"" button.

If you are the dog, you are playing explosive damage and occasionally pressing the ""skill"" button.

You can't build these characters any other way, because EVERY skill that you get funnels you into these builds. You can't make a cat build where he uses explosive weapons or uses stealth using his ""smoke"" (poison) grenades. You can't make the dog better at using elemental weapons or being a rushdown dual SMG user. And even if you did force it, you're just making the game a slog for yourself because you're denying yourself upgrades to counteract the horrific health scaling of some of these enemies. 

You have to pick your character knowing that you're going to be stuck following the same path as you did last game.

And that also means finding two of the maybe 3 ""good"" weapons and then using those for the whole game. The rest of the guns do such terrible damage even against the enemy types they're ""weak"" to (also the weaknesses are either not working properly or they managed to code fire to be weaker against enemies who are bare flesh (Which fire is supposed to be strong against) than enemies who are in shields. (Which is supposed to be lightnings thing.)

If you're the kind of person who actually enjoys watching terrible, boring movies just to laugh at them, this game is for you.
It's like ""The Room"" but in videogame form.

The final version is supposed to contain ""more perfection.""

They should start with trying to make the basic gameplay good and enjoyable before they start shooting for perfection. Right now, there's unavoidable attacks that one shot you, environmental damage with no visual indiactors, Enemies getting stuck off map and ending the run for everyone, puzzles and challenges that actually cannot be completed.

[b] • TL/DR • [/b]

Honestly, if they just upped the movement speed, jump height and gunplay to be more snappy and less slow and grindy, It might be more fun, but as it stands? No. I would not suggest this game. And do I have faith about the future of the game? Not really. It seems pretty low effort and cash-grabby.

I do not really have faith that the developers can even make the game more enjoyable though updates and patching, since their current ""idea"" is just as generic as humanly possible. There's no substance whatsoever. The gunplay doesn't feel nice, the sound design sucks, the graphics are bland and look like assets.

It's not super hardcore in terms of optimizing builds which is nice, makes for a more fun experience and easy to jump into random matches, as you don't have to communicate with your teammates too much.

44,Gunfire Reborn,71110603,english,"First I would like to say, this review will be in three segments whole. The first, visuals, the second, audio. Last but not least, the content/game-play.

The low poly graphics are not original but beautiful. It is not a secret that low poly graphics are simple to make, but they allow for more of the beauty of the game to show. This game, unlike the common triple-A game, does not need amazing graphics to be fun. The animations are crisp for most things that include the character such as gun reload, gunshot, ability use, etc. If I were to change anything involving graphics, it would be enemy animations. I don't find them to be bad, in a way, I see them to be repetitive. For example, the first boss is often too slow to catch up to the player at absolute max speed, including scrolls and dash that effect so. This forms a long-winded still frame of the large entity that is right in front of you. There is also a great number of visual effects with particles and the like but I know the devs patch many of them daily. The last thing I can think of when it comes to visuals is the map. The map design is very original and fun. What I don't like is how bland the first set of stages is with the dark blue and seemingly nothing else. It would be nice to see tome texture or perhaps a wider variety of colors.

For audio, I will talk of music then the sound fx later on. 
The music is good, but not outstanding. I often find myself listening to my list of songs because the in-game music can be both too frantic and too calm for the situation at hand. I would also like the team to flesh out, perhaps, a different ost in general. I will not push this too hard as this is just personal taste and music does not make or break a game. 
The sound fx are often a little buggy when character actions are protruded quickly along with enemy interactions that bog with the sound emitted. These bugs could include silent shots, very loud claiming sounds of scrolls, and player upgrades. Along with much more that I can not think of. 

The game-play is where this game stands tall; it is quick-paced, thought-provoking, and replay-able. No matter what gun you head-shot with, whether that be a gun that only does around 70 damage when you do so or a gun that does 4000, it is still just as satisfying. The enemies have A.I that is memorable and easy to attend as your playtime increases.
 For example, each boss and elite monster seems impossible until you learn the power your utilities have. This includes your character's kit or the scrolls and upgrades you get through time. 
While I would like to throw straight compliments at the devs the whole time, I would also like them to know my feedback on the overall game-play loop and content. The loop is fun, just repetitive. The leveling system earns you powers and great abilities but I would like to see more ability and less percentage count increase. Sure, taking overall less damage is great, but a different type of smoke bomb would be good too. I would also like to see more enemies and guns added to the game. But I will not complain too much about content such as that because the devs are most definitely focusing on patches at the moment. I just hope to see more content soon. 

This is all I have to say about this game, for now. I hope you all have a nice day!",1592716022,1592795199,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,133,20,1358,14,455,1601395361,,

1,Gunfire Reborn,71123736,english,"TL;DR at bottom

Pros:
* Frequent game updates and community suggestions get implemented fairly consistently
* Very clean art style
* Good gunplay with variety of weapons
* Okay gun sounds and enemy sounds
* Secrets and non-mandatory bonus platforming sections
* To date 2 characters with very different playstyles and abilities
* Large variety of enemies divided into 3 thematic areas
* Large variety of skills you can gain while playing, resulting in ""unique"" builds and synergies
* Scratches the Risk of Rain itch of being a rougelike with satisfying power creep if you build your character right and are lucky

Cons:
* Enemies sometimes shoot out of their behinds
* Seemingly lack of enemy composition balance on Elite difficulty, resulting in extremely spongy one shot enemies in extreme cases
* Some enemies have homing missles and/or rapidfire capabilities, making them very difficult to deal with if they surprise you
* Despite the variety of weapons, only a few are actually useful - you collect others as a stopgap solution to deal damage
* You are forced to build characters a certain way in order to keep up with enemy HP creep, which can be a major run killer
* The platforming is sometimes frustrating and sometimes requires precision above what I would expect from a shooter.
* Some scrolls are nigh-unusable with the penalties they incur
* No fox hero to play :(

Random info:
* 4 player peer-to-peer coop. Occassionaly the game will rubberband you during a puzzle, but it seems rare. Netcode seems solid.
* A full run takes around 1h. No endless mode as of now.
* All items need to be unlocked by fulfilling certain conditions. Took ~60 runs (including failures) to unlock everything

TL;DR
A very well made game that is a pretty great coop experience and replacement for RoR 2, when you get tired of it. I intend to keep on playing this, and do so at least once a day. It has its flaws, but you can learn to overcome them and appreciate the challenge.

The only negatives I can attribute are to early access and even then theres suprisingly few, like maybe one or two mechanics are annoying or not polished such as a certain enemy or some of the ways reviving is handled, but otherwise the game is truly great.

So like, this game is like [u]Borderlands[/u] mixed with a hint of  [u]Dead Cells[/u].

The difficulty scales reasonably, and in multiplayer it has its own challenges.

This hasn't been the case in any other roguelite I've played, where with enough skill difficult bosses can be beat even with the most elementary of gear

In addition a lot of enemies will, seemingly at random, take off almost all of your health with one attack; this isn't only unfun, it's incredibly frustrating and takes away from how good this game could be

The gunplay is smooth, the guns themselves are varied, the enemy types are [for the most part, looking at you homing arrow archer] fun to fight against and provide variety.

Each run you can unlock new abilitys/weapons by achieving missions like ""kill x amount of enemy y"" for your future runs.

The balancing is ""ok"". I played the game Solo. The first 24 hours i spend struggeling at the last boss in normal mode, after finishing that one i unlocked the expert mode.

Pros:

- Its fun
- Its easy to learn the game mechanics and all the DO's and Don'ts

- Easiest roguelite imo in terms of progression

Con's:

- Lack of characters
- Lack of characters costumization (appearance) since it would be nice to not be 4 cats looking exactly the same.
- Lack of content (excluding guns and scrolls) but lacking on enemies, maps, etc
- Very poor optimizationon the last map/level before area 3 final boss, all went super smooth all maps and areas but on this section all the sudden fps nose dived like a ww2 divebomber.

It's a primarily Co Op PvE First Person Shooter. It has (2 at the moment) heroes you can play as with interestingly, unique and complimentary skills.

You unlock and customize your character's potential through a 'skill card' system on each play through, picking cards (goblets) that enhance your skills, grenades, and damage - also complementing the weapons you've picked up onthis play through.

Weapons are randomized with random traits, allowing and enabling very different style of play - do you go for AoE, Elemental effects, One Hit Kills, stun/confusion, Crowd Control?

Elemental effects change the gameplay too, and combining different elements (eg shock + decay/corrosion) causes a 'new' elemental effect (Miasma/ AKA Poisionous Radiation DoT ) and mastering these is mastering the game.",1592607955,1592607955,TRUE,2,0,0.534883738,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,1753,147,8471,0,6925,1600099029,,

Then there's the English within the game, genuinely hard to understand what's being said at times, but it's not a HUGE issue and will most likely get adjusted as the devs get more feedback.
And finally the build variety, while there's plenty of guns to unlock in the game and plenty of variety therein with all the inscriptions, I do wish there were more passives to pick from in the Golden Goblet, it feels really limiting at times as most of them boil down to ""more damage for x element/skill/grenade""

66,Gunfire Reborn,71014860,english,"It was really fun learning about all the different weapons and what they do. They are very versatile and add a lot of replayability to the game with the random traits they come with.

The ascensions are a good way to perfect what you want to use. 
For example, if you use the bear character or whatever it is (forgot its name) then you will probably want to stick with explosives because most of the ascensions are for explosive weapons. 
And for the default character stick with elemental weapons (fire, lightning, corrosive). 

I feel like it is well worth the price especially if it is on sale. Hopefully, there will be content additions such as new characters, weapons, scrolls, maybe even ascensions and areas? Idk but this game is in early access so I don't see why there wouldn't be.

The only real issue with it I had is that the elite difficulty is not really harder than the normal difficulty so once you beat normal you pretty much have enough stuff to beat elite. First time I beat normal and unlocked elite I  tried it out and got all the way to the final boss on the first try and the only reason I failed was because of my poor choice of weapons (I chose a close-range fire dragon weapon that didn't have enough range to even hit the boss) but even then I still got it down to about 20% hp.

I recommend this game, but i will say that playing in multiplayer is oddly off-putting.

Once you enter multiplayer, the pacing of the game is much like that of Warframe.
You are suddenly thrusting your way through levels, you would normally find difficult.
While, in retrospect, that makes perfect sense.
In a game design aspect, it's actually extremely detrimental to the overall game feel.

Suggested Fixes:
*** If anything, please please please PLEASE update the character model to take up less space in the game world.

* Polish character movement and animations.
* Add cosmetics, for multiplayer appeal.
* More player characters
* More enemy types

You also get scrolls when playing through a run which augment your abilities. These scrolls are also all random chance of dropping with unique effects also adding onto the adaptability and freshness of each run. There are also ""golden goblets"" you find at each section of a level which augment your character in a unique way and you will have one of three random choices at each of these checkpoints. What I'm getting at if you can't tell is that each run is uniquely different which ultimately keeps me wanting to play the game more.

For some reason I don't see this comparison, maybe because Immortal Redneck was that small of a game. But imo this game and IR are both great examples of Rogue-Lite FPS games. Where Immortal Redneck stood out by the comedy style and it's movement, Gunfire Reborn stands out in its gameplay. From the guns to the characters, and the enemies, everything is polished to a very smooth degree, providing intense action in a surprisingly chilled out way.

Immortal Redneck died due to lack of support, both from players and developers. Nobody really played it, nobody really watched it, and the devs didn't have a reason to care for it despite its unique gameplay. Now Gunfire Reborn is able to succeed where it failed, I hope this gets the care that it deserves, as plankton said, ""Don't let the good die young!""

It's challenging without being unforgiving and rewarding without being stingy, as each run has a tendency to throw many weapons at you to play around with. The gunplay is traditional, but decent; there's no aiming down sights here, which honestly makes me feel a bit naked, and the game doesn't boast a whole lot of unique mechanics that separate it from something like, say, Borderlands (though it doesn't have random gun generation). But on the flip side, the weapons it offers are unique and fun to use, and the enemy design is solid enough that it turns mundane gameplay mechanics into exciting encounters. There's a bit of a balancing issue in that the second act seems to have enemies scale in difficulty exponentially, but I wonder if that's just a ""me"" problem since I don't think anybody else has complained about it.

I've seen the game be compared to Risk of Rain but to be honest I don't see any similarities at all. If.

I dont even have most of the upgrades that you can buy, so I guess I could grind and then try to carry randoms online? But whats the fun in that when most of them leave after they die anyway.

Further I hope that they will update the game with harder difficulties, and make it longer/infinite loop. 

The 25% chance on instakill (normal monsters) is also extremely busted. You could play with 4 people, and just instakill every mob you see and hardcarry the game. This % should be around 5-10% or just have a chance on execute when health is lower than 50%.

The weapons are a lot of fun and the upgrade system is meaningful without being too complex.

Some feedback for the developers, if they read these reviews:
[list]
[*] Make the damage type of the currently equipped weapon more obvious. e.g. symbols next to the weapon
[*] I'm not sure how to use Gemini mods, if they have to match both weapons and there is no additional weapons storage. You would have to give up your primary weapon, for which you probably invested ascensions. so that becomes really unattractive
[*] Run speed penalty on some weapons seems a little high
[*] Jumping challenges in the later vaults are a PITA. I actually have not been able to complete one. This could be a ""me"" problem, but maybe consider pausing the timer for a bit after entering the vault, so that players can assess the map. Start timer when the player moves

86,Gunfire Reborn,70946854,english,"It's two core design philosophies are at odds with each other. On the one hand you want to wreak havoc with all the cool and interesting weapons and see how efficiently you can mow down enemies. 

On the other the rogue lite elements mean that towards the end the majority of enemies one or two-shot you and you have to be extremely careful, hide behind cover and take potshots at the most lethal enemies. This completely stops the pacing and makes the majority of guns completely unusable. 

The issues are only amplified in co-op since enemies turn into walking tanks and unless you have a pre-formed group that knows when and how to target specific enemies it turns into a clusterfuck of chipping away at whatever enemy you can see without leaving your cover too much. 

The self-revive system is also terrible online, only one person has to pay the price of giving about 30% of their progression reward in the form of soul essences and there is no guarantee that you can revive someone, that you will finish the encounter or that the other teammates will do the same for you. So it turns into a stalemate where nobody wants to give up their admittedly precious progress for nothing because if they lose again, they are the only ones out of extra reward, the others are not.

I would very much welcome an arena style, non-rogue lite mode where you can just experience the pure gameplay for fun, with more plentiful health pickups.

12,Gunfire Reborn,70925758,english,"Let me start with I do understand why people enjoy this game for the most part it can be fun but here are a list of my gripes with it.

*Co-op is not as fun sure you can plan things with your friends but the point of a looter shooter is to just try out different guns without having to be super efficient with your friend. The enemies and bosses also have insanely increased damage and health pools. The first boss is a good example you do X amount of damage he jumps up and regens his giant shield so if it is your first run you dont learn until after he stomps you that you needed lightning damage but here is the kicker the only lightning gun you get in the beginning is not very good and the chance of you getting a different weapon that may do lightning damage can be slim. If it is single player then everything feels like a cake walk for the most part.

*If you are online and you have slight lag you can say goodbye to your health bar this still kind of applies to the co-op section.

*This is more of a gripe for me since its used to make people play certain games longer but I really am tired of the you have to die over and over to progress further into the game. Something like Monster Train you can beat on your first or second attempt but this one doesnt expect you to beat it until you are probably in the 30's. It doesn't feel like I got gud but more like I finally unlocked skills that just makes me breeze through everything.

*Dashing legit feels like trash, the parkour vault is terrible for a game that isnt really meant for it, and let me tell you about that boulder vault they never stop spawning and they spawn randomly on top of that sometimes at the exit the game likes to put flamethrower traps right at the exit so expect to die on these or just skip them in my opinion because they arent worth it unlike the kill all enemies or fight the bosses one.

Well thats over for my mini rant. I want to like this game and maybe later down the line when more things are fixed I will give it another shot. I don't regret buying it and I see the potential it has but right now it just is not for me.",1592387049,1592387049,FALSE,1,1,0.477499992,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,453,7,438,0,322,1592471978,1592446362,"Sorry for any inconvenience.

A great rougelite shooter. Guns feel satisfying and when you get going you can steamroll enemies and bosses easily. The game is a little grindy at the beginning, but it mitigates it by rewarding the player with constant new drop rewards for killing new enemy types.

30,Gunfire Reborn,70915401,english,"Great game that is easily worth the price already. I would say this game is everything I wanted from risk of rain that that game couldn't provide. There are a ton of different weapons with a huge number of unique buffs to them, lots of unique enemies, and the few worlds feel very polished and look great. The game actually rewards skillful aim with enemies having headshot (or whatever they have for a head) crits and this combined with the amount of damage you can dish out makes the game so much more enjoyable. RoR feels like an absolute chore to play for me with how little aim the game requires of you, how little damage you do to bosses, and how few options you have for unique builds builds. There is also very little in the way of dodging in risk of rain, you are mostly just completely safe while running around except for the occasional enemy that has a lock-on ability with zero counterplay other than stay near cover at all times.

Gunfire reborn on the other hand requires you to constantly be on your toes dodging quick, yet telegraphed abilities which makes it feel like you're actively learning whenever you get hit rather than the ""oh I guess I should have camped behind cover"" feeling I get from playing RoR. The cherry on top is that, unlike many other rogue-likes, it never feels like the randomness screws you over in gunfire reborn. There is enough variance that most games will play completely different, giving you different weapon and ability upgrades that all have unique playstyles.

The game isn't perfect but honestly I think the only thing I can complain about is the damn snipers, they need more of a telegraph before they do 80-100% of your hp bar. Some of the weapon projectiles feel a bit slow so it would be nice if they were sped up a bit and more hit-scan weapons were added. There isn't really a way to aim a slow projectile at an enemy that jumps somewhere else every second, though it does make some sense that weapons have different use-cases.

Just from a Suggestion point of view:
•I'd like to see level variants primarily, as the first floor gets repetitive, and in time so does the second.
•A few more guns might not hurt, but that will come in time.
•Characters, I know there is work on this so that will come, Ignore the next part just suggestions.
(I'd like to suggest two that come to mind: 1) a Turtle whoms skill is essentially a bubble shield. This would encourage the not moving scrolls as well. 2) I named him Ottis the Attack Otter, a commando otter who specializes in normal guns, Which I love but typically have no element which makes using them against bosses hard. And possibly give him like auto aim as a passive, Or possibly a healing pad situation making him into some sort of a combat medic.)

Negatives of the game I've found so far, are very few in between. There is a few Scrolls thats are just over the top, such as the level 70 scroll. and I wish that each character had an expanded hero leveling system, possibly independent of the general upgrades. But once again, this would be 

If your hesitant with purchasing this game, Don't its fantastic and its got 4 player co-op so do it up. It can only get better and overtime it may become like minecraft where the market price increases.

64,Gunfire Reborn,70901633,english,"TL;DR: BUY IT! It's awesome and well worth the money!

You'll be hard-pressed to find a better value proposition for a game at this price point. 

If you're a fan of rouguelites and/or shooters, this game is the safest bet you can make. 

In fact, despite it's aesthetic and presentation i think this game is more akin to Diablo than to Boarderlands (but i haven't played much Boarderlands so my estimation may be wrong)

Here's how the game goes: 
You play a character that has a talent tree (shared between characters so once you unlocked something for a character it is unlocked for every character, EXCEPT ascension skills)  you unlock with leveling up (fairly typical RPG progression) and special currency (every enemy drops it). The character has a primary and a secondary skill they can use (an orb and a grenade for instance). 

There are guns. Many guns. Colorful guns. Think Borderlands. You can upgrade them (damage only but i really hope they add other attributes as upgradable later on). 
There are also occult scrolls. Think of them as the artifacts in Slay The Spire. They help augment your character and refine the playstyle you want to go for. 
There are also goblets that help you build your ""spec"". Each character has different upgrades that these goblets can enable. 

The mechanics of progression are very tight and satisfying. You have a great deal of variation and synergy between the system's moving parts and hence a lot of room to explore weapon/scroll/goblet combos. If you like min-maxing, you're going to have a lot of fun figuring out how to squeeze every drop for the most bang possible.

The fights take place in arenas spread out across levels in a stage (think of a stage as a floor in Slay The Spire). So ""stage"" 1 has 5 levels with a number of arenas in them. 
Enemy variety is pretty good and boss battles are suitably tense. The last boss fight is really cool. You have difficulty modifiers to play around with if you like testing yourself against harder challenges.",1592338329,1592338951,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,256,10,3333,0,1591,1598639927,,

It's a really solid game, it's challenging, it's got decent music, and many unique enemies. The only problem is the net right now. Rubber-banding is a serious issue at the moment, whether you're solo or in a lobby. Which makes the jumping puzzle vault rooms just the worst because you're not missing the jumps because you're bad at parkour.

The best part about this game is that it doesn't try to do anything groundbreaking nor does it try to be a clone of something else. It's a simple, fun, co-op shooter/looter that, in my opinion, is definitely worth a buy. 

Kudos to the developers for actually understanding what players want and for making a great game at a reasonable price. With so many disappointing and uninspired Early Access cash-grabs out there, Gunfire Reborn is a breath of fresh air!

77,Gunfire Reborn,70895289,english,"This is  an astoundingly great game for the price point. I bought it with a friend as something to play when we were both bored and quickly became one of our favorite games for the past month. Levels are challenging and you have to be smart to survive the levels. You have to grind to get new guns and abilities which adds a level of replay. Also it is rewarding to struggle on a level and die just to come back and conquer it with new abilities and guns. This game is also ONLY EARLY ACCESS, so the fact that there is plenty more to come is highly promising. 

The only downsides are repetition and often game breaking abilities. This game doesn't have much in diverse level design. Many of the bonus stages are the same and don't really require a lot of skill to overcome. There is also a point where you can become easily overpowered with abilities. A lot of the abilities can combine where you simply take no damage, and deal obscene amounts of damage back. Now these cons are not really that big of a deal as both of them can easily be fixed by simply adding new levels, characters, and fine tuning some of the abilities to make them less over powered.

As it is in Early Access, I know critcism is hard to take seriously because any issue can be addressed the next patch. However, I think its justified for a review because the dev's are still accepting our $$$ to play.

The good:
FPS
Rogue-like
Nice progression with Weapons and Abilities for first 2-3 hours.
Crisp models, animations, and gunplay
Sounds
Boss-fights

The bad:
Enemy variety
Progression after the initial playthroughs (~level 15)
Map repetition*

*This is the most heinous problem. It kills the feeling of progression because you face the exact same rooms with the exact same enemies. The only variety is what you get from a reward at the end of the room and where ""secret rooms"" spawn (but then the secret rooms are repeated every run). Even the placement of that reward is the exact same. I look to other looter games comparison and this seems like a no-no (RoR2, Borderlands, IR).

In Conclusion:

Unfortunately for me, a rogue-like fps needs to have an interactive environment. If that comes via extreme player mobility or through more map variety, I would be happy. But as it stands there is none. Even the rewards in older rogue-like games are more interactive than this game (think FTL, a game that has very little map variety).

It's a nice enough diversion for some hours but no serious competition to Risk of Rain. There are no interesting enemies, only 3 maps and 2 heroes, the sole replayability stems from random boons and weapon mods. 
During EA there is certainly time to boost the content, however it would have to be an rather unusual achievement to get anywhere near RoR with its multitude of characters (8 so far I think), varied maps, cool enemies (more than the standard melee, ranged and exploders) and plethora of items.

34,Gunfire Reborn,70868620,english,"This game is really well designed. My favorite aspect of it is how every weapon is viable. The starting hero is mainly focused on elemental weapons with a skill tree that powers them up whilst providing some crowd control with their skill, while the second character is focused on explosive weapons and a more aggressive playstyle. While not buffing elemental weapons directly, the second character is able to make use of elemental combos like miasma (corrosive and shock I believe) with his ability, making it feel really great to realize new build choices. 

Overall, the game's progression is fairly linear with three different area themes each with their own unique set of enemies. The second area is a clear jump in difficulty from the first, while the third is more easily dealt with given the power you have accrued once you get to it.  

If I were to give one criticism with the game, it is that it can feel repetitive since the number of unique enemies is fairly low with each area, maybe 5-7 unique enemies (rough estimate). Because of that and the fact that the bosses are the exact same each run, the game can feel a little dry. Although the enemies and areas are repetitive, the build variety makes up for it as it is very satisfying and easy to understand given enough time to master it (which isn't that long). 

Before I end this review, I have to say that another stellar aspect of this game is the gunplay. Gunfire Reborn is a first person shooter, so it does require a certain degree of aim. There are many weapons, including shotguns, bows, rocket launchers, submachine guns, assault rifles, and other more unique guns. Some are much easier to aim than others, but at the end of the day, the gunplay feels very satisfying, responsive, and fun. I highly recommend the game to anyone looking for difficulty, satisfying gunplay, and a variety of build options that allow high replayability.",1592284327,1592284327,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,61,2,1069,0,623,1592695674,,

Be warned though that you need to have a good ping to play it effectively; playing it with a friend in Croatia and the boss AoE prompts that warn you to GTFO are shown so late (and the game assumes your position to be behind where you actually are for them, feels like) that it's VERY difficult to dodge.

- Great controls on controller (speaking only for controller as I do not enjoy mouse and keyboard)
- Sound effects and music are very nice, music is pleasant without being distracting

Cons:
- Biggest issue I have right now is lack of ironsights. Not being able to ironsight with a weapon lacking a scope is just...baffling. It makes aiming some weapons difficult and would love if the weapon does not have an alt-fire if they could be ironsighted.
- Minor translation errors (these are not that big of a deal) but what is a big deal is lack of detail about some features, aside from loading screen tips, a lot of important info just doesn't seem available like what elements create what effects or if a scroll that removes an ability can be countered by a perk that improves that ability
- Lack of playable characters. After 25+ hours of gameplay I am...rather bored of the dog and cat, and from the loading screen I can see the next hero may be a bird and I would GREATLY enjoy playing a new hero. But again, early access, so I know those will come eventually.

Suggestions going forward?
- Color options for heroes, maybe some accessory unlocks so when playing and all 4 people are Crown Prince there can be some way to stand out.
- More heroes! The bird, maybe a reptile and a fish to round out the roster!",1592280775,1592280775,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,293,13,2977,185,1590,1601557579,,

2. This first boss is absolute B.S. there is no reason why the first boss should be nearly impossible to defeat unless you have a full team of players that are level 20+
3. After you miraculously manage to beat the first boss, you should not have to go through the same old dungeon with the same old enemies and the same old final boss just to get to the second stage again. It comes back to the lack of progression.

The abilities and progression - both in and out of run - are well implemented with enough depth to make each run varied.
The game requires a little balancing and some of the translation is a bit off (the dev team are from Hong Kong but have now enlisted help with localisation) but these are really minor issues which I'm confident will be ironed out during early access. The dev team seem very communicative and receptive to community feedback.
Performance can be a sticking point in early access games for me, but I've got no issues here. Running on ultra 1080p i'm getting really smooth feeling minimum 130fps - except for late game on elite mode, where it dips to 80-90 - with just a 1060 6gb and haven't experienced any game breaking bugs or crashes.
Overall I haven't been this impressed with an early access game since Slay The Spire. It's well worth the cost of entry and I think it'll evolve into one of the best games in the roguelike genre.",1592220263,1592245986,TRUE,1,0,0.506726444,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,261,5,1762,0,1150,1597952072,,

9,Gunfire Reborn,70829719,english,"I was thinking about reviewing this game at an earlier time, but I wanted to at least unlock and play the second character before I did so. That happened, so here we go-

I love both genres this game utilizes, being FPS and Rogue-lite. When I had first seen this game, I was super excited. I've played a good amount of it now, and there's are certain things I want to mention.

For the positives, I really like the game's polish, the graphics are pretty neat, and there's definitely a decent amount of weapons to have fun with. In terms of sole positives, that's where I'm ending it.

Now it gets a bit more gray. The gameplay loop is satisfying at times, yet frustrating at others. The characters' abilities get extremely boring(especially the first character) and it leaves me WANTING some variance there. And once you keep playing more and more, you can easily get bored of the environments. Nothing really changes in the places you've been (and keep going to), and it starts to become un-fun in the earlier parts. 

Bringing into account this is early access, I have high hopes for the game's future, and want to drop some of my own recommendations down for it: 1. Variety in character abilities. The game is begging for it. 2. Possibly having things change/unlocking new parts of previously exhausted environments. Think Dead Cells, maybe have some different paths leading into different sections with different enemies and bosses? Or, if anything, different bosses per boss level that have different chances of spawning. 3. The game can definitely use 1, if not 2, more characters. The replayability would definitely benefit from more characters.

Essentially, to not make this longer: I want to see new, different content to allow variations per playthrough/run, so as to not make it feel the same every time. Definitely a chance to get inspired from other Rogue-lites, there's no shame in that if you ask me.",1592231585,1592231585,TRUE,1,0,0.512325823,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,371,20,907,0,466,1597942947,,

- As for an alpha, I have not run into much bugs at the moment

- Has a lot of replayability as you are progressing
- Has an official discord server so you can ask questions if you are confused about anything.

Cons:
- Will get boring after you complete the game (unlock everything, max level, etc.)
- Damage numbers can obscure your view which can get pretty annoying
- You can't ping/typing system implemented yet

40,Gunfire Reborn,70811563,english,"TL;DR:
In its current form, don't bother with this game. But it has a lot of potential, so I hope the devs continue work

Long version:

Movement in this game is very poorly done. It feels extremely stiff and unrewarding. Contrary to games like team fortress 2 that blend rewarding movement with rewarding guns, I would say this game has neither of those paradigms pinned just yet. From the get-go the game breaks the flow with overbearing tutorial elements that stop the gameplay and immediately frustrate players. The further on you go the more you will find enemies with tracking projectiles, otherwise known as the lazy-man's solution to making reasonable opponents to fight and good AI, which remove  a significant volume of the reward to using the mechanics of the game.

My next point is the guns and sound design. The sound impact of hitting a headshot is good, however almost all other aspects are not very telling. You cannot tell by sound if there is a threatening enemy around, it's difficult and confusing to read the environmental and combat sounds from eachother. This could be fixed by making higher contrast sounds, heavy thumps and unique noises for each enemy. The guns can all be improved by better sounds, effects and ""impact"" from hitting enemies. Faster projectile speed, better reactions from enemies like simulated strafing or dashing towards you without providing too heavy a ""punish"" damage.

My final point is the visual language of the game.

The art design is phenomenal, I can't say it could be better by much. However the visual language of the game is very confusing. Why do we have all these cartoony enemies, then beetles, then giant humanoid like enemies and horse-headed figurines all that don't stand out exceptionally well or point themselves out from the environment? 

As someone who likes to play competitive shooters, I can clear an entire dungeon with just the default weapon fine. Why? In a lot of cases it's not even faster to use the pickup weapons. The visual language of the game is very confusing, enemies aren't made more dangerous based on colour and they strain the eyes to pick them out from the environment. Hitboxes are very clear at least. The boss that I encoutered at the very least felt very lazy, they just made something with a lot of HP, slow movement and a lot of damage. Contrast this to the Marauder from Doom Eternal, who doesn't have an exceptionally high volume of HP but forces you to rely on timing to apply damage, and you can really see what I mean by lazy. Everyone HATED the marauder but LOVED to beat him. It was extremely rewarding.

And my final point:
This game has a lot of potential. But it needs a lot of work, please buy it and provide input for the developers so they can turn this clear labour of love into something great.",1592196830,1592196830,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,222,2,261,0,48,1592368351,,

From the guns to the characters, and the enemies, everything is polished to a very smooth degree, providing intense action in a surprisingly chilled out way. 

Immortal Redneck died due to lack of support, both from players and developers. Nobody really played it, nobody really watched it, and the devs didn't have a reason to care for it despite its unique gameplay.

It's really really not. There are certainly mechanics that are similar to many other games in orthogonal genres, but Gunfire Reborn puts them together in a really cohesive and addicting way.

It has the roguelike elements of Dead Cells, the gameplay feel of Borderlands (but better), and the randomization / artifact mechanics of Risk of Rain 2 or (believe or not) Monster Train. I found myself engrossed in the decision making of dynamically choosing weapons based on build ideas, and then proving them out over the course of a run. I find this learning loop to be extremely rewarding.

I will point out that by far the strongest element of Gunfire Reborn is the actual gunplay. I can't recall a single game with as tight, responsive, and rewarding single player FPS mechanics as this one.

The core gameplay is enjoyable, with a number of interesting weapons to mess around with and a fair few scrolls which give you interesting passive bonuses. It's also much more enjoyable in multiplayer. Loot is instanced, but you can drop most weapons/scrolls to share with you allies complimenting their builds.

The main gripe I have is the lack of area and enemy variety. You'll always be fighting your way through the same areas, repeating the same rooms with the same enemies often, and facing the exact same bosses every time at the end of each area. There are also only 2 playable characters, they do feel different from each other and can each be played in a couple of different ways.

The replay value currently comes from the rouguelite progression, where you can upgrade your character permanently at the end of each run. You'll also unlock additional weapons and scrolls for completing challenges. These will appear in future runs and even drop one for you to try out immediately which is a nice feature.

Bearing all this in mind, the game is currently in early access. The developers seem to be updating the game regularly, fixing many initial bugs and adjusting systems. For example, they recently added an alternative way to revive dead allies besides just reaching the next area. I've played a fair amount and may stop playing once beating the final boss (on normal difficulty), or possibly beforehand until they've added more features. If you're on the fence, I'd pick it up and try it out especially with a friend. Otherwise wait until they add more areas, bosses and playable characters.",1592143999,1592143999,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,367,3,1508,0,847,1598019977,,

[h1]Overview[/h1] 
An amazing FPS rougelike that is reminiscint of Borderlands. The game has solid mechanics and a great foundation. To join the annuls of greatness, more content will be necessary to increase the variety so the game feels less samey at times.

[h1]Game Breakdown[/h1]
[h3] Gameplay 🎮[/h3]
 
[u]Characters[/u]
At the beginning of the game the player only has one character to choose from, but at the moment there are two to choose from. To unlock the second character, the player needs to invest in the progression system which will be covered later. Each character has the ability to dash, but they both have different grenades and a unique super ability. The first character is known as The Prince. He is a samurai cat who focuses elemental effects and his unique skill is Energy Orb. While the name is certainly unassuming its effect is quite potent. Energy orb deals a burst of damage and freezes enemies in time. The prince’s grenade releases a poison gas that damages and slows enemies that stand in it. They are both quite enjoyable abilities that can be used both offensively and defensively. The Prince is also the most balanced character in terms of shields and heath, as well as offensive and defensive options. Shields regenerate after not taking damage for a short while which contrasts with health which is only recovered with special health restoring items. The second character is Ao Bai who is a dog that has dual wielding as his super skill. Unlike The Prince, Ao Bai has low shields and high health, much higher than The Prince. This makes him tankier, but it is harder for him to recover his resources that help him defy death. Ao Bai’s grenade is a simple explosive grenade. Ao Bai is my favorite character because of the crazy dual wielding combos that can be achieved, but he is a high-risk and high reward kind of character. His only defensive ability is the fact that he will likely kills enemies before they kill him. This makes him more difficult but still really fun. I am excited to see what kind of characters the developers come up with next.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2127837215

[u]Ascension[/u]
Characters’ abilites don’t stay static, as that would be boring. After a level is completed, the player is able to choose from three different ability upgrades. One such example for each character would be gaining Energy Orb charges on The Prince and throwing two grenades at no additional cost for Ao Bai. Powers are diverse, with there being eight in each category. Most power upgrades also have three levels that provide a huge bonus if level three is achieved.

[u]Weaponry[/u]
The weapons in this game are crazy, but they are also inspired by guns in other games as well. One gun allows you to throw it as a grenade which is quite similar to the Tediore gun manufacturer in Borderlands. The guns are diverse enough to not get boring, and this is further compounded by the fact that each weapon discovered comes with randomized inscriptions which apply various bonuses. These range from simple increased in crit damage, while one unique modifier I found gave my gun an extra shot in its one round magazine and if the first shot didn’t kill, the second shot got an extreme crit called a Lucky Shot in this game. 
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2127836297

[u]Enemies[/u]
Considering this game is in early access Gunfire Reborn has a great variety of enemies for each of three biomes to combat. One thing that really surprised me was that enemy AI is pretty smart and uses cover really effectively. Short enemies will crouch next to cover to keep from getting shot. Other enemies would dodge roll at times. 

[u]Status Effects[/u]
There are three status effects in the game which are decay, fire, and shock. Decay is essentially poison and it slows in addition to dealing damage. Fire just deals damage over time. Shock deals damage but can allow a shot to jump to another enemy. These status effects are pretty typical, except for the act that they can combine if applied simultaneously to an enemy. For example, shock and fire turns into manipulation which makes an enemy shoot at its own allies. This system is interesting and makes some of the weaker guns with elemental effects useful.

[u]Occult Scrolls[/u]
Occult scrolls upgrade the player’s character with passive effects. They are a rouglelike standard and are gained mainly by defeating vault challenges. They are powerful, but interestingly often come with drawbacks.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2127836649

[u]Shops[/u]
There are two shop types. The peddler sells guns, healing items, ammo, and the occasional occult scroll. The blacksmith improves guns with more damage and additional inscriptions.

[u]Progression[/u]
After a run is finished, whether it is a win or one of the many losses the player is able to use the soul essence gained by killing enemies to permanently improve heroes. While most of them are generic, there is a small skill line that is hero specific that further improves their specialty.

[h3]📚 Story & Translation 📚[/h3]
The story involves stopping some sort of corruption, but besides the beginning cutscene, this story is not brought up much afterward. The translation is one of this game’s weaknesses, as at the time of writing it isn’t especially great.

[h3]🎧 Sound 🎧[/h3]
The sound design is great in both the music and the sound effect departments. The music’s most notable aspect is its heavy use of a bass drum to create a strong sense of hype while the player lays ruin to their opponents. The sound effects for each gun and each enemy helps to give auditory feedback that allows for a quick dodge just in time or a well-placed shot that creates more kiting space.

[h3]📺 Graphics 📺 [/h3]
the graphics remind me of would be cel-shaded games except without the black borders. I would also liken the graphics a bit to Legend of Zelda Windwaker, due to their bright color scheme with stumpy character design. Every shot from enemies was easily recognizable as well which made it easier to know which could be ignored and which should be dodged.

[h3]⌨ Controls ⌨[/h3]
The controls are the typical FPS ones.

37,Gunfire Reborn,70776500,english,"So, to get my bias out in the open: i love roguelikes that have perma-upgrades. So, Gunfire reborn falls right into that niche for me.

More objectivly (Note: all of the below apply to the game in early access)

Pros
+Decent weapon diversity + random affixes mean most weapons can be viable
+Two characters feel mechanically different
+Online multiplayer in a early access game that actually works (Still has hiccups, but given that its EA, I am just impressed that it works at all)
+Interesting flavor backdrop for gameplay
+Game is only 12 USD, which is super cheap.

Cons
-Dog character seems less useful than cat (Though I could just be bad with the dog)
-Enemy HP scaling makes late game a slog if your build is done improperly.
-Elemental Fusions/Combos are almost mandatory vs just shooting more
-Game still short

Conclusion
Almost all the negatives are things I expect from an early access game, and that will (Should?) be fixed over time. Give the game a try.",1592140633,1592140633,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,795,19,2567,0,722,1599882147,,

39,Gunfire Reborn,70774169,english,"An actual great game. Has the chance of becoming one of the best roguelites ever if the devs keep this up. Using borderlands weapon elements (corrosive, shock, and burning) and adding extra elements to them (shock effect deals shock damage to nearby enemies, corrosive slows, and burning dots), as well as combining them to enable even more powerful combos, shock + corrosive = miasma for instance, makes for a fun experience to try different weapons together and can make some crazy builds. Unlocks are through playing the game and using new combinations of weapons on enemies, such as killing a specific enemy with a specific element/element effect on them. You gain levels by using the essence you gain to upgrade talents, which allows you to unlock more things like the 2nd character, and other powers you can find. 

Through levels you can find vaults that have a small challenge before a chest that will reward you with a scroll, that grants usually a downside, but a big positive as well, or just a positive ie: -90% dmg taken from enemies far, but +90% dmg taken from enemies nearby (positive and a negative). Sometimes you'll stumble across a gold chest that will offer different things, taking damage to gain money, or permanent max shield/hp as an example. At the end of levels you will find a chest that gives a goblet that will offer you one of three choice of upgrades to your character or their skills, such as increasing the amount of damage a specific element does, or modifying your unique ability.

The game is a bit short, but it makes up for this with strong enemies, tanky or high damaging, as well as unique and fun boss fights. I do wish they had a looping mode like risk of rain does, but overall I am satisfied by the end of the game.

Overall, I love this game, and as I said this has the chance of being an absolute breakthrough (not that isnt already) and the best roguelite shooter in the market. It is definitely worth the $12 and I'd heavily recommend it for people that enjoy roguelikes and shooters.",1592137264,1592137264,TRUE,1,0,0.523809552,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,145,1,2575,21,1298,1602017026,,

58,Gunfire Reborn,70760546,english,"Gunfire Reborn, even as an early access game, has a heaping amount of work and heart poured into it.  At nearly 40 hours into this game and about a week or so of playing, I still a ton left to unlock, master, and learn from this game.

Many reviews will say similar things: it is a roguelite with elements of borderlands (presentation, gun randomness, hp type division) doom's gameplay loop (fight one room at a time, different enemies and your weapon load out will determine how go about clearing a room, and a dash that can enable skillful gameplay with dodging and positioning), and the randomness of things like dead cells or risk of rain (stages fought in a certain order, spending money post-run on global progression upgrades, unlock guns/scrolls by accomplishing objectives while playing).  It is built from the ideas of many, but comes together in a great package of its own.

This all builds into a game where you're constantly on the move, analyzing which enemies to fight, how to best deal with them on your current build, and think about what you want next to ensure you will continue your run.  The second difficulty, Elite, is quite challenging at later levels, and you almost always need to feel broken before you can consider beating the last boss.

Of course, the game is in early access, so there are a few issues.  Balance is a bit iffy right now; a few guns are almost auto-pick, while some are literally irredeemable trash.  There are only 3 stages, and you always fight them in the same order, boss and all.  There's only two characters, which are fun in their own ways, but not quite as unique as many similar games.  The grammar is confusing and terminology sometimes unclear, due to the game being translated not quite as well as you'd hope, but about as well as you'd expect from an indie game.  Several mechanics of the game are unclear and only found through random loading screen tips, which—if you run this on an SSD like I do—makes them often quite hard to read in time.

Despite all of that, the gameplay loop is fantastic.  As a huge fan of Risk of Rain, this game really scratches that same itch.  The sheer variety of guns, abilities, and interactions in this game is wild, making broken combinations you again and again don't realize the strength of until you see them melt enemies in a second.  Truly, if you like roguelite games and tight fps mechanics, pick this up.

81,Gunfire Reborn,70749528,english,"Wonderful roguelike FPS. Always coming back to chase that ""perfect"" build. 

Really clever combo of class-based skill progression along with the standard buffs, where you always want to try your hardest to align the two into OP combos. Based on what you get, this can totally change up the way your trying to build your character halfway through a run.

Crisp toon-style gunplay, lots of unique weapons, elements, enemy variety (some of whom you'll quickly learn to respect...), cool bosses, challenge areas, just so much variety to make every run feel a little different. 

The zones and pacing of the game feel really good. Compared to something like RoR2, where the game flows from empty/boring to over the top, Gunfire has a more consistent pace that I find refreshing, along with a tight campaign and a finite end. 

Each run rewards you with currency to spend on a meta progression tree. Normally I'd feel a little turned off by this, but here it lends to making your gameplay feel totally different over time.  Yes, you are generally just more OP as you level up, but this also unlocks new playstyles that don't really work at the earlier ranks. This coupled with the system where you unlock new potential scrolls (buffs) into your future loot tables makes for a pretty interesting and satisfying meta progression. And they have these sort of ""save slots"" where you can start a fresh progression on a new slot. I did this when playing with a buddy who was new to the game, and I was once again met with a brutally punishing early game that I had already forgotten about. Leveling up all over again was surprisingly fun.

99,Gunfire Reborn,70744291,english,"This game is incredible. Simply put.

If you need more to go on, I'll elaborate. To start, this game is in Early Access, but I've got 54.4 hours as of writing—there is just so much to work towards. The sense of progression is rather fast especially as you're learning how the game works (read the loading screen tips, everyone!), and is accelerated in co-op. I can't honestly comment on how well co-op works given that my internet stability tends to be...questionable. For the most part, it's pretty stable, even when you're connected to someone else's lobby, but I've had terrible connections too, even as the host. 

Enemy variety is considerable, and their attack patterns can f*ck you up quickly, even on normal difficulty. The boss fight feel appropriately like boss fights—they're huge, they have attack patterns to learn, and you're locked in an arena with them. You will learn to fear Lu Wu, the very first boss, too.

There are two playable characters as of this moment, but the best one is accessible from the very start (make no mistake, having a natural way of inflicting elemental effects on enemies to combo with your weapons makes you feel like a monster). Speaking of weapons...the sheer number of weapons...good Lord, the SHEER. NUMBER. Granted, it's not a super-insane number yet, but the game's theme allows for a lot of room for weapon and perk variety, similar to Borderlands ( sans perks). Yeah, I brought it up. I'm sure many others have, but it's reasonably valid to. Weapons drop from enemies and can be bought from a vendor who occasionally appears as you travel. In co-op, weapons that drop seem to be instanced at random, meaning there are times when you get drops that others on your team can't see. I'm not sure how many others have had this experience, but I've seen it happen enough to know this is the case (this might be restricted solely to drops of weapons that others may not have unlocked yet, now that I think about it...).

A final word about weapon drops, once you've picked over the things you don't want, pick up the stuff you don't want and then drop it, that way it becomes visible to your teammates. And for the hell of it, do the same for occult scrolls you don't want—it might fit into someone else's build.

Right now, the devs are focused on the stability of the player experience (including co-op things such as connection stability and resurrection methods), but I have little doubt that there is content to come.

Gunfire Reborn is a rogue-like first person shooter game. The main gist of the game is, your abilities, power ups and weapons are upgraded through scrolls and goblets, which are placed in chests spread throughout each level. The levels themselves change layout every time you start a new session, and the game lasts as long as you stay alive. Once your lives and revives are wiped out, you must start from the beginning.

After every run of the game, you use your collected 'Soul Essence' to upgrade a skill tree. These skills range from increased ammo capacity to more shield and health, and even unlock new features such as better weapon augmentations or the ability to choose a weapon right at the beginning of a new session. Each upgrade costs more Soul Essence, and the longer you last within each level, the more will drop from enemies and bosses until you die.

The bosses... as of the typing of this review, I and several friends have only made it past the first boss. What you can expect from these bosses is a heavy challenge. Whether you play alone or in a group, the boss will stack their health and shield to match the amount of players in your party. There will be mobs that get summoned in. There will be cover that can be broken. There will be attacks you absolutely have to avoid to survive. The challenge is fresh and welcome.

Gunfire Reborn is a Roguelike / FPS. Kind of like a lovechild of Risk of Rain and Borderlands. It utilities procedurally generated levels. Randomized gun loot from a vast armory, with a plethora of stats and effects. A permanent talent tree system that improves with every run you finish and a reward system just for playing!

The gameplay feels very fluid and the feedback from combat is great, sound effects and coloured text from scoring ""crits"". (Think headshots / weakpoints from Borderlands) and ""lucky shots"" (Think critical hits from RPG's such as Final Fantasy etc), along with the potential of elemental damage and explosives to add to the chaos, still allows you to clearly understand what hit what and for how much. The sheer amount of weaponry for a game this early in development is fantastic and the starting gun feels solid, even later into a run should you run out of ammo, as it is also constantly upgraded with your other weapons so it doesn't fall behind and become useless.

While the game does use randomly generated maps, the sample size of the room tiles available is still very small, so you tend to face the same 5-8 rooms, level dependent, in a random order, rather than feeling that each run is truly unique. Once you have taken the talent to open secret 'vaults' around the map, which can include battle arenas, jumping puzzles or trap-ridden treasure rooms, while in execution, are very fun and rewarding, are also doomed to being predictable and repetitive after the first few runs.

The randomness of the weaponry available to the player, is one of my favorite things about this game. Firstly the weapons themselves vary from Submachine-guns to Miniguns to Kunai to even a lizard that spits fireballs! The bonus stats, or 'inscriptions' can range from anything to increasing your mag size, reload speed or even changing the damage type of the weapon to a new element. Early into my time spent playing, I wrote off a lot of the earlier guns as 'useless' until I'd progressed down the talent tree and unlocked 'exclusive inscriptions' which can make a weapon vastly more powerful, or even change the way it functions completely. Players will also come across various 'occult scrolls' which will empower the player and truly bring the uniqueness of each run. These powers can make, or break a run and it feels amazing when you think you've found ""the build"". Alas, sometimes power comes with a handicap for example, some of the scrolls will bring you power at a cost, so it's down the the playstyle of the individual to make up their mind with what fits.

The game consists at time of review of 2 playable characters. 'Crown Prince' who is unlocked initially and 'Ao Bai' who is unlocked once you have reached level 30. Crown Prince has an ability that fires an orb, dealing damage and freezing enemies in place for couple of seconds, and gas grenades that deal DoT corrosive damage to enemies, Ao Bai's ability is to dual-wield both of your equipped guns, their grenade deals instant explosive damage. Both characters share the same starting weapon and talent tree. Crown Prince's permanent upgrades seem to change the way their ability works such as freezing enemies for longer, dealing more damage or mastering one of the elements, whereas Ao Bai's upgrades seem to utilise explosive damage, both from weapons and his own grenades and making himself more formidable while their dual-wield ability is active.

The talent tree is the main progression point of the game, shared between both characters (with the exception of a small 5-point strip on the right hand side which is unique to each character). This will permanently boost your power and make subsequent runs easier. Providing boosts to health, shield, reducing the damage you take, increasing the damage you do and even making it easier to revive your allies in co-op mode. While in a run you are granted 'Soul Essence' for defeating enemies and bosses, which is used in turn to power up the Jade Amulet given to you by your master. Whilst in a run, upon death you can also sacrifice some of the soul essence you have collected to revive yourself once.

Whilst the progression might sound quite grindy, the game is so fun and engaging and doesn't even feel like you're trying to grind. Being rewarded for playing with new unlocks such as weapons and ascension scrolls adds replayability and though you may not take down the boss this time, you could set a smaller goal of trying to take down as many required enemies as possible to grant yourself a new power or weapon. All the unlocks are available to view on the main menu with the means to do so, as well as a bestiary.

This game can be played solo or Co-Op with up to 3 friends. I believe it uses Steam P2P, so connection issues can depend on who's hosting. While I have experienced a few issues with co-op play such as rubber banding and latent hit registry, It's been nothing game breaking such as falling out of the world or desync. One of my main issues at the moment is I feel it's a little overtuned, especially on normal difficulty. Using the first boss as an example in single player he has 80,000hp. In 2 player this is raised threefold to 240,000hp and in 3 player it is raised fivefold to 400,000hp. Also if you should happen to die after using your revival in Co-Op you're doomed to sitting watching your friends/allies play without you for up to 4 stages as you are not revived until after the boss is defeated, missing out not only on gameplay but also the rewards required to meet the hike in difficulty for each stage.

[b]TL:DR[/b]
Gunfire Reborn is a Roguelike FPS that shows great potential. It's fluid and fun although somewhat repetitive. Lots of weapons and skills in a randomised loot system, rewarding gameplay and lots of replayability. In terms of game for the price, especially as this is an early access title, it's excellent quality. The game is being updated regularly and every update seems to make the game better. If you like FPS and dungeon crawlers, or are just looking for something to kill the time either alone or with friends, definitely give this title a go.

Combat is satisfying, the general speed of play is perfect, and weapons have a nice 'chunk' to them. All up the game loop feels very refined. Devs are very active as well, which is encouraging.

Unfortunately, there's a limited amount of actual content and it therefore gets repetitive very quickly. Mobs are mostly archers, grenade chuckers and the occasional swordsman all the way through to the final boss. Despite the procedural generation, the layouts all feel more or less identical and the scenery doesn't really change, it's all generic dungeon rough-hewn granite in a couple of different pastel shades.

I'm also a little disappointed in the end of run levelling up. The bonuses are all generic (eg +5 ammo cap) and the grind more or less ends up meaning that you buy everything across the board rather than focussing on a particular speciality or ability.

In the end the game is a soft thumbs up for me. The price point is appropriate and I am hopeful that there's a fair bit more content, and iteration, to come, but I've been burned by early access games at this stage of the development cycle before.

61,Gunfire Reborn,70719883,english,"A cute little rougelite first person shooter, somewhat like borderlands with the guns that are dropped.

One grind every ""run"" to get a little stronger and get further, same time i think it gets a little harder too, but you get stronger faster, i think.

Allot of a ""run"" ofc depends on what ""gear""(my description) scrolls and what upgrade skills one chooses during a map, and what guns one decide to grab, hopefully one can get some synergy with it all and go FAR.
But at the end of the map, when one die, one can spend the SPECIAL currency from the defeated foes on getting the char you played, a bit stronger for the next run.

Art is cute, nothing fantastic, but i have seen WAAY worse out there, for way less.
There are some rng in the maps i think, but the first level one really gets to know well, as there are no guarantee to even get to ""floor"" 2.

Perhaps later there will be a system to skip the first level, perhaps there are one that you unlock after getting up in levels already.
You are probably going to get a bit sick of the first floor eventually.
But it is still fun.
Getting better and smarter yourself helps enormusly naturally, so it is not all rng.

Co op seems a heck of allot of fun, and allot of the guns (and some skills i guess) seem to work best with two people geting more stats on enemies and by that doing way more damage, 
But i have no problem enyoing it myself solo.
Sure it can be a bit harder solo, and perhaps not qite as fun, but i find it plenty fun even solo.
The maps scale, so do not expect a cake walk just because you are two people.

IF my memmory do not decive me, i THINK it is up to 4 people co op, have yet to see that, but i would imagin allot of fun to be had.

94,Gunfire Reborn,70707964,english,"I considered writing this review a day ago.  I had two hours of gametime and now at the time of writing this I have 3.  I can tell you that I was going to recommend this game even in its current state.  

I started out the game feeling like it was slow.  The character seemed slow to get around even though the first stage maps are small to begin with.  Enemies are varied and can surprise you but after a few rounds you learn the attacks and the timings.  You will die very quickly and easily in the beginning.  And I didn’t quite understand in the beginning that this game has serious ramp.  It goes like this:

You start out with 0 talent.  Literally and metaphorically.  You don’t know the moves of enemies to dodge them and you have no literal in game talent to earn new perks.  As you play and lose you will earn “talent” which is used to unlock perks which begin the “ramping” process.  You see at first you will feel like a piece of s*** dying easily and not finding great weapons.  I thought that this was the game.
Its not.  You see eventually you’ll gain the ability to unlock better weapon drops, more variation, better affects and so on.  And all the while you’re getting better drops more often for guns, you’re now also getting more scrolls.  

Scrolls are the wonderful mutators in this game akin to RoRs items.  They change your abilities and give you enhanced powers.  For example, I love the advanced jogger pants because it makes so that I can dodge with a 2 second cool down.  Partner that with the scroll that makes it so that 35% of the time your abilities don’t trigger a cooldown at all, and you suddenly have a good chance of double or triple dashing on the regular.
Now suddenly a stage that took 30 minutes and a guaranteed death at boss is completed in less than half that time and the boss is a cakewalk.  And it’s so satisfying.  Unfortunately, this game is somewhat brutal in a sense that as soon as you reach a new stage that is completely fresh  you are guaranteed to die from an unknown threat announcing itself.  

I generally don’t buy early access games anymore unless they are very far along in development.  So this one was sort of a gamble for me because it seems very new.  For $12 USD however this is a really hard game to not recommend.  Hell even if they were charging $20 I’d still be recommending it.

Bottom line is: Repetitive learn/adapt gameplay, combined with borderlands guns, and risk of rain items makes for an extremely fun game.  Add some coop seasoning and interesting and distinct art visuals for flavor and this is just a really great deal and a great game.  I look forward to seeing its development.",1592027088,1592027120,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,278,23,324,0,228,1600489324,,

1,Gunfire Reborn,70700054,english,"Very good dungeon crawler with a combination of elements from Doom, Borderlands, Hades, Risk of Rain, Dead Cells, and a few other greats. Unfortunately at the time of writing this the game suffers from extreme balancing issues both for and against the player. For example:

- Usefulness of guns vary extremely between the types of guns. Only about 4 out of the 30+ guns in the game are good at all
- Gun modifiers are very overpowered, where some can give you a 1/4 chance to one-shot when headshotting, and others giving you your ammo back if you miss
- Ground troops are quite weak. In comparison to Doom where the small grunts are easy kills and the bigger ones are each their own challenge, in Gunfire there are about 2 troop variations out of ~8 available per stage are any threat. With the right weapon they almost all get one-shot.
- Corrosive element is severely unbalanced. It slows for ~70% movement speed and lasts a good 8 seconds even after being unaffected. On top of this is deals DoT to the player, or the enemy. This leaves the other two elements, fire and lightning, to be completely shadowed by corrosive damage as fire on does DoT and lightning is useless. 

In light of these flaws I judge a game off of its potential in EA. As this game is fairly new I will see past these issues and trust the devs to see to rebalancing as the development cycle progresses. Where this game wins my heart is the other parts that I love. Gunplay is crisp, responsive, and rewarding. Headshot pings and kill response is absolutely beautiful. The item progression is great (imo) in comparision to a game such as Risk of Rain. Where in other games, gaining items are flat upgrades with no depth behind them, this game has quite a few double-edged swords when it comes to upgrading. This leaves the player to pay attention to what they are building, whether it be utility, sustain, or aggregate damage. On top of this the game just came out and they are roadmapping tons of new content to come that I can say I am excited for.",1592010407,1592021993,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,137,17,3328,0,1041,1597892202,,

67,Gunfire Reborn,70682644,english,"This game is basically perfect. It promises an FPS RPG Rogue Lite and it definitely delivers. The art style is amazing, but it is worth mentioning that many things in this game were clearly inspired by Overwatch and other games. There's a big fat shark enemy that hooks you with an anchor just like Roadhog. There's a gun that's basically a direct rip of Zarya's gun when wearing the Viking skin. In the same vein, there's a giant sword/shield wielding enemy that was clearly inspire by the knights in Zelda's Wind Waker, and I also wouldn't be surprised if the desert coyote was inspired by Jolteon. It's the same color, of a similar style and attacks with yellow lightning. It's kind of up to you to decide if coping so many other designs in gaming is lazy or not, but do try and remember this is a $13 game when judging it's overall creativity. 

Coping your friends homework, but changing it enough to not be plagiarism aside, this game is definitely worth the price when not on sale, which is more than I can say about a lot of the games I've played recently. 

The weapons are varied and there's basically something there for everyone. For a while I was a bit annoyed that some of the guns are objectively bad, but the game flips this on its head by allowing you to earn money with crit hits. All of a sudden the really poopy SMGs are great money makers for getting through the first dungeon, which at this point should be really easy to finish. I really like this mechanic, because the issue with Rogue lites is the early floors often get so easy and you've already been through there so many times you just wish you could skip it. This game does a decent job of avoiding that by allowing you to breeze through the level while also raking in coin. 

Aside from the variety, the majority of the weapons also look really cool. THERE'S A TINY DRAGON YOU USE AS A FLAME THROWER AND TO RELOAD IT FLIES AROUND IN YOUR PALM. 

What I'm saying is this game has great flavor, a great sense of progress, and solid FPS combat. The level design is probably the weakest part of the game. After all the brightly colored weapons and energy blasts, the dungeon and the desert levels just feel bland by comparison. Only the third area ""The Beach"" really lives up to what the level design could have been. 

Considering this game is in Alpha, I'm really looking forward to them adding more characters, weapons and levels. I would like to see this game do something other Rogue Likes haven't, which is add randomness to the level progress. Always always going from the temple dungeon to the desert to the beach, get's really stale and it wouldn't take much to mix it up. 

Overall I give this game a solid B+ and I really hope it only gets better.",1591979616,1591979616,TRUE,0,1,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,115,63,3229,0,1791,1597906772,,

The developers, despite English not being their first language, are trying hard to communicate to an international audience by using English even in the patch notes and going as far as to thank their community's members for their feedback. 

This is a miracle these days. 

To think that their first ever FPS game is simply insane, the gameplay is actually plenty fun and doesn't feel at all like a first timer project. At the time of me writing this there are 2 classes who play differently and can lead to some insane builds. There are a lot of different guns unlocked by doing achievements ranging from killing X with Y to killing bosses.

73,Gunfire Reborn,70681145,english,"This game is shaping up to be quite amazing! i have 42 hours currently and i've yet to beat the 3rd zone boss! In some rouge-lites you can get a feeling for a ""God run"" but in this game, there seems to be no such Godly runs for the sole fact that anything could still kill you at any point if you are careless, for example; you were too busy fighting a pack of sand wolves and forgot about the sniper who just blew your head clean off. (No gore! haha) but this game doesnt hand hold, its brutally hard in his paces but it trains you to be aware of your surroundings and not just mindlessly shoot at enemies filing up to attack you.  

My one gripe is i think you get the ""2nd"" character far too late into your gameplay, i thought he was gonna be level 15 or maybe 20, but now that ive invested so much time learning how cat boy works with his skills, i kinda dont wanna learn the other, since i got used to how smoke bombs work and doggos are on impact bombs (which, don't help against shield golems.) 

But other than that, this game is really fun! there are so many ways you can take your builds every run, you can focus making Enegry bolts crazy power or maybe do more things with your smoke bombs, can make em a defensive zone, a debuff zone, extra damage zone, carry double/triple/quad amounts of nades. The customization plays wonderfully per character and with the gun choices (and many more to be unlocked) you'll find your favorite for your playstyle soon enough but swapping around and testing other weapons is welcome! 

That cheap needle gun does CRAZY damage if you have the right perks and skills. Without spoiling too much, i had a scroll that places bullets into the chamber on miss, well, if you hold right click with that gun, it spits ammo at the ground like a madman! 

Just an example of silly meme builds also being possible and the amount of replay-ability, add buddies into the mix and it makes things a bit harder, even more adding more friends. (up to 3 friends)

Pros:
Good challenge
Fun guns
Interesting playable characters
Good soundtrack
Good visual design
Interesting use of Borderlands Elements
Can achieve Binding of Isaac levels of OP gear combinations
Big numbers on the screen when you build correctly

Cons:
Rather bland and repetitive level design (until you reach level 3)
Invisible walls result in a one way street straight to the boss
Little to no room for exploration
Can get very unbalanced very quickly for both players and enemies
Lots of typos and grammatical errors
Only 3 bosses that all have rather limited and predictable move sets
Lack of diverse Vault room layouts
Lackluster Occult Scrolls that clutter up an otherwise really good line up
Healing Buns are extremely rare and make getting damaged more punishing than you would think it ought to be
Peer to Peer Multiplayer service results in 999 ping in most players aside from the Host

Overall it will need some more time to cook in the oven but for what you get for 12 bucks, its very much worthwhile to give it a shot.

35,Gunfire Reborn,70655277,english,"Two hours in, I'd call this a good time, and a solid Early Access title that has a ways to go before being complete.

In a nutshell: It has the same strengths and weaknesses you find in any roguelite, a cute aesthetic, and pretty decent gunplay. Little bit light on content in its current state, but it's also inexpensive. Recommended.

*A side note before I review the game. When I purchased it, it filed itself in to a Souls-like dynamic collection, which I would not call at all accurate. If you're here because Steam has told you this is a Souls-like, it is not. It has none of the features of a game that fall in to that category, I think the system just conflated Roguelite and Souls-like for some reason.

Roguelite: It suffers from the same problems you find in any of these games. Its a repetitive grind with difficulty spikes designed to force you to replay it. Variation is low at this point, but I'm hoping that's a symptom of being Early Access. Difficulty is wildly inconsistent, depending on which weapons/power-ups/etc. you have collected, and the types of challenges the game decides to generate on your run.

Gunplay: It's pretty good. A few of the weapons don't feel particularly good, but most do. With only two slots and a dice-roll on what you get it can occasionally feel like you've got a very bad hand for what the game has decided to throw at you, but hey, that's a roguelite for ya. 

Aesthetic: It's cute. Presumably you've already seen the dog and cat. At the time of this writing those are the only characters, and it seems like it's going to take a good many playthroughs with the cat to unlock the dog. I enjoy the cat's powers though, so I'm not going to call that a total loss. I would have liked a pair of options to start with though, with more to unlock later, more akin to Risk of Rain's catalogue of characters. Perhaps more will come in an update.

Content: A little sparse, at the moment. I am once again hoping that is a symptom of the game being Early Access. It's certainly cheap at the moment, so I can't say it's an unfair dollars:content ratio.",1591927037,1591927037,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,1284,56,1379,0,118,1598569556,,

45,Gunfire Reborn,70651892,english,"TL/DR: I felt it became a tedious and frustrating grind rather quickly. 

Thought I would be recommending based on first hour or two playing, started off fun, looks cool and has some interesting weapons, but after under 7 hours I have had enough of it, so I cannot recommend. 

If, like me apparently, you are not so good a FPS gamer as to plough through the early zones getting far into the later zones, it quickly gets boring, as you will be replaying the tedious temple zones over and over and over.... I understand it is a Rogue-like, so starting over is the nature of it, but playing through the same temple zones again and again just to get a tiny bit further before having to do the damn boring temple again gets old. It is apparently randomly generated each time, but this is barely noticeable between runs. Yes after a run you get points to boost your character for the next attempt, but the changes are slight and it just gives the game a real sense of being a grind. Despite the positive aspects I have stopped playing as cannot stand the idea of looking at that temple zone one more time just to get to a insanely difficult boss that would take numerous attempts for me to beat (meaning numerous replays of the zones I am already sick to death of). 

Since they went for a ""adventure level-based game,"" they could have been a bit looser on the 'Rouge' aspect of the gameplay, at least in single player. An option to have check points or to use points for saves, or let you skip zones already done and play different zones in some kind of 'arcade mode'... anything just to make the game actually fun to keep playing and to reduce the repetitive tediousness.",1591919553,1591919553,FALSE,1,1,0.458333343,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,247,8,409,0,409,1591376038,1591930332,"We are sorry for your bad experience.

Hope you can have a try again. BTW, you can revive each other if you play with your friends, so you have higher chance to succeed in challenge."

-Clunky movement
-Sometimes movement isn't responsive (input doesn't register)

cuz , 

I might not be the most mechanically gifted person but me and my friend have done co-op on a lot of hack and slash and shoot'em up  and various games over the years , we have beat tastefully designed difficulty mode games like dark souls series .
We both spent 5 hours  and atleast 14 tries to  ""try"" beat the first boss , and failed everytime ......
could we have pulled it off? , OFCOURSE ....if we tried maybe super hard to do so ......
But i do not think thats how this game was meant to be played.

So, what is the problem?
The boss is scaled bad .....really bad ....how much HP  , the mechanics as well , the 4th floor again is scaled riddiculously ,  there is no room for ""tactical"" play .....yet there is no mechanics to get to mob's face to kill them , without getting slaughtered  ....specially when you need to preserve all your chances to do the boss .

I think the game needs a  lot of balancing  and re-think some core ""sustain"" mechanics.

Hope you can have a try again. BTW, you can revive each other if you play with your friends, so you have higher chance to succeed in challenge."

got it for 10eu. solid game for that money. good shooting good movement, weapons skills etc 

Combos are nice and you have to look out what you pick up since you can F yourself up but advanced depot + any weapon with 0,2 projectile on kill resets after reload is busted when you dont have to reload - pliz dont fix

Add more stuff in the future - even enemies are ok but floor plans are always the same as are enemies spawn points and types. its always the same doods in the same spots. 

more bosses more scrolls more everything 

As is the game is very fun and you will get your moneys worth for that 10 EU. again for the future - add more stuff and this will be a classic. right now its a 40 min run and done - you have to try very hard to even die on elite on first two stages but then again you can get one shot very easely on satge 3 

2 problems with the game - FPS drops with friends but to be fair we did have a rocket launcher that we stacked up to fire like 10+ projectiles at a time with advanced depot / perks and weapon stats. And for some reason when i open the game it moves whatever i have on my second monitor so i have to Tab move it go back to the game and its ok. it happens only when you launch the game. 1st world problems

This game is a massive clumsy mess.

Bought this because my friends were playing it and thought they were in for a good time past some rocky early-access shenanigans, but we were all wrong. Ultra-spongy enemies as early as mid first stage and the entirety of stage 2, the worst platforming and most limp and useless dash skill imaginable. This is just the glaring issues right off the bat too. I can only imagine it gets more sloppy and grindy as time goes on. Maybe the damage isnt so horribly tuned for solo, I have no idea.

All in all this game feels like a chinese mobile game for current-gen phones, just with the out-the-nose microtransactions not yet implemented. Ugly, stolen-assets, clumsy, bullet-spongy. If you want a really really cheap, sloppy fps rogue-lite, go play Tower of guns, Heavy Bullets, Paranautical activity, Ziggurat or Immortal redneck.

46,Gunfire Reborn,70604790,english,"Few thoughts from my first 14 hours.

Simple enough that you can just jump in and play for short periods.. Challenging enough that you can play for hours and feel entertained.

It's not going to impress the hardcore fps players, hitboxes can be a little bit vague sometimes, but for someone like me who isnt super into the genre, this is fun and the 'idea' of headshots for crits is there.. i just feel like some shots that should miss still hit.

This game is WAY more fun with other people.. be that pot luck in the matchmaking system (I've had decent luck there so far), or with friends. 

Gun varieties seem good, and the perks system while a little confusing at the start soon makes sense and is decently varied. 

Graphics aren't going to blow you away, but they're still decent.. sound is there.. never been much of an audiophile :D

Overall, if you're looking for a fun game to take time out with friends, this is a decent buy for an early access title and i'm very much looking forward to seeing where it goes.

51,Gunfire Reborn,70595314,english,"As i would love to give it a positive review , I had always certain  problems with rogue-lites like these.

1. The fact that you always spawn from the same chapter , making it quite a repetetive run everytime you start a new run . rogue-lites like  these will eventually add more chapters that some people will never reach in the same boring order. Making it feel like a waste off extra content , Randomizing the starting chapter would make it less off a chore and improve on the current  rogue-lite formula , so everyone can enjoy a genre like this! 

2. The need to be grinding to a certain level to have a chance to beat a boss or any levels/chapters available in the current game , it's something that was adopted like a MMO , i never liked the fact that i needed to be a certain level to proceed on a certain terrain. In my opinion a rogue-lite should be completely based on your skill level and not on how much hours you spend on it , not to sound a bit racist. But japanese/chinese games are just known for these ridiculous grinds and honestly most people don't like it. We all want the same chances , it makes it fun and fair for everyone to play.

3. Co-op should be unlocked from the start , people who buy a co-op roguelite expect to play with other friends the moment they buy it the fact that i needed to grind to level 10 to play with my friends or randoms , just made me already question why i would want to continue playing?

4. Respawns on co-op should be always right before a boss battle , not after ""does not make any sense""?

5. Difficulty spikes between chapter 1 and chapter 2 are ridiculous and should be balanced out. The fact that i need to spray 30K damage hits killing monkey king in a matter off 25 seconds with a sniper rifle and Pure luck orb scrolls and skills and still not killing the NPC's on chapter 2 in one hit is beyond me , just not enough gold to sustain the ridiculous tanky NPC's with underpowered guns that are apparently as tanky as the chapter 1 boss monkey king?

32,Gunfire Reborn,70570681,english,"*REVIEW OF VER. 6.9 (Nice)*

Gunfire Reborn is a Roguelite FPS that takes inspiration of Chinese culture. The gameplay feels like Borderlands-esque Gun looting and shooting while also giving us buff mechanics like Dead Cells or Risk of Rain.

Whilst the core gameplay relies on delving into the dungeons to reach the end and fight through hordes of enemies with your skills and guns, there's also attempting to find good loot in the meantime, bettering your character with certain scrolls that will aid your runs or sync with your guns to provide extra firepower. GR also has a leveling system for your character so that in your future runs, you will become stronger and more versatile either to clear waves of enemies or to assist your team in progressing forward. As with the guns, there are many to choose from that interact in different ways i.e. a Lightning glove that can damage enemies close to your target or a... Lizard that can fire remote bombs ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Pros:
Its Fun to play! Solo or Multiplayer, you'll be having fun in different runs with different builds
The guns are neat! Some of them are really nice to use and the mechanics of the damage system somewhat make it satisfying
The Aesthetic is nice! Something about games that take from Asian culture end up being real nice to play in

Cons:
Early Access; The game is still well within development which means that yes, there are going to be bugs and underdeveloped features of the game. A lot of the games only cons is solely on the reasoning above.

Okay, time for the longer section, pros, cons, what they are doing right, and what they could improve on:

Pros:
- Simplicity of the art style: Cartoony but in a fun and enjoyable way, making it easy on a computer system too
- A lot of varied weapons before adding in the inscriptions which are randomized when the weapon drops
- Replayability: You rarely get the same items and scrolls in the same runs, making each run different
- Variety of enemies unique to each map
- Early on you'll feel punished for not spending all of your points on talents, wasting small amounts here and there, but as you upgrade you'll be able to start storing them. This helps a LOT with replayability, as you can always progress towards something, even with a bad run.
- Scrolls, there are a lot of them and they can alter your play style or they can just augment it. The best part is, if you get one that doesn't interact well with another, you can drop one on the ground. Only certain ones (mostly cursed) are permanent for a run
- Gemini Inscriptions - These are mostly a late run inscription that can add a little more flavor to your run, but are by no means a requirement to beat a boss, more so because you need both weapons to have the same Gemini
- Character upgrades: This almost made the cons list, due to the fact you'll very rarely get a skill you want, maxed out. I put it in the pros though, because they are another layer of difference for each run

Cons:
- Inscriptions - There are a large variety of inscriptions, which is very nice to spice up the weapons. I'm putting this under cons though, due to the fact you can get negative synergies in inscriptions. Example: Exclusive Inscription that limits the weapon to two rounds in the mag. Second inscription boosts magazine size by 60% (has no effect)
- Weapon upgrades from craftsman - This one is due to the issue of the craftsman ONLY being able to upgrade the damage and re-roll the Gemini inscription. Early weapons will only have a few inscriptions, and it seriously hampers you to keep weapons with little to no inscriptions on them, even if they are your favorite. - Don't upgrade weapons that only have one or two green effects
- Parkour: Ugh... it is nice when it is well done, but the Fjord one is a little too punishing, the non-challenge chest is harder to get then the challenge one. Granted, this is completely ruled out IF you have good speed upgrades.
- As much as the variety of enemies was nice, the con part of it, is the weak spots being the head as the vast majority of enemies are humanoid or beast. Other then bosses, only one enemy has a different weak point.
- Copper is a currency gained to buy items and upgrades inside each run, I'm listing this as a con, primarily because there are talents slots wasted on this, and it is only used as a gating mechanism to prevent players from upgrading weapons too much.
- Weak traps: Traps in runs are more an annoyance then anything dangerous, flame jets take several seconds to kill. Boulders are only a real threat if you are careless and you get bounced into others inside a trap vault.
- Only two difficulty modes as of this post: Normal and Elite
- Gated second character behind level of talents - If it was an early unlock, it wouldn't be so bad, but the second character can take awhile to unlock if you have bad runs.

With all that out of the way, moving on to what they are doing right. Honestly this game is off to a brilliant start, and the list above basically addresses everything I could go into detail about in a long winded post. Being Early Access, I just hope the devs take a look at feedback and maybe adjust some things.

What they could do better? More characters to choose from, and maybe add some skins so running in groups, people don't all look EXACTLY the same. Requirements for unlock certain weapons and scrolls, some of them are a bit insane, requiring 100 fire kills on an enemy that only shows up in the last few stages and you usually only see eight at most on elite difficulty?


So overall, I do recommend this game for anyone that enjoys a first person shooter that each run is different on. I know some people are saying it is a mix of Borderlands and Risk of Rain, but the similarity to Borderlands is only in the RNG of the weapon rolls. This is very much a roguelite game: Run in shooting, get new weapons, unlock in-run upgrades for your character, obtain scrolls, and progress until you drop; then? You spend points on talents to permanently improve yourself going forward, making each run a little stronger.",1591742618,1591742618,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,162,2,5070,0,2211,1598313355,,

You play as one of two characters, and each time you play, you start at the beginning. Throughout the game you find scrolls that buff your skills, and chests that allow you to select randomly determined, and character specific, buffs. You will also find weapons with increasingly higher statistics throughout the run. When you die, your progress is reset. However, unlike other rogue-likes, there is an element of progression through a skill tree that persists between runs.

94,Gunfire Reborn,70549867,english,"This game is extremely fun. Most rogue-lites are very hit or miss with the actual rogue-lite mechanics in my opinion. I feel like this game has nailed it. Progression never feels stale or stagnant. The talents that you can upgrade in between runs all feel needed, leading to the ""just one more run"" mentality just so I can get an extra 5% copper my next time through. Some of the talents undoubtedly feel better than others, but they all feel useful. The gun play in this game is phenomenal. All of the guns are a joy to use. Some definitely take more getting used to than others, but once you learn on a particular gun works, it is nothing but satisfying to use. Almost all of the guns feel useful too. Multiple times I unlocked a gun thinking it was garbage, only to realize I underestimated it, or some particular roles made it extremely powerful. This game is especially fun with friends, though the game does seem significantly more difficult in multiplayer. This is not an issue though, as long as the people you're playing with have a brain. The only things I would say are lacking in this game are the multiplayer and movement. There are some REALLY bad issues in the multiplayer that can lead from slight lag, to everyone in the game freezing, then resuming completely dead. While the issues don't happen too too often, they are very frequent and often ruin runs. The movement also seems a bit buggy. You will often get stuck on things you never noticed because of odd hit boxes. In some of the parkour vaults, certain platforms have arrows sticking out of them, that while seemingly insignificant, have a small hit box. These unknown small hit boxes often lead to feet clipping and failed jumps, something that can become very, very annoying, especially when the parkour vaults are timed. The platforming is even worse in multiplayer, where tiny, normally inconsequential, amounts of rubberbanding is VERY frequent. This is normally not an issue, but can sometimes make some of the jumps feel impossible. Both of these downsides are not really that bad in the long run, and a fix more multiplayer has already been said to be on the way. This game is infectiously enjoyable and nothing but a blast to play. As such a smash hit, less than a week after release in my opinion, I cannot wait to see where this game goes.

[h1]What I liked:[/h1]
The gunplay feels pretty good, each gun feels distinct and there is already a large variety of weapons to use. You have your standard weapons like your assault rifle, your SMG, your pistol, etc, but there are also pretty novel weapons as well such as the Thunderglove (a glove you wear that shoots a beam that hits all nearby enemies) and the Bone Cannon (basically Zarya's cannon from Overwatch, it sucks in all nearby enemies and detonates after a few seconds). Each weapon is well animated and they're all worth using, even the starting pistol which actually scales with your other weapons so that it's still relevant throughout a run.

Next, I really think that the progression of the game is pretty well done. You have both run-related progression (such as weapon damage, scrolls which give unique modifiers to the player, etc) as well as permanent progression (such as increased health, ammo capacity, etc), and you always feel like there's something to strive towards as a result. Some of the aforementioned scrolls can really change the way you play, such as one that gives you two additional dash charges or one where headshots do 4x damage but at the cost of lower non-headshot damage, and it's fun to see what combination of modifiers you can get.

The two characters as of writing are quite fun to play as. You start with a hat-donning cat who can throw smoke grenades and has an AoE stun, which makes him pretty strong at dealing element damage and taking out large groups of enemies. Once you hit level 30, you then unlock the second character which is the dog - my personal favourite! He can dual-wield his weapons and can spec into being tanky while doing so, making him pretty solid for melting single targets with his unmatched DPS. There are more characters coming, so I'm hoping they are just as fun to play as the existing ones.

Finally, the aesthetic of the game is decently charming in my opinion. Yes, the graphics are pretty simple and the characters are a bit generic, but I do like the colourful environments and enemy design. But I think most importantly the game runs really well due to the lack of graphical fidelity which is always important for shooter games.

[h1]What I was meh about:[/h1]
If you've ever played Borderlands, you'll be aware of the different elements that each weapon can have which give additional damage towards certain types of enemies. This is pretty much the case for this game as well and it works identically: fire is strong against flesh (red health), corrosion works best against armour (yellow health), and shock makes short work of shields (blue health). That being said, I was never really a fan of this type of design to begin with as it means that not having a weapon of the required element just means that you'll take way longer to kill those enemies and you can unfortunately only hold two weapons at a time, so you'll be missing out on at least one element for your guns. This also trivialises weapons with no element as it's just too effective to combo elements due to the bonuses you get from doing so, which is where you can dish out lots of damage.

As for the level design, it's decent enough but it never really shakes things up. You start in the same zone and the level progression is pretty much identical throughout each run. Additionally, some of the portal areas you can access are a bit annoying as there are platforming sections in them that don't feel that great.

[h1]What I disliked:[/h1]
I only have one real aspect that I disliked about the game, but unfortunately it's probably the biggest drawback for me which is the online co-op. I feel that this game would be even more fun with friends or even just randoms as there is matchmaking, but in its current state it's simply too laggy and seemingly has client-side lag that occurs whenever enemies spawn, which has lead to a lot of cheap deaths as I wait several seconds for the game to update. Definitely the biggest area for improvement, but it's understandable given that this isn't a high-budget title.

[h1]Overall...[/h1]
For an early access title, this is already worth the price of admission and I've had quite a bit of fun with it. I definitely recommend giving it a go if you're looking for a new shooter to play or at least keeping an eye on it as it receives updates.

[b]Edit:[/b] OK, the devs have responded to this review and I think I should offer some more clarity regarding the online co-op of the game. As I was going off of matchmade games, the lag issues may just be on my end as I have yet to verify if they're because I am connecting to far-away hosts or just hosts with poor Internet. The game seems to use peer-to-peer networking so it could purely be a host issue and not an issue with the game itself.",1591667742,1591710033,TRUE,1,0,0.523809552,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,213,21,692,0,555,1597944585,1591683274,"We are aware of this issue and continue to optimize it, please give us more time.

I seriously mean the spoiler warning is a spoiler.

Multiplayer for whatever reason works as intended with some of your nearby friends... but for the other friends that are just as close to you geographically it doesn't work, when the host starts shooting you start lagging no matter who's hosting the other players suffer. [i](friend and I are in the same state, at most 5 hours drive away and we can't play together, its unplayable. while I can play with my other friends perfectly fine who are even further away and he has experienced the same issue with his friends.)[/i]

The game play loop is linear but still very bare bones, [spoiler]having only 3 unique stages and 3 unique bosses is fine. but I really hope more get added or we get to see a looping system similar to risk of rain/risk of rian 2.[/spoiler]

The gun play is fun, except for the times you don't get the ""good"" guns. Some guns are seriously underpowered and there for overlooked. After getting the hang of the game I've started just mentally blocking guns I've thought to be trash. Balancing is definitely needed, not just buffing weapons but also nerfing weapons.

The game is good, its not quiet there yet though. If you want a fun single player game that you can quickly bang out in like 20 hours this game is great, but I don't feel its met its standard of ""multiplayer"" or ""co-op""",1591353142,1591702441,FALSE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,86,11,1883,0,1284,1599014494,1591419740,"Hi, we are working on this issue.

The enemies are pretty difficult but not in an overpowered way, but more in a mechanic based way which encourages you to dodge and learn their attacks to survive. The bosses are pretty difficult in the fact that if you don't have good weapons or scrolls, then you will be in for the longest dodge battle ever. The 2 playable characters are really interesting. I have not gotten to level 30 so I cant use the dog, however you start out with the cat. I thought that the cat was pretty cool so I decided to buy a purple glass tesla ball and a pistol. I soaked the pistol in gasoline and lit it on fire to make it look like scorching rounds. I gave these items to my cat (I don't have a dog) and was hoping to see Freddy Meowcury shoot the pistol and throw the ball like he does in the game. Instead what heppened was the gun discharged a bullet (probably from being too hot but thats just my guess) and ended up ricocheting off the cement floor of my house and hitting a bystander outside my window. I grabbed the gun away from Freddy and ran outside to help the poor girl who was shot and she was out cold. I grabbed and put her in my van to take her to the hospital. As she bled out in the back of my van, I rushed down the highway to get some help. I live pretty far away from an ER so I was doing about 116 MPH down the road. Suddenly there were flashing red and blue lights behind me telling me to pull over. I couldn't risk any more time so I stuck my hand out the window to try and let them know that something was wrong. A bullet flew through the back window of my van and struck the radio. I forgot that I still had the gun in my left hand so I dropped it and tried to fix the radio, but to no avail. After only a few minutes there were at least a dozen cop cars and two choppers flying overhead with their lights flashing down on me. right as I got to the hospital, a cop pit-maneuvered me and I did at least 6 full barrel rolls into a ditch. The girl flew forward and cut her throat on a piece of glass, which sucks, but I decided to not worry about it and let the officers take care of it. I got out my trusty bowieknife and cut my seat belt away. A cop yelled to me ""DON'T MOVE!"" and tased me. The next week I was in court and was charged with kidnapping, first degree murder, sexual assault, speeding, reckless driving, and resisting arrest. Apparently an old man called the cops and told them that I shot and kidnapped some girl on the streets. I'm not too sure when that was, but it sucks I wasn't able to save that girl.

64,Gunfire Reborn,70521478,english,"A charming and addictive, if a bit unpolished, roguelite FPS. Pretty standard roguelite core gameplay loop - each zone has a few floors full of regular enemies and a boss, you keep going till you die and earn points to unlock persistent upgrades based on how far you make it. You'll unlock various buffs as you go, and guns can have a wide range of effects, so each run you'll wind up with a different 'build' as you try to stack synergistic buffs and weapon mods. 

Some areas of the game are a bit rough around the edges. The second class with its dual wielding ability is a cool idea, but it feels kinda awkward to play. Some enemies telegraph better than others, and the numeric balance feels off in places. The peer-to-peer multiplayer has pretty severe lag/desync issues at the moment, which is rather unfortunate as co-op is a blast when it works. Hopefully some of these issues get ironed out as the game gets further along in early access. 

At $12 I think it's an easy recommendation. In its current state you can easily get your money's worth just playing solo, and if you're patient there's a lot of fun to be had with co-op when it actually works.

One thing to note: you can play with friends right away, but to play with randoms you have to reach level 10 (which will take a couple hours or so).

0,Gunfire Reborn,70510922,english,"Well worth the price tag, plenty of fun.

Like everyone says it's kind of a mix of Risk of Rain and Borderlands but I don't think people put enough of a point on how good the abilities are. Both characters have three different types of builds, 6 builds total, and these builds have sub builds. For the first character you can either use your ability to freeze large mobs of enemies for a good chunk of time while you land some free critical shots or you can lose the freeze ability and start making it do even more damage. If you're playing with friends you can even turn your grenades into the perfect support action by making enemies take more damage and deal less on top of doing good DoT damage if you take elemental scrolls. That's three full fun builds that can easily last you until the second character, or if you prefer the first one for the rest of the game. The second character is my personal favorite and you can either go full gunzerker, explosives, or crit build. While *technically* you could go full crit with the mage I personally feel the gunfighter does it better because of his perks like Substained Fire and a few more.

TL:DR - With a minimum of 6 pure builds and 12 sub builds, 34 guns, 104 scrolls, and the class abilities it's really just up to you how long you want to play this game but it is EASILY worth the price tag and will provide you with hours and hours of fun with either singleplayer or with friends.

Disclaimer: Yes it's EARLY ACCESS people so things are not going to be perfect.

-
This does not feel like a game thats just come into early access at all. even with the only 3 levels, its still so fleshed out and polished that you could be mistaken for a released game. Running through the 3 5-stage levels also feels like an appropriate length for a roguelite. we'll just needs some more for variation.

this is basically deadcells progression with immortal redneck gameplay, and theres so many cool items that every run has something and when you get your favorite guns perks and skills and get some ""shops"" that let you upgrade some modifiers on your guns to your liking, man you feel like a god.

the gameplay is absolutely fantastic, really hits the nail on its head, gunplay feels fast and solid, and you really feel the gun upgrades and perks work when you get them. 

the graphics are low poly style, and it works well and the guns look and feel great and wildly varied in design and purpose.

combine that with plenty of permanent character upgrades and new weapons to unlock, and 4 player coop, and an elite difficulty that you get after completion, which adds traps and harder enemies throughout the game, and its early access and already this polished and full of content, this is going to be a great game once it sees its full release.

39,Gunfire Reborn,70177427,english,"I want to clear a few things up for people who are interested in buying this. Many reviews are comparing this to Borderlands and Risk of Rain. First off this is nothing like Borderlands at all. Borderlands is a loot-shooter with RPG elements and this game is a rogue-like FPS where death means it's back to main screen. It's more like Risk of Rain but it also isn't.

Gunfire Reborn is an obvious work in progress, it looks nice, it runs smoothly, has a lot of variety of weapons and upgrades to use throughout your runs, a talent tree to upgrade base stats and passive perks but the balance is what stands out most. You have to beat stages to reach the boss room and these stages are fairly easy which gives you a false sense of confidence about facing the boss because he can 1 or 2 shot you to death because he moves so quickly and strings combos to punish you while self-destructing mobs run all over the place during each phase. I attempted to beat the boss at least 8 times between levels 1-15 and I just couldn't get a perfect combination of weapons/passives in the dungeon that would increase my run speed and dashing ability. It was only when I partied with a group (4 including myself) of level 15-20's and we were still getting 1-2 hit by the boss constantly throughout the battle. Finally we beat the boss and move on to the beginning of the Desert zone only for the 4 of us to get completely wrecked in 30 seconds by a group of 10 or so enemies in the first area of the first stage. I enjoy a challenge and I generally enjoy grinding but the balance doesn't feel quite right, it's blatantly obvious it is the biggest problem with this game and I hope they  intent on working on it some more. All of this was done on ""Normal"" mode, I can't even imagine how hard it's going to be when I eventually unlock the next difficulty.

Edit: So I finally played a second time. This time I played for 5 straight hours and made a new friend and we did quite well. We were both level 20ish when we started and finished around 36 or so. We can consistently destroy the entire first zone and boss easily now with the exception of a couple of horrible runs where none of our preferred weapons are dropping and the scrolls are utter trash, but we can't beat Stage 3 of the Desert which is right before the boss. The game is still punishing us with maximum upgraded weapons, great scrolls and good teamwork. All 4 of us were communicating and sharing weapons, specialising in different elements and it just punishes us over and over and over. Yep..

TL;DR, 
+looks nice
+runs smoothly
+good variety of weapons/upgrades 
+talent tree that can be upgraded (passive bonuses to Heros and weapons)

46,Gunfire Reborn,70496471,english,"Pros:
- permanent progression
- satisfying gunplay
- no consumables (most roguelikes have them and it always annoys me)
- quick rounds that don't require mental preparation before jumping in
- modifiers from pickups and weapon inscriptions that significantly change gameplay
- mechanical increase of difficulty instead of just inflationary enemy stats (both shouldn't be taken to extremes)

Cons:
- While enemies and loot are randomized, the rooms are only random in the sense that you don't know which one you will spawn into. The layout doesn't change and each biome has give or take 4 different rooms layouts. I would expect randomization of the layout as well, especially given how tiny the rooms are.
- There are some really cool weapons, but also a lot of boring ones that are weak at the same time which I feel could just be left out the game entirely. Looking at you, SMGs, autorifles and a sniper that deals less damage per shot than my starter gun, at 3x lower fire rate and an aiming wiggle no other weapon has.
- After each death you have to spend all the essences you collected immediately, but the cost of upgrades rises quickly. That means you'll often have a surplus of essences that you can't spend on anything, and that just always feels like you wasted a little bit of your time

Suggestions (on top of everything mentioned in Cons):
- Let us choose from 2-3 primary and secondary skills at the start. Of course this would mean additional work on many new pickup effects, but it would help a lot with mixing things up beyond of what's currently possible, in such a replay based game.
- Some scrolls give high rewards for high risk/penalty. Before picking up such a scroll, there should be a warning, like a very obvious red glow around the scroll. As even after a few hours you'll have picked up hundreds of scrolls and it becomes somewhat of an autopilot to press F. Nothing sucks more than going for a crit build and then accidentaly pick up a scroll that removes all crit multiplier.

I enjoy the game and for 10 bucks is totally fine. I imagine multiplayer being a ton of fun too. It's like a fast-paced version of Borderlands in small randomized areas with fast progression and no story or quests to distract you from gameplay.

Follow me on twitch - Twitch.tv/XtremeNugget

Original : It's okay but lacking content. also wish the levels were RNG


Edit : This review is in the first week of release into ""EARLY ACCESS""

While the game is still in so early development it has a lot of potential to become a top game in the rouge-like section.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Graphics:

The art style of the game reminds me a lot of risk of rain 2 and in a good way, while it's in first person and the combat is a lot faster it fits well into the atmosphere of the world the game is building. Graphics 8.5/10
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Gameplay:

The gameplay while it is like any other rogue-lite/like games has it's unique style of delivering a system of RPG-lite with character skill building and personalizing a style of your own. 
While so early in the release the game doesn't have that much variety in guns from the start and you are quick to recognize what guns are the best for what enemy and you stick to it.

Start level/boss fights are in the same rhythm. It's always the same boss, always with the same moves and always in the same order.

I do wish more guns would be added and more RNG to the enemies/levels with a lot more variety of moves in the box. Gameplay 7/10

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Multiplayer/Co-op:

While multiplayer has it's golden moments of playing either with friends or random people in the matchmaking system the system itself has some major unplayable flaws in it.

Loot is personal while can be shared after you drop it, the same goes for money and rewards. 

The game has a lot of connection problems and lags while only in specific rooms (that i've noticed) and it spikes up at random but I am not sure what may cause this issue in the long run. Multiplayer/Co-op 8/10

Decent weapon variety improved by a massive amount of available inscriptions (additional effects applied to guns like conditional rate of fire bonuses, crit bonuses, big boosts that come with drawbacks etc.). Satisfying - for the time being - number of passive items a.k.a. occult scrolls.

As of right now GR seems to have a problem with the existence of some very powerful synergies between gun inscriptions and occult scrolls (like stacking luck or additional projectiles until cap because you never reload), as well as a few character skills and ascensions (most notably dog's invincibility on taking 25% hp of damage), which means that it is quite simple and consistent to become busted by the time you get to the final stages of the game. Admittedly that does not mean you cannot die - like in Isaac or Gungeon -, because here you usually are a glass cannon. These interactions IMO should still be inspected by the devs, with a couple getting the nerfhammer preferably.

79,Gunfire Reborn,70481846,english,"7/10 pretty fun fps roguelite for solo.

The game is pretty fun and challenging solo for the most part. I still have some issues with it but if you're only getting it for solo it's decent. If you are getting it for multiplayer I'd recommend getting something else. As of right now there isn't any kind of communication in multiplayer text, voice, or pings. If you plan on playing co-op with friends then this isn't an issue but there are still some issues.

In solo it has different problems. The first handful of attempts will likely be short because of the initial difficulty. As you earn more souls to upgrade your stats you'll get farther and farther. The optional side areas (vaults) are not so optional as you'll want every possible opportunity to get scrolls/weapons/ascensions to give yourself a better chance. Some of the vaults are timed puzzle platforming sections. These are mostly fine in single player but the geometry on some of them is pretty janky and needs some tweaking. The movement also isn't the most precise for these either.

In multiplayer the issues with this are just made worse. Now you may have lag and/or rubberbanding in these and they can become nearly impossible to complete within the time limit. The number of enemies increases as well as their health and damage. Which would be fine except many of the areas are hallways and with four people and the increased number of enemies it may be hard to see what you're shooting at or what's shooting at you. There will be times in which you get seemingly one-shot by an enemy because you couldn't see the attack, the damage, or anything at all. Thankfully your teammates can revive you but if they don't revive you in time then you're out until they beat the next boss fight assuming they can make it to it and beat it without you. And then you'll be behind in scrolls, souls, gold, and potentially weapons so you're probably not going to be much of a help after that.

There's not very much content in the game as of right now. Two difficulties. A decent chunk of weapons and scrolls but only two characters, three zones and their respective bosses. The occasional optional vault breaks up the gameplay with the platforming sections but that's it. There aren't many events worth noting outside of normal gameplay. Not much in the way of replay value once you beat the game. For the current pricetag of $12 this might be worth it but I don't recommend it for multiplayer, solo maybe, but the small amount of content that you'll be repeating over and over will get stale fairly quick.",1591610601,1591610601,FALSE,1,0,0.477351934,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,635,40,853,0,853,1591608630,1592571579,"Hi, we are trying our best to fix the lag in matching, and you can play with your friends in the same region first.

Oh and variety of weapons and the random builds you can create around them are pretty great too. The two characters (with apparently more to come) are very different compared to each other and each are as effective as the other.

I do find the enemy types a bit samey at times (dude who rapid fires, dude who fires homing shots, dude who carries a shield and what not), except for those that are unique to their own stages but they are generally very unforgiving and fun to fight through anyway so it is not much of an issue.

22,Gunfire Reborn,70468353,english,"It's a fun little game, BUT is incredibly frustrating. 
1.) Weapons are locked behind challenges like Kill 20 of X enemy. Thats fine. But in a fully RNG game sometimes you just won't see a certain enemy type thats locking a really good weapon, like the Prism. The game kept spawning me Lightning Grenadiers instead of Poison Grenadiers.
2.) The starting upgrades like +shields/health are honestly worthless. They are helpful in dealing with enemies early on, but this brings me to my next point
3.) HOMING ATTACK ENEMIES. They literally take out all the fun in the game. You thought the Longbow Archers on stage 1 were bad??? I have every shield/health upgrade. Here comes Stage 2. Straw Hat Snipers. They spawn in like CRAZY, sometimes there are 5 at a time constantly shooting at you. AND THEY FUCKING HURT! Getting hit by 2/3 of these is basically a death sentence. Whenever I see these Snipers spawn in, I immediately run away, get into a spot where I can shoot them but they can't shoot me and kill them. I literally have not made it to the Stage 2 boss because of these fucking Snipers
4.) Dodge is AWFUL. it's a core mechanic of this game, the first boss has huge AOE moves that you HAVE to use the Dodge ability to get out of the way.... but it's on a 3 second cooldown, BARELY FUCKING MOVES YOU, and it feels like they slowed your character by 50% to make dodging necessary....but it just feels slow as shit moving between rooms because your character moves like he has a broken leg

Cons: [list] 
[*]The translation from Chinese to English is incredibly rough sometimes
[*]Co-op has some occasional crazy lag spikes that can make you freeze in place for 30+ seconds just to find out you died

Pros: [list] 
[*]Overall pretty fun gameplay
[*]Pretty well polished for a game this early in development
[*]Plenty of variety in which we can only hope for more in future updates (Only 2 heroes so far etc.)
[*]Huge replayability, which is the most important part of a roguelike, similar to Risk Of Rain, has all sorts of modifiers and gun build possibilities to get you working for that ""God Build/God Run""
[*]Graphics are pretty simple yet appealing, I find them similar to Deep Rock Galactic, and the game is only 1.8GB because of this!

46,Gunfire Reborn,70463102,english,"This game is a gem! One of the best values one Steam for under $20!

It's an FPS rogue-lite (it has run to run progression systems, but you still start over on death). It takes clear inspirations from games like Borderlands, and other games in the rogue genre such as Enter the Gungeon, Slay the Spire, or Risk of Rain. It has surprisingly really solid shooting mechanics. It has fantastic RPG-like elements that starts with a really satisfying character progression tree. Run after run, I keep coming back to get those extra stats. Those elements extend to builds within runs as well, as gun stats have dynamic modifiers that could turn a gun you aren't typically a fan of into a powerhouse with the right synergies.

The game has satisfying moment to moment gameplay, with good enemy diversity and level design. The weapon design is very interesting as well, with options ranging from a ninja kunai, hand-held dragon, or a laser glove. It even asks interesting choices of the player such as whether or not it's worth continuing a run you are crushing at the cost of long term gains in the progression tree.

It's few downfalls are that the beginnings of runs can get stale and repetitive if you don't get long runs often because there are only three stages and they don't change in order. It is always the same stage and enemies in the beginning. Changing which level comes first and adding 2 more that could get cycled in randomly on any given run for the sake of variety would go a long way. There are two different playable characters that successfully differentiate themselves, but there are only two for now. 

As the game adds more characters, bosses, and perhaps something to play for beyond the initial three levels, like some sort of looping mechanic, it will become increasingly rewarding and addictive. As it stands now, it's initial offerings are very polished and satisfying. Totally fun, especially with friends, and more than worth the price.",1591569999,1591569999,TRUE,1,0,0.478243798,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,135,4,3616,58,1511,1601960969,,

Borderland inspirations come in the form of elemental damage match ups. However, unlike the borderlands series, the shooting in this game is amazing. Every weapon has a particular weight and feel to it. Headshots grant instant gratification. Recoil has a perfect balance between being there and being annoying. Heavier weapons actually feel heavier and have pros and cons. There are no guns that feel bad to shoot. As for the risk of rain 2 comparison, I think it's because that's the only popular Rouge like that people have played cause it has very few similarities. I'd more compare it to Dead cells as weapons and upgrades are unlocked in a similar manner requiring you to kill a certain type of enemy a certain number of times. Also similar, there is a currency that you get at the end of a run that can be used to unlock minor upgrades. This is also similar to how gold persisted after a run for upgrades in rouge legacy.

Controls and shooting are super tight and all of the weapons feel fantastic to use. Abilities and scrolls can make for some crazy combinations, especially the further you progress. Never ending mags, setting enemies on fire heals you, etc. Its an absolute blast, especially because you can make scroll builds that synergize with others in your group.

Could use some better translations and maybe letting players respawn at the end of each stage rather than after a boss. The game is incredibly difficult and enemy health (including bosses) scales based on how many players you have. But if someone leaves or dies, it doesn't scale back down so it can end a run very quick, especially right before a boss stage. Going in to a boss room with 1 or 2 people when its scaled for 4 can be a nightmare. Plus its no fun to die early in a level set and then be stuck watching everyone else.

I would recommend this to everyone. For $12, this is a steal and will keep you entertained for hours and hours, even more if you get a group of buddies to go in with, but its still plenty fun on a solo run.

The game is ok, 9 euros ok, you're not getting any more value than that out of it right now, in fact it's probably not even worth that much. 

The shooting is ok, nothing amazing, nothing atrocious.
The vast majority of weapons is trash so you probably will just end up using the 3-4 everyone uses.
The movement is, again, ok, although jumping and platforming feels awkward and considering that some vaults/rooms require you to do some platforming (which is something NOBODY wants/expects in this type of game and it ends up feeling out of place/breaking the gameplay rythm) makes it an issue. They should remove all the little platforming there is altogether and be done with it.
The levels feel the same and the little randomization they have might as well not be there because it really doesn't matter. Also, some rooms feel too big, others not big enough.
The mechanics to regain health are a bit shit and a lot of stuff is just gonna flat out 1-2 hit you even on normal so there's a lot to be looked at there from the dev side.
The two classes don't really feel distinct enough, it's no ror2 in regards to classes so don't expect that, and if any other they add is gonna follow the same lines they won't be different either.

This game has some potential but a lot needs to be changed/added/fixed. The way it is currently, you'll probably play it 1 to few hours and never touch it again until some patch comes out, or at all.

22,Gunfire Reborn,70403712,english,"Hey!
I really love this game. I'm super exited for updates and showed this game all my friends. I recently found a bug/glitch in the game. I don't know how this happened, but I putted my Computer on save Energy mode (with GunFire Reborn opened) and came back a few hours later. After that, the enemies started spazzing around and teleporting around. The also shot wothout any delay and gone super wild. I hope you fix this.
I also think that the leveling system is not that well made. It would be better that you could save the Soul Essence or only a part of it (like 25% or 50%), because sometimes, you just can't make upgrades. I understand why they did this, so you will lose everything, because the game is very new. But please come up with a better idea.
Now to the game itself:
I like the way it can be played, as a fps that is roguelite. The weapons are mostly balanced, but sometimes they are very bad (eg. the Sniper, it takes much ammo, does literally 0 damage). Maybe the next idea from me is stupid, but what about a mode where you can play against each other, collect loot'n stuff? Sorry for my stupid idea, but this would make the game even better. The idea of battling exists because I like the way how you play this game. Battles with friends are not typical for roguelite games, but hey... Why don't try something new? :D
I hope you work on the game for more updates :D

23,Gunfire Reborn,70429840,english,"Fun game at a great price.  
As you rack up kills on different enemies you automatically unlock new weapons and scrolls/artifacts, ensuring the game stays fresh with variety.  
When you die you can invest in a variety of talents, like more ammo/grenades, free advanced gun when starting, extra health/shield, increase chance of specialized weapon signature, etc.  Making the game quite addictive wanting to keep improving those stats and getting further along in the adventure with more advanced and varied weaponry.
On the downside, where I think the low price offsets any temporary negatives (game is in EA), the shooting doesn't feel as good as many other shooters.  Some of the controls and key mappings seem a bit rough (at least for k/m, I'm not going to play a shooter with a controller) but on the plus side they are remappable which I recommend you consider doing.  Also multiplayer matches, at least late at night, can be difficult to find, especially if impatient.  
I've only played solo so far and don't feel you have to play multiplayer to enjoy the game.

40,Gunfire Reborn,70423333,english,"Gunfire Reborn is a very impressive and addicting Rogue-Like Dungeon Crawler with MAJOR flaws. In no way shape or form is this a bad game. I just can't recommend a game that has this many balancing issues. I understand this is made by a single dev and well, it shows. Reasons why this cannot be recommended:

1. The progression system is a bit ""grindy."" You need to upgrade your damage resistance, health, and shield by doing multiple playthroughs. This wouldn't be a problem but the Stage progression immediately has a huge difficulty spike after stage 1. You'll take crazy amounts of damage and can even get killed in 2-3 shots on Stage 3! Also, the currency you use to upgrade your stats do not carry over and stack with multiple playthroughs. So if you get 30 souls and use 25 and there's nothing for 5 souls, that's it! You just lose them and you end up back with 0 after starting a new run.

2. The weapons feel a bit under-powered. Not saying you should be shredding through enemies with ease but the weapons don't really pack a punch to them. The elemental effects don't really seem to do much except for corrosion.

3. Co-op is pretty much broken in the fact that if someone dies in your party the health of bosses do not go down. Even if they die at the first stage the boss will have stacked health which makes it near impossible to kill within a reasonable amount of time. Partners will not be revived until you beat the boss and move on to the next world which is a questionable choice. Yes, they can revive themselves once (sometimes 3 times with a certain item) and yes, you can revive them but you are given very little time to revive your partner.

4. The first boss is way too powerful. The boss can 2 shot you if you aren't paying attention even for a second. He has way too much health and he will spawn bomberheads that can nearly kill you and slow you to the point where it's just game over. This is a huge spike in difficulty and needs to be a bit easier for a first boss.

5. I know I had mentioned this before but there are certain normal enemies that can easily 2 shot you and that's a bit dumb in my opinion.

I could go on and on about what this game does right but I just feel the flaws need to be brought to light and hopefully worked on.",1591506686,1591506686,FALSE,1,0,0.457429051,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,472,3,1104,0,215,1598141867,1591520777,"Hi,most of issues you point out do exist.We are aware of the difficulty and plan to make some adjustment in our future update.Thanks for playing our game and providing feedback."

67,Gunfire Reborn,70413514,english,"The game is fun and needs some cleaning up to really shine. 
- Friendly collision in Co-Op should simply be removed. No reason for that to exist. 
- Weapon reloading animations need to be either trimmed or changed to match the ACTUAL reload speed. When a weapon looks loaded, sounds loaded, and should be loaded it isn't loaded. Another answer to this would be a small 'Cast Bar' or some radial progression symbol in the crosshairs to show the weapon's reload speed visually. All we have right now is feel and the animations are misleading for some weapons. 
- Along with animations / general clunkyness is weapon swapping. Abilities can be cast quickly and are fun to use but after the ability there is a small window where you cannot swap weapons. Spamming the button just causes problems. 
- Either make the default weapon better or non-existent unless you're out of ammo. Another option is to just have the 'Use Last Weapon' keybind pull out the default weapon instead and remove it from the 'Mousewheel' weapon selection in the controls. No point in having a keybind to use a previous weapon when there are only three slots and one of them is reserved for the crappy starter gun. 
- The Sniper Rifle shots should be hitscan. Feels bad when you can watch the enemy sidestep headshots and flip around. 
- Stop making enemies that can remove themselves from the field of battle i.e. Blinking / Teleport or digging. It isn't too bad YET but the theme seems to be there and please for the love of all that is holy don't make more of those. All they do is waste a player's time, and with how dodge spammy enemies already are with your non-hitscan weapons it's not engaging. Nobody wants to hurry up and wait for an enemy to simply exist.

Gunfire Reborn is an FPS roguelike with immense depth - there's always another challenge to take up, another build to try, and another unlock to push for. The gameplay is fun on its own, but the progression system is one of the two big draws that set this game apart - whenever you unlock an item or weapon, a copy of it instantly drops for you to try out. With expertly set pacing that keeps you unlocking something or leveling up every run until you have it all, every run for your first 50 hours is guaranteed to feel unique. 

The other big draw is just how much care went into making all of the little niche interactions satisfying. I've lost count of how many times I've run into some strange combination of scrolls and weapon mods, thought ""man, it'd be so cool if these worked like this,"" and then found that they were actually coded to work just how I'd hoped. Plenty of the interactions in the game are designed to be awesome rather than balanced - you can get builds that make you functionally invincible or blow up bosses in seconds, and the game is so much fun because of it. It's clear that the developer really enjoys playing their own game, since they'd have to have gone back time and time again to make all of the little niche builds they've thought of work in the most fun ways possible.

[quote] PLEASE NOTE: This review is/was written when this game was in/is still in Early Access. Think twice before buying/playing this game [/quote]

I've never expected to enjoy this game as much as I did!

Gunfire Reborn is a game developed and published by Duoyi (Hong Kong) Interactive Entertainment Limited

The game offers some nice graphics and some nice pixel art graphics, although some ugly glitches here and there, it is pleasant all the same

Gunfire Reborn overall, however, is a fun game to play, and it does get boring if being played for a long time, but is a very good action game and to play in short bursts even in it's current state of Early Access!

Although a bit short and barren on content for the time being, I'm sure that with a few updates down the line, this game will become a great rogue-like action game to play alone or with friends... which I don't have, sadly...

I have played DeadCells, a metric cock ton of Slay the Spire,ROR,ROR2 and other forgettable rogue esq games.

Gunfire is awesome..truly..It is probably the only game within this genre where I genuinely am excited to see how they progress the game further.
The combat is fluid.
The guns are pretty cool for the most part, some are shit and need balancing tweaks (iron man gloves..)
The art is meh imo.
The sound is passable. Nothing spectacular about the audio, but its fine. it works.
The gameplay loop however...is fucking fun..and addicting. Slay the Spire levels of addicting.

Fun looter shooter with in depth rogue-like progression. It's early access - but one of the most polished EAs I have ever come across. Gunplay is slick, good amount of variety to combat

Even at this early stage, I highly recommend giving it a shot. It's a great price for what you are getting.

My number one gripe so far is the localisation. The game needs a lot of work in regards to translation. The English is pretty rough with typos and confusing item descriptions.

- Why is there no melee attack?
- Stages begin to feel a bit samey, need more variety in the levels
- Need some way to customise hero to make us feel unique

At it's core, the game is a ton of fun, but certain issues need to be addressed.

1. Why is it treating it like I'm online when I'm in a solo game? Give the option to play offline solo so I don't keep getting frustrating, run ending lag spikes.

2. Stolen assets. Like it's pretty inexcusable for some of them. Certain one's I've noticed: 

- The Dragon Bone is just Zarya's gun from Overwatch. Similar in design, function, and I'm pretty sure in animations.

- The sharks in the 3rd stage are legit just Roadhog from Overwatch as well. Same hook animation as well as far as I can tell.

- The flamethrower dragon legit uses the Skyrim fire breathing sound effect. That one is legit just ripped from the game.

3. A better spectate or option for when players die. If you are playing muliplayer and you die, you are going to be having to watch the back of someone's head for the next 5-20 minutes, depending on where on the full stage you died. A work around for this would be not allowing yourself to use Soul Essence to revive yourself in multiplayer, but you respawn when you enter a new level portal.

The bonus with this is that when you restart a level after failing, it randomly generates the area and paths so it doesn't feel copy/pasted giving you a challenge without feeling tedious and gives you the opportunity to try out all the various, and rather creative, weapons.

Only (personal) issue I have is I'd rather have a double tap to dash on the directional keys that have it as a separate button all together. Again, that's just a personal preference.

Laser gloves is incredibly OP and needs some balancing imo, i just finished the game on Elite mode with a laser glove that I upgraded to +5, then got a lucky drop of one. I also had an occult scroll that took ammo from your reserve instead of your magazine, so that coupled with the laser glove made it ridiculously strong. The combination of scrolls I got was insane.

OP Build:

Laser Glove
- Coin Shot
- Mid-Air Strike
- Penetration Bullet
- Advanced Depot
Fire Ascensions/Grenade Ascensions (specifically +300% damage and decrease enemy dmg -50% and increase +20% dmg taken.

Advanced depot with Laser glove and Penetration bullet alone are really strong since laser glove dmg increase the longer it is channelled and Penetration bullet ignores shield/armor with crits (laser glove can crit). Advanced depot turns your reserve ammo into your magazine, so I had a Laser glove that bypassed armor/shields with a 1k+ clip.

Incredibly op and fun, but literally made the third world a cake walk. I killed the final boss without even taking damage as it took me like 2 seconds to blow up the cannons.

84,Gunfire Reborn,70367840,english,"Great, on-its-way looter shooter, but a lot of polish needs to be put into this before it's released to the public. Started my playthrough on solo - you're stuck with an uninspiring dash and grenade skill set coupled with an enemy-rooting CC tool on a long delay, then sent into a randomly generated dungeon with little fanfare. Enemies have the upper hand as your skills have long flight times and large collision boxes while their projectiles easily calculate cover and overcome you by surprise as you expect the same rules to apply to them.

You can argue all day that this adds challenge and a learning curve, but a balance team needs to first pick between ""looter shooter"" and ""tricky and unforgiving"". At least front-load expectations for a game that punishes you for not having full mastery of your abilities out the door rather than comparing it to Borderlands where you're allowed ""fight for your life"" and not be expected to think three moves ahead.

Also, the boss I fought two-shot me. There was no real lead up to this, or explanation that he was much harder than other enemies until that point. That was a little unforgiving and frustrating as my run unceremoniously ended. Other roguelikes like Gungeon handle this quite a bit better because you at least get a chance to learn when one hit = part of your healthbar, not most of it.

While it looks like a game with gear and equipment rpg  you restart without any every time. You do keep gaining skills and some other stuff but everything dropped is not yours after 20-30 minute dungeony thing is over. 

Another big negative that caught me off guard that is caused by the resetting loot thing. Whether you win/lose is not skill but 10000% rng. Yup get a bad weapon or scrolls (like ability modifiers) and you lose get right ones and its easy.  Which is not consistent gameplay. 

As most people are not me I came for persistent rpg charateristics and do not like the reset every time thing so while game itself is fun smooth best I can rate it is 6 out of 10 (for under 20 dollar ea game).

97,Gunfire Reborn,70364550,english,"To start this review off id like to mention this is probably one of the better rogue like games I have played thus far.
The gameplay: As every game you play, when you first start off it's quite challenging. The more rounds you play the further you will get. There's tons of weapons that players can use that cater to their specific play style. And not to mention a passive progression system that allows the player to upgrade their character despite having lost the run. 

Concerns with guns: So far all guns are viable but to get a game winning run, it really depends on the affixes the guns have. I've had really easy runs whenever I got a heavy base damage weapon that rolls either corrosion or lightening and if it rolls with 65% elemental damage you're in the home run. Due to these stats being in the game, it feels like I NEED them to have a chance at the last boss. Having a gun with luck chance + element conversion + decay + elemental damage and if you can get the 200% increased headshot damage it's probably the best setup you could ever get (i've gotten it once with the gauntlet and holy shit that was OP 20k per tick). From what i've mentioned before and you obtain a little more experience, you will start to end your runs prematurely until you get a gun with decent base stats, or that's how I feel about it.

Game Concerns: There's heavy amount of lag when entering rooms (This only happens in later stages for me) . When I get to the last boss it's almost unplayable, not because of lag but because the AOE move he does with the cannons registers before the phase transition it over and fires before I can move my character. Despite that bug when I actually can move my character and get to the next stage, the same thing applies, the cannons will fire the explosives before I can react due to the stage swaps. In the final stage of the boss fight, there will follow more lag + stage delay  and the bosses cannon move wont register a circle and will just obliterate me. ( I could be fighting the boss wrong but I dont really know the issue). I still havent locked a full completion yet but I've gotten really close, Not because of technical skill more so to my op guns. Every boss feels great besides the last boss. 

Conclusion: I really enjoy this game, but knowing that there's only certain traits on guns that will give me a run with ease can get a bit tiresome. That, coupled with stage lag and buggy transitions on the last boss make playing this game feel like a chore to get a win. Otherwise I would say this is a really solid alpha build I rate this a solid 8/10 at the moment.",1591412152,1591412152,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,170,13,2191,0,1493,1594614781,,

PACING - Fluid, not too fast paced, or slow. Take the game as fast as you want too! No timers or anything.

GAMEPLAY - The weapons and aiming feel really solid with a diverse unique variety. It is really exciting to find new weapons or try and find combinations that work well.

LEVEL DESIGN - The level designs are well done, where positioning feels very crucial. Often times, I find myself in a pinch because of where I am standing in relation to my enemies.

AI - The enemy AI is really good! This is a tough game, and it's not due to the enemies having scaled up HP bars, it's because they have some synergies that work together and some basic AI that is done well. Grenade launchers + bowmen? The grenades will flush you out, and the bowmen will snipe you. It's fun!

EARLY ACCESS - This game is in early access but it feels like a polished game. Best early access game I've purchased.

FUTURE - I am really looking forward to when they add more characters. I also hope they add more customization talent trees for each hero, as the general talent tree between all heroes has three trees, but the individual heroes have 1. 

Also, a suggestion I thought of: you could add a second set of levels that have a different weapon pool if you want to keep adding weapons but not dilute the current pool. (expansion?)

pros
-gunplay feels good, some guns feel as good as destiny's guns to shoot.
-movement is decent
-challenging; there's a learning curve so you don't just steamroll the game
-pretty stable for an early access game
-varied enemies with distinct counters
-gameplay loop is pretty intuitive
-runs great even on budget hardware
-difficulty scales with player count, so game stays challenging, engaging, and requires coordination.

cons
-you don't get revived in multiplayer until after the boss fight, even if you died in an earlier stage. should be changed to revive all dead players at the end of a stage.
-still has some typos
-missing an exp bar
-shotguns need buffs, the only way to make them viable currently is to have very specific set of inscriptions on them as well as certain scrolls
-first boss fight is pretty basic, could be harder without being impossible.

61,Gunfire Reborn,70345412,english,"Review for Single Player campaign. First, I'm no noob. Been hardcore gaming for 40+ years. Play most games on hardest difficulties. FPS Veteran. It's a fun game for the first little bit. I'm giving it a not recommended because it's in early development and needs a lot of tweaking. It's a fuc king grindfest. I'm not sure if this game is meant only for 12 year olds or anyone with no job, family, or prospects and can spend their entire life devoted to this game, but I'm not one of those. I don't have the time to put in 1000's of hrs just to get by the first boss. I have spent too many hours and the game is only getting harder (on the same level) as I level up. The level progression is sh it and doesn't work. The npc's are leveling faster than me. I'm level 16 and it's harder to get to the boss stage now. I don't want to play the same level over and over AND OVER again just to beat the first OP Boss. Add some more content!!! I got to the Boss most times. After grinding for days, I got my shields to 65 and my health to 90 (I think). Going in to the boss with the best set up I got (super lucky once) I managed to bring him from 80,000 hp to 58,000 ish. And I was on fire. 2 fuc king hits from the boss and you're done from full shields and hp. One hit for shields, one for dead. Seriously fuc king insane difficulty. As it stands I can't ever see beating the first level.
There first level has 5 ""sections"", including the Boss section at the end of the first level. The sections are ""procedurally generated"" within narrowly pre-defined parameters. Meaning that they change in minor ways. The first section is too easy, lulling you into a sense of false security. It's over quickly and section 2 is not much harder. Section 3 can be tough. Section 4 can be insane. The same enemies go from one hit kills to bullet sponges.
The worst part of the game is the bloody random everything! Random weapons, random power ups, random times. You can get to the ""end"" of level 1 with many power ups and weapons or little. You can wind up with one or two of the few decent weapons or complete sh it weapons. The difference in the weapons and power ups is HUGE. The right set up of power ups and weapons vs most shitty combos you're given is akin to how lame you are at the beginning of Skyrim  vs how powerful you are at the end. Not cool. Most of the time you're pathetically under powered in this game. 
There is only one character to play. The second has to be unlocked. The currency and system used to level up you character is sh it also. You get these tokens as you play, but I don't know what generates the tokens. They are probably randomly generated like everything else. After you die you can use the tokens to resurrect or not resurrect and get more tokens for leveling (I didn't know this for quite a while!). You get tokens  individually, which means you're always wasting some tokens. You buy improvements with tokens but everything is extremely expensive with increments of 10 and the improvements are pathetically under powered . Ex. lowest level improvement (1/5), increase hp by 5 hp, or shields by 5 or some other pathetic, useless ""improvement"" costs 10 tokens. So I made 9 tokens the first playthrough. Oh, I guess I'll save up for next time. The tokens DO NOT SAVE! You must use your tokens and any that aren't used are discarded. Fuc kyou! I'm at the point where I can't level up anymore. All the improvements cost 40+ tokens and the most I have made on any play through was 37 tokens. I keep playing and never get enough tokens to buy any improvements! They're gone if you don't use them but I can't use them because everything is too expensive! Unfuc kingbelievable.
Random power ups!? WTF!? I don't get this choice at all in single player. Just plain stupid, stupid, stupid. The power ups should be well thought out and allow many possible builds that require specific play styles but are ""equal"". 
Player control and choices are required to make this game succeed.
I WANT TO BUILD MY FUC KING CHARACTER THE WAY I WANT! Seriously, random power ups are destroying this game for single player.",1591381418,1591381418,FALSE,1,5,0.259118438,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,287,71,6967,57,781,1601044361,1591423337,"Hi,some issues you mentioned do exist, and we plan to make some adjustment.

72,Gunfire Reborn,70341496,english,"[h1] Strong Contender for Indie GotY 2020 [/h1}

If you're on the fence on this game, I'll save you some time: pick it up right now. It's worth much more than its current asking price. For less than the cost of a AA indie release you get 20+ hours of challenging, rewarding, and usually balls-to-the-wall crazy gameplay that evolves as you play. It's beautiful, it's polished, and its unbelievable that a dev team made this on their first outing. 

As somebody who enjoyed Borderlands 1 and 2, as well as Risk of Rain 2, this game feels to me like a mash-up of those two great games with a dash of Rogue Legacy's progression system to tie it together. The gameplay loop consists of amassing Occult Scrolls and increasingly-powerful weapons to blow away increasingly difficult stages of enemies and bosses, earning Copper (to buy in-game upgrades) and Soul Essence (to purchase ""Talents"", persistent upgrades that cross over between runs).  

Pros
-Insane variety between play-throughs
-Skill-based gameplay
-Tons of exciting combinations of weapons and scrolls to experiment with
-Excellent enemy variety, boss design, and balance (in its current state, the game is difficult but fair)
-Meaningful progression systems
-Beautiful presentation, including a crisp UI and a timeless art style reminiscent of Borderlands

Cons
-Early Access means there are plenty of audio, visual, and gameplay bugs that are still being ironed out, but expect these to be patched out as EA goes on (the devs are on top of it, check the patch history)
-Very difficult (some players may need quite a few runs before seeing success)
-Some weapons seem to be strictly weaker than others (unless you amass the perfect combination of Occult Scrolls), limiting the amount of real options players have if they want to succeed in their run
-The English localization can be confusing or downright misleading at times (I will say that the Devs are doing excellent work to fix this issue, with a patch having just been released today to correct some of the more important localization errors)
-Although there is plenty of content in the current version, there are only two playable characters to choose from, so in a 4-player lobby there is going to be a ton of overlap (no spoilers, but it's obvious from loading screens that there's at least one character the devs plan on adding)

Cats and dogs raining destruction on armies of evil henchies has never been this good,. In its current state, Gunfire is absolutely worth a buy.

- Guns and shooting feel solid and enjoyable

- Charmful Asian aesthetic artstyle that gives the game a lot of personality 

- Controls feel very solid on PC

- Lots of replayability and stuff to unlock/spend points on after runs

- Two characters with their own playstyles with more to come

- There's no melee attack which feels weird, it would be an improvement to see one added

- Some bugs/glitches, I had one bug where I would get stuck on terrain after dashes

- Lack of on-screen information, it would be nice have more hit markers and visuals to see who exactly is shooting at you and other dangers during a run

- Still some localization problems, ""Energy orb freeze enemies"" instead of ""Energy Orb Freezes Enemies"". ""When inflict fire dmg"" instead of ""When you inflict fire dmg"" etc. However information is still entirely readable and this is mainly just a small nitpick

- Missing some key features like a map and a teleport system

No matter how many hours I have in DOOM II and Blood, my skills in other fps games will not carry over.  Because if you want to win with skill, you have to first grind your way to the top.  That is not fun game design.  

While I don't particularly like Dead Cells (rogue-lites in general), I think its fair to use that game as an example of a rogue-lite done right.  You are only unlocking items that aren't necessary for the completion of the game.  You are not inherently more powerful or less powerful with or without the rogue-lite unlockables (other than the health flask).  

In gunfire reborn however?  Tell me how it goes when you reach the second area for the first time at a low level...  good luck...

There is a good game here, and I feel many reviews already point out the good well enough.  But it is buried under this grindy leveling system that just morphs this fun experience into an absolute chore to play.  

I will definitely continue to follow development, but until this system is either heavily altered or removed, I don't think I'll be coming back anytime soon.",1591366112,1591366112,FALSE,3,0,0.466981798,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,538,7,407,0,407,1591313410,1591423545,"Thanks for your feedback, current system is not perfect enough and we will optimize it, please give us more time."

I have yet to play with and master the second character, (I think his name is Ao Bai, AKA ""the dog"") whose playstyle is entirely different from the starter character, the Crown Prince, AKA ""the cat."" Additionally, I have yet to unlock all the weapons and scrolls, and I am only halfway through the permanent skill tree that persists throughout all your runs.

The cool thing about the two unique characters is that in order to use them effectively you have to build them each completely different throughout each run. The cat focuses around elemental damage, while the dog is useful for explosive damage and hard-hitting weapons. This means you will need to utilize different weapons with different modifiers, not to mention all the different types of scrolls that give you passive buffs and can create some serious synergy if you choose the right ones. This allows for a ton of replayability even if you have already defeated the final boss 5 times, and that is a great feat for a game that is only in early access.

These give you more maximum ammo, more max shield and health, upgrades to your specific characters abilities or even unlocking more powerful prefixes for the weapons you find in game.

24,Gunfire Reborn,70319749,english,"An absolutely brilliant roguelite, even its earliest stage. Although at the time of writing this I have almost 40 hours in this game, I also have hundreds of hours in some of the best roguelikes in my opinion, including The Binding of Isaac, Enter the Gungeon, Nuclear Throne, Risk of Rain 1 and 2, and slay the spire. Additionally, I have extensive experience in FPS, including 2000+ hours in TF2 and experience in the borderlands series.

Coming from that background: This game is good. Really, really good.

It gets everything right- On the FPS side, the shooting feels punchy and each weapon has its own unique feel. Reload animations are crisp, the crit sound is orgasmic and you get instant feedback. In terms of a looter shooter, the modifiers are unique and can make the same weapon feel quite different, and since the game has only unique weapons every weapon has a very fun cartoon aesthetic- And there isn't just FPS mainstays like SMGs, pistols, assault rifles and rocket launchers, but beam weapons, a kunai, or even a dragon or a lizard that you use like a gun.

On the roguelike side, its honestly surprising to me that another game hasn't managed to do this before. The sense of change from run to run in roguelikes as well as the skill involved in making choices feels like it'd be right at home with a looter shooter, and yet no games have really nailed it. Well, until now.

Whilst occult scrolls act like items in most roguelikes and the weapons are, as previously stated unique and fun, the ascensions really ties the whole package together, allowing for choice from run to run and a real feeling of building your own unique playstyle as each run continues. You tend to consider all three and end- One run you might be the crown prince using ascensions to make your energy orb massively CC everything, while another you might be spamming out grenades everywhere that debuff everything.

On top of all this, even though there are only two at the moment, each character does feel entirely unique. While the crown prince focuses on elemental weapons and CC, Aoi Bai is a complete rambo who loves explosive weapons and weapons with low ammo counts.

All this being said, it is early access. 3 levels, 2 characters, almost forty weapons and a ton of occult scrolls. If you want a complete game come back in a bit and have loads of fun, but for any diehard roguelike or looter shooter fans I can guarantee you probably at least 10 hours of fun- Or maybe even more than 30 like myself.",1591339539,1591339539,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,121,3,4951,302,2181,1601271389,,

So you dont always go for the same gun you actually look for what stats it has. Have 2 guys in the 30s as i write this and cant wait to get higher to get more skill points but i love that they added one to keep a certain amount of souls each round making it worth it to save some for the next upgrade. all in all i love the game so far. Def better with friends as most of the pugs i have found never seem to talk in game and when they do its all choppy so discord is a def helpful. either way get the game check it out and if you need some teammates me and a buddy are always down for grouping up!,1591328437,1591328437,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,172,5,4495,0,1189,1593559647,,
42,Gunfire Reborn,70314701,english,"[h2]Unfortunately--I can't recommend this game right now due to the ""grind to win"" mechanics""[/h2]

Wow.. I hate to do this but I am doing it mainly for the devs to see. I'm giving it a thumbs down which is awful stuff :( something I RARELY do with my reviews. If I don't like games, I typically don't bother giving them a review. So this game. Reason? It's near perfect except for one glaring issue I have--that it requires grinding. LOTS OF GRINDING!!!

I absolutely can't stand games that ask you to play them over and over and over, with each run, placing points into a system that makes you stronger for future runs until after 100-1000's runs your strong enough to win. That is super LAME. And unfortunately, this game is victim of that with it's ""Talents"" system. You play rounds, die, use points you earned from the round towards unlocks to make you stronger (more health, more damage, better stats/abilities, ect.). That's the WORST thing you can do for games like this. 

I'm heartbroken. I was so stoked to play this game and give it a glowing review but stupid grind mechanics??? I can't.. I can't recommend this and it kills me. I am a huge fan of rogues and I wanted to love this game and play the hell out of it but I can't. 

If they want to compete with the best action roguelikes, they must change this mechanic because it's.. well to be frank.. it's mindless and takes the skill of winning away. I don't want to play 50-70 hours to obtain the necessary ""talents"" aka ""upgrades"" to beat the game. That is horrible! Horrible.. I am surprised I've never read this complaint until I've made it but it's very unhealthy for games like this in my opinion and thus for NOW.. for now, it gets a thumbs down. It guts me.. 

I will say other than that huge elephant in the room.. I like it alot and see a TON of promise. It's a great little action rogue that plays as others said, a silly FPS similar to borderlands with some rogue'ish mechanics like permadeath and locked rooms like you've seen in games like Starward Rogue and Binding of Isaac. Music is amazing, graphics are amazing but man.. the ball got dropped on the progression..

Again.. I am sorry, I really am but.. grind mechanics as progression? I just can't sit by and say ""that's awesome"" because its lame as hell. If devs want a game that people will stick with for ages, they will need to change that because games that use that as a form of progression get left for dust. 

People either get too bored to grind up to be strong enough to win or they do it, then shelve it because there is ZERO reason to keep playing after you max your stats out. All in all, it's not a great way to keep incentive for people to play. There are much better approaches you can take to keep players engaged and reward progression, endless grinding to win is NOT one of them. 

Other than that major--lame issue.. I like it a lot and wish the devs the best on their future endeavors. This game can be HUGE but I don't see it getting there if the current form of progression remains in place and I am just being honest.",1591328133,1591328133,FALSE,17,8,0.515799522,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,409,41,97,0,20,1593274770,1591369566,"Hi, we'll re-evaluate our mechanisms especially the ""talent"" tree and keep optimizing them.

[u]Pro(s)/Con(s)[/u]
+Easy to pickup and play
+Fun weapons (Justice has best reload animation)
+Starting Character is very fun to use
+Wide Variety of builds are viable
+Cursed Scrolls (with their counter scrolls) give the game a lot of diverse game play
+Ammo/Grenades are easy to replenish and only high consumption builds have issues with ammo management
+Solo Play is very rewarding to play

-Co Op difficulty can be absurd with 4 people
-Lag Compensation/Net Code can end runs with rubber-banding or enemies hitting you with bullets/abilities from nowhere (this is being looked into)
-Vaults and Chests can really screw you over giving you either nothing helpful to your run or giving you something that hurts your build if you take it (I know its supposed to be fully rng based but setting a preference would not be a bad idea)
-Weapon Drops (I see either 1 weapon for an entire area or I see 8 its like there is no in between)

[b]Improvements (personal opinion)[/b]
Custom Runs - Most roguelikes have an option similar to this, the ability to adjust certain aspects of a run
New Areas/Characters - Im sure this is already in the works and so far I do really like the design of all 3 areas and both characters
Ping System - Only helpful for Co Op when pointing out a vault of an item you drop for someone nothing fancy

6,Gunfire Reborn,70292229,english,"This game is phenomenal, especially only being early access as of now.
I'll be talking about 3 categories:
-Graphics
-Gameplay
-Bugs/glitches
~~~
Graphics:
I love the graphics implemented in this game. They feel so simple, yet smooth and refreshing. The overall aesthetic of all the areas is visually appealing and definitely worth praise. It's also extremely easy to distinguish different sections of the map.
8/10
~~~
Gameplay:
Addicting. Just completely addicting. This game is balanced just right, posing a challenge yet still rewarding you for advances. You die, upgrade, and go through the map once more. The satisfaction of beating each boss is the best part. Headshots in this game are especially great. They do tons of damage, but still not enough to simply one shot a character. The weapons feel slick and easy to use, some being more difficult than others. I believe the scrolls could be a bit more balanced. Some just feel too good, while others feel completely useless. An example of this is the scroll that allows you to heal 1 hp / item/copper picked up. I personally think this should be nerfed or touched upon a bit.
9/10
~~~
Bugs/Glitches:
Not many noteworthy ones. However, during co-op, my friends and I have experienced some very noticeable lag. The game may freeze suddenly, with everything just sitting in place. Other occasions weapon shots don't register. I haven't encountered any solo (yet), thankfully. For early access, this game has much less bugs than other well known and polished games.
~~~

Admittedly it is still in Early Access (Like literally not even a month into it so far) so it still has a way to go. Some of the guns personally feel a bit useless or extremely circumstantial, while the kunai (Called Prism in the game) and the lightning ball/power bubble gun (Called Lightning Blast in the game) feel extremely powerful.

26,Gunfire Reborn,70284817,english,"WARNING - THIS GAME IS VERY ADDICTIVE

Born in the borderlands style of gaming comes this little roguelike gem that is not to be missed.
The game essentially boils down to a mini RPG in which you have a choice of hero (Only 2 currently) who then goes crawling into randomly generated dungeons in search of weapons, upgrades and a rare currency called 'Soul Essence' which is used to upgrade your abilities on the hero permanently.

You won't come out triumph though - You must push on until you die, on death you can spend any accrued soul essence you have so that the next run can be a little bit easier. You basically rinse and repeat this cycle over and over again, getting further and further each time you die (in true roguelike fashion).

The gameplay is very fast paces and feels very responsive, gunplay feels smooth and never really gets boring, there are MANY different weapons all with different perks and upgrades but it won't take long for you to find a favourite.
The level design can get repetetive but in a shooter where your main focus is - you know - shooting things, do you really care?

There is some kind of huge latency issue with multiplayer right now, so unfortunately I can't recommend it for multiplayer, however playing on your own the game appears to run very well and is a ton of fun.

66,Gunfire Reborn,70271192,english,"For the 30 hours that I've played this game, I highly recommend this game. For a cheap price of $11.99, you get a whole lot more. Firstly, the experience when picking up the game, it was easy to get the hang of, easy controls, minimal interface, overall, nothing to crazy. While advancing deeper into the levels, items, abilities, and weapons become more complex and revolve around whatever build you choose. Every run will be different, and there are a few areas you'll discover that you know it like the back of your hand. 

There are two reasons why this is probably one of my favorite roguelike game. First is the multiplayer. Every player gets their own items and own weapon drops. It isn't visible to the other players til you choose to drop it. No more race to get the loot or better items. On top of that, compared to my other favorite roguelike, you can DROP ITEMS! It's so nice to be able to trade items and weapons to the other player that fits their build for the run.

My second reason is the skill tree. I love unlocking new items and seeing them in my next run after completing an achievement. But it feels even better when you use the souls you've collected through the run to get passive upgrades like more ammo, damage, health, and when you get even further down the tree, free items, more souls, more money when you crit! It gives another sense of progression that your working toward something whether you win or lose.

I highly recommend this game whether it be single or multiplayer, the experience is great! You won't find a game this good for $12!",1591251803,1591251803,TRUE,0,1,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,40,5,2408,0,1783,1597979483,,

To start with, the shooting here is insanely tight. Every gun has a unique feel and sound to it, and you have a lot of weapon archetypes to choose from - you will most likely find a couple of favourites that you will want to focus on, but even the others are enjoyable to use when you have to.

The progression systems are very nicely thought out and create a very addictive loop of ""just one more run"" much like popular roguelikes such as Risk of Rain and Rogue Legacy. Each run nets you souls that you spend on a permanent upgrade tree to get better, and during each run there are several upgrade systems to get more powerful as you go along.

As it stands, the only weaknesses of this game is that it needs more content. That said - its incredibly cheap, and everything that is there is incredibly fun and well made.

Unfortunately the game is balanced heavily against the player early on. You'll end up playing the same level on a constant loop for hours just for some minor progression. Think Nes Era game developement. 30 minutes of fun stretched over hours upon hours through aggressive stat based difficulty. 

I understand The game is EA and brand new at that. But with competition such as RoR at least offering 2 level variety's per phase. And at least 4 playable characters or more from the gate. There's still some much needed developer love.

Picked this game up today and played for about five hours so far. It's a great game and very addicting offering plenty of replayability through random level generation, lots of weapon types to find, a large skill tree to unlock, and two characters (at the time of review). It's rogue-type gameplay means each run is different with a ton of unique character and weapon ""builds"" every time you play. It is rewarding to find new weapon and perk combos work with the weapons and perk choices you find throughout the run. I am very much looking forward to seeing this game develop - even this early in development it is off to a great start and offers many hours of fun at a very low price! The upgrade system is interesting, each run you'll accumulate souls, if you die you can spend a certain amount of these to revive ONCE per run or chose to end the run with your souls. After a run you can spend souls on persistent upgrades, BUT any souls that you don't spend are lost forever. This means to unlock more expensive upgrades (which you will hit within an hour or two of playing) you need to make it into and even past the second level which is, in my opinion, pretty challenging. What this means is eventually you'll hit a point where a lot of 10-20 minute runs will end, you won't be able to afford any upgrades, and you'll lose an entire run's worth of souls making the run essentially useless. As seems to be the norm for reviews here are some pros and cons:

[b] Pros: [/b]
- High replayability through random level generation in addition to loot and perk mechanics
- Very fun and rewarding shooter with good mechanics and solid gun and movement feel
- Enough persistent upgrades to work towards to reward continued runs
- Challenging levels keep each run interesting
- Highly varied perks and weapons provide a unique experience every run
- Private and match-made multiplayer, play with your friends or team up with people online
- Simple menu option to provide feedback on bugs, crashes, suggestions, etc.

[b] Cons: [/b]
- English translation is not very refined yet, this does not affect gameplay but is definitely noticeable
- Some in-game text (my guess is status effects?) are not in English, only noticed a few in five hours though
- Not being able to keep your unlock points between runs makes progress difficult once you hit your ""skill wall"" and are not able to progress far enough each run to afford upgrades
- Each run is randomly generated but in the same ""level,"" so overall environment and enemy types are fixed

Beside some much needed optimization, the concept is great. Just a couple things I'd like the devs to consider.

1. Add some kind of scrapping/crafting mechanic. I hate leaving loot and guns behind in previous rooms when swapping for new ones. It drives my OCD nuts. Perhaps we could break guns we don't want to use anymore down into scrap that can be used to craft bullets for example.

2. Please let us swap out the starting weapon. Unless I'm missing something, I couldn't figure out how to change it out 
 for new guns in all 3 slots. Getting rid of our only weapon that has infinite ammo is a risk I think the players should be allowed to take.

28,Gunfire Reborn,70223444,english,"Gunfire Reborn is the distilled essence of Borderlands weapons (culling a lot of the complexity and miniscule stat boosts on your loot so everything is pretty substantial and plays more heavily into builds and passive effects) built onto the foundation of a more linear Immortal Redneck. It's already a solid contender in the roguelike FPS genre and the cute graphics are just icing on the cake. There are a few issues I have which I'd like to see addressed, but even this early I feel like the game's already a fine investment of your money and time.

There are a few major points of frustration, at least in my experience. I feel like the pool of unlocks is hit or miss - the more awful options that are added to the drop table, the less chance you get one of the ones I consider essential. Movement speed, especially, feels like a stat that's almost a necessity, yet there are only a few scrolls that improve it... and even one that actively hinders it, if you use the wrong damage type! I would like to see some way to add movement speed through the end of level rewards, and I think some of the worse upgrades could be replaced with that. [spoiler](seriously, does anyone pick ""first 5 shots while dual-wielding do double damage, but halve the duration of dual wield?"" It goes against the very nature of how that skill works and the damage buff is almost meaningless when so many other effects give almost as much buff, more easily, without side effects. IMO, turn that into 40% move speed in dual wield and I'm happy~)[/spoiler]

I also think some enemies are a bit overpowered. Standing totally still too long should be punished but I think there's too much of a prevalence of enemies that rapid-fire homing attacks. Honestly, the homing could be toned down (look at Dark Souls archers) so that as long as you're moving you'll be okay, but standing still, even if you moved right after the shots were fired, would still be a bad idea. I've seen too many good runs end just because a couple of those enemies spawned in and immediately fired volleys toward me before I could realize I wasn't moving perpendicular to them. With the range they have and how quickly you can be overwhelmed from all sides (not to mention when you're slowed, that effect is enough to make those attacks guaranteed to hit) I think it's overkill. The player can't effectively respond to that.

But mostly, I think the game's really good, still quite fun in its current state. Definitely a recommend, but I'm hoping they will fix some of these pain points in the future.",1591160433,1591160433,TRUE,1,0,0.523809552,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,461,13,3266,0,1379,1599194308,,

Besides those points, my biggest complaint about the game is the loot system. All of the weapons that drop have random effects on them such as ""Increased damage when enemy has this debuff"" or ""increase fire rate"" however, instead of adding excitement to a already good weapon, it seems to make you look for very specific effects otherwise the weapon is bad. This more often then not, leads to runs where you are slowly slogging through the levels because you're weapons are so extremely weak.

**The Art/Design**

The levels and different type of enemies are a piece of art, I love it. I hope there will be more enemies and level soon with more difficulties.

**Gameplay**

This game has this, I need to try again because I know why I died and next time I will do better, vibe. It is fantastic! Almost everything in this game feels fair. The guns are great and the game is optimized perfectly.

**Customization**

Now I love how much guns there are and all the script you can unlock but I wish there was this thing I could do to give my own signature to the characters in game. For example I am sure I am one of the first to complete the game on Elite, a cool cape or something would make it feel much more rewarding ^^

**Suggestions**

There however a few things I would like to see changed/fixed. 

1. The walls in this game are a bit inaccurate. With some weapons you can detect enemies before you can see them and this goes for enemy projectile as well, especially those who curve.

2. Some hitboxes of the heads of some of the enemies are really weird and inaccurate especially the lizards and ducksnipers.

3. There is a bugg in Elite, where in level 3 those ninjas who teleport towards you and start spinning do not do any damage! 

4. There is this one parkour level in level 3 that is simply not doable... at least not without the triple dash scoll.

5. The triple dash scroll is OP! It is so easy to complete the game with that scroll (both difficulties

It's hard to do GR justice through pictures or videos, but what the game lacks in visual polish it makes up for in spades for a really incredible core gameplay loop. It's a simple concept, take the gun mechanics from Borderlands and stick them in a permadeath roguelite. And it works. 

Oh boy does it work. 

If you've played any of the Borderlands games then the inspiration is going to be pretty obvious right away. Drops are going to be one of many ""templates"", which then have a chance of rolling various different perks, such as increased crit damage, bigger magazine size etc. The shock + corrosive + fire elements from Borderlands are also there in pretty much identical form. However, GR isn't afraid to tweak the recipe when needed, such as allowing you to + 1 your gun at randomly spawning merchants for cash, letting you keep your weapons base stats up to snuff against the ever scaling enemy hordes. While it might be less than original I personally see the overall combat system as fans building on foundation Borderlands laid down as opposed to a direct ripoff. 

In terms of negatives the only glaring issue is the occasionally lackluster english translating. Other than that there are the usual signs that this an early access game made by a small studio, repeated assets, simplistic level designs, reused assets, the odd bug here and there... But I can honestly say that none of these things detracted from how much fun I had, and for 12 dollars full price plus the heads up that it's an early access title I'd say even with these issues it more than exceeds expectations. Gunfire Reborn is clearly the product of a passionate group of people, you can see the love in every detail from the characters you can play as (an indterdimensional cat prince or a dual weilding bear) to the finely tuned loot and progression mechanics.

Elemental damage to specific health/shield/armor will be very familiar to borderlands players!!!
Lots of Progression trees and nodes
Easy to pick up
Challenging at the later stages

Cons:
Limited levels for now
Some enemies archetypes feels very unbalanced and will shred you like swiss cheese
Some build types is very OP and can carry you thru the levels if you have good RnG early on
No resource sharing in co op

21,Gunfire Reborn,70178250,english,"Even in its early state the game is a great time, well worth the price. It's like a mix between borderlands and a rogue lite (Ziggurat might be the best comparison if you've played that). The weapons are varied and fun by base with meaningful & interesting stats tacked on, the goblet character progression system gives you a sort of baseline control over the direction of your run, and the scroll item system adds the unpredictable random spice to the run where you find one that is particularly neat and start playing around it. The permanent progression system between runs is a neat way to get some incremental power sort of like a version of bl3's guardian rank system: noticeable and meaningful but certainly still less important than what an individual run offers you. Toward the bottom of the tree you start seeing some really powerful options, but getting there takes a while and won't hurt the integrity of the core gameplay I dont think. It just provides some more incentive to keep playing and grind out those upgrades.

Gameplay consists of fighting through a couple zones (differnt color styles, enemy types, and room layouts) divided into a few floors (one guaranteed goblet character progression item per floor) divided into rooms (which individually hold enemies & loot). At the end of every zone there's a boss. The enemy targeting is relatively simple, so when you get hit it feels like it's your fault for not properly dodging, but with a wide variety of enemy types each with slightly different ai makes it so situations still call for attention still; overall they feel great to fight and learning how to fight different enemies feels rewarding. In terms of your character, you get your starter weapon, two additional weapons you pick up during a run, and two skills. Currently both characters have grenades as their second skills, but even those grenades feel different to play with since they function slightly differently and have different upgrades (not quite as diverse as borderlands grenades but getting close). The primary skills are vastly different and both are a good time to use. I should also mention that of those two weapons you pick up during a run, you often swap them out constantly as you find straight upgrades or just better options for the situations your facing since each zone has its own parts that are particularly challenging, so you will rarely ever hold one for the entire game (though the option is there to do so if you find one with particularly hot modifiers by spending some coins to keep it up to par with current progression).

Both online and solo work great. I, like most, have enjoyed online more when playing with a private lobby among friends, but the matchmaking is there and works great if you like that more. Multiplayer feels fairly balanced right now compared to single player, even though in MP you get the ability to revive downed teammates along with 1 optional solo revive while in SP you only get that 1 solo revive (which costs a lot of the permanent progression points you've earned for the current run, so it feels like a real choice to revive or not). Singleplayer is a great time too and I've done a number of runs there as well.

There are some translation issues right now but they're minor and still get the idea across just fine.

Overall, great game, and considering the relatively low price, certainly worthwhile even not on sale. To quell some early access fears, even if it sees no updates from here forward, I still think its worth the purchase for the content it has now.

i saw this game on the steam store for only £9, looked quite cool and seeing as we are in a big lockdown and ive completed my whole steam library, twice, i bought this game and played it without any knowing of what it is. i was met with a fun charming game that gave me a fast paced looter shooter vibe, i played a few games and i had a lot of fun, i enjoyed a lot, however after 1:30hrs, ive come to realise that it is a repetitive, extremely difficult roguelite thats quite boring. The grind of getting all kitted up with the finest weapons and scrolls fighting until reaching that final boss and killing him with just an inch of health left just to be met with another relentless 5 levels that will last no longer than 20 seconds if that. My problem with the game is that it seems every time i load the game and play it, it feels like what im playing for is just useless. im not much of a roguelite player, ive played ror2 maybe twice for no more than 2hours but after my experience with this game, i dont think i will be returning to this genre. You load into the 1st level and your instantly put into a close quarters room most of the time during the early game with a pistol and about 5 enemies and thats it, over and over until you make it to the last levels where instead of just running round the same rocky corridors and rooms, its a fuck fest wave game with large amounts of enemies spawning that are incredibly difficult to kill with your awful weapons and useless scrolls. And when you end that level and make it to the desert level, your health is already so low that unless youre god himself and have not lost much health the first level, youre instantly fucked in the next level as the bosses are even harder and stronger, and to top it all off, once you die, thats it, you go back to the main menu and restart it. I guess once you rank up this skill tree thing it will make it easier but that must be a grind of the same thing for hours i am not willing to endure. 

PROS
- Cool cartoon graphics adds charm
- Unlocks that adds slight replay value 
- Rewarding but harsh
- Fun with friends
- Cool weapons
- Unique abilities 
- Rank up systems

CONS
- Boring after 2hrs of grinding
- Extremely difficult
- Pointless playing 
- Only buy one health kit for ONLY 30% once every so often
- End bosses can 2 hit you with ease
- Variation of weapon and scroll setups but only few are actually effective 

I will be keeping this game in my steam library as i do actually enjoy the game, and somewhat recommend it in ""its not the best it could be right now"", but the devs seem to be ontop of things and are pumping out updates frequently so thats a good sign, and for a low price of only £10 in early access its an alright purchase but limited enjoyment.

Im leaning more towards a Yes Recommendation than a No which may surprise you from all the shit ive just talked about it, mainly because i know this game will be great in the near future and just needs more people to play it and see it for its greatness and weaknesses, and they can decide for themselves what to do with it. It has much potential and i really hope they can pull through with an update that will bring me back for more.

70,Gunfire Reborn,70172759,english,"Early Access Review: Recommend, but....

The game is good, especially for EA. That said, I can't really understand the resounding praise this game is getting. The level maps are extremely monotonous, with little enemy variation and and little to offer. Weapon upgrades add a little spice, along with gaining access to ""restricted"" areas like Vaults. Your character moves very similar to characters in Overwatch: vary labored with small jumps and a short dash. That's not a negative, it just feels a bit jarring compared to your typical FPS movement. 

Its a Rogue-Lite, so you will die. The levels leading up to the boss won't present any challenge, then the boss will two-shot you into oblivion before you have a chance to think and then it's back to the beginning - rinse, repeat. You gain orbs to spend in your talent tree, then you go again.

The game needs longer, more complex levels to keep things interesting. I can't help but think of other rogue-lites, like Risk of Rain and Dead Cells, that absolutely killed it with level design and length. The levels need to be fun and rewarding. As of right now, they aren't. The arena style rooms have less fun and excitement than a 30 year old Doom clone. 

That said, the art style, combat, and weapons are great. The first run to the first boss was a 5/10, the next attempt was a 6/10, and so on. So, this game grew on me, and I'm pretty hyped to see what the Devs manage with this game. A solid FPS rogue-lite with killer weapons and fun, challenging bosses is exactly what the doctor ordered.

It can be a little tough at first, but since this is a roguelite you will gain more and more power as you go. You gain currency for your progress, then spend that currency to give permanent upgrades to your character. 

I am not fond of the platforming puzzles you encounter starting in chapter 2, even though I loved the platforming in DOOM Eternal and Titanfall 2.

6,Gunfire Reborn,70164618,english,"I expected a lot more from the reviews, but truth be told this is a super slow paced boring and grindy game. It's graphics have charm, the foundation makes ya think it could be pretty good, but u go through a handful of rooms easily every run(like pathetically slow and easy pacing) and then you get to a boss that isn't possible to kill cause he kills you in 2 hits and has insane amounts of health. I get it you gotta grind your talents up to be able to take him on...but the game of going through a handful of rooms to die on a boss over and over until I eventually grind that exact same thing over and over is lame. I did a handful of runs, they were all the exact same, not what the dev broadcasts, the portals to dungeonlike puzzles for 2 year olds that anyone can beat or ""challenge rooms"" that are literally the exact same thing cept the enemies drop a minion like enemy that takes 1 shot of any wep to kill when the original enemies die(which isn't challenging at all).

Idk man I have no idea how people are calling this risk of rain meets borderlands, it's not even close to either. It's so far away from either of those 2 it's making me wonder if I'm the only person with a brain on steam anymore. This game is just a boring grind how does it have this much love? If you wanna play rougelites there are infinitely better options available out there this game was a letdown and made that very clear as fast as possible. Nothing about it makes me feel like i'd wanna put 10+ hours into it, and when I think of the best rougelites they are games I can see myself always coming back to even if it's just for a run or 2 but always coming back from time to time.

I've played some really good RNG runs where I will melt everything and other times it's been scarce but fun. You never seem to play each time with the same items in the same order so it makes you think of alternate ways of getting past bosses or levels with different gear and guns. 

I'm surprised this is still early doors as the game is very good, yes some things have shown themselves but over the course of 22 odd hours I've had 0.0001% of things make a mare but nothing that has stopped me being able to carry on.

Gameplay loop is really well done, only thing I would complain about is that the dash move is very unpolished and does not feel very smooth when using it (I'm playing on a 144hz monitor and the dash animation feels like 60 or hell even 30)

Game is not very demanding, I run it at complete max with a steady 225 fps.

Maps are good but more variation in layout would be nice (less hallways in early areas). I understand that later areas are bigger but that makes the first twenty minutes of a run a pain to get through. 

Make sure to let me know if I'm wrong about stuff I actually want to not misinform people on some things

Overall for a game that's only $11.99 currently and made by a smaller team this is a ton of fun. Small stuff here and there do bring the experience down a little bit though.

50,Gunfire Reborn,70151411,english,"A very good FPS rogue-lite, and while it is Early Access I will say it has some major outliers namely the first boss Wu Lu hits like 10 trucks and will 1-2 shot you commonly until you get some of the rogue-lite perks. 

In general though, the game is great. Best way I could explain it currently.:

Difficulty - Risk of Rain style. Longer you take tougher it gets. 
Weapons - Imagine if you only had Legendaries from the Borderlands series. Every gun is fairly unique, though not exactly the best for everything.  These guns become ever more unique as you gain the ability to find Unique-on-gun perks for each gun. 
Example: had a sniper with While scoped for 1s highlight enemies through walls. High-lit enemies are always counted as Crit-hits. 

Leveling up - Much like Rogue Legacy, You get currency for killing enemies, bosses. Every run you spend em or lose em and start anew with your unlocked buffs. These range from basics like Ammo reserves, or more HP, to exclusive weapon perks like mentioned above.

My biggest complaints would be Wu Lu the first boss needing tweaks. Recently got to the second boss and it felt insanely balanced / fair, so I think Wu Lu just needs a major once over by the devs.

 And it takes a bit long to unlock the second Character, If it unlocked quicker it would help  some of the repetitive issues of most Rogue-lites. 

Final note, it has 4P coop! So you can shoot and loot with buds too!

If you're a fan of quick fps with rougelite elements this will easily be your jam. There are plenty of weapons each with their own style of gameplay and getting a run with the right occult scrolls (items) and ascendancies (character specific perks) that synergize with your build can really take you off. Two example runs I had that really popped off.
-Prism is kunai with 1 ammo and there is an occult scroll that gives you 50% bonus damage on your first shot of your magazine, giving you permanent bonus damage on that weapon. 
-I ran a grenade build that stacked grenades (ended on 32 with the cat prince) and grenade damage along with a lightning assault rifle that gave 65% bonus damage on enemies affected by elements which also came with shock. When you combine any 2 elements in the game they have a bonus elemental effect that occurs (i believe shock + decay results in a stronger damage over time effect that decay gives). I would just toss grenades like mad and fire away until everything was dead.

The big thing I want to end on is this game awards skill over everything. Enemies hit like a truck but for the most part it is fair. Aim is everything, if you don't get good you'll get punished hard. Even with a god build, you still need to be able to avoid enemies and take them out quickly as in certain areas you will be gunned down in mere seconds if you stay moving or keep enemies clear (looking at you tall bandit in stage 2).",1591013753,1591013753,TRUE,1,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,110,3,1521,0,390,1598687506,,

The weapons and builds are fun to use, and there's a decent amount of content here already. Once they add new characters, weapons, scrolls, stages, etc, then this game will be incredibly good.

Pros:
+ Fun combat.
+ Decent weapon variety with a playstyle for everybody. The throwing knife is my personal favorite.
+ Good enemy variety.
+ Lots of progression, both macro and micro.
+ Borderlands-esque loot system.

Cons:
- General lack of content that comes with early access titles. There are only 2 characters and not that many levels. But they're definitely going to add more at some point.
- Some deaths can feel extremely sudden, especially in later stages. Enemies can unexpectedly tear through your health with little warning.
- No melee weapons seems like a crazy missed opportunity. 

Neutral:
+/- Grindy as hell. This is a turn off for some, and a selling point for others.
+/- Difficult. You won't be beating the game on your first playthrough, or your second, or third...

98,Gunfire Reborn,70133757,english,"This game has potential, but I'm not sure I'd recommend it in its current form.
Sort of a disclaimer: Yes, I've played RoR2, I've played DOOM (old and new), I've played Borderlands, and potentially unrelated, Ziggurat & Immortal Redneck.

I would honestly veer away from saying the game is a mishmash of the three, since a lot of elements are missing from them. Borderlands I can kinda see, since all that I really take away from that as far as gameplay goes is random stats on guns and skill trees. Doom, you got the dash and I suppose rooms full of enemies, but lacking the satisfaction of blowing enemies apart. RoR2.. It's a roguelite. That's it. The scaling difficulty feels more like Enter the Gungeon, which my experiences consisted mostly of ""Haha wow, I have garbage weapons and the health is inflating faster than the economy.""

As for Ziggurat and Immortal Redneck, those were both games with dungeon layouts akin to Binding of Isaac, but in the FPS format. Having clocked 100+ hours into Ziggurat, the mechanical failings of the game started to show, but it's still pretty solid. Immortal Redneck felt like a step back with a ton of unsatisfying weapons and the same sort of post-run progression tree that this game has.

So what's the point of me bringing all of this up?
Truthfully, I'm not sure now that I've written it. Maybe it's because it doesn't quite feel like this game is truly the ""lovechild"" of those other titles as some have said. If that were the case, I feel as though the skill tree would be something that you progress in the middle of a run in perhaps a chaotic nature at a fast pace, you'd have incredible mobility with a means of quickly executing enemies at close range, and the weapons would feel distinct but just random enough that stuff dropping seemed exciting. Currently, we have a dash and some pretty okay gunplay.

I'll probably keep an eye on this game, as it seems like it could absolutely grow into something fantastic. For now, it's a bit unrefined.

If you come from RoR2, Borderlands 2, or even Doom I think this game is pretty solid for you. I was able to beat the final boss and I'm still not done with unlocking everything. If you hate grinding games, this one isn't probably for you.

PROS
- Dev seems to be very responsive and listens to feedback.
- Randomized Loot genuinely changes up the loop. It could be from having a oneshot shotgun to burning 
   madness.
- Gameplay is pretty smooth and enjoyable
- Visuals is pretty interesting and is not an eyesore

CONS (So Far)

10,Gunfire Reborn,70131078,english,"Gunfire Reborn is an exciting and surprisingly in-depth looter shooter, which many have compared to Borderlands and roguelites. The initial gameplay compromises of shooting enemies, getting upgrades, dying, getting permanent upgrades, and repeating. This is not an issue for most people, including myself, but I feel that this game could get boring very quickly for more puzzle-strategy oriented players.

Pros of the Gunplay:
Weapons are very unique by themselves, and also get additional characteristics called ""inscriptions"" which can range from a simple stat boost to dramatically changing how the weapon works itself. Inscriptions can make or break a weapon in this game, so it is [i] critical [/i] that you make sure you understand them before picking up a weapon. Weapons also gain more inscriptions the longer a run goes on, so weapons continue to feel unique and different, even if you did pick up the same weapon in a previous run. Weapons also use one of three different types of ammo: meaning you have to make interesting decisions as to what weapons you choose to take, as you can only carry 2 weapons.
The gunplay by itself is also very smooth: weapons feel interesting and satisfying to use.
Cons of the Gunplay:
I am sure this issue will be resolved in the future, as this was written during early access. This issue being that there aren't quite enough weapons in the game. Even if the inscription system makes each weapon unique, that can only go so far as weapons will inevitably become boring. Another issue I have is with grenades- throwing them feels clunky and not as quick as it should be. This doesn't sound like much, but it really distracts you in those heated moments.

Pros of enemy and room design:
I think that this game handles the whole ""procedurally generated level"" better than other roguelites. Instead of changing small aspects of the level, it instead adds or removes rooms, making a different pathway to the end. This is done well, and rooms don't feel very boring, even if you've seen it already. The game also occasionally throws small challenge events at you, usually in ""vaults"" (the game's version of secret rooms) which can really mix things up. Enemies also are unique, having easily choreographed attacks that are easily dodgable with enough knowledge, and good visuals really tie the enemies together. Bosses are also great, providing actual challenge while being completely doable.
Cons of enemy and room design:
The rooms themselves in this game don't really provide much: just a battleground for you and your enemies. This can lead to the game becoming boring very quick as the rooms feel empty once all enemies and loot are cleared out, providing no reason to stay or enjoy the visuals. I think puzzles or other small challenges could really improve the levels and provide more reason to pay attention to the environment around you. I also think that level variants would be a great addition too, to break up the monotony. I have no issues with the normal enemies, but bosses are a little bit unfair sometimes. The reaction speed to need to dodge the first bosses' rock throw attack is crazy, and is extremely difficult to dodge if your dash skill is on cooldown. And don't even think you can dodge the slam attack he does. The second boss has two phases, the first being unfairly difficult, and the second being way too easy. The laser in his first phase is almost undodgable, and will rip through you easily. The second phase is just a joke: the tail takes critical hits almost anywhere, the projectiles can be destroyed, and it only creates more waves as it's health goes down. No issues with the final boss, though.

Pros of Balance, Hero, and Permanent Upgrades
The balance in the game's single-player mode is fantastic- the enemies seem fair and the bosses are challenging but possible. Despite there being only two Heros to chose from (The Crown Prince and Ao Bai) the amount of thought and detail that went into their temporary character upgrades (called ascensions) is well done and thorough, and complement their playstyles well. The visuals for these characters is good too (having the color of grenades change on your character is a nice touch). The permanent upgrade system, called Talent, is done well too. To upgrade it, you need soul essence, which is collected from monsters along your adventure. The soul essence can't be brought along though, (without a certain upgrade) so you need to plan out your upgrades with the amount of essence you have to ensure you're not being wasteful. The upgrades are interesting and useful, so it always feels like you're stronger in your next run.
Cons of Balance, Hero, and Permanent Upgrades
As the run goes on, enemies feel a little bit bullet-spongy and deal too much damage. Slipping up can prove fatal most of the time, as it's usually enough to kill you immediately. The temporary upgrade system (not with your characters) are called scrolls: they range from stupidly overpowered (deflection shield) into being nearly useless and detrimental to pick up (brutal gloves). This can be very frustrating and not fun to deal with late in into a run, as being punished for picking up upgrades or making the game too easy is unfair to the game experience. I'm not going to count there being only two characters as a downside, as more will inevitably come, but the issue lies in their complexity: this can be really confusing for new players and a major turn-off. The permanent upgrade system is flawed in my opinion, too. The later on upgrades require stupid high amounts of essence, which can turn a game in which you get stronger every playthrough into more of a grindfest than anything else. 

Miscellaneous Pros:
The devs are [i] very [/i] active. They usually fix bugs within a few days, and will email you as well to make sure you're satisfied with any fixes they've made. I have a lot of hope for the dev team and this game! :)
Steam achievements right out the gate is fun and offers some more things to do other than the in-game challenges.
Miscellaneous Cons:
The multiplayer balancing is a little iffy. Enemies with x3 health on a two-player run?
If you die on multiplayer, you have to wait until the ENTIRE STAGE is over before respawning. Not level, STAGE. Meaning that your teammates will have to deal with a beefed-up boss by themselves.
The translations in this game are a little confusing and inaccurate sometimes. Not a huge issue as you can mostly make out the meaning, but a small issue for the mono-lingual among us.

Overall, I highly recommend this game. A great casual experience and lots of detail for the more hardcore players as well. For only $12, the amount of content in this game will deliver. If you have no problem with the issues above (and they'll probably be fixed or changed) then this game will easily deliver a solid 20+ experience for you.",1590990954,1590990954,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,54,5,1600,0,1017,1598134750,,

13,Gunfire Reborn,70130663,english,"First off, Thank you Mr. Streamer (aka Woolie, big Risk of Rain 2 d00d) for giving this game the limelight for 10 minutes. It took only 2 for me to be interested in it simply by the title of the video, combined with it being on sale. Secondly, I'd like to scold the fuck out of Steam for not informing be about shit regarding this game because holy fuck is it an absolute blast, but more on that in the actual review.

Anyways, Gunfire Reborn is and will be an amazing indie title (if I'm allowed to call it that) for a while simply because of what it does and how it achieves it. Going back to Woolie's video, this has the same fast-paced dodge n weave n blast n bash style gameplay of Doom / Quake, the replayability of Risk of Rain 1/2 and Enter the Gungeon and Binding of Isaac, on top of the weapon uniqueness of the Borderlands series. With the addition of extra hidden chests and ""vaults"" that can give you that extra edge to come up on top with special power-up scrolls, new perks to your weapons, and even bonuses to existing stats and abilities, it's easy to think you're completely overpowered, until you hit some kind of brick wall.

You will be on your toes in a matter of entering the first area after the Tutorial, needing to go between finding cover to not get hit and dodging between enemy attacks as you hit them. I managed to get to the first area's boss right after the tutorial, only to die after getting him down to a sad 10%-ish heath and dying, netting me an achievement. It only took another 4 hours of trying, and trying, and dying, and trying before finally getting Lu Wu down and defeated, only to die in a matter of seconds after entering World 2 Area 1. On top of that, multiplayer scaling is a little nutty, with the first boss's health boosting from 8k to 24k with 1 extra, then up to 40k with a second extra. Thankfully, you don't have to share and fight over loot in this game, so when you open a blue scroll chest, everyone gets a unique scroll. (Plus, if a friend needs a certain gun or if you want to be generous, replace a New Gun with an Old Gun your holding, then replace New with Old once again, so you can drop the New Gun for your teammates to enjoy.)

Replayability is exactly like those previous three games I mentioned earlier. In GR, you have set Worlds that you must progress through various Areas, each Area containing separate Sections. There are 4 Worlds, each World has 4 Sections, with 1 final Boss Section afterwards, and each Section can have anywhere between 1-4 Areas. Each Area has a chance to contain cracks in the wall that, when shot with any weapon, can open a portal to a Vault, leading you to a secret puzzle Area that allows you to fight / wavedash your way to extra Power Scrolls. It's easy to see which Areas you've been through in past Journeys before, but sometimes you go through a different doorway and the new Area is from a different part of the sequence from the previous Journeys. Much like Enter the Gungeon, you might be in the same Chamber as before, but the rooms are spread out and connected differently every time, with different chests, secret rooms, shop items, and boss(es).

To combat this challenge, you have Weapons and Power Scrolls. Weapons range from a starter revolver, to a grenade launcher, to a wooden crossbow, to a tiny dragon that spits fire, to a black hole launcher, to a power glove that shoots a beam of lightning, each with unique and varying stat bonuses that all tie in to a big giant message of, ""If you keep me and build around me, everything will cease to exist and nothing can stop you."" Combine the weapon perk of, ""Land 3 consecutive crits, gain 200% Lucky Hit Chance."" with a Power Scroll that states, ""Bonus 200% Crit Damage, but -50% damage when not hitting a crit."" so you can literally take a weapon doing 50 damage per tick, and reach crazy highs of roughly 2k damage per tick, all the while extra bonuses of elemental damages and bonuses from the Goblet. It's absolutely nutty, but hurts like ripping off a wax tab when something nukes you out of existence and ends your Journey.

Despite being early access, I have only encountered two major 'bugs'.
 - Sometimes during Lu Wu's charge attack, the player can backpedal and prevent Lu Wu from attacking, keeping him charging until the player can kill the boss or messes up the backpedal. This may not be much of a bug, but it was most likely not an intended feature.
- Only twice in my 37 hours of play so far, have I experienced massive lag down to around 7 FPS that lasts until I die or pause the game for a significant amount of time. The rarity of these FPS drops make me unsure of the cause, but they did seem to worsen if i faced the direction of where I spawned in the stages of the 3rd area.

43,Gunfire Reborn,70123277,english,"[b] [u] A FIRST IMPRESSION REVIEW [/u]

I don't leave reviews for many games, but I felt like I had to leave one for this game. At the time of writing this I put a bit over an hour into the game and while that's not a lot of time every minute of it was pretty enjoyable so I decided to list a couple of the pros and cons that I've found so far.

[list] [u] Pros: [/u]
[*] A lot of the guns can be useful, with different inscriptions on guns each run, the same weapon can be completely different from an earlier run you had.
[*] Even for being in early access there is quite a bit of different passives that really give the game it's ""rogue-like"" feel.
[*] The gunplay feels fun, while the guns don't pack the boom and effects of a game like DOOM or Destiny, it's still fun in it's own right.
[*] Going back to the guns, I've had a few runs where I just had a hell of a time choosing between some of the guns because I just couldn't decide between a gun with really good inscriptions that I liked using, or trying out a new gun that seemed really cool and could've been really sick with some of the passives I had.
[*] It's co-op though completely capable of being played solo.
[/list]

[list] [u] Cons: [/u]
[*] With the developer being located in Hong Kong, the English is hit or miss sometimes, though this isn't really a big deal.
[*] There is only two characters to play at this time, though I imagine more will be added later on.
[*] You may not understand what passives and abilities quite do at first with the wording being a bit strange, but this can be easily figured out by just playing around with it a bit.
[*] There is items you can get to fix this, but the starting moving speed in my honest opinion is very slow, which can make fighting the first boss and dodging attacks from enemies harder, though I'm sure with more time I can overcome this.",1590973618,1590973753,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,111,3,958,0,80,1596931766,,

4,Gunfire Reborn,70099169,english,"Gunfire Reborn is the rare gem that feels like it shouldn't be nearly as addictive as it is.  Generaly roguelite shooters make the mistake of being afraid to have powerful synergies in their builds.  This is understandable from a design pov because shooters don't feel good when success is balanced by back end numbers more than by twitch skill.  Reborn instead allows for interesting and fun builds to change your play style.

The Good:
Visual design is unique and interesting.
Enemies feel fair for the most part.
Levels are well crafted for the game play that's here.
Weapons feel good and the ammo economy is surprisingly well balanced.  You cant use nothing but your rocket launcher but running out of ammo and being stuck with you pea shooter is rare if you don't use two guns that share an ammo type.
Game is entirely able to be played solo.
KB/M controls are very smooth and totally rebindable.  Indie games and even sometimes AAA studios have an infuriating habit of making WASD unchangeable but not here fellow EDSF peeps you're all good here!

The Bad:
Localization and translation is very poor and needs to be addressed quickly.  I'm aware these kinds of things don't ultimately effect game play but the game struggles with some item and skill descriptions because the English grammar is almost indecipherable.  In addition to that poor grammar just gives the game an amateurish vibe it doesn't deserve. The game play here isn't amateur.  This is a professional game that's quite impressive and it shouldn't be held back by poor translation.

The Meh:
Game desperately needs a bunch of cosmetic customization.  It's a roguelite playing a pre-made character but it's also MP and cosmetic progression is a must if the game wants to have a long tail (no pun intended...ok maybe a little).
The dash ability needs a bit more range.  You don't want your dash over powered of course but you want it to feel impactful there's a significant CD on the dash so it seems reasonable to allow it to have a bit more oomph.
Movement speed is quite slow.  Like very very slow.  This is unusual for a game like this.  There are progression items and scrolls to improve it but it feels a bit too slow at default and I don't think it's necessary.

An absurd value here and well worth supporting.",1590936088,1590936088,TRUE,1,0,0.513274372,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,159,14,3766,0,96,1600705115,,

29,Gunfire Reborn,70081974,english,"This game is mechanically similar to Dead Cells: you go through levels, die, progress your character, and repeat.; similarly, there are finite weapons with varied modifiers. 

In terms of gunplay, it's pretty similar to Shadow Warrior 2 but less bullet spongey. It's an FPS and you shoot and dash; you also click on people and you click on their heads. Enemies *will* feel bullet spongier during co-op play as the game scales enemy health based on the number of players. 

The enemy design is pretty good too - it feels like you actively need to know what the enemies are and what they do. The first stage doesn't really do this justice, but the second and third are really fun.

And the bosses. Man, the bosses. The first boss is somewhat generic but still action packed. The second boss shocked me. And the last boss was just a pure moment of 'oh shit'. The boss design was an unexpected surprise.

There's only 3 stage types throughout the game (at the time of writing); however, the second two stage types really feel more open and varied than the first.

Sometimes runs are dictated by RNG drops and you can get screwed over pretty early, but usually that's shown pretty early on and runs aren't always that long.

Also the game has some poor English translations at the moment. Still, these translations don't detract from the overall experience and I don't think I ran into a gameplay related issue due to faulty translation.

I have yet to beat the game, though I can say with each death and each progression I am having genuine fun with the game. Of course, I do have some gripes about somethings, but I am sure it is either designed intended or that this game is still early access.

The Story:

I believe there isn't necessarily a story but there are some small hints as to explain the reoccurance of enemies. As for the characters, you play as a roaming feline who goes by Crown Prince, accompanied by his demolition gun happy partner Ao Bai as they proceed to fight their way through trials and challenges with the ability to never truly die and find out what is the root cause of this phenomena.

The GOOD:

-There are currently two characters to play with, each with their own hero abilities but a permanent progressive system. Ao Bai is unfortunately level locked at 30 (meaning you are stuck with the Crown Prince until level 30). Bright side is that Crown Prince's progressive system get's carried over to Ao Bai. the only thing you need to unlock wtih Ao Bai is his hero abilities.

-A permanent progressive system. With each death, learn a little more to help you combat the challenges. Enemies drop Soul Essence which are the currency used to level up your hero, giving them helpful advantages with each playthrough. Heroes have their own abilities to unlock, but keep universal abilities when unlocked first time around. You don't lose your abilities on death, but add into the stuff you find throughout your dungeon runs.

-Loot and Shoot. While it may feel like a hero shooter, this is a rouglike game, meaning that with the weapons and items you find will give you plus or negative advantages through your runs. Upon death, you do not keep these weapons (aside from the hero's starting weapon) or items and must find them again with progressive advancing.

-Co-op: This game allows matchmaking and invite co-op. While there are only two heroes currently (with some more planned) you can join up with buddies to run the dungeons together or when you hit level 10, you can join in lobbies and help out struggling players.

- Devs listen: The devs are humble and very attentive to player problems. There is so much passion and care into this game and the devs are open to hearing problems and feedback and will work to fix the issues. Great for a healthy playerbase and some integrity that some companies aren't really known for.

Now for the BAD:

-Enemies hit like trucks. It almost makes me feel like this game was intended to be a bit of a movement shooter as well and while you have the ability to dash out of the way, if you get hit, say good bye to your shields and your health. I don't find this much of an issue, but it will bring frustration to those that progress a little further. I have a gripe with a certain group of enemies. Aside from the bigger ones that tend to rush you down, there are some that keep back and have all the movement to them and weapons that home in on you, breaking your shields and then downing you without so much problems. I feel that the homing snipers need to be actual shot your can avoid and the homing ones being later into the game rather than right off the bat. They are the only enemies I have an issue with. Cover excluded.

-I don't find this as a bad thing, but it can be a turn off to most players for whatever reason. Levels are procedurally generated. Each playthrough will have different rooms in a dungeon stage, complete with a boss at the end. While I find it refreshing to keep interest, some players feel it is bland and not unique to games to have procedural generated content. It makes no sense to me, but that's something that I feel should be pointed out.

-Some enemies will ignore collision with their shots. Even when you take cover, some enemies shoot through the cover and either nick you or you come close to being hit. I've had this happen with the sniper enemies more than anything else. 

-Bosses have the health pool of a raid party. Upon being intimidating at first glance, you'll notice that the first boss has a health pool that you can't help but feel you need an entire raid party to deal with. Bosses hit like trucks and it takes some doing to defeat them. You can beat them solo depending on what you have currently, but with the game in early access, there are some issues that bosses end up doing that screw you over more than intended. In the end, the bosses are designed for four players to take on and while it is doable with single player, I feel bosses should be scaled on solo runs with the progression that you made in your leveling.

- Translations: While you can understand most things, this isn't a game with english as it's primary language. Translations are from Cantonese to English and may sound off when reading item descriptions. The devs are actively working on making them understandable so if something sounds a little off, just know that they are working on fixing the translation.

To sum up, this game is pretty addictive and while I have yet to gather friends to play it, I find that the game does have its' heart in the right place of where it wants to go with a passionate dev team behind it. The game is a rouglike hero shooter with loot and shoot to scratch that replayability itch with challenging bosses and dungeon runs. There is even an elite mode where they are tougher and numurous if you feel that you got too powerful for the game and want greater rewards.",1590902072,1590902072,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,304,7,1281,0,900,1591023025,,

50,Gunfire Reborn,70071611,english,"This is a pretty fun game for $12. The movement is reletively slower than some other roguelike games, but it makes up for it with the rewarding feedback of headshots. This review is written as of 5/30/2020 in Early Access stages of the game. Take what I say with a grain of salt. Or with the whole damn salt shaker.

Pros:
- I haven't encountered any game breaking bugs, or even some small bugs for an early access game.
- I love this kind of art style, and it works well with a game like this.
- Lots of guns for an early access game! Of coarse you don't get to keep them after you die, hopefully you can find another on another run, but there are a lot of weapons for an early access game like this.
- Skill tree in the rogueLITE is cool. I like roguelikes, but I hate not being able to hold onto any progression what-so-ever. So the skill tree helps me get my progression fix. 

Cons:
- There are only 2 characters! I am hoping to see more characters in the near-ish future of this games development cycle. 
- Some of the buff's you can get while you play don't feel too impactful, But I didn't get too far into the game to notice some of the buffs even working. (only got a little bit beyond 1st boss).
- Some of the indiana Jones sections (rolling rocks) are a little overwhelming when it comes the number of rocks it spawns. 
Suggestions for Dev's if they read this
- Work with your multi-lingual community to get other languages in the game. Also to fix some of the ""broken English"" that I've been noticing. 
- Add some characters soon! I'd love to see some more characters added. 
- I hope you don't end up under chinese rule. I want to see more work like this come from your studio, and that could be in jeopardy if chinese controlled.

The only real complaint I have is that in the middle of a fight it is kinda difficult to tell that you are taking damage. Specifically, I find that I rarely notice that my shield is down. I realise that when it brakes there is a noise and it creates a breaking effect on the screen but I found that in a fight I don't notice it. I think that the current noise of your shield breaking mixes in too easily with the other sounds in the game and makes it hard to notice. I think having a more distinguishable sound will greatly improve this issue. I also think that having a noise that lets the player know that the shield is recharging would help as well. There may be one but I didn't notice it.

My run just ended because i was walking next to a wall towards the entrance to the next room. A shotgunner in said room shot me through that wall without any line of sight and one-shot me.

Had a blast until then, though !

Game doesn't run super smooth, music gets repetitive, balance might be a bit off (i'm just 4 hours in, can't say for sure yet), but all of that is to be expected this early in development.

Guns are varied, well designed, sound great and look awesome, feel amazing to reload etc...
Upgrades are also varied and complement each other to form weird builds and it's lots of fun to find all those combinations. I just wish we had more control over our upgrade path because most things just randomly drop or come from chests with a choice from 3 items of a category which might contain 8+ items, so sometimes you're just gonna have bad runs because you only find the weaker ones early on.

You can't be carried by your gear however, as all upgrades improve your guns/grenades/abilities which still require you to land them properly and even have special conditions like requiring you to land headshots to benefit from them, which is great !

Game is hard however. As said previously, you can get destroyed insanely fast by enemies. It's intended to push you to use proper placement, prioritize targets, manage resources and all to survive. A side effect of that is that sometimes weird AI behavior or unfair room/enemy spawn combinations can (rarely !) end a run instantly.

I trust those issues will get fixed soon, and the game is so cheap anyway that you won't regret purchasing it.

Some cons would be a few balance issues with some guns feeling like trash, movement speed is pretty slow especially when carrying anything that isn't a pistol, a few enemies being a bit too unforgiving killing you from max health in less than a second or you asking yourself ""wait what even killed me?""(looking at you longbow men and bird bandits). And maybe a bit shy of content at only 2 playable characters and a fairly small pool of overall weapons which quite a few of them are pretty trash as stated above. Surely these will be ironed out with balance and new content updates in the future so hopefully some day the cons part of this review will become irrelevant.

41,Gunfire Reborn,70013277,english,"[h1] Summary [/h1]
A really fun loot-and-shoot that shows a lot of promise. It takes elements from all of your favorites in the rogue-lite, loot-and-shoot, and broader competitive FPS genres and melds them, quite successfully, into one title. At $11.99, this is a steal, especially if you have friends you can play it with. 

I purchased the game in the infancy of its Early Access period. If the team forges a good relationship with the community, there is the potential for this game to truly be an all-time legend in the Early Access program. 

For an Early Access game, it runs remarkably well. So far, I've only run into one bug with a boss resetting his position during combat--nothing run-ending; just annoying. The game is stable and playable. 

[b] Pros [/b]
+ Easy-to-play/hard-to-master core mechanics.
+ Permanent upgrades between runs in addition to randomly-rolled weapons, skills, and talents that appear in each run. There is a healthy amount of variety that should always lead to each game truly feeling like a ""New Adventure.""
+ Challenging, but not frustratingly so. Combat with each individual enemy matters. The bosses, though quite tough, are very dynamic encounters.
+ The game launched with 60+ weapons, 100+ skills, a massive permanent upgrade tree, and three unique ascension trees for each character. 
+ The ability to unlock challenge levels within each level to risk it all for better gear. 
+ The weapon variety is fantastic, allowing for different types of play patterns. 
+ Weapon tooltips give a lot of information, showcasing the level of complexity and depth in making your build. (Initially, this will be a lot of information for you to get on the fly, but you'll get used to it and come to appreciate it.)

[b] Cons [/b]
- A forgettable soundtrack. 
- Not much diversity in level design. You'll quickly feel like ""I've been here before."" 
- There are definitely some translation/localization issues. Usually, it's harmless, but there are some tooltips that are confusing.

51,Gunfire Reborn,70008847,english,"The game has serious potential but I do not recommend it until some serious changes are made. I don´t know why everyone is avoiding commenting on the serious flaws of the game. 

The structure of the game is that of Risk of Rain, where you have a run that progressively gets more difficult as you progressively get more powerful. The first sequence, however, is almost impossible to complete even for someone with thousands of hours in shooters like myself. 

Even on the first stage in the first map, getting hit by one attack from an enemy does between 1/4 and 1/2 of your total health, and that's just one monster. On the third level you run into a spear throwing enemy whose attacks can be difficult to dodge when you're paying attention to other enemies or if they rush you, and their attack literally does 1/2 of your health. In this game, the only way to regain health is to either buy a health pack that you CAN ONLY BUY ONCE and that only heals 30% OF YOUR HEALTH. And you only run into this vendor once or twice per 6 stages. Otherwise you can very rarely get an enemy to drop health but this has happened to me maybe twice in over an hour of playing this game. 

The biggest problem is the scaling of the enemies. They get incredibly strong incredibly fast and you are not at a stage to counter them. Maybe later in the game when you have done a ton of runs and have progressed through their leveling system that increases your base stats might you have a chance. Otherwise, getting hit ensures defeat. The only way to have a chance is to have serious RNG luck on your side. If you don't get a good enough weapon or good enough scroll drops, you have no serious chance of making it very far which is a disappointing development flaw. 

The first boss is basically impossible. I've beat him 1/5 times, losing on runs where I had a strong kit of weapons and scrolls simply because he is way too freaking powerful. Everytime you die to him, the game mentions that you have a dash and can avoid his abilities, but the dash has a 3-4 second cooldown and when the dude pushes on you, you have no way to dodge his flurry of attacks especially since for his rock throw, the dodge doesnt even get you out of the AOE damage so you physically cannot dodge the ability unless you have a certain scroll of you manage to position yourself behind a pillar to block the attack which is hard to do when he runs so much faster than you and is basically on top of you the entire fight. 

One attack from the first boss almost kills you so if you are missing any health at all, you're instantly dead. Are you kidding me? How is that a fun mechanic within the first 10 minutes of the game? And on top of that, there arent health pots so if you get hit once and dont die and manage to regain your shield, the next time you get hit you're dead. To make matters worse, he has so much health and goes to regenerate his shield shortly after you break it, so it takes such a long time of wearing him down before you can kill him. Additionally, these pillars people mention that you can use to avoid his damage randomly break, letting through the remaining damage of that attack without you having any way to avoid it. I have also had this boss kill me by jumping through (not over or around) but through the pillar which is absurd.

The only way I was able to kill this boss was by getting a lucky scroll that gave me three dashes which allowed me to successfully stay so far away from him he couldnt kill me easily. Yet he still killed me once and I only beat him thanks to the revive mechanic that works once.

All in all, I am incredibly disappointed with this game because it has so much potential and frankly feels so good from a gun and abilities stance to play but there are serious developmental flaws with the leveling and scaling of the game.",1590781933,1590781933,FALSE,6,23,0.406945407,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,146,1,891,0,242,1598120842,1591326742,"Thanks for your feedback, most of issues you point out do exist, and we will fix them and optimize the game in the following update.

Rogue-lite aspects are finding weapons (which are all creative as hell. for example, wrist mounted tiny dragon that acts like a flamethrower,) upgrades to your core abilities and elemental damage at the end of every arena, and scrolls that buff you and occasionally have downsides. Its a rogue-LITE because there is permanent progression in the from of talents. Stuff like ammo capacity, health/shields, and some special ones like getting a free weapon at the start of each run or the ability to shoot purple walls to unlock secret dungeons.

The Borderlands in it comes with the elemental damage mechanic, general gunplay, weapon stats, and the enemy health. There are multiple elements that work with one another for beeg damage (for example, corrosive damage + fire damage = explosion.) all weapons drop with random stats and modifiers, and once you buy the upgrade for it, intrinsic perks (for example, pistols can drop with a 25% chance to instakill on headshot.) Each enemy is unique, and have the health pool of an enemy from BL (hard to explain, but thats what it feels like.) There are bosses at the end of each level which require 4 stages to get through, and in all of its glowy fashion, they die in a lootsplosion.

The Doom comes from the arena to arena combat, with a heavy emphasis on staying mobile and dodging whenever you can. A bit unforgiving at times, but wheres the fun in easiness?

TLDR; this game is the bastard child of some of the genre respective greats of our time and is incredible. plus, early access, meaning more content!

96,Gunfire Reborn,69954630,english,"This game is going to be big.

Lets get to the reason why you will love this game, and get addicted. 

- Replay Value - Think of all the amazing roguelites, risk of rain, binding of isaac this game will keep you coming back, some runs gives you lemons and you need to make lemonaid.
- Fast paced 
- High frames per second and optimized 
- Quick thinking skills needed, make sure you put your quake hat on.
- Variety, no run is the same and you unlock new things as you go along.
- Weapons are soooooo satisfying to shoot, the sound and feel you will love it. 
- Great art style
- Devs are listening and communicating well, write to them in game, literally send them feedback inside the game.
- Challenging until you work out the mechanics and still you will be hard pressed in some places because of the randomness.


If you love shooters like borderlands and like the satisfaction shooting interesting weapons, the reload sounds, the way the guns feel, this game will make you smile, you need to use your awareness skills, situational perception, using pillars and the map to guard yourself as well to dodge things.

Mechanics, your hero has a special and a grenade slot, and it's different for each hero this will only get better the more heros they add, you also have dash on a small cooldown to dodge attacks which you will need to do a lot.

The items you are given mid run are random and you can get god runs or get really bad luck and need to work hard, but even things like your basic dash can be buffed by random items you pick up, reducing its cooldown or % chance to refresh it on use, those types of things. Items have elemental damage on them or other interesting effects so each run you kind of need to make a build as you go with what you find, there is also things such as in slay the spire, where you give up certain health to get special items. There's weapon crafters you meet mid game to spend money on to buff your current weapon or a shop keeper that sells you things you might want, again.. all random.

It's so far really fun, it's cheap and you have nothing to lose but you WILL have fun. Good Luck! Happy fragging.

Additional info 

- Headshots, if you got good aim you will do well, everytime you hit the head you will get a sound to tell you.

- Shoot vases on the floor, you could get health if you're low, but it's rare.

- There is an ingame timer on the top left of the screen to see how fast you are going if you're into that sort of thing, this game will be huge with speed runners.",1590690498,1590725811,TRUE,27,2,0.666085482,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,206,89,564,0,136,1590839952,,

The combat is unlike anything ive played before, your character is very slow to begin with and dodging becomes about careful timing. Your character is also very underpowered to start with and makes you earn every little boost, picking up a double dash ability is a huge deal in this game. But even being slow and underpowered with only the starting gun you and your enemies are already satisfingly leathal. Each enemy explodes into different kinds of pickups upon death and progression is constant. 

There is a novel mechanic where by you gather a secondary currency during the run which can be used to buy permanent upgrades for future runs OR can be used to revive you on death.

You can select one of the hero’s, each with his/her’s different strength and weaknesses
You have to shoot your way through different stages until you meet a boss.
Along the way you collect coins, ammunition, Guns from killed enemies or chests, coins can be used for upgrades at vendors.
Each enemies has different combat styles and the AI is not to bad in attacking you and trying to avoid of getting hit.
With progression in the game you also earn Talent points, these can be used to further boost your abilities.

[b]Things I did not like: [/b]
The “dash” feature take really time to get used to in order to doge attacks or enemy fire.
It’s a very short dash and on a pretty long cooldown if you in a middle of a fight (I know, it’s just a few seconds but it feels like an eternity)
Boss fights take a long time to get used to and once you died, you start at the beginning of the level and need to clean all again before try to kill the boss again, the grinding can get a bit tiresome, but it does mix it up and each run is a bit different.
Some balance features, if you run in group and your team members die, the game does not balance and adjust that you maybe suddenly play alone and not with your friend anymore.

55,Gunfire Reborn,69890391,english,"This game is Immortal Redneck, with Risk of Rain 2 and Hades influences.  I see people mentioning Borderlands, but the guns aren't procedurally generated, which means that each and every one is unique, but designed by someone.

At its core, the game runs like Immortal Redneck.  You choose a character with its own abilities (right now limited to a cat and a dog), get a basic starting pistol, and you're off to the races, fighting through different temples collecting cash until you inevitably die, and go back to the beginning to upgrade and start again.

The Risk of Rain 2 part comes in with the co-op and items that you get.  I understand Immortal Redneck also had items (scrolls), but those could be positive or negative, and these are pretty much all positive buffs to your character, which is more in-tune with Risk of Rain 2's standard chests (not the Lunar pods, though).  Level progression feels more similar to RoR as well, with each level culminating in a boss before you travel to the next biome.

The Hades influences are very evident in the goblets (these would be boons in Hades) which allow you to upgrade one aspect of your character at a time, be it elemental, through your magic orb, or through your grenade.

I don't have a ton of time in the game, but I bought it today and these are simply initial impressions.  If you're a fan of rogue lite games at all, I'd say this is a worthy buy.  It's $10 at the time of posting this, and definitely worth the money.

If the game changes for the worse or better, I'll update this review accordingly, but at the time of writing, I'd say this is worth your money.

Although as far as I know, RoR does not have persistent passives, where Gunfire Reborn [i]does[/i], so you feel like you are a little stronger after each death.

The shooting mechanics seem good to me, though I'm not an FPS specialist.
A few notes:
Passives/Talents are small, permanent boosts to your character.

Occult Scrolls are big buffs you can find on a given run, but which only affect that run (until Game Over).

There is an active dodge on a ~3s cd.  You can dodge in any direction, including forward for a small speed boost.  Occult Scrolls can affect this.  I found one that was -50% cd.  Another one I found added additional charges to the dodge.  In short, the game has a dodge and knows it, and it expects you to use it.

Headshots/Weakpoints on every enemy.  Usually it's the head, although some tanky enemies have it on their backs.  These ones usually charge you, though, giving you an opportunity to sidestep and shoot them in the back.

Guns have a wide variety, skirting sci-fi and fantasy, although most weapons operate in a satisfying, conventional way.   No guns that produce spiders or that teleport you or that fire projectiles that bounce endlessly around the room.  Or at least, none that I've encountered.   Most just fire a projectile that either hits or explodes.  The most exotic weapon function I've seen so far is with one particular lightning rifle, which fires energy rounds, and has a rclick secondary which spawns a blue orb which increases your damage if you shoot through it. 

You start with a pea shooter with infinite ammo which automatically increases in power to match your least powerful aquired weapon, so it never becomes obselete and you always have it.  You move fastest when you have this ""initial weapon"" equipped, similarly to how some games have you move faster with a melee weapon out.

Other than your initial weapon, you can only carry two guns, and you lose both on Game Over.

Other than the infinite ammo your starting weapon uses, there are three types of ammunition--Normal, Large and Special.  Every gun you find on any given run will use one of these types, and it will affect the capacity of that weapon.  In general terms, you can carry a lot of Normal, a moderate amount of Large, and a small amount of Special ammo.   There are passives which can increase the max you can carry, and some Occult Scrolls play with ammunition as well.   For ex, I've seen Scrolls which give a chance to double the ammo consumption of a secondary attack while increasing the damage, and one which causes ammo you find to go directly into your magazine without reloading, and another which will refill the weapon you have out with any type of ammunition you encounter rather than the specific type it uses.

There are grenades.  The ones you start with on the Crown Prince character are low damage dot grenades, but if you keep selecting buffs during a run to empower your grenades, they can become very destructive.  They are easy to aim, as they have an obvious telegraph, and they explode into a green AOE pool which harms enemies but not you.  You start off being able to carry 3, but there are passives which can increase this to 8, and there are scrolls which can more than double that.

There is a signature power on a short cd (guessing ~20s?  can b affected by passives/scrolls) that you use with E.  On the Crown Prince character, this makes your character throw a purple orb in a straight line which stuns enemies in a small radius where it impacts.   Shooting enemies frozen in this way increases damage.  Again, there are passives and scrolls which can affect the function of this ability in several different ways, including removing the stun and increasing the damage, increasing the power of the next shot after using it, increased area of effect, and so forth

There are four damage types--Normal, Fire, Electric and Corrosive.  Weapons can either apply the damage type on hit, but some only apply the elemental debuffs for Fire (burning) Electric (+dmg taken) and Corrosive 

Weapons can spawn with mods that increase their damage against enemies suffering from these status effects--sometimes on weapons which don't actually produce them, so there may be situations where it is desireable to apply elemental effects with one weapon and finish them with another.

There are shopkeepers who sell healing, grenades, ammunition and a selection of weapons, and smiths/enhancers who will upgrade weapons you have.

Once you finish a boss, the game saves and you can resume at the beginning of the next area, so you don't have to do an entire run in one sitting.

78,Gunfire Reborn,69680242,english,"So, 30 hours in, and i'm just going to post my review of this that I left in the community section, that has improvement recommendations. TL;DR It's an amazing game that needs a bit of work, but is AMAZING so far. 

Hi, i've been playing this with a friend, we're both fans of rogues, i've about 800 hours in Binding of Isaac Rebirth with 100%, and nearly finished Gungeon 100% before checking this out.

So, these are my thoughts about the game so far. Keep that in mind, these are opinions. First off, if the dev is reading this, please do not nerf anything in this game. Don't nerf the bosses, the enemy HP scaling in coop, nothing. Most people I guarantee are used to playing something like borderlands where the game hands you a free win and haven't played something like Binding of Isaac where you are going to die. A lot.

Here is why coop is not broken, or impossible, or whatever. Four players means four times the scrolls. You can drop scrolls. This means with two cat and dog characters, you can make the perfect elemental builds for each of them, about 70% of the time. If you're putting points into crit damage, you understand how busted elemental stuff can be paired with max crits, and with four characters doing elemental/grenade damage, it gets crazy.

There is no '100% win' method, because it's a roguelike, it's not supposed to have one. It's supposed to be punishing, RNG oriented, and designed for replay value. That being said, the more you level up, the less RNG there is. Making the shopkeeper's stuff free, and increasing his inventory, you're nearly twice as likely to get good scrolls.


So... What should be fixed?

Is the game perfect? No, it's not. The low hanging fruit is the translations, which are being addressed. I think there are weird spots in the jumping puzzles that aren't mandatory to be fixed, but should be. You can do all of them without jumping boosting scrolls. My friend and I also have a strange, game breaking texture glitch that's occurred rarely. It isn't game breaking, but it's pretty distracting. I can't say what triggers it.

Meta guns. The lightning gun, the flame thrower, the prism (kunai), the bone worm, these four are very very meta weapons, and they are pretty easy to proc if you want to spawn with them after unlocking them. It's up to the devs to either make the other guns as good, or to just leave them meta, but there's really no point in only having a few viable weapons, since it's so easy to get them, and braindead to farm ammo for them. I am missing four weapons, I can't say how good the rest of the weapons are, I also play as the cat, while my friend plays as the dog, but he seems to agree that the weapons we use are the best. If you get the hawkeye perk, the bow is one of the best one shot weapons in the game, but it's definitely an idealist's weapon.

Scroll rarity/worthless scrolls --

One of the most confusing choices to me was the rarities in which each scroll is in, and why some are even in the game. Of course, I get that some have to be bad, it's normal, but why in this manner? Here's an example : Brutal Gloves. They give you a raw 35% damage buff, and REMOVE CRITS. Crits are the lifeblood of the game, you will not beat the game without them. Raw damage will get you nowhere, and every time I see someone accidentally grab this item, they drop it. So why isn't it a curse? Then, here's an opposite example : Final Judgement! One of the BEST scrolls in the game! It kills enemies at -20% HP, dealing 1,000,000 damage once they reach that threshold, and kills bosses at 10%, which sounds small, but is huge! What's the issue? Final Judgement is a NORMAL scroll. WTF? Why isn't it at least a rare? There are legendaries that are worth less than FJ. Not to mention, the legendaries kind of suck.

Deflection shield makes you take 90% more damage up close, and the opposite when you're far away. 99% of builds are going to be pretty close up, and in world 3, enemies pull you close and encourage you to come closer. It's not a very good item. Should it be changed? No, I think it's a okay item, just not legendary.

There are lots more examples of this, like Gormet being a normal, or ""Against the Flow"" not just being a curse item (because it sucks), but I don't want to get into that, or only sound negative. I do have an opinion on scrolls that were done perfectly -- the curse scrolls. They're pretty balanced, they're worth taking a chance in getting, none of them are really run-ending, and best of all, they are removable!

As far as tips go, I can only really speak for the cat. You need to be focusing your early upgrades on elemental effects, you need corrosive ready by boss 2, then you need ranged by boss 3. Remember to always search for Vaults and ""sacrifice chests"" (the red ones, that's what my friend and I call them) and if you're playing coop, SPEC INTO INVINCIBLE REVIVE! It's a great ability, and you can't die while reviving! It's not nearly as broken as it sounds, but it's essential for the third boss in coop. Singleplayer and coop are equal, but the players all need to carry their weight. i don't recommend playing this in matchmaking, just because you want to always trade with your teammates, and this game requires cooperation and strategy.

All in all, I think this is a great game, it could pass for a full game, let alone early access. No DLC BS, just a great rogue, fun as hell too. If this is really you guy's first game, it's sick. I love it so far. I can't wait to see more classes, and please add customization! Time trials would be fun, challenges a-la binding of isaac, maybe a random weapons run or a survival mode to grind souls. I think it's great, and it's changed my views on Early Access.

That being said, i'm playing this game quite a bit in two player, and my friend and I are always down to drag someone onto the battlefield with us, as long as you're a team player. Here's my discord if you want to play.

I wasn't disappointed at all. The controls feel tight and the challenge is there. It's definitely meant for you to play through this multiple times to unlock permanent passives to make your next run easier. The closest game to this would be Immortal Redneck which costs about 2 Gunfire Reborns.

The graphical style is also nice. Colorful! I love colors and games that just have a drab brown and green palette are boring to look at.

I do very deeply recommend getting some buddies to play with, while the game is very enjoyable on its own, having more people generally means an easier time. Enemies scale up with each additional player, but players can effectively trade weapons and scrolls (in-game modifiers ranging from downright harmful to I AM BECOME DEATH), meaning you can customize builds and create truly ridiculous combos.

The ONLY issue I've had is the few bugs that have been encountered. That being said, this game JUST came out on Early Access and is still very early in development.

19,Gunfire Reborn,69737790,english,"Hi,

Only played the game for a little bit but I have enjoyed every moment. I picked up this game without any research and had no idea what to expect. This is a fun, enjoyable and chilled game to play either on your own or with friends!

The idea behind the game is to make your way through the levels, killing enemies, unlocking areas, upgrading weapons, upgrading abilities, looting a variety of weapons and killing the end boss to progress to the next level. If you die you go right back to the start and the dungeon you are in changes 'route' so in theory no playthrough should have the same 'route/setting'. You can buy items and upgrades from NPC that are located in the level (which is a nice addition). 

There is a good amount of weapons in the game that have different stats which allow for fun playthroughs. The weapon system is similar in my opinion to Borderland weapons (with the different stats changes etc). All the weapons dropped in game are random.

There is a skill tree that you can upgrade via essence you get from defeating enemies and you can level up your abilities and stats by collecting in-game items (also in game items can boost your characters etc). Skill tree is fun and I would have to unlock all abilities to say whether they work or not etc.

I have no got all the way through the game yet (died on the 2nd phase ha) so not sure how many 'full levels' there are right now.

I would pick this up and just have fun, it's cheap and it offers decent replay value (the levels are pretty hard on solo, not sure if the game increases difficulty based on more players).

These are things I would love to see in the game (some may already be in the game or some may be on the 'upcoming' patches etc).

More maps - (places such as Snow settings, swamp settings, village settings, castle settings, Mountain settings)
Melee weapons - (would love to dual wield swords, use axes, spears, shields etc)
Armour - (I'd like to be able to equip items that boost your hero, head gear, body gear, foot gear etc)
More hero's in the game (more abilities for the hero, at the moment we only have one main ability and a second ability)
Wave defence - (I'd like parts of the game to make you defend an area, you can buy defences such as barries, auto turrets etc to help you and depending on how you perform in the wave defence you get better rewards etc)
Pets - I'd like to have companions that could maybe join you and give you buffs ( would help people playing solo perhaps?)
PVP (I'm not sure how to title this ha, I think it would be cool if you could compete with your friends or other people to see who can get through the levels first? The winner get's cool weapons/items, adds a new aspect to the game).

Hope you guys enjoy the review and grab this game!

Here is some gameplay that shows the game in all its glory!

27,Gunfire Reborn,69716428,english,"This game is an absolute blast! Gun-play and movement is generally fast-paced and feels very good, though there are some situations which make you feel pretty slow. The amount of varying synergies between all the items and abilities in the game is incredible. Most weapons feel good to use; I think there's only one weapon I currently dislike and more than a handful that I adore.

The maps get old really quick, especially since you go through them in the same order with generally little variation in everything but drops. I believe the roguelite nature of the game would be slightly more enjoyable if a certain ability that allows you to store your talent points was unlocked or available from the start. The two current heroes don't seem equally balanced, as one doles out way more damage at the cost of semi-useful crowd-controlling abilities. However, it does require a bit of progression to unlock the second hero, so perhaps there will be ""side-grade"" heroes in the future.

Overall, I'm inclined to say that the current state the game is in seems worth the current price of admission. Core gameplay is repetitive as expected, but the already large amount of variation in scrolls and weapons combined with the slick controls makes it enjoyable to replay. With more maps, tile variation, heroes, and perhaps game modes, I can see this being a pretty solid FPS roguelite similar to Dead Cells.",1590313915,1590314066,TRUE,1,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,587,2,700,0,440,1597962965,,

53,Gunfire Reborn,69663995,english," it's the first time i see a roguelike/fps game like this one and its not bad at all, it is a Great if i say so my self, the game has  good mechanics and awesome gameplay but also this game is not going to give you countless of hours of entertainment, yet, the game is still in early access so dont expect much more, but it still going to give you good amount of time for you to learn the game and enjoy it to the last bit.
as i said the game still in development so it lacks some features, but if it is weapons you seek you will find a good variety of them, enough to make the game look fresh everytime you start a run.
Two of few issues i encountered was a tiny little bit of delay between you and the player you're playing with, the hitboxes on you're character and the dash when you're fighting a boss (at least the 1st).
I sincerely recommend you to play this game with friends but if you don't have any and dont want to be all by your self you still have match making, yes this little game has matchmaking but only if you're level 10 thats the shittiest part.
if you're doubting buying this game just try it out you have nothing to lose if you dont like it you can always refound, i strongly recommend anyone that likes roguelike games to try it out.",1590238750,1590238750,TRUE,1,0,0,1,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,284,4,1046,0,102,1595283517,,

55,Gunfire Reborn,69659181,english,"Good but missing important stuff
1- i don't know that I've been hit: put an effect when player receive damage ( blood at screen borders and light screen shake)
2- i don't know when the room is going to finish: put a meter bar to show how many enemies left
3- some enemies feel lifeless and dull 
4- soundtrack - getting into battle or leaving it's the same change that and put some Ancient Chinese battle music
5- the map feels like unfinished painting - put some color on stuff ( when i was playing some rooms were all blue and feel boring to look at)
6- get rid of that black line around the guns or reduce it's size
7- when getting a scroll try and make it more clear to what i got.

Also instead of a menu  make the player walk around the bar thing or hub to access armory or logbook and match making

we don't have many games like these so i'm happy that i found it and it looks promising  
and i suggest the devs to play immortal redneck and ziggurat and take notes from there",1590232331,1590232774,TRUE,1,1,0.479196548,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,251,93,25,0,17,1590389111,,
56,Gunfire Reborn,69655336,english,"What a pleasant surprise! 

This is a great little game that feels well-polished, especially for being in early access. There are about 30 weapons which you can unlock by doing a variety of small challenges. On top of that, this game has a great progression system which you can slowly work on unlocking to grant you passive perks. Apparently, there is four-player co-op which I have not yet tried, and another character that can be unlocked. 

I am very excited to see what the future holds in store for this game!

57,Gunfire Reborn,69650466,english,"Okay first off. Great game for 10.43$ I was looking for a fun game to play and stumbled across this one. Great so far. lemme list why
-Rogue like
-Multiple weapons/ randomized
-Feels pretty polished for early access game and I'm only 40 mins in.
-Controller support
- Stable frame rate which is rare for games in early access.
Buttt there are some cons.
-Enemies feel repetitive
-Rooms feel same, Almost all have same linear layout
- Only 2 heros.
-Not that many guns
So I'd rate this a 6.5-7 out of 10 which is good but there is room for improvement which is promising because again this game is in early access.",1590219284,1590219352,TRUE,3,0,0.497942358,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,129,3,708,0,41,1598755744,,

honestly though it's pretty fun so far! a variety of guns and skill upgrades to make combos with as you progress, and if you win/lose, you earn currency to upgrade your base stats. typical roguelike!

guns are varied and feel weighty, the art direction is super pretty to look at, and there's a dang PANDA WITH A BEARD running the bar
