1,Mafia Definitive Edition,77059339,english,"Never played the original so I decided to check this remaster out. I just completed the campaign on the medium difficulty in just under 11 hours. I thoroughly enjoyed it. Some minor visual and enemy AI bugs here and there, but nothing game breaking. 

The game is designed in a way that you go from one story mission straight into the next, unlike GTA where you can progress at your own pace. As a newcomer to the series, I felt the story was well written, albeit a little predictable for a mob/mafia story. I will say that I felt the story, voice acting and music score felt very high production. None of the story missions felt repetitive, each one had a different approach and never felt that I went through the same locales twice. 

I will say the combat/shooting mechanics fell a little clunky at times. I played on mouse and keyboard, and I was never able to get a solid feeling on my mouse sensitivity so my aiming was inconsistent at times. It did feel great mowing people down with a shotgun though.

The graphics are great, I was able to run with near-max settings on my 2060 and kept a consistent frame rate the entire time. You can roam the city freely under the 'free drive' option, but I never felt enticed to check it out aside from the main reason being to admire the city and the graphics.

Overall, I would recommend it at full price if you were already a fan of the series or if you're looking for an enjoyable third person shooter with a great campaign story. Definitely a no-brainer if it goes on sale. As mentioned at the start, I was able to beat the campaign just short of 11 hours and you can make much more out of it if you're into the collectibles or want to beat it on Classic difficulty.",1601869123,1601869433,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,181,3,663,663,663,1601865798

7,Mafia Definitive Edition,77057788,english,"So, I've gotta say this is worth it, but it;s not at the same time.  
The story is good, the cut scenes are super high quality.  Minimal bugs, smooth, good looking game play all around.  
My biggest issue with this game is that the story is super short.  It ends all too abruptly.  yes, you do get to see how the main characters life spans out, but it just doesn't have the playtime I was hoping for.  
After completing the story, there's NOTHING ELSE TO DO.  Yeah, sure, you could mess around in free roam and collect all the achievements, but it's honestly boring.  

My only suggestion to anyone on the development team that may see this....
Add missions or something in the free roam.  Not another whole story, but something to do.  Run rackets, collect items, anything.  Some sort of side missions, anything that will actually give me a reason to recommend this to a friend.  Maybe a actual currency system, options to buy and upgrade cars, options for more guns and/or cosmetic up grades for them.  I NEED MORE TO DO!

What I hope to see in the future for this game...
I'm hoping the devs keep up on this, and add more to the story.  I'd love to see some of Sam and Paulie's lives from their perspective.  Maybe some of the Don's POV.  That would be super cool.  Maybe more cars and guns, but ones relative to the era of course!  And all that, without having to empty my pockets!

All and all though, as of right now, unless you're a die hard mafia fan like me, don't buy the game yet.  Wait for more to be added or for the price to drop.

I do like what they done with the story what they added helped make the game feel more complete i will add if you loved the driving in the original game and the amount of it hen you will be disappointed as loads of it was taken up by cutscenes so it does make the game much shorter than the original, my problems with the game are as follows the 60hz bug there is a easy fix out there but it is the same bug that was in mafia 3 so i would've hoped it to have been fixed this time around and the random freezing and crashing which i would hope they will have a fix for when they release and update. 

All in all the game  is well done there are issues with it as i have stated but if i was to look at the car as it is i can't say that i would recommend the game unless you are used to dealing with game bugs and did play and enjoy the original game as it does feel very in the spirit of the original. i personally would wait for the game to get an update before purchasing the game but once they have the crashing issues solved i would say this is very well done retake on a  personally favourite game of mine.",1601841206,1601841408,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,209,2,839,839,788,1601844938

67,Mafia Definitive Edition,77038178,english,"Before i start my review i need to say that mafia 1 classic was best game in my whole life and i finished it more than any of other games i experienced .

also as a remake this game is one of the best remakes i have ever seen in 8th generation , when i say best remake means most loyal remake to the classic game. remakes started from 8th generation , some remakes were good some bad , we had awful remakes and great remakes but still some of the best remakes weren't that much loyal to it's own classic game neither. this is loyal , every 20 missions in the original game rebuild step by step , of course there are bunch of redesigns in the game but not any cent changed or cut from original game . 

as i saw all of the redesigns compare to classic game are in a positive way , there are some redesigned in stories which nothing cut but change it's way and there are some redesigned in gameplay. 

story redesigns are perfect , there are so many extra detail on remake story which those were ambiguous in original but i don't mention them because of spoils. 

gameplay redesigns are perfect either , so many mission have redesigned which all of them were in positive way of course because of modern technology potential . stealth mechanics added , way much more details to the city and missions added and so many changes which they are very compatible for 2020 and all of them were in good purpose.

finally as a fan the classic game was best game in my life and this remake is best remake i have experienced for now , as a technical reviewer i say the game contains all of the original game pros and it's a masterpiece in 2020 just like the original game was in 2002 but only cons i find are just about some bugs which they are still related to mafia III engine . so original fans are still very happy and excited but i suggest new players to avoid spoilers and buy this game , because i guarantee that this game will be a different and fresh experience for them.

69,Mafia Definitive Edition,76614864,english,"The game is not bad, but it could've been better.
Warning! this review will contain small spoilers.

The thing that bothers me the most is that missions feel very scripted. You have no freedom at all, you have to do exactly the steps that the developers imagined when doing level design.

Take for example the ""Visiting rich people"" mission: in the original game you could take the brute-force approach and kill everyone, or the stealth approach and finish the mission without even being noticed, or something in between. In the Definitive Edition there's basically only one way to do it (spoiler: you always get caught). The entire game is like this, very ""hand holding"". Because of this, you can really notice trigger points, e.g. when enemies are spawned.

They also made the game very fast paced. For example the ""Omerta"" mission in the original game took quite a long time. Go to Biff, then go to Little Tony, then go to Joe, then go look for Frank, follow him to the airport, do the stuff at the airport, then drive back to the city to get the account books from the bank, then drive back to Salieri's. It really felt like a busy day for Tommy. In Definitive Edition the mission is like: go to Biff, then go to Tony (who is now located nearby, so you don't have to drive too much), then go look for Frank, follow him to the airport, do the stuff, and basically the mission is over. You don't even have to escape from the airport! Also, what needed to be done on the airport is much more complicated in the original (find Frank's family, find the plane tickets...) and with more freedom than in the remake (multiple approaches to kill the police, a way to escape from the airport without police...). Sure, there are some improvements here and there, but they don't make up for the actually missing content.

The ""A trip to the country"" mission is absolutely horribly done, especially the escaping part. Very Hollywoodian, with explosions and whatnot.

""You lucky bastard"" is stripped/dumbed down as well. In the original game it really felt like Morello is lucky, with many assassination attempts failing. Similarly to ""Omerta"", you don't have to escape from the harbor after finishing the mission.

""Moonlighting"" is stripped down as well, very fast paced - the mission starts directly at the bank!

""Just for relaxation"" has a different twist compared to the original. Not sure why they made that change, because it doesn't really make sense.

Another bad thing is that missions from Lucas Bertone are gone. Basically that character is only relevant for the Fairplay mission. Even the interaction with Ralph and Vincenzo is quite odd and meaningless, you can basically live without them. Also, Vincenzo has a Russian accent, so... there's that.

They also removed some cool features from the original game: using public transport, bridges lifting to allow ships to pass underneath, being stopped by the police for traffic offences (traffic lights are basically non-existent in this game... there are a few, but small and not noticeable), car lockpicking was done better in the original and BRILLIANTLY in Mafia 2 - now you can basically steal any car, any time. I also think it's stupid they added the police radio, without at least being able to disable it!

Car physics/mechanics was in my opinion better in the original, and so were the car sounds and the damage system. There are also very few car models, and all of them feel and sound pretty much the same. Similarly, weapon animations and sounds are terrible (the reloads are very fast, Molotov cocktails are thrown like tissues...). Picking up ammo/weapons was also done better in the original. Combat system was much better in Mafia 2, and even in Mafia 1, considering that Tom was a pretty soft guy. Also, in the original game, some missions (Omerta, You lucky bastard) could be approached by getting in a car and driving over the enemies - not possible here.

The city is not very memorable, when playing you feel like in a movie, you are not really ""living"" there. In the original you could really learn the city layout and drive without needing the map. Part of it may be caused by the ""GPS"" routing, which was missing in the original and you are unable to disable it in Definitive Edition.

I also dislike the voice acting and the characters personalities. I think Sam is the only main character they got right. Frank is ok as well. However, Tom is way too aggressive, Paulie is goofy, Salieri seems too young and violent (while at the same time condemning Morello's violence...).

The best part is that the story is pretty much the original one. They changed the moral of the story (the epilogue monologue), and I personally think that the original one was better, but oh well, I can live with it.

Another downside is that Freeride mode is pretty dumb: there's basically nothing to do. No ""Taxi"" missions, no gangsters driving around, no buying weapons and fixing cars, no racing mode (which was initially planned for the original game)...

All in all, the game is decent, but I really think it would've been better if they just took the original and implemented it in the new engine, without changing anything major (they removed a lot of content, instead of adding...). There are some good changes, but they come at the expense of quite a lot of bad changes. I'm curious what the modders will manage to fix/improve.

Would I recommend it? Well, between the original and this one, I would recommend the original with some mods. This one is not worth $40, because the best part of it is the story, which is basically the same as in the original (thankfully!)",1601147666,1601833231,FALSE,7,0,0.545998514,1,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,22,1,1746,1746,1746,1601824707

The musical choices were spot on, a few nods to the score of old without it being in your face. But That's where the praise ends unfortunately. As someone that played and loved the original, I can't recommend this. 

The biggest issue I had was how much this game holds your hand and forces you to do scripted events that could've easily been cut out of the game and wouldn't have changed a thing. 

 * The missions are over way too quick compared to the 2002 version. 
 * No more do we have the choice to visit Luca Bertone after a mission and work to 
   unlock a rare and interesting vehicle, now you just find them.
 * There is constantly a hovering diamond objective point that shows you where to go, again 
   another thing that wasn't needed.
 * The guns and combat felt dumbed down, clunky and unpolished/unfinished?
 * Checkpoints that would have you in a continual dying loop
 * Driving mechanics were too sensitive and weren't much of a challenge to drive at speeds 
 

The reason I bought this was because during the hype, they kept saying that they were going to stay true to the classic, and that they had team members from the original on board to make sure this happened. I don't know what they were doing when this was made because it sure isn't staying true to the classic.

- They added a few vehicles and motorbikes which feel great
- Gunplay is improved overall
- Graphics and Animations are amazing
- Classic features like the traffic laws and stuff are still in place

Negatives:
- Automatic cover system
- No skill involved in throwing throwables
- The music is dumbed down
- Original voices are swapped out
- Onscreen waypoints and lines on the map that can't be turned off
- They tried to make it more spectacular by adding immersion breaking cutscene segments

99,Mafia Definitive Edition,77026810,english,"Mafia ist ein echt gutes Remake.
Dennoch sollte man vorher wissen worauf man sich einstellen muss. Denn das Spiel wirkt auf den 1 Blick wie ein Open World Spiel , aber das ist es auf keinenfall.

Mafia ist extrem Linear. Man wird durch die Story gepuscht und hat zwischendurch keine Interaktionen mit der Open World. Diese spielt wirklich nur eine Kulisse im Hintergrund der wirklich guten Story. Man fährt also nicht von Auftrag zu Auftrag , sondern erlebt die einzelnen Kapitel für Kapitel nacheinander die nur durch Zwischen Sequenzen getrennt werden. Wenn man also ein Open World Spiel erwartet wie GTA dann sollte man auf jedenfall zweimal darüber nachdenken Mafia sich zu holen.

Sonst haben die Devs gute Arbeit geleistet. Ja das Mafia 1 Original ist viel besser , aber nicht jeder konnte vor über 15 Jahren dieses spielen. Durch das Remake kann nun jeder in die tolle Welt von Mafia und deren Charaktere eintauchen. Die Story ist sehr fesselnd und die einzelnen Missionen sehr unterhaltsam. 

Dennoch wirkt das Spiel 10-15 Jahre alt. Es hat zwar eine neue Optik und neue Gameplay Features , aber die wirken alle sehr veraltet. Das Remake hilft schon besser reinzukommen aber dennoch errinert mich Mafia von der Gameplay Seite her stark an LA Noire. Man hat sehr viele Einschränkungen und das Spiel erwartet von einem dass man einfach die Story durchhämmert. Persönliche Freiheit ist 100% nicht dabei.

+ Tolle Story , Tolle Charaktere
+ Wunderschöner Soundtrack
+ Spielzeit bei 8 Stunden + 

- Open World nur Fake sozusagen.
- Keine Persönliche Freiheit
- Combat System ausreichend aber wirkt stark veraltet 
- KI ist meiner Meinung nach das schlimmste am Mafia Remake. Passanten und Gegner KI ist underirdisch schlecht. DIe fühlen sich stark nach Bug an. 

Fazit : 8 von 10
Mafia ist auf jedenfall ein Tolles Story Spiel. Nicht mehr und nicht weniger. Die Devs haben gute Arbeit geleistet und bieten es sogar noch für 39,99€ an. Was will man mehr.

Unfortunately the developers don't seem to care about community feedback and bring old issues and problems into the definitive editions. For example, the AI is still really bad, mostly about traffic. In comparison to GTA, AI against AI works pretty well in traffic, but the player seems to be some sort of exception. They just honk at you almost everytime, no matter what you do. If the traffic lights are turning from red to green, they will honk at you immedtiately, without giving you time to even move foward. They also don't care about traffic rules, but just by the player. You drive streight and suddenly, AI who's coming from left and right will honk at you. Thats just stupid and really annoying. I remember this problem in Mafia III too. So the developers don't care to change any of this. And thats sad, because a lot of the time you will spend driving around from A to B.

[*]When shooting out of car, there is an autoaim of sorts without any ability to turn it off. Keep it in for people who wants to use it, but let us turn it off, please.
[*] [really small nitpick] Let us restart the chapter straight from any of the menus. Currently to do it, you need to fail the mission or die. So there were situations when i missed something in the opening cutscene and to restart it I had to spent some time to get cops on me to kill me, so that i could see it again, because the normal checkpoint was after the cutscene was over.

I was already a big fan of Mafia 2, despite never having played the first one
due to being a lazy bum, however, this game gave me everything I craved from Mafia 2 
that was never delivered. I now see why everyone thought Mafia 2 was a disappointment.

You simply cannot beat a masterpiece of a game like this in terms of storytelling.

Let me begin by saying that the voice acting and facial animations are simply phenomenal in this game, something I hadn't seen since L.A. Noire, only done better. You know when the characters are nervous, scared, angry or happy just by looking at their faces.
The Gameplay consists mostly of just driving and shooting, however this is done so well, because the driving feels ultra-realistic and I felt completely obligated to drive like I was really there. The shooting parts are just cover shooting, but guns were so well in this game, it makes you feel like you are in a real gunfight, the aim shakes around a lot while you walk making it hard to shoot anyone while moving, so you can't just go rambo and expect to kill everyone, you gotta play smart, because the AI isn't completely braindead, they will try to flank you and if you play like a pussy, they'll get you out of your cover one way or another.
 
I RECOMMEND HEADPHONES AND PLAYING ON HARD.

The side characters you play and drive along with, THESE ARE YOUR FRIENDS.
You feel like they're your friends, the game is so long that you feel emotionally connected with them and you get a sense of respect and empathy for them, because of how much you go through together.

The atmosphere is excellent, with a lot of times where you feel like ""oh shit, what's going on"" and suddenly you can feel your character breathing heavily and feeling nervous, in turn making the player nervous.

The story telling is on par with the TV show ""The Sopranos"" but imagine all 6 seasons cut short to fit a 12 hour story, that is if you don't run around and do other stuff, which to be fair, isn't a whole lot, however the city is ginormous and I haven't gotten to exploring all of it yet.
Everything made sense and you almost never go ""wait why the hell did that happen?"" Except the one guy with the native Italian who couldn't speak English. I don't speak any Italian at all myself, but I understood mostly what he was implying, despite Tommy going ""uh yeah okay sure whatever you say"" when he's actually Italian himself.",1601813399,1601813399,TRUE,1,0,0.523809552,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,59,4,860,860,842,1601814691

Hated the Circle crosshair for the pistols, it was very annoying. Crosshair and lack of good effects and sound is my complains on combat, may be they will patch it.
Graphics - for the most part the game looks awesome. The overall lighting and reflections are very good. Some areas has this issue of lowres textures, like you can see it clearly.
With all said and done I wanted much more from the world, instead of it being very linear. I know the original was linear, but this one was the remake from ground up.  They could have done much more with the world could have added various activities, more racing scenarios, could have added in more gameplay mechanics  Salieris take over by introducing areas of control, defending an area, Total Income of your hood etc , instead of one or two linear ones.

3. Public transport is unable to be used off to the player... [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6wuIBWforI]even when you can actually GET to it![/url] [spoiler]this might be due to sloppy building placement and unfinished train track more than anything else[/spoiler]

4. The traffic AI is OVERLY perceptive and stops for you to turn... but then beeps at you?

22,Mafia Definitive Edition,77016354,english,"As a long time fan of the original Mafia I cannot recommend this game. It feels like an easy cash grab by releasing a game that would generate a lot of sales by nostalgia alone.

Even though my playtime in Mafia:DE has been fairly short (45 minutes) it has been sufficient for me to be turned off it.

While the graphics are great, the rest of the game leaves wanting. To sum up what has turned me off so shortly after starting up the game:

-Tommy is significantly less sympathetic and feels like he is just snarky. Too much effort is going into trying to make him a bad ass, whether it is actively talking back against two unknown mobsters that just hopped into your car while in a gunfight, single handidly wanting to destroy the car-park of a mafia Don without any sort of hesitation or anxiousness, or just clearing a jump over a bridge in the first mission where the other mobsters are quite suprised by this, but Tommy being completely unfased.

-This game weighs heavily into game mechanics that are trendy now, such as jumping and vaulting mechanics all over the place (but ofc. only vaulting where there is a nice little sheet neatly spread over the wall where you are able to).

-Tommy is no longer a taxi driver that happened to turn mobster. He is now also an olympic trackstar that can run and jump over all sorts of stuff, but also apparently a trained unarmed martial artist, that can sneak up one someone and take someone down with his bare hands.

-Animations are quite off. When throwing molotovs or quickly scaling boxes, the animations are choppy and feel very rushed.

-Within the 1st mission when trying to escape there are various 'short cuts' you can take to get rid of your pursuiters. These are nothing more than cutscenes that activate on location. Furthermore, are they all the same: road works, that force tommy to slalom around some workmaterial, doing this successfully, but the pursuiter failing and smashing into the road works.

76,Mafia Definitive Edition,76998022,english,"I hardly review any games, but when I do, it's my childhood memory games.

This review, as many others is going to be more subjective than objective, because I love(d) Mafia game in the original version and was really awaiting release of this remake. 
I have finished original Mafia 5 times, the very first cheating with a save file after the race as it was too hard for me back then. Rest of play-throughs I managed to win the race fair and square. Some of my best memories were left in that game, so anticipation and expectations were high. 

Unfortunately, this is ONLY good/decent remake for me. As much as it brought some memories and nostalgic moments, it was only on the very basic levels. This is mainly due to:

- developers in some insane idea decided to change drastically all of the members of Salieri family, both in their design and voice. While I understand there was not a chance of the same voice actors to participate, they could've tried and resource some with the very similar voices, not to mentioned looks which would've been much easier.
- to go along with the voices, Hangar 13 went on a rampage of rooting Salieri family deeply into Italian roots. If anyone remembers from the original, while Salieri members might've had Italian roots/descendants, they were more Amercian feel, Tommy Angelo was blue eyed, red blooded Amercian, not pure Italian dark eyed guy who sounds like he already been in a mafia for half of his life. This really takes away from my experience, but I do understand general idea behind it, just didn't work for me.

Those are two biggest issues, the same family that I remembered is no longer resembling anything from back then, except the names.

Other than that, there are some minor changes to the missions and game play is adjusted to modern ""standards"" but there are 2 more things that bothered me. 

- Melee combat is now almost non existent, only in form of QTE which ruins the fun and difficulty of original combat. 
- Someone had a ""brilliant"" idea of putting A CIRCLE as a target/crossair on pistols...this is really infuriating trying to make head shots as having someone's head in the circle doesn't means it will be head shot like it would on normal crossair or just simple dot. 

I can't say anything wrong about aesthetics/looks/graphics of the game as they are really good, just like you'd expect it in 2020, but it's not just the graphics that count. 

Overall, while playing it was still fun (a bit simpler, but still fun) experience, it only brushed around my nostalgia for the original game, mostly again at the end, but other than that it was only decently done remake. 

As a whole, I would ideally put a ""horizontal"" thumb as my feeling are mixed, but knowing that it is only me, and any other person touching Mafia for the first time, I think I'd recommend it, it has few flaws, but not enough to ruin the fun for a new members of the family.

The short and sweet is that I think this game is worth it for the story and time period. I played Mafia 2 awhile back and I will be comparing the two in some regards. Now for my pros and cons.

Pros:
-Time period, few games are set in the interwar period. Mafia does a great job of bringing to life the 30's era.
-Vehicles, the feel of the cars is heavy just like in real life. They added a motorcycle which is a blast to ride. There is some vehicle customization such as paint jobs.
- Graphics are beautiful
-Story is great but I have only played the definitive so I don't know what changes were made.
-Gunplay, for me this is very satisfying

Cons:
- Not much to do in the world other than drive around and shoot. Mafia 2 you can buy food, drinks, gas, guns, and clothes. Mafia 2 you can customize your vehicles more in the garage. Mafia unfortunately doesn't have previous said things.
- Guns, there are only a few guns. They offer multiple hand guns, a shotgun, a rifle, and one submachine gun. I felt like the BAR should have been in this game and maybe a MP18 to add variety.

Overall it's a game that should be experienced. The time period and free ride are fun was to burn time.",1601771600,1601771600,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,117,3,777,777,730,1601774538

3,Mafia Definitive Edition,76988868,english,"Pros and cons at the bottom.

This is a difficult one for me, because I am a huge fan of the original, and have been ever since it came out. My PC back then was barely able to run it at all, but I loved every minute of it anyway.

I'm a huge car fan, and especially vintage cars, in games. The original Mafia had a big emphasis on the cars, with Ralphie introducing each new car by talking a bit about the engine and any particular quirks they had, as well as the numerous Lucas Bertone side missions that gave you cars that were better (faster at least) than the ""standard"" cars you got for free. It was a slow, steady, excellent progression from the lowly T-Ford, to the Cadillac V16 Fleetwood, and beyond. 

I do not think the guys at Hangar 13 are car guys. If they are, they are not showing it. They removed all the Lucas side missions (all you get are 5 hidden cars to be unlocked AFTER the story is complete). They also removed almost all the free ride extreme cars, except a few. I loved driving around in the Black Metal car, mowing down other cars and feeling invincible. I also adored the wheelie loving Crazy Horse car, which was totally uncontrollable, but still damn fun.

You barely interact with Ralphie at all in the remake. A few times, especially in the beginning, and then he is basically gone from the story. And you only meet Lucas once, in the race mission. 

Another annoying thing is that when you enter a car, it only displays the brand name of the car, not the actual model name. Stupid oversight. Car handling is also easier than in the original. The race mission is a joke now compared to what it was before. You can basically keep the gas pinned all the time in the race car - in the original you had to use a bit of finesse, or risk sliding out and losing the race. But I suspect most people are happy about that, seeing how hated the race mission was in the original (seems some people still dislike it in the remake, for some reason).

I DO love the fact that they added motorcycles, being an avid motorcycle rider in real life. They control pretty good too. 

I don't feel it like it was worth full price for me. I'd prefer to give this a neutral rating, if that was possible. For new players, it might very well be different. But for me, the original still reigns supreme. As remakes go, this is really quite good though. 

Pros and cons:
- The original Mafia car magic is gone
- The excellent atmosphere from the original is mostly gone
- No steering wheel support (original had excellent steering wheel support with FFB and clutch axis)
- Free Ride Extreme is gone (a few elements of it can be found in the Free Ride mode)
- Some missions play worse than in the original
- Shooting sequences are a bit lengthy sometimes

+ Even though simplified a bit, the driving physics are still very good
+ Shooting mechanics are pretty good, in my opinion
+ Faithful recreation of the city from the original
+ Characters are much more fleshed out than in the original
+ Most missions are improved a little or quite a bit, overall
+ Graphics and sounds are good; music has been expanded upon a lot
+ Optimization seems decent (60ish fps avg on a 5120x1440 monitor on max settings, with a 2080 Ti and an i9 10900K - around 120 in regular 1440p resolution)

After a few years of not thinking about the Mafia series, I wanted to pick up the games again. For the first time ever I would play the original Mafia game. 

I launched Mafia from 2002, played for a few hours and decided that it was too dated for me. But just when I decided to postpone the series for a while, I received the news that this definitive edition would be released. Never have I ever pre-ordered a game this quick.

After a few months of patiently waiting the definitive edition was released. My second attempt to play the Mafia series had begun. The first thing that I noticed was how good the graphics are. But that is just a fraction of what the game has to offer. What Mafia: Definitive Edition has to offer is more than just good graphics and gameplay, this game has a story that puts most modern games to shame.

The story and dialogue made me fall in love with this game, I felt the same feeling when I finished Mafia 2 back in the day, The same feeling why I, after more than a decade, remember the Mafia series. I finished most of the game in one day and am now continuing my journey to the second game.

36,Mafia Definitive Edition,76982158,english,"I wanted to give this game some time before I wrote my full review. PC gamers have a huge reputation for being picky, and I don't like or want to be part of that problem. That being said, PC gaming is about choice. When developers respect our options for choice, I'm happy. When they don't, I'm less happy. With a remake or remaster, my standards are generally a lot higher than a regular game. This might sound opposite of what you'd expect, given that they are working with an old game. That being said, when that old game is $10 and the new one is $40 or $50 or $60, the bar goes up for me. Because I'm asking if its ""$30 better"" than the original. With Mafia Definitive, I can assure you it is $30 better than the original release. There are some issues here, Unfortunately it has some invasive DRM. There is a lot of good though too, including high refresh rates, ultrawide support (gameplay not cutscenes which is fine) and more. The new graphics and engine are gorgeous, and the game runs very well on my laptop and desktop alike. I've played part of this game on my Television through my laptop with HDMI and an xbox controller, and the rest on my desktop PC with a keyboard and mouse and an ultrawide. The game runs great in these senses. My biggest complaint is that it doesn't work with Proton. I understand that developers don't want to spend money on linux support, but valve has made it extremely easy (and practically free) to simply ensure your game works with proton. I believe the invasive DRM is to blame here. Hopefully this can be addressed in the future. I was a huge fan of Mafia 2, and never got the chance to play the original due to it failing to run oon my modern hardware. This modern reimagining has given me the chance I lost to go back in time and experience this gem. Some might complain that the gameplay is linear despite the open world, or that there are few extra activities when compared to other AAA contemporaries such as GTA, but I see a world that was crafted to tell a story. The story is well delivered, and really makes me feel the good and bad of being a gangster in the 30s. There are regrets, excitement, highs, and lows. The story really gets empathy out of me when touching on subjects such as love, brotherhood, empathy,  fear, and betrayal. If you like action games in big worlds, and want to immerse yourself in the 1930s world of a gangster, this game is for you. -PR0XIDIAN",1601749101,1601749101,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,1882,202,582,582,330,1601777319

If you want an interactive movie with gansters this can take that place easily. But the rest of it, the game part regarding the world, physics, AI and all its mechanics seem very dated and bland. I found it boring and annoying. Besides the part that the original had a free roam mode, i really don't see a point to have it in either.
As the newest addition to the family, it really should had been the king of the ball. But frankly it doesn't rise up to the levels of the second and third installments of the series. So for an oldy kind of feeling game with mobsters Mafia 2 is still the better. And regarding the music, radio and enjoyment to just free roam, Mafia 3 is in the lead still.
So if you're not sure, don't bother. If you really want to complete your collection i guess it might seem that is not so much of a loss either. You decide. If i would be able to buy it after playing it i wouldn't as i don't really feel it's a keeper.

Main story is actually the same as in the game from 2002. To be honest after all these years I remembered all missions, they were so good and memorable. It shame some mentioned details are missing (e.g. Lucas missions, where you were able to get very good cars and they gave you advantage during missions). Shooting from cars, vehicles' destroying system are downgraded in remake. Also Free ride is rather boring in comparision to two ""free rides"" in orginal game. 

Pros :
+ new graphic 
+ the same good plot and memorable missions (with little changes)
+ game was adapted for present days
+ It is the good game from 2002

Cons:
- missing Lucas' missions
- missing importance of possesion really good car
- changed looks of Paulie and Sam (Why Sam doesnit have bowtie and ""blue"" suit during all game?)

This remake exceeded my expectations, what they did with the game's characters is their vision of their movements is stunningly beautiful and realistic, and how the vision of the city was recreated makes her even more beautiful and the atmosphere so that it makes you feel like you're living in your 30s. The story and missions are exactly the same as in the original game which makes me very happy, most of the missions have even been extended the places they added to the map outside the city going to the countryside so that the player could visit them are very nice, The gameplay mechanics of the game are great and very comfortable and smooth unlike the original game, the original gameplay and was super uncomfortable however, I closed my eyes to these things because the game was cruel and cool. The graphics of the game I do not want to comment on it is more than beautiful even surpasses the graphics of the Mafia III. This is one of the best Mafia games that will forever be in the first place in my heart, one of the golden games that people will always love and prefer. There are only 2 reasons that disappointed me a bit and they are


 Reason number 1: that the game is not optimized and from time to time there are performance issues, it is full of many bugs and glitches, most of the time the game stutters and crashes in one place and does not move, which kills the desire to play

Reason number 2: that they removed the option to use public transport, as Tram and Metro in the original game these things were available and you could use public transport. And the fact that the side missions of Lucas Bertone that we all remember from the original game have been removed and instead some pictures have been added to the wall in his service from which the player must find the place where there is a hidden car to unlock. The racing mission that we also all know from the original game. In the remake, the option to choose the level of difficulty of the mission itself has been removed, and when the player plays the game on a higher level of difficulty and when you get to this mission, it is set to be difficult, while in the original game you were not required to play high. difficulty and there was a mission option to choose the level of difficulty, I don't like that and it's a bit cheeky on the part of the studio to force things on us that most people may not like.


otherwise everything else is more than great in the game, I will be happy if the studio makes some future downloadable content for this game, such as additional missions and additional side story, as Mafia II and Mafia III and so the game will become even more great.

First things first.. Mafia The City of Lost Heaven is my favorite game and for me its best game of all time. That was our national treasure and unfortunately original Mafia wasn’t that popular because of Grand Theft Auto III release. Sad.

So after 18 long years we have here a remake of our lovely original Mafia. Well story is definitely better in new one, just because cutscenes are top quality, but there are some things that ruined my immersion. What about performance  vs visuals? It’s just average.. details, fps drops or slow texture loading? That's real thing and it have to be patched! Otherwise  
game look above average. 

Stupid AI, stupid (not only) car physics, bugs, freezes, bugged sound after ALT+TAB, HORRIBLE crosshair, clunky character movement (if character reacting on environment) or long loading after death or if you want to go back to checkpoint. 

But I don’t want to (only) trashtalk, story is almost “same”. Big thanks goes to cutscenes, they are at super high quality, dubbing is also super high quality (played with Czech dubbing, I missed some good quotes, but actors performance leveled up (btw. in the DE were same actors from original game)). Unfortunately missing quotes are big deal, because sometimes story just doesn't make sense, but you know what will be next because you played original game - so newcomers watch out. 

Overall I don’t think I just wasted 40€, I enjoyed (almost) every hour in the game and I’ll play it again with English dubbing. For people new to Mafia, it's a very good introduction into the series, better than 2002 Mafia, especially if you don’t like playing old games. For “old school” players it’s still a very decent remembrance, I’m sure you will enjoy this remake as I did even if trams, free roam activities or elevated railroad missing. 

btw. If you want the best possible ending, switch difficulty for the last mission (The Death of Art) on hard (or lower), if you play on Classic (hardest one) you will get ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Ice Cube remix at the end. Unfortunately you will not get achievement on Steam for completing a game on classic difficulty.

Prvně bych rád řekl, že Mafia The City of Lost heaven je mou nejoblíbenější hrou a asi i nejlepší hrou kterou jsem kdy hrál. Byl to náš národní poklad, bohužel originál vycházel ve stejné době jako Grand Theft Auto III.

Takže po 18 dlouhých letech tu máme remake naší milované Mafie a je to slušný! Příběh je rozhodně lepší hlavně díky novým in game cinematicůmm které jsou hodně kvalitní, ale bohužel jsem se nedokázal ponořit do hry. Hra neběží nejlépe, ale ani nehůře, vypadá nadprůměrně dobře ale stále tu najdete věci jako.. fps dropy a pomalé načítání textur? No to není ani zdaleka vše, fyzika (hlavně aut), hloupá umělá inteligence, chyby, zasekávání hry, dost často zabugovaný zvuk po ALT+TAB, neohrabaný charakter (hlavně když reaguje na prostředí kolem sebe), dlouhé načítací časy po smrti a příšerný crosshair!

Nechci mluvit jen špatně, příběh je pořád téměř stejný, ale vylepšený o nové filmečky v nejvyšší možné kvalitě, stejně tak dabing je výborný a i lepší než v původní hře. Pro nové hráče je Definitivní edice výborným vstupem do série, pro starší hráče je to pěkné připomenutí staré klasiky a za 40€ se to rozhodně vyplatí. I přestože chybí nějaké slavné hlášky, tramvaje a nebo nadzemka. 

Jinak pokud chcete co nejlepší možný konec, tak prosím u poslední mise (Smrt umění / The Death of Art) si změňte obtížnost z Klasické (nejtěžší) na jednodušší (těžké a menší). Jinak dostanete po finální cutsceně Ice Cube remix, který byl v traileru na Mafii III… Mno v 51 roce už asi frčel rap.

67,Mafia Definitive Edition,76973476,english,"From someone that played the original back in 2002 and thinks it is one of the best games of all time, I was really looking forward to this remake, and hoped they wouldn't do a Mafia 3 to it. there are pros and cons so read below.

The Game story is still the best story you will find in my opinion it's so engaging and they have still captured this in the remake and have elaborated on some of the story arcs. so it still feels like you're playing a movie not a game which is great for immersion. BUT and there is a but, they have changed some of the missions and not all for the better. car chases now have a need for speed style trigger event where you can loose a tail and you get a cinematic cutscene of driving through to loose them ( original you had to do it all yourself ) I like that you have these points but would be better if you had to do the driving through them, others are escaping in some of the missions are almost too easy in parts and in some cases completely different loosing the edge of your seat moments that you had in the original as you really tried to get away after doing a mission. that being said for the most part the missions are still really enjoyable and are really well done. they really give you a sense of being a made man. 

Graphically what can I say... I never thought I would see the city of Lost Heaven looking so beautiful! it is by far one of the nicest and lived in feel worlds you can get that's realistic feeling. remember to not speed or break the law or you will be punished. the level of detail on the buildings and cars even the character models look fantastic. the weather effects also look amazing especially at night with the lighting. they really have done a great job on the graphics. only real negative I have is the car damage could of been better as sometimes you can hit something at speed and the car looks fine.

Audio is really good on the guns sound brilliant and you get the impact feeling with the bullets, The cars sound throaty and have a really nice tone to them too. all of the sound in this game are really good, the music on the over hand is a little disappointing, if you listen to the original score it had some real impact to the music where as here they cut off the dynamic sound in some of the music which really doesn't fit or sell the scene as well, it is still good but not quite as good as the original, I would of liked them on the songs they kept to have that same impact. The radio is not bad but a little non nondescript but adequate although I like that when you go through the tunnels that the signal starts to get lost.

the gameplay I found was absolutely fine no real new standard setting but what you would expect in this kinda game, I had a few issues where the camera got me stuck on an object but it was very few and with a little jigging you got free. the gun recoil is so much better on this one to the original that is a massive plus as you get in a lot of gun fights. the original was a little too over the top. the cars handle beautifully and the movements are great overall the gameplay is great the only real issue I have with it was that the trams can't be used nor the trains which you could in the original and you used to use them in your escape also the race was so so.

Now anyone that played the original will know what I mean when I say the race was hard and most had to replay it a lot to win. This version it is still difficult as long as you have it on Classic difficulty (which is the only way you should play it) but it's difficult in a different way, the original was more all the cars were about the same speed and you just had to have perfect laps with no mistakes to win, this one the rubber banding on the cars behind is very apparent on the final straight but you really struggle to catch the ones in front. Also there was moments where it felt the game was really trying to make you have a mistake when you were in the lead, all of a sudden the car would struggle on a turn its done fine the same way before I had it where a simple tap to turn just sent it into the wall where I did the same other times and was fine. so its a mixed bag on the race as it is fun but there is a few bits that made it feel like the game was purposefully making it hard. which you didn't get before it just was hard. was still fun though.

I feel they could of done better with the free ride as I see little point in it and that most won't really use the free ride feature. 

Overall this Game is well worth a buy whether you're new to the series or you played the original. if you like Prohibition era, the Godfarther or just that Mafia style then you will really enjoy this, the cons are not enough to detract from a great game and Hanger 13 for the most part have done a decent job with this remake if not missed a few bits along the way. 8.5/10",1601738240,1601738240,TRUE,1,0,0.519999981,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,103,2,902,902,902,1601656549

78,Mafia Definitive Edition,76596797,english,"This is a poor remake and it was disingenuous of Hangar 13 to market it as a ""faithful remake"". Why? Consider the following:

* No public transport, can't ride train or tram, can't even enter platforms.
* Animations are ridiculously fast, to the point of looking comical. Mafia 1 was the opposite.
* No gun shops, no restaurants to eat for health, nothing to do or interact with in the world.
* Looks, feels and runs like Mafia 3.
* No interactive gas stations with clerk.
* Can't sit in car and turn off engine. Can't exit car with engine running. Can't turn on lights.
* No turn signals on any vehicles.
* Tommy shares many of the exact same soldier animations of Lincoln from Mafia 3.
* Dumb police behavior, crimes get ""magically"" reported even out in the country side.
* Driving missions are hand-held and heavily rely on prescripted cutscene action events.
* No buildings are enterable outside of missions.
* NPCs don't respond with dialogue, and if they do its with one word.
* Tommy has been rewritten to be a cocky d-bag, complete opposite manners to Mafia 1.
* Same horrid LOD issues on distant objects like buildings and vehicles like Mafia 3.
* Terrible AI.
* Graphics look similar to Mafia 2 with brightness turned up. ""Amazing graphics"" is fake news.
* Pop-in galore, to the point of cars and trains popping in right in front of you.
* Textures are generally low resolution even on maxed settings. Heavy dithering.
* Sounds are generally weaker in quality than Mafia 1. Lack of environmental audio.
* Atrociously poor lighting, the game will fade between odd shades of white, yellow and blue.
* Lucas Bertone missions missing from story mode.
* Fake pretense that tries to squeeze out the ""coolness"" of the characters to sound modern.
* In terms of city environment, you see the same buildings over and over again. Copy-paste.
* Countryside is dead without any npcs. Arcady magic burning barrels that serve no purpose.
* Cars missing from the original.
* No ability to play as taxi driver or kill gangsters in free ride. No gangsters driving around.
* Simulation driving mode is akin to a regular arcade driving mode, realistic physics are gone.
* No realistic suicide doors on cars like Mafia 1.
* No car tuning options like Mafia 2.
* Poor damage model on cars, smash into wall at full speed does nothing.
* The slow, methodical gameplay of Mafia 1 that increased difficulty and immersion is gone.
* Can't open bonnet to repair car like in Mafia 2.
* Lockpicking minigame dumbed down.
* Majority of music from the original is missing including all Mills Brothers and Belleville.
* Terrible gun play and cover system. Really, beyond parody.
* No world interactivity like turning on lights, faucets, flushing toilets etc.
* Intrusive toddler level waypoint markers telling you what to do and where to go at all times.
* Lack of bullet detail like entry holes on car tires.
* Bugs, glitches and generally poor quality control of the map. Several map seams found.
* Bridges don't rise dynamically in freeride like in Mafia 1, they are ""dead"".
* No dynamic day night cycle in freeride, it wasn't in Mafia 1, but standard for games today.
* No spoilers, but the game ends with a rap song. I'll let that one speak for itself.
* Can't disable basic in-game features like HUD, health bar or mini map. Is this actually 2020?
* No money system, can't buy anything.
* ""Tommy is not a trained soldier"" well that was a lie. 

That is a lot of negative sentiment one might say. But the amount of positive reviews not even touching on the disconnect between what Hangar 13 marketed this to be and what it actually delivers honestly makes me worried for where this industry is going and I can't help to wonder about the thought process and motives behind of all these flawless masterpiece 10/10 reviews.

7,Mafia Definitive Edition,76753820,english,"I've played the original Mafia many times to completion. Hanger13 said they were making a remake that is true to the original, but they completely lied. Or atleast they're too stupid to know the difference. I waited until I finished the game on classic difficulty before writing a review. I'll make a list of gameplay features that weren't up to standard for a remake of the original.

- Vehicle damage is non existent
Except if you wreck the engine or blow up a car, vehicles can withstand all kinds of damage without any affect on their performance. You can smash into a wall at full speed and keep driving like it's new. It suffers from the same vehicle damage mechanics that have been used since Mafia 2. One of the best features in the original Mafia was the highly realistic vehicle damage mechanics, but you won't see this again in another mafia game.
- No turn signals on vehicles
- Vehicles are too easy to drive
Vehicles drive like they have power steering and modern engines. They're too fast when they start and reach the legal speed limit in a few seconds. I had to check if simulation driving was actually turned on a few times because it didn't feel like it. The driving is like an arcade game, no sense of realism at all.
- Vehicles start automatically when you get in
A lot of the little ways you can control your vehicle are missing. I didn't play with manual transmission, but I can imagine they screwed that up too. I'm certain that it wouldn't be possible to break the gears and get it stuck on that gear like you could in the original.
- There's dumb street hazards placed on the streets whenever you're being chased so that you can easily lose your pursuers
Right from the first mission this stupid feature shows up to avoid having any kind of challenge in the game.
- You have infinite ammo while driving
- All stop lights have been removed
- There are very few characters that are actually true to the original
The only two I can think of is Frank and Luigi. Don't even get me started on Paulie. I'm so confused why they made Paulie into this retard. Not a single character talks or acts like a person from the 1930s would. It doesn't feel like it's set in the 1930s at all.
- You can't use trams, trains, buses, or do taxi jobs
They just completely blocked off access to the train stations. Trams stop and let people off, but you can't get on. They added buses, but you can't get on them either. You can't drive a taxi and take people to their destination outside of one mission in the story. Instead they added transport signs in free ride that teleport you to Salieri's Bar. Really impressive.
- Better car progression throughout the story is completely screwed up
Ralphie is meant to teach you how to steal a car, then that car is available to you for that mission and you can steal it from the streets anytime you want. Now instead you can just steal any car you want from the beginning. I guess doesn't matter anyway because every car feels the same to drive in the remake.
- Lucas Bertone side missions removed
In addition to the last point, this also affects progression and also makes missions shorter.
- There's auto aim on enemy vehicles while driving
You can't aim for the head of the driver or shoot out it's tires. Just keep spamming the centre of the car until it blows up with your infinite ammo.
- Weapon inventory is worse than the original
Still better than Mafia 2 where you could carry infinite weapons in your pocket, but the original Mafia's weapon inventory system allowed you to carry a number of weapons based on what could fit in your clothing.
- No money system in free ride
- The flip car feature
Another feature added to prevent any kind of challenge in the game. Flip your car upside down? Just press the flip car button and magic will you put back on your wheels. But in the original mafia you were in the real world. You needed to steal a new car if this happened.
- Vehicle ramming feature
It's simply a turning exploit used to beat the race mission or turn tight corners in the city.
- You can't remap key bindings to additional mouse buttons
- Can't change the speedometer from mph to kmph
- Some sections of missions doesn't allow you to sprint
Not talking about when you're just walking around Salieri's Bar, but in some fights as well. It's not as bad as in Mafia 2 where it would prevent you from sprinting constantly, but it's still there in some sections.
- Pedestrians don't move out of the way when you honk your horn at them
- Collectables aren't worth the time looking for. Also there's no 1930s equivalent for playboy collectables
- Small scripted events removed
Bridge suicide, dropping bucket on worker at the church, getting drunk on the boat in Happy Birthday, the guy fixing his speed boat when you have to shoot the politician with the sniper from the prison, etc.
- No gas station attendant to refuel your car
- Vehicles will continue to drive after they've run out of fuel
- They said that they have expanded the story, but what they really did was just add more cutscenes
Missions are much shorter and easier to complete even on the hardest difficulty. Driving sections completely cut out even with the skip driving feature turned off. And missions usually just end when you complete the final objective, you don't have to drive back to Salieri's Bar. The game is littered with cutscenes. The original would just have characters doing those things with dialogue while you're still able to walk around with them which is much more realistic and immersive. Everything doesn't need to be a cutscene. This is not the definition of expanding the story. Leave it for the beginning and the end of missions and don't cut missions short and turn it into a cutscene. Also, missions were also structured a lot better in the original. They just added in fights and car chases just for the sake of action in some sections when it doesn't need to be there.
- No profile select. No one else can play your game at home on a separate profile
- Checkpoint save system, making it even easier to finish missions if you die. Instead of using mission chapters like the original
- Constant hand holding
The game doesn't want you to fail in any way or ever get confused and have to think for a second. It treats you like an idiot and displays everything you could ever need to know on the screen. Icons above npcs, on the minimap, gps routes marked on the minimap, and icons on objectives. 18 years later and the transparent map from the original is still better.
- Allies are invincible and also can't be harmed by the player
- Exploding barrels
- The tommy gun has no recoil
- Less vehicles than the original
- Small details missing, such as spent magazines on the ground
- Bullet trails, but no bullet holes
- Ammo pick ups are wasted if your ammo reserves are already full
- You don't reload your gun when you pick up ammo with an empty clip, it's just already reloaded somehow
- Melee combat feels weird and clunky
- Street cops don't react to driving crimes, only police vehicles react to it
- No dogs
- Yellow Pete and his gun shop have been removed from the game
- Only 5 special cars to unlock in free ride


There's only a few things that are better than the original. The shooting is ok, it's good to have a cover system. But it could also have been done better. I would only recommend playing this remake if you want to see an updated version of Lost Heaven with better graphics. That's the main reason to play it over the original. But it's not a good enough reason to buy it. I could do a break down of each mission and all the characters, but that would make my review much longer. Hypothetically, if you just took the original game and updated it's graphics without changing anything else it would be near perfect.

Just buy the original. It's much cheaper and much, much better.",1601372008,1601721334,FALSE,5,0,0.522565842,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,894,3,904,904,880,1601800603
8,Mafia Definitive Edition,76939347,english,"I will give this game a 6/10 because while it does a great job in recapturing Lost Heaven on the modern platform, it loses out on the immersion of what it means to become a gangster. Combat feels dumbed down (as expected, especially  with Mafia 2, although I  think Mafia 2 is still a good game). As far as  a remake goes, this is DECENT, nothing great or nothing bad BUT it in no way feels like it pays much homage to the original Mafia fanbase. The first sequence : drive through a spot and a cutscene plays? Really???.

I generally thought this game was OK but it definitely doesn't hit the notes anywhere near the original classic did. Even if we didn't compare this to the classic, it's just bare bones, and while story focused, it didn't feel like I wanted to care much for the characters, Tommy just feels way too cocky for a cab driver who just got a baseball bat to the face (and to his taxi car). 

I know Mafia is focused on story but I really felt there was nothing other than driving to do (you can at least take the train and tram on the original ), the devs could have at least flexed a bit and went, hey here's more you can do in Lost Heaven now that you couldn't in the original. But even still,  the original felt way more immersive than this remake because not everything was done in fucking cutscenes every god damn second. And whats with Paulie?????

The shooting mechanics are garbage. The pistol cross hair is a big circle so it makes precision aiming nearly impossible. 

The car chases are lame. They ALWAYS throw you in the slowest lemon that cant turn then add their little rubber band mechanic. Just an awful decision. Actually all the controls are rather clunky here. I find myself battling the bad UI and controls as much as the bad guys. I get its a remaster of an old game.

I'm a purist of the original, its one of my favourite games of all time. It's clear there is some love and a lot of hard work & attention to detail in this game, but it's not very faithful. The game is gorgeous, the world is very alive and atmospheric.
The pacing is a bit too quick for my liking, the game gives you a chance to explore your surroundings a little but the plot and characters try to hurry you along. I've unlocked about 25 cars but only driven maybe 5?
The combat is weak and footage of it speaks for itself. But it is serviceable for the story/plot.
Sound is good, lots of little details. Performance is good on my gaming laptop. HDR too.
4hrs in and the voice acting is still bothering me. Tommy delivers his lines through his nose and sounds like an extra from a bad mob movie. Paulie sounds like a cartoon character. Mr Salieri is the standout performance by far. Fortunately the dialogue is quite good, with some homages to the original but very much re-written.

There are some truly great moments in this game that shocked me and moved me, and I felt very satisfied overall when the credits started rolling. It isn't perfect, however. The game feels rushed as it goes on. The story in the latter half seems to jump from one thing to the next with no explanation of what happened in-between time periods, and it can start to feel like you are watching a TV show with distinct episodes rather than a cohesive story. I've heard that this remake has cut some story content (I've never played the original), so that may be the reason. Overall though, the story is definitely the best part of this game and I still found it to be satisfying and gripping despite its flaws in the latter half. 

The game stumbles with its gunplay. The shooting doesn't feel good, and your character is so hyper-animated that it can be hard to get in or out of cover, which can lead to you getting shot and killed very quickly. Enemies are bullet sponges unless you land headshots, which is somewhat hard to do due to the animation issues mentioned previously and the massive crosshair that makes guns feel very inaccurate. Shooting sections can feel punishingly difficult as well, but your mileage may vary. 

Driving isn't as bad. The vehicles feel fine to drive, but car chases can feel very repetitive and boring since cars move somewhat slowly and vehicular combat doesn't really work well. 

There are some pretty interesting and cool levels, especially around the late 1st and early 2nd acts of the game when the action begins to rise. As the story goes on, the level design and mission structure begins to get pretty repetitive, but I suppose the same criticism can be applied to other shooters. 

Overall, despite my criticisms, I would recommend this game. I really enjoyed the story despite my issues with the latter half, and I had a good time with it when all is said and done.

33,Mafia Definitive Edition,76950518,english,"Mafia Definitive Edition is the same ride that veterans of the original will remember fondly, yet still feels fresh nearly 20 years later. 

It is the same story with some minor details and extra scenes to flesh out the characters, their relationship to Tommy, and their role in the story. For example, Paulie and Sam come with you on more missions, even if the mission is, ultimately, down to you as Tommy. But the extra dialogue fleshes out their relationship with Tommy and emphasizes the story's turns later on. 

It is the Mafia 3 engine, just improved. It wasn't the garbage that game with the first run of Mafia 3. I have no experience with Mafia 3 Definitive Edition, but the reviews speak for that game themselves. The engine in this one seems okay, the optimization leaves much to be desired, but the gameplay elements and graphics are good. There aren't as many graphical glitches as Mafia 3 had, and the gunplay and driving are quite a bit of fun (just don't expect anything revolutionary). Part of me suspects that the driving isn't so bad because the cars are generally heavier and slower, but I'm not the expert on that front. 

There are a few changes to the game that are notable, the biggest being the lack of side missions. Specifically, Lucas originally gave you side missions during certain chapters for you to go do something and get rewarded with a special car. These cars were generally better than anything the game was going to give you normally, and the missions were a lot of fun. Instead, he gives you post cards for you to go find the cars yourself. Him giving you the locations is the reward in the story's sense. So the side missions are basically downgraded to collectibles. I appreciate having the new cars, I'm just a little disappointed to see that feature go. I can't say much about the omission of free ride extreme, but they mentioned adding in some secrets somewhere in the regular free ride mode as a nod to the wacky crap you saw in the original. 

All of that said, I've played the original game many many times over the years, and I can say that this remake made me a very happy man. It brought me back to the good old days of gaming, but it kept me paying attention to the new style. I'd recommend anyone give it a try, whether you played the original or not. This is the game that made Mafia 2. 

I'd say Hanger 13 redeemed themselves, I just ask that they learn from the mistakes of Mafia 3 and let this game be a reminder of what we want from a good Mafia game. 

And for those of you who are veterans of the original, the race mission sucks just as much as it did before. Enjoy.",1601704263,1601704263,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,368,44,795,795,795,1601703408

38,Mafia Definitive Edition,76949129,english,"What they did to this game is awful.  

They took the cinematic aspect of the game and pushed much harder for it to be a cinematic experience over being interactive.  Much of the acting can range from cartoonish and out of character or to the point that they're taking it so seriously they lose their humanity and feel like cut out movie characters.  Namely, Paulie is a cartoon, Sam is a dummy, Salieri is a dry Don Corleone, Tommy is a much less ordinary guy and acts like Lincoln Clay whom had been well equipped for being up to no good.  Other characters like Morello lose their threatening caricature, and many others may be decent enough but don't have the memorability of their originals.

None of the rewrites are of any interest other than to feign some type of detail they largely couldn't do through city or interactivity.  The script in itself was a perfect writing without need for the amount of rewrites they've done as they've all majority overexplained or compromised the story in some way or another.  Even with all this 'beefing up the story and connections' had me caring much less for the characters than the original had them written originally.  Whether that's because of the lackluster voice acting where pretty much the whole cast ended up sounding Canadian instead of American Italian or even American or the action movie script is up to interpretation.

Many levels suck out the interactivity that was once had in exchange for hard scripted cutscenes that take away from the action.  With the loss of interactivity has also come the loss of atmosphere in memorable cutscenes or levels.  Many of the situations play out like movie scenes instead of a much more structured realism in how the events had gone.  Where the first chase in the game relied much heavier on skill by fighting with the speed of the vehicle to properly evading Morello's men, it's now a point A to B going along to guided accident areas with cutscene showing you masterfully maneuvering through them and Morello's men weakly crashing.  The second chase succeeding the motel where Sam and Paulie are ambushed continues this with lock-on aiming and your skill being diminished due to heavy scripting, and throughout the game you will notice a recurring theme that many of the driving segments have been removed entirely, for cutscenes, or rescripted to where the chases are much more action-centric.

All tension within these levels is nonexistent and along with it something else bubbles to the surface that has been steaming since after the first cinematic comes to an end and you are able to drive within the said first car chase of the game.  Much of the script editing and additions that are ""adding to the story"" come across as the cast not knowing when to shut up the majority of the time.  The stupidity of Paulie and Sam getting into a cab and detailing what they've just done and how they ended up there in earshot of some cabbie that'll know exactly where their hideout is, chit chat during car rides, character edits like with Morello once being much more threatening instead of the cool as a cucumber careless businessman that sometimes kills, the scripted segments inbetween action sequences, shortening of sequences like in Running Man, and prolonged sequences such as in Molotov Party with a SPECIAL stealth section that comes with the new Tommy Angelo being made out to be a parkour expert.  Lucas Bertone's side missions removed for completely side based hidden cars in free-ride.

Certain details have also been lost like when you'd flip an open-top car only to die because your head would be crushed having been replaced with the ability to flip your car at any given point even in classic mode so that you NEVER need to worry about such an inconvenience.  Odometer somewhat obviously being lost as well as the ability to interact with light switches or toilets, but still the loss of neat little features that not many games have.  Watching the backlot of Salieri's grow with vehicles is gone and replaced with an infinity garage system similar to Mafia 2 that houses all your neat vehicles such as period appropriates like the Samson Drifter (1970 Dodge Charger) and a Schubert Frigate (1953 Chevrolet Corvette).  Despite both of these vehicles being game ownership bonuses meant for some subtle fanservice, even in free ride, I personally would not want to see these as they further cement the lack of interest Hangar 13 has in detail pertaining to the time period compared to the original developers, Illusion Softworks (2K Czech).  One minor success particular to the rewrites is the fleshing out of the taxi fare sequence in a way to where instead of the fares being in succession, you have to drive around looking for them.  

However, this sequence has been made to feel much shorter and you come to notice some of the tweaking to gameplay elements where driving feels although weighted also feels too arcadey in handling with higher speeds almost coming close to a good tight feeling, however with them being older vehicles they seem to have a pretty quick 'get up and go' attitude.  Police even on classic difficulty feel like they give too much slack to where you can get away with many of the laws pretty easily as they don't pay attention as often as the original.  Enemy AI are always spawned in pre-determined areas so there's absolutely no freewill among them nor needing to pay any mind to where they may be since they're always in the same place every playthrough.  Some animations have either been redone or removed in part with lockpicking being shortened, medicine cabinets losing the animation of Tommy properly interacting with them instead of an instant stat boost, almost entirely feeling like Tommy controls like Lincoln Clay in medface, and the carelessness of throwing a molotov.  Vehicle deformation has been largely touched up to the point of full on collisions doing trace amounts of visual damage and only lightly damaging the handling of the vehicle.

Coming back to the cinematic move to movie game, much of the shortness to sequences seems to come from there being a loss in exposition towards what the developers/writers felt was unnecessary to which they divulge each sequence towards the loss of realism as well as the loss of the more mundane aspects of being a gangster making them somewhat humanlike adding to it a visual experience close to watching a movie.  This of course hearkens back both to Hangar 13's feeling with Mafia III and 2K's vision of Mafia II leading to much of its cut content of trying to make a game about nonstop action and Hollywood movie influence instead of a game involving a world underneath the commoners where there is a larger sense of humanity and realistic human portrayals that have been lightly influenced by popular entertainment media.  Although the racing sequence has been updated relatively faithfully and somehow feels more difficult than the original there is that loss of exposition in how the day after stealing the car is introduced and when Tommy enters the race.

If you've played through the first couple of missions, you're going to have pretty much experienced all of what the game has to offer.  A lot of this remake feels like it's either shortened sequences, rewrote too much unnecessary dialogue into the story, killed the atmosphere, or taken away from what made the original game so captivating, memorable, and refreshing even after multiple playthroughs.  With this one, I can only lastly say that it's not one I will be coming back to anytime soon when the first game was an immediate replay for me.  

It sure looks pretty, but too much of this just feels like a reboot meant to completely change the face of the series so that people forget its previous originality and whatever realism or detail the original developers had intended, so that now they can push out new Mafia named titles bearing little similarity to the original vision of the franchise.",1601701632,1601701632,FALSE,3,0,0.531885386,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,1197,5,1711,1711,1711,1601677653

I hadn't previously played the original Mafia coming into the definitive edition, so the story, characters and world was completely new to me. Some people have complained about the cover system and the combat in general. I find it lacking in some places, especially when it comes to molotov's and grenades they just don't feel powerful enough to me and are only really useful against a group of enemies or cars. Overall I find the combat to be adequate, nothing really to point out, the only criticism I have is that sometimes ammunition can feel limited or in some missions you realise that you brought the wrong gun for the mission, due to the proximity of enemies in some areas. 

As for the story, I really enjoyed it, the rise and fall of Tommy Angelo's life of crime is believable and you sympathise with Tom, Paulie, Sam, Don Salieri and the rest of the gang. I advise not turning on the Skip Unnecessary Drive option as taking a good, regular drive through Lost Heaven really immerses you into the setting and time period of the game.

71,Mafia Definitive Edition,76620962,english,"Well, I got over the whole racing-level-thing (see below for my original frustration-driven review) and finished the game, but I suppose that I'll stick to my thumbs-down conclusion, and here's why:

The game's only real strength is its story as well as its characters. However, only in the first ~40% of the game you are dealing with many interesting characters, whereas for the remaining 60% there's just the four main characters and anybody else mostly just plays some side role during the cut scenes.

The problem is that aside from story and characters, every other aspect of the game is just 'okay' at best. The driving is okay, the shooting is okay-ish, but virtually all of the weapons in the game feel clunky and useless. And unfortunately, the game offers very little beyond that. The ""open"" world is actually quite nice to look at and also the cars are actually quite nice, but unfortunately, the whole ""open world"" feels completely wasted. There is no open quest system, but instead you are running one main mission after the other, so you don't even have any real opportunity to explore the world or to drive around freely in the various cars. All in all, I would have preferred a more 'open' game.

-- ORIGINAL REVIEW --
The game was quite fun for the first 2 hours until the devs decided to ruin my precious saturday evening with some stupid racing level, whose difficulty is just completely off compared to the rest of the game. Now, since the game won't let you continue until you win that race -- even when you lose the race ten times in a row -- the only way for me was to lower the difficulty from the highest to the lowest setting to get through that race. However, after that I just don't care for the game or its story anymore and I don't really feel the need or wish to continue playing it.

I guess it's a perfect example of how a single bad level can ruin a whole game.",1601155163,1601678789,FALSE,0,1,0.436241627,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,523,16,713,713,713,1601673854

My hope is that they add more content besides the main campaign and these so called bonus missions, because the game is really great and if they filled in the ending a bit more, and also added side missions, the game would be a 10/10 from me.

So many bugs that can be game-breaking, from cut scenes that don't have sound to car and gun sounds missing and the major crashing and freezing constantly! Can't play more than 10 minutes without it freezing for at least 2 minutes before coming back on.
I've been waiting for an update since it's release but as of yet no word from the dev team, which annoys me as I'd usually wait for an update but the game (minus bugs) is stunning and amazing to play (Story mode only).

Free mode is very plain and there's nothing really to do, it's a very bland world when your not doing missions and have completed the game. They need to bring back taxi missions....etc like in the original.

Once the bugs have been fixed I will update my review but as of now, I wouldn't recommend the game as you can't enjoy it.

I've played the original Mafia in the early 2000s and have been keeping up with the series up to Mafia III. Aside from the absence of a number of mechanics of the original (vehicle lock picking mini game, side-quests by Ralphie (Lucas Bertone's were moved to 'free ride'), accessible public transports), Mafia: DE built upon and improved upon on mainly what made the franchise great: the story and the driving. 

The script and lines were vastly improved, smoothing the dialogue of the original and further fleshes out the characters we remembered and built upon their legacy. There are a few changes taken to some the missions, but they mostly play closely like the original and serve much better to complement the narrative and the characters.

Pros;
- Story and characters are great. Tone is different from original, but events pretty much the same. Characters have more dialog and screen-time and very interesting. Story develops steadily and really feels like a mafia movie. 
- Graphics and performance are good. Graphics level is not better than Mafia 3, but does not have annoying amount of glitches and bugs.
- Lost Heaven design and atmosphere are on point. It's enjoyable to just cruise through town.
Cons:
- Some missions made to be bombastic and look stupid and belong more to Fast and Furious franchise than Mafia game. I am talking about first mission and armored car chase.
- Difficulty spikes for race and armored car chase. Race was very difficult in original, which does not make it good game design. it's kinda common sense that taxi driver not able to compete with racing drivers, but still you need to win. Both times I played original, I've used exploit to get through race fast, in remake I've just decreased difficulty. Armored car chase just stupid and belongs to a different game.
- Shooting is barely functional. It's slow, you have huge Halo-like rectangle and no precision whatsoever.

24,Mafia Definitive Edition,76920223,english,"To be truy disappointed, you have to get your hopes up, first.

Now, when the remaster of Mafia II came out a while back, I read the reviews and watched some videos and came to the conclusion that Mafia II original was probably the better game. I had already played it, it was a bad story and unlikeable characters, too arcadey and too easy, but at least the gunplay was somewhat weighty and the controls were somewhat satisfying.

Mafia I is one of my all-time favorite games. Of course, with somewhat nostalgia-tinted glasses; I realize that the story could've been told a bit more smoothly with more modern writing, some cliches could've been a bit more reflected, but overall, it was the most charming game set in a modern city that I have played as of yet. Much less annoying than GTA.

I was wary when Mafia I: Definitive Edition released. And I was right to be: This is NOT the definitive edition of Mafia I. The true definitive edition of Mafia I is the original. Get it on disc if possible, because the music really makes the atmosphere of Lost Heaven as a town, and it's no longer included in digital copies of the original game for, presumably, copyright reasons.

But even though I'd been aware of the probable failure that the remaster would be, I still bought it after reading a lot of positive reviews. And they aren't entirely wrong. Lost Heaven looks familiar. Different, but familiar. The intro - the original score, the same camera ride through the town, dodging cars as the music grew more tense... It felt like they had truly attempted to remake the game. Obviously I selected the classic difficulty setting which was said to make the game play similarly to Mafia I itself.

Well... It all started to fall apart as soon as Detective Norman began to speak. While he wasn't exactly a charming character in the original, he was portrayed way over the top right from the start. Darker. Grittier. As was Thomas Angelo. They really didn't need to be portrayed differently. More competently maybe, but the changes made to all of the characters in the game seemed to be for the worse. The first time Paulie and you get that crappy old Bolt (Ford) from Salieri's garage, his snippy attitude towards Ralphy was changed into excessive abuse. Whereas before he was portrayed as a somewhat pitiful bully with a heart, he now behaved like just a cliche bully. Ralph, always seeming like the nicest person in Lost Heaven, was made to quip about sabotaging a car to get revenge on Paulie. It's obviously just a frustrated remark, but the original characters didn't seem like such enemies - they seemed like colleagues getting somewhat below the belt line with their quips. These remade ones... Nah. It's the same problem throughout. The writing hasn't matured as I had hoped... It confused maturity with ""let's just make everyone seem as gritty as possible"".

But that's not the thing that stopped me playing for the time being. The presentation and controls did. Sure, everything looks a bit better... Well, it looks more bland, too, but you can still recognize the most important landmarks and get a bit swept up in nostalgia. On the other hand, even though the street layout looked very similiar to the original, I got lost despite knowing Lost Heaven like the back of my hand. Key areas were changed for no reason, like Salieri's bar being moved for no reason at all.

The biggest problem however is the character animation and control scheme. Even on the most realistic settings, the cars handle like scooters. Controlling Tommy requires repeated, well-timed, presses of the 'walk' button to stop him from running. Every time you come to a halt, the mode resets to run. And you can only reset it back to walk while moving. It's really stressful just to walk about. And then there's a run beyond running, making any chase way too easy because of the sheer speed. The police, a real threat in the original, can never catch up to Tommy in this version. I tried: Shot at a police cruiser, and ran. Just ran away. In a straight line. They caught up, left their vehicle, shot a few times in my general direction (missing almost every time on highest difficulty, but this was already a problem in Mafia I), and then began to chase me on foot. I lost them just running forward. It's ridiculous.
Not to speak of the fact that I had to actually hit them once to get them angry enough to fire at me. Just shooting in the air once in Mafia I would get the police in the whole area alerted and returning lethal fire. Here, they only start using force once you actually wound someone... Even near-misses with lethal weapons do not anger the police.
But I'm losing my train of thought - I was talking about the movement animations and controls. Just standing still looks silly. Tommy in Mafia I would somewhat timidly stand around when idle, sometimes brushing some dust off his expensive suit. He was charming, in a way, just from the animations. Climbing and running always looked as if he overexerted himself, getting up any ledge was a slow animation, and you'd really feel as if your attire and training hadn't prepared you for action like that. It made sense. He's a taxi driver turned gentleman assassin. He's not a soldier.

But seeing how the protagonists of both Mafia II and III had had military backgrounds, it seems any Mafia main character's animations from now on must look like they are a buff fighter just waiting to get into a brawl. Thomas' idle animation is him practically flexing at thin air, looking mean and aggressive. That's not the Thomas Angelo I played. A kid who got into the wrong company, letting himself be manipulated to commit crime, while being timid at heart. Christ, his name is Angelo. But, alas. No. He's now a soldier.

And he climbs, runs, even enters and exits cars in such a hurry and with such aggression. That's what stopped me playing. I wanted to stroll around town in Free Ride, getting back into that power fantasy of being a Mafia hitman, acting as gentle as possible while always ready to kill.
That's not possible in this game. I can't stroll. I can only prance about like a gorilla with indigestion and a strange form of epilepsy that presents as seizures when attempting to walk, making me stumble and then, probably for fear of looking stupid, run at full speed. Every. Time. I. Want. To. Walk.

Not to mention all the on-screen information that was neither present nor necessary in the original. I don't want fucking quest markers. Let me explore and find my way.

And if that didn't convince you yet, have at this:

You remember the first mission, right? The one where Tommy wanted to just smoke a cigarette and inspect his tire, when suddenly a crash was heard and Sam and Paulie would kidnap him alongside his Taxi and force him, in a very though and adrenaline-fueled race, to lose some gangsters in a different car?

Well, now it's 10 cars. Or something. They keep respawning. You shake them by following some quest markers into construction sites, which play the same cutscene each time of the car gently bumping a barrier and exploding as your Taxi auto-pilots through. Do that a bunch of times and you'll then be told to actually flee across the bridge - you know, the one that raises and lowers to let through boats? It's now a scripted scene. You fly over the bridge, the cars abandon chase, and you bring the guys to Salieri's bar.
And what if you get cornered by one of the cars? Sam shoots at it five times and it explodes.

I remember exactly the sweet spots of all the car models; you know, the areas you had to hit for special effects. Gasoline leaks, cars exploding. I remember having to fire a considerably long burst of Thompson 1928 fire straight onto the hood of a vehicle - specific parts of it to be precise, preferably from a 0° angle from the front - until I was rewarded with an awesome explosion. Now every enemy car is a Bolt Ace (Ford T). Fuck this.

35,Mafia Definitive Edition,76761174,english,"Negatives/Things I did not like:
🅞 Visiting Rich People. The villa level design has changed and not in a good way. Before you could do the mission stealthily but now the safe alarm is triggered no matter what, ruining the stealth element. The whole charm of that mission in the original was to do it stealthily and leave with the glorious Silver Fletcher.
🅞 The bank job is not as exciting as in the Original. I still remember the thrill of casing the bank and hearing the plan from Paulie (who back then was more mature and intelligent and less of a man baby). In the Defintive Edition the mission happens very fast and feels dumbed down.
🅞 The ability to Dodge/Ram cars which actually makes hand breaking redundant as the ability can make the car steer sideways and keeps it glued to the ground. Very helpful in the race mission (finished it very fast on Classic difficulty) but overall reduces the realism and makes driving feel arcade.
🅞 Car physics. I don't understand how a game that was released 18 years ago can have better car physics than what we got today. In the Original, depending on the speed and the angle of the crash, cars could lose wheels, bumpers. In the Definitive Edition you can crash at 120km without considerable damage to the car, character and other traffic participants. The cars that you crash into at high speeds fly like they are weightless (Classic Difficulty + Simulation driving)
🅞 Tommy is no longer taught how to lock pick cars. He already knows how to pick them all after a cutscene. In the Original he would gradually learn how to pick each type of lock for every model. They decided to go with the quick and cheap way instead of trying to add more depth to this mechanic that was so important in the original. As a fan I would have wanted to see a lockpicking mini-game like in Mafia 2 or something similar
🅞 The plate numbers are not remembered when evading the police like in Mafia Original and 2. The Wanted status is lost when going outside of the search area. 
🅞 Pedestrians are not reacting to lockpicking. Stole over 40 cars and only once a pedestrian called the cops on the highest police difficulty 
🅞 The horizontal axis of steering is way too fast making any car feel arcade when turning, unless you modify the steering sensitivity when playing with a controller
🅞 There is no animation when filling up the tank at the gas station like in the original
🅞 Lucas Bertone no longer sends you to do jobs for him. The treasure hunt mechanic for finding the rare cars is barely explored…
🅞 Lots of driving portions were removed to accentuate the movie feeling. I personally would have liked to have them like in the original.
🅞 Too many enemies that are too easy to kill even on the hardest difficulty.
🅞 Paulie and Sam's voices are very similar. Also Paulie seems too much of a crybaby and less of an impulsive gangster like we are used to. 
🅞 Free Ride could have been a lot better by allowing to earn money and spend them on various things such as clothes, car improvements, weapons, etc. 
🅞 Outfits are cool but not being able to mix and match clothes is a bit of a bummer. In 2002 would have been hard to implement but now, with the current tech should have not been a problem.
🅞 Too much guidance even on Classic difficulty. The game takes your hand and guides you to whatever you have to do. One of the strongest points of the Original was the sandbox vibe and the liberty it offered (more like in Hitman where you have to figure things out yourself). Missions feel a lot more scripted and linear and less exploration oriented.

Things done right:
🅞 Graphics. Extremely beautiful car models and characters
🅞 Narrative changes in some regards
🅞 Music and Score
🅞 Collectables and the fact that are displayed on the map when in near vecinity 
🅞 Expanded Country side
🅞 Extreme Rides and Weapons side missions

Overall I think it was a great effort to bring back to life the masterpiece that Mafia 1 was but they missed on some key points, probably because this was treated as a side project within Hangar13.
I'm giving a negative feedback only to attract Hangar13's attention. Maybe they will take our feedback in consideration.

46,Mafia Definitive Edition,76686947,english,"Not a bad game, but a really BAD REMAKE completely oblivious to the vision of the original Mafia game. 
Story changes are not completely bad only in few places (Sarah storyline, Sam and broad), in most places they are just completely for the worse (general philosophy of the story, lack of message, shortening of the story, completely ruined finale and ending). 

Rather than on realism, it tries to bet on streamlined gameplay, which is still does not do too well, and instead of well though-out and thoroughly researched mechanics of the original game, it reuses the dumb-down mechanics of Mafia 3. 
MIssion-wise it becomes linear scripted experience, instead of the original fun of realistic sandbox.
And when some parts of it are hard, they are not hard by design, only by bad design.

I would rather call it reboot than remake, because it takes most of the best things about the original game, throws them into trash, and replaces it with mostly worse ""new"" stuff (usually reused from Mafia 3), if it even bothers to replace them, on lot of places it just leaves a gaping holes, left from the lack of stuff that was there for a reason in the original.

But at least it has nicely done locations, pretty graphics, epic soundtrack (even tho its lacking some of the songs from the original), and well done voice overs (at least in English and Czech)

I would rather send new players to play the original, and I would suggest to old player to avoid it, to not ruin the memory of the original, so I dont really understand who the game is meant for.

[i]I can't personally speak for how close this game hews to the original, but from what I have read it's quite close, so the majority of fans out there who hold the original in high esteem should mostly be satisfied. Hangar 13 has done a great job breathing new life back into a cult classic that I tried to play for the first time, about two years ago, but didn't make it very far on the account of it not having aged very well at all. Despite the fact I was really enjoying the narrative, the gameplay was just too old and clunky for me so when I heard a remake was in the works, I was more than happy to wait. 

This new version of [b]Mafia[/b] certainly oozes tremendous style and graphically it looks quite superb. This is hands down one of the best looking games I have played from an environment perspective, and when I found out it uses a form of software ray tracing developed inhouse at Hangar 13, I was even more impressed. If the lighting and reflections in this game are a portend of what we can possibly expect from the next generation of games, then I can't wait to see how far game developers push into this heightened realism. 

The game does fall down a bit when it comes to character animations, as they can be incredibly wonky, and it did feel slightly dated to play especially how the game presents the mission structure to the player, the cover system, to the combat. For the most part, [b]Mafia Definitive Edition[/b] ran superbly, without any performance hiccups. I did encounter a sound bug where I would periodically lose sound or music or both that I did find quite irritating. 

If you are looking for a game that strikes an excellent tone between narrative and atmosphere then [b]Mafia Definitive Edition[/b] should suffice, just know what you are getting yourself into in the event you are looking for something that plays a bit more modern.[/i]

[h1]One word or phrase to sum up the experience[/h1]
[i]Good-looking[/i]

[h1]Performance/Bug related incidents[/h1]
[i]Game kept losing sound forcing me to have to close it down and reboot it back up. In some instances music wouldn't play at all but I could hear the game sound effect. In other instances all that played was the music and I lost all game sounds like voice and sound effects. This seemes to happen quite often and I found it to be quite annoying.[/i]

[h1]Similar to games[/h1]
[i]Grand Theft Auto V, L.A. Noire, The Godfather[/i]

57,Mafia Definitive Edition,76911480,english,"Mafia Definitive Edition is a faithful and lovingly crafted remake that most fans of the original will enjoy thoroughly. The Definitive edition is a remake in every sense of the word, i.e., graphics, sound, assets, dialogues, cutscenes and even the way the quests play out is redone. 

Now, even though the objectives for each mission remains the same, the way that you get through them is very different to the original. That is a great thing but at the same time, some missions have been shortened, most notably, the ""You Lucky B"". I won't say anymore 'cause it'll be a spoiler but the mission is fun nonetheless. Plus, the original had alternate kills associated with a couple of missions. Those are missing here.

One aspect that I didn't like about the Definitive Edition is that the you go from one chapter to the next like they're quest objectives. In the original, you could unlock some rare cars by doing side missions for Lucas Bertone in between chapters and this added some variety to the game, even though it did nothing for the narrative. I think that's the reason why these missions have been removed. You play only the story missions. 

In terms of gameplay, the Definitive Edition features new animations, cover system and melee fighting. There's a smooth parkour setup which allows the players to vault over cover, climb fences and jump over other kinds of obstacles. The roll is missing, however. There's a stealth element to the game where you can sneak up on enemies and take them down silently but this makes the game very, very easy. You can even wait for an enemy to come around the corner and do a silent take-down by pushing one button. It's like an ""I Win"" button given to the player which makes most missions trivial whereas in the original, you had to be very careful and knock them unconscious with a power attack from a baseball bat or something. 

The original had a Free Ride Extreme mode where you did whacky missions. That's there in the Definitive Edition. It's well hidden and you need to start it from Salieri's Bar. You can change weather and Day/Night using the paintings, which is again, not very obvious. So, be sure to look out for these. They're fun but a couple of missions have been omitted. You still get 15 missions here. Besides those, there are loads of collectibles that you can get from the main story missions and Free Ride. These range from a few unlockable secret cars to mostly magazine covers and statues. 

Overall, I definitely recommend this remake for fans of the original game who'd like to experience Mafia 1 again but differently this time. Even though the pacing is too rapid, some missions have been shortened and whatnot and a few things missing like the original soundtracks replaced by 2 radio stations (these are still good but I do miss the original soundtracks, especially Minor Swing by Django Reindhart and the Chinatown song), the Definitive Edition is a solid game and warrants a place on your shelf.",1601645232,1601645232,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,124,2,1963,1963,1636,1601810581

- melee combat is awful and key bindings are stupid

They made changes to most aspects of the originals design, combat, story, characters, and it was not for the better.

The combat went from being intense and unforgiving to a generic duck-and-cover shooting gallery in the vein of every console shooter on the market.

The changes to the story changes the focus of the game entirely, such as a forced, romantic plot that in the original happened off camera entirely, whilst entire sections of the originals were left out entirely.

Hangar 13's remake of the original Mafia (2002) really lives up to the expectations. Lost Heaven feels alive through beautiful graphics, an excellent voice acting, and the heart-touching story.

85,Mafia Definitive Edition,76898674,english,"I have played every Mafia game made and finished it twice. I have not finished Mafia: DE at the time of this review but here is my 2 cents.

Pros
+ Faithful Remaster with great textures
+ Immersive story that makes the characters truly come alive with emotions
+ Gameplay and Driving mechanics are pretty good.
+ Original story increased to give you a better mafia feel.

Cons
- The Story at times feels like we're playing it in bits and pieces. Mafia 2 made it seem like the story was your everyday. This can be improved with a simple Go home or Go to bed at the end of a chapter. 
- Although textures are amazing they feel cartoony at times but its barely noticeable.
- Few bugs like sound dropping out in a cutscene or one of the characters you're supposed to chase (not kill) get stuck and you have to reload at checkpoint to progress. These are minor and easily fixable.

All in all the cons are very minute and little in number. The pros make up for the cons and its an amazing game. The folks at Hanger 13 have listened to fans and delivered a game that has many aspects of the first 2 games. It's an amazing game and definitely worth the money.

91,Mafia Definitive Edition,76846263,english,"This was my original review after a few hours of playing:

(Love the og. The remake is pretty good, but: remove the fps cap, and please give us the option to turn off certain HUD elements. I respect what you did in terms of accessibility, but it would be nice to have the option in the menu to remove objective markers and the mini map (fom missions like ""Happy Birthday""). Otherwise, great game)

After finishing it, I will not change the thumbs up. I believe everyone should experience this story. It is less flushed out, the characters are a little weaker than in the original, but the performances are amazing. When it comes to the game's performance however, I am severely disappointed. 

Just like in Mafia III, the lighting is incomprehensible when you change locations. It got me killed so many times, when I'm in cover at the door aiming at the exterior and I can't see anything. Just really bright white light, as if someone has put two through my head. AI is erratic and unpredictable (not in a good way). Animation glitches and pathfinding always ruin the experience. Playing on classic difficulty does not reflect the original's trial and error structure, but it's still annoying when you die from a bullet of an enemy that's either zipping around cove like it's gears of war, or dying from not being able to see through doors and windows.

I also disliked how the game ran on my 3900x/2080ti machine -- 60fps lock unless you go borderless (just as bad as mafia III). The game looks stunning when it stands still, but start moving or running away from cops and you'll be watching an artifact cancan. White halos over every object and character, along with horrible object pop-in that's prevalent in Mafia II Definitive Edition. But when it comes to texture streaming and decals -- it looks immaculate. Not even in Red Dead 2 can you see such high definition decals for posters and ads, it's very impressive. 

Along with the graphics, the sound design is hit or miss. It definitely hits the bullsye in the atmosphere department: I remember visiting a bar under the metro track, and when the train passed all the glasses and pictures on the wall started clacking and moving. It felt real. Where it misses, is in places like dialogue: in the beginning of the game I could not hear a thing Sam and Paulie were saying. It sucks when you have to read the subtitles while evading the police. 

Overall, I liked the game. I loved re-living this life again, with all it's ups and downs. I want to go back into that world, but something stops me. For every amazing memory, I have three negative ones. I hope that Hangar 13 implements some changes into the engine and their AI, because these fixes would make the game and actual Definitive edition of the Mafia. Foe now, I recommend that everyone who loves old mob or Scorseze movies checks this story out.

17,Mafia Definitive Edition,76889237,english,"I only got into gaming a few years ago. In those beginning years of course, you hear from long time gamer's, of those certain top tier games that really pushed the gaming genre forward. People saying how unlucky you were to grace their beautiful presence, and experience what they have to offer. From RE2/3, to Bioshock and of course, Mafia. Although I wasn't really thinking about Mafia all too much, lucky me, here it is, released as an Definitive Edition.

Graphics 
Wow....Just wow. This is one of those games you just stop and stare at the world around you, while taking it all in. Not being able to stop jaw dropping at how beautifully crafted this city really is. It is easily one of my most favorite crafted cities. From back allies, to store fronts, Hanger really took their time to design Lost Heaven. It feels real. Driving around all I could really think is, ""how did they do this?"" and ""when can I go there?"". It really is something to experience. 

Sounds
FINALLY! Guns sound bada**! They look, shoot, act, as the guns of the 1930's. From the slick, 1911, to the original shredder, Tommy gun. Every shot feels authentic. I have ZERO complaints on this one. But it doesn't stop there. Hangar goes that extra mile and gives just about every vehicle a tune up! Even if the car is actually slow, the engine in these things sound like a beast ready to break free! Hearing that engine rev, in intense moments, or not, you find yourself ready for some classic mafia, car chase to start out of nowhere, with machine guns blazing, tires screeching, raining shell casings across the city like bread crumbs. This game knows how to light you up! The city doesn't disappoint either. Birds chirping, dogs barking, cars going by, trams rolling through, and even the wires leading the tram, have their own sound effects (I was blown away by the last one). The cherry on top is the radio. From the masterfully crafted music score, to listening to  the end of a world series baseball game. If you like immersion, this game will take you their! 

Acting 
This is why Mafia was beloved by so many (from my understanding). Every character pops! If it wasn't for all the interacting / inputs going on with your controls, this could easily be mistaken for one of the greatest Mafia movies ever made. By the end, you're invested to each character and most likely, know them by name. From Tommy, Sam, Pauli to, Sarelli, Sarah and Frank. You know the Family. And you betta not mess wit em', KA-peesh?

Story
You start as a lonely cab driver, making you wages through the night, taking a smoke break. Outta nowhere, you get a glimpse of a car chase going wrong. Your character, Tommy, peaks around the street corner to see what the noise is all about. Out pops two gangsters, guns drawn, not giving Tommy much of a choice but to drive. By getting away, this helps give Tommy good graces with the neighborhood Don. Offered a job, Tommy turns it down. The next day, as you drive fares around the city, Tommy is eventually confronted by some hoods looking to settle a score with him. Tommy only has one place to go to get away.... From there, you will see the life of a man looking to retire with money in his pocket, and not a care in the world. This story REALLY brings meaning to, ""started from the bottom, now we're here"". 

Side note
Play Mafia on classical difficulty, manual driving, and traffic violations on! Trust me. 

Gripes! 
As much as I love Mafia, and happy to have it apart of my collection, there are issues. Issues where I found myself clinching my fists and setting down my controller. 

First, aiming. I have never experienced this before, but when aiming, for some odd reason, Tommy likes to aim, left, or right, of the target. All third person shooters have the same concept. Center your camera on the bad guy, aim, shoot. Only adjusting if the aim is slightly off. But here, my goodness! The cursor seems to want to go anywhere, but the target! Although I am newer to PC gaming, even on consoles, I turned off the auto aim. I appreciate the challenge of lining up the shot. Here though, I actually had to turn aim assist on, albeit, the low setting, but still. It was that bad for me. 

Second, NPC aim. So as I try and pop a guy from around the corner, point blank, with a shotgun, two feet away and SOMEHOW MISS!!?! The NPCs on the other hand don't miss a beat! You can actually see their barrels zip to you and boom! This blew my mind! Too many deaths from popping a corner and a shot gunner, or sniper, instantly lays waste. To give an idea of how fast they are, I have two examples. One, this one you can test, if an enemy is about to blind fire you, duck down, but continue to watch his shots. Every shot fired, should have a new destination somewhere in the vicinity around you. But no! Every shot masterfully placed, right above Tommy head. He shot three shots, each shot following the last. Two, as I waited for a bad guy about 15/20 feet away, to turn, and walk away with his profile facing me, I noticed his weapon was at the low ready stance. ""OK, my time to shine"", I thought... I popped the corner to aim, he instantly sees me, raises his gun to shoot, and before he even tries turning to face me, he pulls the trigger, and as I think, ""idiot"", I see his bullet tracer, come out the barrel, at a 90 degree angle! He actually hits, and kills me! To this day, some say you can still hear my F bomb in those decrepit, crumbling, prison walls. True story. But seriously, they could help by reducing the auto aim, because it is there to kill, and you will know it. 

Third, the world. Yes, the world is beautiful! However, this is an older game and you will notice. You have the story, and thats it! there are no side missions, or optional quests to take you around the city. True shame too. I think if this content would have been added, I feel this would have been an extremely welcoming addition. Its a shame Hangar did not take the time to add something like this. Believe me, as you play, you will wish the game left you free, to roam around (I know there is a free roam option on the main menu. I mean built into the campaign) and see the sights, meet the neighborhood, see other stories unfold in your city, on your turf, the ups and downs, of being in the mafia. I would have gladly waited another year for something like this to be added. I get way it wasn't, but still, I cannot help but feel this game could have really benefited from it.

Conclusion
Look, Mafia is ANOTHER game I have caught up on from the past. People are right! It is a beautiful game, with an amazing story, and rich characters to go long with. However, and I know I downplayed this in the review, but I did say, ""clinched fists"" and I meant it. You may run into some graphical, or technical issues.  Constantly reminding you this game doesn't seem quite done. I hate to say it, but this is the second game I have bought from Hangar13 (Mafia3), and both games have their issues. So I do not know if it is 2K, or Hangar themselves rushing these projects out the door, or maybe it is just experience. However, from the detail of this beautiful world, or the sound effects that go along with it, Hangar does have some talent. I am not sure if that talent is held back by terrible decisions, deadlines, or budget, but it feels apparent, Hangar isn't quite there on being a trusted developer. If it were my choice, this package would have included, at least, Mafia1/2, with 2 getting the same treatment as 1. I am not an idiot, I understand the game would have cost more. But both at 60, would have been a heck of a deal! I am not saying this game isn't worth the price, but I can see people beating this game WAY quicker then me. Mafia doesn't give you much reason to pick it up again, unless you love a story rich game, with decent combat. All that being said, Mafia is a good game, one I am happy to have.

21,Mafia Definitive Edition,76686028,english,"A remake with tons of potential, marred by bugs and balance issues.
I love that they redid the graphics from the ground up.
It's immersive and gives you the feel of going back in time.
There are some weird animations and questionable voice acting here and there, but overall, the game is polished up to a believable state.
However, the bugs and balancing issues break that immersion.  Badly.
The race is a big one, and the turret sequence.  Just so impossibly difficult that you are setting the game to easy to hope the RNG gods take pity on you and let you move on.
I hope they make some changes to this to fix these very obvious issues.  The rest of the game seems really great so far.  Mafia II was one of my favorites.

Update: the story mode of this game also has no side missions.  One of the coolest parts of games like this is just riding around, buying weapons, stealing cars, and doing side missions.  This is just the main storyline, one mission after another.  They could have done so much more. 
Ultimately very disappointed, especially because of all the potential here.

Update 2: Toward the end of the game, it gets even worse.  You are put in a situation where you have virtually limitless cops coming at you, though you have limited ammo and ability to heal.  Dozens of them just keep respawning over and over and over again, and if you die, it takes you WAY back several checkpoints before and you have to basically start the whole thing all over again.

They made the game look stunning and feel empty. The fact that its not really open world and everything feels linear is what kills it for me. There are a LOT of QoL upgrades this game needs, especially when this is a full remake and not just a reskin. Whats the point of doing a remake from the ground up if you're going to strip things from the original game out, then add nothing new of note. There's a ton of GLARING missed opportunities here....one's that would have reassured us this studio knows Mafia III was a screwup and not to disappoint again. I'm hoping they don't announce a Mafia II remake because their track record hasn't been great, recently.

After five hours, I'm just not motivated or excited enough to continuing it atm, because it's just....""meh"". I REALLY love mafia themed games and movies, loved Mafia II and was excited to hear this was completely being remade. I just knew they'd add story mode full free roam, clothing stores and gun stores, car dealerships, etc. This was going to be like Modern Warfare's new remaster.....same name but completely new game.

27,Mafia Definitive Edition,76886492,english,"It's one of the best narrative games I've ever played. 
Things I loved:
-The driving is weighty and realistic.  I recommend the simulation option.  The majority of the game is spent driving, so having it require some skill and thought really adds to experience.  Oh and the notorious racing sequence really isn't that hard.  I beat it on my first try.  Don't panic if you make a couple mistakes.  My first 2 laps were garbage, but I was able to come back strong in the third lap.
-The graphics are top notch. Truly some of the best I've seen, not just for being realistic, but also for capturing the essence and vibe of the period the game takes place in.  This game has serious atmosphere and I love it.  The performance was also fairly solid.  It is a bit of a brute to run though.  I settled on capping the fps at 90 with the resolution set to 1440p with high graphics settings running on my 2080Ti.  The fps typically held around 90 with some drops below here and there.  I did experience occasional lengthy stutters, but these were rare and didn't really detract from the overall experience.
-The shooting is simple and fun.  It is pretty similar to games like Uncharted.  Gun shots land with impact and the animations are great.
-The voice acting is 10/10.  All of the characters sound unique and memorable, and the dialogue flows effortlessly and naturally.
-The facial animations are on another level.  Seriously, I think they might even be better than The Last of Us 2.
-The story is nothing groundbreaking, but it is delivered with tons of heart and really keeps pulling you forward.  You care about the characters and want to know what will happen to them.
-It is NOT an open world game.  There's no fluff here.  Sure you can drive around the open city if you want, but there is no reason to.  The game focuses on delivering a tight satisfying narrative and succeeds 100%.  If you are like me, you are getting a little tired of games wearing out their welcome with open world time wasters.

28,Mafia Definitive Edition,76885670,english,"Man, I must say it really hurts to give a negative review for this game, but unfortunately a neutral one isn't possible, so... here it is :)

I was only 15 when I played Mafia. I got the game just exactly when I had to learn for a very important math exam. Conquered the game, failed the exam, don’t regret a thing!
18 years later, played maybe hundreds of games, Mafia still remains the best f***ing ever. It’s the game I still have on my computer since then. I could never delete it. And by today’s storage standards, 2GB are like nothing, so I’ll keep it forever :))

Getting back to 2020, I already played Mafia 2 remake which was nice, but I didn’t have high expectations since Mafia 2 was ok, but nothing like the original.
And for Mafia 1 remake I just wanted to be the original game with better graphics. Nothing more, nothing less.

Now, as I just finished the game, I felt a really big disappointment. 
I played the game at Classic difficulty (which is the hardest, I think). It took me less than 14 hours, spanned in 3 days. Besides some difficult tasks here and there, the game was pretty easy. Remembering how much of a hassle were some missions back in the day, I used to call a friend who played it first, so he could tell me some tricks…

I really miss the way every mission started at Ralphie, teaching you how to steal a new car. He had his special way :D
I miss Lucas Bertone, who also had some missons, but now you see him only once, for the race car mission.
I miss taking the train through the city.
I miss the old missions as they were originally designed. Mafia remake is just a light version of the original game, with better graphics.
Should I say something about the new ugly faces?? But why on earth would you do that? :(
For someone who first plays Mafia, this is still a great game. But for an old player like me, it’s a huge disappointment.",1601596060,1601597702,FALSE,2,0,0.541666687,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,11,1,936,936,854,1601890053

51,Mafia Definitive Edition,76560496,english,"Story Completion review:
Mafia is quite simply one of the best gangster story games around. Forget GTA 5 and playing a total physco, forget strip clubs and playing darts, running here and there to do generic side missions and all the other needless fluff.

This is a focused story driven experience. It's like playing a 3 part movie, you don't live Tommy's life for 100's of hours tedium and all, but you are immersed in the high/lowlights. And that is what makes it good.

I enjoyed every mission. Even when I didn't complete it the first time. Especially when I didn't complete it the first time. The lack of flab and filler makes the story more intense. There's no wondering around doing stuff you don't want to do to put off the final mission, no slowing the pace, no loss of focus, its a constant stream of excellence. Not diluted by the need to try and make it a 100 hour game.

It's an immersive action story game. You feel like you are Tommy. Warts and all. And for me it's the standard of story telling that games should aspire too.

I'd love it to be a bit longer mind. I think there is probably a middle ground between 10 hour story masterpiece and what could be a 10 hour story diluted over 100 hours.

But perhaps, were it longer, it would lose some of that focus, that intensity. And I wouldn't want that.





First impressions review:
No I didn't play the original. I played an loved 3 a few years back, and in my first 2 hours I'm already getting the same vibes.

Whats good? I feel like I'm the central character in a slow burn 3 part mob movie looking into my rise from humble beginnings. I feel like I'm Tommy, the story telling so far is excellent. It's exactly what I wanted.

My only gripe so far would be the gfx are a tad below par. It's a rebuilt old game I never played, but it still looks a bit like a few year old game when you are driving around sometimes. The GFX look slightly better than Mafia 3, but not as good as I'd expect from a new game, but that's not really a hang up for me, if it is for you then just be alert to this.

Otherwise I'm loving this game so far, I'm smiling as I play it. I'm enjoying it.

54,Mafia Definitive Edition,76880569,english,"Mafia: Definitive Edition is the remake of the 2002 original game Mafia: The City of Lost Heaven. Does the remake live up to the original game ? Here's my thoughts.

In short, Mafia: Definitive Edition is a good remake but not a faithful or accurate one. There are aspects of the remake that I liked but others...not so much. The game's strongest point are the visuals, cutscene direction, art direction and voice acting which brings the game into next-gen territory. Mafia: Definitive Edition looks absolutely stunning and really re-creates the 1930s-1940s city of Lost Heaven from the original game back to next-gen glory. The character details, facial animations and motion capture, detailed environments and physics system, car details and models, weather effects and more...they all look excellent with the exception of some NPC faces don't look as detailed as the main characters. 

The audio design is generally alright. Voice actors, dialogues and soundtracks from the original game were all replaced with new casts, new and expanded dialogues and new soundtracks. And while I do miss the original, the new voice acting and soundtracks in general are pretty good and fits with the game's theme and settings. The ambient environmental sounds are also well done. Having said that, if you've played the original and looking for nostalgia, the new voice acting, dialogues and soundtrack might throw you off somewhat. What I absolute do not like is the sound effects of guns which are really muffled. They don't have the same punch, the feel or impact of shooting a gun like the original. To the point where even background soundtracks are more overwhelming / blaring than actual gun sounds.

On the gameplay department, it is above average. Gunplay doesn't really feel very satisfying not only because of the muffled sound effects of guns, but the guns themselves also feel somewhat...underpowered. There's an artificial sway when you aim which will throw you off balance when aiming at enemies. Now I know the main protagonist Tommy Angelo is a taxi driver made gangster but you'd think that all the years of him shooting people, he'd have steady aim eventually but nope. On the other hand, enemies have generally laser-like pinpoint aim, especially on higher difficulty. It doesn't help either that the guns have a short to medium range and enemies are somewhat bullet sponge who will not flinch if you shoot at them except for headshot. So what ends up happening is that you are forced to rush enemies up close while dodging bullets and by the time you try to aim at enemies head while fighting with the artificial sway, enemies will already have taken half your health or worse, kill you straight up. There's just too much shooting in the game which would've been fine if it was actually fun...but it really wasn't all that much. I myself finished the game on the Classic difficulty but you can adjust the difficulty if the game is too hard for you. 

The mission structure is also somewhat changed and expanded from the original game where you have to do certain extra activities in certain ways to complete it. Is it a good thing ? In my opinion, it was alright. I did enjoy the changed pace of each of the missions which kept it fresh and interesting while not deviating too much from the original. I feel that each mission were more involved with more activities and tasks to do in order to complete it, which was good.

The game introduces cover mechanic which works fine but is sometimes a bit finicky in certain places. There's melee combat in the game but it is absolutely dumbed-down where you just mash the melee button while pressing the quick-time-event (QTE) button to dodge and another QTE for finisher. For weapons, you have your classic 1930 varies of melee weapon like baseball bat, knife to pistols, revolvers, shotguns, Tommy gun and a bolt action rifle...all of which you can select before starting a mission (Except for a few). The game also has stealth mechanic but its also kind of dumbed down and somewhat unnecessary.

The enemy AI in the game is serviceable. They will occasionally flank and call out attacks but its nothing to write home about. They felt like fodders or obstacles in the way to getting to the good stuff, being the next bit of the game's story and cutscene which is one of the strongest points. The game's driving mechanic is quite simplified. While driving cars and its handling model do feel they have weight behind it, cars in the game don't have any unique distinct feel or handling mechanic like it did in the original game.

In the remake, the basic story premise remains the same as the original although the layout is changed and somewhat expanded. The story premise takes place in the year of 1930s-1940s era. You are Tommy Angelo, a taxi driver who was on the right place at the wrong time who got mixed up with the crime life of the mafia and things slowly spiral out of control. Does the game's story still feel like the original game ? Sure. The visual fidelity really sells the story and character emotion. As I've said, the story and visuals are the game's strongest point.

The average length of the game is around 15 to 18 hours depending on your playstyle.

And that brings me to my concluding thoughts. As far as remake goes Mafia: Definitive Edition is in general a good remake although it strays just a little too far from the original game in some ways which may not be to your liking, especially if you've played the original. If you're looking for nostalgia of the original game or great gameplay, you'll somewhat get it but will be left wanting. If you're looking for a game with great story and / or want to experience remake version storytelling of the original Mafia game, you'll get that here.

Overall, I give Mafia: Definitive Edition an 8/10. Is it worth buying at full price ? If you have money to spare then sure. If not, buy it at a discount.",1601586029,1601586029,TRUE,14,0,0.685318232,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,1650,24,1095,1095,1095,1601562524

[list]
[*] Graphics;
 They are great. Playing on a 2560 x 1440 display it just looks great.
 Feels like an old game but looks brand new. 
[*] Story;
Captivating and easy to follow. Its all about the story, and with the great job on facial expressions you feel part of the experience.
[*] Gameplay; It feels empty, a lot of great features when it comes to driving but the world is quite empty and its not an ""open world game"" i say that because you only travel in missions, and you are always on a mission. Im not done with the game as of writing this review but it does not seem that the game is meant to be an ""explore it yourself"" kind of deal. 

If you drive over the speed limit you might get caught by the police and can either stop and pay a ticket or drive off. If you stop to pay the ticket nothing happens. This is because there is no money system in game, so you dont loose anything. 
Therefore there is no incentive to drive away and not get a ticket other then that you save some time. 

Early on you get a place to store cars, but as you are never left to roam the world you dont really need a place to store cars. every mission they give you a car that you can use or you can go to your stored cars and pick one of the cars from the previous missions.

[i] Where i am in the story, there is currently no way to customize a car[/i]

The shooting is cover based and works well. 
The driving is great, there are two modes;
""Simulation"" and ""do not pick any other mode""
You can drive it in either manual or automatic. 

There are a [b] lot[/b] of cutscenes and if at times feel like an interactive movie.


[*] optimization;
Running great on an old setup.
2560 x 1440 GTX 1080 = 60 fps
1920 x 1080 GTX 1080 = 100 fps 

[u] I reccomnend this title for the story and not the gameplay itself [/u]

Its a good game on its own, and to think its a remaster of a game that came out in 2002 is astonishing.

Getting into this i had ever played mafia 2 and loved it, and this lacks a bit of that open world feeling. But thats the only complaint i got. 

If the lack of true open world discourages you from getting it, get it on sale. In my eyes its worth the money, and i am very glad im able to experience mafia for the first time like this in 2020.",1601579573,1601579573,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,148,7,617,697,564,1601669151

3,Mafia Definitive Edition,76866282,english,"Mafia: DE is pretty exceptional remake, although I do not know if it is on the same level as Resident Evil 2 as it does have its issues. 
-Positives:
1. The city of Lost Heaven has been remade by hand and it is absolutely beautiful.
2. Graphics are amazing.
3. Characters have been recast, but are pretty great nonetheless. The acting is great for all actors as well. 
4. Driving is much better.
5. You can adjust how realistic you want the game to be, specifically the police reactions as well as vehicles.
6. The game's cut scenes are well directed.
7. Beautiful lighting affects in and outdoors. 
8. The game retains many of the original's missions and characters. 
9. Lots of collectables.

As you can see, I love the game. However, I believe the game has some issues.

1. Combat is the same as Mafia 3. Gunplay is decent, but the melee combat is dreadful.
2. They changed the personalities of the main characters. Characters like Paulie and Sam have turned into loud-mouth assholes and it is hard to connect with these characters (although everyone else is fine).
3. Bit of a shorter game and I could tell that some missions have been removed.
4. Lack of interaction with the game world. I feel like it the world was a step down from Mafia 2 as you couldn't really interact with the world. No interaction with food vendors, gas stations, clothing stores, etc. No new mini games or interaction with public transportation either. Additionally, the NPCs do not seem to have any reactions to you hitting them. It just all seems like Mafia 3 to me.
5. Lack of side-quests. Now, I like a good linear story from time to time, but there really much content in the game other than the main story. I remember the original game having some side-quests (mostly stealing cars), and I wish the devs added a few or even improved on the original ones. Instead, side-quests have been completely removed. 
6. Combat A.I is really dumb sometimes.
7. NPCs in the city is devoid of character and they just seem dull. The NPCs in Mafia 2, and even in the 3 were far more interesting.
8. The game is not very detailed, especially the character's reactions outside of cut scenes. 
9. Some of the charm of the original is gone.

All in all, I believe that Mafia: DE is an excellent remake, but Hangar 13 has repeated many problems featured in Mafia 3. The company has proven that they have lots of talent, especially when it comes to directing video games. However, I feel as if Hangar 13 refuses to go the extra-mile and improve small, but noticeable details within the game. It seems as if the developers are in such a rush to release the game, that they just skip over improving small, but important aspects of any video game. I personally am not excited for Mafia 4, but I can tell you that Mafia: DE does show many of Hangar 13's strengths and weaknesses. 

8.5/10 Would recommend.

18,Mafia Definitive Edition,76862306,english,"Dohrál jsem hru na classic obtížnost a se 100% achievementy, takže se dá říct, že jsem udělal vše, co ve hře udělat šlo. Celkový dojem je celkem rozporuplný. 

Příběh podle mně díky úpravám dává v některých momentech větší smysl a člověk se s postavama více ztotožní, a chápe jejich motivace víc, než v původní hře. Povaha některých charakterů (např. Ralf a Sára) je změněná dost výrazně, což v celku vyznívá taky lépe. Tom už taky není takový připosránek. Některé mise byli změněné, něco bylo přidáno a něco ubráno ale v konečném důsledku to celé dává větší smysl a určitě je to v tomto žárovém odvětví naprostá příběhová špička. Posledních pár misí parádně graduje a atmosféra je hodně hutná a nepříjemná.

Co se hratelnosti týče, tam už hra padá do těžkého podprůměru. Obtížnost classic nemá s klasickou hrou společného nic a je to jen jedna velká frustrace. 99% smrtí nezpůsobí vaše nízké dovednosti ale nefunkční krycí systém a nebo bug.  V původní hře sice protivník kolikrát taky potřeboval 5 zásahů ale cukalo to s ním a nic nemohl dělat. Tady můžete někoho kropit thomsonem a protivník stojí jakoby nic, cáká z něj krev, ale stihne vás při tom ještě trefit 2x brokovnicí. Krycí systém je tragický, automatické krytí vás kolikrát zaklekne na nesmyslné místo, jindy zrušíte krytí, ale postava se na sekundu zasekne a nejde s ní chodit, často z krytu nejde střílet vůbec.  Střelba rovněž katastrofa. Thomson se chová jako kuličkovka, hitboxy jsou na classic taky naprosto mimo. Někdy z metru netrefíte hlavu, jindy thomsnem dáte 5 headshotů po sobě na sto metrů. O animacích házení molotovu raději ani nebudu začínat.

Pokud jste Čech a fanoušek, co jste hrál původní hru xkrát jako já, tak bude dobře fungovat nostalgie, přidaný obsah oceníte a hra vás uspokojí. Věřím, že ale cizinec, který k mafii nemá citové pouto, nebo člověk, co mafii nikdy nehrál, může být dost zklamaný. Celou hru tahá jen skvělí příběh s hezkou grafikou. Hratelnost je příšerná. Jediné co se na ní povedlo je jízdní model aut. Pokud si chcete užít příběh, určitě nehrajte classic. Se skillem to fakt nemá nic společného, jen budete frustrovaní.

Za mně  7/10 ale v hlavě si ještě odečítám bod za chybějící extrémní jízdu.

So this is a review from someone who didn't play the original game but yeah. 
Simply put I really do love this game. There's a lot to love here. I loved Paulie and Sam and feel like you had enough time with them to care enough about them.

The shooting of the game feels just fine. Feels kinda like the Mafia III shooting but it does the job well.

The story was a good enough one. There wasn't some major thing you could grab onto but I'm totally fine with that. Just a guy trying to build himself up in the word.

I did take my time with this game a bit and has some moments where I left the game running while I was afk but the games length still was just fine.

From looking at a bit of the cutscenes and missions I played I feel like this game is a massive improvement to them. Especially with some character deaths  

There was no pointless point boosting shit with same mission after mission to unlock the actual good stuff like in Mafia III. 



There are some missions that felt a bit too linear. I don't mind this for the most part but I just wish the way you played matched it. Like for example the mission where you had to stop Frank and kill him I did it without getting spotted and only killed like 2 or 3 people but the with what Tommy said in the cutscene it still made it seem like I did it by killing everyone. This was just one mission but yeah.

I wish some supporting cast members got more development. We barely saw them. Especially Ralph the car Mechanic. With what he said about Paulie when he walked off I thought something was gonna come from it but nothing ever did.

From looking at some reviews it looks like some content and/or mission were cut so that's never fun.

I do wish there were more changes to difficulty. Like maybe on classic or hard mode enemies don't announce when they're about to throw a molotov 

Lastly I was a bit disappointed to see some stuff reused from Mafia III. With things like blood splatter effects and some animations like when someone gets set on fire.


Not the best review here but ah well, don't give a shit. The game is fun and I loved it. If you've got a fair amount of money to burn then get it but if you ain't sure just wait for a sale.

It seriously hurts me to write this, but i cannot recommend this game for People who played the original Mafia 1. It will be okay for newcomers but they will miss out on what made Mafia 1 special. 

Where should i start?
No Lucas Bertone missions anymore. No tram and railway riding anymore. No free ride extrem. Missions have been cut to make them...easier i guess. Example: The bank robbery in the original Mafia 1 had different stages. You were checking out the bank with Paulie first, then you had to organize a fast escape vehicle and the weapons too. After that, you were able to finally rob the bank. All parts of the plan had to be done manually by the player.
In the Mafia 1 Remake? You start right into the bank robbery. No organizing. No planning. Do i need to say more?

But that is not the only mission which suffers under the ""cutting"". 
The mission layouts themselves have been also simplified. 
Remember when you had to fight and find Morello in the Docks, in the original Mafia 1? The whole area was free to explore. Gangsters were ambushing you and you had to manage your inventory and health. You even had to find out how to get to Morello, who was hiding in the storage hall.
Now in the Remake? It's simply a call of duty shooting corridor with hand holding and mission markers everywhere.




Now let's say something positive too at least:
Mafia 3 wasn't the best game but it had a good and compelling story. This reflects in the changes made to the story and the characters in the Mafia 1 Remake. Hangar 13 implemented new cut scenes and made the important characters more deep. They also changed some story plots to the better IMO. 
They also changed Tommy's speech at the end...i liked the original one more but i guess the new one is good too. 

Graphics are fine too, but i would have preferred the Mafia 2 engine over the Mafia 3 one. 

The music is fine. They made a completely new soundtrack for the remake and it works, although i liked some pieces from the original more. A very nice addition is the radio in the cars tho. There are 2 radio stations and they also report about events that happened in the game...for example the bank robbery. 

tl:dr Mafia 1 Definitive Edition might be interesting for people that never played the original Mafia 1, but i would suggest everyone to buy the original one here on Steam and to play it side by side with the remake. I am overall disappointed with the remake despite it's pro's, but the cut content and hand holding is just not for me.",1601039190,1601555171,FALSE,0,0,0.476190478,42,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,193,29,688,688,688,1601549339

Some characters been changed, their motivations, final monologue - things that greatly contributed to the greatness of the original game. Now it feels more like a glorified Mafia attraction, where developers  felt necessary to put mediocre gun fights and car chases in literally every mission. Apart from unnecessary tampering with the plot, it feels like the developers had very little to offer in terms of their own innovations or fresh ideas. However, for some reason, they felt it necessary to tinker with the plot, turning in from a coherent story with a strong message into some kind of vague rambling about how family matters.

47,Mafia Definitive Edition,76853873,english,"I never got to play any of the original Mafia games that were released back in the day. SO my 'experience' was fresh and unbiased.

Overall the game is great, the story, the combat, the driving and the voice acting. You will find yourself on the edge of your seat in both the combat and the story driven parts of the game. To be honest, at times I felt they should have just straight up made a movie instead of this game and I would have loved it all the same. The scenery is breathtaking with a lot of photogenic moments.

The driving is great, but it doesn't come with any sort of hand holding. You are straight away put into the driver's seat and thrown out to understand how the vehicles work and feel on the road. They have focused quite some on simulating the driving so the vehicles feel weighty and clunky but nothing that would spoil your experience. 

As I am writing the review I haven't finished the story yet but I am almost towards the final chapters and I do have to admit with one thing that kinda felt on the negative side of experience. That being the combat element of the story, the more it progresses, the more it feels like a full blown Hollywood action movie. Very few times you will find yourself being the underdog even if you are a one man army against a 100 men. You will never feel cornered. (Also a lot of explosions)

Not to mention, the execution of the chapters is a bit underwhelming. Well the correct term would be    'cliché'. You can immediately tell what part of the story/chapter you are gonna be having a gun fight in cause there's random med kits and ammunition boxes lying around which have no business being there at that point in the story. On the bright side, the game does a great job of making you care about the protagonist AND the people around them. You feel the connection and the emotional attachment that a lot of story driven games lack in today's time.

SO yeah overall a great game, could use a price cut but since it a re-release from ground up the price is justifiable and I dont mind it.

However in middle of the game i was a bit dissapointet. Ending of the mission ""Happy Birthday"" was kinda cutted. After you sit in the boat you will see time skip and after that Vinni and Sam chasing Sergio. It Doesnt seems right. At lest should be some trip to the bar or at least show as some cutscene. It looks like somebody cut piece of the story. The same goes to the next mission. Ending of the ""You Lucky Bastard"" also feel like cutted. Guys, come on... Whole game is okay, but you failed to make endingfor  2 missions? Weird. 

And ofc Free ride mode. Why we can't go to bus and railway. Hell weird. You add motorcycle, but take away public transportation. And i know that we can go there with some glitch. But it doesnt seems right. And i think you need to add some content on this mode. Because not really a lot of things to do on it right now. Just few tasks from Bertone.

Hope we will see more content soon. Anyways, if you are big fan of old mafia game, then you must buy it. It worth it. I find myself played not stop until I finaly beat the game. It was not so long, but it was nice.

PROS:
- Return to Lost Heaven
- A lot of new details. Now world looks more realistic. Tommy look to the mirror when he drive. Somethimes relax his neck. And even move gear. And a lot more small details, that make game very beutiful
- Motorcycles
- Graphic is nice. City looks very beutiful.

I fondly remember the original Mafia, and I think this is a great remake.

That being said, I feel like it's missing a lot of content. Is it the trains and trams that you can no longer ride, even though NPCs can and are even waiting at (locked-out) elevated stations? Is it free ride mode completely devoid of random gangsters to pick fights with? Is it all those named locations on the map that you never get to visit, even though you feel they've got to be there for a reason? Is it the complete lack of interiors to visit in Freeride, and all the locked gates and visible or invisible walls that prevent you from exploring - or revisiting - a lot of locations on the map? Is it all the cut content that I keep seeing in Youtube videos - additional outfits, cars, drivable boats - that never made it to the game? Go figure. 

I just feel that even for the price I paid, which is significantly lower than an AAA title, I didn't get my money's worth with 27 hours of gameplay, after which I've completed the main story in Classic mode as well as all Freeride quests. I could go after all those collectibles I missed - and there's a shitload of them - but... meh. I might amend my review if the ""Definitive"" part is not so definitive and they add/activate new content through future updates. Hell, I might even amend my review if they introduce a reasonably-priced piece of DLC that's not a buggy mess and/or a shameless cash grab with a reskinned car and a new suit. 

But for now, apart from the occasional drive through Lost Heaven, I unfortunately don't see any reason to return to this game that made me hungry for so much more...",1601519536,1601519536,FALSE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,382,25,1622,1622,1622,1601493100

It was fantastic, through and through, great game; although I can't compare it to the original, I loved the story and gameplay just as much as I did Mafia 2. Tommy is a great protagonist and the game does a great job of building up the Mafia aspect of the game, which is something I didn't see a lot of in Mafia 3.

That mission was a bit rough.

            - Interesting side missions in free ride mode 
            - MOTORCYCLES!

CONS : - slightly overpriced
            - there are some cutscene that tommy suddenly change to his default outfit in some chapters and

            - the gameplay is kinda suck but it's still better than mafia 3

97,Mafia Definitive Edition,76516988,english,"Is it bad? No it's not, but is it really better than the original?

The first scene where you’re introduced to the main characters is nice and action filled and leads into a not so open mission that really want you to trigger the same scripted event multiple times over the span of a short car chase, so much so that it blocks off other routes and ends up making it feel more forced than fluid.

Not the best first impression but luckily it wasn’t going to be like this throughout the game. Some missions are cut down and shortened while others are expanded a little and improved upon. The second mission for example is cut down but is executed better than the original, the fourth mission has been added to a little bit, but some of the later missions are sometimes cut in half and more limited.

The so-called “classic mode” is holding your hand and pointing you in the right direction at any moment, making sure the player doesn't think for themselves. The difficulty options could've been done better, or they could've at least added more customization options to how many HUD or UI elements you would like to see. It’s still very much in your face even on the lowest settings.
And giving the player infinite ammo and auto aim during car chases, on the hardest difficulty of all things doesn’t make any sense.

I'd love to be able to carry more guns like in the original though I can live with only having two guns, the weapon wheel is so terrible and delayed I had to stop using it. I do like that I have a dedicated button for throwables, but for some reason C is always bound to equip your melee weapon so I couldn’t really use it for crouch or cover.

I’ve only encountered two annoying bugs so far, one where most of the audio disappeared and one where a building disappeared and I fell through the ground. I also had an issue where camera movement was choppy and stuttering, other than that the game runs smooth. The game feels a little unpolished and is still haunted by the same broken AI from Mafia 3, so they would have to patch a few things but I think the gameplay is decent even though I wish they would’ve carried over more of the small details from the original. There was a real opportunity to make this a great experience but they decided to cut more features and content than they added.

The game looks good with very nice cinematics and well done cutscenes and the voice acting is pretty good for the most part. I like that we got to know Sarah a bit more, I was hoping the reason for the rest of the changes to the script would make as much sense but that didn’t happen to be the case. The rest of the changes to the characters is throwing everything off and they don’t feel like the same people as in the original.

So is it really better than the original? It looks better, but whether it plays better is debatable and with the so called expanded story I was hoping they would focus on the motivations behind Tommy’s actions, but in the end it seems the writers got confused and didn’t know where to go with the story. This game could’ve been amazing but ended up as a lazy and uninspired remake that doesn’t really add anything of value to the original story.",1601007957,1601516362,FALSE,71,4,0.56083101,21,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,1430,6,733,733,732,1601576490

The art style and attention to detail is tremendous, I wanna leave the game installed so I can just drive around and exist in the world in the joy ride mode.
The characters were great in the original game but I think they did a great job expanding on the characters here and there with a deft touch, that there are no major changes but they feel fleshed out better.
Personally, I really enjoy the gunplay, it feels punchy. And on Classic Difficulty, i felt forced to play a little more strategical which I enjoyed a lot. 
It is overall an incredibly faithful remake. No missions missing. It's at most a slight re-imagining. I can't imagine fans like me having too much to complain about. 


A few gripes;
The game doesn't really communicate to the player that there 12 Phone Booth missions in Joy Ride, which as you progress through the story, if you enter joy ride mode and look around the bar there are notes directing you to phone booths that start side missions.
There's also 5 Lucas Bertone hidden car missions, if you can call them that, plus a few outfits to be found in boxes in the world. I'm seeing a lot of people in thread regarding the game saying they're disappointed there's no side content when there's actually a fair bit. The game just doesn't really tell you.

Playing on keyboard can be finnicky. I had the same problem in Mafia 3, which is Tommy particularly after a cutscene you will be pressing the keys to move and he kinda just stands there or walks in a circle. This isn't helped by the fact the player movement feels sluggish. Sometimes you have to double tap the W key just to get the cars to accelerate. A few missions, particularly the one in which Tommy is being chased, that immediately after the cutscene finishes you're being shot at and Tommy won't move. This meant almost immediate deaths on Classic difficulty for me.

Speaking of Classic difficulty, the race mission is f*cking absurd on this difficulty. My first playthrough on Medium, i think finished the race on my second or third attempt. On Classic, I spent two hours reloading checkpoint over and over until I finally got lucky. It's an incredibly frustrating, in fact I would say a lot of the driving sections can be frustrating in Classic. I would not be surprised if enough people complain about this that a patch is issued.

It may seem like I have more gripes but it's just that I have more to explain with my gripes than how much i absolutely adore this game. I love it.

I played through the original several times back in the day & had not touched Mafia until this remake. The game has stunning visuals and audio/music & Hangar 13 definitely did a terrific job at capturing the atmosphere of the original and bringing it into the modern age. 

There is definitely a slight artistic freedom taken with regards to some of the missions, loose ends of the plot & personality of certain characters. I was a bit skeptical at first but by the end of the game I think they made a good call & it was enough to keep the game fresh and somewhat unexpected for me.

I quite enjoyed the driving, which felt less sluggish than what I remember in the original although I wouldn't have minded if there was more of it ; this remake does strip a fair bit of the joyriding which has a tendency to hasten the game a bit too much for my taste.

If there is one thing I really didn't like about Mafia definitive it would have to be the shooting. I haven't raged so much at a game in a long while...

This game will find 99 ways of killing you & then some more : from Tommy propelling himself in the open onto the complete wrong cover, to self-immolating with a molotov due to how janky the throwing controls are. The AI has wallhacks and aimbots & is able to headshot you with a sawn-off shotgun from 100m across the level & you can expect to instantly die a fair few times to scripted enemies that spawn right around a corner that you were covering against. Expect to have to replay through certain tough sections over and over again because of getting killed within seconds of the checkpoint load until you somehow get lucky enough that all 8 shotguns shots in the first 3 seconds miss you and you get a chance to actually play.

If it weren't for having to reload so many times to unfair deaths during shooting sections or getting completely pumelled before being able to get into a vehicle to escape as part of a mission (I didn't find the race particularly difficult and this was playing in 'Classic mode', you can probably expect 8-10 hours of main campaign with some additional content in free-ride for the bonus vehicles (I've already been through that 'pain' ~18 years ago and probably won't bother this time round).

+ Story was expanded and slightly altered
+ The original czech voiceover was remade and is really good

Just as there're plenty of times when the engine and updated graphics don't look great, it doesn't quite have the same fidelity everywhere, some cutscenes are pre-rendered and look / running worse than the actual game, which breaks immersion somewhat.

34,Mafia Definitive Edition,76832332,english,"I'm on a fence about recommending this game or not. I have to say - I bought this game mostly for nostalgia reasons. The old game is too old, ""barely"" playable in today's standards. The new game brings massively better graphics, improved gameplay, and, most importantly, the same story.

The story is basically identical, with minor details being told differently. It will definitely satisfy you if you want to play the Definitive Version.

Some game mechanics from the old game survive as well. For example, when driving a vehicle, you can press a dedicated button to enable the speed limiter. To heal, you have to find first aid cabinets around the map

However, some things are missing. After you finish the main story, which may take you up to 12 hours, there's nothing else to do unless you wish to collect hidden collectibles around the map. The old game had a ""prototype"" mode, a mode where a player could play a set of challenges to unlock special vehicles not available any other way (prototypes). That mode does not exist in this game.

The game also has minor issues. Driving can feel wonky to the point of frustration. The wonkiness becomes very apparent in missions where you need to escape the cops quickly. Sometimes, the controls won't be very responsive, and the vehicle you're driving might end up hitting avoidable obstacles. Sometimes after dying, the checkpoint will respawn too many enemies, some of which can kill you in seconds after spawning.

as we are unworthy.

An excellent remake of a masterpiece of a game. This is easily 8 or 8.5/10 for me, but then again I have sunk hundreds of hours into the original back in the day so may be a bit biased in either direction. This was the most anticipated game of this year for me, and I'm not disappointed.

Played the whole thing on classic difficulty, all impressions are based on that. It is the difficulty level that I recommend to experience the game fully, it really opens up on classic and gives you something reminiscent of the original. It took me around 35 hours to beat the story, explore around in freeride, find most of the collectibles and beat most sidemissions all on classic difficulty.

If you're interested in details, here's some:

PROS:

The story is legendary by now, it hasn't changed much from the original. The minor changes, slightly different characters are all acceptable at the very least. Not crazy about the voice and performance behind Paulie, sounds a bit clownish to me, and Tommy's appearance might have changed a bit too much. Some of the missions have a few too many of the ""Fast and the furious"" moments. Otherwise nothing for a huge fan of the original to complain about.

The graphics and the style of the game are excellent, looks especially beautiful at night. Animations, models, textures - all massive improvement over Mafia 3 or Mafia 2 remaster.

Car physics - pretty on point. Not as artificial as Mafia 3, not as ridiculous as Mafia 2. Just right. All cars feel different, all feel like vehicles from the era.

Really glad they brought back some of the freeride extreme missions for endgame. Even though not all of them are here and you only get secret cars for a handful of them - don't know why, would it be so hard to replace the costumes you get for completing these missions with a few more wacky cars? Still happy they didn't forget about these altogether.

CONS:

Most of the mechanics are quite decent. Shooting, stealth, cover system - nothing to write home about, but not bad at all. However some mechanics are just unacceptable. The melee combat, firing from the car, the traps on the roads to help you loose the police - all feel terribly arcady, very cheap, completely outdated. You can't control where you aim out of the car, it just locks onto the nearest target, and there's nothing you can do about it. It makes this mechanic feel like something from the PS2 era console shooters. Very frustrating, especially since 18 years ago Mafia pioneered shooting from the vehicle freely before GTA or any other game.

However my biggest complaint is with the level design. All the levels, even though they follow the original ones pretty closely, in general feel more linear, more predictable, scripted, clearly divided into sections. 

In the original you had multiple ways of beating many of the missions. Some levels were mini-sandboxes with the amount of freedom similar to the original Hitman game Even though, in fairness, most people probably only went down the most obvious route, in the original I have played each mission a couple of dozen times, studying every nook and cranny, experimenting with multiple, sometimes completely ridiculous ways of beating the game - like killing the prosecutor on the boat by beating him to death with a bucket.

In the remake, however, there's always only one way of doing things, everything is frustratingly scripted and linear. You might want to go back and replay some of the missions for the dramatic and epic moments, but not for experimentation and freedom because there are none here.

For me these are the two very regrettable negatives of this game - not the minor changes in the story or layout of the city, but the fact that 20 years later we have better graphics, but took a considerable step back in terms of mechanics, interactivity and freedom. Regardless it's an excellent game, be sure to pick it up, whether you played the original or not you're probably gonna enjoy it.

44,Mafia Definitive Edition,76615358,english,"This review is going to sound pretty negative, because I'm going to compare this game to the classic masterpiece from 2002. However, I do recommend the experience as a whole.

This remake has changed many aspects from the original game, and most of them are worse; sometimes even much worse.
- The story is generally the same, but this time, the presentation feels much more like a generic movie. Some of the changes can absolutely ruin the atmosphere (especially the cutscenes in ""The Death of Art"") and even certain gameplay sections.
- The same goes for most of the characters. Tommy and Don Salieri are decent, but the new Tommy seems less realistic and likeable than the original, and the rest feels uninspired.
- The music (both orchestral and licensed) sticks out far less and has a weaker ""personality"". The rap/hip-hop (?) song at the beginning of the credits is awful.
- The gameplay obviously feels better than the janky classic, but the level design for all the missions is too linear and feels less natural. It is also heavily scripted.
- The countryside has been changed from large, colorful, open fields and dense forests with green, red, and yellow trees to a rather boring bunch of rocky mountains with some grass and green trees. This also affects the motel, the race track, and the airport. It's still okay, though.
- Lucas Bertone's side missions and the Free Ride Extreme mode are both missing. Instead, you can visit Lucas in regular Free Ride and unlock 5 secret bonus cars from there. There are also additional side missions that you can find by following instructions that appear in the Bar.
- Some locations are in different places and have been redesigned, which can feel a bit uncanny and maybe sad to old fans.

Overall, despite all this, the Definitive Edition (which is a stupid name) is still solid. If you haven't played the original game (which you should do), or if you're an old fan who can manage to look at this game as its own thing, it's fun to play and exciting to experience.
It took me about 10 hours to finish the story on Classic difficulty (without aim assist), and I will probably unlock all the side content and achievements. The frame rate could be a bit higher, but the game runs well enough and Lost Heaven looks great. It feels nice to see such a beautiful new version of this city.

PROS
+Great story that takes the original and makes it more fun to play through due to a far greater script than the original.
+Memorable characters that make every death and betrayal sting.
+The city is great representation of 1930's America and creates a wonderful atmosphere.
+The radio Stations are very immersive featuring adverts and music that actually were released in real life,
+Cars have a lot of weight to them which makes them feel like real machines as opposed to plastic on wheels (GTA V etc).
+Great performances from the cast (Especially the actor for Tommy).
+Soundtrack is very well done and sound like something you would expect from a mob related piece of media.
+Animations look mostly nice (Reload animations, gear shifting animations in cars etc).
+Shooting mechanics felt robust (I liked how not every shot was pinpoint accurate which makes sense seeing as Tommy isn't a marksman).
+THAT racing mission.

CONS
-Open world is dead with nothing to do (I understand this is how it was done in the original as well but it wouldn't have killed them to add in some side missions or make the open world more 'alive').
-Story is too short (They should've added in some more main missions or side missions, once again I understand this is only because of the original game being short but they really should've done more to increase the duration people spend on the game, giving us better value for our money).
-Bugs and glitches (This includes infinite loading screens, crashes, awkward animations and sometimes characters not speaking when they should be doing so. Although it should be noted these were rare and my experience was mostly smooth)

Overall despite having a short story and a sorta dull but very atmospheric world, Mafia: Definitive Edition includes a great cast of characters that includes an even greater story, a fantastic and immersive soundtrack as well as fun gameplay.

This is a game everyone should pick up regardless of whether you're an old fan or a new one.

+ Game kept it's linearity, most missions are pretty much the same, cars look pretty much identical, indoor areas are recreated quite faithfully to the original, the street layout not so much but the city does feel a bit more alive with far less ""empty"" spaces
+ 90-95% faithful recreation of the original bringing back great memories (bits and pieces of the music that tries to avoid copyright)... but the missing 5-10% are pretty glaring for someone like me for whom Mafia was love at first sight all those 18 (damn...) years ago

neutral: Driving... built for city chases through drifting pretty much, at times it worked, other times it felt somewhat over the top

- Police... police AI in the original was iconic, they would notice traffic violations (speeding/red lights. etc. while driving on the sidewalk narowly mising pedestrians was 100% fine) and they would react accordingly to the situation, avoiding police after they went into ""manhunt"" mode was not nearly as easy, while now a speeding ticket bothers the cops about as much as mass murder of officers and they will give up too quickly (also who the hell came up with the idea of pedestrians/drivers calling in accidents or reckless driving reports, cellphones must have been  quitepopular those 80 years ago... probably the guy who programmed dogs to report crimes in GTAV)
- The Race: Almost identical feel of frustration as in the original (pre-patch) achieved through horrible driving ""simulation"" of the racecars which is quite different from regular cars that behave a lot better
- and last but not least is my biggest issue of them all, but that one is quite...
SPOILER-y
In the original Tommy is on a great moral crossroad [spoiler] whether he is doing the right thing because after all, he did mess up big time and the Salieri's family is upholding the Omerta (the code), while he was always acting as if he was above it, this means he only comes to det. Norman because he knows he messed up and will be met with a Lupara and you are left with the feeling - ""you kinda deserve it buddy""
While in the remake the dillema just wasn't there, they made Salieri break the Omerta himself by getting involved in running drugs, which clearly puts him and Sam as the ""bad guys"" and you come out as the guy who won over the bad bad mafia [/spoiler]

Mafia 1 DE is a great game. It is not as excellent as the original however.
I only played the original in its original czech dabbing and localization, where the voice acting is just perfect and the story and lines were written for it. I only saw very few clips of the english version of Mafia and the whole atmosphere was a lot worse because of the way they voice acted it. I have a feeling that the DE writers only knew the english version, despite a lot of czechs working on it. Because the most powerful thing about Mafia 1 orig is almost completely absent in the DE. This is due to the voice acting (voice acting is great, but they the way they deliver their lines has a lot less weight to it) but also the changed they made to the characters themselves. Mafia 1 Original had in my opinion more realistic, heavy and well delivered characters. The other thing the original was way better at was thee soundtrack. DE soundtrack is authentic, but way less atmospheric and disctinctive. It took away from a lot of the atmosphere the original had. There are also some cases of lazy writing and skipping important parts of some missions, but overall its very well made. The rest of the DE is just amazing. The animations are just top notch, the graphics are mostly truly beautiful (except for things being way too shiny generally and a lot of texture repetition to be easily seen on all ground surfaces. The fact that many textures are literally just DLed from textures.com and plugged into the engine is kinda fine. It allows the art to move much faster and make it possible to deliver such a great game for just 35 pounds. I personally wish this game cost 50 pounds but had all these things polished up.

So. Mafia 1 orig is my most favourite game of all times, making a DE of it is therefore nearly impossible task. That and all else considered, this is a fantastic DE and no brainer to buy.

71,Mafia Definitive Edition,76823396,english,"It's a pretty good remake, and I'm very happy that it has been done. 
Here's my first impressions after finishing the game. 

[h1] Pros [/h1]
[b] The visuals: [/b] Lost Heaven has never looked so beautiful. It's a masterpiece both from an art directional and a technical point of view. 
[b] The voice acting: [/b] The voice acting in the original game was very good for its time, but it doesn't live up to today's standards. While I'm not entirely happy with the direction they took for certain characters, the voice actors did a great job. 
[b] The radio: [/b]  The radio lived up to the standard set by it's predecessors. It really captured the feeling of the era. 
[b] The racing mission [/b] Although it was a nightmare on classic mode, it was a masterpiece. The commentator was amazing, and the game really felt like a 1930's racing sim for a while. 
[b] The cutscenes: [/b] Generally superb, especially the postgame cutscene for [spoiler] Creme de la Creme. [/spoiler] Masterfully done.

Cons: 
[b] The gunplay: [/b] Despite promises of the contrary, the combat system is exactly like Mafia III. You're essentially playing as a slightly paler and more well dressed Lincoln Clay. Even some of the guns are directly (and anachronistically) imported from Mafia III. 

[b] The lack of mundane details: [/b] One of the things that made the original Mafia great was the attention to detail. If you car ran out of gas, you had to go to the gas station and pay the attendant to fill it up. If you were caught running a red light, the police gave you a fine. If you were to lazy to drive, or just wanted to take a scenic tour of the city, you could take the tram or the train. Neither of those are available in the remake. 

[spoiler][b] The ""Election Campaign"" mission: [/b] They completely ruined my favorite mission from the original game. The original mission both had some intense close combat inside the abandoned prison, but also a great sniping event in the story. The remake still includes a one shot, one kill sniping event, but aside from that it was a buggy mess, completely devoid of any fun combat. I had to replay the mission several times, since the door opening levers were buggy as hell. 
Overall I really didn't enjoy any of the 1938 missions in the game, which is rather sad, since the previous levels held I really high quality in general. [/spoiler]

[b] The stealth system: [/b] It's awkward, and really feels out of place. Also, you're never given a choice as to use stealth, it's forced upon you, and it always ends with a cutscene when an alarm goes of, which kinda the idea of playing it stealthily. [spoiler] Visiting rich people [/spoiler] is a great example of that. 

[b] The police: [/b] Despite promises of the contrary, it's still as bad as in Mafia III, even on classical mode. Although it will fine you if you commit some minor crimes, such as speeding. 

[b] More narration, less sandbox [/b] The game does a great job trying to tell a story, with cutscenes and scripted events, but it removes some of the sandbox elements that made the original great. The lack of side-quest severely limits replayability.

[b] The soundtrack: [/b] The original had one of the most iconic video game scores of all time, both the original orchestral soundtrack, and the licensed songs provided a unique atmosphere in the game. The Django Reinhardt songs were especially iconic, and everyone I know who have played the game, instantly associates his music with Mafia. 
The original soundtrack in the remake is a bit generic and uninspired. It's a nice craft, but it's not the masterpiece that was the original soundtrack.",1601488663,1601489708,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,369,30,2056,2056,1902,1601558164

Mafia: Definitive Edition is one of the most realistic and sharp looking games out there. The remake is truly impressive. Although it bears some resemblance to the GTA franchise, it is nothing like it. The remake is rather different from the original in the sense that a lot of things have changed, not just graphically speaking. The story mode is basically missions back to back with little freedom to really explore the world unless you wanna forget about your objective and do raise hell everywhere. But if that's your goal, then you have the free ride mode available as another game mode. Driving i would say is the best experience in this game. It feels so satisfying and beautiful seeing those old cars on the road. The driving mechanics themselves are surprisingly really accurate for cars of that time. The combat experience is similar to what you would see in Mafia 3, nothing special about it but it's alright i would say.

         I am really enjoying the game, the mechanics are not as fluid as GTA Vs. Naturally the game is also not as free and in depth at GTA V. However, this game shines with the driving. It feels like Mafia 2s driving, but the shooting is definitely all Mafia 3. The graphics are drop dead gorgeous during cinematics and cut scenes, but buildings from far away look like a PS2 render. Its a bit silly how it looks like NEXT GEN during cut scenes, but looks like a PS3 game in some areas. 

A Cinematic Review:
         The Mafia story feels like an original story regarding organized crime. While some of the acting is not stellar, some characters really have their moments. If you are a fan of the ""Mafia genre"", and get a thrill out of those dramatic films and TV, then this game might just be for you! There are better stories about the Mafia sure, but this one really pulls you in with the graphics and paramount importance of ""loyality"". My only issue with the story (A minor problem) is that there are many voices in the game that attempt a ""New York Italian accent"" which results in 7 people sounding the exact sam.

While the graphics and voice acting are on par with any well-made 2020 game, many other mechanics have not aged well. Driving and the cover-shooting system feel wonky - but that's expected in a remake of an old classic, and I wouldn't have faulted the game for that. What did caught me off guard, though, was that even its famed story was actually quite lackluster in my opinion.

The game's storytelling suffers from the old issue of disconnecting the character from gameplay. Tommy can go from murdering hordes of nameless dudes to refusing to murder one more because ""conscience."" In 2007 it might not have been such a big issue, but now it is hard to see past. 

The story pacing is also weird and incomplete in a few places.
(Story spoilers)

Tommy's embrace of the mafia lifestyle was so amazingly fast that it cancels whatever conflict or remorse the game wants me to feel about it; His fallout with Don Salieri was way too rushed - and without ever showing how Salieri reacted to the situation; The bank heist job feels rushed and unplanned. (Even Arthur Morgan had to do way more planning to rob a bank in 1899, and now in 1938 two guys can just walk in and do it? And the police knew how to seal off all exits in 1899, but in 1938 they forgot how to do it.) And it is simply OOC for Tommy - so far depicted as a cool-under-pressure, brain AND brawl kinda guy - to be convinced so easily into going against the Don just because he caught the Don lying once. And for all the game's emphasis on ""family,"" we spend precious little time with Tommy's family. Important events in his personal life that would have delivered the story with way more punch - his wedding, birth of his daughter etc. - are skipped over. 

(spoiler ends)

I can see how these were not so serious back in 2007, before crime games such as Red Dead or GTA took crime in games to a new level, before story-driven action games like Uncharted 2 pushed forward the question of whether a character's behavior matches the gameplay, before other high-quality RPGs like Witcher 3 and The Last of Us showed us how deep we can explore the protagonists' personal side. But this is 2020, and the problems that might have once seemed tame are now glaring. 

Don't approach this game expecting a full 2020-level experience even for the story (or 2015, for that matter). This is a game that was modernized only in its graphics and voice acting, but not in its storytelling or mission design.",1601484506,1601484506,FALSE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,231,7,786,786,786,1601426475

having played and loved the original when I was kid I bought this straight away and completed it twice, once on normal difficulty then again on classic and absolutely loved it, their are some things that could be improved like the A.I in my opinion but this is the best remastered game I've ever played.

I just hope if Hangar 13 decides to makes another Mafia game that it lives up to how good or maybe even better to this one and not be repetitive and boring like I found mafia 3 to be.

Voice acting is A+ and I love the voice actor for Tommy, he's got such an addicting voice to listen to. Its got this light raspiness at just the right depth that makes him so unique. 

The gameplay is split between around 65% driving and 35% combat and I'm all for it since driving in this game is really fun. I recommend choosing simulation mode for driving because its a more realistic experience that feels nicer in terms of control. Combat is mediocre, not bad but not great either. It gets the job done.

It took me about 13 hours to finish this game which is good. You don't want the story to be too short but you don't want the story to drag on either.

Mafia: Definitive Edition is a game developed by Hangar 13 and published by 2K and is a remake to the classic 2002 game; Mafia

I can safely say that Hangar 13 have faithfully recreated Mafia into a modern-day remake and do a superb job with it. It's not perfect, but Hangar 13 clearly show that they care for the licence, story, characters and what Mafia, Mafia

The game offers some really nice graphics, although some ugly textures and glitches here and there, it is pleasant all the same

Mafia: Definitive Edtion overall, however, is a fun game to play, and it does get boring if being played for a long time, but is a very good action game and to play in short bursts and should be played by anyone who has played the 2002 original or loves the Mafia trilogy such as myself

32,Mafia Definitive Edition,76807488,english,"Mafia: Definitive Edition. A game developed by Hanger 13 and published by 2K.

I have been obsessed with gang based games and movies for as long as i can remember, Sitting down as a kid and getting lost in the Godfather movies, or Scarface or playing the classic GTA games that eventually lead into the classic made man scenarios were so immersive and intense that it felt like you were there and a part of it. The drama and the intrigue of it all was tantalising, So when the first Mafia game dropped in 2002, I was excited to say the least. Finally a game that grabbed a new perspective that gave you the chance to play as a made man. So you can imagine my extended elation when i heard that the Mafia trilogy was getting a rework, 2 and 3 receiving a few loving tucks to tidy them, but the original getting a complete remastering. Words can do it justice. But i'll try my best.

Story: 8/10
Nostalgia. Nostalgia will pay a huge part in this review for me, as i tenderly stroke my memories of playing this for the first time i'll try and remember this is the remaster and try and be as unbiased as possible. Mafia Definitive Edition, takes place in the city of Lost Heaven. You begin as Tommy Angelo, a cabbie just living his day to day life, trying to support himself until he is suprisingly thrust into the life of a Made Man by meeting his two accomplices, Paulie and Sam. The story untangles from there as the 3 of you begin to take on jobs and the gang rivalry becomes apparent between your Don, Salieri and an opposing Don Morello. Not alot of what happens in this game is beyond cliche, If you've watch any Mafia movie, really any at all you would be familiar with the developments of the game, Very rarely will it trick you into false security or lull you into not realising what is going to happen next. But i think the simplicity of the story here is what helps the story narrate itself, It feels like the classic Mafia drama unfolding, but you are in the drivers seat..Literally and figuratively.

Gameplay: 8/10
+ Gunplay: Anyone who is/was familiar with Mafia, knew that the game was brutal. BRUTAL..Horrendously and unfairly punishing for the impatient. Thankfully the combat, mainly the gun play here has been significantly revamped, It feels alot smoother and easier to land those careful shots as well as giving you adequate warning when you're taking too much fire. 
+ Map: The map in Mafia DE is awesome, Perhaps not the greatest of all games in terms of detail, but it points where you need to go without being confusing or overly littered with useless information.
+ Driving: The driving, probably the bread and butter here as well Tommy was a cab driver, He starts off in a car and is very rarely far from one, I guess to give you a little more control over the events, You can make the driving skippable but you miss alot of the banter and discussion that occurs during those drives and i feel like thats a waste. I would like to mention that despite the driving being amazing, the Race at least on classic difficulty is Hell. Ask any Mafia fan they will tell you the same.
+ Character development: Not many games pull of the character development, of both the character you play as, and the characters you are around, Mafia does this well, I had thought perhaps the remaster would lose some of its charm, but it has remained intact throughout this experience. My only tip is spend as much time as you can listening to people chatter it really fleshes out the world.
+ Difficulty: Its rare to find a game that balances the difficulty levels well. Mafia DE does. It makes easy feel like its more story based and Classic feels like it focuses alot on precision and tactics. Whether you like challenge or a cake walk this game will have a setting for you.
- Movement: The overall movement in Mafia DE, despite being smoother than the original can still feel extremely clunky, I like that they have added a stealth mechanic to make you feel like a shoot out isn't always necessary, but overall running around the hallways or tight spaces of most buildings can feel extremely cumbersome.
- Death animations: In the event you die, *On classic difficulty this will happen frequently* the death sequences can last a minute at times, falling or rolling and listening to the enemies talk about how they kill you is entertaining maybe the first 2 or 3 times but after that it becomes more a slow burn and becomes grating. I want to get into the fight again and show them pain but i can't because i'm still rolling down 4 flights of stairs.
-/+ Game Length: A $70 AUD game for 12...ish hours of gameplay (Non completionist), doesn't feel like a worthwhile trade off and normally wouldn't push me to a purchase. And not many games offer such a low length for such a high price. I think this game borderlines too expensive for its length but if you're a fan of the series, and want to play through the Trilogy, the price isn't that bad. Plus owners of the originals got the 2nd and 3rd Definitive for Free. or you could buy the Definitive trilogy pack for cheaper. Hard to argue with that value.

Visuals: 9/10
Mafia back in 2002 was a visual masterpiece, it was probably at the console peak of graphical power. Mafia DE probably isn't at that calibre for 2020, but that shouldn't be a negative, because its not. Its highly optimised and it'll run on most mid range PC's on high settings and some low end PCs at Medium. This game is truly a labour of love, An intricately re-detailed game that focuses on maintaining the grit and the charm of the original but also adding the purity and clarity of the current generation. Hanger 13 have put the effort in here and it shines through in every scene. It has no graphical issues such as tearing or glitching during my time playing and ran at a steady 85 frames on mid level PC on Ultra.

Audio: 8/10
The audio here is what you can imagine, Staying true to the original almost flawlessly the game keeps its class and adds a new level to it in nearly every aspect. An up-tuned amount of sound quality here was without a doubt on the cards, but the overall quality level has improved significantly, Alot of the original sounds updated entirely while others have just been re-recorded to have a more pleasant response. The voice acting has stayed strong and i can't really tell if its the original that has had a touch up or if its completely re-recorded entirely. Either way a stupendous effort in bringing the sounds of Lost Heaven back to life.

Overall: 8/10
Mafia Definitive Edition is an absolute testament to a well designed game. From the story to the graphics it has always been a staple for the PS2 generation, Now it's a testament for the next generation and a new staple for them. This game has been masterfully re-worked and redesigned to provide Mafia in a fresh light and does so phenomenally. This is an experience that if you're unfamiliar with Mafia, you need to, As soon as you can, and if you loved the original this version will bring you nothing but joy, just as it has with me.
Despite it's length and rather high price at the moment, i believe this game is worth the cost. Even if this is the only part of the trilogy you have to purchase. A must place for fans of the game, or fans of the genre alike.

+ Graphically amazing, one of the nicest looking games I have played in years.
+ Audio, and Score is good, Voice acting is really on point too!
+ Game actually has a decent story, (but more on that later)
+ Get to hear famous Gangster sayings like ""Take care of it"" & ""Hows your mother""
+ Character's actually have personalities.
+ Gun-play is really satisfying, the gun models look great.
+ I'm not a car guy, but the Cars in the game look beautiful.
+ Game plays a lot like a Movie, there's ALOT of cutscenes which all look fantastic, but a good few hours feel like cutscenes. 

- Driving a T-REX would be easier than the cars in this game.
- The Ending of the game makes Game of Throne's ending look good.
- Free-play is really pointless and Boring.. Once you've finished the story you'll likely never play again. 
- It Feels a little rushed in some places, No Public Transport, Only 5 Guns, Some really interesting characters are only on screen for 20 seconds etc.

What i think is crap is mostly this:

1. Car driving. the orignal is way better even considering its age overperforms this S H I T but it is better then M3 but 200 times worse then M2

2. Sound in general no complains but very far from impressing. But driving throu a water splash drowns your engine sound making it hard to know your car now thats not the only Ex. of bad sound config just one of many.

3. Free roam is not here its a strait single player story telling you exactly what to do. Not a problem for some but for me.

4. kinda obvious considering nmbr 3 but all Maffia games had this problem. So i finnished game cruising down town and got absolutly NOTHING to do.

Now I'm an Game Developer,,,, because of game like Mafia, Doom, GTA, Wolfenstein,,,,Gothic,,,, I loved video game world etc.

About definitive... It wasn't what I was thinking at the start.... Graphics was awful on first sight, shooting was strange,,, and running mission ` really poor animation... But after 2 or 3 hours playing, I catched myself on the idea that I like this...I love the athmosphere....
Now, I can say that this game, was the best blockbuster I played for a long time, and I'm sure that I will play it again. And yea,,, I gonna call my elder brother tomorrow, and give him a try......

This game did a really good job it's a rework just like re 2 remake. Everything look very perfect and very addicted.But there were some bugs I found was some npc got flashing like laggy standing there also suddenly appear in front of me?? Other than that game still working fine. 

Hope the new patch fix these bugs

Third review:This game had some glitches as I mentioned it before...now I playing more and more I realized some cutsense got no sounds literally.
PRO: u can [press Q]SKIP DRIVING
CON: some people can't accept it(spoiler)

LAST REVIEW&CONCLUSION
I finished this game last night and felt so great. I didn't know Tommy was killed by mafia 2 main character...so I think mafia 2 has somewhat connected the story in mafia 1. It was a long time ago I played it. Probably forgot what is up the story in mafia 2.

Conclusion:So basically this company done a really good job for mafia 1 remaster .I heard they even reworks all cutsense for the original. The camera angle, faces expression and add on new cutsense(if I'm not mistaken)etc...

Hangar 13 did an excellent job capturing the spirit of the original Mafia while simultaneously updating the writing and atmosphere for an altogether more modern and immersive experience. The core design philosophy of Mafia is still here through its linear story and lean side offerings which is honestly refreshing to see again in a game in 2020. Before the era of endless checklists and filler side content to pad game runtimes, open worlds were backdrops against which the story unfolded, not overbearing weights that eclipse the story itself. This is essential for newcomers to understand before going into the game. Mafia is not ""1930s GTA""; it is its own unique franchise with a different style of game design so temper your expectations.  

Technically speaking, the game is wonderful. Never before have I seen the art deco era so wonderfully realized in digital form. At night with rain falling, Lost Heaven really feels like an authentic glimpse into America's Great Depression past.  I found the gameplay enjoyable all around with a fair mix of driving and shooting. The cars feel appropriately weighty for their time, and the game really captures the thrill of the classic ""cops and robbers"" car chase from gangster cinema. The guns likewise feel pretty devastating which is all the more amplified by the death animations and scripting that make the last gasps of a man riddled with Tommy gun rounds leave much more of an impact than a simple ragdoll.  

At the competitive price of $40, I think this is a no-brainer buy for fans of linear, single-player storytelling. While the tale of brotherhood and betrayal in classic American gangland is a familiar one, never before has it been so well executed in the video game medium.",1601445457,1601445457,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,278,21,909,909,834,1601789581

+ Its not remastered its a whole new game
+ Gun play is great and fluid with cover systems
+ Vibrant city that feels alive 
+ Option to skip the drive to the mission point
+ Story is like watching a proper mafia film the characters grow on you

Cons 

- Some of the driving missions are tedious and annoying FYI I beat the racing mission my 2nd go so I dont get whats so hard just take your time theres no rush...
- The story is strictly linear sure there's a few open ways to play out missions but its nothing like mafia 2 or 3 or any open world game, some people might like this but I feel it lacks freedom.  
- Free ride is open world but its very boring, there's really nothing of worth to do just drive and find collectables? no thanks.

Ideas

> Add taxi driving, mob fights and maybe hit man style missions in free ride? 
> Because I love the gunplay so much a pvp multiplayer mode would be amazing

86,Mafia Definitive Edition,76787022,english,"This is a great remake. Very faithful to the original (it really hit me with nostalgia at times!) but it expands and fleshes out a lot of the characters, and adds some extra parts between the classic scenes.

Optimisation is stellar, I had no trouble hitting 80-100+fps on Max settings on my rig, which is 100x better than Mafia 3 was. (that had a 30hz fps lock at launch!) This runs and looks better than Mafia 3 in every way. One caveat is that you need to switch to Borderless Fullscreen for the game to run at 144hz. Fullscreen defaults to 60hz which has tons of screen-tearing, feels laggy, and none of the fixes I tried worked. 

Controls are fully customizable and hot-swapping works. I played mostly with an Xbox One pad but switched to M+KB when Io needed more accuracy. Shooting and overall game control are almost identical to Mafia 3, which I personally enjoyed. Driving on the 'normal' mode feels snappy and fun, while the 'simulation' mode makes the old 1930's cars handle like boats.

I didn't encounter a single bug, crash or game-breaking error throughout the whole playthrough, so GG developers.

Graphically one of the best looking games in recent memory. The cars and environments look stunningly detailed, and the use of screen-space reflections are the best I've ever seen. It genuinely looks like ray tracing at times, they're [b]that[/b] good.

The overall story is almost identical to the original, with brand new character performances, given much more life than the original game. The new cast is great and memorable. It took around 11 hours for me to finish the story, so it's short, but they've also added a lot of collectables throughout the world, and some cool side-missions and hidden vehicles in Free Ride.

This is the definitive Mafia game. For fans of the original, fans of the newer entries in the series, or complete newcomers, there's a lot to like here.

A great short but tight story.

The gameplay on the other end is average as average can be. Do not expect the depth of open world systems offered by one of rockstars titles here, the open world is strictly pretty looking scenery without much to do outside of the story.

99,Mafia Definitive Edition,76792483,english,"Just My Two Cents :

First and foremost, I had played Mafia II and Mafia III prior to playing Mafia: Definitive Edition. While I found most of the game enjoyable, there could've been things that were added to put this re-master ""over the top"".

In terms of the visuals, they looked great. I think they could've worked on the facial expressions a bit better than they did. Lost Heaven seemed lively enough and I enjoyed running around in it. 

Game play mechanics didn't seem to be on Hangar 13's list of improvements. It would've been a better experience overall had they mordenized them. For example, I was running away from the enemy AI in one mission and tossed a molotov cocktail behind me, over the shoulder. Based of other review sources, the mechanics were also in issue. In addition, the weapon reticle is a large circle and made it hard to make head shots. Enemy AI was okay besides that fact it seemed you had to unload a bunch of rounds to bring one of them down. Even then, the death animations were below average.

The story is good, but not captivating. It is a linear, story-focused game, which I didn't mind. I'd just wished maybe they could've added or polished some of the missions with this reincarnation. While the missions were good, they were not GREAT. I mentioned facial expressions earlier and for me personally, this was one of the reasons I think the story really didn't get a grip on me. Besides Paulie, most of the characters in Mafia : Definitive Edition seemed bland. The game is so short, that it is hard to invest any feelings into any of them besides a select few.

In the end, I tried to be as honest with this review as I could. I'd recommend this game to those that haven't played the original Mafia. But for those that have, I would tell them to wait on a sale. I hope that this helps anyone looking to purchase Mafia: Definitive Edition.",1601432962,1601432962,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,272,3,553,553,553,1601360550

Some of the negative reviews on here are people that are unable to get the game to launch, and haven't done the basics like updating graphics cards and general maintenance.  The other one is that this game is linear and not Open World; while the campaign is a linear story, the game has the Free Ride mode which opens up the city for exploration and collectible hunting.

As for the game, I was immediately pulled back into 2002 while I was sitting in front of my new Dell Desktop computer after I left Best Buy with a brand new game.  It was a choice between GTA3 and this other game called Mafia.  I played that game until 2pm the next day before I passed out.  Since then, I have played those three disks over and over.  This game is so amazing down to every little detail.

What blew me out of the water was the fact that Chicago accents help set this city separate from Empire Bay (Originally Mafia was set in New York/New Jersey that Empire Bay is set in now) and that the city redesign added 1000% more immersion into the game.  Playing the game I have the missions memorized, but they added additional little twists or other details and they trimmed down what used to be just basic driving missions by updating the destinations or just allowing you to skip non-essential driving entirely.  If I had to point out something that was a flaw it would be the cover mechanic and how sometimes it throws you onto the wrong side of an object if you're close to a corner when you hit CTRL.

Mafia Definitive Edition is something we all should have saw coming shortly after Mafia III and Mafia II got definitive edition releases. Well, its 2020 and we just got the Mafia Definitive Edition. So a few questions come to mind: Is it just as good as I remember? What did they change? but mainly, Is it worth it? Today lets discuss and review Hanger 13’s Mafia Definitive Edition – The good, the bad and the changes.

29,Mafia Definitive Edition,76787559,english,"Mafia is a great game. It has great graphics, realistic character animations and a compelling story line. 

If you've played the original game than this is a very nice way of re-playing the best game of the Mafia series (imho). If you haven't played the game than you'll be surprised how well this game is made while the original dates back to 2002. But be warned; don't expect to be wandering in an open world or play with modern game mechanics. The shooting and controls still feel a little dated and clunky.  In that area you'll notice that the original game is already from 2002.

The game has no replayability. Although you can collect some cards, magazine and other stuff. It's not that interesting you'll want to play the story again for.

Currently the game costs about 40 EUR / DOLLAR. In my opinion this is a bit steep. Pick this game up on sale if you've played the original and if you haven't make sure you pay around 30 for it.

The story holds up and, TO ME (this is highly subjective) what little was added to it was built upon expertly and not just tossed in for the sake of padding. It looks gorgeous. While we've all seen better looking games, the art style goes a long way to compensate the small complaints you could have about the graphics. Sounds very well without being great. And it played great in classical difficulty, the movement and shooting may be a little on the stiff side but they're very very faithful to the original and have their old-school charm. I experienced less than 10 glitches in my entire playthrough and never a crash of any sorts. I got a regular 2060, a Ryzen 5 2600X, 16 gigs of DDR4 2666 MHZ and the game is installed on an ssd m2 nvme.

34,Mafia Definitive Edition,76786833,english,"Overall a good game, and a worthy remake of the first one. Some minor details have been changed in some missions. Some for the better but others for the worst. There is a bit more ""run away from the cops before they drain your truck health meter"" than i would like. The dreaded race is there and its hard as usual but the mission you have to run away from the cops while shooting from the back of the truck is really the worst in the entire game, expecialy if you are playing in classic mode, which you would want to. The 1911 ant the thompson feel a bit weak. Unless you score a headshot, you are to expect to get 4 or 5 shots on the enemy before they go. Seems like 45 ACP is more like 25 ACP. I dont remember in the original if it was like this though. The rifles are more deadly though. Driving physics are spot on for this type of game,  its easy to control the cars, and enjoyable as you slide around the corners and this clever counter steering gives you that extra help when you are driving with the keyboard. 
Unfortunately the lucas bertone missions are not really implemented as the original. You get introduced to the guy but all he as to offer are some 5 posters with locations for special cars which you have to go and find on the world. Also there isn´t really time to go there between missions, as after you finish one you are already starting another. You can go and visit luca before driving back to salieri or just exit and enter free ride mode to collect the cars.  This small details arent anything but quirks and only when comparing with the original.

36,Mafia Definitive Edition,76786615,english,"Firstly on classic you have to shoot people so many times it reminds me of what Australia found about about Emus; ""If we had a military division with the bullet-carrying capacity of these birds it would face any army in the world... They can face machine guns with the invulnerability of tanks. They are like Zulus whom even dum-dum bullets could not stop.”... its laughable.

I was a huge fan of the first game. it caught me at an young age where the prospect of driving around a city enamored me with a love of driving.  I actually considered becoming a billionaire just to remake this game I enjoyed it so much.   Well... looks like I need to keep considering that option.

While I do recommend this game, because it is visually pretty cool and really has no competition in the 1930s genre of games if you are a fan of the first game please note that many of the most endearing aspects of the game are gone.

The challenge is now a highly arbitrary feeling cover shooter, with Emu level enemies who you plaster in bullets but then kill you after you empty magazine after another into them. So fun and engaging....  Nothing like linear hand holding missions.

The music doesn't feel period correct, a lot of it comes across as 1940s-50s which makes me feel like I'm playing Mafia 2.  Not saying they had to license Bing Crosby's ""Brother Can You Spare a Dime""... but I mean the essential sounds of Django are long gone.  Central Island without the blaring sound of Belleville playing over and over just doesn't feel the same.   The ambience just isn't there, and certainly not just the Django...

Which leads me to scenery as my next gripe.; while it is nicely(ish) rendered, it feels so... generic...  Mafia 1 looked like a bunch of Czech people looked at period accurate WPA and CCC posters of the United States and based the visuals off that.  Which came off very well and really created pretty genuine impression of depression era America.  For example the country side in the original had that quintessential vignette feeling of ""America in the 1930s"".  The country side now looks like an ugly combination of West Virginia and Southern California boosted from GTA V.

 Not enough traffic lights which detracts from some of the visual wow factor and hardly any phone booths. Why 1930s Lost Heaven has LESS phone booths than 1950s Empire Bay... more carrier pigeons?

As widely mentioned and panned the new takes on the story are lame and lack depth, the voice acting is subpar and sounds like people who watched 15 minutes of Goodfellas, not even the whole damn movie.  Its just less adult sounding.  Maybe they needed to find life long chain smokers to get voices that sounded more period accurate.   That Lucas Bertone and Ralph are pretty much cursory hand waves as the central focus of driving has been reduced generally it seems.

I admit I have some detailed gripes, but personally I loved the getting lost in the game feeling of the first Mafia that this doesn't come close to touching.

For my laundry list of nit picks and outright hostile feelings, it is a fun game.  It is worth buying and playing, and the more its done the more we can hope for patches and mods to make this closer to the whole experience aspect of the first game.

39,Mafia Definitive Edition,76786413,english,"Hangar 13 should be praised for developing such an impressively faithful remake. Every cutscene has been painstakingly recreated for the modern era to make the narrative shine while supporting characters, such as Tommy's love interest, have been expanded upon to provide more depth. The iconic race is back and better than ever, and yes, the traditionally frustrating mission just before it is much more manageable this time around. That along with a whole host of other memorable sequences will make series fanatics feel right at home. This is absolutely the Mafia you remember

The remake made some small changes to Lost Heaven, but they're purely an option that can be selected at the beginning of a 15-hour playthrough. The police force isn't nearly as aggressive once they give chase, a number of different collectibles can be found in each and every corner to flesh out the world, and new difficulty modes let you fine-tune the experience. Again, though, they're simply offered as a choice rather than the new way to play the game.

And as for the visuals, they can be both impressive and inadequate at the same time. Character models, particularly in cutscenes, look outstanding and so too do some environments, but introduce some greenery on the outskirts of the city and texture pop-in can be replicated on demand. Although, considering we’re working with a city layout nearly two decades old, it can be forgiven to a point. Bugs and glitches can’t be though as cars find themselves suspended in mid-air the moment you turn your back while the frame rate drops dramatically during intense combat sections.

It pays a great deal of respect to the source text with excellent cutscene direction, voice acting, and a cast of characters you can't help but fall in love with. The game definitely shows its age with frustrating controls and vehicle handling, but the next story beat is enough of an excuse to continue pressing forward. Mafia: Definitive Edition's narrative and everything that comes with it holds up to this day, and it's one worth revisiting even if you know it like the back of your hand.

3- Terrific cast of characters
4- Great cutscene direction and voice acting
5- Iconic missions get a new lease of life

44,Mafia Definitive Edition,76566144,english,"My biggest issue with the game is the Melee system. If they knew that there were going to be several missions that are focused on melee why did they not spend time creating a semi decent melee system? The original game does it way better. You can actually aim your baseball bat in the original which was great for beating u cars, which leads me to the second biggest issue: 

The car damage models suck. The Original game had far more complex damage models for games. Wheels would wobble, the 3D mesh of the car was infinitely dynamically deformable, cars would overheat, leak fuel, wheel would pop off from gun shots, etc.

This game looks and sounds better but that is not impressive to me in this day and age. This game has made the gameplay of the original worse in every possible way and they have neutered the story by changing important plot points and beats and removing essential elements from the game's story. I could honestly write essays on why this game is not as good as the original and why you should not pay full price for it, and I have already written and produced two videos explaining my opinion before the game was released.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHXgui3OsYs&t=60s

I enjoy seeing the world and characters in the Next Gen format and if you are happy to spend money on a short unfulfilling gameplay experience in favour of a mediocre cinematic experience then buy it. If you are looking for an actual good game with new features and interesting dynamic gameplay then don't buy it or wait for a sale.

I'm very happy that they included freeride. I really appreciate the effort to include cars like the Crazy Horse even though it's not as crazy as the original car. I would give this game a positive review if it was half the price. It's a great game it's just not worth the price.

Another MASSIVE issue with the game is that you can't reload specific checkpoints, only the beginning of chapters. In the original game you could return to any checkpoint in the story at any time. I find it extremely frustrating when, for example, I am on the airport mission and I bypass the guards and I reach a checkpoint and unable to go back to the previous checkpoint to see if there is another way to get past the guards, or on the ""trip to the country mission' where they have added about 4 extra checkpoints with no health-packs in between, so if you want to retry from the previous 3 checkpoints to gain health you HAVE TO START THE ENTIRE MISSION OVER!!  this is ridiculous, please change this, it reduces the replayability and the recordablity of this game dramatically. Video makers have to replay entire missions just to get to specific scenes

Honestly, the removal of all traffic lights from the city is the most cowardly way of saying ""we give up trying to program traffic laws"". 

Classic difficulty is more difficult than the original not because of better AI or realistic damage but because the combat system is less precise. It is no longer possible to crouch and aim simultaneously. The game forces you to rely on the cover system which jerks the camera around and sometimes places you into vulnerable situations you would not normally decide to put yourself in.

Going down a right-handed staircase? You are screwed. There is no way to put the camera over your left shoulder without hacking it using cover

Getting a weird bug in the game where the Crazy Horse runs out of fuel during the alien mission and it reloads the checkpoint with no fuel, even though it incorrectly states that there is fuel. Upon filling up the car it stopped working completely, the car no longer accelerates at all. Will check back later.

The more missions I play the more I dislike this game. They have removed any option for the player to be clever by removing all alternative ways of finishing the missions. this game is ridiculously restrictive compared to the first one. They completely screwed up visiting rich people, the party, and the docks by changing them from free form level design where you make your own choices to a linear series of events that you have no control over.

Edit: after many hours I've changed my mind. This is the biggest COULD BE masterpiece ever. Had they possibly spend less time remastering the entire franchise and spending tons of money on artwork and textures. They could have easily made the ""next GTA"" 
UNFORTUNATELY 
The Hangar 13 devs clearly think that GTA isn't cool and they don't wana copy. And somehow linear is better than free roam. I mean yea, theres a free roam mode... But if you have to make a ""free ride"" mode to let people have some sort of unscripted fun... Then you've got a fundamental problem with the game, especially with a map this size.
Also theres tons of collider bugs, way worse than graphical bugs. Enemies will shoot through walls, cars, windows. Sometimes windows won't break ect ect.

Being a big fan of the first Mafia, I was waiting for this remake ever since I've heard of it. I got to say I'm pleased with the results. Sure, there are some bugs, but when I played original Mafia it also had lots of them. 

Definitive Edition looks pretty good, shooting has been modernised to match today's games and the city feels more ""alive"". Classic difficulty is similar to the original (mainly because of dying really fast during the gunfights if you are careless). 

They've added some cutscenes, modified old ones and personally, I like this change. It didn't affect the main plot, as it is still the same one we all fell in love back in 2002. 

If I had to point something I don't like it will be the new voice acting. Especially for Paulie. I don't like his new voice and I don't like his new look.

Mafia tells the story of Thomas Angelo a cab driver that smokes a cigaret while waiting for his next customer on one of his night shifts. As two men approach him holding him at gunpoint and order him to drive to escape some rival mobsters, that night was Tommy's first step into another life.

Gameplay wise Mafia does nothing too special it's a solid shooter with some weird driving physics, while the game is open world there isn't much to do in it, you go from mission to mission instantly not like in GTA for example where you got a lot side activities to do the only thing are collectibles but yeah who likes collectibles *cough*

The atmosphere and the storytelling in this game are still awesome it's been 18 years since the last time I played Mafia and the Definitive Edition does a great job to enhance the game I loved back then even further.

75,Mafia Definitive Edition,76769376,english,"Sometimes I wish that Steam had a feature for something in between Yes or No in terms of reviews, because it will be perfect for this game. If you never played the original Mafia, you may find that you like and enjoy this game a lot, on the other hand if you’ve played the original back in the day, you may have an issue with a lot of things.

Let me start by actually saying that I’m quite surprised that Mafia: Definite Edition currently holds a score of 86% positive reviews on Steam, I for sure thought that it will be more divisive than that. 

With that out of the way, let’s do a little backstory. Mafia was released back in 2002 by a Czech studio called Illusion Softworks, a time in video game history in which games were already starting to push the boundaries of what is really possible in the digital world. Mafia still managed to stand out due to its strong reliance on realism, great story and memorable characters. I still stand by my opinion that the original Mafia was one of the best games I’ve ever played in the last decade. I had the pleasure of playing it on release date (and a couple more times since then) and was fully blown away by the experience.

Fast forward to earlier this year, 2K announced that they are fully remaking the first game. The development was led by Hangar 13, which were responsible for the shitfest that was Mafia III and “former devs that actually worked on the original title”. I was understandably cautious, but in the end, I thought that Mafia was a great game and it will take a lot of effort to fully fuck it up, worst case scenario the story will at least still hold up. And while that is true, the game is not even close to the state in which Mafia III was released, something was still missing.

I had trouble getting immersed in it, I had trouble caring for the characters or the story points which I loved so much. It just felt like a chore at some point, there was no atmosphere it just feels like you are doing mission after mission without any reward or any visible character development. Some of the visual updates for the characters were horrendous, I still can’t get over how they massacred Paulie, in the remake he looks like a Goodfellas version of Doug Butabi. Some of the plot points that were changed don’t make any sense, it feels like they are added just so they can prolong the story. The main character is also completely butchered in my opinion, he doesn’t seem to care at all about what is happening around him. In the original game you were really feeling like you are Tommy, a regular guy in the wrong place, in the remake it seems like he was born to be a mobster. This takes away a lot from the experience, because one of the parts that made the original so unique was how the main character was deployed into this dark, dark world that he was just not ready for.

The gameplay part also feels a little bit weak, it just seems incredibly arcade-y at some points. While I admit that the original was not perfect gameplay wise when it came out, it was still something fresh and unique. You may say that the remake is more technologically advanced so it makes sense for it to be different, but when Mafia was originally released the title was also pushing the limits of technology in many ways and still that did not affect the gameplay portion at all. I was playing on Classic difficulty and yet the game was still forcing auto aim on me in some missions, which I found very frustrating. I’m willing to give it a little bit of a pass here though, because this was always going to be one of the hardest things to recreate in the remake.

It’s not all bad, some of the new character models were really good (Salieri, Sarah, Frank, Morello), they also managed to fully remake Lost Heaven and the city looks beautiful and incredibly detailed. This unfortunately is when my other huge gripe with the game comes in. It sucks that you cannot freely explore the city while you are doing the missions, there were several moments in which I saw a landmark that I recognize from the original game, so I decided to check it out more closely only to be met with a message that said “You have 10 seconds to return to your objective”. I know there is a “Free Mode” in which you can do whatever you like, I just think the game would’ve benefitted from a more open approach and a few additional side missions. It just sucks because they managed to recreate a memorable environment.

I’m also a little bit pissed in regards to the soundtrack, some of the most recognizable and popular tracks are gone from the remake. The iconic Belleville by Django Reinhardt was removed because the game takes place in the 30s, while the song came out in ’46 (which is an incredibly stupid reason). Another thing I noticed was also that when you complete the game on a Classic difficulty you are met with an…. Ice Cube song in the credits. I mean what the hell is going on, I thought that it was a joke at first, but it kept going for 4 minutes before the original Mafia theme kicked in, who thought this is a good idea?

I started the game on Friday, managed to finish it on Saturday, it took me 12 hours and I decided to sit on this review for a couple of days, just so I can fully form my opinion. The game is nowhere near what it should be, but it’s an improvement over the previous Hangar 13 title, maybe with how well this game is doing, it will guarantee that they will get a chance to develop Mafia 4. Unfortunately, the franchise seems to be rapidly moving away from what really made it great and I don’t have high hopes for any future titles.",1601396150,1601413047,FALSE,10,0,0.621733189,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,853,17,751,751,751,1601162189

The best thing about this game is it's city... it takes the spotlight. Lost Heaven oozes with atmosphere. What better period and place to set up a Mafia game than 1930's Chicago? The city is filled with all kind of buildings, ads and cars that really make you feel like in you're in that time period. At night the city lights up from all the neons on the buildings. I'm tellin' ya... it's a sight to behold. The feel of this city really reminds me in a way of Vice City. It looks nothing like Vice City, but it's atmospheric and beautiful just like Vice City was when I first played through it in 2002.

The 2nd best thing in this game are the cars. The designs and the driving are incredible. The way the light reflects on cars during the day, night and during rains... PERFECT. And I was pleasantly surprised to see motorcycles in this game. You don't see a lot of motorcycles in these GTA type of open world games. And they also drive insanely great... although a bit difficult at times.

The gunfights and cover mechanics are ported from Mafia 3 (which from my POV were not bad) with small changes (in a good way). From all the weapons I got to use, I really enjoyed Revolvers. They really have weight to them when shooting enemies.

The bad part of this game is the fact that it's so damn short. The Devs really just remade the old story without adding too much extra stuff in it... which is kinda disappointed cause I really wanted some extra stuff to do besides the main story. Some extra stuff that exists in the game, but not in the main playthrough. They added a new mode in the menu called Free Ride where you basically enter the map without the main story in which you can do 11 side missions (you go to a phone booth, you pick up a mission and execute it) and collect cars and collectibles. I will never understood why they split this from the main playthrough. Other than this I have no other complaints.

Bugs? A few funny ones but nothing game breaking.

Performance... incredible. I ran the game on highest graphic setting possible with 1080 resolution on a i7 processor, 16gb of Ram, SSD and a GTX 1060. The FPS was between 50-55 with occasionally spikes of 60fps. Through my whole playthrough I didn't encounter a single crash... which is a rare thing nowadays at launch day.

Difficulty - I recommend normal.

Overall - A masterpiece. Five stars ***** I highly recommend it.",1601410999,1601410999,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,158,15,1064,1064,698,1601726745

Had a blast. Driving cars are actually fun in this game compared to the original. The storytelling is mostly great, although the ending did feel a bit rushed. Gun play is meh. You better go for the head shot cause the enemies are bullet sponges. Character movement can feel unresponsive on occasions. Specially right after a cut scene, if you try to move too early, Tommy will just stand still)

My biggest gripe however is with performance and stability. The game crashed on me on multiple occasions. The graphics are mostly good, but also nothing to get too excited about.  Despite that, the performance was pretty disappointing. My 1080ti dropped under 60fps very often. There was also a ton of hitching (ran it from the hard drive, maybe ssd would fair better?).

97,Mafia Definitive Edition,76778526,english,"I guess we should all admit, that Hangar 13 did put a lot of their effort in this ""remake"", but however in their true fashion they just weren't able to make a proper game without screwing up a lot of things. 

Probably thieir worst mistake is their decision to keep mafia 3's animations. And i'm not only refering to shooting that I'm personally okay with, but like animations used by other NPC's. Just the way they react when you point a gun at them, their IDLE stance and the way they get in and out of cars look awful. It really ruins the immersion.

Now I want to say that they did good job with the envoirment, the city looks fantastic, but once again for some reason they had to do something weird for no particular reason. First of all, why did they got rid of many alleyways within the city? I was driving for like 2 hours and I had only discovered 4 enterable alleways that you can drive trough. For some reason there's a lot of them blocked by gates and other invulnerable barriers that prevents you from entering them, altough you can clearly see on the map that there is an area behind the gates. And I also dislike how they completley redesigned ""Hoboken"", witch they also decided to rename (Probably to avoid confusion with NY hoboken). As you may remember in the original mafia it was like a propper poor neighborhood of 1930's with rusty appartament blocks, wooden fences and paint comming off them. But however in the remake it looks like a typical near downtown area in some typical metropolitan city. So basically they just decided to completley ruin this unique part of city and remade it into some another generic part of town that is not unique in any way.

And I also would like to mention that Hangar 13 devs do not know a lot of stuff about period authentic firearms. Can someone please inform them that cops in 1930's did not carry a 44 cal. mangums with them, 99% of police officers back then carried .38 S&W or colt revolvers. I'm pointing this out because the original mafia had it right. Cops in the original mafia only carried a .38 cal. revolvers like they're supposed to. And since we're on this topic, they also don't know that colt 1911 IS NOT a double action pistol. You need to cock the hammer before firing this gun. I just find it very irritating always seing the hammer in non-cocked position while firing the damnn gun, like how hard it would be to just make it right? And oh yeah, the slide also doesent go back after you spend all your rounds, seriously these guys's firearms knowlege is just garbage.

I would really like to know, why did they decided to make the public transport unaccesible... As you can recall, in the original mafia, you could ride a trolley and a subway. I mean, yeah, nobody really used them, because they're slow in there's no reason to ride them when you can just steal any car instead, but nobody uses subway in GTA 5 either, but it still there and you can use it if you want to. Hangar 13 is lazy as s**t. 

I also dislike the game's narrative, but it's the matter of taste. However you can't deny the fact that they went over their heads to make the game funnier than it really should be with placing some akward childish jokes whereever they could. Like c'mon this is the game about gangsters in 1930's THIS STUFF IS JUST OUT OF PLACE HERE. Just compare it with mafia 2 where you were laughing from hearing F-words every couple of seconds with drunk Paulie who sing about what cows and chickens say. Like WTF is this? 

So basically, this game COMPLETLEY FAILS as a remake of the original mafia, but somewhat succedes as a 2020 game about gangsters. If hangar 13 will be making mafia 4, I'm defenetly not buying it.

The game is pretty stable overall, could have been a bit smoother maybe. Didn't encounter any major issues like blockers or crashes. Had a few bugs here and there but nothing very serious.

Indeed it is a game reworked from the ground up and it really looks like the developers put their heart into it. 

I would have liked to see more side missions added to the game though. More customization features and interaction with the city.

Played the original, back when it came out, then once again maybe two years later. Haven't touched it since.

[h1]Review[/h1]

This is what I want from a remaster/remake of a game I haven't played in at least 15 years. It feels like the game I remember and for me that's the most important part. The atmosphere, the store beats, the moments are the same as I remember. The FEELS. 

This is from someone who had Mafia as a memory, I can see how if you played it more recently, the new voice acting and models could be jarring, but frankly the discount-Joe Pesci Paulie was always a little too on the nose for me.

It still has the weird Mafia quirks, this is an open world game, sort of. Its basically quite a strict mission based game but you can drive to the missions the way you want. I'd advise driving too, the world is beautiful, and turn the cops to enforcing everything, it makes it way more atmospheric when you have to drive a terrible car at 40.

Now please, please, please give me Hidden and Dangerous!

14,Mafia Definitive Edition,76775305,english," This game can be described with 2 words, WASTED POTENTIAL. I Was very hyped for this game but It seemed rushed and unfinished which gave me a very disappointing experience.

-ANIMATION AND MOVEMENT : Probably the biggest problem of the game. motion is immensely awkward and seems unpolished. Vaulting, running, jumping down, entering cars, Throwing molotovs, melee combat, shooting all of these animations are not in sync and looks very stiff and unnatural. 

-GRAPHICS: graphics are great but not that great. the lighting is a bit off sometimes. So far I had no optimization problems.

-CONTROLS: garbage. Sometimes I cant run and sometimes I can so I end up jogging in a fierce shootout taking a buttload of damage , movement is inconvenient and frustrating.

-BUGS: The game has countless irritating bugs, Ex) enemies glitching and teleporting from one place to another, phasing throgh walls, bushes destroying cars, civilians randomly warping in front of your car, npc cars just start randomly spinning and crash into you during missions

-CONTENT: No open world, no money system, shops, side missions, extra content and inappreciable freedom. 
Also weapon stock and selection is just 
                    
-CONTENT:  ZERO interaction with the world. Cant enter buildings, an empty map with nothing to explore , the city is basically just a damn ghost town with tall buildings. No point in exploration

-AI: AI is on the verge of being braindead. Ex) enemies stand in the open waiting for you to open fire ( Hard difficulty) , cops cannot chase you for more than 30 seconds, npcs dont know how to cross roads,

- CAMERA: The camera is ridiculous.It stutters and sometimes cant keep up with me. whenever I do a stealth attack it just zooms into an empty blank space where i can only hear the attack.

- GAMEPLAY: The gameplay is tedious and repetitive after a few hours. There is no variety in missions Its just the same thing, driving from one place to another- mindless shootout- car chase - shootout - car chase, repeat.

-GAMEPLAY: Generic 3rd person shooter with broken cover system and dull shooting. Feels very weak and unoriginal. 

-STORY: The story is quite good but seems much more face paced and linear. Voice acting was good and the atmosphere during cutscenes were amazing. 

-SOUNDTRACK: Although the musical composition is great they use the same soundtrack for almost every damn mission.

Conclusion: I was a big fan of the mafia series since I was a kid and highly anticipated this remake. However, I became very bored and underwhelmed halfway through my playthrough and the only thing that kept me to the end were the visuals and the story.  No replayability, Stiff and awkward movement, lack of content, empty and boring map, braindead AI, repetitive and outdated gameplay which overall made the game feel extremely rushed and unfinished. Not worth the full price.

Cons compared to the original:
- Shorter. Took me 12 hours to complete the story. And I'm the guy who walks when there's no reason to run, 
   role-playing a true mobster.
- No car thefts for Lucas Bertone. I didn't mind since they weren't my favorite missions but still.
- Some bugs.
    *Graphics clipping.
    *Saw a police car just spinning around for no reason.
    * Had to restart a checkpoint two times because a character or a car got stuck in the environment.
- And the greatest weakness compared to the original: Gunplay.
    * Reloading is a lot faster than in the original.
    * There is no sound when magazines drop on the ground. Might seem like a small thing but you know 
       what I'm talking about if you've played the original.

Pros compared to the original:
- Pretty much everything else.
    *Cars seem to handle like big heavy chunks of steel on tiny wheels like they are.

The story was fleshed out and characters were given more interesting backgrounds. New Salieri is also much better. One thing I don't like is that the locations are locked off in freeride, you can't visit the giant cup cafe or hotel. I would also appreciate some additional story DLC (Paulie's adventures, or family life, racketeering, bootlegging DLC, Salieri's rise to power or anything like that). The traffic after 1935 is a bit unrealistic, as there's a lot of Culver Airmasters and the old cars like Model T, B and V8 are very uncommon.

24,Mafia Definitive Edition,76774495,english,"Never played the original Mafia, so obviously don't have any nostalgia for it. 
Having said that, I thoroughly enjoyed this game. 
It's an extremely well-acted, action-packed experience with great visuals.
There are problems however. Mainly, a lack of activities in Lost Heaven outside of the main storyline, lack of variety of music/radio stations, as presented in Mafia 2, and various cliches common for any italian-american gangster movie. 
I understand that the developers didn't want to change the vision of Illusion Softworks, not to mention the fact that the original game is nearly two decades old, so obviously some dated aspects of the script will arise. 
This might be a comment that has been repeated way to often, but this game feels like a classic movie that you can actually play which is both good and sometimes can be quite limiting to the experience overall.
What I mean is that although the gameplay and cutscenes are intertwined quite seamlessly, you never get a feel that you can have any significant impact on the plot, it is kind of set in stone and all you can do is what the game wants you to. 
All in all, this was a pleasant experience, even though it definitely has dated aspects.

35,Mafia Definitive Edition,76772966,english,"I haven't had a game this fun in a while. I love the Mafia series and I'm glad 2K gave Hangar 13 another shot at it after the polarizing reception of III.

I've had a bit of a dabble on the classic version of Mafia but didn't quite make it far long before I played the remake or II. I did watch some videos of the classic version and it's a solid game for it's story and gameplay, though some things can really be mundane and tedious like the driving and some combat section.

Mafia: DE is definitely a step in the right direction after H13 learned from their mistakes through Mafia III. For one, they made the remake more story-driven instead of a grindy outpost takedown ordeal like MIII where they basically copied the Ubisoft open-world formula. I actually stuck to playing MDE for extended periods of time whereas I could only play MIII for an hour or even less before I'd take a break. The story is immersive and definitely fleshes out the characters well. They gave them a personality and development which definitely makes you love or hate them more.

Now, this might not be for everyone either but I also like how they toned down the monotony of driving back and forth from place to place. In the classic version, you'd often spend at least 10-30 minutes driving to important destinations but in the remake, that time is cut to 2-5 minutes, with the option to skip them as long as they aren't chase missions or other important things.

For gameplay, it plays basically the same as MIII except Tommy isn't as nimble or strong as Lincoln. He's capable of doing brutal finishers, stealth takedowns, and melee combat. I'd also say Tom isn't as strong as Vito either, since he can't knock out enemies with the 3 punch combo like Vito could in II when engaging in firefights. The shoulder switching is really useful for peeking around corners where enemies could be hiding, considering in Mafia Classic, you had to slowly peer your way without any sort of tactical movement like leaning. The one complaint I have, though, is that they gave the enemies more health than III or II. Usually, in those games, it'd take like 2-3 pistol shots or 4-5 machine gun shots to kill enemies, but in MDE, it takes 4-5 pistol shots and 10 machine gun shots to take them out instead. There's also a bit of weird balancing too. Enemies can sometimes kill you in 2-3 shots with the revolver at 80% health or 1 shot with the rifle on Medium. It's pretty ridiculous. They can tank a bunch of shots like it's nothing, yet Tom just gets shredded in fewer shots. One other thing (not necessarily a complaint) is that enemies will actually stop shooting/attacking you while doing a melee finisher on their comrades. It's really funny how they will stop to watch their friend get beaten up before they go back to trying to kill you too. The health cabinets from Classic (not the difficulty) return and replenish about 75% of your health. Health and ammunition boxes are indicated on the map for you on difficulties lower than Classic/Hard(?). There's also a soft health-regen system where if you're below 20% health, you will have about 3-5 seconds to not get shot again to regenerate. I don't mind it, considering in the Classic version, you'd be starved for health a lot and you could be going through missions with like less than 10 health and have to make every shot count. 

I don't really have much to criticize for this game. I thoroughly enjoyed it and it was a blast to play. I would play through it again, but as with others, I'm stuck on a specific mission on Classic difficulty which is also notorious for being difficult in the 2002 version, and can't be bothered to spend hours playing through what's basically insubstantial to the big picture of the story, as I could be spending that same time doing productive things or playing other games. Maybe I'll come back to it whenever H13 rebalances it or adds the option to skip that specific section.

38,Mafia Definitive Edition,76563522,english,"I have loved the Mafia series since when I first played it around 2004-2005. It was a time when 3D GTA games were becoming a huge deal and they pretty much set the standard. Then there was Mafia. The one game that was something else.

Mafia was a totally unique game. Let's compare it to a GTA game from that era in gaming. No GTA had police that would try to arrest you for speeding or running red lights. No GTA had side missions that gave you cool extra cars. No GTA had as much interaction with NPCs as Mafia did. The setting, the story, everything was very special. Obviously, the game was rough around the edges. That is the reason why Mafia: Definitive Edition exists.

What does this game have that I found so cool back in the day? The setting is still the same, the cars are still the same (this time even with motorbikes!) and the characters are - though much deeper - still the same. The police system is still similar, though I guess it's a bit more forgiving in this one. The story wasn't changed too much and I think that's a good thing considering what this game is supposed to be: a definitive edition of Mafia.

Many things were changed though. The protagonist's personality seems a lot different. In the original game, Tommy suffered from guilt all the time. It was a large part of him as a character. He was a lot softer, meanwhile in this game, he seems to be a lot colder. Just look at his melee combat. Tommy has no problems with being brutal. Friendly relationships also seem less important in this game. In the original game, the objective pushed you towards helping out Lucas Bertone while, in this game, it's very easy to forget he even exists. Also, Ralph doesn't give you cars at the start of every mission. The whole car thing was changed a lot. No more does Tommy say that he doesn't know how to get into cars. He just smashes the window and jacks it. Both Ralph and Bertone seem almost pointless now. Same thing with Vincenzo, to be honest. You can just take whatever you want. A lot of the casual conversations from the original game are no more. That was a large part of the original experience. It was almost like a simulator experience back in the day.

On the hardest difficulty with simulation driving, I finished the game in roughly 13 hours. Mind you, the race took me an hour and 20 minutes to finish. A lot of it was down to luck and A.I. behaviour. Another large reason for the game taking that long is the same thing you encounter in Mafia II and Mafia III: forced snail-pace walking. Frankly, I disliked that in those games and in this one as well. It was very frustrating in indoor spaces.

A large question about this game is whether or not there is a free ride option. Yes, there is. However, Free Ride Extreme doesn't exist per se, but the regular free ride does have similar missions where you can get cars, outfits, guns et cetera. The system has been changed a lot from the previous game, so go to Salieri's bar to find out more! Sadly, though, the original iconic Free Ride Extreme missions are gone, so there is not gonna be chasing Speedy Gonzales in this game.

I think the most important question with this game is this: considering the fact it is a definitive edition, does the game improve every aspect that felt bad in the original game? My personal opinion is that it doesn't. Frankly, it takes a lot of the original experience away. It felt like the same story but transferred to a game that felt a lot more like a GTA clone than the original game. Like playing Grand Theft Auto V set in the 1930s.

I did like the game, don't get me wrong, but as someone that loved the experience that the original game offered - not counting obvious nostalgia value (I recently replayed the original game and it indeed has its faults) - I feel like this game just stripped a lot of the unique qualities and left you with the original story and enhanced graphics. At least on those two fronts, the game is indeed a ""definitive edition"". Therefore, I would rather recommend going for the original game. Still, I do recommend giving this game a try if you like the idea of the original game but want a modern version of it.

-There's some discrepancies between the remaster and the original I don't like, such as removing driving to and from objectives in a few missions. Driving around the city is really pleasant so I wouldn't have minded more of that
-I encountered an ultimately harmless but weird bug in creme de la creme where after the last cutscene in the mission it said I died (wtf lol?) and pressing ""load last checkpoint"" fixed it
-First mission feels too unrealistic compared to the original version
-I can't confirm this as I haven't tried it myself but apparently the alternative Morello death is gone, if this is true then that's pretty sad

+Throwables are actually used in the remaster, they were barely used in the original
+Several sections have been expanded in meaningful ways compared to the original
+Graphics are gorgeous
+The new character models are really nice looking and most stay true to the original
+More scenes with Sarah makes the story make more sense
+Customizable difficulty, I played on hard all the way through except in that damn racing mission
+Collectibles of various kinds
+There is some level of the city feeling alive, unsure how it compares to the original as it's been ages since I played the original. In one mission you can see a bunch of protesters and in another the bridge is closed due to a car accident. 
+The audio is much better compared to the original I feel like

64,Mafia Definitive Edition,76768311,english,"[h1]Not quite THE Definitive Edition, still a very good remake [/h1]

Pretty much as anybody else growing up with Mafia I was both delighted and anxious upon hearing that there will be a remake of the first Mafia with upgraded graphics, extended missions and a completely new cast with other nips and tucks here and there.

At first, I was impressed by the graphics but wary that the new voices, faces and music could nullify any improvements the Remake might bring with it.

After having finished the campaign, I can happily say that is not the case, and I am quite surprised what a -largely- great job Hangar 13 made, a studio that was lambasted for the 3rd entry for valid (Incredibly repetitive gameplay loop) and less valid (Not a Mafia game with this setting/character) reasons.

Let's get the obvious out of the way first- the game looks great, especially concerning texture sharpness and lighting, as well as a keen eye for detail and runs quite well for almost looking like a next-gen title. 
It's of course also more modern when it comes to its gameplay and controls (Checkpoints, mission markers, less interactivity, more linearity) though it retains some of the stiffness and weight of the original (Ie. is not as responsive and fluid in its shooting mechanics as Mafia II, for instance, though the cars feel great despite their bulk).

What amazed me the most is how incredibly strong the house is they built on the foundation of the original, which was already known for its strong narrative and (for the time) well-voiced characters which few games since then could match in atmosphere and groundedness, but they managed it- not only did they (mostly) know where to extend missions (Following Morello's plane after it landed instead of just looking at it from afar, celebrating the race, exploring our house and Paulie's apartment before going to the art gallery, creepy prison etc.), they also trimmed some fat where necessary (Planning the heist, driving to and from Salieri's in the race mission et al) and- most strikingly- rounded out the characters to make them and their actions more believable- be it Paulie's mood swings, Tom and Sarah getting aquainted or Sam having a turn of heart, it was all expertly written and acted, which gave it more emotional depth than the already excellent original did.
And while even main characters could be dead-pan in their delivery sometimes before, now also minor characters are voiced well, of which the strongest are probably Detective Norman whose voice and characterization was almost harrowingly believable or Salvatore who is now a proper Italian :D
No disrespect to any of the old cast, as their voices are very nostalgic to me and they did a wonderful job for a game back in the day, but this interpretation is at least as good and develops the characters in a more believable pace.

I also liked how you could explore Salieri's and find little snippets of info all around the missions to learn more of the inhabitants and the world around them, including radio newscasts when you drove alone (As there are now conversations when you ride with your associates).
The new score was well-realized too, though of course nothing can beat the original Intro music ^^

Last but not least, for a modern game it's properly difficult even on normal, you have to use cover/enemy reload cycles and aim well to not quickly die in a rain of bullets.

So after all this praise, what is missing to make this THE Definitive Edition?
[list]
    [*]Melee combat is, though sparsely used, very annoying as you can't just swing and defend with left/right mouse buttons, no, you have separate keys for that and yes, mapping them to your extra mouse buttons does not work
    [*]A game like Mafia lives from its world and interactivity, so having mission markers for every step which can't be completely deactivated are somewhat immersion-breaking. Players should be able to deactivate them completely
    [*]One cannot ride trains or trams. Not that I ever did this much in the original, but why have them only for visual flavour when one could explore the world through them?
    [*]The Lucas Bertone missions have been removed and somewhat reconstituted in Freeride mode- I personally don't mind much as I found them to be a bit too simple and/or light-hearted for the serious tone of the story, but more side-content outside of collectibles (As much as I love foxes) would further enhance the world
[*]No photo mode for such a gorgeous game is almost criminal :D
[*]Shooting and movement could be more responsive, now sometimes it feels too deliberate to do certain things
[*]Many tracks of the old licensed soundtracks are missing, adding them would add a great nostalgic kick, even if there's nothing wrong with the new ones (Albeit not as in the focus as before)
[*]Cutting Morello Jr.'s train assassination attempt was a tad disappointing, that was a great segment of the original and the only thing I really missed from the cut content
[/list]
All in all, I can see myself coming back to this remake again and again - just as with Mafia II- as it plays and looks better than the original to boot and is also great to experience on a narrative level, which is why I can recommend it- despite its flaws- to old and news fans alike, anyone really who likes story-driven games and is a little bit tired of huge open-worlds that offer little originality or substance.
Now I can bathe myself in nostalgia without giving up halfway through because the random physics drive me nuts :D

67,Mafia Definitive Edition,76768773,english,"If Mafia 2 and Mafia 3 had a child, this would be the product. The structure, story, voice acting quality, and overall better retelling of Tommy's tale feels a lot like Mafia 2. Meanwhile, the gunplay and movement feels a lot like Mafia 3. HOWEVER, Tommy controls very, very different than Lincoln. While some animations are reused, none of them are overtly out-of-character. On Classic difficulty Tommy is very squishy, much slower than Lincoln, and behaves much more realistically combat-wise. Granted, he's got that 'action hero' flair at points, but that's with every video game protagonist. 

The gunplay can be rough at times. Apart from the shotguns, bolt action, and the magnum, the other guns can feel kind of weak. Enemies tend to soak up bullets- you usually need to shoot someone about five or six times (excluding headshots and previous mentioned weapons) to kill them with the pistols and tommy gun. It wouldn't be so bad, but there's some strange inaccuracy hard-coded into the guns. The pistol especially has only a circular crosshair, and the bullet could land anywhere within it, so precise shots have some luck involved. However, it does make Tommy feel much more untrained and clumsy, and gun battles feel more realistic with exchanged, sustained fire and use of cover. When you enter an 'arena', you aren't going to headshot or down each enemy quickly, at least not until you get pretty good at the combat. Cover, waiting for reloads, popping out for quick shots, and pushing when it's tactical are going to be your friends on Classic.

Overall, missions felt difficult and challenging, but usually fair enough. Sometimes you are put in a bad spot, and the only way you're making it out without dying is quick thinking and a good aim.

Only two missions had me feeling genuinely frustrated, beyond the enjoyable challenge. The racing mission, 'Fair Play', and a mission with an extremely open docks section, with snipers and many well-armed enemies with a lack of health boxes. [b] If you want to win the race mission on Classic difficulty: spam the 'ram' button to take corners and avoid spinning out on the grass. [/b] The docks mission was simply practicing and multiple tries.

Overall, a very good remake, and great for both people who have and haven't played the original. A vast improvement graphically and gameplay-wise from Mafia 3, but some pieces are still there.

[b] TLDR:  Great remake, definitely worth it. Not perfect, in-between Mafia 3 and Mafia 2 in most aspects. Driving feels good, combat is clunky at times but decent. The story additions, character changes, and voice acting are an improvement from the original IMO. If you like Mafia 2, or Mafia 3, you'll probably enjoy this game.

I've seen other people having these problems so I'm glad knowing it isn't just my game having constant hiccups.

On top of this being a bug-filled shitfest, I've also noticed how lazy the devs actually got with this remaster in a creative sense. I implore you to walk around on the street and just listen to the NPCs. Most of these NPCs have the dialogue that I'd expect from dense pre-schoolers on the playground. It's just poorly-written one-liners that don't converse well together. Instances like ""How is it coming along?"" replied to with ""Sure."" I wish I was joking but 5-10% of them don't actually have voice actors. They used DEFAULT MICROSOFT TEXT TO SPEECH for some male voice lines. It's abysmal how little they actually tried. The first time I heard it I thought 'No, there's no way', but sure enough, it was. Actual text-to-speech substitution for voice lines in a ""AAA remaster"".

Many will think I'm just being anal about these things, but that just screams that they didn't really give a shit about this remaster other than a graphics/engine overhaul. The game is just a blatantly empty husk outside of the story. I can confidently say that anyone who gives this game a positive review really didn't pay too much attention when they were playing or they just gawked at the graphics the entire time. I wasn't even actively looking for these mistakes. They often came to me or I just passively noticed them throughout my playthrough. I was hoping for a game that rivaled Mafia II with a new protagonist but I was only met with a steaming pile of dog shit that screamed ""Thank you for your sixty-dollar preorder."" They eventually fixed Mafia III into a game that I learned to love, so I can only hope that this massive Fuck You will be fixed by December so I can enjoy it when it's actually finished.

Once again, great fuckin' job 2K. You're really on a roll.


EDIT: I forgot to mention how atrocious the combat in this game is. The gunplay is somehow downgraded from III and feels extremely stiff. The fist-fighting is the worst thing I've ever seen.

There's a ""boss fight"" where you beat a big hulker with a plank and it's the saddest 5 full minutes of mashing the melee button while you're in this endless loop of wack-wack-wack-dodge-wack.

Even if I didn't remember the original one almost beat by beat, the story was still kinda generic and forgettable. The main characters aren't likable imo and the only one to really make an impression was Sam. 

The motivations behind the characters didn't resonate with me and by the end, I was kinda wishing for the game to end. Also, they changed some key characters just enough in the script that their whole demeanor became more aggressive and it didn't really do them any favors.

Gameplay is also really generic aside from the driving mechanics. It's a run of the mill cover based shooter and the only differentiating mechanic from other similar games regarding gunplay is that your health does not regenerate and if you reload too early, all the ammunition still left in the magazine is lost. 
(Only in classic difficulty if I understood correctly).

One of the only saving graces of this game imo is the driving experience. It's really fun in classic mode and the cars handling is pretty period accurate. You can also unlock fast and crazy cars outside the main story, but they serve little to no purpose since you can't take them with you in story mode. Just to drive around the void city streets with literally nothing to do.

That's another problem with this game. The story is linear as hell (as it was in the original also), and that's probably a good thing. However, the freeride mode is open world and you can explore Lost Heaven as you please. Problem is, there's nothing to do in freeride except collecting those aforementioned cars and maybe some other useless collectibles. There's pretty much no replay value what so ever. In a 40$ game, that's bound to put some people off.
Even if you achievement hunt this game to 100% completion, I'd guess at max you'd get around 25 or so hours out of it. If not, then the game's over in less than half that time.

There were minor bugs throughout the game, but nothing really gamebreaking. I'd say wait for a deep sale and get this like 75% off or something to get the most out of it.
Also, I'll take this opportunity to say that if you'd like an actual good game based on roughly the same time period then have a look at L.A Noire. It's cheap nowdays since it's an older game, but well worth the time investment and a much better experience overall than this.

EDIT #1: The game doesn't run great. I've seen some people say it runs good on lesser hardware than mine, but then I thought that might as well write a concise tl;dr about it at the end here.

So with a 2080ti, 32GbRAM and a 9900K @3840x1080 32:9 this game ran very inconsistently. With native resolution, fullscreen and all settings set to max quality, I got anything from 1% low 56FPS to 120FPS with AVG. being somewhere around 90FPS. Lowering settings to medium gave a pretty consistent avarage 110FPS, but then the 1% lows were for some reason even lower @48FPS... Go figure. Also, even tho gamebreaking bugs were far and few between (if any), there were some really noticeable graphical glitches throughout the game.

Also, for some reason even if the game ran avarage >100FPS on medium settings, for some reason it didn't always feel like it. My monitor is 144Hz, and I can tell the difference when playing with a 60Hz or a +100Hz monitor. Even when I checked that the monitor is set to native 144Hz, most of the time in game it felt like it was 60Hz for some reason. Though this worth mentioning.

The driving is absolutely fantastic, so much fun and when you get into a fast car it really feels powerful on simulation.

The AI is actually really fantastic, I had a lot of fun during the shootouts.

In terms of the gameplay, one thing to improve is fist/melee fighting, you can beat most fights in hard mode by spamming Q.

I would love for something between this and mafia 2 classic with a bit more to do with the free roaming like robbing shops. Between some missions (only on occasion) it would be great to have a little side mission or two to attend to, something to help [wife] with, or with one of your crew members.

I bought this game due to the high praise the original game from 2002 received and I can't say I was disappointed one bit. I can't speak for those who played the original game since I've never played this before, however coming from someone who's never played Mafia before I can safely say this is an excellent narrative with some gorgeous visuals to boot.

The story takes it time to shape up and you start to learn the names and the personalities of all the side characters you meet a long the way. I won't spoil any of it but it's a great cinematic experience that I really enjoyed, hence why I binged this game in 2-3 sit downs.

The gameplay is about what you expect from a modern 3rd person shooter where the main praise comes from it's story and characters. It's basic at best and doesn't do anything you haven't seen before if you've ever played Uncharted, Gears of War and Grand Theft Auto (However those games the combat is way more engaging).

There's only a handful of weapons you'll get access to throughout the main campaign and not all of them feel even remotely useful during these missions. The Bolt Action rifle was flat out useless and with it's limited ammo capacity and the fact most missions have you pushing forward it's just a useless weapon to use.The Tommy Gun and Shotgun both felt better but still only situational which was fine considering most enemies would be carrying these weapons so switching on the fly was possible. I relied solely on my pistol and revolvers the whole time, you can't beat that Headshot instant kill on all enemies.

The Open World element I've not touched all that much but considering I wasn't really interested in exploring the city of Manhattan I just didn't bother. This game feels like it would of been a better linear game especially with the inclusion of 'Skip the Drive' which I ended up turning on after Mission 3/4 I believe, it's really not at it's best when it's trying to create a huge Open World to explore but rather a linear atmosphere driven experience. Plus when a game gives you the option to skip, it usually implies it's not really a feature the game expects you to consistency rely on.

The story feels somewhat rushed at the end and when I thought this epic finale was going to happen, I got that achievement stating the game was completed. I enjoyed the final mission and the Epilogue was a nice send off to the characters we love and a somewhat brief introduction to the characters from Mafia 2 but considering the rest of the story was excellent and pretty well paced I can't complain about this final product.

9.5/10

Pros: Graphics, Story (ofc), Theme ( I really like the 30'), Music, Optimization (many would argue here but for me with rx570 4gb 8gb DDR4 Ram and AMD RYZEN 5 processor with the help of some manual settings optimization I can run it around 40- 50fps in medium-high settings)

Cons: I am reaching the end of the story and I'm only at 10 hours gameplay, Free ride mode is not ready yet, there is only a big map some cars and some police, no miniquests or side activities and after 3 hours of playing, it might start to freeze for 3-10 seconds, or the game/ cutscenes (there are plenty of them) might take long to load unless installed in SSD

[b]More or less positive:[/b]
- The story is great. Although I was a bit skeptical, the new voice acting is great (even if once or twice maybe a bit over-acted). I really understand why they went with the new VAs as they remodeled the characters after them. The story has gotten a good revamp: they made a lot of the scenes make a bit more sense and filled some holes, still keeping the overall story arc exactly the same, and I think they nailed it. They clearly mainly focused on the story and it paid off.

- The graphics are good too. Now, I don't have a very good computer and I couldn't get the FPS above 50, but it still was mostly steady. I did get a couple of those freezes from time to time, usually when something new happened or opened the options menu during game. The screen just froze for like 30 seconds, but otherwise than that, the game ran pretty well even on my old laptop. (Though I have to say I get those freezes (albeit lasting only a second or two) with other games too, so it could be just my PC) Other than that, no crashes. A few minor bugs, nothing serious.

- The driving and shooting is good. There's a lot of both in the main story and it's fun. The cars feel great and pushing the pedal to the medal is satisfying (even if they are unrealistically easy to handle and fast). Shooting could be better, but it's fine. It's fun most of the time and the weapons feel good. Although I ended up using mostly only the Semi-auto Pistol and the Tommy Gun and the other weapons really didn't feel that much different. The cover system could have been better. Sometimes Tommy just couldn't get out of cover and sometimes he couldn't stay there. It was a bit inconsistent and most of the time I didn't bother to even cover properly, but just held down my aim and manually moved to look behind covers. That worked well too, but if there is a cover system, it should work well.

- The missions also got treated. Mostly it's good: they made them a bit more modern and added some small gameplay elements and generally they are less frustrating. They also added some variety, so there's more sneaking for example, so that not every mission is just drive and gun. But they also made the missions a lot more linear. It was okay during the missions and the story, but in hindsight I kind of missed the open approach style of the Classic game.


[b]Negatives:[/b]
- Replayability is definitely the weakest link. The main story is great and all, and I don't regret buying the game. But aside from the main story, there is not much to do. There is Freeride, but it feels a bit lacking: you can change your clothes, get the weapons and pick your car, but after that there's pretty much only collecting the collectibles. Sure, it's fun driving around, shooting cops and messing around, but it can get old quite fast.

- No side missions. I get that they didn't add anything new: I was hoping to see Mafia 2's police system with changeable license plates and clothes, as well as car body shops where to properly tune your car. It's my own fault to expect changes that weren't even on the original game, but I do find it reasonable to expect the content there was in the original game. Where are the side missions? It was a bit of a let down. It's not like they would have added very much content, but I still missed them.

- A lot of little details are missing or changed, like infinite ammo while driving and auto-aim when shooting while driving. Trams and trains not usable (they even added buses, but you can't enter them as a passenger either), less cars, you can steal any car without Ralphie teaching you, no money system in Freeride and there is no gun shop, you just have access to all guns in Salieri's Bar, etc. Little details like these made the Original Game unique, but there's not many of those present here. There are some, like the police coming after you for speeding and wrecking stuff on the sidewalk. First getting a ticket rather than being arrested at first sight. You can change between manual and automatic transmission, etc., but still many things are missing.


[b]In summary:[/b]
I can't think of that many big negatives, but it's rather that the positives could have been more positive. As a fan of the original game, I loved to come back to this gem and experience the story yet again. But to be honest, this game doesn't break any limits and there isn't anything we haven't seen before. The story is awesome, but that's pretty much what this game is about. I seriously hope they make some DLCs and give us some extra content.

If you haven't experienced the story and are a sucker for good stories, I'd say 40 bucks ain't that much. I certainly did enjoy the game and the story and don't regret spending the money. But if you are on the fence or money is tight, maybe wait for a sale. I hate to admit it, but the main story is about only 10 hours long and some people might not considering it worth the 40 bucks, which is understandable.",1601377919,1601379297,TRUE,1,0,0.523809552,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,75,19,780,780,780,1601373918
26,Mafia Definitive Edition,76755909,english,"I wish I could add a ""mixed"" recommendation rating.

In comparison to the original game, the replayability of the remake is close to zero. The authors of the remake clearly missed a few key aspects of why the original was so memorable. Therefore, I believe that the only two reasons to play the remake over the original are the graphics (which are amazing!) and the extended story line.

Why am I so harsh about the replayability? Take for example the very first mission. It is a car chase where you are chased by Morello's thugs. In the remake, you can get rid of an enemy car by entering a simple pre-made ""trap"", in which a cutscene plays where the enemy car follows you but crashes and explodes (who the hell thought that was a good thing to implement?) . Therefore, getting rid of an enemy car is extremely easy, so in order for the mission to have any value, the devs had to add in about 10 more enemy cars, which takes away from the realism a lot (why and how on earth would Morello assemble so many men just to catch two enemies?).

This is how the mission plays out in the original: you are chased by a (single!) enemy car, but YOU as the player are required to figure out a clever way how to escape. The enemy car tries to push you to the side and you have to somehow figure out a way to force it to crash, or you have to drive fast enough to escape. The time required to complete the mission is about the same, even though there is only a single enemy car trying to catch you. In addition, the enemy car *always acts differently*, which adds immense *replayability* value even to the very first mission! The developers of the remake seem to be completely oblivious to this.

This same pattern can be seen throughout the entire remake, where the enemy positions in every mission seem to be pre-planned, so you always know where every enemy will be and how they will approach you. In the original game, all enemies had entirely free will, so every time you replayed a single mission, everything played out differently. This, again, leads me to the two key main differences between the two games: *replayability* and *realism*. To provide more examples - how on earth did the developers of the remake think that the turret in A Trip to the Country would add value to the gameplay? All it does is take away realism. The game shouldn't be a goddamn Marvel movie or a James Bond flick! (In addition, the turret is *extremely* hard to destroy when playing on PC.)

Also, I really miss being able to successfully complete the mission in Hotel Corleone in a stealthy fashion.

So, if you haven't played the original, do yourself a favor and play it. You would get the wrong impression here.

38,Mafia Definitive Edition,76721263,english,"Hangar 13 strikes again, this time ruining an old classic.

The remake is doing an alright job on the visual and audio front, however there is a lack of game features/content/mechanics outside of the story missions - which btw went by way too fast. I think it felt short mainly because they take ALOT of shortcuts within the cutscenes that you frequently get. Overall the story was butchered in many ways.

There is no customization for anything and most of the time you are NOT allowed to pick your own guns/cars as the mission will overwrite your selection. I would understand a lack of customization for guns (although even there you could stay historically authentic and offer some options) but then you should atleast include a few more weapons, the list is really short.

If you take away the emotional factor that fans of the original game will have duo to all the nostalgia, there isn't much else for you. The AI is again pretty dumb and nothing of a challenge in combat. The sneaking mechanics offer the bare minimum and lack simple things like distraction.

The police system is total BS as you have whole armies uf squad cars spawning right in your area and somehow everyone has a smartphone and police radio to call for the cops/backup in the freaking 30s ?!

The soundtrack is good however it seems really short as they overuse every track quite alot which gets really annoying quickly. And whoever decided to use music of suspense (probably their stealth track) in a simple restaurant chat doesn't have any clue about music and it's right use...

Duo to the lack of any interesting side activities/missions or customization things, the free ride mode is pretty much useless and not interesting unless you wanna drive around doing nothing or battle some dumb AI cops who will just ram right into you like a freaking kamikaze pilot... Eh nope.

They totally ruined some of the characters, especially Paulie turned from a likeable character into a total moron who you hardly feel sorry for.

Oh and I was kinda disappointed how little new things or changes/alterations there were to the story and mission designs. I was hoping that theywould  surprise us people who have played the original game many times, either with new missions or some interesting changes... Unfortunately... nope. Huge disappointment and missed opportunity right there.

Get this game when it's on sale, but only if you have no sense for good games (like 3/4 of the reviews here who apparently give good ratings simply because ""there is a tommy gun""...) or out of nostalgia want to see the original story in a worse and slightly altered version, or if you simply enjoy the 30s atmosphere.",1601313023,1601374207,FALSE,1,0,0.5,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,388,19,849,849,849,1601311039

Running on an 8 year old PC on low, hitting 60fps. No major bugs or crashes, have noticed a sparse amount of floating objects. Some comments mention no blood, I'm seeing medium levels of violence, not none, not Tarantino, just an okay amount.

As an avid fan of the original Mafia, I was figuratively frothing to get my hands on this title. While I love Mafia II the pacing of the OG Mafia really lent itself to me. Just a bit slower. The visuals look good, some things seem significantly better than others. Main characters look excellent, NPCs look significantly worse for example. The music, radio, voice acting and body animations (for main characters) is great. Overall, if this gets a few patches to fix whatever stability options that others seem to have and QoL issues, I think this is an excellent copy of Mafia.

For you OG Mafia players; the racing in this is far easier IMO (playing on Classic)

I can say that I'm satisfied. The original game needed a remake since it aged worse and worse every year with awful driving and combat mechanics and the loss of the original soundtrack.

The Definitive Edition is not simply a 100% faithful remake, it's a 2020 reinterpretation of what Mafia could have been in 2001.

I know they removed some things from the original game but TBH it's not a big deal and I still recommend checking out the original game.

I was disappointed by the reused assets and animations from Mafia 3, the awful TAA that you can't disable and blurs everything and the race mission that forced me to lower the difficulty.

48,Mafia Definitive Edition,76753410,english,"First of all I don't write reviews often. It's my third review from ten years, but I think this remake well deserves my review. So anyway here is my honest opinion on this game : I've played the original back in 2002, I liked little details like how great is car handling and you can run out of fuel....etc and it was the most amazing story in any videogames ever.  In this remake I think they did a great work and make the game as close to the original one as it can be. So far I enjoying it well, the car handling on simulation is very enjoyable with manual transmission and every car feels different. The graphics and the city looks amazing they really put energy into details. At Downtown areas you will find more traffic in the mornings and less traffic at night, the city is a living place, people or parking their cars, read newspapers, sit on benches. The story is as it was but with more deep characters and more cutscenes., especially I like more the new Paulie over the old one. They make a classic difficulty which makes the game hard like in the old one, one or two bullets and you died, police will come after you if you go above the speed limit. It feels challenging and enjoyable. I was a bit skeptic about Hangar 13, as the 3 installment of Mafia was very weak at almost every point, but I think they really made things good here with this remake. Also they left the original one's secrets and easter eggs in free ride so you can go for the collectibles like outfits, cars and weapons if you want to. If you  are more into open world and sandbox games like GTA this isn't as it wasn't ever been. It's a linear story orientated single player game and in my opinion it's worth the 40$. There are a few bugs which you can run into, but nothing serious.

But i am glad to state that my doubts can go away since this game is amazing in almost all aspects.

Pros : 
Graphics is gorgeous especially the city at night time , rain and neon lights reflecting on rain drops. The car reflections are so good. The performance was also solid gave me avg 80 fps in all high ultrawide 2560x1080 in my RTX 2060.
Overall best thing of the game is the story mocap cutscenes and voice acting. The actors have done a stellar job in delivering the emotions along with their dialogues we really understand the characters and their motives. I had played the original but dont remember most of the story & i was genuinely engaged from start to end with the story and characters. The pacing and story is kept same as original. Driving has really been improved cars and bikes felt good to control and there was little difference too between various cars ( i played in realistic handling mode ) . Gunplay was alright nothing standing out but got the job done.

Cons :
Daytime shadows and reflections were sometimes a bit off, there were considerable amount of pop ins too. Most of the guns sounded the same. Melee combat and animations were really bad. They could have added few side content that would have fit with narrative as optional missions during chapters like collecting protection money or a date with sarah or being a wheelman to gang members etc. The city looks and feels amazing but we never explore it much because there is nothing to do out of main missions.

I say no side content as a con just because of the fact that this is a remake and this gives chance for the devs to rework on some stuff that was lacking in original. But i guess they played a bit too safe which is totally understandable. 

Overall the game as it is , is an amazing story driven gangster action game. From start to end its fully story focused, paced well and keeps the player engaged with no extra busywork or side stuff.

The game is overall very interesting and intense at momments. A bit narrow in the way missions are completed but you still have some freedom of choice.

The thing I enjoyed the most is atmosphere. They achieve something impressive with the way Lost Heaven feels alive.

Not so good (yet):
Combat is boring. Aiming and cover is based on the ""get cover"" mechanic that I don't like.
[i]Open world[/i] is still poor (invisible walls, limited parkour, no jump).

Having no money system is boring but i never played the original so i wont complain too much there.
Theres only a story, in mafia 2 half the fun for me was just messing around.
It feels like im playing a really old game, when i tab out it goes black for a good 10 seconds, sometimes in cutscenes the game would just go black and i would need to reopen it.
You cant barely run over pedestrians, either they jump away perfectly every time or they dont react to getting hit by a car they just keep standing and then fall over.

As a kid, I never actually beat the entire game. I did make it pass the infamous racing level, but the rest of it was too hard at the time. With the 2002 version being a little too clunky for me nowadays, I am so glad to have had a chance to replay this game again, the right way. This is an absolutely amazing remake of a classic game. Here is my Pro & Con List, just as a side note, I beat this game on the Classic difficulty:

Pros:
- Amazing story
- Fun gameplay
- Great music
- Gorgeous graphics
- Cars are a lot of fun
- It does ""feel"" like an older game, and very linear in most respects (though I actually found this to be a good thing, as there is no ""filler"" BS to deal with)

Cons:
- Too short! (not really, but considering that the series goes downhill from here, I never wanted this game to end)
- The damned racing level (although it's easier than it was originally, on Classic it was still pretty tough) 
- I personally really hate the animation for throwing molotovs and grenades, lol. It just looks whack.
- I had one weird audio glitch during a particular cutscene with Frank, but it only occurred once.
- Little graphical things here and there, but nothing game breaking, and I had zero crashes the entire time that I played

There are few gripes, the game is not hard, even on its hardest difficulty (gunfights, stealth and melee)
Driving is little bit harder on simulation but it's manageable....until...when you get to the RACING MISSION.

RACING MISSION is bit too harsh on players, it is probably the most frustrating part of Mafia. You cannot skip or ignore this mission, you MUST finish FIRST, not second or third, FIRST. 
If you are playing this on Classic, you will know, how frustrating it is to drive, I felt like the true winner like Souls Series when I got the first place. The racing could've been bit more flexible, devs should give an option to skip it if the player kept losing the mission... Other than that, the game is cool.

We'll start with what works: The game play is more on par with recent 3rd person action games, and feels tight regardless of how you choose to play this title with one caveat I will mention later. The driving is easy to manage, and even the simulation mode feels refreshing with the class of vehicles you will commonly find yourself behind the wheel of. The soundtrack ambience mixed with the classical score and gunshots put you right into old mobster flicks. 

On the other hand: I've been playing this title on classic, and the difficulty still seems to be lacking albeit for a few select scenes that seem to be difficult regardless of the mode you play on (The Race Mission... Scream inducing). 

The cover system is a bit wacky as well. Not so much that it detracts from the whole, but enough that you will feel like the game doesn't give you enough context to know what 'is' and 'isn't' cover every now and then.

20,Mafia Definitive Edition,76741309,english,"I would start this review by saying that this is a decent remake of the original (2002) game but really it doesn't come close to being good as the original game.

Apart from the story there isn't any real resemblance to the original game's atmosphere, soundtrack, characters and overall feeling that the original gave the player. This game is a prime example that good graphics don't make a great game as some people think that still to this day. 
There are so many missing things here that the original (2002) game had that I don't even understand how's that possible for a 2020 game? How is that possible that an 18+ year old game has more content and it's better overall than this remake in almost every aspect except the graphics of course being that the original game was made about 20 years ago.

Hangar 13 promised us a ""expanded story"" but that is nowhere to be found in this remake, it's more like it was cut short and not expanded in everything like they said, not only the story part but I mean in general the whole game is a big lackluster. This remake feels like it was rushed despite the one-month delay, who knows how would this game turn out if they didn't delay it for a month to fix and add some things like the ""Classic Difficulty"" for the OG fans.
There are no side missions, there are no Lucas Bertone side missions like the original game had. The side character Yellow Pete is gone, there are literally no traffic lights except for one or maybe two you come across somewhere on the map as I remember. There's nothing really to do in the city when you are playing the ""Story"" and the Free Ride feels like it's put there just because the devs don't want that much backlash from the OG fans because the original game had Free Ride. After each mission ends almost always the next starts right there immediately, there's nothing between them really. They could have put in so much more and really expand the story like they said in the advertisements and teasers but instead the game has much less than the old original game which still blows my mind that I'm repeating this again.
They could have done so much more and expand this game's story, side character development and more but instead they made a lackluster remake that only looks better than the original that's it. At least it's better than Mafia 3, I give them that.

Gameplay part feels almost exactly the same as Mafia 3's gunplay and driving, especially when you drive the motorcycle it feels like its driving system is from a 2004 arcade  game it's that bad. The gunplay is not satisfying like in the original and even Mafia 2 had pretty good gunplay mechanics but this remake feels like it's almost a straight copy and paste from Mafia 3 which was horrible. There are bunch of different kind of bugs and problems like ghosting, clipping, AI getting stuck in the wall, etc. 
I noticed a bunch of invisible walls, going through some bushes makes you lose a chunk of health and crash like you crashed to a brick wall at full speed with your car which is laughable for a 2020 game. The cops literally know where ever you hide so you must continuously drive far away from them so you can escape and lose the ""wanted stars"". The AI seems like it can track you through the walls when in a fire fight. Spoiler warning example: [spoiler] Last mission when you are fighting with Sam at the end of the game. He is literally tracking you through walls and shooting, and you can see him too with this ridiculous yellow marker where it shows Sam's exact position. [/spoiler]

The story part seems good, but I still don't like how they changed the story aspects which seemed not really necessary because the conclusion was the same as from the original game. There are so many more things I can say about this but that would pretty much be too long of a review for this remake. 

Overall this is a decent remake of the original game, but fails to deliver the ""faithfully recreated, with expanded story, gameplay and original score"" that was promised to us. 
This is not the ""Mafia"" I remember and it is definitely much less.

Also, no money system. I was very disappointed in the beginning. 

Ok, they invested everything in the story mode (scripted action) versus the interactive elements (which, again, I loved in Mafia 2), which was fine by me after completing the game.

 Music has been updated and they use more period music.

 Bolt Model T clone is accurate with only rear breaks
 Cons
 Free ride is barren as ever
 Shooting could have been better

34,Mafia Definitive Edition,76629754,english,"The new graphics, combat system and also the small changes to the city are all well done and you can still feel the 1930s spirit of the original Mafia game.
The story as well as the main characters have been altered quite a bit...however it still is one of the best crime stories available in any game to date.

to all players, who loved the original game and consider buying this remake...let me just point out a few things, so you do not end up disappointed due to wrong expectations...as i did:

- in most missions the chases by car / on foot and longer drives to get guns etc. are shortened or replaced entirely by cutscenes.
- Sidemissions are gone. You also do not get any ""free time"" in story mode...its just one mission after another.
- you will not keep the cars you bring back to the bar, but unlock the type of car in the garage once you enter a car. You can spawn one these unlocked cars in different colors at the beginning of most story missions.  
- stop engine without exit, use indicators and all that stuff is not possible...its much less focused on the cars as the original game. Basically like in Mafia 2/3.
- Freeride mode no longer let you earn money, buy guns or savegames at the bar. Instead you start at the bar, where you can change outfits, spawn cars or get guns (all for free)...citymap is daytime and traffic is mostly 1935+. I have not found a possibility to change any of these settings.
- Freeride Extreme: One of my most favorite features in the original game (spent 100s of hours to collect all cars and get them home without a scratch) is missing entirely. Therefore all the special cars are missing as well.

So all in all...you get a good remake of the story mode. But you do not get a good remake of the whole original game.

I personally can not recommend this game for the full price due to a massive lack of endgame possibilities.


EDIT:

After reading a lot of helpful comments here, i gave the free ride mode another shot.
And i stand corrected on a few points of my review:

- It is possible to change the time and weather (by ""using"" different paintings within the Bar)
- There are also a few challenges available, that are similar to some of the original FR extreme challenges. As Rewards you get special guns, outfits and special cars.
 

So you actually do get something to do after the Story...which is good and i also like to point out that this extra content is really fun to play.

For me it just does not replace the FR extreme mode. Its not just that it had more missions and cars. It also was, depending on your personal goal really really challenging.
I wanted to have all cars in perfect condition inside my garage and due to space probs on the lawn in front of the house. As the repair service was closed in FR extreme you would see every mistake made on the return trip each time you look at the car. So beside the sometimes ridiculous hard challenges, the ride home with the prize was equally stressful. But as soon as the car was parked in the right spot...i was happy like a stamp collector finding the final stamp for his album. Sounds strange...but it was an amazing amount of fun to get out of a video game.

The Remake Version on the other hand is far too easy.
Its almost like it aims to make sure the player succeeds.

Let me give you an example:
Both versions do have a challenge where you need to bring a car with a fuel leak to a garage across town:

Original Game: 
i failed a few times, until i found the perfect route through all the gas stations and i arrived with nothing but hope and momentum at the finish line.
I later wanted to add the leaking car to my collection, so i put it in neutral gear and pushed it very very gentle with another car step by step back to a gas station...took me like an hour to finally get it to the house.

Remake: 
i had to stop at two gas stations on the way and i arrived with like 25% gas remaining.
Didnt need to bother with getting the car, as it does not save any parked cars. But i can respawn it at any garage anytime....fully repaired.


On another mission you have to drive ""crazy horse"" within a time limit to a location... sounds  extremely difficult...until you realize the car handles pretty well and you can just pedal to the metal this thing through town. In the original game it was called ""crazy horse"" because it actually handled like said horse.



But enough now, i suppose you get my point.

Overall this is one of the best games I've played in a while. The graphics were amazing, the story was fantastic, the characters were interesting, the missions were extremely fun. I finished my first playthrough (took 11 hours) and I hadn't encountered a single bug and the story was very engaging the entire time. Don't forget the combat, it's so well done. Only thing I dislike is the turning on cars (but i could/probably am just a really, really bad driver lol).

60,Mafia Definitive Edition,76705698,english,"As someone who has played the original game and this so-called ""Definitive Edition"" i have quite a bit to say, and it's not all good. Let's start with the positives.

the music is great

the visuals, while inconsistent look pretty good especially at nighttime

the cars look great and handle quite good

the game sometimes can be fun to play when it has you doing anything that isn't combat related

the map looks quite nice especially in the city areas 

Now let's move onto the negatives.

the main characters have been completely butchered and turned into such unlikable and annoying morons, which does hurt the story a lot because you never end up liking the characters so you never end up caring for them

a lot of missing content from the original game ranging from removed cars, removed side missions and two entirely removed game modes (free ride extreme and the racing mode which was exclusive for consoles)

the map has been made smaller which makes no sense, how can a game from 2002 have a bigger map than a game from 2020?

the combat is completely atrocious, i have no idea what they exactly did to the combat but it feels way worse than the combat in III, feels really stiff and generally very bad

the missions from the original game have been made extremely simplified and very linear (you have to return to the mission area type of linear) , this is one of the main things that kills the game for me and stops me from recommending it, the original game most of the time always gave you choice in how you wanted to approach missions and never treated you like an idiot like this game does

the game treats you like an idiot with annoying markers all over the screen all the time, this ruins any immersion the game is trying to go for, which really sucks since the first two games had amazing immersion mainly because they didn't do stuff like this

the game is quite buggy on PC and runs badly too, even worse than III did which is just unacceptable

the composed music, while it is quite good is very over played and gets very repetitive

the police system is quite stupid, you do something and then usually a witness somehow uses a mobile phone in the 1930s and the cops literally teleport behind right you when that happens instead of actually getting to you


in conclusion: i have never played a game that is this inconsistent, it really shines sometimes (you having the option of taking Paulie home or to the blue tropics without the game telling you) and completely falls flat most of the time mainly due to the combat and the extremely linear missions and it really is quite disappointing because there was a lot of potential that was wasted and i just can't recommend this game especially when it's inferior in really almost every way compared to the original.",1601291605,1601334790,FALSE,389,27,0.733621776,2,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,125,17,1328,1328,1328,1601213169

81,Mafia Definitive Edition,76734390,english,"When I first got my hands on Mafia 1 I was 8. It brought me to the world of video games and it will always have a place in my heart. But to be fair Id not pick that game up again in 2020 no matter how I love it, the graphics seem outdated, mechanics rather clumsy and Id not want to destroy the good memories I have playing it as a child. So when I heard Hangar 13 was planning on releasing a remaster I had to preorder it as soon as it was announced. Couple days after the release Ive finished the game and here I am with my review.

First of all, they did this game a justice. I absolutely love the updated graphics and the depth they added to the story, especially the details of a relationship between Tommy and Sarah. This remake felt more like a movie than the original one did and thats quite an achievement. I was glad some missions were shorter (they got rid of annoying driving and cut straight to the good stuff), but they also made some others longer by adding new interesting content. Another positive thing I really appreciated was that I was able to run this game on High settings in 4K on my budget outdated GPU (RX 580), really good job Hangar 13! 
But now to the things I did not enjoy this much. One I hated the most was for sure movement. I seems like the main target for this game were consoles (bad job Hangar 13...). Most of a time it felt like either Tommy was drunk or my controls were inverted. If youre planning on playing this game brace yourself for hitting every wall around the doors you want to enter, randomly jumping out of a cover in the middle of a gunfight  because you just wanted to change the cover, not being able to sprint on some occasions and tons of other impairments... This applies only for the walking tho. I have no complaints about driving and shooting. Maybe just one, It feels like Auto-aim is never really turned off. Even if I did turn it off in the menu I still felt my ""crosshair"" (another terrible mistake) was snapping to my enemies.
As for the story I mostly enjoyed new additions. The only exception was the ending scene. Dont wanna spoil anything but it sure felt better in the original one. 

So the short summary:

Pros
new graphics
additions to the story and deeper characters
more movie-like

Cons
movement
only 10 hours long main story

Overall Id rate this game as high as the original one or maybe a bit higher (maybe it was not clear from my review but i really love this game too). Id recommend playing this game to everyone who either played the original one or is completely new to the series. You will not regret it!

The remake changed some aspects of nearly all missions and even revealed new interesting background stories, which were missing in the original. The result is you can have a better understanding of the overall history that took place in Mafia. Unnecessary driving has been cut to a minimum, which cuts mission times and lets you focus more on the story. The side quests of Lucas Bertone were removed sadly, but it's not a big deal. I experienced some bugs within the game, but nothing that is gonna impact your gameplay.

Would have been great if they have added some new side quests or kept Lucas Bertone quests but that's just my opinion. 

Just an idea but I think it would be great if Hangar 13 did some sort of expansion for MDE, something similar what they did with ''Mafia 2 Joe's Adventures'' just this time put bit more effort with missions and cutscenes. I feel like it would be great to return to Lost Heaven and maybe see it from a different angle, with a different character and experience the consequences that the main story created.

32,Mafia Definitive Edition,76728984,english,"Here's the TL;DR: I went in, wanting so hard to hate this remake. I ended up loving it and willing to play it again immediately after the credits rolled.

Let me start by saying that I've beaten the original MAFIA over 15 times since 2002 and it's one of my favorite games of all time. I cried foul when I saw the first gameplay trailer, crying that ""This is MAFIA III with a new coat of paint, this is not my MAFIA"". And I went in with the lowest possible expectations.

And guess what. I loved the thing.

This remake takes the game that I love and brings it into 2020. Yes, it borrows mechanics heavily from MAFIA III and uses the same engine, but it actually has good pacing now. The story is kept as is with stuff that didn't make sense before explained better with additional dialogue and cutscenes. Some other missteps of the original narrative are fixed by simply cutting them. Story wise, this is the better version of MAFIA.

The missions are unchanged in order and goals, but are expanded upon in ways I didn't expect. My lizard brain was telling me that I should hate this, because it is not the dated mission design I'm so used to and know inside and out. But after ""Molotov Party"" I actually started loving the way all parts click and move. I actually had fun with the reimagined versions and I'm not sure I'll be able to not scoff at the original version if I play it now.

Atmosphere, music, gameplay, characters, story - it's all there. Free ride is also back and the better part of the Free ride extreme missions are there as well. And while the Lucas Bertone side missions are gone for good from the story mode, you can still get cool secret cars by going to his service station in Free ride.",1601322666,1601322666,TRUE,4,0,0.534161508,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,971,8,1287,1287,1160,1601926182

In this game you can only carry one pistol and one rifle. Cover system gets you stuck and killed regulary. Still a fun game with nice graphics but also quite a few glitches and even more liniar than the classic game. I miss the Lucas Bertone side missions to unlock new cars after the main mission. You can only unlock 5 secret cars and only in free ride and that's it. Completed the game in about 12 hours and there's nothing left to do (apart of collecting all the comics and stuff).

On the other hand, I think they did a fantastic job with the game overall, good graphics, voice acting wasn't bad at all. I played on the classic difficulty and it wasn't really that hard but it did have its moments with the AI hitting some insane shots from time to time xD

I would say i have a mid range PC with a 980 Ti and 6700K CPU and the game ran well with no issues on high settings with an FPS at around 70-80.

I had never played the original Mafia but I have played Mafia 3 DE which I really enjoyed. I have a bit over 40 hours in Mafia 3 DE and I have only completed  the campaign and DLC once. I still have not done all of the turf missions. I was expecting a similar situation doe Mafia DE but boy was I in for a rude awakening. An entire playthrough of the story on Normal only took a little over 6 hours.  I couldn't believe it when I got to the mission that I knew had to be the end and this was only the second day after buying the game. I did enjoy the game however it feels very empty.  The storyline was pretty good, but the city just feels like empty boxes all painted a little different.  There are only a handful of weapons to choose from and about a dozen cars. The game claims there are 41 cars including 5 hidden models but they are counting 5 variants of one car as different cars when in reality all of the models drive nearly identical to one another. I can see myself playing through again on the harder difficulties but I never expected the story to be less than 7 hours start to finish.  

I really wish I could give a neutral review (instead of good or bad) because the game is fun, it looks much better than the screens I have seen of the original however after playing I cant justify the price tag of $40 when I bought Mafia 3 DE (albeit on sale) for $30 and it delivered almost 10 times the play time with one playthrough.

Awesome visuals, story and music, quite challenging on Classic difficulty. 
Shooting is meh, doesn't feel very satisfying when enemies just shrug off 4 bullets and keep firing at you without even loosing their aim. And you don't always get to be in perfect range to keep headshotting them. 
Driving - I don't know how it is in regular mode, in simulation it's quite a challenge, which I guess is how it was intended. Vehicles loose traction very easy on turns if you go over 40. And it kinda feels like npcs don't suffer from the same problem and have vehicle controls on regular mode, while you suffer on simulation.
The main issue I found with the game is that there is nothing to do in this sizable open world. There are a tons of collectibles, but personally I hate it when games use useless trinkets as the only excuse to go around exploring, so I just ignored them if they were out of my way and kept going through the story. Less than 12 hours in - and I'm done. No good motivation to free roam or start a new game.
It's excellent for the story, visuals and music alone, but not at full price.
My opinion - get it on sale. And expect to be done with it within 12 hours. You'll have nothing to regret then.",1601316682,1601316682,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,97,4,706,706,706,1601315471

You now unluck cars by riding in them once, you can't get any of the special cars anymore in freeride mode.

On a side note, the cover system is really bad and the AI acts really stupid in certain situations, not game-breaking but frustrating nonetheless.

This review is still positive because the remake is good nonetheless, I was just hoping for a full remake of the original game. Not just the story...

78,Mafia Definitive Edition,76620098,english,"Finished both games  (this on classic mode and the original one).
Remaster version has some good improvements - Mostly graphics. It's awesome to drive around Lost Heaven in this nice new coat and with all the nostalgia from original game.
But... it's simply not enough. At least not enough for a game with this price tag. And honestly I see this remaster as desecration of original Mafia masterpiece.

[h1]+ PROS:[/h1]
- Graphics is good. Not great not terrible. I like the look but in 2020 it's not something that would make me feel like it's something special. I would compare it maybe to to GTA 4. Some stuff are just made well but something is garbage (eg. reflections, water...). But generally good job here.
- Story and characters remained from original game (well... at least partly... more in cons section)
- Some extra details were added (eg: new cutscenes)
- I also like how they added real news to radio - all these talks about market collapse or second war just helps you to to ""feel"" the time where game is set a little more.

[h1]- CONS:[/h1]
On the other hand... A lot of stuff is buggy, unfinished, game is not very stable and some stuff are just horribly done.
- Sometimes the game just crash. Didn't happen too often but few times it happened. Out of nowhere freeze and nothing to do about it except restart.
- Sometimes when you go to desktop or steam overlay during playing sound gets bugged and all you hear is voice of main characters but nothing else (no music, audience... )
- Sometimes cutscenes just doesn't work (you see first frame of the video and only sound) - I think it could be also related to steam overlay but not sure here
- Story is at the end very rushy (but this was also in the original game)
- Behaving of NPCs is very often joke. Eg. your whole crew is running around in a huge gunfight without any cover. They are immortal. You can be hidden 100m behind them behind cover and once you peek you immediately get hit... but your crew is always ok. Or an NPC lady on the street with calm voice asking ""who is he shooting at"" after I've been 5 min in a shootout with about 15 police officers. 
- Some little details or character specific were changed in the story. Unfortunately in about 90% to worse. Paulie used to be cool and funny. Now he is just stupid and with horrible voice. I wasn't even sad he died like I was in the original one. Sam seems like a teenager and Tommy's personality is absolute opposite of what it was in original one. I felt him in original one and here I just didn't give a damn about him. Also some story details were changed to make it more BS. Don't see a reason why somebody who obviously has no clue about storywriting is touching something that was working well.
- Police system is trash. It's like police was not there at all. In original one there was this wanted system so it was pretty hard to get rid of them. Here? Just drive few blocks and even with 5 starts you will completely lose them as once they lose sight of you they just stop chasing you.
- Some new cutscenes are joke... like it was made in bollywood. Tommy is standing in the fuel leaking from tank and in the warehouse full of explosive barrels... So what he decides? Throw lighter on the ground directly to the fuel and then run like crazy with explosions all around him.
- Lot of missions were removed (missions for Lucas, stealing cars for Ralph...) also a lot of driving parts were just skipped or replaced with cutscene.
- Motorcycles (something new in comparison to original) are just horrible.... really the worst driving experience ever in any game ever. Feels worse than when you are completely drunk in GTA 5 and trying to drive top speed bike.
- Combat system is utter trash (both melee and shooting). Melee is just pressing Q and you kill anybody.. nothing hard about it but also not a big deal as this you use like three times in whole game. Shooting combat is even worse trash and that's the biggest problem of this game because It's all about cover system which is just terribly done in this game.


[b]Why is gunfight system trash:[/b]
- If you cover behind something then you are immortal (no matter if it's a pipe leading from the wall or paper box). People can be shooting at you with Thompsons for hours and you never get a hit even tho your head is visible above the cover. It's not too bad for the gameplay but just feels as a joke.
- If there is more enemies then once you peek you can be 100% sure you get the hit. NPCs here are just much more accurate than they were in the original game... which leads to a problem of Health management. In original game it was all about don't get hit and if you do then find first aid asap otherwise you might get in trouble. Your biggest concern was to keep your health as high as possible. Here it'a a different story - if you get below 15% of your hp it get's automatically restored to this level always after about 3sec. Getting one hit takes about 10% hp and you can be hell sure you get many of hits in this game.... which at the end means you are basically playing with 15% hp all the time, once you get hit you wait for restore and go fighting again.... goes like this over and over. If you find first aid you restore your HP to about 60% which is lost in first 10 sec of next fight and for the rest of the mission it's again only about these last 15%.
Feels like creators of this game just made enemies too strong and to solve this problem they decided to make your health automatically restore but to don't make it too easy they put a limit to 15%.... This is just trash... feels stupid and makes totally no sense. If player was more fragile and died of two hits and all his hp would automatically recover then I say ok... if it was like in original game then it would be also ok... but this hybrid just seems unfinished. Like if they patched it last minute before the release after someone tested ""classic"" mode and figured out it's impossible to finish.
- Aiming is horrible. It's moving from side to side like crazy. Like if this 9mm pistol was as heavy asM60 or you were zoomed to 1km distance... simply bad.

[h1]= SUMMARY:[/h1]
It's a good game. It's fun, story is good, graphics is OK and often it's even enjoyable to play.
But considering most of the stuff was just taken from original game it seems like developers did almost nothing in this game. All they had to do was improve graphics and gameplay. Graphics is improved but gameplay is a huge step back. if I think about the effort they had versus price of the game compared to other games then I feel like I got robbed.

If you want to really enjoy Mafia and you don't mind old graphics then I would recommend the original one - that felt really great, was not buggy, story was well written and detailed, contained more missions and it even was a challenge.
If you want more better graphics (which is something below average in 2020) but don't mind  playing trash made crap mainstream game which is not worthy more than 20EUR then this one is for you.",1601153995,1601316465,FALSE,3,2,0.522194803,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,71,8,1030,1030,1030,1601150313

81,Mafia Definitive Edition,76723749,english,"I remember the day I bought the original mafia on pc back in 2002 when I was 12 and ever since its been up there with my favourite games of all time. For die hard fans of the original like myself the new 'Definitive edition' is to be quite honest, a real let down. 

This remaster has retained the same characters and story line from the original but lacked any real new character development and left me personally not warming to any of the characters depicted. This is down to the change in voice actors who i think were below par and nothing in comparison to the 2002 version. Tommy sounded far too cliche gangster and I couldn't take him seriously or feel the same attachment I had with 2002 Tommy. Paulie was awful. horrible casting choice - the voice actor did not suit this character, his personality has completely changed from tough guy to an anxious pussy. Vincenzo was definitely the best of all but i generally felt the characters lacked the chemistry that made the 2002 version so good.

Cutscenes look beautiful and they were generally entertaining to watch, but again i felt they were sometimes lacking that atmosphere and subtle quality that the original had (again down to the voice acting).

The Graphics are beautiful with textures and lighting being very impressive, which brings the city of lost heaven to life and this was probably one of the few strong points of the game for me. I had issues with pop in some instances with minor bugs here and there. I was quite disappointed with some animations and physics of NPC's which weren't up to today's standards. e.g reactions from pedestrians, enemy AI.

The audio is great, environmental sounds, radio and sound fx were spot on and i was impressed when using headphones. Music in the cutscenes didnt work that well and is different to the original which felt like it was rushing the story along too much and lacked the atmosphere the original portrayed. 

Gameplay is quite fun with driving being the highlight - cars handle realistically and driving sequences are the best part of this game. Gun play and combat is lacklustre and is very similar to mafia 3. The worst part of the gameplay is the constant holding of your hand and on screen messages and prompts with no way to turn this off either. The game is very linear and this made it lose its soul and became too much of an arcade game in the end. 

Overall Mafia definitive edition is basically mafia 3 but set in a different era, with improved textures and lighting. The only resemblance it has with the original is the story and map with small improvements. This new version is sadly completely lacking soul and is just a basic linear game that doesnt give you the freedom, joy and excitement the original classic did.

There's no weight to it. The original score is totally forgettable. The licensed OST as well. I honestly can't remember a single song from the Definitive Edition (compared to the original, where I remember every single song, as well as the FANTASTIC original soundtrack).

The story bits that they changed made little to no sense.

Late and end-game spoilers I guess:
[spoiler]Sam asking you not to kill Michelle (the ""lady of the night"" in the hotel), and then blaming Tommy for not killing her during the Death of Art mission. What????

Salieri openly saying that they're stealing diamonds during ""Just a Relaxation"", and then it turning out to be dope was really out of place as well.

The icing of the cake is TOMMY asking to meet Sam at the gallery, which A: makes no sense, and B: you're telling me Sam got ten billion goons at the gallery so soon? In the original it made more sense because Sam asked Tommy to meet him there so he had time to prepare....[/spoiler]

I couldn't get used to the new voices of Tommy and Paulie too. Tommy was especially flat, especially when
[spoiler] you find Paulie's body in his apartment. The difference in delivery is so jarring. [/spoiler]

They just turned Tommy into a generic mobster, not only in the voice department, but his whole character changed as well.

Ralph, Salieri and Sam were decent, but I still prefer the original VO.

Overall, I honestly would prefer an up-resed original over this.

95,Mafia Definitive Edition,76721795,english,"Tldr: the game falls short of the original, don't expect the same nostalgic experience.

Firstly, Definitive Edition definitely has its pros: characters and the city are visually beautiful, the story is mostly true to the original Mafia (at least the missions are the same) so the narrative flows seamlessly, game mechanics are adequate and if this game wouldn't be a remake, I would surely recommend it as a fresh take on the genre. But sadly it's a remake, so I expect certain things of it.

In the original Mafia the characters feel authentic and voice acting is true to a cinematic experience. However in this game Sam and Paulie sound like 17-year-old chads (especially Paulie) and Tommy sounds like a grumpy Batman from Nolan's works without any emotional attachment to anything. Mostly it's a bit hilarious and in rare moments fitting, but more than occasionally it just gets annoying and [spoiler]completely ruins Sam's ""You broke the Omerta"" -speech in the last mission. Actually, there even isn't the Omerta speech, because they re-wrote the speech completely. Now you don't feel sad that the situation got to a point where your friend chose the family over his closest pals, but just want to shoot that chad punk so he would shut up. That's a shame, since most of Tommy's, Paulie's and Sam's interplay is entertaining to watch.[/spoiler]

I'm not the most professional guy to review the technical aspects of the game, but for some reason every graphic setting below 4K high produces jagged edges in objects. Might be a technical thing, might be me just fucking up the settings. I dunno. 

What I do know is that in certain situations the game let's me progress with relative ease despite first trying and failing several times. [spoiler]In the infamous race mission after 10+ attempts the A.I. drivers conveniently pile up on the first corner, letting me pass from last position to first. After that, one guy catches me in the last lap and overtakes. However, in the second-last corner his car plummets to wall, allowing me to drive to an easy win. If that's a bug or just a coincidence, then fine. If the game lets me win just out of pity, that's just underestimating the player. Also in the sniper assassination mission I escaped from the prison without a chase, because all of a sudden the police stopped giving a shit that I just murdered a candidate. The kept the roadblocks in place, but allowed me to pass through.[/spoiler]

[spoiler]The epilogue was way off. That speech that Tommy gave about the importance of family was just cringy, but not the worst thing. The absolutely worst and mind-numbingly stupid thing was to spend 10+ hours watching Tommy learn that being a mobster in the 30's isn't that great and glamorous, and after that be forced to listen to an embarrassing gangsta rap song from the 21th century about how cool it is to be a gangster and kill people as the credits roll. Like what the hell man, one of the main reasons to buy the remake is to hear that awesome soundtrack of the original game. The original soundtrack is mostly (if not completely?) absent from this game and in the end replaced with a fucking modern rap song. And finally, when Tommy got whacked there wasn't a single sign of terror in him like in the original game, just calm acceptance of his fate. Like I said earlier, he felt through the game totally unattached to anything and in the end just took the blast like he was ready for it. It's a narrative choice, yes, but not true to original Mafia.[/spoiler]

I don't want to sound too unreasonable nor I was expecting an exact copy of the original game with updated graphics, but when it comes to delivering a compelling story this game feels too way off from the original to be called a remake. It's more like a reboot. The game rushes you through the story like it's a guided tour in an amusement park and you see (as Ulfric put it in Skyrim) strangers wearing familiar faces.

6,Mafia Definitive Edition,76713854,english,"The original Mafia from 2002 made by Illusion softworks is one of those games that is considered a classic, while it had its fair share of issues, just like any other game had, it was and to this day still is one of the best story driven third person action games out there. Back in the day there was nothing like this, the story is amazing. The game has a fantastic attention to detail and the weapon handling and shooting mechanics are realistic. The driving model is realistic too.

 This remake while being graphically on par with todays standards is however not as good as the original. After finishing the game on classic dificulty, which should be the hardest dificulty setting isn't even that hard, especially when compared to the original. The game offers an amazing scenery when driving or walking through Lost Heaven, it's a bit underwhelming out in the countryside though. There are several, quite unnecessary and surpising changes to various parts of the city, for example Hoboken is now renamed to Hollbrook or Oakhill to Beech Hill, New Ark to North Park and the layouts of various places have been drastically changed too. For example Salieris bar is in a different location.

There is a lot of stuff Iam not so fond of aswell. The shooting and cover system is straight out of the atrocious Mafia III game, it feels outdated, there is no feedback or recoil on the guns, you can one shot every enemy even from afar with a tommygun if you aim to the head. The enemy AI and behaviour is based on scripts unlike the original where the AI was quite unpredictable. The game is too easy even on the hardest dificulty. You can only carry one siderarm and one longarm weapon. The shooting feels like incredibly bad and  low budget. Same goes for the driving mechanics, even on classic the game is quite forgiving, you basically can't crash even on the new addition that is the motorbike. You can use the dumbed down ram button that gives you a sort of nitro boost and you can pretty much abuse it to get out of tight situations. The scripted escape routes are laughably bad, same goes to the in game auto aim when you cannot shoot out the tires of police  or gangster cars chasing you, you can only disable their vehicle if you shoot it enough times. The story albeit the same as the original is different in several things, the order with which the missions are played has changed, most of the dialogues have been rewritten and not necessarily for the better. MIssions are dumbed down, the structure of most of them doesn’t make any sense. It’s a dumb corridor, go here, search there, then go there. Convenient objective placement, go from point A to point B over and over again. No variability. Writing is atrocious, some of the dialogues are fun but most of the script is like it was written by an angsty teenager who watched some mafia drama on the TV. Game feels and plays like a low budget remake of the original.

Overall it's not a terrible remake, but it's most definitely not a good one either. For fans of the original it's a massive nostalgia trip back in time when it comes to graphics and atmosphere in some missions, but everything else, the character models, shooting and driving mechanics, writing and gameplay feels dumbed down, simplified and generic. Good exterior but incredibly shallow interior. The remake feels soulless as a result. 

Iam sure this remake is a precursor of things to come from hangar13, we can expect a full blown new Mafia game announcement soon and quite frankly Iam not that excited after their last two terrible attempts.",1601303761,1601312533,FALSE,0,1,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,210,77,1104,1104,1104,1601303737
7,Mafia Definitive Edition,76720776,english,"I dont normally write reviews for games but man is this game deserving of one. I think this is truly one of the best experiences I have had and after the train wreck that Mafia 3 was, this game is truly a breath of fresh air. The aesthetic is fantastic, the story is amazing and the game feels and plays great. I was honestly very impressed by how good this game is and for only 40 dollars. Do I have some issues with it? sure, no game is truly perfect and this game is far from it. The story is fantastic and truly one of the better ones. The time period is great and exploring a fictional New York/Chicago was a wonderful time. I do have some negatives but they just need patches to be fixed. 
1. Minor bugs with animations not working properly, i.e you shoot a guy and rather than dying he'll just sit there like he just walked in on you with his wife.
2. The handling on some vehicles suck
3. Audio error where I would lose all sound just before cutscenes so this means I missed some in the first few hours of gameplay. (Fixed by rebooting the game)
As far as story goes my only complaint (fault in the story telling not necessarily something that can be fixed) is how linear the game is, while Mafia 2 was linear-esque you could still run around this game is still very much just jumping mission to mission. I also disliked how major events in Tommys life were skipped over like his alcoholism, his wedding, etc. theyre just all briefly mentioned and shrugged over. All in all fantastic title and you honestly cant beat it for the price. I beat it in 11 hours on classic difficulty but im sure if you take your time in the easier difficulties the game can take much longer.",1601312429,1601312429,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,239,3,672,672,672,1601285460

12,Mafia Definitive Edition,76720391,english,"To be perfectly honest, I am afraid that I can not recommend this game if you've ever played the original Mafia. I will however recommend the game to anyone that hasn't played the original one, just for the incredible story. I know that comparing a new game to the one released 18 years ago isn't exactly perfect, but hear me out.

The most important thing - the story - is made really well. It's straight to the point, expanded a little bit, and just as amazing as in the original game. The cutscenes are really well done and really worth watching, but then again, if you're playing the story mode, there's no point in skipping them at all. The animation/art team, or whatever, did a very good job. The characters' emotions, animations and voice overs are done very well, keeping you on your toes for most of the playthrough.

Driving is fun, too. It's not as sturdy as in the original Mafia game, and you can definitely feel the difference when driving various automobiles. There's no fuel meter and you don't really need to learn how to steal the car to be able to use it in the story mode. It seems like all of the cars are unlocked from the get-go, and you don't need to learn how to pick the locks, which is a kind of a bummer. 

The gun fights are really disappointing. The NPCs act like bullet sponges and you just don't get the same feeling as you did in the previous games. Sure, it's difficult, with almost no health regeneration and enemies that can shoot pretty well (I played on the Classic difficulty setting). But just because they can shoot well, does not mean the game is good. The NPCs have barely a brain of their own, they'll just walk out in the open and get shot, sometimes not even reacting to being shot themselves, like it's a Terminator movie or something. When you're doing jobs with some of your friends (Sam and Paulie), they're pretty much invulnerable. Walk out in the open, get shot a million times and still get the job done. This sucks and kills the vibe. If I recall correctly (I may be wrong, though), in the original game each of your friendly NPCs had a health meter of their own, and you had to be very careful and act quick to not let them die. This feature has been completely scrapped in the remake. The ammunition is scarce, yet the enemies take 4-5 shots from the 1911 and can survive half the clip off of a Tommy Gun and still somehow shoot you back and make it to cover. If you die, the death scene takes forever to fade, and you'll probably die a lot. Go figure.

Using medkits? Well just open the first aid box that's planted neatly on the wall and watch the meds disappear on you. Why?

Shooting and driving is a huge no-no as well. All you do is just tap a fire button. The gun is being aimed automatically and you can't mess it up. Where's the fun in that? 

SPOILERS AHEAD!

The atmosphere and the music is amazing. I could recommend the game just for that, but the game is littered with bugs. I am not sure if that's just my experience, as I've read through some of the reviews and didn't find too much complaints (but I did find some). I'd like to explain some of my unpleasant encounters with said bugs below.

In the mission where you're supposed to chase Morello on a motorcycle, on 3 out of, I don't know, maybe 7 tries, the enemy car straight up bugged out and kept driving in circles and there was nothing I could do about it, but to die and restart the chapter. I have literally been flung out into the sky and died about 3 times during my whole playthrough, simply by driving on the tram tracks. I have died while vaulting over the security window in the Old Prison a couple of times as well. I've shot down a plane with Morello still in it, only to realize, that once I've caught up to the plane wreck and completed the mission - I have failed the mission. How? After said missions' cutscene I've had a death screen pop up with a simple ""You have been killed"", or whatever it says. So I went ahead and reloaded my last checkpoint (which was the beginning of the cutscene). Same thing. I tried it about 5 times, before I realized, that i probably have to replay the whole chapter again. A huge bummer, if you ask me. The ragdoll is messy and the movement is very clunky. You'll struggle to move from cover to cover.

Short version:
+ beautiful graphics, albeit I recommend turning off motion blur and turning on v-sync, otherwise the game acts weird sometimes
+ driving feels very nice
+ incredible story and attention to detail
+ really well done cinematics

- you can't stop the engine or use the turning signals
- gunfights are lackluster, basic and npcs feel very clunky
- no health bars for friendly npcs make them look like terminators
- plethora of gameplay bugs that will have you replay checkpoints/entire chapters
- driving and shooting is no challenge at all, feels too console-y on PC

--Great story. The story of Mafia 1 is already perfect. In addition, the developers added some extra details to the story and made it better.
--Wide range of difficulties. The gameplay is a lot easier than the old one if you just want to walk through it. On the other hand, it has the option to let you experience the hardcore gameplay from the original Mafia 1 if you want to. It also improved some outdated mechanisms from the old one.
--Stunning graphics. The graphics belong to a 2020 game and it is one of the best I’ve ever seen. It is so realistic that it would be hard for you to tell whether it is a CG or real-time cutscene.
--Great Optimization. It runs much smoother than the Mafia 3 for me. No frame drops have occurred during my gameplay.
--Excellent value. This is clearly one of the best games you can buy for 40 bucks. Especially for the ones who haven’t played the original version.

Cons:
Apart from some dialog changes that I don’t like, there aren't any, tbh.

If you were a fan of the original, Mafia 2 or just a fan of story driven games in general I would highly recommend. At the price of £35 on release it is a steal.

There's not to say the game has no flaws however. At Current outside of Story mode there is quite little else to do. There is a Free Roam included that has around 15 hidden bonus missions with unique rewards not dissimilar to the original's Free Ride Extreme Missions. 

This Free Roam does not allow you to enter the story's interiors or in fact many interiors at all because throughout the story and the Free Roam there is no monetary system, this means no shops or anything to rob from unlike the other games in the franchise (This is true to the original game) which honestly I'd have liked them to have added.

As an example to this there are petrol stations you can use but not go inside, it's just odd from a game released in 2020.

With that stated I would highly recommend Mafia: Definitive Edition, just don't think there's going to be much more than a Story for you to play here (At current anyway).

24,Mafia Definitive Edition,76717962,english,"I'm a huge fan of the original game and I think this remake is alright and worth buying, with a few buts, especially in the combat department.

The good:
+Graphics are great.
+The city is is very faithfully recreated and looks stellar, they also included the countryside which I'm very happy about.
+The story is still very good. Some of the story additions are nice and some characters (Sarah most of all) more fleshed out.
+Quite granular difficulty settings that should cover casuals as well as those looking for a bit of a challenge.
+Well optimized and I didn't run into any bugs.

The neutral:
~Driving physics are more arcadey, even on ""simulation"" mode.
~Some of the characters are quite significantly changed (especially the main trio). This might not suit everyone.
~Free ride and extreme free ride are now one mode.

The bad:
-The combat mechanics are TERRIBLE, both melee and shooting. The original game wasn't really stellar in this area either, but this is a new level of awful.
-Cut content and reduced length of the game: Most notably, Bertone's side quests are completely missing (replaced by special cars stuffed in secret locations in free ride). Especially the second half of the game gave me a weirdly ""compacted"" and rushed feeling. The original often made you drive home after a mission with the option to visit Bertone for a side quest and a new car as a reward. In this version, the mission just ends with a cutscene and the next one begins after a few seconds. Really weird pacing compared to the original.
-There are even fewer things to do in free ride than in the original (not even taxi ""missions""), which is a shame considering how beautiful the city is and how much time they probably spent making it.

26,Mafia Definitive Edition,76717864,english,"The original 2002 Mafia game is a classic and one of my all time favourite games. You'd be forgiven for thinking it would be an open world 'GTA-like' game, especially considering the sequels moved further in that direction. But while the original Mafia does have an expansive open world, it instead has the player play through more linear and story focused chapters, a with the open world acting as a backdrop. This made the world feel so much more alive and grounded. I think a lot of people might have expected the Definitive Edition to do away with this and go with the more modern open world formula, but thankfully it didn't. Don't get me wrong, I would like to see an open world Mafia game in the more classic setting, maybe as a prequel where you play as a young Salieri, but I'm glad they stayed true to the original.

The game's story is pretty much identical to the original's. Though there are a few instances where set pieces have been tweaked to make for a more epic sequence; a certain mission involving Morello plays out slightly differently. More time is spent with Tommy and Sarah too, which I appreciated. The added scenes help reinforce the characters' motivations, and makes for a more cohesive story. Speaking of the characters, its obvious that most of them have been re-imagined to some extent. Their identities are still the same, and they still act like they should, but I'll admit it is a little jarring at first to hear the very different voices and see the very different faces. That said, the new voice acting is absolutely fantastic. Tommy especially has had so much more life breathed into him. I could listen to his voice all day. Salieri too is another stand out performance. He's much more expressive and he really does exude that mob boss quality. That friendliness always armed with a certain threatening undertone. The facial animation is excellent too. This is where the game shines the brightest. The excellent new voice work and animation quality really allows the fantastic story to deliver in ways it couldn't before.

Next to the story, the second best thing about Mafia is driving around its fascinating world in wonderfully authentic cars. Thankfully the remake succeeds here even more than the original. I recommend playing in 'classic mode' because it gives the old fashioned cars the handling that they should have, and that just adds to the feeling of authenticity. The world is wonderfully crafted, with details everywhere that you could spend days enjoying. If you love the cars of this era you will love the variety and detail in this game. The only thing missing is a first person view mode that allows you to see inside the car.

While there isn't anything I would say is outright negative with this remake, there are couple aspects that could have been done a little better. First of all, the shooting is nothing special. Its not bad, but it could be more satisfying. Enemies seem to take one more shot to kill than they should, leaving them dangerously close to becoming bullet sponges. You don't really get much feedback when you shoot and kill enemies either, so it feels a little flat. Melee combat is pretty bland too, all it amounts to is whacking the enemy a few times and then finishing them off with a button prompt. Its the same every time and not particularly engaging. Second of all is the driving. While I loved how it felt, I can imagine many might find the driving in classic mode too frustrating, especially the infamous racing mission. 

Apart from these possible issues, I have nothing but praise for this remake. It even performs wonderfully. I never once noticed any frame drops, and don't think I saw a single graphical glitch throughout my playthrough. I had my worries after the release of Mafia II's remaster, but to say I was pleasantly surprised would be an understatement. Mafia: Definitive Edition is exactly what I was hoping for. Whether for fans of the original or for newcomers, I have no problem recommending this excellent remake.

Pros:
- Excellent authenticity and attention to detail
- Fantastic voice acting and character design
- Faithful to the original story yet improved where necessary

Cons:
- Lacklustre shooting
- Lazy melee

TLDR; 
Forgettable experience. Style over substance.

As stated by many, the Mafia: Definitive edition looks pretty. It really does. And its a really good shooter. Even though I thought I knew the city very well from the original game, The artists made sure it does not look anything like it. Sure, the resemblance to certain places is there, like the bridges, the underpass, or the church in downtown. but the city has changed it's looks so much, that i was able to get lost in it. BUT, the game is pretty much style over substance. 
The game experience is forgettable. Even while playing on hardest difficulty, I didn't really encounter a situation, where i would be forced to start over, which i quite liked. The race mission was probably one of the most restarted ones, because I didn't quite come to terms with handling of the car. On mission design - the missions are designed well, but the level layout felt too narrow - Going from A to B, there is no way you can get lost, even in final segments of missions like You Lucky Bastard, where, in original game, you had the whole port at your disposal, meaning, you could go anywhere in the port, and had great freedom on smaller playgrounds. In the remake, it felt more like going through locked out corridors. Why were the quests for Lucas cut? One of the aspects and rewards of Mafia was seeing your car collection grow as you progressed. Why was the inventory cut? The original made sense, but here, you are allowed to take one big weapon, and a sidearm, no reason for that other than probably dev laziness. Also, throughout the game I didn't feel like I progressed toward something, and that's because of the writing. Seriously.

[Potential spoiler]
The game dialog is very well dubbed, the actors really gave their best in this, and it shows. However, its the script that has issues. Big issues. From the beggining (the moment detective Norman walks through the door to the table in the restaurant) I thought that something just didn't click. The dialog had me in tears laughing, not by how funny or well done it is, it was because of cringe. If i was to take a look at that same scene from the original game, it's characters had very well explained motives, (Thomas Angelo, a mafia outlaw, who is determined to put the entire mafia behind bars for his safety, and the safety of his family, and the detective, who didn't care, and had his own stance to his situation, but at the end of the story, Tommy's testimony is solid, and thats why he helps him.) and it was all done through concise and short dialogs. You understood very easily what was going on.

In the remake however, the character acts cringey and out of context. (Seriously, why the fuck did he say, that he doesn't even have a dollar for the coffee? I thought that this guy was a well paid mafia henchman, did he purchase a Geforce 3080 from eBay or something???) And Mr. Norman feels like he isn't even supposed to be a detective to me.
[/Potential spoiler]
The original game had a message. A message that was conveyed very clearly. About lives not being dictated by Book of Laws, but people. People you love, people you hate. People that are your boss, or your subordinate. And in the end, it could be your best friend, or another gangster, who is a tool of your own demise. In the remake, the epilogue was a mess and nonsensical gibberish about family values. And its not just an epilogue that has this problem. 
The biggest change from the original, and the bit i liked the most was in the character development. Be it Tom's relationship with Sarah, the chatter during driving segments in the missions among your fellow gangsters, or just gossip of the other pedestrians.
The original was lackluster in this, but it didnt seem like an issue. This was a nice icing on the cake.

The cops are dumb and feel like they are there for the neccessity of being there. Nuffsaid.

The music is pretty, but like the whole game, forgettable. There isn't a theme that would stand out. Original Mafia had a few music pieces that played throughout the cutscenes and gameplay, and districts had their own tunes, and i remember each and every one of them. All of those are replaced by the car radio, which also cover news from the city, and from the era. It can be turned off if you so desire.

When it comes to bugs i didn't come across anything that would break my game too much, though, in the occasion of loading a checkpoint due to me dying, i sometimes thought that the game loaded me further down the mission than i actually was. Happened to me twice, i think. And once i opened a door to a room, walked over the chair and died instantly due to an environment collision. Also i had this weird bug that would just freeze the game for a solid 30 seconds, but alt+tab out and back to the window resolved the issue, as i realized further into the game.

Conclusion:
I really want to like this game, i really do. I bought this product for nostalgia and out of pure curiosity. Where the original made an impact, this feels like an unfinished painting of Mona Lisa, or that same painting but just in black and white.
Whoever wrote the script clearly didn't understand the point that the original was trying to bring across. The final straw that broke the camels back is the fact that the devs didn't bother too much with side content.",1601307866,1601307866,FALSE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,251,1,734,734,734,1601301035

[h1] Information / Review Deutsch [/h1]

Mafia: Definitive Edition ist ein klassisches Action-Spiel, welches von Hangar 13 entwickelt wurde.

[h1] Gameplay / Geschichte [/h1]

Mafia: Definitive Edition versetzt den Spieler nach Lost Heaven (dt. verlorener Himmel), eine fiktive US-amerikanische Großstadt im Stile des New York Citys der 30er Jahre. In Lost Heaven regieren zwei Mafia-Familien die Unterwelt, die Salieris und die Morello-Familie.

In einer einleitenden Videosequenz sieht man den Protagonisten Tommy, der sich mit einem Detective der Polizei namens Norman trifft. Tommy möchte aus der Mafia aussteigen und bietet sich daher als Kronzeuge an, wenn ihm im Gegenzug Straffreiheit und eine neue Identität garantiert werden. Die Geschichte wird nun in Rückblenden vom Spieler durchgespielt, zwischendurch zeigen immer wieder Videosequenzen das fortschreitende Gespräch zwischen Tommy und Norman.

Thomas „Tommy“ Angelo, der Protagonist, gerät als Taxifahrer zwischen die Fronten, als er von zwei Mitgliedern der Salieris gezwungen wird, diesen als Fluchtfahrer auszuhelfen. So lernt er Paulie und Sam kennen und zieht sich gleichzeitig den Zorn der Morellos zu. Seine anfängliche Abneigung gegen die Mafia überwindet er nach einem Angriff auf ihn, und er bittet Don Salieri um Hilfe. Der Don erscheint als freundlicher und hilfsbereiter Mann, er bietet Tommy einen Job an und garantiert ihm Sicherheit. Tommy wird nun in den Mafia-Alltag eingeführt, die ersten Missionen drehen sich um Einschüchterung und das Eintreiben von Schutzgeld. Die anfänglichen Skrupel werden von seinen neuen Freunden schnell zerstreut, die Erfolge und das daraus gewonnene Lebensgefühl wiegen schwerer.

Gone are the silent drives from point A to point B, now you have proper conversations that add more to the world and characters, or better yet you can skip the drives entirely if that is your thing. This game has a good balance of choices when it comes to difficulty, I recommend playing on the classic mode, so you can feel the frustration that I felt when playing the original way back when. The combat is one the biggest and best improvements upon the original, I felt that Hanger 13 never had issues on this front as Mafia 3's combat loop was very fun, and that transfers over here too. I genuinely felt like a badass in this game, but man did it feel like I was still scrambling to survive since I was playing on classic mode, which meant that you would typically go down in about 3-4 shots or 1 good headshot (be prepared to see the death screen a lot). There is a very basic melee system, it feels very last-gen, but it does get the job done, and I imagine that this game didn't have the craziest budget, so it is understandable why it is this way, and its still leaps and bounds better than what we had in the original. Now the best part of this remake and what was need the most for an almost 20 year old game, is the graphics. This game looks drop dead gorgeous at times, and its surprisingly a very well optimized game too, the best part of the graphics definitely has to be the lighting and the reflections.

Now it isn't a perfect remake, there are some downsides to this. The world interactivity is non-existent, like Mafia 3, you can not turn light switches on/off, flush the toilet, turn the sink on/off, etc. Which I felt has always been a big part of the Mafia's franchise identity, and is also severe downgrade in my opinion since in the original you were able to do this, and in fact the sequel, Mafia 2, improved upon the interactivity by letting you visit stores, eat at restaurants, get drunk, change your clothes, customize and upgrade your cars, the list goes on. The main character Tommy Angelo, also changed a little bit, in the original he was a lot more grounded, since he was just a measly taxi cab driver before he joined the family, he generally tended to be the moral compass for the family. In the remake, he is for the most part the same, but some of the new dialogue seemed very out of character and made him come off as a bit more hardened then he actually is despite not even being in the family when said dialogue was being spoken. But for the most part, and what anyone can hope in a remake of a beloved cult classic, is that is has no major glaring issues, fixes most of the major turn off's from the original, runs completely fine, and has a very fun and satisfying combat loop.

Some bugs were spotted but it's not serious.
Only some things like unhidable Objective mark and shitty melee fight (I wish developers bring back Mafia 2 Melee fight), auto lock on in car shooting (seriously, why this thing remains) were bad. i guess?

As a classic player that really loved Mafia original, I wasn't a fan about changed character for first sight, but change was little and acceptable.
I'm not saying about acting. acting was good. But only thing Tommas now behave like badass noire man unlike OG.
Iconic tracks such as Belleville are removed, oh, Lucas missions too, sad but acceptable.
And Free Ride Extreme, FRR is survived with some deleted cars! this is not bad.
I hope the developers bring back those nice cars.

A VERY good remake of a masterpiece!
[hr][/hr]
Mafia: Definitive Edition is the remake of Mafia: The City of Lost Heaven, from 2002. Having just finished the game (story mode), I'll try to cover some of main aspects of the game in my opinion and its differences from the original.

[h1]Story[/h1]
The original game had one of the most brilliant stories in gaming back when it was launched. Through flashbacks, we get to know (and play as) Tommy Angelo, a taxi driver at the wrong place and in the wrong time, and how he gets dragged into the 1930s mob. [u]The good news:[/u] The remake doesn't change that.
If you have played the original, It will probably feel a bit different. Maybe you still remember the story pretty well, so it won't have the surprise element (It happended with me, I had replayed the original only 3 years ago). A bit of the mandatory driving through the city in some missions was replaced with cutscenes. I loved driving through Lost Heaven in the Original, so I have mixed feeling for this. On one hand, it helps keeping the pace of the story. On the other hand, it won't make the players fall in love with the city details so much. Also, 18 years ago the city exploration probably would feel as something more innovative than today anyways, so it was probably for the best.

[h1]Audio[/h1]
The original game had an excellent soundtrack. The music followed pretty well the story and also helped characterize the different districts of Lost Heaven (for each one there was a different music). The soundtrack in the remake is completely new, keeping only the main/intro theme. Instead of the district music thing, you have the radio stations. If you played the original, maybe you will miss the original soundtrack. I missed it, but I actually believe it is more due to nostalgia, because the new soundtrack is excellent. Also, the radio has an important role in the game. In some key missions, you will be able to listen to the news and keep track on the impacts of your previous acts, or even the impacts of the external world like the economics and the war.
Ps. If you don't know, they wouldn't be able to use the original soundtrack anyways due to rights.

[h1]Graphics[/h1]
As expected in a remake 18 years after the original, there will be a [u]huge[/u] difference. Back in 2002, the graphics were very good (apart from the tress lol), but they haven't aged very well. Now we have modern graphics like you could expect in a AAA game. The city is beautiful and textures/models are very good.
The only thing I complain a bit is the balance in brightness: After a some hours playing, a few places were too dark (like unable to see anything) in a specific mission and I had to change the brightness setting in game. 
Having built a very good new PC this year, I am unable to evaluate the performance of the game on older rigs. But at least I can say I was very happy to play, on launch day, with everything maxed out, and no visible bugs or crashes at all.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
If there was something a bit clunky in the original game, it would be certainly the controls. Not that they were terrible, but it just didn't flow well with the rest of the game. In this remake, it flows perfectly (as you would expect in a modern AAA game). Walking, shooting, driving... Everything plays right. A good addition, for example, was the hability to cover in shooting so you need to die much less. Actually, if you have played the original game, this remake will be much easier. Not only on shooting, but driving, the police and even that damn race were a lot easier in the remake. I completed the game on classic difficulty with a controller and it was not that huge challenge. But for me it doesn't make the game easy in a bad way, it's a very good game but not so hard as the original.
Another [expected] addition are collectibles. You will have plenty, and it can provide many more hours for those who like to get 100% on the games.

[h1]Last Thoughts[/h1]
If you haven't played the original game, I totally recommend playing this remake. It will probabaly not have the same impact the original had back in 2002, but it is totally worth playing.
If you have played the original game, it is a very good way to revisit Lost Heaven.

[h1]Česká recenze[/h1]

Hra zcela určitě předčila očekávání, určitě se nenaplnily obavy mnoha, že hru převodem do enginu Mafie 3 vývojáři slušně řečeno ""podělají"".

Na Klasickou obtížnost je hra doopravdy těžká, jako si pamatuji původní před téměř 20 lety, místy někdy možná i víc. Tommy není žádný akční hrdina, a když se do něj někdo trefí, je to na ukazateli života hned pořádně poznat (nižší obtížnosti nabízejí regenerující životy, na Klasickou se dostanete maximálně na 10% a zbytek musíte doufat, že narazíte na lékárničku). Ale skoro pořád je zachováno staré dobré pravidlo originálu, že když někoho trefíte do hlavy, tak jde k zemi, na žádné ""bullet sponge"" nepřátele nenarazíte. Myslím, že většina výjimek je pouze důsledkem mého mizerného míření, protože nutno dodat, že zbraně se někdy doopravdy dost ""houpou"", obzvlášť při hře na myší (na ovladači to tolik poznat není, bez ohledu na nastavení aim assist). Přestřelkám se dostalo z novějších dílů systému krytí, kdy se lze schovat za překážky, a střílet nepřátele zpoza nich. Ovšem umělá inteligence nepřátel má úplně stejné možnosti a počítá s nimi, takže se vás z krytu snaží vyhnat jak tím, že vás oběhnou, nebo že po vás hodí hořícím molotovem, a samozřejmě se sami kryjí, a musíte čekat, že vylezou, nebo je trefit do něčeho co čouhá zpoza krytu.

Kromě krytí hra také dostala poněkud základní ""stealth"" systém, kdy je možné se za nepřátele připlížit a potichu je poslat k zemi jednou ránou. Ovšem řada protivníků se takto nachytat nenechá a jedná se tak o velice občasnou situaci. Ale i tak lze některé mise v příběhu dohrát ""pokradmu"" (i když pak stejně všichni hovoří o ""masakru"", ale to lze očekávat)

Klasická noční můra mnoha hráčů originálu, závod, je na Klasickou obtížnost pořádné peklo, nejen pro to, že v remaku se nenachází stará dobrá zkratka, kterou šlo závod obejít. Ale i tak lze po mnoha (a mnoha) pokusech zvítězit i poctivě. Čili nutno říct, že ovládání vozidel se také velice povedlo zachovat tak jak bylo.

Co se týká příběhu a postav, hře se v předělávce dostalo taky hodně dobře a s citem k originálu udělanému rozšíření osobností mnoha hlavních i vedlejších postav, což pak určitým scénám dává mnohem větší dopad. Některé mise se taktéž dočkaly rozšíření a úprav (kde například lze využít nový stealth systém), ale opět vše je udělané se vším možným respektem k originálu. Také byla doplněna řada referencí na další díly, velice často je zmíněno město Empire Bay, a podobně.

Jediným podstatným problémem hry je, že příběh letí kupředu raketovou rychlostí, a není tak možnost se skoro vůbec nadechnout a prozkoumat město Lost Heaven. Čili žádné ""zastav se za Lucasem Bertonim pro, jak by řekl Ralph, ně-ně-jakou pe-pě-pěknou m-m-mašinku"", a podobně. Sice to možné je, ale i tak je vidět, že toto vše bylo zdánlivě delegováno do režimu Volné (a ze Salieriho přístupné Extrémní) Jízdy, kde také lze najít řadu věcí do ""sbírky"", ať už brakové detektivy, komiksy, nebo kartičky se známým gangstery (řada z nich jde ale najít i v rámci příběhu, naštěstí šikovně zvýrazněné na minimapě). Pak je zde pár poněkud zbytečností, jako například žlutý kosočtverec, ukazující kam má člověk směřovat (plně by stačilo ukazovat čáru na minimapě), ale ty jdou docela snadno ignorovat.

Pak je zde otázka překladu. Velice lze ocenit návrat řady původních herců tam, kde to bylo možné, a u ostatních velká snaha se původním přiblížit. Ale i přes to lze narazit na pár problémů, které se týkají replik, které herci odříkávají. Zmizelo pár obzvlášť ikonických scének, které se v české komunitě staly legendárními (především v misi ""Radši si zvykej""). Sice je ""duše"" scény zachována, ale škoda že ty hlášky nejsou jak byly. Několik vět také působí, jako by byly přeloženy velice strojově slovo od slova, a zůstala jim anglická skladba vět. Ale i přes to se jedná opět o dobrou práci a je vidět snaha originál zachovat. Trochu dost zamrzelo to, že není udělaný překlad rádiových stanic, které v remaku nahrazují hudební podkres jednotlivých čtvrtí, a vesele si melou anglicky o vašich činnostech, nebo o světovém dění (například Mnichovská dohoda).

95,Mafia Definitive Edition,76590579,english,"It is a good game but a bad Mafia I remake.

I can't say that the game is bad on its own merits. The graphics look good, the story is kinda OK. It has problems, but if Mafia I didn't exist and it was just a new game it would've been an OK game. Not a masterpiece but not garbage either. If you are looking for something to play, Mafia Definitive edition is worth its money.

However, Mafia I does exist and if you just like I played and loved it, this remake might disappoint you. The main problem I see is that they lost lots of things which were making Mafia a great game. The story and the characters are objectively worse now. The original Tommy Angelo was a victim of circumstance. He didn't want the life of a gangster and became one slowly step by step. To him, it wasn't like winning a lottery. On the contrary, the new Tommy likes it from the beginning. He likes the idea of earning some easy money. He likes the idea of revenge. He wants to have revenge (Molotov Party) not to impress the Don. Later in the game, he volunteers to do dirty job multiple times. He [spoiler]burned alive[/spoiler] Sergio [spoiler]Morello[/spoiler]. Can you imagine the old Tommy doing it?

Some of the dialogues were changed for no apparent reason. For example, in the old Mafia, Tommy showed the photo of Peppone, Salieri and Morello to the cop and said that Salieri and Morello were friends and killed Peppone and divided the city. This photo forced him to think about friendship and safety among the members of Mafia. In the remake, however, it was the other way round. The cop showed the photo and said that Peppone has drowned while was swimming hence Salieri and Morelo had to divide the city. The story lost one of the motivators for Tommy to turn on Salieri and got nothing in return. He didn't kill the girl in the Corleone Hotel because Sam asked him to do so. And diamonds were replaced with something else in those cigars from Scorsese import.

I can't say that I particularly liked Mafia 3, but it has an extremely well presented main story and well-made characters. They looked alive and convincing. The cut scenes were interesting and fun to watch. Probably the best in the past many years. I hoped to see something similar here. But the characters look and sound grotesque. Especially Paulie. The actor playing him (Jeremy Luke) is fine. IRL he looks OK, he sounds OK. But in the game, Paulie is an unlikeable parody. You can expect this voice in a show for small kids, not in a serious game for adults. The same goes with Sam but it is not half as bad.

The city looks beautiful. But it is not the city we knew. It is a similar one, kind of a brother. It has a similar structure but it is not the same. Salieri's bar is one block away from the old place. Hoboken became Holbrook, Oak Hill became Beech Hill and so on. To be clear, I'm not talking only about the names, although, I don't understand why they renamed them. I mean, the city is similar but different. It doesn't give the feeling of ""I've been here many times, I know every corner"". It is just a city some parts of which look kinda sort of probably almost familiar sometimes.

In my opinion, they shouldn't have made this remake. They should have made ""Mafia 4: Return to Lost Heaven"" with a new story and new characters and happening sometime not so long after the original game. This would've allowed them to change the city (time has passed and some rebuilding/reconstruction happened), introduce new characters and new game mechanics, visit old but new places and so on.

I chose to recommend this game, but only because it is not too bad. As a remake it is terrible.

If you expect the full package with unique, non-arcady game design and curated attention to detail in game mechanics, you will get frustrated and disappointed.
I hate to give this game thumbs down as it looks like Mafia but unfortunately doesn't play like one.

(+) Game looks presentable.
(+) Level artists did a great job updating the whole world including the area outside of the city.
(+) The vehicle models are amazing!
(+) Cinematics are nice.
(+) The driving on simulation settings is great. (I have not played the game on arcade settings so no comment on that.) The cars have weight, are a joy to drive leisurely around town, they differ from each other. Huge plus, if you prefer driving on a keyboard, it is very well implemented. (Originally, this was briefly mentioned as a concern but once I experienced many vehicles and weather settings and rate ONLY driving [that is ignoring the arcady ramming mechanic, collisions, shooting, etc.], this needs to be pointed out as a positive as someone put a lot of work into this.)

(~) There are changes in the original layout of the map. Some are minor (added streets, pavements), some major (location of the Salieri's bar is changed, most of the traffic lights are missing).
(~) Some missions were slightly altered. Some story was added. In many cases, it has a positive effect on the game, not always though. You be the judge.
(~) I only experienced minor bugs: traffic stops completely working at certain tram stops; objective triggers fail or characters get stuck (reloading checkpoint fixes it); plugging audio devices while the game is running often breaks the game audio; a cutscene might start without  a sound; small animation glitches; dead bodies often get stuck in dying animation poses (instead of dead poses), bullet shells get stuck in the ""air"" after reloading; many spatial sound triggers are misplaced leading to many sounds coming from incorrect directions.
(~) Music is completely changed. I'll be a heretic and say I prefer the new music more to the original one but I'm sure that's not the case for many people so again, you be the judge.

(-) The key people in the development should be required to play the original game through and through to be even considered for the job. This evidently did not happen, so this a result of incompetent management trying to steer a ship they never once boarded before. Mafia III story all over again.
(-) Runs on an old and poorly updated Fusion engine which was flawed in Mafia 3, yet they decided to use it again (aggressive LOD popping, weird lighting and graphical glitches, global illumination takes too long to adjust, anti-aliasing is not as horrendous as in Mafia 3 but is still broken)
(-) Game design, the crown jewel of the original game and the very base of the series, is (like in Mafia III) atrocious. A complete miss. Charging cars; exploding barrels in a wooden barn; HUD with obscene navigation icons you can't turn off; fake environmental events to dumb down car chases (if, at least, they were hidden and offering themselves naturally by the way they look instead of that horrible icon as if the players were complete morons); press dodge when the HUD tells you to win a fistfight; glowing objects on the ground that you can pick up (because HUD telling you is not apparently enough); kill-confirmed crosshair feedback; hard auto-aim lock-on on enemy cars while shooting when driving; non-existent enemy AI. This a sample of many fatally flawed decisions no competent person should make. No figuring stuff out on your own anymore, no excitement in playing with the game and discovering its boundaries. All the aspects why Mafia was different than GTA, Watchdogs, True Crime or Driver series (or any other city open world for that matter) are gone and replaced by these generic, lazy and cheap mechanics making it an average game at the very best.
(-) Missions and part of missions are missing. Driving sessions between missions are removed even when you specifically set in options not to do that.
(-) Story and the dialogues (and their meaning) have been altered and mostly for the worse for no apparent reason.
(-) Horrible choice for many main characters who now have generic looks you can't remember.
(-) Combat animations are recycles from Mafia 3. They don't fit the story/character, they don't fit the weapons (molotov bottle is the most bizarre example), they're generally not very well done.
(-) Customization of player's input is a mess. You have no indication what keys can be shared between different actionmaps unless you map something and a warning pops up (beginner's UI design mistake). You can't customize controller input (only switch between two presets). You can't share keyboard and gamepad or steering wheel input. You cannot map extra buttons on your mouse.
(-) You cannot turn off HUD.
(-) Alt-tabbing is very slow, sometimes breaks the game. Game has issues with multiple displays and I didn't find the option to run the game in windowed-borderless state.
(-) The settings are very limited which is a disgrace for a game that was originally developed for a PC.
(-) The game design, a complete opposite to the original, holds your hand the whole time and so much it offends your intellect.

Hangar 13 should stop abusing the Mafia brand and move on. They make nice assets but tremendously lack a creative and game design leadership.

8,Mafia Definitive Edition,76556772,english,"TLDR; Mindless and soulless cover shooter, that have been ""modernized"" by people who don't care about videogames.
This game is a shallow parody on the original. Immersive gameplay elements like long drives after the missions, getting weapons at Vinni's before each mission, getting taught by Ralphi how to steal new cars etc.  were removed. Mission themselves were butchered and a lot of scenes are completely missing. All of the game has been dumbed down to go from point A to point B, shoot some guys, repeat, and it is all RUSHED, the entire bloody game is rushed. It is way shorter than original, all the claims that the remake expands on the original is flat out false advertisement... there are pointless new scenes that add nothing of substance, and all of them combined are hardly top 5 minutes of cutscenes of your woman being mad at you. At no point in the game I was immersed in the world as I was when playing original. 
No original music except the main theme.
Graphics is good though. All the devs needed to do is copy paste the original with better graphics.
It is a mediocre game, and a horrible remake. Wait for 50% sale.
P.S No turn indicators, though 18 year old original game managed to implement it.

UPDATE:
I've been replaying the original game... well my friends, all of the dialogs in this remake are completely changed, some of the events and dialogs flipped to make one side or a person look bad.. it is like a toddler made the script for the remake... removed any mentioning of America and christianity that were in the original (personally I could not care less, but it shows what the agenda of the devs is), added absurd mentioning that swearing is bad and not cool... Are you bloody serious??!!! 
Missing missions, no freeride extreme, completely changed narrative and dialogs, leftist propaganda, dumbed down gameplay... losing tires pretty much does not affect the driving even on ""simulation"" driving setting, if fuel tank is hit the car does not lose fuel, no refueling clerks (guess it's offensive now), characters changed both visually and behaviorally. 
I honestly don't get the amount of positive feedback this remake gets... it is one of the worst remakes ever made... because it changes the narrative ideas of the original, takes away gameplay mechanics, and adds nothing. This is not a remake, this is reimagining to fit into the modern ""right"" and convenient values to sell this pile of trash to the maximum amount of people.

Fairly faithful to the original but it has left out quite a bit of features and content. The game is very mixed as the theme/atmoshpere of the game does not really match the gameplay at certain points.

Basically all missions have been reworked to be similar to cover shooters so you can always tell when you are about to be in a shootout. Most of the shootouts in each chapter happen at the same points in the original but they have added many more enemies to the point that it feels like every other modern day shooter.

Some driving and exploration objectives seem to have been removed or reworked to skip you through the game a bit quicker. All alternative objectives seem to have also been removed from the game. Along with any optional stuff you can find in the original.

Even with these changes it was still nice to play through it again. The game looks absolutely beautiful no matter where you look. Nearly all cutscenes are perfectly lit that you could mistake them for real life in some scenes. Game is also optimized near perfect as I've experienced no performance issues or any major bugs/glitches so far.

Vehicles/Voice acting sound great but everything else is rather meh. They have included the original mafia soundtrack as well so thats a plus. End credits play some Ice Cube Hip Hop Track for some strange reason (completely out of place/time). Should have just played the damn theme song instead.

The gameplay is the same as mafia 3 but slightly altered to fit the time period of the vehicles and Tommy as he isn't military like Clay. New vehicle physics feel great and make driving around pretty fun/satisfying. They also have the option to enable manual transmission with clutch just like in Mafia 1.

Story is basically 1:1 with the original with only a few slight alterations. Mostly for the better. However I don't ever see myself playing through this game again as most of the replayability compared to the original is gone. Playing through the original over n over was fun because you always had optional stuff you could do during chapters/missions. Here though all of that is removed and you are sent down the story only path.

Such a gorgeous game, it's a shame the gameplay and story are so mediocre. The linear storytelling leaves a lot to be desired and feels a bit old fashioned. It's hard not to compare it to similar games like GTA which offer at least some RPG elements, but it's important to note this isn't an RPG and the original game is nearly twenty years old.

Seeing this masterpiece of a game, it brought back so many good memories of me screwing around with mods, or doing the story for the 40th time.

They have altered the story here and there, but it definitely brought you more into the story.
The changes they made actually even make the veterans of the mafia series think twice.
The end of the story had me on the edge of my seat.

Conclusion:
This game is great! it may have some bugs but mafia 1 had plenty of bugs aswell.
You won't hear me complain.
Everyone thats considering buying this game. its worth every penny!

A heavily story driven game that sucks you in!

I don't get it. What the hell did you guys do to the story? I actually smiled at the end because Tommy Angelo was dead. I spent half my play time trying to drown the Don in the river, or run him over with the car. I was annoyed I couldn't kill Frank. I tried to explode the car Paulie gets in after Ralphies intro. Good job Paulie, bully the guy with a disability. Makes you that much more badass and manly - and yes, I looked up how he spoke to Ralphie in the original to compare. These people, every single one of them in this game, are awful. It's a shame too, because I liked all of them in the original.

Alright, alright. It's not all bad news. The graphics are wonderful which is good because at 15 frames a second I had plenty of time to admire them - yes, my system is quite out of date I know. Uh... I suppose the city feels a lot more bustling in this version too. A bit more variety in what the NPCs was doing. I'm still trying to work out why the city was still bustling at 1:00am while I was driving a racecar through it, or why so many pedestrians were out in a fairly minor thunderstorm. But still, nice atmosphere.

Now onto what made me dislike this game so much, save for the obvious reasons of it feeling like a completely new game with a couple of pieces of the original dialogues shoehorned into for nostalgia reasons. This played like the newer mafias. Every mission was linear. Quicksaves every 10 or so meters. No real need for skill 'cause you'll die anyway. May as well just brute force it until the mission is done, what with the general ambush tactics the maps employ at a constant rate. I also couldn't really understand the logic in it. A good example of this is in the church. Who brings a Molotov to a funeral? Hell, who even brings bottles of hard liquor into the funeral service to even make them on a whim? And no, communion wine will not make a good Molotov.

The general enemy AI was infuriating as well. The thing is, Tommy wasn't a soldier, and that's been made fairly clear in the way he uses his weapons and cover. It's pretty novice methods on his behalf. But man, ALL of the enemies he encounters must have just come from the navy seals because each one of them had the ability to take multiple bullets, and yet still fire dead eye headshots at the player while their guns were pointing at the sky from the recoil of being shot. After much frustration from this, I worked out that taking cover was a bad idea, rather to stand behind a wall so that the crosshair was just out far enough to shoot the enemy. Actually, come to think of it, that's exactly the way to do it in the original Mafia. Good job there guys. That was faithful to the original.

Then there's the traffic. Why must these cars pull out in front of oncoming traffic to make a turn. I don't think I had anywhere near as many T-bone collisions in the original mafia. There didn't seem to be a way to avoid it either. Staying the course would just mean the other car would keep going. Try to swerve around it would make the AI stop in its tracks so you'd collect it there too. Makes driving the bikes infuriating. The car control mechanics were unbearable too. I couldn't stand the racing sequence and how scripted it was - those who have played it will probably know what I mean. Go anywhere near the accelerator trigger and you'd just spin out no matter what the car was. Breathe on the brakes and your tires would lock up. I am willing to put this down to the settings I had and that I was using a controller... but man did I not like the driving. All the cars felt the same.

I could go on, but there'll be too much negativity and very little positivity if I do. I think my issue with this is that I started this series with the original Mafia, and since then Mafia 2, 3 and this just hasn't seemed to match it. And yes, I do still play the original and for all it's flaws and all its limitations, man does it still run rings around the rest of the lineup. Well, for me anyway.

I guess at the end of the day, it's a bit like the new Land Rover Defender, or the new Jeep Grand Wagoneer, or for that matter most of the movie or TV revivals. They're just made for a new generation of people who expect something different to the originals without ever really knowing what the originals were about. And I think like these things, this will find success in that. But I also think that in the same way, it won't quite have the staying power of the originals. Because the guy who wants too much risks losing absolutely everything. Of course, the guy who wants too little from life, might not get anything at all. See! I can inappropriately shoehorn quotes in as well.

EDIT: Now that I've finished this game,
I didn't like it. (I played it on Classical Difficulty) Some of the missions felt down right unfair, and would shift from shooty game to sit behind cover game, since health recovery is nearly non-existent. There were health/grenade drops everywhere in missions that didn't need them, and sparse when they were [b]really[/b] needed.

The story itself was pretty alright, but felt disconnected at parts, but I can understand why given the context of the Intermezzo scenes with the cop. [spoiler]Also seeing Vito and Joe at the end was nice, obviously[/spoiler] I know they couldn't stray too far from the source material, and the game itself suffers from it. I feel like there was more the game could have explored with the city and it's crime.

I really liked this game overall. The story was really really good and the characters were amazing. Its hard to find a game where you genuinely become invested in the story nowadays so it was awesome to see that. Besides that, the world was beautiful and the mechanics were pretty good as well.

But there were also a lot of things I didn't like. I get that its a remake of the original and obviously a game from 2002 isn't going to be as good as the games that are released today. But I don't understand why the devs left a lot of stuff out that are pretty run-of-the-mill with games of this level nowadays.

It would have been so easy to make this game open-world. They do have an option where you can just drive around and do whatever, but why not make that into the actual game? Also, theres pretty much no side quests, if you don't count gathering collectibles. The side quests could have been so cool for the time period, too! I think it would have been super cool to go around this 1930's world and go to a store to change outfits, maybe go to a speakeasy, explore locations that don't necessarily have to do with the main mission.

But as I said before, I did really like the game. After the final scene where Tommy is watering his lawn, I audibly went ""wow"". I definitely enjoyed it but did wish there was more to offer.

99,Mafia Definitive Edition,76695093,english,"I rarely write reviews, but I feel compelled for this one. 

TL;DR is that this version of the game is pretty damn good but I don't feel it holds up to the original. That said, the original is kinda a tough play through at this point. 

I felt like the Original had a richer experince interacting with the world. Cars ran out of gas, you had to obey traffic laws. It's sorta present here, I was pretty happy the first star wanted level I got I pulled over and bribed the cop just like I remembered.... but it ran hollow because in this version of the game you don't actually have money to keep track of. Ditto for the traffic laws, they'll get on your ass about speeding but I can't recall a single traffic light or stop sign the whole game. 

That said, I was 14 when the original came out. I'm now 31, with responsibilities and a full time job. In terms of time management for me, it was nice to just be able to motor through the story. One of my biggest pet peeves these days in open world games is having to go waypoint to waypoint for the next mission. Mafia avoids a lot of that, missions and cutscenes just come at you one after another. After trying, frustratingly to get into Red Dead Redemption and spending most of my play time riding to the next mission this was such a welcoming edition in Mafia. 

Everything else about it is great, the city looks awesome. The voice acting is top notch. The car handling is different than most games, but once I got use to it I really liked it. Cars and Bikes feel and steer heavy in this game, in a way thats very satisfying once you master it and can pull off drifts around corners. I could only complain that the shooting/cover mechanics are very basic, but they work well, I just found myself wishing I had some sort of powerup to freshing things up. Like a Bullet Time/Time Dilation. Popping someone in the skull always feels satisfying. 

It's a strong recomendation for me, but I would get it on a sale. I'd also still say playing the orignal Mafia is worth it too, just for the odds and ends they didn't bother to include.",1601268198,1601268198,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,413,12,757,757,757,1601266030

20,Mafia Definitive Edition,76692520,english,"Solid remake of a classic action RPG. There are legitimate grievances with some of the cut content and plot shuffling to accommodate it. The impact of that will depend on if you've played the original. All I can say is that I enjoyed the game for what it is. Mafia came out before open world games were truly ""open world"" and the game reflects that. It's a linear game that takes place within an open world. The Free Roam option is an entirely separate part that is accessed from the main menu. Otherwise you are railroaded into playing story mission after story mission. This works because the main story is well written, acted, and delivered. If you enjoy mob movies like the Godfather, Casino, Goodfellas, The Irishman, then you'll love this game. The shooting is decent and the sound/music is phenomenal.

There are only a few grievances I would make to this game. First is that the driving is hideous. It feels like I'm riding a cement block with wheels. Every car handles terribly, which is probably accurate to 1930s cars. Getting into chases with police is frustrating. Some cars have such awful acceleration that the police kill you before you even reach 15mph. Which leads me into my next complaint: the health system. This game has a health bar ala 0-100 HP points. When you are going through levels there are a finite number of health packs scattered around the map fixed to walls. This can lead to unfortunate situations where you make a mistake, lose most of your health, and have to rely on the auto regen to 20% until you can find a health pickup. I don't like this system in shooters. I end up just sitting behind cover until my health regens to 20% then popping up for a few shots then ducking down again. Rinse a repeat for all shooting sections. I prefer the CoD or Halo system of regenerating health to max after a few seconds of not being hit. It makes the gunplay less tedious and allows you to be more aggressive which is much more fun than camping behind cover.

All in all this is a solid remake of a beloved game. The original Mafia hasn't aged as well as Mafia 2 (which is even better than this game) and is less accessible for modern audiences. This brings Mafia back into the modern age, and it's done brilliantly. As for the price, I think $40 is a little too much just for this game. I beat the story in 9 hours. $30 would be a more appropriate price imo. However, I purchased the Mafia Trilogy pack for $60. That is a good price. We'll discount Mafia 3 because that game sucks, so $30 each for this game and Mafia 2. That's a good deal, and it's even better when it goes on sale.",1601262729,1601262729,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,470,54,553,553,553,1601174840
21,Mafia Definitive Edition,76692100,english,"so i'll say from the start i am a HUGE fan of this series and i played the 2002 original and omg did i burn my life away there playing it. the game is great , but...not perfect.
The story was ....well , it was ok i guess. i mean the story is short.. and for a AAA title game that's in my personal opinion is rather pathetic.
So i beat this game and i took my sweet A** time doing it and it only took me 10 hours.
I'm certain that if i skipped the drives and played this game in a rush ; i figure i could knock this game out in about 8-9 hours.
Speed runs are never my thing. so i'l give my thoughts...

GOOD :
- Great story
- Cars are amazing for the era
- City is alive and full of life.
- Graphics are good (I played on Ultra with a GeForce 2060)
- Characters are great , honestly gives me a nice slam down memory lane.

BAD :
- Story is VERY short
Feels like i could have seen more , like Tommy getting married , getting made ect.
- Pauly voice actor is annoying to say the least. (He sounds like Mr.Beefy , the Dog in the movie Little Nicky)
- Money means nothing in a game that portrays a mob life... you can't buy cars , home(s) , clothes.
- No car customizing (You can change colour and choose to put the top down on select vehicles)
- Motorcycle is a pain in the A** to drive. (I play on Simulation)

UGLY :
- Game only crashed on me once
- Frame rate stutter (From time to time)


Closing -
i'll say that the game is fun to play and you'll find that it plays good next to it's 2002 counter part .

Is it worth a buy ??? ---- YES
i would aim at grabbing this during a sale , i don't feel that the game is worth it's asking price due to the short length.

But , but just know what you're getting , you're getting a game that you can Speed run in a day.
Free roam does not really exist unless you select 'free roam' in the main menu.
I personally hate that when a game does that. i want to free roam between missions or jobs.

This game really has potential , but yeah , it's falls short. Really i am only giving this a thumbs up is because of nostalgia of playing a game that i loved so dear.

34,Mafia Definitive Edition,76678292,english,"Very average remake... If you want to play remake of original Mafia you going to be disappointed. It is related to Original Mafia by story yes, but lazy developers rushed game to grab money from loyal fans to the original game. I do not believe that was done for people but for business. What i mean i describe precisely below as I want to give as much honest review not to ruin the reputation of “Hangar 13 “developers as they did that already with Mafia 3 title but to save money to huge fans of the original game done by Illusion Soft works so:

Radio: It is bad, poor music choice variety with only few artist with two stations while the original had no stations at all yet it was loaded depend of your location even if was limited the music was just better but that is the matter of preferences so it up to the Player. 

World interaction: After story ends… Its just dead. Everything is closed around you, game is actually downgraded from original as you can not even use trains and trams... No interaction with anything you like and air all you can do just drive a car nothing else…

World Itself: That I can give it to the developers the attention to details is insane. The world is beautiful and is well made, many things to explore and is just hard to believe that so much work went in to the world and yet is so empty and dead without even having a chance for example to buy a local news paper from the guy who is actually selling them. The details are there but there nothing beside animation.

Voices: Forced Italian accent sometimes just sound wrong, and many times happen I could not distinguish difference between my character talking or someone else, did the developers have not enough voice actors? 

After playing it for few hours I can say this… If developers want to make a remake or remaster and do not wont to add anything to keep as close to original at least do not downgrade the new version you should upgrade if so… Add more content not take away from the original. Mafia is from 2002 You make this one 2020 you should be embarrassed that game from 2002 have more content except graphics that your remake…

My final verdict as I progress towards the end of the game and expect nothing will change for better:

+ graphics
+ upgraded story (more in details)

- bad voice cover
- zero interaction ( cant even go inside trams or trains)
- poor music choice for the era
- glitchy NPCs 

Waiting for remake 20 years we receive slap with turd wrapped in candy package in our face. If you want play remake of the mafia go and mod yourself old mafia the graphics mods. Yes it wont be as near good as the graphics from this version but will be still improved from my experience not everything what is shiny and looks good is actually good. Many remakes was just a flop and this one is on edge of failing, its not all about graphics and many people will agree with me that gameplay is most important, and in this case once you finish main story free roam have no point. There is just car simulator based in 30s an interactive video

I am a huge Mafia fan and i played the original 2002 version countless times.

I just couldn’t win no matter what i did and even if it is possible, i did not want to put so much time into this boring race to master it so i decided to change the difficulty, which now cost me the „made man“ achievement.

A game whose design principles have aged like a fine wine, and whose story is nearly pitch perfect. Mafia 3, this one isn't.

I was skeptical when the same studio behind the disappointing 3rd installment announced they were remaking the original, the OG, from the ground up in their mafia 3 engine which had and admittedly awful showing at first glance with its debut game. But color me surprised.

Mafia: Definitive Edition, despite what one would glean from its title, is absolutely exceptional.

With a story that has a deliberate slow burn to build characters and bond with the player, to some of the best facial animation I've seen in a game in a hot minute, some of the best, most nuanced voice performances I've ever heard in a video game to date, to the best video game rain I've ever seen, Mafia is one I'll be talking about when someone asks me what separates a remake from a remaster. This one is right up there along with Resident Evil 2 in shining examples of how to do it right.

Note: Mafia avoids the trappings and tedium of today's AAA open world titles. The story is almost completely linear like Mafia 2, and there is a completely separate sandbox mode called freeride.

It kind of depends on how strict your definition of ""faithful"" is, however. All the characters are there and all of the missions are there. In each mission, you more or less do the same thing as you did in the original. The reason I say it is not faithful is Tommy's character is completely different and this changes the overall plot of the story. In the original game, I would say Tommy was never comfortable working for the Mafia. In this game, he comes into the family basically wanting to be a gangster. This ends up changing his motivations throughout the story and the reasons for his decline. I feel the new story doesn't hit the same highs as the original and doesn't give me the chills and ""oh crap!"" feeling at the end of the game. 

Generally the changes don't bother me.
Except for the changes to Tommy's character, I actually like most of the changes that were done. Some changes in the story make it more believable. Some missions have parts removed or replaced with a cutscene. While this does remove time you can roam around the city I think it generally removes annoying/ boring/ unnecessary parts to the missions. I prefer it this way. 

Extended story? More of Sarah?
I don't know if I missed something but I don't really thing there was much extended story or more done with Sarah. There are more conversations in the story and you get a little more backstory but it wasn't what I was expecting. Also, with Sarah there were like three or so additional cutscenes with her. In each of them, I never really got the feeling that there was a strong emotional connection between them. It actually almost felt like Sarah didn't like Tommy sometimes. I don't really feel that it expanded on her as a character. I wish they had either gone a different way with her or just not do this. 

The classic difficulty... not what I was expecting
The original game was difficult and with the remaster I was craving an experience that was as close to the original as possible. I played the game on classic difficulty and it is really hard but not in the way I wanted. 

The original game was hard because it was smart with its level design and enemy encounters/ placements. Classic difficulty is hard because they made the game unfair. The way difficulty is achieved here is they make the enemy sponge damage insanely and then they make you extremely weak. Let's say there's an encounter with an enemy with a shotgun. In the original game, they might put the shotgun enemy around a corner or behind cover and make him not move. The reason this is difficult is because you have to be quick to kill the enemy or outsmart him when he's pumping the shotgun. In the remake, they just make the shotgun guy barrel directly at you and the reason this is hard is because your gun can't kill him fast enough before he snipes you with his shotgun. Enemies don't flinch when getting shot in the way they did in the original. This means you can't stall shotgun guy either. This is such an annoying and cheap way to achieve difficulty. The race mission was also 5x harder than it was in the PC version of the original. There were unbelievable moments where right at the very end of the race someone's car decides to just randomly boost itself and magically they zip past you, costing you 1st place. It is impossible to get a significant lead on anyone when you're in first place yet if you don't claw your way into first place by the second lap It's almost impossible to win.

It is hard to control Tommy.
I was hoping for more of a Mafia 2 style cover system. The one that is in this game is really clunky. There's so many times where you either take cover in a place where you didn't want to or exit cover when you didn't want to. I felt like in Mafia 2, the cover system was more... responsive. I also don't like that hitting is not mapped to the same button as firing a weapon, like it was in the original. The new controls can make fist fights hard to do.

Free Ride- Awww yeeeaaahh. 
Freeride was probably my favorite thing in the original game and it was the one thing I was most excited for in the remaster. Freeride is where you do your exploring in the city and much more. There are interesting little sub missions you can do to unlock cars or other special things. It is similar to Freeride Extreme, but nowhere near as annoying. I really prefer the new system. You have to find where the jobs are first- it's really cool.

Since there is less time to explore the city in the story, it is easy to miss out on the Bertone cars. You can get them in Freeride. You no longer have to do jobs to get cars from Lucas. The cars are actually hidden in secret garages in the city and Lucas gives you hints as to where they are. I love this new way of getting cars- It is like Christmas morning when you find a garage. I just wish Lucas had more cars to give you.

The only thing I don't like about freeride is the police are in it and there is no way of controlling the time of day or density of traffic. I have not found a way to control either of these, but I wish there was a way. It isn't as easy to go on shooting sprees or raise hell like you could in the original game.

My final take: This game is REALLY fun and I love it. It is an amazing Mafia game that while different still captures the same level of excitement and exploration with me that the original game had. I am having so much fun with freeride and I cannot believe I have already spent 24 hours on this game. I want DLC and more of this game. I haven't done everything yet in freeride and I really hope there are more surprises in it. I hope the next Mafia game achieves this level of excellence and has a freeride mode that is just as fun. This is an embodiment of how to try new things without soiling what the game was. There were things in this game that really annoyed me, however I want innovation like this going forward with Mafia and I want more Mafia Definitive edition.",1601254562,1601254562,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,3,2,2004,2004,1622,1601738932

I remember to this day few moments of that game. Because of that, purchasing of remake was a must. But unfortunately, those glorious remarkable moments are not back. This game just feels different and it is probably because of the fact that since the time I played the original Mafia, I played more games which set the bar much higher (Witcher 3, GTA 5, Assassins creed and so on). So, if you look after your nostalgic memories, dont expect much :-) from the gaming perspective, this is basically re-skinned Mafia 3, if you are familiar with it, this is gonna be just like it. Graphics and game mechanics are just copy-paste. And even Mafia 3 was brutally repetitive, I was enjoying the RPG mechanics that were included. On the other hand, this game, Mafia 1, is purely story driven, no new mechanics were included (but some were taken on)and if you know the story, or remotely remember it, the old spark is just gone. I play this game and I will finish it, but not as close enthusiasticly than it was couple of decades ago. The atmosphere of the game is just gone and I believe it is more in me than in the game. But I did miss some of the stuff that were part of the original, but now are gone (like the music which I remember to this day). This just felt somehow dull.

A short but sweet game full of fun characters and game play.  I was always into the 30s/40s era Americana.  A slick suit, quick tongue, and a fully loaded Tommy gun is a recipe for great times.

Playing it on Classic difficulty to get the feel of the original that I missed out on.  Ooh boy is it challenging, though if you are not one for enemies that can kill you in 2 seconds then I would put it on normal.  Classic difficulty also makes cops give you tickets for any offence on the road, though I never had issues with the cops so that was a moot point.  Speaking of driving, I had to lower the difficulty because dear god I suck at driving in games.  So I beat the story on Classic but the race and one chase scene was done on Easy.  All-in-all, I would skip Classic to be honest.

There are some issues. A few time an enemy will shoot while in cover as if they are not.  Any sequence where I have to get into a car with cops around I will loose 1/3 or 1/2 my health before I could get onto the road making it more difficult than it needs to be.

84,Mafia Definitive Edition,76686348,english,"After playing 8 hours I rate this as a really competent remake. Stays true to the original, but with gorgeous art, brilliant characterisations and nice quality of life features.

The graphics are beautiful and it runs butter smooth at 60FPS, max settings (sans AA which is on medium) with a GTX 1660S. The only complaint I have is that there's a smearing effect when rotating the camera in bright environments, that sort of looks like artefacts of a sharpening pass. I don't think there is a specific setting for sharpening, only a generic ""post processing"" option, which is a shame. I have not tried to drop the post processing setting however.

The characterisation is excellent. The models are wonderfully detailed and perfectly capture those Italian American mobster genes. Their faces are unique and memorable, without being goofy. The voice acting is pitch perfect most of the time. Paulie and Ralphy are particularly likeable, I wish the latter was in it more. One great thing about this remake is that it takes the already great script of the original and extends it with additional lines here and there to flesh out the personalities and relationships further, and it is all seamless. Just about exactly what you want from a remake in the storytelling department.

The driving feels a bit wonky at first, in that it is very easy to skid wide on corners, however after a few hours you get used to it. I like the driving here because it isn't about speed. Controlling the cars is far easier if you don't constantly pump the accelerator, especially when making turns. You are further prevented from being reckless due to taking character damage from crashes, to the point where you will die faster than your car explodes. I also personally like the speed limiter option, I thought it was an awesome addition in the original and I'm really glad they kept it. There are multiple difficulty options however, to set the police interest in your actions to your liking (just like real life).

The gunplay is also nice, competent third person shooting with cover mechanics. It's simple and works pretty well. The great thing are the animations and blood, which really make you feel like you're in a classic gangster movie. There's a lot of guys ""shaking violently while taking bullets to the chest"", which is :ok_hand: magnifico. Never had an issue getting stuck to cover or nothing like that, and the grenade / molotov throwing works remarkably well. Tommy should be a Rugby / American Football player.

I should note though that this is NOT a simulation game. Anyone expecting GTA will be disappointed. The world here is more of a stage on which the narrative takes place, similar to other classics of the time like Driver and the Getaway. This is a type of game that doesn't really exist anymore, but I'm glad it does here. Not every game can, nor should to be, a hyper detailed simulated universe AND supply a brilliant narrative. For £30 you're getting a great classic brought right up to date.

93,Mafia Definitive Edition,76685662,english,"  *I'm Neutral with this game*
   I'm not great at making reviews but this game is one of my favorites. The remake is neither bad nor great. Coming from the original, unlike most people since it came out in 2002, the remake is a 6-6.5/10. The game stayed true to the story, besides changing some aspects of some of the missions. Like making ""Just For Relaxation"" a stealth/sneak mission and the mention of diamonds. The original was cigars, load crates, and find out there was diamonds. Not a big deal but I guess they need to change it to form to their new ideas about how they would remake this game.
    Performance of this game was... wow. High settings with a i7-8086k @ 5ghz and a 2080ti with a 3440x1440p monitor was getting 80-90fps. take away lighting, shadows, and reflections. You'd get a 10fps increase from what ive seen. The gaming looks amazing don't get me wrong, but why?! Yeah yeah I could turn the settings down for boost in fps but there's games that look better and run better. I didn't run into any major bugs besides Tommy not running on occasion, or getting cover when you tell him to. He'll lock up, twitch out and then proceed to what you told him to do. There were a few micro stutters on rare occasions mostly in the cut scenes.
     The Mechanics/Gunplay. Well the driving on classic difficulty was amazing in terms of the original. Its awful but that's the point and I loved it. The motorcycle is kinda of a let down but still sorta fun to drive regardless. The gunplay is bad to me. Who thought that making a  big ass circle as a reticle for the pistols was a great idea. Then make the Thompson a standard one. I did fine while playing but its really damn stupid to me. Just make the reticle for the shotgun a circle and everything else traditional cross. And throwing a molotov was the worst animation i've seen. Tommy will throw it behind his back like a trick shot as if he was playing basketball. And keybindings wtf. Why can't I leave binds open if I don't use them? Why do I have to fight with Q and not have my hands as a considered weapon and use left mouse as an action. That seems like a normal thing to do for a game nowadays. I put my gun away I have hands free to fight. That's my thoughts tho. Weapon wheel is awful who uses that thing! 
    So look, to me, I felt the original was harder. I beat this on classic difficulty and maybe 2-3 missions were actually hard or challenging. The last mission ""The Death Of Art"" being the hardest one for me. The race took me 4 tries after spinning out on the first two tries and then reloading from start. The Saint and the Sinner mission was my nightmare on the original and I blew through it on the remake. Not saying I'm Pro at the game it just wasn't hard enough.
    For newcomers this should be a 7-8/10 experience for you. The story is amazing and we get to see more of Tommy's life then we did in the original which was a nice thought by the devs. I'd say play it for the story.

10,Mafia Definitive Edition,76684160,english,"This review is based on having never played the original game.

I have read alot of reviews talking about how it isn't like the original, and having looked at some footage after beating this, it is a little different, but not too much.

I thought the story was pretty amazing. It was well told and had great voice acting. Graphics were awesome, sound was awesome, and music was cool as well. Really liked how it all played out and how emotionally attached you could become. I really got into this game and couldn't stop playing it. Took me a little over 14 hours to beat.

Not all is prefect though. I couldn't get the game to load, but after searching the discussions boards, that was easily taken care of. Game was also choppy, but again, thanks to the discussion boards, that was easily taken care of as well. So thank you to those who help the rest of us. Much appreciated. There was alot of chase levels in this game, and the driving controls suck ass. I mean really suck ass.  Also, if you have remapped your controls, there is a fight scene where you will need to reset your controls to the original settings or you will never beat the large hoodlum. 

Other than that, I really liked this game alot. Just such a great adventure and amazing story telling (though maybe too much as I would have liked a little more shoot em up in this. Can't wait to start the next chapter and see all the story, action, and surprises that are awaiting.

If you have played the originals, you may be a little disappointed. If you haven't, you will be a fan, especially if you have played LA Noir (which this feels alot like).

I couldn't put it down this whole weekend, I just HAD to see what happened next! I was a big fan of Mafia 2 for years but never went back to play 2002's Mafia. This was PERFECT for a guy like me.

If you were a fan of Mafia 2 and it's style, I think you'll enjoy this as much as I did. It trims down all the open-world elements in return for getting visually stunning cutscenes complemented by absolutely phenomenal voice acting. Each of the action elements and stealth scenes enhance the experience and keep you on the edge of your seat. Surprisingly, I enjoyed the driving a lot and it's actually more-scarce than in Mafia 2. If that still isn't your fancy, you can turn it off before starting the game. OG Mafia fans know there is a driving scene in here that steals the show, and to set your mind at ease, they NAIL it.

I guess I just have one thing left to say:

20,Mafia Definitive Edition,76683615,english,"Now before I get into the review, I just want to say that I've not played the original and recently finished Mafia 3 DE. So I'm came into Mafia 1 DE completely fresh and didn't know what to expect.

Let's get the obvious part of out the review: Graphics. The game's visuals is stunning to say the least and It left me wanting more. Everything from character models, buildings, etc is to be expected for a 2020 game. I'm going to try something new for my reviews and I'm going to give each part of the game to give a conclusion and verdict for each and every parts mentioned in this review. 10/10

Weapons and attrition. I was a bit disappointed on the weapons the game had to offer. I'll list out the weapons the game has for you: 1 automatic: Tommy gun, 1 primary shotgun: Trench shotgun, one bolt-action and I can't remember its name, M1911, about 4 revolvers, and a sawed off DB shotgun; now tell me if you're not disappointed with the weapons they give you. Next up, attrition. I'm extremely sad because my entire time 15 hours playing the game, I've only got to about 20 med kits, so that means that I find myself almost dead in just about any gunfights (also note that one bullet will deal a lot of damage and you barely heal any hp). One last thing, ammo is so scarce that I have to start punching enemies to death because the game gave me little to no ammo for missions (I played on classic so when I reload a non-empty clip/mag, I loose whatever ammo left in the clip/mag). Poor choice of weapons, 7/10. Absolutely terrible supplies to start with and no money to collect or spend: 5/10 (I was going to give it a 6 but I had to take my rage into account because the little amount of hp given gets me killed about 80% of my fights).

Story and character development. I liked the story of Mafia 1, a cab driver who found himself at the doorstep of a big mafia family and joins in hopes of making money, this game's got a unique and good story and I was able to continue playing it because it was just that good. The main characters were cool, I liked their journey together. Some of Paulie's lines got me cracking and the main trios were pretty good characters. I got pretty emotionally invested when everything went downhill (trying to keep this a spoiler free review). Story gets a 9/10 because there were parts that just bores me and not that interesting. Characters gets a 10/10.

All in all, Mafia 1 DE is a great game and I'd recommend you buy the game; I'd also like to say that the game is only $40 and not a full price of $60, showed me that the people at Hangar 13 and 2k aren't greedy. Oh yeah, for the best experience, play the game on Classic difficulty and enable manual transmission then you'll have the hardest and fun gameplay experience. Despite the poor weapon of choice, I know most of us will only be using the Tommy since it's one of the most iconic SMG in and out of the world of criminals; and the attrition maybe be annoying, but I hope it's not detrimental to the game play because with all that aside, Mafia 1 DE is overall a great and a somewhat underrated game overshadowed by the other failures known as Mafia 2 and 3 DE (Mafia 2 isn't a bad game but Hangar 13 screwed up the remaster, Mafia 3 is another story). I'd to give this game is 7.5/10, thanks for making it to the end and I hope mine and the other reviews help you make up your mind on buying the game; or just you reading this because you're interested in what other people think.

Final verdict: 7.5/10

Pros
--------

+ Fun, cinematic gameplay
+ Graphics - Gorgeous visuals (really incredible lighting and materials - game deserves a photo mode)
+ World feels authentic with era appropriate props
+ Story
+ Soundtrack
+ Performance (Stable 60+ fps throughout on GTX 1080 at 1440p)
+ Solid sound design (guns feel punchy)
+ Price (less than $60 for a full remake)

Cons
--------

- THAT RACING MISSION (seriously, I had to lower the difficulty for that level)
- Janky animation (running around and fist fights could be much better, cover system needs to be smoother)
- The city seems a little empty at times (this is more of a nitpick TBH)

Overall - 8/10",1601245434,1601246001,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,1364,49,985,985,301,1601481760
23,Mafia Definitive Edition,76683340,english,"Mafia 1 was the game of my heart. I spent my childhood in that game and I loved every second, even if it was rather too intense seconds sometimes. I loved the game way more, than any GTA, or other games from the genre. When I heard about the remake, I wasnt exactly hyped, but I hoped for a good game. I hoped for a remake that brings in all the memories and let me to dive in to the state-of-the-art game. Now, when I finished the story, together with the extreme ride, I can say, that the developer did a great job.

Pluses (+)
+ The city was polished, with some new areas and streets, but it keeps its soul and style
+ The missions list is same, but each of them is changed in a positive way
+ Player know the missions and the city, but it feels, like if its played for the first time
+ The graphic is stunning, its something between M2 and M3, but its really beautiful
+ The game is well optimized, I had to turn shadows low, but I barely can see the difference and I got 120 FPS
+ The city is living, its breathing, with its own soul and with many things to see
+ The return of free roam. Story is great, but wandering around the town in car of your pick is heart warming.
+ New cinematics are great
+ Not a single bug encountered

Minuses (-) (Maybe those things will be patched in further patches, who knows. But for now:)
- Public transport is not enterable (In original it was, like trams and trains)
- No taxi missions in free roam (In original it was a thing)
- Some cars are missing, some could be added (Like from M2)
- There are options for weather and day, but there is missing rainy day option
- Drawbridges are not working outside of missions

All in all, the game is great, its great fun to play it and its deserved remake of the original. There are minuses of course. Some people are reporting also bugs, but I was lucky enough to avoid them and even if there is missing stuff, which was part of the original, I still hope that it will get patched in to the game later. In curent condition of the game I would say 9,5/10. But if the things get added, with some extra stuff, like accessible interiors and some more cars, at least few, then it will be a solid 10/10.

This game is amazing. I just can't explain how amazing this is. It stays true to the original, but expands upon it, as well as making big improvements in many aspects. Combat was really good, as well as driving.
Only issues with the game are just a small few bugs here and there, but No where near as bad as Mafia 3. 
And since the game mainly focuses on the story, there's not too much to do in the world except explore. But with how good the story is, it's all you'll focus on.

35,Mafia Definitive Edition,76561480,english,"TL; DR: This game is remake of original Mafia with new features and vibe of new open world game. They respected original story and game itself is great, but if you expect remaster of original game, that will be same, but with better graphics, you will probably be disappointed (but I still recommend you to change your expectation and play this game anyway, because it is worth it)

This is not a remaster. This game is complete remake of original Mafia: The City of Lost Heaven and I personally think that 2K aced it. Yes, there may be some unwanted ""new"" features, which weren't present, in original game - like obnoxious HUD helping you a bit too much. I really don't want to put this as thing that would break the original experience, because that's just how games are nowadays (this is a problem, and we should not be okay with this, but since it is not relevant to this game only I won't include it as relevant to this review so keep this in mind).

This game won't fill ya with old school feelings, but it will give you flashbacks to the original game. They respected the original game as much they could and made it from ground up again. Classic difficulty respects difficulty of old school games and is challenging and race can not be skipped just like in the original game.

Overall game is great and has its place in Mafia series and even tho it is not same as the Mafia, I think this perfectly fits next to it and if you haven't played original mafia play it first anyway. These two games are not the same, they just have a same story, and both are exceptionally great.",1601071893,1601244060,TRUE,2,0,0.540636063,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,250,4,752,752,752,1601206979

And the story is much more clearer now. Ubishit should learn from this and make PoP good. This game deserves every penny. If you played it before it does not matter you can play it again in full enjoyment. If you never played the classic then your in for a Excellent story and gameplay.

The story while being really good is also very very short (about 15 assignments give or take). the graphics are very well done for a remake and the game runs smoothly. however it is unable to have frame cap removed so its only 60fps max. at this point i have beaten the game o maximum difficulty and there is almost no replaying potential (there are collectables but meh...). if your looking to purchase this game i would wait until its on sale about $15 or $20 as this is for sure a game you play through once and never again once you beat it. i would give it a 6.5 out of 10 for the actual game its enjoyable but not something that can be played over and over again.  for comedy value i give it a 8 out of 10 lots of penis jokes always fun!,1601243726,1601243726,TRUE,1,0,0.523809552,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,64,5,679,679,679,1601243154
38,Mafia Definitive Edition,76682010,english,"Pretty good game. 
I haven't played the original so can't really compare it to it but thus far I'm really enjoying it. 

The game is beautiful, the story even better.
The driving is hit or miss I think. when you're driving like a maniac the cars feel nice and weighty and you can powerslide like a pimp, but when you driving normally the steering feels weird, maybe it's because I'm on a keyboard(?)

The game is very well optimized. I've been able to mantain 60fps no problem on my RTX 2070. Also played it on my GTX 1650 for giggles and it ran at a decent 35-ish fps on the medium preset, if you're willing to put everything to low I'm sure you can hit those buttery smooth 60 frames.

21:9 support is alright, on launch the game prompts you to adjust the game's hud to your screens aspect ratio. The cutscenes will have black bars, unfortunately, 

I've ran into a few bugs, nothing game breaking but can get in the way of immersion. 
-Sometimes enime NPC's get stuck in time when they see you and it takes them 2 or 3 seconds to react to your presence. 
-I've been detected when stealthily killing a guard. 
-From time to time you may get an artifact here or there. At first I thought it was my 2070 so I got my 1650 and it got artifacts as well so I don't know what's up with that. 
-The animations can me a bit robotic. especially the vault and climbing animations, Hanger 13, please fix.
-Also you can sometimes see traffic spawn, Hangar 13, please fix.
 
Other than that I'm loving the game. The story is great, the game is beautiful, the shooting and driving could use some work but you can get used to it pretty fast.

Most scenes, missions and dialogue is completly reworked  and the fantastic story is still intact. The graphical overhaul is also very well done. All the characters are very well done, the shooting and sound is very solid as well.

I do wish there were overhauls in more areas, for instance i wish music of that period played more of a role in scenes and in the game, kind of like they did in Mafia III. It felt a little thematically dry in that sense. The controls are also a bit of an issue, i beileve they carried over a bit of the poor control scheme from the original Mafia... things like using ""Q"" for melee and ""alt Left"" to cover sort of feel out of place in today's standard control mapping. There also was a glitch or two, but nothing game breaking really. They also changed the ending quote sadly, but the ending regardless still packs a punch.

Another small grip for some, especially in the modern era of gaming...is that you are unable to do much, if anything around the city of Lost Heaven. The replayability lacks...but honestly, the core of Mafia isn't in it's open world element. The world simply acts as a thematic shell for the experience, they want you to play for the unfolding events and trageities not go to strip clubs and carnivals. That's what Grand Theft Auto is for.

[b]CONS:[/b]
- No steering wheel support whatsoever. The original, 18 years ago, supported steering wheels. Given that half the game is about driving (you start off as a taxi driver after all, and there is a dedicated Free Ride mode), this is unbelievable in 2020.
- Melee is extremely watered down as well. You always get a ""Press Alt to dodge"" prompt and you never lose any health this way, no matter who your opponent is or how many there are.
- Missions are watered down. Everything is fed in your mouth: where to go exactly, and how to solve any part of any mission. No exploration or thinking needed. Story twists are taken out from 1 and explained by the characters in the cutscene videos instead. So needless.
- Tommy's relationship with Sarah was advertised to be more explored. Yet there is literally a cutscene with ""Marry me"" - ""Ok."" Someone didn't feel like developing her character much.
- Sam is almost completely absent in the storyline. In the original, Paulie, Sam and Tom were all equal in their endeavours. The final mission, therefore, becomes meaningless, or not as grand as it was originally.
- When wanted by police, in the original police could no longer identify you if you got out of your vehicle when out of their sight (as they only had the description of the car, not you), or in reverse, if you committed a crime on foot but entered a car when not seen. This was unique back then but fully removed (rather, not implemented) in this version.
- You cannot do taxi missions in Free Ride (wow...). Free Ride is lifeless and pointless: you can only explore the city and collect collectables, and some FR Extreme elements implemented.
- The story and missions are over-dramatic. The original was praised to have an almost movie-like, realistic plot. This DE version is like a modern action-packed action movie in comparison with lots of explosions, bangs, drama everywhere.

[b]PROS:[/b]
- Beautiful graphics, detailed car models
- Lots of work put into motion capture and mimicking Chicago accent
- City was slightly reworked, which turned out very pleasant (though, I can no longer get from A to B as streets, buildings, layouts are completely different - despite knowing the original map like the back of my hand)
- Playthrough is overall longer, which is nice. Still only 7-8 hours, though. Most missions were reworked so that you can't finish certain missions too quickly (e.g. a very quick escape in the original birthday mission where you could shoot the politician and run downstairs to the getaway boat instantly - 1 bullet mission. Here you are forced to go around floors through enemies to escape).

[b]VERDICT:[/b]
For those who loved the original, it will be likely partially a disappointment. Still, as a fan, you obviously won't want to miss out on this. It's enjoyable overall.

I like that you actually can take Pauli to Blue Tropics instead of his home after the race.

I don't like current characters temper. They all are cocky and dirty. For example Tom is supa-dupa cool guy like he was really born with a gun. He is not that shy (in some way) guy anymore.

1. Intro movie.
2. Graphics (not the best, but still acceptable to me)

4. Well optimized performance.

Cons: 
1. Short story mode, instead of gameplay we got cutscenes.
2. No Lucas Bertone missions. Nuff said.
3. No Free Ride Extreme.
4. Dead world with NO activity. 
5. No variability. For example, OG players will understand: no shoot-the-wheels-before-rescue-Sam trick in a ""Regular Routine""; no quiet exit option in a ""Visiting rich people"", no option to quietly leave the prison in ""Reelection""; no use for Ralphie at all, just universal lockpicks.

The gameplay is quite smooth, aiming and shooting is great, fistfights, on the other hand, aren't that good. Driving is nice, although maybe a bit too easy, as driving in Mafia II was a bit more challenging and more varied between cars.

Took me 15 hours to finish story mode, most of it on ""Classic"" difficulty - I really got stuck at some places, but overall there's more shooting and less driving, compared to the original 2002 game.

Did not play the original Mafia, so have no nostalgic feelings towards it. This is completely objective.

Mafia: Definite Edition, while not being a bad game pr se, just felt boring and lackluster to me. This is a little odd, because I usually love GTA style games (i even liked Mafia II and III). I feel the missions are, while probably trying to stay true to the original game, repetitive and non-creative. The characters are ultra stereotypical and predictable, including the main protagonist. Same goes for the story, which reads like a bad, below budget Netflix drama.

31,Mafia Definitive Edition,76577703,english,"Ok I'm an old fan of the first Mafia and finished the original game like 5 times. I declare most of the downvotes to be bs. Ignore them and try it out. This is 2020, and 2002 way of making games is long gone. Sorry if that's major news to you and you expected to see a game from that era with graphics being the only difference.

Very brief: all the bells and whistles in the original game that the die-hard fans are so furious are missing in the remake served no real purpose in the gameplay. The first game was about story, and lots of mindless driving, because driving in a 3D city of 1930 was a very novel thing for 2002. What made sense then doesn't make sense now. Stop whining. And even more, that city from 2002 game was an empty boring ghost town, and everybody who tried the free ride mode can attest. Being able to turn headlights and engine on and off and ride the local tram didn't really help with that too much.

So what made the first game iconic? The story. And the remake nailed it. That's what matters. It's more fleshed out, with longer cut-scenes, less voice-over narration cutting corners, with decent dialogues and facial animations and distinct personalities. Even though I know how it ends, I'm still hooked and can't stop playing to see the next piece of it. Attention to details is remarkable and in-game locations are a joy to explore.

Things that I first thought were questionable is indeed some personality changes, especially Tommy and Paulie, but after playing a bit I don't think it detracts from the game. They are different yes, but still consistent and likeable and present a different spin on the old story making it even more fun to experience again. Also - and that is no small thing - keep in mind your childhood memories can significantly distort reality. If you're not happy with a cut scene or voice acting in the new game, just go ahead and watch the walkthrough of the original. You may be surprised how dumb certain scenes actually look. Like Sarah's line for example, in the original game Tommy and Sarah had sex literally 20 minutes after meeting each other, while in the remake their relationship is much more believable and feels more real.

Anyway, the game is great and deserves to be experienced. Give it a try.

The story, which was and is the strongest factor of this game, was carried out really well. I found it fun to pick out the slight changes that were made to it. Nonetheless, although some of them may seem a little risky, it is to be observed that they were all planned out and executed very carefully. The relations between characters were highlighted, which, compared to the original, makes them more mature and deep. Now we have an insight to the emotions and feelings that made, Tommy and his friends. do certain things.
Gameplay was balanced out. In the original Mafia game, after playing it through a few times, some parts of the game were getting a bit dull and repetitive. The people who stand behind the remake identified those problems, and turned them into something engaging and interesting. 
Another factor is the vibe. Radio, cars, city, cinematic scenes and all the small details - everything fits gracefully and now it feels more like we're in the 30s. I love the cutscenes by the way.
As someone who played the original game a few times, It is a truly interesting feeling to play this remake. You know what's going to happen in the game, but after it happens, you are surprised in a good way. 
Of course there are some minor bugs, but they are nothing compared to how actually good this game is.
To all those who complain, I think they are overly focused on the trivial details and ignorant about the way greater aspects.

Now there is some collectibles you may try to find and collect in the freeride mode, but that's it. Who the hell wants to drive around in circles all across Lost Heaven with nothing else to do? No racing at the race track? No bank robberies? No wars between the familes? No vehicle customization at Lucas Bertones shop? No vehicle theft requests from Ralphie? No gunrunning from Vincenzo? These are just some kind of missions I could think of that you could have been able to do in the freeride mode after you have completed the storyline to expand on the game and it's 1930's setting and environment.

Don't know if the devs are planning on selling some overpriced DLC's in the future, but this game feels like a rushed, unpolished, unfinished and shallow DLC for Mafia 3 (the gameplay is more or less like it was in Mafia 3 but much, much more buggy and glitchy) and in my opinion it doesn't cherish the memory of the original Mafia 1, at all.

While I may have minor gripes with the gameplay (most of it being problems I already had with Mafia 3's gameplay), the rest is incredibly solid.

The gameplay is mostly good don't get me wrong, shooting is pretty good, driving did take a little of getting used to but once you get the hang of it, it's not too bad either.
My problems stems more from the combat and the weird animations, which again are all issues I had with Mafia 3's gameplay, which were just copy/pasted into this game, but it's not enough to ruin the gameplay completely, just things that can be a little annoying from time to time.
But the main crux of this game is the story, and it's a damn good one at that.

From beginning to end, I was hooked and invested in the story, the missions were all great.
There can be some tough ones, like the stealth missions and a particular race, but there are also some incredibly fun missions too, I won't get into much detail because I wouldn't want to spoil it, but I can say for sure, that you will be having a lot of fun with the grand majority of the missions in this game.

The acting is also great, characters are realistic and interesting, Thomas Angelo is a great protagonist and supporting ones like Salieri and Sam have great depth behind them.

The music is fantastic too, by the time I finished the game, I would get chills every time I heard the music in the menu, has such a great noir sound to it.
The radio is the game is pretty good too, it really helped in sucking me into the world of the game.

Speaking of investing players into this game, the open world does a great job at that and just the atmosphere in general, there is one mission which takes place during a particularly rainy night, and it looked absolutely stunning.

So overall, it's fair to say that I would highly recommend this game, especially if you are someone who loves and prefers great single player story games like myself.

If you're the kind of person who leaves the main story aside and does all available side quests first, this game is probably not for you. This is, I believe, the most important thing about this game that needs to be said and got out of the way first.

With that out of the way, here goes. I played the original Mafia back when I was 13 and was completely floored by its graphics, atmosphere, story, and characters. But over 16 years later, I remember very little of its gameplay, and even some specifics of the story have left my memory. So I return to Lost Heaven with this remake, with a decent idea of the plot and characters, but not much more than that.

The story largely remains the way I remember. Largely the same set of ""chapters"", in what I believe to be the same order. Only, with two merged into one, which I suspect is solely because they wanted to rename one of the two chapters for 2020's sensibilities. But this doesn't have a bearing on the content, which remains intact. 

You control Tommy Angelo, taxi driver who becomes a mobster in the family of Ennio Salieri largely out of desperation, and then climbs the ranks. His story is a carefully crafted, gripping affair. While I have no clue what a real crime syndicate would function like, the story is very believable, and the characters feel human. I did not fully understand it when I was 13, this time it's very clear to me how this story weaves its narrative into the matter of prohibition which is running through the first half of the game, and how those laws led to gang activity. It is perhaps ironic that the story is what I think is the strong point of this game, while being unable to say much about it to avoid spoiling. I think people coming into this game completely blind are going to be in for a wild ride, if they have some patience. The story, and the game as a whole, starts off a bit slow.

While I cannot be entirely sure, I think this version of the game improves on the story aspect. The new graphics, new voice work, even the new character models, all add up to that. The characters feel real, with extra depth added to certain characters who had very little in the original. But note that some players of the original might be put off by the changes in how some characters look and sound. 

The gameplay on the other hand is an average driving and shooting affair. You drive to a set location, and shoot some people, do other things sometimes, and drive some more. Decent enough, but nothing really special. The devs have taken great care designing the city of Lost Heaven, however, and I found driving around the world to be entertaining in itself. If you don't want to just drive around, though, the devs have provided an option for you to skip non-essential drives. (I did not use this, so I don't know for sure how it works)

Some things that I do remember from the old game have been lost or changed. The cars drive faster. In the original game, the cars drove slow, which I assume would've been accurate to the 1930s that this story is set in. But in this game, they drive more like cars from much later. Cars do not appear to run out of fuel like they did in the original game. And unless you set the game to ""classic"" difficulty (I did not; Mafia is not a game I remember for its gameplay), you will not need to follow the speed limit or obey road rules for the most part. Just don't shoot people or knock into cop cars, and you're good for the most part. All this makes the game feel somewhat like a more modern affair, and honestly, I like it. But I can see why these can be off putting changes to some.

The shooting is, let's say, adequate. When using the Tommy gun, perhaps more than adequate. But in general, it's your average decent cover shooter. Melee combat on the other hand, is at best awkward, and at worst plain bad. There's no other way for me to put it. The driving is actually fun, even though the cars clearly drive much faster than they should have been able to in that era. (Perhaps the simulation setting changes this? I don't know. I was fine with it and did not try) The cars handle well enough, and the world looks incredible as you drive through it.

But despite often feeling like a game of the current era with all its options to make life easier for the player, it's very clear that this is still an old school game. That is to say, the game is a heavily story driven affair, and despite the game being set in a gorgeous world where you can drive anywhere you want in, it is NOT an open world game. You go through the story, from one chapter to another, and there's no free roaming downtime between chapters. While the original game had several ""return to Salieri's Bar"" sections where you could go do a few side missions but these are largely gone from the remake, making it even more streamlined than the original. (It is said that some of these missions are now in Free Ride mode, but I have yet to check that side of things out) The game wants you to play through the story, and that makes perfect sense, as that is what this game is about. But for those who REALLY want to tick those checkboxes off, the game offers you collectibles, such as comics and cigarette cards strewn across its large map that you can collect. Some of these are in chapter exclusive locations, so you may have to replay some of the game's 20 chapters if you miss them and still want to collect them all.

Okay, so perhaps I have rambled enough now.

So, TL;DR: If you want to enjoy a gripping story of the Italian American Mafia in 1930s America, and you don't care that it's linear or that it's not an open world or a gameplay-driven game, buy this.

- Pretty decent graphics
- Greatly expanded plot/scenario in most of the missions with cut scenes and dialogs
- Classic mode idealy replicates the pain and sweat I experianced in very first versions of unpatched mafia 1

- Pretty poor car driving physics. Even worse than in the original game
- Afwul shooting/aiming mechanics. 
- Unrememberable soundtrack
- Extremly poor facial animations
- Few ingame narratives replaced with just cutscenes (ie: bringing Sam to doc in countryside mission, final mission preperation, bank robbery briefing)
- Lack of city exploration via main quest walkthrough
- Removed nonlinear mission elements that were in original game (after prison cops chase, 3 different Morello endings, silent mansion robbery)

Pros:
 - Graphics are fantastic and some of the best out there right now. Definitely holds the quality 
   I've come to expect from the Mafia games.
 - Sound design is good, including guns, cars, and voice acting (excluding some older audio files that are used).
 - Weighty vehicles are still here with a de-emphasis on reckless driving.
 - Mission design so far is good. Nice pacing and solid build up to each chapter's climax.
 - Writing is hella good, I'd not played the original Mafia before this and I was hooked faster 
   than Mafia II.

Cons:
 - Animations are hit or miss. Stuff like walking and cover are alright. Others like climbing and 
   getting into cars feel stiff and too fast.
 - Weird fullscreen and borderless modes. Had issues with taskbar showing in borderless and getting low menu FPS in fullscreen (Vsync was off).
 - Key bindings are awful. Preset controls feel awkward and you can't map to basic keys like scroll wheel or thumb mouse buttons. This makes playing with a controller a necessity.
 - Graphics settings feel so basic. There's little description for what these LOW/MED/HIGH 
    settings do and how much that will impact the GPU. Just look at any Rockstar or Ubisoft 
    title on PC for how to do a graphics menu.

3,Mafia Definitive Edition,76666649,english,"Amazing remake of Mafia.

Gameplay feels very firm, driving physics are heavy but control extremely well, gunplay is as good as it can get and animations are smooth.

It's pretty much how i remember the original Mafia to be, characters are depicted well, but my only concern is that Paulie looks exactly like Jimmy Fallon.

They've added some new stuff to the story and to the world, but they have also cut corners, free play is pretty much pointless except for getting collectibles, which is sad. I know Mafia is not known for it's free roaming gameplay outside the storyline, but they could of added at least more locations to enter, clothing stores, restaurants, bars, minigames and such, but nope. Just collectibles.

Still, Mafia is my favorite kinda game, 3rd person action game with a gripping cinematic story.

Man that screwed me. I was constantly playing on Hard and honestly, the best I could do in that mission was like placing 7th. i'd get to 3rd or 4th, screw up a turn and want to cry as I restart all over again.

The original, after almost 20 years, is definitely showing it’s age - especially in combat mechanics, voice acting, and graphics. Yet the new Definitive Edition’s gameplay is inferior. Learning how to steal cars from Ralph? Gone. Lucas Bertone’s side missions? Gone. Riding the tram and trains? Gone. Money system? Gone. Even the little details like the turn signals when driving are missing. Some features from the newer Mafia 2 like the car customization (changing license plates to escape the cops), consumable food and drink (like buying burgers from the diner or beer from the bar), or even interacting with the environment (turning the water on in the bathroom sink) are missing from the game. I hope Hanger 13 adds at least some of these features back in a future update.

But, and this is a big but, when looking at Mafia Definitive Edition as a stand alone game and not comparing it to others, it’s actually really good! The story is captivating even if not entirely faithful to the original, I absolutely love the voice acting and character depth, the game looks gorgeous, physics and driving is excellent, there is a lot to explore, combat is quite good, and the game is really fun!

Downside? Well, if you've played it before, you get absolutely no surprises, but it's fine. Oh and including Mafia III's car is absolutely lore-breaking. It would be like bringing the Delorean in... I get it why they did it but it's a big No-no for me.

It's not a real open world game as GTA or RDR2 it's like the first Mafia and LA Noire, you play it for the story...and it's great! They improved a lot the original plot with more insight and emotions of the characters. 
If you want to explore Lost Heaven they give us this possibility with Free Ride mode (open world), it's a bit empty but enjoyable. 

So what are you waiting for? Put your fedora, suit and coat and return in Lost Heaven!

Gameplay wise, it's a major improvement from the predecessor, Mafia 3. Cops will now cite tickets, arrest and so on, they expanded them. Of course, if you don't want them to harass you (speeding, running red lights, etc), you can tone down the cop difficulty which is a simply brilliant idea.

Of course there are flaws, mainly AI ones. Cops still ignore other NPCs, some AI are pretty dumb (shooting at walls when you stand next to them) and so on. This doesn't happen for the most part but it's there.
Bugs exist but very few and rarely game-breaking ones.

- Don't even think about going for any other difficulty level than the 'classic (klasická)'. This is how you get the closest to the original Mafia. I started on 'middle' and you cut thought the game as knife through butter. Police doesn't care that you are speeding and so on. A little challenge is necessary part of the game.

- You can feel the console influence. It's a bit more linear than I remember. You are always on a mission, there is no ""free time"", when you can just go see Lucas for example. The UI helpers makes it the usual console game ... go to point A and push button B.

- The whole ""mini game"" of getting better cars, learning how to get into them has been removed from the game. You just get the best car as you progress though the story. There is no Lucas side missions. I tried to go to him once at the beginning of a mission.

Great job Hangar 13 and 2k.

Was kind of not expecting it to be this good, sorry about that, eh? The reason for that... Well... Mafia 3...

This was truly a masterpiece. Gotta say it's about as good as Mafia 2. Maybe even slightly better. Mafia 2 is by far the best game on my Steam. It's such a beautiful masterpiece. This was nicely telling the story of Tommy Angelo. A taxi driver who joined the Salieri gang.

The graphics are truly beautiful, reflections, water and light effects are outstanding! Gotta say the game runs really good as well. About 100FPS on i9 9900k, Asus Geforce RTX 2070 and 32GBs of RAM.

The story line is told very nicely and you really get to know the different characters. It also intertwines the story from Mafia 2 a little bit. **SPOILER**: [spoiler]When for example Vito Scaletta kills Tommy in regards of Don Salieri. You will see this in Mafia 2 as well.[/spoiler] I also want to say that I have completed Mafia 2 nine times. On all various difficult settings.
Simply amazing.

I still though, have to say, that Mafia 2 is still the game I consider the best story on. [spoiler]I have to say I shed a tear or two at the end when Joe Barbaro was taken away, and the line: ""Sorry kid, Joe wasn't part of our deal"" was said.[/spoiler]

The driving physics are great in simulation, you can do amazing drift, especially with Lincoln Clay's car. The driving is really good. However, you'll really damage your car if there's a bump in the road and it feels like the car ""catches"" to the ground. Really feels like a bug, but it only happens in really fast speeds.

Sounds are great, however, I have a couple of sound glitches where the sound disappears or music stops and starts randomly. Not really an issue though, although annoying.

A really cool details i noticed was the radio in tunnels, the reception goes bad and you almost don't hear it. Cool feature.


Some things that could be better:
* Render distance is really low, you can only see cars render in a 100m or under in front of you.
* Alt+tabbing can cause video to hang or the game to crash.
* Crash physics are terrible. Not like in Mafia 1 where there actually were crash physics or you could really damage your car.
* Ragdolls when dead are placed awkwardly, for example standing or doing weird stuff. Not an issue, although a little annoying

-the cutscenes. I mean, why? I want to play the game, not watch a movie. When I want to jump the marshall bridge to escape the cops, I want to jump it, not get to it and watch a sequence? Its especially worse that they probably spent a lot of time doing those cutscenes than working on the game itself.

The game, story and characters have all been expanded with more content and the whole story is being explained in a much more cinematic and aesthetically pleasing way. The gameplay is great and a lot of fun, Classic difficulty offers a little bit of a challenge, but unfortunately melee got the short end of the stick, turning it into just a one button mashing spam until the enemy is down.
Small gameplay and quality of life changes, like Ralph not being required to visit anymore thanks to your personal garage, but still being an option for those who want to and small ""skips"" around the map to help you escape from the cops.

24,Mafia Definitive Edition,76651063,english,"I wish Steam still had the ability to do neutral reviews, because this game fits perfectly in that. It's neither good, nor completely bad. A remake on Mafia 1 is a godsend, but it didn't exactly hit the spot like it should have. It added some good things to Mafia but also took away some of the good original content.

[h1] Pro's: [/h1]

[b] Graphics: [/b] Obviously, the graphics have improved greatly when compared to the original. It's honestly quite beautiful; I only noticed a few graphical hiccups every now and then, but nothing immersion or game breaking. The game feels a bit too bright out of the shadows, blood/vehicle headlights can be low quality, and puddles are bland; though it's very nice overall. Optimization was fine.
[b] Customization: [/b] When in Free Ride, you can choose from around maybe 20 outfits to use; which is a pretty nice addition to the game. Also, you have a garage similar to Mafia 2 where you can pull out every vehicle you have discovered and paint the exterior/interior of each vehicle respectively.
[b] Driving: [/b] On simulation, the driving feels pretty heavy and nice. It has a very borderline boat feeling to it, but leaves you satisfied when you pull off a slick drift. The vehicle camera can be a bit annoying when trying to make tight turns though.
[b] Police: [/b] Getting chased by the police can feel pretty intense most of the time; the idea of police radio chatter is also a nice addition. Though it is pretty informal and could have been done a bit better in my opinion.
[b] Story: [/b] The expanded/changed story is mostly pretty good. A few things shouldn't have been touched; but I welcomed most of the changes and even liked them more than the original. The voice acting can be a little underwhelming, but does the job.
[b] Cover system: [/b] I actually enjoy the new cover system being implemented. It makes gunfights a lot more fluid than the original.
[b] The dreaded racing mission: [/b] It very much haunted me on Classic difficulty. Took me about 8 or more tries to get it right. It was more or less just finding the exploit on how to win; which I won't say here; but it was faithful to the original, so I can appreciate that.

[h1] Neutral: [/h1]

[b] Audio: [/b] The audio has both taken steps forward and backwards. Starting off with the remastered soundtrack, the main theme doesn't feel as intense as the original did. The new music is okay, though when I visited the old soundtrack from the original, it left me feeling disappointed for the remake. Gun sounds are rather lacking, the Tommy Gun and the 1911 sound more like pop guns than actually .45 caliber weapons. They took out some of the best original radio songs from Django Reinhardt and replaced them with rather lacking filler songs. The news radio commentary is an OK touch though.
[b] Gunplay: [/b] Gunplay is just average; weapon sounds are pretty lacking as described above. The weapons feel very under-powered and weightless when compared to the original. You're not allowed to carry more than one pistol, one long gun, 2 grenades/molotovs, and one melee weapon. In the original, you could carry up to 6 weapons or so and were more attached to your weapon loadout. The same weapons from the original are in the remake though; save for the snub-nose revolver. Crouching/combat rolling was also removed. Ammo was a huge problem on Classic difficulty for me. Ammo was pretty scarce. The weapons feeling and acting very weak didn't help that problem. All you had to do to replenish ammo was sprint over an enemies dead body and get a random; usually small; amount of ammo to get you along another minute.
[b] Melee: [/b] The remake adds a sort of quick time event style melee system which is okay, but feels more like button mashing than anything else. Not to say that the original wasn't button mashing either; but I feel it could have been pulled off like Mafia 2 did.

[h1] Negative: [/h1]

[b] Free Ride: [/b] They did the sacred Free Ride mode dirty in the remake. It's actually rather boring. No money, no patrolling gangsters, no Yellow Pete's Gun Shop, etc. It's pretty much just finding collectibles which is disappointing. Free Ride Extreme is included; and is okay.
[b] Environment/Misc: [/b] They stayed mostly true to the original map which is good; though they completely took out public transportation such as Trolleys and Trams. The entire Tram track is blocked off. They roam around the city but you can't step in them at all like in the original. Pedestrians/enemies can not be run over by vehicles, they just side step out of the way like sonic and get clipped. There was a quite annoying rag doll bug where when enemies were killed; their bodies would freeze mid-air and look like they were still standing.
Gas stations also got their cut scene removed where an attendant would come out and refuel your vehicle; instead it just switches the camera for a second and bang; you're vehicle is good to go.
[b] Missions: [/b] The missions are very scripted and even more linear than the original. Some of this resulted in bad level design during some shootouts. It takes away the players freedom of how they want to approach the level.

This is all I can think of at the moment, there might be even more to add. I was greatly looking forward to the remake, but it unfortunately just didn't scratch the itch in the end. Maybe they can update/add a few things in the future to help offset a few problems. If you're thinking of getting it, I would recommend getting it on sale.

Sure there is a beautiful world for you to explore but the emphasis here is on the story, and my word, is the story as entertaining as the original.
A great soundtrack and decent gameplay make this a successful remake.

Story: 10/10
Same as original but improved pacing, and voice work. If it is your first time playing the story you are in for a treat. Although the story does feed into some cliche's of the genre it does it so well that you hardly notice it and even if you do, you don't mind.
If you have played the original you will appreciate the voicework and graphics that elevate an already amazing story to new heights.


Music: 9/10
Great selection for setting the period and time but more variety would be appreciated - 8:10

Graphics: 9/10
Great graphics, especially when driving through the open world, you can see the attention to detail the developers put into it. 
Cutscenes and facial animations have a lot of detail put into it. 

Gameplay: 7.5/10
As I mentioned before this game can be described as a linear open world game. As the open world, although you are able to explore..you are not heavily incentivised to do so. 
The game is focused on telling a story and the open world is a tool to add depth to that story by setting the tone, setting, culture and other elements of the time period.
The game is not concerned with how you interact with the world but rather how that world can assist in adding context to main storyline. This is not a bad thing, in the contrary if you know what you're getting into you will appreciate it.

The only issue with gameplay is the gunplay. It is average at best, I had to switch to mouse and keyboard for shooting sequences as it was so bad with a controller.

I like the game, the story is really good that made me to keep going without taking a break just to know what happens in the end of the story. The way it starts mainly in the end where the main character Tommy is telling his story on how he became part of the organized crime family all the way to the present time to a detective to help him save his family is done well. 
The combat to me is average when shooting but fist fight is bad. The driving I like it very much when I set it to simulation mode as I sometimes turn crazy that I did not mean to do. 

The game is a very linear story and I don't mind since this game seems to be a story focus game that I really enjoyed in the end of the game.",1601207801,1601207801,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,140,13,780,780,761,1601209027
37,Mafia Definitive Edition,76652621,english,"I want to start with the story because it's what carries this game. With this I don't mean to underestimate other aspects of the game, because they are all on level of actual AAA games or better. There is so much detail here. Story as a whole is very well made, believable and not hard to relate to. I appreciate the detail in story telling. For example in one of the first missions when you're getting chased by Morellos guys, first you see Paulie and Sam standing in front of the bar. But in the next cutscene Paulie disappers only to came later on out of the bar with a shotgun. These small things repeat and carry on throughout the game. One feature I love is that during gameplay if something or someone interrupts the talker, he continues as soon as possible even from before he left off. Meaning you won't miss out on anything.

Graphically, I think that this is the level of detail modders are trying to achieve to this day in GTA V. The game is so beautiful but in the same time very optimized. The only issue I had with this part was that in the options there was no setting to turn up or down rendering distance. So you would see cars just appearing once they reach a certain field. This is probably one of the reasons why this game is so well optimised.

Soundtrack was re-made, but it's perfect. I've not found any similiarities other than the main theme. I have nothing else to say other than soundtrack stays on the level to support story telling. I have found myself a few themes which I will listen to in my free time.

Mission hints appear on the radar, and not on your whole screen. This means that even on hardest difficulty you can choose how you want to approach the game. To make it easy just look at the radar but if you want a challenge, simply don't and you won't have any annoying UI directing you.

Gunplay was personally very satisfying. I love the variety of options this game offers you. From gun choice, to positioning and choosing whether to go silent or guns blazing. The only problem I've had with gunplay is when you spray bullets into an enemy (not in the head obviously) but they don't seem to react to impacts so they shoot you back instantly. It made me have to repeat some missions a few times.

Other details consist of: As you drive through the streets sometimes you'll see someone tying their shoes. It can happen that you crack only the plastic of your cars back headlight, and so the light will keep on shining but without the red plastic which changes its color. Every unequal road part is a puddle. And so on.

All in all, I recommend this game even at full price. I played the original a lot when it was a hit and revisiting the story and 2020's take on the game was a great feeling.",1601207311,1601207676,TRUE,2,1,0.545454562,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,429,9,779,779,761,1601318616

* I missed the free ride extreme missions

[b]Introduction[/b]
This game captures the original’s ambience, characters’ persona, and above all crazy driving. It is an unexpected gem coming our way compared to the other two definitive editions. If there was one game that needed a remake, Mafia I was definitely desperately calling for it.

[b]Gameplay[/b]
Driving was and still is at the core of Mafia. Cars are highly uncontrollable at higher speeds so that is a real positive right there. The (in)famous car race is there, and it is just how I remember it: haunting. Lost Heaven is brought to life in a new light that is akin to Mafia II and III graphics-wise creating some sort of ‘movie-effect’. People are strolling down the sidewalks or driving their vintage car on the street: it feels like jumping back in time. Overall, citizen life has been well created. The gunplay is very fast-paced and really reminded me of the original: blood squirts and pools everywhere. Mobsters vying for power against each other in a crooked city is what this game is all about.

[b]Story[/b]
In this game you take the role of Tommy Angelo, an Italo-American man who is working as a taxi-driver in Lost Heaven city. Suddenly, shady people will involve you in their crooked business. The whole-sequence of ‘being accepted’ into the family is very well-preserved. What is also important to mention is that the cutscenes are neither boring nor badly made: it is almost like watching a movie while resting your bones from all that action that took place a few moments back.

[b]Audio[/b]
Audio quality is generally nice. However, some pistols sound more like pop-guns than anything else. Perhaps modders will be able to take care of this minor issue. However, the music, the backgrounds sounds, the sound effects are crazy good (especially the screeching wheels). Characters are all voiced by professional voice actors. This positively contributes to the ‘movie-effect’ that I mentioned before.

[b]Graphics[/b]
The visuals are really great. The city itself and its inhabitants are – to my knowledge – historically accurate. Sometimes, there were some stutters and fps drops here and there but I managed to take care of them by both disabling full screen optimization and playing on borderless.

[b]Conclusion[/b]
I really think that this game is worth anybody’s time if you are into ‘the business’. Overall, this game is solid, and I don’t have particular bad sides to state here in my review.

Thanks for reading.

61,Mafia Definitive Edition,76603294,english,"Only my second review of a video game, but Mafia is such an odd mix of good and bad that I must review it. I felt tempted to give this game a negative review, because after recently playing the original Mafia game, I can see Hangar13 have decided to pass on many of the details that made the original so loved. I must say that after some deliberation, I would never give this game a negative review, as simply the things that it gets right outweigh the things that it doesn’t, and I have actually grown to love it as one of the most memorable titles I have ever played.

Of course, I must mention that this game is masterfully designed. It is set in a massive and intricate, graphically beautiful open world that, upon first impressions (and lasting) made me sit back and smile in contentment that this team pulled off making one of the most interesting and entrancing eras in history feel so alive and bustling with energy. The details such as citizens talking about daily events, others doing jobs dressed in overalls carrying boxes on the street, others seemingly leaving work, getting in their cars and driving off... was staggering and it has really set a new standard for detail in an open world city. However, I then realised that unlike the original Mafia game, I am not able to take one of the many trams to travel around the city, nor does the El-train (elevated railway) have any functionality. In the original game, I could also take taxi fares by driving people around the city whenever I wanted, a detail I and many other fans loved. This may be more of a minor detail to some players, but to me I would have felt so immersed travelling between missions in such an alternative fashion. And now, I will make some comparisons to Mafia II, because I can.

Like Mafia: DE, Mafia II was a fantastically designed game. But the difference came with the immersion. I could go into ammunition stores and restaurants, with people in them, maybe even rob the store (I hated having to do that but it did feel more immersive), or even customise my car. One of the biggest missed opportunities in this newest edition is that this beautiful big open world has been designed… with little interactivity. Yes, there are amazing details pertaining to current affairs which can be heard on the radio, and the cars even make that tinkling sound old cars make when you turn a warm engine off. But the difference comes with Tommy’s ability to interact with the world. He can’t steal a car and make it his own like Vito could in Mafia II. He can’t change its colours or its number plates, he can’t give it decals or change the wheels, or even tune the engine because there are no tuning shops (it would help considering the speed of the 1930s land yachts). Tommy can’t even go into a clothing store so he can play with custom clothes during the story mode – they are only available in a different setting from the menu. This is a missed opportunity considering how under-utilised this era is in gaming and left me quite disappointed honestly. 

In the grand scheme of things, the story does make up for this. It is a fantastic tale about the nature of mob crime in the early 20th century… of the rivalry between different groups and the reality of the friendships that are made within them. The missions are very well crafted and immersive, and quite frankly it felt as if I was experiencing something out of a feature film. I would have liked some of them to be a little less linear (having variation in how to complete them) but that is neither here nor there. Yet while the story stays true to the original and has very good pacing, it doesn’t quite touch on the nuances of Tommy Angelo’s transformation from Cabbie to Mafia strongman. Whereas Vito Scaletta was a war-trained veteran, Tommy was not trained at all, and he can be seen a few days later shooting a gun like he’d been training for years. Definitive Edition also does not explore what really made Tommy make the decision to abandon his safe, guilt-free life of taxi-driving for the Mafia. Those initial moments should have showcased an intense struggle in Tommy’s mind, and have those moments branch out and develop in later chapters. Instead, we see some regretful expressions on his face from time to time in the heat of the moment- and nothing really pensive or long-term. Sarah is never realized as a spanner in the works of Tommy’s ‘business’, and it’s almost like he’s never made to choose between them. 

As for some of the other characters, such as Vincenzo, Ralphie and most of all Lucas Bertone, they are not fleshed out enough at all. They are introduced at the start.. and then are almost never seen again during the story. The game also never touches on the feeling of just about “making it”. What I mean by this is that Tommy never really gets a taste of the “good life”. In Scorsese’s ‘Goodfellas’, the characters experience the benefits of their actions before their whole world starts crumbling down. They experience what it’s like to be able to do anything they want before it all starts going south. This is alluded to at the start of the game with Paulie’s “did it feel good?” line, but never progresses beyond this point. I did love, however, the details in the form of letters that can be found throughout the game that add to the lore of the moment, and I loved the interactions between Tommy Angelo and Detective Norman. All-in all, the story was brilliant and intense, almost a masterpiece, albeit a bit short cutting out some missions from the original. The music of course is fantastic like all the other Mafia games, and the mission themes also lend to its intensity. However there doesn't seem to be much variation in tracks, so often you will find many missions feature the same theme in action sequences, which can get irritating after a while.

The combat is not the worst, but I much prefer the more intuitive system employed in Mafia II. This game takes the 3rd Person Shooter elements of Mafia III, and improves them… a little. There is a generous distribution of stealth sequences and full-on action combat sequences, both hand-to-hand and shooter, that are done very well, with Tommy ducking in and out of cover to gain the upper hand on enemies. This shooting system may work on an easier setting, but on ‘Classic’ setting, which I played, this just felt gratuitous and laboring, if not frustrating at times. The character’s stance doesn’t feel contained like in Mafia II or the GTA games, but awkward (seriously, he never grips a pistol with two hands?). And this coupled with the odd, inaccurate scopes for some of the guns and a seriously difficult game setting, doesn’t make for the best of experiences. Honestly, I would have even preferred a simple dot in the center of the screen like is seen in similar games. But somehow… I just kept playing regardless because of how much I loved the story and the world.

Lastly I will quickly list some details I think Free Ride mode needs to have.
- real-time weather cycles
- More detail in some abandoned/empty buildings such as broken furniture and letters describing the nature of the depression
- More public transport functionality
- prompt at the end of Story Mode to go into Free Ride mode
- shops

So this is not a perfect game and I know I have been picking on the demerits of it, but most of these are minor criticisms on what is overall, a brilliant title and a fine adaptation of an original. Hopefully some of these issues can be addressed in future releases (maybe even updates please H13?), but the thing I am most pleased about is that it stays true to the original, near exactly, and creates a beautiful open world for players to admire… listening to old classics while driving large vintage automobiles has never felt more real in any other title.

I will certainly recommend Mafia: Definitive Edition, though it may make more sense buying at a discount. I can only hope we now get a full remake of Mafia II. Because you know I'm playing it.",1601134550,1601203719,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,84,2,3232,3232,3138,1601268740

Some scenes have been changed to allow for more clarity and the emotional bond between the characters is now much more prudent than before.

The world is very beautifully modelled and extremely close to the original game! The reflections in the pools of water is outstanding and you do not need a ray tracing graphics card for that! Some of the buildings really show their age with the wear and tear on the building textures. It gives a sense of realism and a feeling of being there!

I especially like the way directions are shown in the game while driving. They pop up as road signs next to the road, which I think is very intuitive! You are no longer distracted by watching a map, although that function is still there, should you prefer it. Nicely done guys!

The police in the original game was much tougher to shake than in this version. I have found shaking the police too be too easy! There is almost no trick involved in doing so at all. Personally, I would have preferred this to be a bit more difficult.

Something that the old game had that I have never seen any other game developer do, was the ability to use the public transport in game. How Illusion Softworks (2K currently) did that I have no idea, but you could ride the trolley busses, the elevated trains and even the boats!

As a guy who played Mafia The city of Lost Heaven a lot, my first play of the Definitive Edition was only for the story.
The story is a bit changed and there are quite a lot of missions that are shortened. Some parts of the mission you don't get to play, as they are displayed as movies/intros of the missions. I won't spoil those missions. Some characters are better introduced, some not. One thing that I may see as a negative point: The actors were great, but they not seem to be natural for those characters. The original story and characters were more emotional.

A tento remake mě celkem zaujal. Celkově grafika vypadá na 2020, i když grafický nastavení hry je naprosto příšerný a potřebujete fakt dobrou grafiku aby jste do rozjeli alespoň na 60 FPS.
Příběh je upravenej, docela dost. Některý věci jsou zajímaví, jiný zase dost otravný. Vlastně skoro všechny hlášky z původní hry jsou pryč, a to že nějaký přidali? Ok, ale kdyby tam nechaly třeba jen půlku těch z originálu, byl bych spokojenej. (Neříkám že ty nový nejsou vtipný.)
Celkově atmosféra této hry je super, až na ty FPS i na nejmenší detajly, ale to se dá přehlédnout.

79,Mafia Definitive Edition,76648113,english,"A good game for those who didn't play the original Mafia but may be a little underwhelming for the fans who want to go back home. 

I've finished the game in under 13 hours playing on ""Classic Mode,"" which is the game's hardest difficulty and goes so far as to recreate the vehicle handling from the original. During my playthrough, I encountered two glitches that forced me to reload a previous save point and one crash. 

Mafia: Definitive Edition has quite a bit going for it to overcome some of its weaknesses. This game is clearly a labor of love and boy howdy, does it show. The city of Lost Heaven looks fantastic, with considerable attention being paid to bringing period-accurate vehicles, architecture and fashion to life. The voice-acting is top-notch, not a single wasted performance to be found anywhere. 

The story is entertaining but uneven. At some points, it is enthralling and entertaining. Other times, it's rushed and lacking especially as the game approaches its end where it feels the game is trying to get itself over with as quickly as possible by suddenly introducing motivations and plans to find a way to get across the finish line. However, it is largely faithful to the original game (sans cut side content) so if that's what you're looking for, you've got it here.  

If there's one thing all the Mafia games get right, it's the soundtracks and this one is no different. Though you're only limited to radio stations, each station as well as the OST that plays in certain segments are memorable and striking. Having the classic Mafia theme is just the cherry on top. 

Gameplay-wise is where Mafia: DE is at its weakest. It's a perfectly serviceable shooter in the same vein as Mafia 2. In fact, I would argue that this feels like a sequel to Mafia 2 more than anything else as the gameplay design is nearly identical with some of Mafia 3's combat being implemented here. Despite having an open-world (which there is little to do beyond collectibles), the game is largely a linear third-person cover shooter. Not much in the way of meaningful variety is here. 

Being priced at $39.99 is what I'd call fair for what you get here. I'd describe Mafia: Definitive Edition as a beautiful-looking X360/PS3 game with a story that's engaging enough to see through the end. If that's enough for you, I'd recommend the game but if you need something more grandiose and ambitious for gameplay and open-world crime, temper expectations or look elsewhere entirely.",1601201027,1601201027,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,483,4,765,765,765,1601199873

83,Mafia Definitive Edition,76581072,english,"This is one of the games that makes me wish Steam allows me to make a neutral review. As someone who played the original, the Definitive Edition leaves much to be desired.

The graphics and environment are absolutely stunning. Yet, the game feels stripped of purposes to explore. Storyline no longer takes you all around the city; Many driving of the missions are skipped with cutscenes; The side quests from Lucas Bertone are gone. The public transport from the original are barred from us now. All in all it's a shame that the developers cut these contents that make the original so beloved.

In fact, imo, the DE lacks details of the original level. Of course, the city and the graphics give much more details visually. But the details in the stories and the details in the gameplay are gone. Replacing them are the overtly-hand holding that  makes the game feels more like a film. The original shines as it allows you to make your own choices from time to time; For instance, in the mission Molotov party, you can choose to block the backdoor of the bar with a crate to earn yourself a few more minutes before you wreck the cars. In the same mission, a better car that you can collect is hidden in a garage. The remake, however, directly point you to that car. Another example is Visiting Rich People, in the origin you can have Salvatore to pick the prosecutor's car for you (which also teaches you how to pick that specific car). This is entirely optional and requires player's thinking. [strike]Or in the Running Man, where u can tell a lady who is waiting in an alley that her date got the address wrong as you found him earlier in another similar alley.[/strike] In Definitive Edition? These are all gone. The mission feels short as it forcefully holds your hand and strips you of freedom to explore the levels. This strips players like me the sense of achievement when I finish the mission in different ways (and succeed in doing so).

I like the developers' attempt to give characters more depth. But the drastic change in terms of personalities sometimes feels a bit too much. The reduction of missions doesn't help either as characters feels much less relatable, namely Ralph and Lucas. Especially since their function in game is mostly gone now. However, I do applaud the developers's effort in trying to give more insights of the era with the additional or changed dialogue.

Mafia 3's combat system is not something I like at all, but it is acceptable. With the classic difficulties, it does prove to be a fun challenge to manage your resources. So I would say the gun play is much more modern and enjoyable than the original.

All in all, Mafia: Definitive Edition has its merits, but loses on many other aspects that made the original Mafia so praised and loved. The game feels rushed, and there are many contents that felt like they were cut at the last minute. I recommend waiting for a sale at least at 50%.

87,Mafia Definitive Edition,76647273,english,"Game looks nicely, whole city is breathtaking and I think it's not used to its full potential, developers could easily make more content here. Original story is edited, so some things makes sense, I love some story changes and also hate some of them.

It's nice to see that your AI enemies can cause you problems on classic difficulty, but marker that shows you what to do destroys your experience. You can find important information hidden on secret notes, but game won't let you use your brain, but it will show marker straight on the point of interest instead. I can find box of cigars based on titles written on the ground, I can find door based on number, etc. - just let us hide the marker, at least on hardest difficulty.

There are some bugs and I don't like the way how Lucas Bertone's missions are reworked. I also don't like the fact, that Yellow Pete isn't in this game.

What's the WORST in this remake, is close-ranged combat. There are few animations that are being repeated over and over again and all it takes to fight someone is pressing left alt and then spamming Q. Whoever worked on this should be fired, because it is awful. I swear, that combat in original Mafia, created 18 years ago, was better and it wasn't even good. Also I feel that it's super easy to loose Police officers chasing you. ""Traps"", that are even marked on your mini-map are terrible and shouldn't even be in this game, but on the other hand I am glad, that traps were cinematic only in the first mission and there is a very small chance of you crashing while going through them in rest of the missions.

It's great game in overall, but there are things that could be improved, if some original Mafia maniac would work on it.

6,Mafia Definitive Edition,76644872,english,"My first mafia game was Mafia II, I'd never played Mafia I until very recently and even then I thought it wasn't much. However being bought up to standard with the Mafia 3 engine was a massive step up.

The story is good, I like it, however unlike Mafia II where everything was open world or, God forbid, Mafia III, this was very linear in a way when progressing with the story. You don't appear back at your apartment and drive to the location, no it's cutscene and then next mission which I don't have an issue with it was just odd. But the remaster or even remake is very good.

However there were quite a few issues, frame rates, stuttering, crashes, muddy graphics, and the overall reusing of many animations from Mafia III. Driving was also very Mafia III esque with vehicles having no real damage indicator unless you've thrown around the car like it was East Germany after WWII. Again I did and didn't like the way the missions transitioned but that was it.

The radio honestly made the game, I found myself purposefully driving around the mission marker to listen to the radio if there was a news report on, especially when the baseball game was on, I paid more attention to the radio then to the mission itself, and details like that made the game. However, maybe a little more research could have gone into the weapons and such, along with variety. The 1928 Thompson Sub Machine Gun is a roller block back weapon, meaning the gases released from the round send the bolt back into position to fire again, it's not closed bolt like the game depicts it, it's open. A lot of other weapons were used at the time the game was set so having just the Thompson, Springfield, 1911 and the Winchester, was a bit of let down considering the amount of weapons that were in Mafia II. 

Anyway, solid game, would recommend, perhaps a patch could come out to iron out the bugs. Also there was a massive bug where if you stream it through Discord it will cause the game to tank, maybe look into that.",1601195899,1601195899,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,138,9,793,793,793,1601195350
7,Mafia Definitive Edition,76644794,english,"First as a personal statement, I was rooting for this remake from the very beginning, because it should have been a key for Mafia IV or some other project from Hangar 13. 
I’m pleased to realize, that it is! 
Well. This game showed me a few things:

- These guys were very underestimated, they are truly a crew of talented, humble folks who were the moms and dads for the original, and in some way, this care shows in this remake. 
And yes, they don't need for a big baby, like Daniel Vávra to annoy and hold them back. 
He disgraced and been mean with his own colleagues, for no rhyme or reason, instead of helping them. And this is a fact, no matter if we respect and like him or not. 
However, I don’t want to, and nobody should judge on this because as gamers and outsiders, we don’t know the full misunderstandings and problems between them.
- Mafia III would be also this good, if 2K had not rushed them (and please understand this well, because I mean it in a helpful and constructive way). 
But also, we all have to admit, that Hangar 13 is so good if they can create story-driven games, with soul, classy acting, great soundtrack, and landscapes. 
- There is no need for a big open world if you can't fill it equally with meaningful content throughout the missions. 
  A good story with great characters and atmosphere is better mostly, this game and its predecessor are very good examples for that.
- Some game & AI mechanics need polish for the future games, the way is very spot-on, but it is a long road until the end.
- I don’t understand still, why they cannot implemented the rail and tram systems as useable transport option, it’s not a big problem, but strange. 
If someone know the reason, please let me know too.
- The delay was a wise decision, because as a result this game is optimized very well, with no or barely any hiccups or bugs.

Very Interested to see what’s next from the studio!

Mafia DE is the same game, but it is 2020 outside, and since 2002 people saw so many masterpieces that a plank for a breakthrough game now placed way too high.

15,Mafia Definitive Edition,76643704,english,"I really wish Steam would have a neutral review option as it would fit perfectly here.

For die hard fans of the original a news of a full remake was a God send I'm sure. I was waiting for a remake for years so when I finally saw the news I was beyond hyped. But now having played and finished the definitive edition I have to say I'm a bit disappointed.

So right off the bat the city looks and feels amazing. I mean, once you're out on the street you just gotta stop and take in the sights. It really looks incredible. It's got that perfect 30s gangster noire feel to it and particularly during rainy nights. The combination of smooth jazz on the radio together with the neon street signs and the rain is just perfect I loved it.
Unfortunately the game plows through the missions soooo fast that you barely have a chance to take in the sights. And here's my main problem with this remake - IT HAS TOO MUCH DAMN HAND HOLDING THROUGHOUT and it goes so fast from mission to mission that you don't get a chance to breathe and take it all in. Now, people that didn't play the original from 2002 might not feel this way but for die hard fans it will be a big problem. 
Here's the issue: what made people fall in love with the original were the small details at the time - you had optional missions from Lucas Bertone that rewarded you with cool cars - these optionals were thrown in after some of the main missions and on top of that you didn't just visit Lucas and you got your car, no, you actually had interesting side missions that gave you a great sense of accomplishment, they had weight to them and felt they were really thought out. In the remake the character of Lucas barely make an appearance in the racing mission and that's it. It renders the character completely useless. Again, fans of the original will know what I'm talking about.
The original had quite a big emphasis on the cars because the developers felt they were a big part of the game and they are, so they centered missions around them. Ralphie gave you a car before almost every main mission and taught you how to steal one unlocking the said car in your collection and of course on top of that you had Lucas' missions that rewarded you with cooler cars to complete that collection.
Here in the remake this is almost completely passed over - you can just nab any car off the street because you can brake the window and steal it - I know it's a bit more ""realistic"" but that's not the point. You just have a garage similar to Mafia 2 where you can pick the cars you already stole - the whole point of the cars is gone. 
You can't go on public transport anymore in the remake - I know it's not a game defining thing but it was a nice touch in the original - you could actually use trains and trolley cars to move around the city.
The free ride mode has no point to it - I keep seeing people mentioning that there are some hidden stuff in it but I've not found them yet. In the original you could do the following in free ride mode once you've completed the game and unlocked all free ride options - that's right, you had several options for free ride once you unlocked all of them: you could choose which part of the city you started in, you could pick between day and night time, you could choose traffic density and police density, you could pick the car you wanted to use, you could to taxi fares if you had the appropriate car, you got money for driving really fast, killing gangsters on the street or blowing up cars. And here is the creme de la creme - Free Ride Extreme - this was a free ride mode without any police on the streets that had 19 missions that rewarded you with unique hot rods that weren't available anywhere else in the game. Free Ride Extreme was a hell of a lot of fun, some of the missions were easy, some were next to impossible but doable nonetheless. In the remake this is gone unfortunately and I really hoped they put it in. Maybe in a future update who knows. This is, for me at least the biggest minus of the remake. 

Story wise it's the same as the original with some added and improved dialogue that sometimes gives some background information on some of the events. The characters have a bit more depth to them but again nothing mind blowing. I actually didn't like the way they portrayed the main character Tommy in the remake. He's much more violent and thuggish than the original. He doesn't have much remorse for his actions compared to the 2002 Tommy. Paulie and Sam are ok I guess, but again they don't carry much weight as characters compared to the 2002. I really liked Ralph this time around but I wished they made him more useful as in the original. Again, Lucas Bertone is almost non-existent which is a damn shame. He really was a cool secondary character. 

I'm gonna stop here - I could write until next year.

Bottom line is the remake is ok and worth playing through but it has a lot of shortcomings. All the things that made the original so loved by so many gamers back then are almost gone in the definitive edition. If you're a fan of the original like me you'll understand. If you've never played the original I urge you to play it but I warn you it is after all an 18 year old game so graphics and gameplay mechanics will feel outdated but you can push past that and enjoy it immensely.

Cars also don't drive like cars, but more like steel boxes on wheels, which is really strange in the game, where the protagonist is a driver.

23,Mafia Definitive Edition,76643017,english,"Id recommend getting this game due to its price, as well as generally being an above average game, below ill list my positives and negatives on it, but overall just pick it up if you're a fan of the time period, mafia fantasy, or a fan of the franchise.

POSITIVES:
- Characters: Voice acting, models, and motives of the characters are all really well done and interesting making each character feel unique and predictable as if you actually knew them.

- Graphics: The game is running Mafia 3s engine and confirms my thoughts on Mafia 3 which was me wanting it to take place as an Italian mobster in a big city; the city looks amazing with a healthy amount of detail, lighting and weather effects are great and finally the cars are really done.

- Vehicles: Cars in the Mafia franchise have always been a stand out component of the games and in this title its no different; they actually feel realistic and handle as they should on the simulation driving setting.

- Atmosphere: The city is alive, and beautiful! The radio stations do an excellent job at pulling you even further into the immersion and just driving around the city and hearing people talk in the bar makes you feel in a living world.

- Story: Ill be honest, the story is not as good as Mafia 2 which I regard as the best game all around in the series. It is predictable and sometimes drags due to the missions being: ""Go here get into gun fights that are always the same, and then boom onto the next mission instantly"". Im not saying its bad, it has a lot of great moments and the overarching story is well written; I just wish there was less of the same shooty missions and more creative missions like in mafia 2 that didn't have you doing the same thing for a lot of the missions.

Performance: The game runs great @3440p x 1440p 21:9 with max settings on a gtx 1080ti; I had no frame drops below 60.


NEGATIVES: 
- Gun play: Going back to what I said in the story section there's a lot of shooting in this game, and to be frank the gun play to me was lackluster, nothing feels impactful (shotguns come close), and the aiming just feels weird on controller (I prefer controller in these types of games), idk how to explain it but its not down to my aiming skills but just something with the accuracy of guns I guess.

- Length: I know Mafia games aren't exactly long, and that this is a remake, but I can't help feeling I spent too little time in the story, and that had it gone on for 15-20 hours with better pacing and different missions besides the same shooting one time and again, I would have felt more satisfied with the length, I guess it did its job in me wanting more, but there just isnt a lot to the game outside the story which goes by fast (8-9 hours). 

In closing; Hanger 13 has done a great job on this remake, and while this next part may be controversial to some hardcore fans of the original; I think they should release some dlc stories for us; like lets get stories about Sam and Paulie (they have a great relationship) before they encounter Tommy; or a story dlc of Tommy from the dates 1946 - 1951. Or even better a dlc of young Salieree in the 20s with Morello under the same family (hinted in game). I want to see more of this game and its characters so Hanger 13 take what you already have and show us what you can do story wise with an already amazingly developed characters and setting.

Sometimes you're in cover behind a concrete column and yet you still get hurt leading you to die.

32,Mafia Definitive Edition,76642166,english,"After 14 hours, I'm officially a made guy! I'm happy to see Hangar 13 recaptured the feeling of the original without it becoming needlessly slavish to the past. The ending wasn’t as impactful as the O.G., and that’s not just because I knew what was coming this time round, as the changes they implemented in the coda were a little on the nose. That said, I really admire how the efforts the studio made to tie the three games together, and I had a blast hanging out with the crew again after all these years. It’s a modest, but fun experience. I’m a fan of the changes they made to the original story which, for the most part, do a good job at fleshing out the characters motivations and backstory.

For issues, I think Paulie’s actor is seriously miscast and not well directed - he can’t land on a tone performance-wise and after seeing the guys’ real-life photo I think they messed up with the facial capture (possibly Covid was a factor here), but the rest of the crew are great, so even though a crucial guy mucks up the rest of the gang picks up his slack.

Lost Heaven feels so small next to New Bordeaux, and for me this remake doesn’t hold a candle to Mafia 3, where every back alley and back yard at least feels like a plausible and playable playspace unlike the facades we see here. While the latter remains remains my favorite in the series, this is no disappointment, especially since this is a discounted title with a smaller scope created in around 2 years. Even though Lost Heaven veers closer to a bog-standard mob pastiche (there’s even a building with the name “Scorsese” awkwardly plasted on the side, lol), I appreciate how low-key the overall stakes are, which is quite refreshing from its open-world contemporaries. A few of the nods to the sequels are a nice touch, and unless your driving through a tunnel, its great fun to hear mentions of both Empire Bay and N.B. on the radio.

Free ride mode has a cute side quest with Lucas Berton giving you a series of post-cards with hints you have to solve in order to track down some experimental cars. A couple of them even include some very light navigation puzzles, which is a cool deviation. Still, I prefer forgoing the speeders in favor of the heavy and durable tin cans, that feel like they going to veer out of control when taking a corner when doing anything over 40MPH.

For everyone else, the game runs really well on launch - only few visual glitches and one save rollback bug are a great launch in current year

Graphically its modern videogame, lighting is top notch but graphics could be brought up a bit

Gameplay is basically mafia 3 gunplay/health but in a linear setting in set-piece environments, no more open world exploration required to enjoy the story but it is still present if you like to drive around and collect magazines

Story is very cinematic - not surprising now but it was a big deal back in the day, a game that makes you feel like part of a movie. No complaints here, cutscenes were added instead of some more tiresome driving/travel sequences and characters feel more fleshed out. Despite being a remake, a few elements changed here and there radically change the tone of the game (spoilers ahead), [spoiler]as Tommy is no longer shown to be compassionate himself - Michelle gets to live due to Sam's intervention which then is sloppily shoved into the art gallery dialogue; many scenes that open that up such as the church shootout and the Frank conversations are done poorly and leave characters with clear holes in their development; and don't get me started on the switch of cigars/diamonds into cigars+diamonds/dope in the third-to-last mission, as it goes completely against what the original conflict/reason to betray the Don was for the protagonist while shoehorning it with an extra dialogue in the epilogue and a retcon of Tommy's death ""catching up to him""[/spoiler] but a new player won't see the difference and will enjoy the story for what it is.

Audio is pretty mediocre - music selection sucks compared to the original, and the voice actors perform ""off character"", for lack of better word.

81,Mafia Definitive Edition,76637665,english,"I really should be writing this review later in the game, but as a longtime fan of the Mafia series I want to put my two cents in now:

NOTES: I will mostly be reviewing this game based on my experiences with the original 2002 Mafia game rather than treating this as a standalone game. Secondly, Steam keeps deciding to not post my review, so this is the rushed fourth review. Third, I have only made it 3 missions in (right after the part where you take out some of Morellos guys & cars) so this review will be more of a ""first impression"" review. I will rewrite this review once I complete the game.

The first thing I noticed once I booted up this game was the amazing graphics and beautiful world. I know Hangar 13 got a bad rep for Mafia 3's graphics by some (imo Mafia 3 was great looking) but this is definitely their work. The world has a smog city vibe that perfectly encapsulates the 1930's big city look. The map is nearly the same as the original City of Lost Heavens, and the mini map has some modern amenities such as actually having the map of the city in the mini-map and having a GPS system while also keeping old Mafia's features like the police radar built in with the mini map. Along with the police radar, they also brought back the speed limiter, police chasing you for smaller crimes like speeding, and nearly dead-on yet improved mission structure from that of the original Mafia. Hangar 13's inclusion of these small details is the type of fan service a lot of other companies lack in their remakes and it makes me so happy they included things like this. 

Unfortunately, the entire soundtrack was replaced (except the main theme), BUT the actual music is really good. It’s not as good as the original Mafia's soundtrack but, again, Hangar 13 made sure that the music fit each scenario as close to the original as possible, and damn they did a great job. 

As I mentioned there are some obvious modern amenities that are to be expected that don't necessarily make the game feel better/worse but just different, such as player markers and the much less realistic acceleration of the cars. The player markers are there to make the game easier to navigate, but also dilute the in-game immersion. Having a big obvious parking space keep confusion down but sticks out like a sore thumb. Driving feels more arcadish but at the same time accidents and taking bumps in the road are far more realistic. However, the new car physics is obviously better than the old games despite the arcades feel. Just shows how time has evolved video games since the early 2000's. 

The character models look great and fit their character well. I'm really impressed with characters like Frank and Ralph as they simultaneously look the same and better than their original character models. I'm surprised with as good as the graphics are that the game runs so smooth. I'm running an 8 GB RX 480 with an i7 processor and the game runs at an average of 51 FPS at MAX settings. When I first got this game this was my biggest concern. I am REALLY happy with how well this game runs on a what I would consider an aging setup.
 
I know I mentioned that the modernization is neutral early on in this review, but there is one change that makes/breaks this remake at the same time: additional dialogue. The additional dialog makes the game feel much more alive, especially during missions. Certain things are explained better in the remake and makes following along with the finer details of the story an easier thing to do, but they also made certain characters way to ""Hollywood"" as I would call it. For example, they made it way too clear they hated Ralphie for his disability. I know I sound like a keyboard warrior but they strait up made Paulie HATE the poor guy. In the original game they did kinda make fun of him for his disability, but they really felt like they needed to make this clear in the remake, which I personally didn't like. Speaking of Paulie I truly HATE his voice. Don't get me wrong, the voice acting in this game is great, but a lot of the characters have voices that don't really match the original games and Paulie is the worse. Now you can use my nostalgia of the first Mafia game as a cripple to this argument, but Paulies voice gives me a headache. Not only does he not sounds like Paulie, but he has this weird nerdy New York accent that doesn't fit the game at all. In noticed this in Sam’s voice also but it didn’t seem as bad. I know it’s weird to complain about the voice acting considering the original was notorious for it's bad English voice acting, but the OG Tommy, Paulie, and Sam were decent, and dare I say good voice actors that really had unique voices that fit their characters well.

Some other tiny things I like to mention: A lot of streets don't have lights or stop signs; you just kinda have to figure out if it’s an all way stop or 2 way stop. Tommy with a rounded chin makes me uncomfortable. The location Vincenzo's gun ""shop"" makes more sense. Gears clank & grind way too much even for 1930's tech. Horns are much nicer and realistic but I kinda miss that funny horn the Celeste Marque 500. I didn’t test to see if the car damage was dynamic like the OG game.



TL;DR
Positives
++ Great graphics
++True to the original mission structure
++Attention to detail (speed limiter, police AI, ect)
--Paulies voice sucks
--Overly Hollywood at times

Overall this is a GREAT remake that I highly recommend to both casuals and hardcore fans. This game was worth pre-ordering and Hangar 13 has proved themselves that they can make a great mafia game.",1601182588,1601182730,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,141,20,215,215,68,1601467754

Much better Video/Image than MAFIA III.
So much architecture detail added, I am really looking forward to some DLCs otherwise these will be wasted since there are so many suburb area not visited. 
Some story detailed changed, like the video in first Chapter OFFER CANT REFUSED, in original version, the part when Sam walks out from the bar and handover Tommy the money just caught my breath, but now it just too smooth; 
And in original, in JUST FOR FUN, Tommy, Sam and Paul didn't know about the diamonds in the cigars, but now the story changed into drugs in cigars instead of Diamonds in cigars. Its the same outcome, why change it at all??? And where is part that Sam was told by Don after the score about keeping low profit before they cash out the goods, this makes Sam such an asshole instead of a cold-heart Mafia in original.
The worst part is the weapon system(ammo), MAFIA serious always break players' balls with it, but this time is the worst. Its not fun at all playing with so little ammo as I played the easy mode....

All in all, this is a good one. Reoccur the best memory in my teenage.

The stability and optomization issues from Mafia 3 are gone and the linear design of this game allows you to overlook some of the lackluster attributes of the engine somethings, however, were downgraded presumably to save time, for example almost all animations are full blown ported from Mafia 3 and somethings were left out like Tommy's mouth moving wile he is talking on a mission. 

It leaves a little to be desired and is pretty polished but I will say the redesign of some of the characters is just plain disappointing especialy the main character, Tommy, In the original you watched him go from cabbie to killer; in the remake he was a tough guy all along and it takes a good bit  of impact out of the narritive; they did make his relationship with Sarah alot less jarring and cringey so thats a plus. 

Also I don't know why but all these Italian gangsters sound Canadian.

[h1] Pros [/h1]

[*] Graphics is impressive
[*] Brilliant story with [spoiler] a bittersweet ending [/spoiler] 
[*] Gun play is a bit clunky but it's passable.
[*] Interesting characters (although I wish that I could do side quests with Ralphie or Vinny to make them even more likeable 
[*] Difficulty is pretty challenging (only if you are playing on Hard or Classic)
[*] So many collectibles (although I wish they would bring back the ""magazines"" so that I have an actual incentive to collect them)
[*] Music scores and radio music 
[*] Driving physics is awesome (only if you play it in Sim mode)

[h1] Cons [/h1]

[*] Inability to interact or do anything in Free Ride mode
[*] City is just a diorama at this point,
[*] No break in between missions (I wished we could free roam in between instead of making it a whole different mode)
[*] Hand to Hand combat is laughable especially the finishers where it felt like more of a slap on the wrist.
[*] City felt partially empty. There are more cars than pedestrians.
[*] No replay value
[*] Price tag (could've been a $40 AUD game)
[*] Lack of customisation on characters and cars

[h1] Conclusion [/h1]

I kinda wished it's more than just an original remake with updated graphics and story. This game would have more value if it have those features in Mafia 3 like the turf system and ability to free roam and do side missions. Make it so it can compete with other open world games. Little details like in Mafia 2 where we go to bistros, diners and restaurants and order food to replenish health, help fixing people's cars. Most of these things I feel like its should be added so that this game would actually worth the price tag.

6,Mafia Definitive Edition,76635218,english,"Well, the obvious thing to do is compare this game to the pinnacle of the Mafia series, Mafia 2.  So I'm going to do that for the negatives.  Positives first though.  It's a great game overall.  The story is good and engaging (and ties into Mafia 2 in a fairly surprising way).  The graphics and sound are great and the gameplay, both on foot and driving, is a lot of fun.. 
 This city is big and beautiful.  Basically, if you're a fan of the Mafia series or GTAish games in general, this is definitely worth the pick up for a clean single-player story in a very cool 30s setting.

There are two major negatives with it that are a bit related to each other.  The short versions of both:  it's very linear and there's no charm or personality to the city.  The story is presented in chapters.  Chapter starts, exposition given, objective on map, go.  Finish the chapter, on to the next.  There's nothing to do but go through the chapters.  No diners or bars to visit, no gas stations to rob, you can't buy new wardrobe and decide what to wear, you can't supe-up cars, you don't have a safe house that you can stop by, have a sandwich and a beer, change your wardrobe and move on.  Basically, all the little things that gave Mafia 2 a touch of personality and charm beyond the story are completely absent.  And it's a shame, because as I mentioned, the city is gorgeous and is practically begging for side activities.

There is a ""Free Ride"" mode that lets you explore the city.  I've only played it a bit, but there's not much to it.  You can drive around and stumble upon short tack-on objectives.  You can choose clothes from a pre-selected wardrobe of about a dozen outfits.  That's about it.

Basically, it just feels like you're playing in the city without ever getting to interact with it.  The small touches that Mafia 2 put into its experience really made it feel like you were a guy living in that city and gave that game a charm that this just doesn't have.  But on its own merits, this game is a great single-player experience.  It's just lacking the little things that would keep you from going directly to your objective once getting behind the wheel, or would keep you coming back after going through the narrative once or twice.",1601178111,1601178111,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,445,6,3046,3046,1775,1601518762

First off im a huge fan of the mafia series and shit like this has always interested me ever since I saw my first mafia themed film The Godfather so yes this is probably a lil more Pro leaning review 

Pros
-Graphics are awesome
- Great cinematics 
-REALLY good story 
-solid shooting mechanics 
- immersive atmosphere
- Very nice music from the time period also edited radio broadcasts 

Now onto the cons there really arent that many besides a few weird animation bugs and other things but nothing game breaking 

Cons
- as stated previously Wonky animations can happen lets say if your near a wall and you do a take down you can fuck the animation 
- Driving in this game with 80% of the cars feels like your driving a tank on roller skates (although this can be adjusted with the driving options From simulation to regular regular is easier to drive but I went for simulation becaaaause ..... hell idfk im a masochist or some shit)
- sometimes the AI will bug out and continuously walk into a wall or a car or something dumb like that although pretty rare 

I hope this helps people decide to either buy the game or not or even wait for a sale have a good day whomever reads this also add onto this review if you think it would help someone decide to either get this game or not but I personally rate this very high and anyone who loves anything mafia should 100% play this game",1601175850,1601175850,TRUE,1,0,0.505327225,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,141,14,675,675,675,1601174914

Came back from class to my best friend who let himself in my dorm room playing the original in college while some bored girls watched because apparently all the illicit things we did in the dorm room drew girls attracted to danger and their judgy protective friends. 

Free ride! Do illicit things in your dorm room and shoot gangsters in a video game.

Now I'm a single dad with custody in a big house who only does legal stuff.

Free ride! Reminisce about doing illicit things and cute judgy protective girls and shoot gangsters in a video game.

Oh right, the game review:

Cons:
- The race mission. I beat it 2nd try in the original then for some reason lost my progress and then it took me 2 days. Eventually they patched it so that you could skip the race. They should probably do that again. If you're having trouble in classic mode (where the lead cars go faster than you and you have to luck out and place 3rd by the middle of the 2nd lap so that the 2 cars in front get killed by scripted events, 1 per lap), change to easy for the race and it's easy so long as you have spent an hour learning things like ""don't go into the sand on the first turn."" You might lose a badge or something, who cares, badges are for college kids.
- I missed riding the elevated trolley near Salieri's place.
- I missed having money and then having the police take it from you for speeding.
- The manual mode is great but lots of times you get in a car and it starts out in 3rd gear. I got to the point i could switch it to 1 fast. FYI To reverse go lower than 1 to R and then press W. I am still reallllly not used to pressing forward to go backwards in a car.

Pros:
- The cops are no longer some crazy big brother nightmare that descends upon you out of the blue for hitting the fender of a bad 2002 AI car that basically juked you into hitting it. Even the most benign return drive could get you killed in the original.
- Driving is mostly skippable if you give yourself the option. I only skipped a few times when the radio went to music and I got bored of driving. FWIW FDR was a boss president, listen to that radio.
- They did a damn good job updating everything. The violence is satisfying.
- They added some checkpoints but not too many.
- I don't usually care about cutscenes but they were amazing. Like a good movie.

The race mission is unbeatable for the majority of players. There is zero excuse in 2020 to not add a Skip Mission option. 

If you manage to find a save from someone who by now surely has bloody hands and went through an entire bottle of Excedrin to get it, and you attempt to finally enjoy this dumpster fire you just wasted $40 on, then your reward is the very next mission being a giant glitch fest. Walking next to a certain character, you start to slowly tilt sideways until you fall through the map. Then, after what feels like walking through sludge because these characters move at a snails pace, you get to the part where you have to beat up a bunch of thugs, and since the melee is absolute sh!t, you will have a horrible time repeating the mission over and over. Finally, you manage to get past it, and then you get to fight a bigger thug, and guess what? Yep! ALSO GLITCHED. You'll break your keyboard trying to take him down because he won't go down. He will, however, drift through a fence, turn transparent, or freeze in place. 

Now bear in mind, this is all only going to happen if you even get past the freezing and the crashing. 

So, I ask you: Do you enjoy throwing money in the trash? Then sure, buy the game for aesthetic alone because that is the ONLY positive part of this dumpster fire. 

The people enjoying this and lying in their reviews are the 2002 fanboys wearing rose colored glasses, on their knees giving Hangar 13 the time of their life, OR the neckbeards wanting to be a part of something. If anyone says this is GOTY material, have them committed to a mental institution, ASAP.

38,Mafia Definitive Edition,76573823,english,"I was a huge fan of the original and while this is a good update, especially in graphics, there is a lot to be desired. At launch there is a glitch that causes the game to freeze when trying to run the game from the steam launcher so I had to find a work around. (launch from steam's big picture mode located in the top right corner of steam) If you play with a mouse and keyboard you probably will need to remap a lot the the bindings as they were completely unplayable in their default settings for me. *Minor spoilers ahead* The most jarring thing for me though is that they have completely changed the look, voices, and personalities of Tommy, Paulie, Sam, and Frank. For the worse in my opinion. In the original Tommy seemed very reluctant to join the mob, was kind of forced in by circumstance but never really embraced the life. In the remake, he seems to have a kind of bloodlust from the start. Paulie and Sam both come off extremely unlikable. For example. In the original the three used to get along really well with Ralph the mechanic with a stutter. Ralph cracks a small joke at Paulie's expense and the two laugh it off. In the remake Ralph cracks the same joke and Paulie goes off screaming at Ralph. While as of this review I have not finished the game, the changes they have made, especially to the characters have been very off putting. While it is still not a bad game I was expecting better. Especially since I've been looking forward to this remake for quite awhile.

Edit after finishing story: They have completely stripped the guts out of a few of the missions. Replaced a lot of driving sections with cutscenes, removed the ability to use the trolly and L-train, removed most of the small conversations with Ralph and Vincenzo, and removed all of the optional side missions with Luca Bertone including Ralph and Luca how teaching you how to lockpick different cars as the years go by.

50,Mafia Definitive Edition,76630703,english,"As someone who has played the original atleast once a year since it's release I played this one with some biases for the old one.

What this version does better:
Character development. You get a somewhat better insight to their personalities and the story is reworked to explain to the player why they take the choices they do, better than the original in this regard.


Overbearing negatives: Story is fast phased, way more so than compared to the original. A lot of travel time is cut, even the map reworked to get you from point A to B way faster and a lot of travel is just replaced by cutscenes or loading screen time. For new players it's probably a positive as you're delivered to the action, but as a player of the original it feels as though everything is too rushed and you don't immerse yourself quite as much.
Also a ton of content like side missions to steal cars is not in the game and also little flavor things like picking up your own weapons from a dealer isnt here either, though it was only available on 2 missions in the original. 


Reworked mission positives and negatives: During the Omerta mission I noticed I could stealth all the way avoiding to kill anyone except this one guy I knocked out. I thought it was a nice touch to be able to stealth around a lot. In other mission as well I found you had the option to not go guns blazing. 

Other missions are reworked for the worse, like where you break into the prosecutor's home. In the original you could choose to go by a side door or the front and leave without alarming the guards. In the definitive version it's just one way in, the level is overly simplified and in the end you're not given the option to just leave quietly.


Combat positives: the original did not have a cover system. 
Negatives: The enemies are bullet soakers, they take 2-3 bullets in the torso and hardly reacts. In the original a bullet whether to the leg, arm or torso stopped any man in his tracks and it was the same for the player. A single thompson round hit you and you'd be stuck taking all the other bullets until the shooters drum was empty. 

Perhaps a bit morbid detail but a nice one for added realism was that in the original sometimes when you downed a guy they would try to crawl away, then you could either let them bleed out or give them mercy with a bullet in the back.

The overall feeling of different guns here is like they're all the same. A 357. magnum in the original actually felt it had power behind it, it lets out a big bang and after a round the recoils pushes the sight so hard you're firing at birds if you tried to rapid fire. In this one however most pistols feel the same. 

Also the great amount of molotov cocktails encountered is obviously to punish the player from not cheesing with the cover too much, but in my biased view it was immersion breaking seeing it thrown around so much.

From where i should start? Probably i'll start from a moment when i've played original game for the first time. It was far 2002. A time when wee Kilroy, after school was enjoying playing some rubbish video games. (i'm still enjoying playing rubbish video games lol)

Back to subject.
Let's have a small talk about the original first. So what this game was famous for back then?

- Strong plot & chapters. 
Plot was absolutely great for that time. Story in the tradition of good ol' Gangster movies. Fairplay was a pain in ass till the ""day 1 patch"", but still was possible to pass.(compare to the remake) not much to say about most of the chapters - they are just good. Except for Bon Appetit and A Great Deal! those chapters are ""fantastico""!
Not bad amount of side missions provided by Luca.
Freeride - it was almost pointless, but still you could have some fun there. Make some money. Start fight with cops & sreet gangsters and watch them killing eachother from the safe distance.
Freeride Extreme - Funniest shit i've ever played. Each mission was difficult fun and funny as hell. the prize on a complition of the mission was a new bizzare car for Freeride.

- Attention to the details. 
Bullet holes left on cars, walls or any other surfaces wold remain for a while. Bullet casings would remain lying on the ground aswell as blood and dead bodies. Stunning cutscenes with alot of details aswell.

- Each detail had its own purpose. 
As an example - Yellow Pete. Yeh, from one side totally unnecessary character to the plot. Put an unnamed gun dealer, would be the same. From the other- Paulie knew him scince Great War. Also - Where Paulie and Tom would get themself guns like Thompson and police issue Shotgun? (never explained in remake btw, because who gives a fuck about the details these days? They... Uhh... LOOK WHAT'S THAT OVER THERE! AN UFO. sorry you missed it, anyways Paulie and Tom had spare guns in the trunk all the time... ""but where did they get them from?"" SKIP)

- Characters.
Sam - was loyal to family and family only from the beguin with, his conscience wasn't torturing him at all. He basically didn't care about anything but business, money and loyalty to the Don. His loyalty to friends was just a mask to keep himself alive.
Paulie - hot-headed 45+ years old WWI veteran. His motto is ""Do first, and think after"" (he was the oldest of trio)
Tom - one moment just a cab driver, another - and he already took out Both of Morellos. He joined the family only because he had no other choice. He didn't want any of this. His conscience was reminding him that everything he's doing aint right, and he need to quit somehow. But his conscience wasnt a problem with doing his job. Yes, sometimes he hesitated like with taking out that gang of the rapists, or Frank, or Whore. But only because he was questioning himself ""what am i doing?""
Don Morello - Typical evil mob boss, but it doesnt mean that he was not interesting at all.
Sergio Morello - smart but cruel bastard.

- Gunfights
Gunfights were slow and any mistake would get you killed stright away, becasue enemies were doing the same amount of damage as the player.

-Weapons
Weapons were deadly, and really felt like weapons. Most of the guns would one shot headshot anyone.(except for Colt Detective Special. that gun was doing about 10hp demage per shot, and also something was wrong with the headshot damage modifier(critshot) so for some reason needed about 8 shots to the head to take someone out lol)
Thompson was useful, it had decent amount of demage, and could take out anyone with - 6-10 shots. As a ""nerf"" i had hard recoil, but hell - it's tommygun after all.

- Vehicles
Probably biggest part of this game after gunfights and guns. Cars felt like carts of that time - heavy and slow.

- Soundtrack
Yeah, even there was no radiostations at all, there was still a good amount of music playing during missions. And thos compositions are still good.

- Graphics
i mean, yeah after 18 years it looks not that great. But it's still was one of the beautiful games of that time. It's still possible to play it, because of countless graphics mods out there.


Now about the remake Shitmake.

- Plot
... I mean... yeah, partically plot are the same. As a dismembered person in the eyes of maniac. Some changes were reasonable - some were not.

- Chapters
I mean... yeah it copies original and all, but why the fuck you'd changed stuff that made sense to the story? Don't get me wrong, some changes are good. But most of them are bizzare and dumb.
Yellow Pete - gone. Just gone. Where Tom and paule get guns for the robbery - fuck knows.
Lot's of smaller details - flushed down the toilet, also forget about funny side missions provided by Luca. They are gone. Instead, you'll be searching for cars from the photos and collecting comic books. ""It's alot more fun.""
Fairplay - chapter are rubbish pile of shit, because car physics was copypasted from Mafia III.
A Trip To The Country - Not going to lie - some changes were good. BUT they totally ruined chasing sequence. Cops can shot at you through the side of a truck now. ""what's wrong with that?"" you'll ask. You can't turn cam there to answer. maximum angle of a turn is 90 degrees, while cops will be shooting at you sometimes from 110-120 degrees completely covered from eyes by the sides of truck. That's what the fuck is wrong.
Omerta - Tom spared Frank only because his conscience ring him again, and said ""its going to be right thing to do"" not because Frank and Tom were good friends. only because it was right thing to do. Fuck off.(also Tom kept counting books.... why the fuck for? ah, so he could betray family later, of course.)
Death of Art - Sam was loyal to Paulie and Tom, because he was loyal. And betrayed them because he betrayed them. There is no strong reasons for him to be loyal to Paulie and Tom from the beguin with, and no reasons to betray them either.
Freeride - Useless. Even running away from cops ain't that fun.
Freeride Extreme - just got cut. Who the fuck would want to play some funny bizzare missions?


- Attention to the details. 
Five words - Mafia III. Same shitty quality.

- Characters.
Sam - for some reason grew a loyalty to Paulie and Tom. Also he is just whining everytime because of anything. Hmm... also that setup with Whore... ""dont kill her because i like her. Few chapters later - i killed her"" cool. Such a ""good"" change.
Paulie - still hot-headed, but now also whiny moron with no brain. ""Typical friend"". No longer a WWI vet with some skills for that work, because he's too young.
Tom - grew just a gigantic conscience without any fucking reason. Just because it's ain't right what he's doing, but he still going to join family to have his revenge over Morellos goons. Brilliant.
Don Morello - Become even more typical evil mob boss, aside he's looks like a giant gorilla, he is now beating the shit out of people himself (that unlucky driver doesnt count it was in the original aswell, but with less braindead reason to beat the shit out of him)
Sergio Morello - aside that he looks like a rapist now, he doesn't seem having alot of brains in his pisspot he call a head.

- Vehicles
Copypasted physics from Mafia III crosses out everything. Yeah, they look absolutely stunning, graphics itself are wery beautiful in this game. But for the love of god, who the fuck lubed their tires with Durex Lube? Slippery as hell with no fucking reason.

- Soundtrack
Good, really good. They even added two radiostations, and thats a plus. Also ""old-new"" ost sounds great aswell.

- Graphics
It's a good thing that engine evolved alot since Mafia III. City and outskirts are very beautiful. Aint much more to say. It's just beautiful.

I played this game first when I was in high school and loved it. Awesome characters, story, setting.

Now when the remake came out, maybe I had my expectations TOO high, but doesn't mean it's a great game.

It was fun going through the game in a new game, if you get what I mean. I finished the game in about 12-13 hours, the 32 hours played is because I had the game running when I went to work/bed time. 

It's short because you want more, you want this story to go on more, kinda wish for a DLC with extra story or side quests or whatever, just to go around being a gang member. I've played all the trilogy and still, Mafia 1 is the best out of the three for me

Anyways, just to break down the things I don't like about the game: (I finished on the hard difficulty)

- Tommy gun hits softer than a nerf gun
- Pedestrians don't look before they cross
- You're going to be careful with ammunition, you will be running around looking for guns more than shooting the guys
- The ammo system in original mafia was more realistic. IE, if you had 3 bullets in your handgun (the 1911)/21 ammo on hand and you reloaded, you would have 7/14 because they subtract the actual ammo chamber, not individual ammo like you would work a revolver or shotgun. Which I loved. However in this game it's just standard game ammunition system. You have 3/21 and you reload you'll get 7/17.

Other than that, it was fun and I had a blast reliving the past.",1601167513,1601167513,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,36,1,1903,1903,1903,1601167105

81,Mafia Definitive Edition,76628789,english,"[h1]Review by huge Mafia 1 fan[/h1]
[b][u]Introduction:[/u][/b]
The year was 2002 and a small Czech studion released their game Mafia: The City of Lost Heaven. Back then I was only 6 years old and haven't heard of it. It was 3 years later in 2005 when I've seen the game for the first time at my friends place. Immediately I knew that I want to play this. So I grabbed all the money I saved and begged mom to buy it for me. Since the year 2005 I have always played Mafia 1 at least once a year. And then after 18 years since release they announced remake...

[b][u]Story:[/u][/b]
A lot of people already knew the story of Mafia 1 and no one knew how much is it going to be faithful to the original. We've been told that the story will be expanded. Did they succeed? Yes, they did. The story is as amazing as it was in the original. Almost everything stayed and a lot of things were explained that made complete sense if you thought about it. In every mission you can await exactly what you know from the original but there is going to be something new. Maybe new ending to the mission or you're going on the mission with someone else. If you were afraid that Hangar 13 butchered the story you don't have to be.

[b][u]Gunplay:[/u][/b]
The game was build on enchanced Mafia 3 engine. So does it work and does it feel enjoyable to play the game? I would say yes. Of course here are some flaws that made me a bit dissapointed. The biggest issue for me is probably the gunplay. Don't get me wrong. The weapons feel great and so does the shooting. But the weapons sometimes behave really strange. You aim at someone and shot but you're missing every shot or your targets acts as if they were bulletproof. Headshots are instakill so go for them. The cover shooting style of the game is fluent and feels natural although the cover doesn't prevent all the damage you take if any part of you is exposed so you have to be careful where do you take your cover. Not a big fan of the instant molotov and granade throws but whatever. It's something you can live with. That goes for the instant pistol reloads. It feels weird how fast you can reload them and when you start reloading your Tommy gun it feels like eternity. Also I have no idea who thought that circular crosshair is a good idea for pistols. Melee combat is as simple as it can be. You press one button for punching and one for dodge as it was in Mafia 2. Every gun and weapon in the game has unique finishing moves that look great.

[b][u]Driving:[/u][/b]
If you are playing on the classic difficulty as I am and you loved driving in Mafia 2 you're going to love this aswell. It feels almost identical. Driving is a huge part of the Mafia games so having a bad driving model would suck. But that's not the case. Driving feels great, enjoyable and realistic. Every car behaves differently. That goes for driving during sunny day or raining afternoon aswell. Plus with the large amount of cars and motorbikes you're never going to be bored of driving them. They've kept most of the cars from the original game and the newly added fits perfectly. The only negative that I have for driving cars is the shooting. Nothing is wrong with shooting while driving but I don't understand the need of autolock on targets. I get it that it's for console players but the possibility to disable it would be appropriate.

[b][u]Graphics:[/u][/b]
Graphics are outstanding. No one can deny that. Everything was build with huge amount of detail and it can be seen everywhere. It almost feels too real to be a game. The new lightning engine is stunnig and feels great when switching for example from indoors to outdoors. Everything gets even better at night. Night is the time that the lights really shine. The light reflextions in small puddles of water or from your shining car paint looks amazing. Whole city and countryside is just stunning. And don't get me started with the looks of all those cars. The fact that they gave us so many of them in such detail and with the option to change varieties. During my play I haven't run into any graphical bugs, glitches or poorly rendered objects and that made me really happy.

[b][u]Characters:[/u][/b]
When it comes to characters I have to say that Hangar 13 did a great job in choosing the right actors. Most of them fits perfectly their roles. That goes especially for Tommy, Sarah, Frank and Ralph. Tom's partners Paulie and Sam create perfect atmosphere in every mission you are with them and you can genuinely tell how good of a friends they are. Don Salieri and Don Morello feels a bit young for my taste but that's probably because I'm used to og ones. I'm glad they kept all the characters that we know from the original and that they tried their best to resemble them as much as possible. Only thing that made me a bit upset and sad is that you don't get to meet Lucas Bertone that much since his side missions were scrapped and replaced by photos of places where you can find new interesting vehicles. Also Yellow Pete is not present in the game.

[b][u]Sound:[/u][/b]
Part of every game is soundtrack. Soundtrack is something that you listen to through the entire game and often is something you remember the most. The original game had amazing and memorable music. So how's it for the remake? The game has new score with some returning songs and of course the legendary opening theme was re-recorded for the game. I must say that I like the new soundtrack. If it was casual driving or life thrilling shootout, the music felt great. It's probably not as memorable as the OG Central Island or Chinatown music, but still very enjoyable to listen to and it fits the era.

[b][u]Performance:[/u][/b]
During my play I haven't run into any major bugs or glitches. Game never suddenly crashed and FPS were always stable during every part of the game. With graphics this good I was a bit afraid how my pc is going to handle all of it and if I'm not going to cook some eggs on my card while playing. Wasn't the case. The game runs well. Maybe too well. If anyone is interested my GPU on highest settings never passed 60°C (RTX2070S).

[b][u]Rating:[/u][/b]
+ Story is movie quality worthy of prizes
+ Cars and driving feels better then most of new car games
+ Likeable characters that will win your heart
+ Tons and tons of nice and authentic collectibles
+ Freeride with 'extreme freeride' missions

- Gunplay is sometimes a bit wonky
- You can carry only two firearms and one melee weapon at a time
- HUD can't be turned off and the yellow quest marker is all the time on your screen
- Some missions are a bit too rushed

[b]Final rating - 9.0/10.0[/b]

[b][u]Conclusion:[/u][/b]
When they announced the remake I was hyped and scared and the same time. Is it going to be good? Is everything going to be as it was in the original? Will there be any huge changes to the story? I'm glad that I can say all of this was just speculations and the final game is amazing. I haven't enjoyed any game this much in a long time. For me as a hardcore Mafia 1 fan Hangar 13 did honorable job with this remake. Yes there are some flaws here and there but it's nothing significant. Yes the game could have resemble Mafia 3 less. Yes they could add more missions, side quests and open world features. But we should all remember that this was a passionate project for a lot of people who worked almost 20 years ago on the original. Hangar 13 had a huge target on their head after what happened with Mafia 3 and going for a remake of a game that is by Czech people considered a national treasure can be a big bite. But they made outstanding work on the remake and if you look at the game just for a second without those nostalgic glasses and stop comparing everything to the original, then you're going to see a fantastic game with an amazing story, beautiful city, lovely music and memorable characters and missions. As a person who grew up playing original Mafia 1 and knows every corner of it.. thank you Hangar 13 for this remake.

85,Mafia Definitive Edition,76623500,english,"I don't write many reviews, but had to on this one, as the original was one of my favorites for years.

Honestly, I was expecting more from a game entitled ""Definitive Edition"". The graphics, of course, are a huge step up from the original. But, and that's a big but, that's about the only improvement over the original. I did enjoy the voice acting, and of course, the story. What I didn't enjoy, in terms of graphics, was the lip sync. Very rarely did the motion of the lips even closely match the words coming out of any of the character's mouths. I know its a little nitpicky, but it's one of those things that should accompany graphical improvement.

Now the glaring issues, and the reasons my expectations were dashed to pieces:

1. The story matched the nearly matched the original, but was entirely linear. In the original, it was possible to explore between missions, but this important detail was completely omitted. One mission leads to the next, and the next, and so on, with no breaks in between. Any ability to use public transport outside of a single late-game cut-scene is also gone. As a result, any and all side missions, including Lucas' car theft missions were removed. Although, they do exist in Free Ride. Which leads to the next issue...

2. Free ride was incredibly boring. The days of rival mobsters wanting to gun you down in the street are gone. Really, with the exception of seeing the sights (with a few missions, should you choose to accept them), there really is nothing but causing chaos. Kinda like in GTA when you get bored, except the cops act like they're volunteers, giving up way too easily. I had five stars at one point, broke line of sight for 30 seconds (with several cops about five feet from my hiding spot) and apparently I had escaped. Leading me to my next point.

3. Cops. I remember in the original, the speed limiter was your best friend on- and off-mission. If you drove more than 5-10 MPH over the limit while passing a patrol car, sirens and lights popped up behind you. Pull over, you get a ticket. If you ran, however, there would be a warrant out for your arrest. In this version, I started with the speed limiter, only to realize I could literally speed by any cop in the city and be completely ignored. The only reason they would take any interest in me is if I either ran into them or a civilian car. And it generally had to be pretty hard. Directly in front of them. But only on weekends between 11 am and 1 pm. At least that's how it felt. In the original, there were times I would debate on accepting the ticket, or ventilating them where they stood. Hangar 13 seemed to have made the cops nearly impotent, which in a game where you are part of a criminal underworld, is exactly the opposite of what you want.

4. Lastly, the controls. Movement felt delayed, almost as if moving through syrup. You want to turn left? Wait for Tommy to turn. Oh, wait. You realized you needed to go right? Delay as he considers what right means. There were several times I was killed simply because of the delay. Not only is there a delay, but he also takes two or three large, uncontrollable steps if the directional button is pressed for longer than a quick tap. Which makes getting to cover tedious at times. Especially getting into cars. Step to the back door, but not quite in the range of the front door. Move. Now your standing next to the fender. Then you're dead. The mouse controls also had issues in the menu and in-game. It felt like mouse smoothing was defaulted on medium-high and was more of a swing than a controlled movement. This made gunfights difficult at times, especially at a distance. 

If you're looking for a crime themed game involving mobsters in the ""good-old days"" with a good story, you'll probably enjoy it. However, if you're a fan of the original and looking for an honest remake of a ground breaking classic, look elsewhere. The term ""Definitive Edition"" should be reserved for games that include the original mechanics and features (and generally some extra features that add content and/or improve the game), not removing them at the expense of graphical improvement or whatever other reason. 

I was wholeheartedly disappointed that the game went from a well thought out open world to a completely linear story line with no ""if's, and's, or but's"". I commend Hangar 13 for updating a loved classic, but for the love of all things criminal, at least don't oversell something that's underdeveloped and mediocre at best. Maybe I shouldn't say underdeveloped, as there weren't any game breaking bugs, but it certainly was underwhelming.

As much as I loved the story and all the nostalgia it gave me, I can't recommend this game simply on principle. As the saying goes, ""Don't fix it if it ain't broke"". Unless, of course, the title doesn't match the content. Then go ahead and fix away.

89,Mafia Definitive Edition,76628232,english,"Should you play it? Yes.
Should you play it on Classic? That's a different question.
Considering I played and finished [only] Classic difficulty I believe it suffers from a lot of problems that needs to be reviewed.
Checkpoint system is rather bad, the way it switches objects (enemies, players etc) around without any regard to where they originally were.
Driving on gamepad is a must, while most of the times you need keyboard+mouse for shooting parts. You'll have to accept gamepad hotkeys on UI that won't switch on the fly (like most modern games do).
Ammunition is so low that it requires you to only go for headshots unless you wish to run around trying to collect some ammo.
AI is ok, I guess, but they have rather fast reaction time, so it gets frustrating eventually. Besides that they barely do anything even if sometimes they try to maneuver around.
Weapon sound design is boring and bland, sadly.
Visually it's fine, on the level with Mafia 2, city could've been prettier.
Shooting enemies is not fun as there are only so many times when you can finally spray and pray for awhile. It feels like this system probably has been inherited from Mafia 3.
As promised you don't have much health and you don't regenerate much health, so in prolonged fighting you can sometimes reload after death to be almost immediately killed.
I can't recall much of the original Mafia story, but overall this interpretation is fine. Voice acting is good but plot itself is lacking additional depth. By the end of the game plot gets a little annoying at times. To be honest Mafia 2 overall felt better by the end of the game.
Sandbox - non existent and it's best to just skip all the useless driving around or better yet, listen to dialogues and then skip it.
It's a linear mission based game (which is fine) so open world only exists for you to hide and run away from cops but also to driver around between missions.
Stealth missions in general are rather primitive and are nothing more than a time sink.

Overall I kind of liked it and it had also frustrated the hell out of me by questionable gameplay decisions and implementations.",1601165903,1601166024,FALSE,1,0,0.461006522,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,275,39,1288,1288,1288,1601163201
90,Mafia Definitive Edition,76627602,english,"Before I begin I have to warn you. This review will contain SPOILERS for the story, so if you somehow didn't play either this or the original please procede at your own risk.

Now that that is out of the way, let's jump into it.

I've been a victim of the hype train ever since this remake got announced and pre-ordered on day one (yes I know...). The first Mafia is the game from my childhood that I remember the most. I've played throught the original 17 times from start to finish. I've collected all of the cars in the Free Ride Extreme and I know everything about this masterpiece, so I understandably got really excited for it's revival with perfected graphics and updated gameplay. However I didn't trust Hangar 13 one bit. My apologies ladies and gentlemen who devoted their time to create this. It's truly a joy to play through this, even if there are some things I dislike. Great job!

The graphics are incredible. The cutscenes are fantastic and the characters look almost real. This is where the game really shines. It just looks amazing and it also runs pretty well. It didn't crash on me once and my 1060 kept it over 40 fps on max settings with Motion Blur off without breaking a sweat.

I played through the game on Classic difficulty and I can say that's it's as hard, if not harder than the original game. The enemies pick you off like they're supersoldiers, they eat up lead you shoot their way and don't even care you're shooting them most of the time. Some sections feel very easy and some are extremely difficult, like the one section in the harbor where you get to a big choke point and the enemies have all the advantages over you. It took me a while to take them all out without dying.

The story is mostly the same, but some improvements were made here and there to make it a little more fresh and make it flow a lot better. One change I like was the missions not always starting at the Salieri Bar. Omerta starts you off at a little park for example. There weren't any changes that I particularly disliked, except for the little angry monologue Don Salieri had about the hooligans that gave Sarah trouble, the original had much better atmosphere. Overall the improvements made were very tasteful and sometimes even needed. I appreciated them. I also enjoyed all the added  cutscenes and more of Sarah. The original game didn't really give you a lot of her story and I enjoyed her as an important character.
I have never played the english version, but in the Czech one they kept a lot of the old voice actors which I really liked. I knew Tommys voice actor was coming back, but the voices of Paulie and Sam pleasantly surprised me.

The map is mostly the same except for some minor adjustments to make it ""easier to navigate"". All they really did was an addition of a little road on the Central Island to make the turn there faster. They also changed a few roads leading up to the Salieri Bar. It felt like I was just going straight for the most part, I didn't really have the feeling I got when driving around on the old map, some of the turns just weren't there to make the driving easier for new players and people who don't enjoy the downtime in-between the action segments. The addition of the navigation system bugged me a little at the start, but I got over it since people who wanted to play through the original, but got put off by the age will definitely enjoy it.

The cars felt and looked great. And most importantly they're all here! From the Bolt Ace all the way to the Culver Airstream. They look familiar and drive nicely even though the brakes seemed a little too effective. It might just be the camera effects though. Just stay far away from bikes please. For your own safety. 
And since we're talking about driving, let's talk about ""Fairplay"". Oh boy is it difficult. The first half is smooth enough, you get enough time to deliver the car and also to take it back and it doesn't misbehave too much on the way back either. The race tells a different story however. It's ruthlessly difficult. The car just doesn't want to go the way you want it to go, the other racers all have better acceleration and can also take the turns much faster. Your only hope is overtaking as many of them as possible in the first two turns, otherwise you lose.

The gunplay was the most notable change. There were many elements of the new gunplay I liked. The cover system is a great addition since the enemies are really deadly and Tommy is not too resistant against their bullets. However it felt too much like Mafia 3 and that's definitely not good. The throwables were also very lazily done and I only used them in Molotov Party. The way they work took me out of the game and the animation is just truly terrible. Too quick and just straight up lazy. The guns felt relatively okay apart from the Tommy gun. Where's the recoil on that thing?
The melee combat also got a huge overhaul. By that I mean press ""Alt"" when it asks you and then spam ""Q"" until the guy drops unconscious. The finisher animations didn't really fit, but they weren't too distracting so I'll give them a pass. I can see why they made all these changes, they gave the combat a dynamic feel and they improved it a lot in many ways.

One other change is the addition of collectibles to the game. They're in the form of either cigarette cards or magazine covers and they are pretty to look at and give you a reason to explore the well structured and detailed environments. Getting all the foxes will probably take me a while since I got my first one in the very last mission, and there's 50 of them!

And now for my biggest disappointment. [b][u]This one contains a spoiler for the ending, so skip it if you didn't finish the game yet![/u][/b]

The story keeps a great pace and manages to suck you in just like the original did. It's expanded and improved and it flows really well. Up until the last moments of the game. I feel like having Tommy talk to his family when he's bleeding out on his front lawn adds nothing to the atmosphere and is just out of place. The cut to him just lying there with his family running to help conveys a lot more emotion. However the biggest problem arises as soon as the game fades to black and the credits start rolling. 
Why? WHY?! Why did you have to screw it up like that? All you had to do was play the main theme and I would be satisfied. Instead you play an out of place song that immediately took me out of it and ruined the ending. You have the player in the palm of your hand with one of the most powerful videogame endings and you throw it away with the most important detail. I really don't understand it one bit. I can say with complete confidence that I hated it. I hate what you did with the ending music. It's just not good and I hated it.
[b][u]That's the end of the spoilers... You can continue from here.[/u][/b]

The original is not only about the story though. You also get to explore the wonders of Lost Heaven in Free Ride and Free Ride Extreme. In this one these two modes got fused together to create what I would describe as a perfect blend. I really hoped they would keep FRE, but I didn't think they actually would. I was really surprised when the note that lead me to a phone booth in Little Italy turned out to be an FRE mission. I failed it like 5 times from the excitement. I'm so incredibly happy the gamemode is in the game. It was the most fun I had with Mafia for sure. Unique missions and great rewards in the form of cool vehicles. I wish I had the ability to control the amount of police patrols, but they don't really disturb you too much. And besides, you can just pay your fine and get on with your day, they seem to be present only when you're not in a mission, so that's good at least. The gamemode adds a lot of replayability. The game would not be the same without it.

If you enjoyed the writing or the gameplay in the original, this remake is not for you. But as a good looking, but dumb action game, it's tolerable.

As a fan of Mafia 1, I have huge buyers remorse here. The game is a good looking depression era driving simulator, but everything else is worse.
The writing is dumbed down and rushed, the story is rewritten and presented as a dumb but cool gangster action movie. The writing of the original's story is not here. The movement and shooting are subpar console trash. Full price is way too much for it. Gameplay is literally a quick afterthought overall, missions are cut down, entire driving sections that were in the original is not present in the remake. They shortened the missions so the average player can finish the game quicker. Very disappointing.

They shove a fucking advirtesement in your face about the trilogy pack every time you start the damn game and in order to permanently dismiss the message you have to hold a button for a good 5 seconds.

There's an INSANE amount of ghosting on any moving character models, which can't be fixed in settings. The graphics are generally underwhelming in my opinion, the game looks like it came out in 2016.

I knew every twist and turn and how it all ends thanks to the original game, but Definitive still had me hooked from beginning to end because the game never waned in making every aspect of the world feel alive and real. They did kinda bitch out on 2 chapters though but it's not a problem if you've never played the original.

There is still some jank in Definitive, but unlike the original, the jankiness of Definitive Edition doesn't inhibit your ability to play or enjoy the game. There's also no Freeride Extreme as far as I can tell, and you can't load directly to a portion of a chapter, you have to start chapters from the beginning if you replay them which is annoying cause the chapters are longer. Also, Definitive naturally carries over the generally slow and difficult beginning of the original game. Consider it a trial by fire to prove you're gangster enough to play the whole game.

Definitive recaptures the unique spirit that made people fall in love with Mafia back in 2002. The original isn't obsoleted, but only because of some of its unique quirks that didn't make it to Definitive edition. That being said, Mafia Definitive is still nothing less than worthy of the title ""Definitive Edition"".",1601163793,1601163793,TRUE,0,0,0.297619045,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,479,54,645,645,645,1601162482

11,Mafia Definitive Edition,76626496,english,"Rather dumbed down remake of the original game. The missions are started consecutively one after the other (unlike the previous game, where you had to manually start them after the first few), side missions are missing (no more stealing cars for Bertone), quite some cutscenes are changed to the point that their intention is pretty much reversed (e.g. Frank not trusting Tommy in the beginning). Some cutscenes were also toned down or references removed (e.g. Sarah), other parts of the missions were scrapped (e.g. take your shot friend to the doctor)

You are pushed through the missions in a rather linear way, unlike in the previous game, where you could explore the city between missions. 

While the city got somewhat bigger, you cannot ride trains or trams any more. In free roam, you can do even less than in the original game (where you could do little enough), no more gangsters driving around, just yourself getting police stars if you happen to run someone over.

And while the game says police react to running red traffic lights, I didn't encounter any. Traffic lights I mean.

The controls are mediocre. While driving and shooting is OK, close combat is hideous. Close combat is pressing the block button and then punch the s**t out of your enemy, then rinse and repeat. You can pick up weapons from the ground (but you have to get there first). You can take around 5 punches, however bullets seem to be less damaging. Despite having a ""run""-button I never managed to actually run (or in other words, running speed = walking speed). 

The only positive change I encountered is that the race got easier. Your racecar just doesn't take any damage any more, thus you can crash your foes out of the way all you like.

If you never played the original game, this might be a good choice for you, despite the story changes. If you were a fan of the original game and have high expectations in the remake, stay away, you will be disappointed by a lot of the smaller and bigger changes...",1601163020,1601163020,FALSE,2,0,0.500939429,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,521,27,176,176,176,1601160657
12,Mafia Definitive Edition,76562881,english,"Okay, this review will be INCREDIBLY long so I'll categorise everything to make it a little easier to digest. 

1)A BIT ABOUT ME:
I was actually born in 2002, so obviously didn't get to try the original out then. I got to about 11 or 12 years old and played the original then, having played Mafia 2 and also having ran out of games to play. I LOVED the original, it became my favourite. Mafia 3 my least favourite. I came into this remake with very low expectations since the same guys from Mafia 3 were developing it (with some help from the veterans of course). 

2)THE STORY:
In Mafia, you get into the shoes of cab driver Tommy Angelo, who bumped into two guys from the Salieri family. The game starts strong with a car chase and plenty of bullets. The two guys, when you drop them off having dropped the heat first, give money as compensation for what he'd done, from the Don himself. Tommy uses this money to repair his cab. He then gets suckered into the mob after getting bored of cabbying around, and after getting his cab smashed up by thugs from another family. Tommy is chased all the way down to Salieri's where the two people he met the other day helped scare off the thugs. He joined the mafia and started by trashing up the cars of the thugs that trashed his. The rest is history. 
You complete heists, assassinate politicians, blow up hotels, even compete in a RACE (More on that later) - - mission variety is fantastic here. Yes, the original game was like this and its based on that, but Hangar13 really did a good job even with filling in bits and pieces, like adding additional scenes and dialogue as well as further developing characters such as Tommy's love interest, Sarah, who gets a LOT more screen time than she did in the original. 

3)THE GAMEPLAY:
You can drive vehicles, engage in melee combat as well as using firearms, there's a cover system, the kinda thing you'd expect in a modern game. The game is made in the Mafia 3 engine, and uses a modified version of its shooting system-- it looked a bit too ""recycled"" on YouTube but you have to try it yourself; it's punchy, recoil is heavy, aiming is generally difficult (Tommy isn't a trained soldier, he's just a cab driver, so this is an amazing detail that helps convey this). Driving is probably the best it's been in the series-- a nice blend between the satisfaction of Mafia 3's, while not feeling too light or arcady, and the realism of the first two games. Cars have weight, and there's even a Manual Transmission option which I really recommend as it makes the driving that little more challenging. I also recommend turning on simulation driving to make steering that little bit more realistic and satisfying. Not to mention, motorbikes were added for the first time in the Mafia games... They handle nicely and are a nice new addition, they also look cool! 
Police will Ticket you for speeding or traffic violations, just like in the first two games, and arrest you for more major crimes. They don't shoot until you do, which is a nice detail. The police response can be toggled on or off. I recommend having it on. 
The game has four difficulty modes. Easy, Medium, Hard and Classic. I recommend classic, as it offers a real challenge that emulates the original game's difficulty. Enemies are lethal, you must make every bullet count, guns recoil much more heavily, reloading with ammo still in your clip will result in you losing that ammo, etc. It really is the way to play. You even get an achievement for it if that's your shtick! 
Melee combat is... Well, it exists, unlike mafia 3's instant takedown thing... You have an attack button (you can hold for a strong attack) and a dodge button. It's not button mashy, it's not anything too special but it gets the job done. Tommy cannot swim, and jumping into water will just teleport you back to shore. 

4)THE SOUND:
WOW this game sounds amazing. From the living, breathing streets of Lost Heaven, to the radio chatter that covers events going on in the city (and other cities from the series for that matter), and music (various tracks from the 30s). The same repetitive songs that used to play from the original are no more, which is something some people may be divided on.. Oh well. The radio also contains sports commentary, reports on real life events (like the prohibition, the war, the great depression etc). All a nice touch! 
The score is brilliant. Hangar 13 did an amazing job with music that gets intense with the gameplay, gets suspenseful with what's happening on screen, gets calm when the scene is calm... Its incredibly cinematic and I love it!
The voice actors from the original game were replaced. This is something I wasn't a fan of initially but they did grow on me-- the performances were absolutely amazing, from Tommy to Paulie, even Sam and Sarah grew on me! The voice actors did a smashing job here and this is all also aided by the state of the art performance capture that Hangar 13 used in this and Mafia 3 (say what you want about that game, but their facial animations were top notch). 

5)THE GRAPHICS:
This game looks beautiful. The buildings and architecture have a lot of detail, character models even more so, the roads and the vehicles too. Textures are generally really good looking, with the occasional muddy texture here and there. They are few and far between though and not too distracting. 
Reflections mostly look okay-- they work similarly to Mafia 3 in that the windows have Render-to-texture reflections, with screen space reflections over the top. They're a little blurry in spots but not too bad. The issue with these is that they flicker in and out from time to time. 
The global illumination looks good in most cases, but is also using some dynamic method rather than baked lightmaps... This does mean some weird artifacts when lighting loads in sometimes, just like Mafia 3, but not so apparent. 
The lighting looks good, from volumetric effects to the particles.. I'd say, like most things in the game, things are a good few steps up from mafia 3.

6)THE OPTIMISATION:
My PC isn't particularly high end anymore like it was 6 years ago. I could still run the game maxed out with 40-60fps. In other words, optimisation is pretty good! If my 6 year old rig can Max it out, I'm sure some slightly better specs than my i5 and gtx980 (non ti) can run the game flawlessly. Hangar 13 exceeded my expectations in this regard. 

WOW. I must say, I'm impressed. Hangar13, you've almost redeemed yourselves for that trainwreck that Mafia 3 was

7)ANY BUGS OR CRASHES?:
There have been a few bugs here and there, mostly visual with police cars floating and the like... The game did crash to the desktop 3 times in my entire playthrough though. Its NOWHERE near as bad as Mafia 3 was, and the game is definitely playable. These can definitely be patched out easily and quickly. Oh, and no 30fps patch this time! Hangar 13 have definitely learned and put a lot more effort in this time round.

8)THE CONTROLS:
The controls feel fluid. Tommy feels nice and smooth to move around and it all just feels a bit more polished. Tommy feels like... Well, Tommy! Not like Lincoln, not like Vito or anyone else. He is his own character and controlling him feels the same. 
Car controls are also brilliant. 

For the sake of comfort I do recommend rebinding a few driving controls. Here's my config:
CHANGE RADIO STATION -    ,  (Comma) 
TOGGLE RADIO -         .    (Period) 
CLUTCH (Manual transmission) - Left Shift
SHIFT UP (Manual) - Arrow Key Right
SHIFT DOWN (Manual) - Arrow Key Left
LEAN FWD (Motorcycle) - Arrow Key Up
LEAN BCK (Motorcycle) - Arrow Key Down

8) THE VERDICT:
If you're into Mafia, get this. If you like linear story driven games with a small element of free roam, get it. If you played the original from 2002 or even if you're new, give it a try! The original game is a masterpiece and this is too! Hangar 13 have redeemed themselves for the absolute clusterf@ck that was Mafia 3.

First I'm gonna talk about the Graphics, they are really good everything is this game is beautiful from the reflections to the textures, but the people faces though are really looks weird sometimes and most of their faces I have seen already in Mafia III

The gameplay is good it's remind of the atmosphere of Mafia II and It's a definitely a better version of Mafia III gameplay, I'm really glad it's not an open world anymore like GTA games, it's a story with a beautiful city to explore and there's an  option to Free mode (but sadly there's nothing to do after finishing the main story)
YOU CAN'T SWIM FOR SOME REASON!!!
the molotov and grenades throw it's the exact same from Mafia III, there's a lot of things in combat you might find they copy and paste it from Mafia III.
And last but not least there's actually some bugs and glitches!!
for example: while driving the car could fly and flip in the air after reaching the max speed and the fighting with hands when the enemy is close a wall the animation might glitch but after all the gameplay is alright, I wished though they worked harder on it to make it more realistic.

The story that we all know but better and I liked the new ending where Tommy accepted his faith and he wasn't surprise at all when Vito and Joe showed up and his last words between his family are so emotional and seeing Vito and Joe together again after all these years  It got me goosebumps.

For 40$ a whole remake of one of the best Mafia games I would see it's worth it, the story takes between 6 - 8 hours to finish but I was expecting more of this remake like new side missions and more to do after complete the story

For now, Mafia 1 Remake accomplishes everything what I wanted from the remake.
It has the climate of the original which is great.

On purpose I have set game mode to hard, car steering also on hard. I wanted to have original Mafia 1 experience.
I can forgive the bugs of the original and am very patient in matters like this, but...
for me, game is super unstable. On the beginning I had the black screen. Nvidia graphic's upgrade solved the problem.
Now, I get constant freezes. It's really pissing me off when I'm 2/16 on the second lap of the race and game randomly freezes without any error.

I will change my review if game will get some patch that fixes it. It's really annoying, and without this bugs/errors game looks great and I want to finish it :(

44,Mafia Definitive Edition,76623742,english,"Mafia, put briefly, is a straight linear gangster epic with a living world but without Open World filler, and this Definitive Edition truly a loving recreation of the original (if you were into the original game: Even the demon face in the mountain, home to the secret cave, makes a return). Everything that made the original great is still there - the story is still engaging (albeit of course rather clichéd), the characters interesting, the gunplay impactful and the driving... well, it's alright. Back in the day, Mafia was the first game to have characters with remotely lifelike faces (good enough for Paulie to be recognizable as basically Joe Pesci) and this remake lives up to that with great face capture performances that fit in well with an overall visually amazing world.

While the story and characters remain largely the same, the writing adds some depths to the core cast, while somewhat sidelining the secondary cast. The former is a welcome change, as some things like Tommy's family get a little more screen time and even the final lines of the game are given a bit more of an optimistic, conciliatory tone. Given the game's short playtime, I would however have loved more opportunities to get to know the secondary cast, some of which were actually present in the original game.

It's a short game, maybe 10-12 hours to complete, but it's an engaging ride. I suppose they could have padded out the experience with lots of open world shenanigans, but the way it is right now, it's a few hours of huge fun and gripping narrative.

But. I actually since playing the game, have noticed that the racing missions is less of a race and more of an 'on-rails section'. 

The cars aren't physically represented in-engine - they are on an a rail that artificially makes it so they are at a constant pace, cannot be knocked off course of swurved out or - easily passed by. I don't mind the idea that you can't just tackle a car to the sideline to cause it to crash, but it's so poorly balanced that cars are doing corners that if you attempted at the same speed would literally spend you flying into the trees outside of the level barriers. It's pure plastic restriction bullshit stuck right at the beginning of when the story actually gets good to force you to outplay the 'refund' timer.

61,Mafia Definitive Edition,76622296,english,"First of all, let me just come clean and tell you that I consider the original Mafia from 2002 to be one of the best video games ever. It's a game I've revisited many a time since, usually at Christmas. You know – family time. 

The graphics on the original was however quite dated, even by 2002's standards. For 18 years I wished someone would remake this game, and now we have it. The Definitive Edition remake is mostly a take by take recreation of the old game, with some additions to fill the gaps in both plot and character depth in the original game. 

But while the developers have given the game a much needed graphical makeover, the gameplay itself feels dated in the Definitive Edition. It's divided into a story mode and a free play mode, which seems unnatural after playing similar games in the years that have passed since 2002 – most notably the Grand Theft Auto series where you are free to roam and pursue the story missions when you feel like it, and where there's a rich, big world to explore in between missions. In Mafia's story mode, the world is mostly a backdrop on which the mise-en-scène plays out, and for younger players who are not familiar with the original game, this might seem out of place. You aren't free to drive that new car back to your garage after the mission has ended. A cut scene throws you right into the next mission or back into the interluding conversation with the detective in the coffee shop where the narrative plays out.

The narrative in Mafia would not really work if the game allowed the freedom we have become accustom to through games like Grand Theft Auto. After all, the basis of the whole story is a conversation between the protagonist and a detective, where the missions are episodes in this conversation. While this way of telling the story is what made the original so good in 2002, it holds the experience as a whole a bit back in 2020.

Along with the updated graphics, we have new models for the characters, including protagonist Tommy Angelo. As a fan of the original game, it took some time for me to get used to the new faces and voices, most notably those of Tommy and Paulie. They do grow on you as you play the game though. I was pleased to see developers have kept the original orchestral score, and re-recorded it to ensure it meets today's standards. I did however miss many of the classic jazz songs from the car radio in the original game. Songs that I listen to to this day, such as Django Reinhardt's ""gypsy jazz"" songs ""Minor Swing"" and ""Belleville"" and Lonnie Johnsons blues songs ""The Mooche"" and ""Jet Black Blues"".

I could go on forever, but I'll summarize: I am glad to see the game remade, and I think the developers have done an excellent job on it. It has some flaws in 2020, but it's still a great story, and I am glad younger players will experience the story that I have enjoyed so thoroughly for 18 years. If pressed between the original and the remake, I do however think I personally would prefer the original from 2002.

The story remains more or less the same, and it's just as great, if not better in some aspects. If you've never played the original due to outdated graphics/combat, now is your chance to experience the story in a modernized way. The cinematics are amazing, and everything looks fantastic. Some characters have more depth now (Sarah is actually likeable lol), the city looks great, the cars are fun. I hate driving in LA Noire, but I love it here. I didn't experience any game breaking bugs, only some visual glitches, mainly related to subtitles - a rarity in today's releases. I'm also happy with the game's price!

Even though I took my time doing all the story missions, some of them were over rather quickly. Maybe I expected more added content than the usual car chases. Though I don't mind them that much. Overall the story took about 12-13 hours to complete.
This might be just me, but there's one minor story change I didn't like - Michelle. In the original, [spoiler]Tommy calmly approaches her and decides to spare her life, because he personally thinks it'd be wrong to kill her. Then Sam mentions it in the art gallery as one of Tommy's mistakes.[/spoiler] In the remake, [spoiler]Sam begs him to spare her, Tommy approaches her in a very aggressive, threatening way, and it makes a lot less sense when Sam mentions it as Tommy’s mistake. So it was Sam who showed more humanity and compassion… but then throws it in Tom’s face…?[/spoiler]
Some of the dialogue changes also feel a little inferior to the original, but again, that might just be me.

Although the game runs beautifully on high settings, it’s freezing A LOT. It usually unfreezes itself after 10 or so seconds, but it’s really annoying.

Let me just say (at launch) Mafia 2 Definitive Edition was a hot heaping pile of shit. The graphics were better, especially for HD, but they also made some textures worse. Also there was audio bugs, radio stations not disappearing from your screen even while not inside of a car, cut scenes only having audio coming out of one earphone, ect.

Mafia 3 is just a shit game. I tried playing that again and it's not optimized at all on PC so just said fuck it.

So now to Mafia 1 remake. The story is good. The graphics are good. From what I understand they didn't really change the main story around too much, but that's the problem. The only thing in the game to do is play the main story. There are no side missions, shops, or nothing else that you can interact with. I think after you beat the first chapter, you unlock ""Free Drive"" mode. You literally just drive around, and shoot whatever gun you want to.

I'm sorry but this game by itself is not worth $40. The Trilogy should have only been $30 in total. I highly doubt they will go back and add more shit into the game.

This remake captures the same atmosphere as the original and is a great remake of the original story from a game/filmistic view point. Only for that, I recommend it. It's fun, nostalgic, a good (quick - rather old-fashioned) game on its own even if you didn't play the original. (And if you think the acting and animations are not up to standards... eh, they're at least better than in 2002.)

However, there are few downsides compared to the original:
- No Django Reinhardt (that I heard so far) in the sound track (understandable if copy right issues);
- No wheel support (driving on PC with the wheel is something is still plug and play in the 2002 version), which is a bummer for those really liking the realistic side of things. A good point here is that the realistic driving settings are still quite good for a non-car game and the gearbox can still be operated manually.
- The animations of pedestrians in particular repeat a lot. This is the most common example of where the game apparently cut some corners in the remake to speed up production. It's very atmospherical, but don't expect RDR2 level of detail (not that every game should reach that standard, but still, this one is noticable).

Things I liked

Things I didn't like
> Traffic AI & Traffic Laws are absolute garbage ( I hit a car point blank if front of the cops, they sussin me but, when I do a light tap on another civ car and still keep driving I get a ticket??)
> Lack of customization (No wep upgrades, no shops for nothing, can't even change clothes on whim)
>No dirty mags like the original (like wtf? why??)
> Last but not least. Keeping the Freeroam seperate ( I get that the original game came with ""freeride"" but reusing that again rather than going with the open world, makes finding collectables feel more like a chore than something you can have fun doing while you're doing a mission.)

As the game is rn, what I experienced still is a good game for old fans of the franchise and those who are new.

The gunplay isn't so hot, it's pretty rough and boring at times. There is also the racing mission in the game - which if you don't lower the difficulty for is almost impossible. The score is very weak, it often doesn't fit what is happening in the scene, at all. 

Overall it's ""just fine"" - nothing fantastic, but certainly worth the pickup if you are a Mafia fan.

Edit:
Having now finished the game, there is additional grievances: It took a very short amount of time to beat the game (7 hours) while the games price somewhat reflects that.

I didn't play the original, but the writing and gameplay is unimaginative and predictable.  The voice acting is terrible, most notably the WIDE range of utterly amateur accents, it's really jarring hearing a Canadian accent on a Chicago mob boss.

The race is well documented as game breakingly difficult, and rightly so because it is.  More over, in a game so story focused, it feels completely out of place.  They have to write in some story about the car, and then the dialogue goes through reason after reason until winning the race is the only option left.  Can't we just break his legs, in typical mafia style?  No that would be too obvious, but come race day, what happens to our driver?  oh...no...who could ever take his place now then?

Predictable, dull, and on a game where the story is the ONLY element, that makes for atrocious value.  There's no open world, GTA style, no character customisation, no money in your pocket, it's a very shallow game making you jump through some hoops between cutscenes.

This is a remake done completely from the ground up, and it is fantastic.
The graphics are gorgeous, I'd never thought I'd see the day where we'd see Lost Heaven rebuilt with modern visuals. The gameplay is ten steps above the original, even if I'm not all that big a fan of cover-shooters. The difficulty options were a welcome surprise and I regretted choosing classic mode once I got to the infamous race car chapter, though I managed to beat the game with it on. 

The story is a rework of the original, following the same beats but mixing it up a little in areas and fleshing out characters a lot more. I do miss the old voice actors, though the new ones do a pretty good job. Unfortunately some of the more memorable scenes from the original were screwed up, and I felt kind of disappointed in the ending in comparison to the original. The last cutscene for the final boss was changed completely and so was Tommy's epilogue speech. I understand that they felt the need to tie the theme in with the later games but I felt it just detracted from the experience.

Overall, it was a very enjoyable game and it offered really good value, especially if you've already played the original.

ill start with the bad.

-some small details were cut that were missed in this version.
-driving is odd to get used to (mafia on ice).
-minor graphical glitches ive noticed (mainly shadows).
-when moving the front wheels (steering) the front tires go see trough (not sure what thats about).
-pay attention to every scripted event regarding vehicles/planes it can be a bit silly and cartoony looking. 

there is not much more bad i can say. i could crack it down on every teeny tiny detail but honesly i enjoyed the game a lot. 
it did enough to make me remember everything. 

game ran pretty wel with every now and again noticing a small fps drop but nothing that would break immersion.

otherwise the game is fantastic it looks great and plays great! (once used to it).

i highly suggest you try the game out. unless you really dislike these kind of games but if you are someone who is sceptical seeing what maffia 3 was or how the other definitive editions came out. this one is great! 
ofcourse not perfect but fun to play regardless!

29,Mafia Definitive Edition,76615463,english,"A great attempt at a remake of an absolutely outstanding game. 

When I saw the first few trailers and heard the new voice actor for Tommy I cringed, and became a little worried that they'd butchered some of the characters. I wasn't wrong - some feel the same/similar, others are completely different.

Tommy himself doesn't act anything like the Tommy from the original game. Paulie was absolutely butchered by the modeling team, Sam is just a lifeless goon until he's needed, and Don Salieri looks like he's 10 years younger and acts nothing like his original self.

Playing in classic mode was entertaining and overall I enjoyed the game, despite the glaring flaws with some of the creative liberties taken by the writers/developers. 

It's very clear the game is running on the Mafia 3 engine - the launcher is a giveaway by itself - and this is a travesty as it completely removes the original gunplay and extreme attention to detail within the game world and the way the player interacts with it. And good lord, don't even get me started on the stealth mechanics that shouldn't even exist.

Also, what happened to the music? I was so disappointed when the radio turned on and none of the original music was there, and this applies to all areas of the game, including the Main Menu of the game itself. They should have kept the original score, it's beautiful.

This feels like some kind of Netflix reboot of a series that ended up getting 50% on RT. 

I'm still leaving a positive review since I enjoyed playing it, but it left a slightly sour taste in my mouth due to so many unnecessary and often obnoxious changes.

To me MAFIA (2002 Original) is probably one of the best games ever made. This remake, while visually stunning, is not on par to the level of immersion the original game provided.

The difficulty here feels artificial, the enemies are constantly hit scanning and sometimes it gave me the impression that the hit boxes of the cover system were a little off. 
The driving is very solid and even included manual transmission but sometimes it also suffers from the artificial difficulty settings (particularly during the race scene as the other cars rubberband to keep you “challenged” or during police chases with roadblocks and patrols spawning a little too close to you sometimes).
The gunplay is average as well, chest-high walls cover shooting. The original felt more organic as it gave you the ability to crouch behind cover and the enemies were less prone to hitscan you.
The story is actually very close to the original (there are some changes but I don’t think the writers did a bad job), the animations, character textures and voice acting are amazing. However, from the game design perspective the immersion is broken just to have flashy set piece battles, there is literally a scene where you take out an armored vehicle (pretty much a tank) with a tommy gun.

In resume this remake is the streamlined dumbed down version of MAFIA. It looks good, sounds good but doesn’t play as good as the original.

I was a massive fan of Mafia when it first debuted on PC 18 years ago. I was such a big fan in fact that I opened and ran the largest modding site for the game at the time, MafiaMods.com. You can imagine then my excitement when I heard Mafia was going to be completely remade.

When I first got my hands on it 2 days ago I was having a blast reliving old memories in my old favorite city, made over in a gorgeous new paint job. The new driving physics are also phenomenal. Some of the best I've ever experienced in an open world game. The new voiceover acting is also quite good. Maybe not quite on par with a game like RDR2, but certainly close enough to be believable.

The problems come the more you play. The more you play the more you realize not only did they remove some of the gameplay from the main story that made the original great, but there still is literally nothing to do in this gorgeous open world aside from shooting at cops and running people over. There is no currency. Nothing to buy. No gameplay loops and no real consequences for your actions. There's no photo mode or any way to remove the HUD.

49,Mafia Definitive Edition,76615640,english,"Great game, never played the original or any of the Mafia series so I didn't know what I was getting into but was a fantastic story. The graphics are great and really add to the game being so polished. Finished the whole story in about 10.5 hours of straight playthrough (no free roaming).

Firstly, It was great to see a PC game have so few bugs out of release. Through the whole story I only came across one annoying bug where I vaulted over a window and I got insta-killed for no reason, but apart from that it was very polished. You could tell the devs were very passionate about this game.

Pros:
- Gripping story! Don't read up online too much about it otherwise you'll spoil it for yourself!
- Driving the cars was excellent, handled just like you'd expect and made driving round the city a joy.
- Great voice acting and character models made the game feel a lot more polished and alive. I only noticed a couple situations where the eyes on the character models went a bit crazy.
- The city feels very alive, i can't quite put my finger on why but it feels like it actually has a soul, rather than some mindless and futile space filler.


Cons:
- There isn't any down time between missions, you'll have to quit to the main menu and go to ""free roam"" to explore the city. I understand this isn't exactly GTA5 and while i usually prefer a quick succession of missions, during the latter half of the game it felt a bit overwhelming finishing one long and action packed mission and then being thrown straight into another. Maybe an option to exit to free roam between mission would be a good addition or even just an option to quit to the main menu before starting a new mission.
- Sometimes the enemies didn't react/flinch a whole lot when you shot them, which meant that you could be peppering a guy with 4-5 bullets and they may still shoot at you which is a bit unrealistic. Having said that, this didn't always happen so perhaps just needs a patch.
- Guns got a bit boring after a while and I just picked up whatever was on the floor rather than being selective about what guns i picked and developing a preference.

The graphics are on par with Mafia 3 but there are some animations from Mafia 3 that Hanger 13 didn't use for some reason, for instance when changing from a rifle to a pistol Lincoln Clay just takes the pistol out and holds it with his right hand while still holding his rifle with his left, while in this game Thomas Angelo puts his rifle into the black hole that is his suit pocket and pulls out a pistol which feels very last gen.

59,Mafia Definitive Edition,76615273,english,"Story
• I love it. It's simple, effective, beautiful and I'd consider it on par with the movies The Godfather I and II and The Irishman. Kind of below my favorite Goodfellas but definitely better than The Wolf of Wallstreet. The Wolf of Wallstreet jumbled its messaging where Goodfellas, Godfather series, The Irishman and Mafia game succeeded in telling you being in the mafia is horrific, shocking and regretful, Wolf made you think being a criminal is fun, edgy and exciting. Mafia's story is an action drama that set out to tell one thing and it did in tragic flying colors.
• crime dramas should feel like a punch in the teeth, not like The Wolf Of Wallstreet where being a criminal is like Project X.
Graphics
• quality is like what Capcom did remaking Resident Evil 2. It's excellent.
• City of Lost Heaven is beautiful and wonderful to roam around in.
Sound
• High quality voice acting with distinct mafioso and 1920s america accents.
• classic old timey music sounded like what your great grandfather's radio would sound like with 1920s radio filter.
Gameplay
• Bog standard shooting but the popping of heads is satisfying. There are shotguns and tommy guns but I used handguns 95% of the time. AI can be dumb, they cant shoot for shit but they aim their molotovs way too accurately. Be warned.
• driving 1920s cars is uh... what you'd imagine. The tires feel like they're horse chariots, the acceleration is slow and the speed is what my mom would consider safe and slow, but when you get used to it, it's incredible and immersive.
• The walking and running feels like GTA V.
• You can choose difficulty settings on the combat, driving and how the cops respond if you speed or go through stop signs.
• It looks like an open world game, sounds like an open world game and drives like an open world game but it's a very linear game. There's no free roaming between missions and the story continues from one bit to the next.
• Finished it in less than 10 hrs without collectathons.
• Experienced bugs here and there but nothing immersion- or game-breaking.",1601148139,1601148139,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,79,18,1302,1302,1302,1601143781

The original czech voice actors are back and the waves of nostalgia i got from the intro were overwhelming. The missions were superb with added cutscenes and voice lines which immersed me into the story more than i thought was possible. The classic difficulty setting is really for those who played the original and aren't afraid to use their ammo wisely. The free ride mode with a nice homage to free ride extreme missions and cars are going to make me play this game for a long time. 

Now there are some little tid bits which i didn't like. Some missions and their features were cut short. For example Moonlighting with the yellow Pete segment and Sarah with its adult scene and overall the missions were ""shorter"" than the original. That's really all i can say about this amazing game!

As a kid one of the first games that got me hooked on stories in games was Mafia 2, then I went back and ofcourse forward to the other games. For me, Mafia 2 still takes the cake but this one is darn good.

One of my ONLY things that makes me sad is that I just wished there was more content, ATLEAST to what Mafia 2 provided, stores to rob, changing outfits mid-story, etc. It just kinda seemed too linear.

BUT they supplement it with a free roam mode AFTER the game (or after chapter 1 if you really wanna get into it) where you can chase down collectibles etc.

Also, where the hell is the winter in Chicago? They should have thought of some way to nod at Mafia 2's coming home for Christmas scene. MOST ICONIC scene.

Anyway, I hope and pray they remake Mafia 2 and add in all of the cut content. OR they continue Joe's story and have the game continue until he's in New Bourdeaux. Wonderful game, very happy with the cost.

 - The Game is stunning! A delight to play.
 - Car Physics are on point, as well as the bikes. I recommend using simulation for some real immersion!
 - Radio Stations are cool
 - The Story (of course)
 - Level Design
 - Easy to Run, locked 60fps at Max Settings on an RTX 2070 (Big ups to the devs for that one

Cons:
 - Compared to modern games, a very short story!
 - Nothing but the story, literally, that's it. No side missions, objectives, other things to do.
 - Empty World, I thought there would be more stuff going on, things to do, places to visit. If free roam, Any area that you can go inside in the story is locked off, including the race track, BOOOOOOO!!!!!!

[i] Перед тем как начать обзор, хочу сказать о том, что у меня нет синдрома утёнка, как минимум по отношению к первой оригинальной мафии. [spoiler]С серией я познакомился в таком порядке 2-> 3-> 1 оригинал-> 1 DE. [/spoiler] Также игру до конца я ещё не прошёл, но то что уже увидел впечатлило.

 Внимание, сюжет игры изменён, но основные ключевые события сохранены. Римейк имеет на это право. Изменения на самом деле прикольные, персонажей сделали более человечными, расширили диалоги, характеры. Та же Сара, жена главного героя, в оригинале появлялась всего пару раз в кат сценах, а разговаривала с Томми всего в одной миссии где он спасал её от хулиганов, а после у них был шрекс. В римейке же она не давалка из прошмандовок азербайджана, а итальянская девушка со своим характером. Диалоги с Полли и Сэмом так же были расширены, но не буду вникать в спойлеро/подробности. Кстати, миссия с гонкой выполнена на достойном уровне, возможно, даже сложнее оригинала, а ещё в разговоре с Ральфи после победы есть забавная пасхалка, думаю вам понравится.

 Лост-Хевен был построен с нуля с красивой современной графикой. Как же круто они построили декорации для этой игры, вот правда. Кататься ночью под проливным дождём на центральном острове под светом неоновых вывесок одно удовольствие. Или новый Чайна-Таун, где висят красные китайские фонари. Если вы знали город в оригинале, то сможете спокойно ориентироваться в нём и в римейке, т. к. основная структура города и его архитектура были бережно сохранены. Если подводить итоги, то один из главных героев в лице города сохранён и заодно улучшен.

 Теперь плавно или не очень переведу тему на рассказ о геймплее, но сначала упомяну, что новые кат сцены сняты на уровне, но это было вполне ожидаемо, так как в мафии 3 с этим проблем не было. Прохожу игру на ""классической"" сложности и симулятивном режиме вождения. Игра конечно не совсем классическая, так как тут не деревянная боёвка из оригинала, которую вырезали из прошлой игры Illusion Softworks, а вполне неплохая стрельба из третьей части. Также хочется отменить, что игра стала более ""Голливудской"" или что-то типа того. Ураганных перестрелок стало намного больше и к тому же в игре появились красные бочки на миссиях с перестрелками, взрывы от которых могут активировать скрипт и сломать что-то или эффектно бабахнуть. В общем шутерная механика делает своё дело и работает вполне приемлемо. Ощущения от вождения отличаются от оригинала, тем не менее вышло неплохо. На карте теперь появились скриптовые места, чтобы можно было сбросить преследователей, а-ля какой-нибудь NFS: MW 2005. Остались дрифтовые входы в поворот из третьей части серии, но сама физика вождения сильно отличается от неё. Она стала намного лучше, медленные машины ездят как им и подобается, но сама динамика выросла в этом плане по сравнению с оригиналом. ИИ пешеходов стал умнее по сравнению с прошлой игрой студии Hangar 13. Теперь никто не бросается под колёса главного героя словно мечтая умереть от его рук.У игры ужасный перевод на русский язык. Судил сугубо по субтитрам, так как играю с оригинальной озвучкой.

 Вроде бы сказал о всём, что хотел поведать об игре. На выходе получился хороший гангстерский боевик за неполный прайс. К покупке рекомендую это одна из лучших игр этого необычного 2020 года.

Советы перед тем как начать играть:

Играть обязательно на ""классической"" сложности с режимом вождения ""симулятор""
Играть на оригинальном английском языке
Если у вас есть геймпад, то советую управлять машинами и ходить на нём, так как в игре круто реализована вибрация, да и в целом управлять приятнее машинами.
Если у вас монитор с частотой развёртки свыше 60Гц, то советую найти видео на ютубе или руководство в сообществе как поправить это.
Если у вас карточка от зелёных, то вот моё руководство для того, чтобы сделать картинку сочнее и чётче. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2239768954",1601126123,1601144730,TRUE,11,2,0.535384417,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,1167,28,1699,1699,784,1601732918

1,Mafia Definitive Edition,76612121,english,"This game is a remake of Mafia 1 (best in series) so its worth playing, even for a story. However im not sure is it worth buying now. 
Its quite expensive for what it is (10h long single player game with no real replay value), and it has some issues. Small bugs (like disappearing textures) are annoying but not game breaking, however there are more serious problems, like 30s or longer freezings when entering menu, or freezing after cutscenes. Game starts fine, but after some time playing it becomes less stable and more prone to these problems. Memory leak?
I noticed my computer is being very hot (i didnt measure temp but i can fell heat like from heater), so this game is probably processor or graphic card heavy. Maybe its too hot hence hickups and freezes? I dont know, but its really bad.
Game looks really good and modern, which is a plus, city is really beautiful. However gameplay is quite archaic and not very entertaining. Controls are clunky, recoil is heavy, lack of ammo- it makes this game to appear harder than it is. Driving is atrocious and other cars/pedestrians just annoy you to no end, as they blindly ram you or block you causing accidents. Which is double annoying on missions where you have to caught someone or escape. Combat is also clunky, and stealth i just want to forget. Never again. At least checkpoints are plentiful and you dont have to repeat these infuriating fragments from scratch.
Im a gameplay man, for me gameplay is most important part of game. In this game i didnt enjoy it at all, i played for story, which is very good btw. So yea, if not story i would rate it very low.
Its worth playing, but dont have many expectations about gameplay. Its old and it seems.
I cant recommend this game today, for that price and with all these flaws. Wait for a sale and for fixing all of these technical issues.",1601144590,1601144590,FALSE,1,0,0.459056526,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,295,3,628,628,628,1601141304

3,Mafia Definitive Edition,76611974,english,"+ Great story, faithful to the original. Some of the plotlines and characters were altered, but mostly for good. Overall, there slightly more substance to the foundation of the original, events are more interconnected, characters have traits, more dialogue, but all iconic lines and cutscenes are present.
+ Fabulous design of costumes, cars and locations, pretty good enviromental storytelling.
+ Many hisorical details.
+ Nice stealth mechanics with several missions to employ them.
+ Good graphics.

- Pacing problems: the last half of the game consists of repetitive shoot-outs without virtually no other gameplay to dilute it, whereas the original had more drive and preparing sections between them. No Lucas Bertone missions as they were in original to separate plot-heavy episodes.
- Unsatisfying gun combat, full of covers, randomness and missing shots. Sometimes player even doesn't realise where shooting enemy is located.
- Cannot carry more than two guns, and ammo is very limited. On a weapon wheel there are two separate slots for grenades and molotovs, whereas never both are found on a single mission - but only two slots for guns.
- No progression in gun power through the story: every handgun feels the same, rifles and tommies are present even in early missions.
- Clunky AI. NPCs are often trying to shoot through the wall.
- Slightly less cars than in the original. Without Bertone missions and Ralph's introductions there is no feel of car progression. In many missions, in which the original allowed you to pick a car, this game bounds you to use a specific one.
- Abysmal melee combat. Each melee weapon has literally ONE animation, both for light and heavy attacks. Your hits can magically miss, but when an NPC is making an attack, you have to smash ""dodge"" button, because you cannot run out of his reach or try to interrupt his attack, as long as an NPC started his animation. In one particular fight I spent 20 minutes trying to knock out a guy just to realise that you MUST make a heavy attack in order to finish him (and there was no indication of it).
- Sometimes there are clunky facial animations.
- THE RACING MISSION. The worst game design ever on classic difficulty, a piece of cake on easy. Can't believe that minimum of three people were given money for designing and placing little metal obstacles, which have only purpose of flipping your car over.

Pros:
+Gunplay feels like a mix of Mafia 2 & 3
+Driving feels realistic to the time period
+Story is incredible so far, no stale or boring cut-scenes as in Mafia 3
+Voice acting is SPOT on and I love the way each character has a unique personality in the way they talk
+THE SOUND is insane, in one of the first few missions when saving Sam from the barn type house, the voices from other rooms throughout the house almost sound like there was someone in my house talking in another room, it was crazy how immersive it was and I've never experienced that in a game before.

Characters movement and response is really bad. The characters does not respond to you in a crisp and predictable manner.  Its fine when you are leisurely walking, but when the action breaks out, you start to see how bad the controls are. Maybe there is a learning curve and you can adapt to the responsiveness of the controls, but its 2020, character control in game is not a new concept and should not require a learning curve to be able to smoothly get you character into the position you need him to be in.  
Vehicles on the other hand, seem to drive really well and are enjoyable.  I'm drying on realistic setting and its good to see tires break traction and understeer when heavy breaking.  Cars show their weight well too.

The animations and acting are fantastic, and the addition of cover mechanics and being able to actually aim where you're shooting at is a welcome change from the original where gunfights would be clumsily standing in full view without any cover and hoping you can kill the bad guys before your health runs out and still have enough to do the same at the next set of baddies.

The driving is decent even on regular mode, and comes pretty close to the original on simulation.

45,Mafia Definitive Edition,76607444,english,"Well. I've just finished the game after a little under 9 hours. 

I haven't touched this game since... well shit.. maybe 2005? It's been a hot minute. The Mafia series (excluding 3) are some of my favorite games. Going back into Mafia 1 was a blast. I had goosebumps from the first mission, reliving a little bit of my childhood. But that's all that I could remember from the original! It was like playing a whole new game again, which was pretty neat. 

The game is beautiful. I am still having a little bit of an odd visual stutter while driving and moving my camera at the same time, but I ended up just not moving my camera anymore..

The story of the game was fantastic, however... Disappointingly short. Maybe I just rushed through the game faster than I should've, but I feel as though I went through it at a relatively normal pace. I was running through the missions trying to find all the collectables I could, and searching for every molotov I could find, or interesting interaction with an NPC. 

Again, I don't remember much from the original game, but from what I do remember this is a wonderful Remaster/Remake. 

My only disappointment is how fast I went through the game. Now that I've completed it, I feel as though there is nothing else to do, but play it again on a higher difficulty?

i have played mafia 1 and 2 for years, replaying both games multiple times including the bonus content like freeride extreme and mafia 2s dlcs, i would consider the original 2 games to be some of my personal favorites

pros:



the radio is music is great

the car sounds and handling are well done

some areas are very well detailed

the freeride mode includes secret car unlocks at bertones, which you can also use in the story mode, and has endgame content in the form of 3 extra challanges at salieris bar

cons:

the voice acting is bad, the voices dont fit the original characters and the story itself at all, to the point where the characters dont even feel like the same people as in the first game, the characters act way too unproffessional for their enviroment and are generally very annoying

the missions are NOTHING alike the original game, most missions are very simplified and linear, allowing basically no freedom whatsoever, the only missions bearing resemblance to the originals are the ones seen in youtube pre release videos and review copies (thats ofc to bait the original fans)

every lucas bertone side mission has been REMOVED, bertone now only has 5 ""clues"" towards special cars, none of his jobs from the original game are included, making some cars UNOBTAINABLE

car unlock system makes no sense and makes cars unobtainable, in the original game you would get many unique cars in bertones side missions, which would later spawn in traffic, the order goes as follows: ulver airstream, thor 810, silver fletcher (originally unlocked in visiting rich people), bruno speedster 851, celeste marque 500, lassiter V16 appolyon, trautenberg model j, thor 812
in definitive edition, lucas bertones side missions are REMOVED, which means you CANNOT OBTAIN MOST OF THESE CARS. the speedster 851 is ENTIRELY REMOVED, the celeste is UNOBTAINABLE (same goes to a newly added sports car), and the silver fletcher is UNOBTAINABLE IN THE MAIN STORY and only unlocks after completing the game.
the original games unlock system had ralphie or bertone showing you how to unlock cars, making you able to steal them, this is entirely cut and replaced by a generic gta-esque smash and grab mechanic.
the original games traffic system gave you a sense of time progression, you would not see many different cars during 1932, but by 1936 you see newer cars, making the early 30s cars rare. this system is entirely cut in de and you see the same cars throughout the whole game, the only change being that freeride gets updated traffic after you complete the story.
this also means you are forced to use the same cars for most of the game, and you only unlock the ulver airstream (now named culver airmaster) in the 3rd to last mission in the game, and you only unlock the cord 812 during the final mission in the game, with the 810 being entirely absent.
nearly all of the late 30s traffic models are also removed from the game entirely.

freeride extreme is entirely removed, only thing remaining is 2 really lame post game time trials that give you 2 of the original freeride extreme cars, the crazy horse and the mutagen
while crazy horse is mostly the same, the mutagen is entirely redesigned and lost all of its charm it had in the original, the mutagen used to be a highly modified cord 810 with a very unique engine sound, in the definitive edition the mutagen is a rusted out jalopy with no resemblance to the original whatsoever.

my biggest issues with the game:

the on foot controls feel janky and unnatural, the game basically expects you to just spam the cover button for every mission, resulting in boring and increadibly lazy combat scenarios.

the combat is horrible, in my personal opinion this game has the worst combat out of any 3d open world game i have played, the melee is just a spam of the attack button and an increadibly glitchy dodge mechanic that most of the time makes you phase through your enemy, and the guns feel increadibly weak, the gun sounds are terrible and the general gunplay feels more like youre using a pea shooter than a real gun.

the police system makes entirely no sense, pedestrians will magically call the police to inform them of anything you do without any pay phone in their general area, how do they have mobile phones in the 1930s?
you also magically hear cop chatter at all times, maybe tommy is a psychic in this game, i dont know

the game is increadily non-immersive, you have invasive destination markers all over your screen at all time, and see button prompts on every single thing you can interact with, even with classic mode on, this gets increadibly annoying and neither mafia 1 or 2 had any of this, it honestly ruins any kind of immersion the game has in the first place.

the story has been redone and lost its original meaning, mafia 1 had a strong story with meaningful messeges throughout, definitive edition removes all of that and replaces it with a generic ""family is important"" messege that sounds like something youd hear in a fast and furious movie, the characters arent close to their original counterparts and the whole ending is entirely ruined, with very important details changed for no reason at all.

the ability to do missions in a few ways, and the general lack of linearity (especially in such a linear game by purpose) was what made mafia 1 so special, which the remake completely negates by straightup removing most approaches (like the choice of going stealth or loud) and also leading the player literally everywhere, the boat mission gets so increadibly linear you will get a prompt saying ""return to mission area"" for trying to take a different angle to shoot your target at, this is generally a theme throughout the game, you have to go a speciffic path and beat missions exaclty the way the game tells you to or you will instantly fail, another great example of this is the mission where you chase sergio to the docks on a motorcycle, on my playthrough his ai glitched out and got his car stuck, i left the bike and tried to shoot him and the game failed me for ""losing sergio""

the game also teases you with choice for the preview build missions, like paulie asking you to take him to blue tropics after the racing mission, which had no markers and generally felt like a very neat detail, but of course this or anything similar never happens again, it just shows the potential the devs had to make the game more immersive and open instead of the painfully linear experience it currently is.

 the composed score for the game is well done, but it plays during pretty much every single cinematic or action sequence, even a cutscene of 2 characters sitting in a park casually, which completely changes the meaning of these scenes and makes them artificially cinematic and movie-like, they also reuse the exact same theme song for every mission in the game, which gets increadibly annoying, even the original mafia had more varied mission music, only mission that had its own unique theme was the racing mission.

the mentioned ""character expansions"" for sarah are painfully bad, there is an entire cutscene that literally goes: ""marry me"" ""okay""

on a technical standpoint, the game is a complete mess, its filled with glitches and generally runs terribly, its a widely known issue that the framerate is inconsistant and the graphics are overall increadibly glitchy.

overall this game is painfully linear, increadibly un-immersive and is missing key elements that made the original mafia such a fantastic game, it completely misses the point of what mafia is meant to be as a series and instead gives you a bad linear experience with little to no replayability or choice, you can really tell that hangar 13 has no idea why the original 2 games are so beloved, and honestly i doubt they even played the original before making this """"""""definitive"""""""" edition",1601138400,1601138866,FALSE,29,2,0.691969097,7,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,167,21,683,683,683,1601078272

76,Mafia Definitive Edition,76586995,english,"Mafia: Definitive Edition is a lazy overpriced remake. The visual upgrade is all smoke and mirrors.

I've played 2 hours on ""Classic mode"" (Simulation driving), which is also the hardest mode and the closest thing to the original Mafia experience. Unfortunately that wasn't enough. This is a soulless remake.

The story is probably the biggest issue. Not faithful to the original. They changed many characters lines, motivations and relationships, so you're basically looking at a different story with barely any emotion. As an example, in the original one Tommy was a regular cab driver who didn't want to join the Family but was forced to. In the remake Tommy asks to join the Family to get revenge. They also removed some story parts, that's why the game lasts around 8-10 hours, much less than the original one. The famous racing mission is still there though and it's still insanely hard.

NPCs and main characters all look generic, maybe cause there's a complete lack of facial animations. You're often looking at blank faces, even during cutscenes. When you're throwing a molotov it looks like you're throwing a ball, you can even throw it easily behind you. When fighting Tommy animations look like Lincoln Clay ones. He's just a cab driver, but moves and kills like a brutal soldier and apparently he's able to drive and honk with no animation.

Melee combat is awful and really confusing on interiors 'cause of the stupid camera getting really close. You will often end up with your beated enemy standing in a awkward position (terrible ragdoll physics). Gunplay is somewhat okay. Driving on simulation mode is good, but shooting from a car is a nightmare. Cars damage is not realistic and not even enough. Overall the gameplay doesn't feel fun or satisfying.

Graphics are good. The city is really beautiful and I loved the countryside being connected. Unfortunately this version of Lost Heaven feels dead with zero interactivity and a terrible AI (cars suddenly crashing into things). There are many bugs and glitches that you would expect from the creators of Mafia III: pop-in, textures suddenly missing, floating weapons, NPCs getting stuck on the walls and so on. Reflections are beautiful at night, but during the day they look wrong and exaggerated.

Edit: This is my conclusion after I finished the main story:
(ofc free of spoiler)

[h1]Graphics:[/h1]
Sure, Mafia Definitive Edition is based on the Mafia 3 Engine but it looks great. The cars are beatiful and handle pretty decent. The faces of all characters are well designed und the reworked city looks incredible. If you played Mafia 1, nostalgia will hit you straight into your face with a baseball bat.

[h1]Gameplay: [/h1]
It is a story driven, linear game. You can love or hate it. My criticism is, that it would have been better, if you had some kind of open world like Mafia 3 had, where you had markings for a quest. Additionally it would have been fun to start a new day at your home and drive to a specific location for a specific quest. But all in all it is still fun.

[h1]Sound:[/h1]
If you played the original Mafia 1 you will desperately miss the old soundtrack. Don´t get me wrong, the new one is far from bad, but I personally miss the tracks from Django Reinhardt etc. The new tracks are well chosen and fit in that timeline.
The sound of cars and guns are pretty good too.

[h1]Story:[/h1]
Just as I said in the beginning, if you loved Mafia 1, this will be a pure path of nostalgia.
If you did not, be prepared for a compelling story.

I fell in love with the original Mafia for being realistic and immersive. It was everything Grand Theft Auto wasn't. It was subtle, believable, and HARD. Driving was hard, but rewarding. Shooting was hard, but rewarding. I loved that.

This is EVERYTHING the original Mafia was, but better. I'm still playing through (on Classic difficulty, with Simulation driving) and it's been a blast. It's just *slightly* different to be refreshing yet not so much that it changes any major plot points or missions. It's a worthy replacement of the original.

Oh, and Fair Play. That racing mission. It was JUST as head-bashingly hard as it was originally (on Classic difficulty anyway) and I loved that. This game doesn't hold your hand. It throws you into a 1932 Grand Prix and says ""Win it."" I wasn't even sure if I could beat it at all in the first 6 attempts, until I learned to master my racing line and braking.

As a side note; I got the game pre-ordered, so I got the V12 FWD car. It's amazingly fun as well, being reasonably quick and nimble with a low center of mass; and being the only FWD in the game so far (the cars change as the years pass) it actually feels pretty unique to drive.

I haven't played the first one so I can only compare from watching somebody else play the original. The game is a lot of fun - very intuitive and easy to handle. Killing feels rewarding. If you have a destination it starts showing an arrow with a direction of where you are headed so you never lose track of where you have to go without looking at the map. This doesn't sound like a big deal, but considering I haven't seen this implemented in a non-disturbing way into any HUD in other games I think it's worth mentioning. Sometimes walking slowly can be a bit of an annoyance, but it kind of adds to the mafia flavour and the city's 30s vibes and it's theme. Also a big plus for me: you CAN skip cinematics - though I actually advise watching them, because they're worth watching so far.

2,Mafia Definitive Edition,76598573,english,"Tak jsme se konečně dočkali. Po 18 dlouhých letech se chlapíci ze třináctýho Hangaru rozhodli, že Vávrovi překopou scénář a udělají remake původní verze od Illusion Softworks. Povedlo se to?

Odpověď na tuto otázku je dost diskutabilní. Myslím si, že hodnocení Remaku bude jako měření pindíků  mezi npř. iOS x Android, Ronaldo x Messi, XBOX x PS,... Protože podle mého názoru se zde střetnou dva názory: 

 1. názor zatvrzelých starých boomerů, kteří původní hru prošli nespočetněkrát a trvají na tom, že původní hra je klenot a jakákoliv obměna prostě a jednoduše nepřichází v úvahu. 

2. názor mladší skupiny lidí, která je otevřena potencionálním změnám. Tahle skupina bude naopak nadšena z toho, že si mohou zahrát starou klasiku v novém grafickém kabátku, s jiným gameplayem a scénářem.

A ke které skupině se přikláním já? V tomhle měření pindíků zaujmu postoj neutrální. Nepřikloním se ani k jedné straně.  

Z počátku jsem se obával. Obával jsem se z toho, že nejslavnější a nejpovedenější mafiánská hra, ještě k tomu Česká, bude průser. Všichni víme, co to bylo za fiasko, když vyšla Mafie III. A ještě před vydáním Remaku jedničky bylo zcela jasné, že na něm bude pracovat to stejné studio... 
Situaci nezlepšil ani remaster původní, a za mě druhé nejlepší mafiánské hry, Mafia II. Díky tomuhle skvělému remasteru jsme nezaznamenali témeř žádné grafické ani jiné vizuální změny hry. Bohudík, že nám to dali zadarmo...

Avšak přátelé průser to nebyl! Remake bych definoval výrazem ""NOT BAD"", protože to fakt nebylo špatný, bohužel to nebyl ani žádný masterpiece. 

Remake přetváří původní hru do nového a velmi atraktivního kabátku, díky kterému se při hraní budete oblizovat, protože hra vypadá opravdu úžasně. Celkovou plynulost pak výrazně zrychluje tempo a momentum hry. Vše se děje v hodně rychlém časovém sledu. Hra má dokonce i rozšířený epilog, nachází se tam i Tomova smrt, když přijede Joey a Vitto. Bohužel musíte se smířit s několika ne zcela žádnoucíma věcma. Téměř celý model pohybu pochází ze třetí Mafie. Střelba, schovávání se překázky, skákání přes překázky, tichá asasinace ze zadu nebo dokonce i ""autoaim"" při střelbě za jízdy. Pokud překonáte to, že vaše oblíbená hra, využívá věci z vaší pravděpodobně nejneoblíbenější hry, tak jste za vodou a užijete si krásných 10 hodin Remaku kvalitní hry. 

Pak je tu ještě několik vad, které škodí téhle hře. Nejsem si zcela jist, jestli si jich všimne každý nebo jenom já, ale napíšu je sem.
- Hra má kromě nového dabingu i jiný soundtrack, který mi prostě nesedí. Když jdete zabít Morela, hraje tam Ave Maria, kterou je možné slyšet třeba na konci Hitman: Blood Money v misi Requiem. A po klasickém soundtrack s názvem ""Little Italy"" od Djanga Reinhardta se prostě a jednoduše každému zasteskne. 
- Lip sync neboli prostě to jak hýbou hubou, když mluví, taky nesedí. Lip sync je dělaný na angličitnu, takže se k tomu český dabing vůbec nehodí. 
- Hra má trochu krkolomné ovládání a chvíli to trvá, než si na to člověk zvykne. Samotné míření je dost divné, crouch pomocí ""X"", pěstní souboje, kdy uhýbáte pomocí levého altu a direktujete pomocí Q a přitom to tam na vás svítí jako vánoční stromeček.
- Samotný scénář... Bohužel scénář prostě nebyl tak dobrý. Ze začátku jsem se šíleně tlachal, zvlášť u pasáže, kdy Ralph zahlásil ""Teď tu máme dva kriply."" Ke konci a hlavně na samotném konci je dle mého názoru scénář uplně mimo. Nezazněla ani legendární hláška ""Přátelství je sračka.""
- Bugy. Ano bugy měla i původní hra, ale za mě by její Remake, který je o 18 let starší mohl tenhle nepříjemný prvek nějak pořešit. Parkrát se mi povedlo se zabít jen díky tomu, že jsem přeskočil přes překážku nebo jsem se nějakým záhadným způsobem ocitl v textuře a umřel.
- CHYBĚLA SCÉNKA SE SÁROU!

Možná nejsem tak uplně neutrální a přikláním se trochu ke skupině boomerů a moc srovnávám remake s původní hrou, a díky tomu hledám nedostatky.

The world of this game is dripping in atmosphere, every street you drive down seems different, littered with detail and interesting visuals. The games score is up there with both the Original and Mafia 2 in terms of quality, and the licensed radio soundtrack was pretty strong aswell.

The story was adapted well from the original, some big changes were added but they didnt feel incompetent or sloppy, and had a satisfying conclusion. While I dont know if I would call this better than Mafia 2, I definently think this is night and day in terms of quality with Mafia 3, and I think this is one of the best period peice type games I have ever played.

20,Mafia Definitive Edition,76600192,english,"Like others have said this is a solid neutral recommendation, but without such an option I will have to leave a negative review. I never played the original so I have no idea how this stacks up and will be reviewing it as it stands on its own.

First i'll start with the positives. The game has an excellent score. The music is really a treat to listen to and sets the tone well. The world building is also extremely well done, listening to the radio talk about rising tensions in Europe was really engaging and I often found myself stopping to listen as I went about missions. For example as I was pulling up to an objective the news started talking about the Munich agreement foreshadowing WW2. Another good example is a world series match between some of the fictional teams in the Mafia universe and it reminded me of my great-grandfather talking about listening to the real match on the radio and how he'll never forget where he was. The final major success of the game is the graphics which look great.


[spoiler] Unfortunately thats where the good things end, at least for me. The worst thing is this game has so many moments where you think it's gonna blow you away only to leave you asking is that it? The game is about family and relationships and the core story arcs rely on these relationships but they fail to develop them properly. For example by the end of the game the central 3 characters are supposed to be the best of friends but the game jumps between missions which go across years so we never see the moments that make them so close. As a result whenever something happens to them its difficult for me to feel anything because we never see the memories they share so all the death and betrayal falls flat. Another issue is that the main character goes on to have a family but we only see the wife for maybe 15 minutes total and his children once in the final scene but they are the entire crux of the plot. Everything the MC does in the last couple of missions is for his family yet we don't even really know them. The supporting characters also do not get enough of a focus and the antagonists are defeated with no build up or ceremony so it ends up feeling as if I was killing some guy rather than my family's rival. [/spoiler]

[spoiler] Some technical issues exist as well. For one the control mapping is trash, doesnt support extra mouse keys and some commands cant be changed. For example Q is the light melee attack so when I switched my movement keys I kept randomly punching so I was forced to use garbage default controls. Another weird bug for those of you with multiple keyboard languages installed. The alt button is my shortcut for changing between my Japanese and English language pack and whenever I would alt in game it would change the language to Japanese and start typing in some weird box in the center of my screen. I have never had this happen before. The AI is terrible. There are more minor issues but I dont know if they are worth bringing up. [/spoiler]

The greatest sin of this game though is that the tommy gun is shit. How they managed to fuck up one of the most iconic aspects of 1930s gangsters is beyond me.

6/10
Mediocre but not terrible. Though I dont think it's worth the price and would refund it if I could. Avoid unless you like the franchise.

27,Mafia Definitive Edition,76599628,english,"Mafia: Definitive Edition is an excellent remake that keeps many of the core events from the original game but also alters the narrative, dialogue, mission structure as well as brings the gameplay, visuals and voice acting up to modern standards. In a way this feels like a Hollywood adaptation of a classic mob movie, an audiovisual treat that occasionally forgets some of the things that made the original better but manages to keep you hooked with its pacing and the more cutscene focused narrative direction.

As with modern titles, there are several difficulty options to choose from, including a classic difficulty mode which tries to emulate the difficulty of the original game and manages to do it pretty successfully, as combat is very lethal and the racing mission is as rage inducing as it was in the original game.

Remake uses Hangar 13's proprietary game engine, which has been updated from Mafia III. Fortunately a lot of the more glaring issues have been fixed, but sadly some of the technical shortcomings are still present in form of occasional physics and collision glitches, as well as rough animation transitions especially in melee combat.

Graphically the game looks good, although the daytime city is perhaps a little boring looking compared to the spectacular looking night time. In terms of audio, the game is a mixed bag, while the music and voice actors nail their parts, even if some of the new voice performances take a while to get used to - the overall audio mixing and especially the gun sounds are rather bad.

Gameplay is very similar to Mafia III with some improvements, especially the vehicle controls feel like they are probably the best they have been in the series thus far. Unfortunately the 3rd person combat feels rather outdated and the classic difficulty perhaps highlights this more than the others as small mistakes result in death very quickly and things like enemies being a little too bullet spongy outside of headshots, cover transitions being a little rough, melee combat being very barebones etc. start to be very noticeable - which in turn hurts the immersion a little.

That being said, I really enjoyed the roughly 10 hours it took to beat the game on the classic difficulty. While some of the diehard fans of the original may be disappointed to hear that the game isn't wholly faithful to the source material and takes liberties as you'd expect of a remake instead of remaster - I think majority of the changes were for the better.",1601130334,1601130363,TRUE,1,0,0.509803951,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,904,52,635,635,635,1601120109

-No ""money system"" in freeride
-Filling-up the car doesn't have that nice animation where a guy really fills your tank, also no money required
-Would have been nice to be able to mod your cars or something
-Physically parking the cars in Salieri's bar, not storing them ""virtually"" into a garage and repairs if needed at Betone's autoservice
-A few available jobs in freeride and better explore capabilities, more freedom: the airport is closed (nothingt to do there), can't buy houses, not so many hidden stuff

It feels like ""one time play"". The GTA V, for example after finishing the story you're still able to go to bars, play and interact with others giving the impression of a non-ending game.
Overall, as a modern mirror of the 1st Mafia is still impressive, so I do recommend the game, but still I hope there will be DLCs in the future that expands the capabilities of the game.",1601124925,1601124925,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,55,2,1040,1040,1040,1601117324

It took me to play through the game for about 9 hours at a reasonable pace to also explore the world but focus on the story. While I was playing the story, it felt well done and interesting and I could imagine playing through the story again. The main character Tommy Angelo who you get to play with felt good but also sad the further into the story you get.

The graphics update is a big plus after the previous version of Mafia from 2002. It can be said that 2K Games has taken the graphics from Mafia 3 and then changed and adapted for Mafia. It felt a bit like they almost played Mafia 3 a part of it but still not really.

If you are interested in the Mafia series, it is a matter of course that you start playing this version of Mafia first before you start on Mafia 2 and then on Mafia 3. Both games have a connection in the story.

The game felt well optimized I was steady 60 fps or higher with a GTX 1070 and AMD Ryzen 5 1600X I could drop down to 40 fps in some scenario but it was very few times they happened. The game's graphics maxed out everything at max.

Pros+
-Captivating story
-One of the best lighting in videogames, as far as I can remember.
-Reflections on puddles and wet roads during nights are jaw-dropping.
-Clean textures but not the best in modern games.
-Driving is improved and is the best of the series
-Voice acting is superb
-Little details make up for immersion like simulated traffic rules, manual transmission, etc.
-Price

Cons- (I might be wrong in some, since Ive only played for 8 hours)
-No photomode
-Linear story
-Semi-open world
-Not much to do in terms of interacting with npcs
-as far ive played, limited character customization (clothes, weapons and such)
-Minor bugs, like model freezing upon death but not game breaking.

Cant wait for the next Mafia game though, I hope the developers use this game as a stepping point towards the next entry in the series.

But i have some small complaints, well first that are some minor bugs and glitches, one of my friends have purchased the games but the game would just crash from the first mission. The new gun inventory system is kinda stupid to be honest, for example if you only had 1911 and wanted to pick up the revolver you had to ""swap"" it for some reason, but if you picked up a bigger gun like shotgun it would let you keep both. In the original you could even keep two pistols and two bigger guns. I wish if there was some of the Lucas Bertone missons like it was on the first one, maybe he would reward you with some really good cars. The game felt really easy on the medium difficulty so you might want to crank it up to high right away. But the gameplay overall was very fun, the story is still amazing til to this day.

83,Mafia Definitive Edition,76593168,english,"This remake is really great, especially if you played the Mafia series. It REALLY highlights the moments in the old 2002 game.

Storyline is GREAT, most of the old missions are there, with a few little changes...but only for the good! As a huge fan, i really enjoyed playing the story missions refreshed like this!!!

Characters are memorable!!! Just like the old game, the npc dynamic with you is really great! Voice actors are good! And it can get all emotional, just like the old game used to be. In contrast with the Mafia 3, where i can't actually remember one single npc, this game here.... makes every character in the same manner like they were 18 years ago. Full of life and emotions, you develop connections trough the game, and get attached to the people around you (even tho' i played it before and i know all the betrayals that happen). Anyways, big up for reconstructing characters like this!

Graphics, and the City - are reeeaaaaallyyyy nice. Goddamn, this game is as beautiful as it gets. I love the fact that they reconstructed the map so well, adding all the details, Lost Heaven has come to life! All the streets, old spots, bridges, everything is there!!! but retouched in a way that makes nostalgia really hit ya!
Atmosphere of the 1930 Mafia 1 is there! And it never been better! Cars feel the same, as the old game! But you can actually visualise the fact that some cars will drive faster than others, and progression is actually really nice!

As a conclusion, if you enjoyed Mafia 1 and 2 back in the old days, you will deffo enjoy this game, nostalgia will burn ya. I was so skeptical after playing Mafia 3, but this game HITS WHERE IT NEEDS TO. I don't understand the people that complain about the few changes that happen: they REPAIRED the clunky and shitty things from the old game!!!

Do understand that a lot of options from the original disappeared. Levels are less open for you to experiment. There's much more handholding and cinematic experience added. But it didn't bothered me as it was still challenging and fun to play through. Bugs can be annoying though. I saw visual glitches, no sounds in cinematics, enemies with god mode on, 60hz fullscreen, button remaps that couldn't be done, etc... but I got over it somehow. Not worth €40..maybe €20-30?

But
There are so many problems with it 
First , the voice over is terrible
Second , there are a ton of freezes for no apperant reason , i have a fairly good rig so its not due to resource problems
It just freezes at random times ( once when i opened the Menu inside the game , another time it froze in a cut scene etc)
it also froze once to a point where i could not close the game down , the mouse driver was stuck in game so i could not use it to click on anything (thank god for the TAB key) i had to sign out of the PC to make it close the program (no other window would come to the forground)
in addition a lot of the side missions from the original are missing , its as if they just took the story to make you finish the game quickly ( i went ahead and stopped doing missions directly just to see the city)
and the worst part for me is that they won't allow you to aim the weapon yourself when in a car chase (even when the aim assist is off)  - this was a major part of the fun in the original game - getting that shot to the whell that made the enemy car turn over or get the driver - it was fun , not you just drive and click on the fire button until the other guy is dead - terrible design

95,Mafia Definitive Edition,76591538,english,"Gonna rate the different parts on a scale from 1-10

Story -- 8

The story is good, although its pretty much just a reskinned version of the one we got back in 2002.
Some dialogs have been changed, but its not that impactful. The charecters do a good job telling the story, and it is presented nicely. 
I love a good mobster story, always been a fan of Godfather, Scarface and the like. This does not give me the same sense of being a gangster, not quite.
Still it aint bad at all.  

Graphics -- 6.5
	
The graphics are decent in my opinion. They are what you pretty much come to expect, of games releasing nowadays. Sometimes the game looks kinda bleh, and sometimes it looks really good. 
The weather effects are good, and a welcome change, from the original. The charecters to me, is a hit and miss. Some look good, some look weird. 
Tommy looks good most of the time, but he does some weird faces when talking to people, mostly in the start of the story.
Paulie looks like at hippo. 
The cars are nicely done, and the smaller streets are very atmospheric. Car damage is good too, but not something mindbreaking. 
Alot of lesser npcs are dublicated. Same hair, same face and the same cloth. Sometimes walking right by eachother. 
	
The different mission locations are nice enough. They are different, and have a distinct feel. 

Sound -- 5

The sounds of the cars is decent. Never been a huge fan of the way they make them sounds generally. Mafia 3 had this problem too in my opinion. They make a v8 sound like an electric car. 
Same goes for this game sometimes. Some of the really old cars, with small motors, are the ones sounding mostly like their real counterpart. 
The motorcycles sounds great though. Like the old harleys, tuff tuff, tuff tuff, tuff tuff. And then you rev it, it has a good loud sound. 

The city sounds are good, but also not something that you would not expect from a 2020 title. 

Gameplay -- 3

Now this is where the game really lets me down. The gameplay feels bad man.
Gonna split this up too. 

AI --

The AI is pretty bad in most cases. Pedestrians jumping in front of cars, instead of away from you. The wanted system is very lackluster, I actually think that the system from Mafia 3 was way better. 
And now I know, that they maybe want to keep it close to the original, but in my opinion they should have expanded it, giving that they have the tech to do it pretty easily now. 
You can shoot 5 pedestrians dead in the street, wait for the cops to magically get the info, then go hide behind a barrel, and watch the cops drive right past you, and the 5 dead people. With the comment ""Hes gone, we gonna get him next time"".
Its so lazy. They dont even stop to check on the bodies, check the crimescene, og look for you in the area. They drive by, look to both sides, shit he aint there, gotta get home and ge ma donugts.
The friendly AI is pretty dumb too. Walks right out in front of multible gunmen with no care in the world. 

	Combat -- 
	
The shooting is pretty much copy pasted from Mafia 3, and although the shooting is not that bad in Mafia 3, the carry over is done poorly. 
The cover system is pretty clunky, the Ai is nuts, and is able to hit you through cover sometimes, and when you play on classic, that makes it pretty hard to get through some levels. 
The shooting is alright, the weapons feel fine, but they felt fine in Mafia 3 aswell. The practical placement of explovesives through the levels, looks good enough when they blow up. 
But the game lacks a sense of realism. The mission where you had to kill the hotel manager, and blowup his office. I went straight up to him, pulled out my gun, and shot him in the eye. 
Then I turned around to focus on the other punks in the room, but to my surprise, motherfucker wasnt dead. He patted his head a few times, let out a cry, then carried on to pull his gun on my like thats the most natural thing in the world. 
Surviving a headshot is alright, that happens. But being able to fight afterwards seems like a stretch. And this has happeneded more than once, og classic difficulty. 
You cant take alot of shots on classic, which is fine by me. But you can shoot some punk 5 times, and he rubs it off like nothing. And its a shame, cause the ""wounded"" animations are in place it seems. 
When you shoot a guy in the arm or leg. They limb for a time, but recover without few seconds like nothing has happened. Now I am not saying that they should lay down and die, but maybe shift arm of something. 

The melee combat is bad. If you attack a guy with a bat, and he hits you with his hands, while they ""Counter"" button is present, even though you are to hit him with the bat first, you will still take the damage and the stagger from his hit, cause you did not press the counter. 
Its not very realistic at all. And the executions look bad. Most of the time I found that in the scripted execution my hits did not even connect, and sometimes Tommy would kick out in the air, and the opponent would still ""act"" like he got kicked in the face. 
It seems to me that it has not been played through a great deal by the devs.

Well the world is pretty empty, cant do much aside from finding collectibles. Its a shame, cause the world is really well done. Lots of storefronts, different districts, cafes and the like, but all just for show. 
Its a pretty huge stepdown from Mafia 2-3. And now I know that this is not a sequel, but a prequel, but they had the chance to pull something great here, but they focused mainly of the story. Which is why, you do not get a breather 
while doing story missions, cause you cant do much aside from doing story missions. 

I aint asking much, but it would have been nice to see some working shops. A tailor where you could dress your charecter the way you wanted him to look, and not some prefabricated outfits. A hairdresser, a car mechanic/Customizer. 
Working bars and saloons. Rackets to visit. Many posibilities that seems possible to do with the tech nowadays. 
	
Also, the weapons are very limited in my opinion. A couple handguns, a shotgun, a tommygun and a rifle. 

Little things -- 

I always liked Mafia and Mafia 2 for the details. Speed limiter, turn signals and so on. Nothing has really carried through to this ""Definitive"" edition. 
You cant interact with things like you used to, be it lightswitches or pedestrians. There is a fuel gauge on the cars and motercycles. Now I have not tried running a car dry to see if it actually works.
But I have tried shooting up a bike with a full tank, put 10 holes in the fuel tank and watch it go up in smoke. Then I climb back on the motorcycle, and although it wont start, it stills shows a full tank. 
These things arent gamebreaking at all, but its the details that make a game go from good to great, in my opinion. 


Final Score - 5.5 out of 10. 

Verdict: Decent game, but play it for the story mainly cause there aint much else. 
Now I have not really done any reviews before, so it might be a bit unstructured sorry for that. English is not my motherlangauge either so theres that.

My computer isn't a potato neither. Once I finally got it to play, the issues didn't quit. The game will start hitching in spots seemingly without any real reason. Eventually, the game engine seems to just lock up altogether. Once again, Alt + Tab out and back in will cause the game engine to resume. 

The final straw was when I switched from Mouse and Keyboard to Controller for the driving. When I tried to go back to the keyboard, none of the inputs would respond. I just went back to playing the game with my controller. I later died and the game would no longer allow me to progress because it would not respond to any button inputs from the controller.

Great Textures, especially the cars. Very nice that they took the old textures into account for some of the more memorable cars (Bolt Ace, Silver Fletcher), I saw some different interpretations of cars from that era and they looked sweet too.
Damage Models are also good, the ""winged"" hoods of the era opening / actually being functional especially.
The Face / Body Textures are subpar considering it's 2020, nothing to complain about at least when it comes to the main cast, all other NPCs I encountered so far are a complete atrocity to look at.
For whatever reason Hangar 13 must've decided that it would be a good idea to make every character be in their late 20s / early 30s, with the blandest faces I've seen in a long time. Really threw me off when I got stopped by police and both officers had no facial features at all, just two bland completely indistinguishable tweens in uniform. Big step back from the original, those faces carried ambience and character.
If you take away the clothing, Lucas Bertone / Ralphie / Sam / Thomas are all very samey, maybe except for the nose on Thomas. What a fuck up. Hopefully at some point Game Developers start designing faces again instead of just using the voice actors as a base. There's a reason they are voice actors, and there's a reason why Joe Pesci
and Paul Sorvino were real actors, they are interesting to look at and not as cookie cutter as these guys whoever they are.

[b]Music[/b]
I had high hopes when I heard the reiteration on the Mafia Theme in the intro cinematic and main menu.
Too bad that the remake of the first video game to feature Django Reinhardt (+ the Mills Brothers) couldn't afford him this time around. No ambient tracks at all in the city and so far I didn't hear any tracks that come close to the old ones. Why no La Verdine / Latchodrom, the legendary track in Running Man? Guess I'll have to put on a playlist of the original tracks myself while playing, what played in the Radio so far was accurate for the era perhaps but a complete miss of the 2002 version ambience.

[b]Weapons[/b]
No licenses were acquired from Colt etc., sad but understandable with Hangar 13s track record.
Obviously no fans of the 2002 original were at work in this department, otherwise the nickel finish and shooting sound that made the 1911 ""the"" trademark pistol of Tommy would've made it into the game.
The other major gripe is the ""Service Revolver"" (so originally the S&W Model 10 MP), through some miracle the police of Lost Heaven decided that they need something different and are carrying a generic .44 Magnum Revolver. This didn't prevent implementing the Magnum Revolver Mafia additionally had in 2002, it just means that there are two weapons that look samey, have identical shooting sound and are only different in what damage maybe. Great!

[b]Handling[/b]
Handling is a huge part of the 2002 original, some will know that Mafia was originally designed as a Racing Game.
This still shows in the realistic weight the cars, and makes driving frustrating at times and rewarding once you progress.
This has been reiterated in a good way, it's a pretty casual experience but in general pleasant, they've even included manual shifting.
Only gripe is that they didn't pay any attention to a cars weight and height, resulting in the Bolt Ace suddenly being an okay car when back in 2002, you really felt like driving an underpowered, prone-to-falling-over piece of shit, making your first Falconer to take home in Molotov Party that much more remarkable.

[b]UI[/b]
It can't be configured at all, nice touch! Very obstructive and immersion-breaking, probably will be patched though.

[b]Story[/b]
I didn't think I would need to comment on the story.
Seems I didn't know it good enough though, I didn't remember that Sam and Paulie spouted some preachy ""Yeah we're really bad guys too"" every time they open their mouths, especially boasting about crippling a guy right after Salieri said not to rough people up too much. Salieri had an unnerving ""holier-than-though"" attitude that was backed up by the gang and even the people they extorted, maybe Hangar 13 skipped some cutscenes or played on mute to miss that, who knows.
Morello has become the big bad of every mission too, this takes away from the ""normal"" Mafia life missions of the beginning.
Their attempt at expanding on the story falls flat when it comes to Thomas' motivation to join the mob as well.
In the 2002 version, his motivation is mostly one of desperation / nihilism, after initially saying no to Sams ""invitation"", he is confronted with the fact that Morellos goons are going to come after him no matter what. It's a pretty iconic moment to have him go from ""Better die poor and old"" to ""Better die young and rich"". This time around, he initially says no , has the ""Better die poor"" moment, gets confronted by the goons BUT instead of doing what Illusion Softworks did back then or anything interesting, he just gets a big old Revenge boner, begging Salieri to be allowed to go after several mobsters and rough them up.
This really fucks up his progression as a character, instead of starting as a driver that had to do some dirt to prove himself initially and only ever touches a gun when he needs to save Sams life or when Sarahs assailants draw guns on him and Paulie, Thomas is now a full on angry mobster right from mission 2, with Paulie, Sam and him making light of murder etc. as if he had been a violent criminal all his life. The fact that every melee kill is a straight up homicide instead of just incapacitating really hammers home that whoever wrote this just didn't get the original progression of the character / desperately wanted to do sth bland instead.
Oh, and btw: Thomas Angelo was a war participant (literally mentioned in the first cutscene of the 2002 game), since Hangar 13 wanted to make him younger they decided to ignore this. Whatever suits them, why this was pointed out in every trailer as a feature is pretty embarassing though.

[b]Gameplay[/b]
Daniel Vavra called it on twitter a few months ago, and sadly it's true.
It's a scripted, rail-roaded shit show from start to finish as soon as action is involved, sorry to say but this makes is not be action. Vavra must've been shown material by Hangar 13, how else could he have known that their understanding of mission building and gameplay is so lacking? Melee combat is a consistent two button QTE with a finishing animation sprinkled on top, AC 1 did it back in 2007, except they made it fun and challenging of course.
Firefights really bring to mind flash games from the 2000s era, with you being static behind some cover and waves of enemies spawning in. I never could've played that crap for more than 5 minutes back then, nice graphics and big red barrels (props to Vavra) don't really change that.
Epitome of this so far is ""Better get used to It"": Instead of advancing through an alley having a challenging firefight against 6 guys with some that take cover, some that get blasting immediately and two guys charging you, what do you do?
Get into cover on a balcony, watching ten guys get into cover and then stay there and take shots at you. Kill them? Perfect! Proceed 10 steps and the next wave of 5 - 10 targets will spawn in, with another batch of red barrels nearby. I've played good cover based shooters before, seeing as there is literally no tactical or even relevant behaviour from the enemies this can only be compared to a shitty flashgame though.
Auto-Aiming while shooting out of a car, a ""Ram"" button and a shittier version of NFS Undercover obstacle mechanics to get rid of pursuers manage to make car chases boring as well.

Never Played Mafia 1, but played both of the other titles. I found it great that there is a remake just now so I can experience the first game finally without shitty graphic.

Honestly i feel kinda disapointed in the game. I just tought there was more to it than just 10 hours of ""playtime""(includeing a lot of cutscenes, that im aware of, are important because this game focuses hard on the storytelling and sometimes felt more like a movie) to finish the whole game.

Shooting certainly has that older game feeling, you can make that quite difficult.

At first I was really confused about Tommy’s voice actor, because in the original he sounded like a modest, even somewhat shy guy. But “remastered” Tommy is as complex and likable character, even though he seems more confident (which grows over time just like in the original), he could also be shy (in the conversations with Sarah, for example). Relationships with Sarah is taken to a new level they show a lot more conversations between them and it’s much deeper (no sex on a first date 😀)

This remastered is true to the original while adding meaningful beats of story here and there and even if some characters slightly changed, it’s always some addition to their personality which feels very natural.
They also put some love and add small cool details like, for example, radio stutters when riding through a tunnel. And there are no mirrors in this game 🤣 Not that it bothers me at all, just saying.

The only thing I didn’t like is melee combat, but other then that it’s a strong title from any other perspective. I really recommend this.

It is essentially the Mafia 1 missions on a whole new engine but I remember Mafia 1 being more open than this. This game is almost an interactive drama. I guess I was expecting more of a Mafia 2 style but with the Story focus of Mafia 1.

 If you just want to play the Mafia 1 missions with graphics then you'll probably like this?



I can only get it to start 20% of the time, and when it does I have to switch it back to fullscreen and adjust mouse sensitivity.

A lot of graphical artifacts and general poor quality. Blurring on items that move especially wheels and hands. Resolution on people seems to drop unexpectedly and makes them suddenly look awful. Firex fx is also shoddy

Gameplay feels rather dated. I know this is based on Mafia 1 but it being 'built from ground up', I wasnt expecting this. Events feel on the rails and rather plain, just one basic mission after another. The physics are worse than Mafia 2, people fall and jump all wooden.  

Generally seems like they tried to hit but missed. Kept alot of things that shows the age but with true modern graphics its rather jarring.

The post-WWI, prohibition era, great depression were dire yet unique timelines which led to rise of Mafia and flavorful scenarios. 

I've been yearning for a game which is worthwhile and this is exactly what I wanted. I can't stress enough how much I enjoy listening to the Irish and the Italian American accents. All the sit downs are immersive with a lot of depth in the dialogues. The characters are overhauled and presented gracefully. The graphics are quite good for the most part, especially the beautiful reflections quality. The texture, environment, terrain, lighting, shadow quality are top-notch. 

The gameplay is great overall. Driving is fun. Hand-to-hand combat is mediocre with little complexity. The movement & shooting do not feel heavy enough which makes it way too fast paced and unmethodical.
  
The game has some issues with refresh rate which is an easy fix but runs flawlessly.
I play at 1080p with all settings cranked up.

With these specs on board:
CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 2700X Eight-Core Processor 3.9GHz
GPU: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 Ti Black SuperClocked 11GB
RAM: Corsair Vengeance LPX 16GB DDR4 3000MHz

I'm getting strong 70-80 fps in while driving in the city, 100+ during cut scenes and interiors,
80ish during gunfights and explosions, can drop to 60s while driving in the city during nighttime.

Nevertheless, this game is a hit. I played it for the story! Grab and play it now!

You get two crappy XB1 layouts to choose from, and only one of them even has shift up/shift down bound. You can't bind clutch to the controller at all. If you want manual clutch, you have to use keyboard. 

Meanwhile, I can start up the original 2002 Mafia and bind my XB1 controller however I like, even adjusting linearity and deadzone of the axes, basic functionality that is completely missing from the Definitive Edition.

The best part? External remapping programs don't work - it doesn't intercept the input before it reaches the game, so you end up triggering both functions at the same time. Using the Steam Big Picture/Steam Controller remapping system breaks the game, so that my mouse is invisible and the option to rebind keyboard keys is grayed out. I have wasted 3+ hours trying and failing to get a usable control scheme working, something that would take 30 seconds in any other game. Oh, and you also can't bind the mouse wheel to anything.

I have no idea how this game came to be in its current state - the broken input system absolutely prevents me from playing the game at this point, since the default button layouts are terrible and there is literally no functional way to rebind them, regardless of what external software I use. If I can rebind keyboard keys, why the hell can't I rebind controller buttons?

I also had a cutscene glitch out and not play properly, and I now have no way to watch the cutscene, as loading my last checkpoint puts me in the gameplay after the cutscene, and my only other option is to start a new game.

Having almost completed the Definitive Edition, I can only applaud Hangar 13 for recreating the entire game with reverence and respect to the original, while adding new story content for more depth, and making Lost Heaven a bustling, authentic 30's city shining bright in new, beautiful graphics.

What you (want to) get out of the game though is totally up to your own expectations of it. For people who haven't played the 2002 classic, this game will probably not stand out except for the story telling and beautiful graphics design. As a Mafia 'veteran', I did not expect Mafia: DE to become a 'revolutionary' new game-recreation with a massive open world and tons of side quests to cater to the drifts of current trends and over-hyping marketing departments.What I had were high expectations for it to become an hommage to an all-time game classic that revolutionized storytelling in it's day, staying true to the core elements of the original.

Granted, I was a bit skeptic when I saw that basically every persona in the game had been re-designed and re-voiced (the latter being less surprising), leaving almost no recognizable traits for fans of the 2002 game. Only Frank and Sarah seem to have been unaltered in appearance and character (Sarah actually got more personality) for most parts. The entire cast, from Tommy to Morello, seem to have undergone 'rejuvenation'. Paulie isn't the grouchy and easily agitated middle-aged guy anymore, and Vincenzo seems to have lost a few pounds. Sam kinda remains the sober, almost bitter character he was in the original, and is the only character I wish would have gotten a bit more depth. The new Italo-American accents are brilliant though and fit very well into the setting. Storywise, the cutscenes and character sequences provide a richer experience over the original, adding useful details lost in the original, and letting us see Tommy (and others) from a completely different angle. He seems much less guilt ridden than the original Tommy at first, but the new 'Better get used to it' and 'A trip to the country' missions will teach you otherwise.

In terms of content, Lost Heaven has become a vibrant city with a lot of new additions, like motorcycles, 2 authentic 30's era radio stations (even with some real historic references and voice clips, like FDR's great depression speeches), and a lot more detail on vehicles, shops and neighborhoods. The map layout has undergone some redesigns here and there, which show some parts in a totally new light. 

The weapons all have made it back from the original game, yet they are my biggest 'negative' experience of the game. Don't get me wrong, shootouts and car chases are still fun (yet in some parts a bit dumbed down), but the combat mechanics are lackluster and the overall weapon feeling in my opinion is worse than the original. While there is some minor bullet deviation that luckily doesn't make this game a full spray and pray opera, shooting feels much less 'weighted'. I mean, come on, nothing beats that awesome sound and recoil feeling that the original Thompson had in 2002, and now it just feels like a superlight machine gun.

Anything else? Yeah, exploring the city in between missions has almost completely gone out the window and is moved entirely to the 'free roam' play style, Lucas Bertone's car collection missions have become an afterthought, and cops generally are more 'forgiving' (although u can change that in options).

In conclusion, this remake has done almost everything right, and deserves a solid 7,5/10!",1601075909,1601110173,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,66,5,1035,1035,370,1601327799

90,Mafia Definitive Edition,76582906,english,"Oh Man. This game is a far cry from from the normal mafia games. Its closer to a PG-rated, binge worthy Netflix series that you drive and shoot through, than your typical open world RPG with a deep non-linear story that the rest of the series is known for. It gives you a taste of all things that made the Godfather a great film, but leaves out most of what makes a game fun. Each chapter play out a little differently than the previous, keeping it somewhat enjoyable to watch, but more than half were the typical linear murder sprees you find in any mafia game. The story is as expected, but they could have embellished a little more with new cutscenes or something, something more than just a HD remake. Even the controls are still pretty bad.
Final notes; If you're in it for the movie, play on easy. If you're in it for the gameplay, either move on or enjoy replaying the same 20 minute checkpoints until you either throw your controller or switch back to easy so you can move on.

It doesn't and that's not entirely a bad thing because that only means they focused on what we actually wanted from the game. You can see that the devs knew that this game was about refreshing the whole thing for a gen of folks who didn't play the original. The gunfights are alright but not stellar and the driving is stiff... but the story? man oh man... the characters?... the soul of this game is intact. Also, for the OGs, remember that race mission? Yeah... it's still there and as hard as ever.

Now, one thing that breathes new life in this baby is the faces. I'm surprised at how well animated those faces are when the gameplay isn't but it's got to be two different technologies for sure. Those cutscenes are gold... just make it a movie man. I'd watch it. But seriously, this is the game we loved and nobody knew about.

29,Mafia Definitive Edition,76578714,english,"I just recently finished the game so I figured I'd give my thoughts. Overall this is a great game and I'm honestly surprised that Hanger 13 didn't screw it up like last time. The story is incredible and still holds up to this day, although some changes to the story were made they're nothing that really takes a lot of liberty away from the original (There's also a free roam but there's nothing noteworthy about it). One new addition is collectables, mostly comics and pulp magazines from the time which are easy enough to find. One collectable was great if you're a huge fan of the series like I am though, they're ciggarette cards with mobsters on them who are characters in all 3 games although much younger, guys like Leo Galante, Carlo Falcone and the Marcano brothers to name a few. On the flip side however there's also ""Hidden Foxes"" which are pointless collectables that you get in the story and free ride and since there's 50 of them nobody but achievement hunters will care since that's all you get as far as I know.The voice acting and graphics are incredible and the general aesthetics are very well done. In terms of combat it's a straight forward cover based shooter. I did have some stuttering in the later missions but nothing major, maybe three or four times that lasted maybe 1-2 seconds. I've only experienced 2 major glitches in my time, one where after I beat up thugs in an alley the mission wouldn't proceed and I had to reload and do the fight over again, and the second time in the last mission where the character you're chasing got stuck in a wall for me, thankfully I ran down the hall where he was meant to go and a cutscene fixed the problem. Some mafia 3 assets have been reused interestingly enough, the two biggest I noticed came in the cover based stealth takedowns Tommy does and secondly in one mission after a robbery the bag containing the money has the state of Louisiana on it like the bags used in the prologue mission of Mafia 3. In the end I was nervous about this game as I'll be honest, I don't like Hangar 13, they did a great job on the remake and deserve credit for it and apart from the few moments that I have mentioned I can honestly say it's a great game and I enjoyed every second of this game (Something I can't remember happening last) a solid 9.5 minimum in my opinion",1601099905,1601100405,TRUE,2,0,0.543859661,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,166,19,571,571,571,1601098853
30,Mafia Definitive Edition,76578926,english,"While this game is visually spectacular. With an opening sequence lasting near 5 minutes establishing the city it self. I cannot recommend the game.

Lets get to the bad first.
The game play here is long establishing cut scenes and then a short mission. I am currently 4 hours into the game and have only had one almost open mission. But this is by no means open like you would find in a Witcher game. And lets face it The Witcher is the gold standard in a story based RPG in my opinion.

In the game play I have gone through, I have been on a total rail road. I have no choices. Not even ones which make no difference in the game. This is very much lazy development. The only freedom I have seen is just enough to find the ""collectables"" which mean absolutely nothing to the game itself. There is not even an illusion of freedom found in most games. But a direct point A-B-C-D-E.

Movement in the game has the same speed limiter the cars have. It is rare to be able to run. As such there are prolonged scenes (and missions) where you are just walking from place to place. And this is a slow stroll at best.

The pacing of the game is just too slow for me to continue much further in the game. It really is that slow and I have not seen any indication (other than the latest mission) that it might improve. And this is 4 hours into a game where I am already close to giving up. It is not good and boarder line terrible.

The key placement is just ridiculous. I am using a keyboard because I do not play consoles. And the key placement is terrible. In the rare times you get into fights your hand is twisting to dodge. While you are frantically clicking to attack on your mouse. But ""Q"" is the melee key.

The good
The writing is not spectacular, but it establishes the characters around you and of course the stories. But because these are usually presented in establishing cut scenes or idle chatter while driving. It just feels tiresome.

The driving in the city is certainly good fun. The cars take time to speed up and the suspension is sloppy on some cars. I love that the city is alive with people walking across the roads and you have a speed limiter to not get busted by the police. That said I have driven past the police at speed and they did nothing. I hope that was just a one time thing. Another thing to talk about with the city driving. When you get to an intersection a directional sign is there when you have a keyed in destination. This allows you to drive a little more naturally without reliance on the map.

The Great
The music track and look of the game.
This is absolutely where the game shines though I am running it on max settings on a very beefy GPU (and hi quality sound device).",1601100302,1601100302,FALSE,5,4,0.231924012,3,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,503,16,255,255,255,1601096461

also adding in more of a sense of free roam by not forcing you to do every mission then and there would have been nice but I understand the point was Tommy telling the story to the detective. ;)

61,Mafia Definitive Edition,76563054,english,"Mafia: Definitive edition is the game that absolutely did better than the classic game in every aspect.

The characters are interesting, the city is lively, and hey! The Italian people actually speak Italian!

I pre-purchased the game right when the news was out that it's available on Steam Store, months of waiting, was totally worth it. 

Gameplay:-

Everything has been refined. I didn't have a hard time reading the map like I did in the classic version, the guns work perfectly even though handling them can be a bit of a pain since you are provided with absolutely low ammo and the protagonist isn't experienced with them, the gunfights at times can be a little challenging.

You need to time your movements in situations of this sort, one false move and you might have to restart the checkpoint.

The vehicle handling can be a little tricky, but you can be a drift king in no time. I absolutely loved it.

Some animations are a bit of a turnoff but bearable like the throwing of grenades, choppy melee combat animation (I personally prefer Mafia II's hand to hand combat more) even though the finishing moves are nice. There might be other things but I really didn't care to notice them.

Other than that, the game is absolutely stunning in terms of visuals.

This is exactly how the remakes SHOULD be done. Same atmosphere, same feel, just slicker visuals.

If you are an old-school Mafia fan like me, I'd suggest you to play the game on Classic difficulty, it's just like the old days. New fans, take it as a challenge.

Story:-

The game's story is exactly what the classic game had. Except for a few minor changes that made the story even better.

Remember the infamous racing mission in the classic game? The moment that separated true fans from rage quitters? It's back and it's a nightmare. It took me 23 tries to win the race and I played on Classic Difficulty with Manual Transmission of the Vehicle.

The character development progresses throughout the story and it is not exclusive just to the protagonist, but every person who play a role in the story.

Even though I already knew the fate of the characters, they got me so hooked into the game that I didn't want to lose them at all despite the fact, that I was aware how it'd end.

In the final chapter of the story, I drove around, smiled, ""The best remake you could ever ask for"" was what I said to myself, as I already knew what was going to happen. But also, that this time it'd end with more perfection.

character mechanics and facial expressions (Drunk guy walks normal and also no facial expression of a drunk guy) It clearly shows the limitation of that engine. I wish they used UE or Unity with Magascan textures and stuff.. 
Sunlight and environmental lighting 
Purposefully reduced quality setting instead of giving Ultra settings
Purposefully locking graphics configuration file so that we cannot go to ultra setting even if you have powerful computer

88,Mafia Definitive Edition,76573985,english,"The good: 

1) Graphics are pretty;
2) Nice to revisit a childhood game and sate the nostalgia;
3) Probably the only game in the universe where Thompson hasn't the recoil of MG42.

The neutral:

1) Even though Lost Heaven is a fictionary city, there's now a ton of real-life 1930th context. Expect to hear about Prohibition, Nazis and the President's speeches instead of all those memorable songs you loved from the original. To be honest, it doesn't really improve the game or adds anything meaningful to it.

2) Dozens of collectibles to gather like in recent titles, if you're a fan of that. Sadly, no pin-up girls this time.

3) Some characters got a bit of additional dialogue and screentime. Same time, other characters lost it. Give and take really.

4) The game feels like an action movie now, with exploding red barrels, escaping from an armored truck with machine gun, a dozen copcars protecting Morello while you're chasing him. Totally different feel than the original had, for better or for worse.

The bad:

1) The game is very short - and even shorter than the original. They really cut out lots of cutscenes or shortened them, killing all the tension and suspense in the process. Remember you had a talk with Ralphie and Vinnie before every mission - well forget it, you only interact with them a couple of times now. Many missions are also shorter which didn't do good for some, they aren't as emotional or memorable anymore (if you want to find out how much it took to complete for me take away several hours while I felt asleep having it on still from my gametime). Lucas Bertone missions - probably the only side content of the story - are not a thing anymore.

2) The game is totally linear - the original was linear too, but you were really flexible with your approach and could get creative at times. For example, in Mafia if cops wanted to pull you over, you could get out of a car, shoot them and go on driving. In DE you are often limited to when you can pull out your gun. In Mafia, you could shoot the tires of a car in Regular Routine to make the subsequent chase easier. No such option in DE. In Mafia, you could avoid shooting Morello's plane alltogether, it was possible to shoot him on the way and get his Silver Fletcher. In DE, the mission is on rails and only plays one way. In Mafia you could use your molotovs to kill everyone inside Morello's bar, get their guns etc. In DE, you obviously can't. In Mafia, at some point you had access to alternative source of weapons in Hoboken and could gear up for the last mission, or you could go just with your detective special if you wanted. In DE, no such option anymore. Et cetera, et cetera.

3) There is no replayability - no point or desire to come back it to it. And not really any post-game content either. Mafia had a) freeride, where you could shoot gangsters, earn money and buy weapons and b) freeride extreme, where you could do small missions/challenges. It wasn't ambitious, but it was there. In DE's freeride you start in the bar, pick your suit, your guns and your ride and.. that's it, basically.

4) Some of the dialogue/story/plot changes are arbitrary and make no sense. They change the characters and their motivations, sometimes in a weird way. Moreover, the ""message"" of the game is also different this time and the way the final scene is handled is.. weird. 

The verdict:

Mafia was an impressive and very progressive game for its day and age. DE is not bad, but not that good either. Words like ""passable"", ""unmemorable"" and ""generic"" come to mind.

It has good features, sure, but they mostly come from Mafia 3, and frankly Mafia 3 is a better game than this one - at least it has open world, more gameplay options, more mechanics and more opportunities for the shooting which is the better part of Mafia 3 and consequentally of Mafia DE as well. 

So if you're an old fan of the original, you're likely won't be happy how they treated the source material and cut content. If you liked Mafia 3 you will feel confined here with how linear and claustrophobic this game is. If you're just looking for a shooter, there are better shooters.

But get it on sale some day, even if just for the story. You might like it, especially if you never played the original back in the day.",1601091706,1601091904,FALSE,1,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,287,28,1082,1082,872,1601347189

Being that I only have played the second and third installments, and never got to play the original, I have to say that Mafia Definitive Edition is a game that outshines the others, but with some technical issues worth mentioning. There is ghosting, pop ins, and in some occasions, playing thru the cut scenes a car chase usually ends up with the car behind you, being launched in the air in front of you, like back to the future and into the sky it goes.  The game starts off slow, but when you get a hold of a gun, that's where the fun starts. It feels flush, and for those complaining there are not enough weapons, remember, we are taking back in 1930, before the war. This was prohibition, and it shows it as best, as well as the great depression. If Mafia is making a 4th installment, they should definetely look into making it this way, or in this setting because at times, this game feels like it is Mafia 4. The city feels fresh and new, and has moments where you feel like a true gangster. With fresh new looks to the character, and stunning details to the world and landmarks, it truly is a great game brought up from the ground up. If the graphics didn't stutter, wasn't plagued by bugs, or had more to do with it after beating the game, then I would say jump aboard the gangster train, but at this point and time, I feel the 40 dollar price point is a tad steep. May pick this up on the next gen systems when it is cheaper, and can run games at 4K 60fps, but for pc, it just feels boring without anything to do afterwards. If they update this game and add new fresh content, it will be worth it, but as of now, I would wait till the bugs are fixed, and wait for it to come around 20 dollars.

99,Mafia Definitive Edition,76573034,english,"Played it through in one sitting because I couldn't put it down once I started. I did play the original but I don't remember much of it. Not that you need to because even if you come to this game completely fresh, it feels like an entirely new game in the series instead of a remake. The acting and animations are absolutely phenomenal. The graphics are gorgeous and everything from the character models to the vehicles and environment look amazing. It doesn't have the open world or any of the rpg elements of Mafia 2 or 3, if anything the experience is a rather linear one (though you do have the option to explore the city freely after finishing the first chapter), but what this game does have is a gripping narrative that will have you hooked from just that first hour. Maybe, like me, you won't want to put it down once you start. A lot of what made this story such a compelling one was the acting and the quality of the facial animations. This game had me anxious, excited, overjoyed and in tears throughout. If you're into mob movies, you're a fan of the series or you just like being told a good story, you're definitely going to like this game. 

But is there anything bad to say about it? Sure, no game is perfect. But one thing that genuinely surprised me was the lack of any technical issues. To my memory, I cannot recall experiencing any glitches or graphical bugs for the entirety of my playthrough. I'm sure they exist, after all it's a deceptively big game, but I genuinely don't recall having experienced any. Also, the gameplay itself isn't revolutionary by any means. It's an intuitive 3rd person shooter, nothing you haven't done before. The game is here to tell a story, so the gameplay isn't as refined in my opinion as Mafia 2 or 3.
The only other bad things I can say about this are:
 1. the on foot movement is kinda clunky. 
 2. I still hate the racing mission (now that I do remember from the original)

the story is good but the actual gameplay is pretty thoughtless. Melee, gunplay, and driving are awful to mediocre - in that order. Extreme pop-in, frequent jank, stiff animations, and constant onscreen waypoints and markers kill immersion. i'll keep playing for nostalgia's sake but man does this just feel like mafia 3. I really wish a more talented Dev team working with a better engine was behind this.
if you need to have it, wait for a big sale and some patches. The story does seem to have been handled well which i am happy about. but, this is a videogame. It'd be nice if they made the actual 'game' parts interesting and not lowest common denominator generic.

26,Mafia Definitive Edition,76571268,english,"This remake largely does justice to the original.

Visually it looks stunning, performance wise its much more optimised than i ever expected, hell, i can run my 3d modeling apps in the background and still get 60 fps, and my PC isnt even super expensive.

Sounds are great, and the voice acting is fantastic, the dialogue is much better and less awkward than it felt in the original (altough some writing was excessive, especially for paulie)

The story by and large was done justice by this remake. i actually daresay the remake does it better for several reasons (spoilers ahead stop reading if you dont want to be spoiled)

The mission where you have to Assasinate turnbull by going via the old abandoned prison finally makes sense, in the original you went there and had to shoot all these squatting hobo's that resided there for, reasons ? it never made sense from any perpective, especially since the whole point of this mission was to quietly assasinate a politician without making a ruckus beforehand. 

now instead you dont have to shoot any of them, at best you run into two thugs that want to steal your stuff but you have a melee fight for that. no guns needed.

The relationship between tommy and sarah is fleshed out much, much further than it was in the original, making you feel way more empathic towards tommy's final decision. 

The ''just for relaxation'' mission finally makes sense as well in the remake. in the Original you went to steal a truck to get ''cigars'' which were actually hidden diamonds. Which from a story perspective makes no sense, its incredibly small time for the crew at that stage, plus cigars were not illigal, unlike booze when prohibition was still on.

Instead in the remake, you go out and steal the ''cigars'' which the don tells up front that they are actually diamonds, from a fed impound warehouse. which, later turns out to be drugs instead of diamonds, making the scam the don is trying to pull way more elaborate and shocking.

A con in the remade storyline is that the mission to assasinate morello's brother is much shorter, and entirely rewritten. Rather than the countless failed attempts on his life in the original, there is one failed attempt, taking away from the 
depictions of difficulty of manhunting that the original did have.

All in all i am very happy with this remake.

My hope for future Mafia games is restored IF they stick to the good story telling and make the gameplay smoother with more to do in the world like racketing, racing, turf wars, shootouts etc. if possible.

It's worth buying if you're a big fan of the original. If not, I'd say wait for a sale. 

The reason is that within 10 or so hours you'll play through the game and you'll see most of what is there to see. That's not necessarily a bad thing, the game is the right length but it is pricey for something that doesn't have much to do after completing the main story.

Pros:
- Great graphics and atmosphere.
- Excellent story, with great cutscenes and voice acting.
- Car handling is very good, driving is a lot of fun in this game.
- Pacing is done just right. There is very little 'filler' content to try and artificially increase playtime.

Cons:
- Combat and gunplay is good, but there are better third person shooters out there at this price point.
- There isn't much to do beyond the story.

I hope that they add some DLC so that the great graphics, car handling, and city doesn't go to waste as there is so much more potential. Perhaps a more fleshed out free play mode where you can buy and upgrade cars and weapons, houses/apartments, and work your way up in the city as a mobster.

41,Mafia Definitive Edition,76531002,english,"I just finished the story, doing freeride missions now. I'm Czech, played the original, loved it, disliked 2 and loved 3. The remake is definitively closer in gameplay to 2 than 3, at least on Hard difficulty, even if some animations seem lifted straight from 3. You don't have an inventory system anymore, just one primary one secondary, no grenades, only molotovs, which are pretty rare, stealth takedowns are more like 3 than original (which was awkward). Think they made these changes to make it harder after introducing checkpoints to the levels. The difficulty of the original is gone with checkpoints, cuts the playtime in half (imo not a bad thing). One thing they kept true is ammo scarcity. You're in a city, not a battlefield, there's no ammo laying everywhere, just a few boxes on a few levels. Overall combat difficulty has gone down, but still a tough game compared to modern standards. There are some missions that are still way too easy though. On the airport mission you can just bum rush the hangar door without clearing out the baddies, makes the following cutscene really funny.

Story wise they changed a few things. Tommy is more gung-ho at the start, weird for a cabbie but fits his Czech VA better. Czech dubbing is amazing, they hit it out of the park. English VAs seems excellent too, watched some streams and they are up to par. I do prefer the Czech Paulie, Peter Rychly's still got it. Paulie overall is an amazing character now, definitively the Joey of this one. Sam is more than just a random gangster, too, though I wish we could've had even more with him. Due to the garage system, Ralph lost pretty much 90% of his lines, that's sad. Vinny is hilarious, I'd buy a spinoff with a younger Vinny in a hearbeat. Otherwise not much to talk about, presentation is strong, lipsyncing is obviously done for the English VAs, but oh well, that's where the money is, the Don would approve.

Talking about presentation, in videos you notice a lot of pop-in textures, but strangely when I was playing I only noticed it once or twice, definitively less than in Mafia 3. Lighting is still weird, I don't know how to describe it, I guess the ambient occlusions effects are making it weird? Like if you compare Modern Warfare Azhir Cave - when you're out of the cave the insides are dark, when you are in the cave the outside is blinding. The inside light is soft with soft shadows, outside is bright with sharp shadows. But in Mafia 1 DE, when you go into a tunnel, the lighting is matte, and there are NO shadows, and the transition is really weird. It just looks better at night, or during weather effects. So same as mafia 3. Character models are the standout for me, although cars also look nice. Falling animation is really offputting, but you don't see it often. Other animations are fine. I had one bugged mission I had to restart because cut scene triggers broke and I had a static camera with tposing characters. Thankfully it was one of the shorter missions so I just did it once over for the laughs.

Overall I really liked it, some levels were more memorable than in the original (the squatter prison in particular), characters were given proper care and the stuff that was cut probably deserved to be cut. Some things like the police being too soft on you will undoubtedly anger more die-hard fans, but are understandable for a 2020 game. If you've never played the original, pick it up on a sale, or when the trilogy goes on sale. Or at least watch a playthrough of it for the story, it's really good.

The city and the enviroment feels really alive, even more than Mafia III.

cutscenes, animations and dialogue is just top of the line

driving is just as good as the original just more fluent, since its on a modern engine with modern physics
and you can actually drift somewhat, (won the race on my first try on sim driving because of that)

i would say the weakest part of this remake is the gunplay.
first of all the tommy gun didnt do justice to what we've seen in gangster movies, you dont realy use it to spray down a bunch of mafia dudes... (atleast i never got put in a situation where more than 2 people gathered, they just spread out so much) blind fire is absolutely trash animation wise and effectiveness wise aswell.
and if you dont use the cover mechanic you can hide your entire body behind a wall and still kill people aslong as your crosshair is directly on them... :'( bullets come out of the crosshair and not the weapon itself i guess

sit in cover and go for headshots with pistol got the ball rolling for me once i realised the tommy gun was trash, shotgun packs a punch and you feel the recoil through the screen and you can see it too, but it hits like a paintball gun beyond 2 meters.

just FYI it takes 10 minutes to die lmao the animation for you dying takes forever.

overall ill give it a 8/10
if they designed weapons and gunplay abit better i would bump it to 10/10

The game looks similar to Mafia III so if you didn't like the look of that its the exact same. It also feels really easy to escape the cops. The song for the credits also feels kinda tone deaf with the cut scene that happens before.

For some pros it has the speed limit and similar settings from Mafia II. It has a classic mode difficulty setting to better emulate the original (which is the mode you should play on). And a great story with better writing and cut scenes than the original although it still is the same story.

- CONS - 
-----------
- Tons of Glitches (bad lighting, textures, meshes, etc etc)
- Doesn't seem like there's anything  extra to do aside from the Story? 
- Freeride Mode is very boring (supposedly theres hidden secrets in the map etc?)
- Infinite Gas, they should've at least made this realistic, I think this worked in the original?
- I understand they tried to keep it true to the original but some extras like events and things to do would've been nice to at least throw in there especially after you beat the game.

So far, it's alright. Nothing to write home about, but it looks great, plays great, and is buoyed by great vocal performances. If you're coming into this skeptical and ready to hate this, you're not really going to like it (no shit, sherlock). But if you come in knowing it's flawed, knowing that they haven't made any major changes to flesh the world out in the last eighteen years (including side quests and a reason for the open world to even exist), you'll have fun. In many regards, it does feel dated, but if the original Mafia feels too archaic for you (original fans, don't laugh, people like this exist -- I'm one of them) it's a pretty good way of experiencing it with some modern touch-ups. And that's exactly what this is: a modern touch up. It doesn't go beyond any expectations you'd have for a remake of the original Mafia, it's just a faithful reinterpretation lacking in some of the smaller, finer details the original had.

My only major gripe is that the shooting feels really weightless and loose and has no real heft to it.

98,Mafia Definitive Edition,76565257,english,"This is how it is done right: Wonderful Remake of a great game!

[b]Graphics / Sounds[/b]
The graphics are crisp, the sounds of the cars and the environment are brilliant and so are the voices of the actors, too. I often just cruise the city to relax and find at all the great details they added everywhere. Reading the ads, listening to the people talking and looking at the great architectures everywhere in the city or outside of. Especially for that you can just cruise the city without the story line active.

[b]Story[/b]
The story itself is the best of the game. It is like a movie you take an active part in. Living the story of Mr. Angelo backwards is great to watch (better: play yourself). Every chapter has more than one wonderfully rendered cutscenes that get on with the story. At the end it cross fades to your character and you can actively continue the story.

[b]Gameplay[/b]
The movements of the character and cars are very good with a controller. Especially the cars can be driven very naturally and accurate (I never played with mouse / keyboard combo, so I can't tell about it).
The AI is good, there were some rumors about a broken AI but this is not true. If you get into a fight every enemy around takes cover and draw a weapon. I play on Hard difficulty not on Classic mode as I prefer the story over hardcore fights.

[b]Bugs[/b]
I had no crashes or game-breaking bugs encountered so far. Sometimes you see objects are not places correctly inside the environment (e.g. flying papers on a table or a person half inside the floor).",1601077687,1601077687,TRUE,1,0,0.523809552,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,80,25,1146,1146,300,1601555480

The remake is a bit shorter than the original but that doesn't change  anything the characters are really nice to see especially Paulie fuck i absolutely adore that guy a really funny lad the graphics are  amazing no one can be disappointed with that.

Fist fights are very basic (dodge once, then kill your opponent). 

There is just a lack of details in this game, similar to all the Mafia 1 vs. Mafia 3 comparisons we've seen (for example: Tommy suddenly turns lefthanded when he's peeking on the left side of cover, they just mirrored the animations I guess?).

89,Mafia Definitive Edition,76558459,english,"As a hardcore fan of the original as well as a fan of the 2nd and 3rd I have to say although the experience was enjoyable it did not deliver to my full expectations.

The feel and visuals of the game 9/10
Looks great, gun play is fun and challenging. My only gripes in this department are that the guns sounds and very weak IMO and that some of what the original arsenal was available is not in this game. Also with the switch blade and baseball bat still available, they somehow couldn't manage to make good melee animations for any of it. It just feels lack luster and wonky

Story 8/10
All the same missions are available and in the same order. The changes to the personalities of the characters are a bit jarring (Looking at you Sam and Paulie). Honestly Paulie's voice annoyed the shit out of me for about an hour but then it grew on me. The depth and calm nature of Tommy was a bit stripped as well but otherwise they're all pretty solid. Missions are a bit altered here and there for better and worse but ultimately it stayed true ENOUGH to the original for me to still enjoy it

Free ride and additional content 2/10
This is my biggest disappointment. I haven't played any of the missions in it yet but as far as what I saw about it online there's MAYBE 10 missions to complete hidden in the free ride mode, 5 of which are boosting cars, as well as the collectables that literally NOBODY would care about. I was REALLY hoping they would add all of the Free ride extreme challenges and maybe some additional side missions outside of Bertone's auto shop. 

Conclusion 6/10
As much as I did enjoy playing through the story, it truly felt like a half ass job. They came so close to knocking this out of the park but just fell short for me with the exclusion of a few pieces of story I was expecting to see as well as everything else I had previously mentioned. I in no way dislike this game and do recommend it. If you aren't as thirsty as I was to play the remake of the game that I personally view as a favorite of all time, I would recommend you wait for a sale. It lacks content and the story wraps up only after about 10 hours due to a lot of the driving being taken out of the missions.

However Hangar 13 have done a truly remarkable job here with this remake which has exceeded all expectations and put all concerns to rest. 

Firstly, the game is absolutely gorgeous with stunning visuals and an incredible amount of detail. The City of New Heaven looks so beautiful especially at night and the cars look phenomenal. The driving also feels spot-on. The movement, gunplay mechanics and animations aren't quite as polished but it's acceptable for the linear gameplay on offer. 

The game really shines just like the original with some sublime writing and truly outstanding voice performances. Dialogue and scenes have been rewritten and expanded upon and they've really brought it up to date. The motion capture and new character designs look fantastic and clearly a lot of work has gone into this aspect. 

Mafia Definitive Edition is a testament to the first game that should be enjoyed by all fans of original and newcomers of the series.

When I read all those people complaining about the race, well, go play gta or something.
Passed that one first try. Just be smart.

It feels a bit rushed though. Some scenery is looking damn amazing, especially nighttime and rain, then you got corners and places with washed out textures, streaming issues, especially in one part when you drive to a motel outside of the city. It all just looked so dated, blurry and washed out and the LOD was not really appropriate for this time. Not something that should happen in 2020 that much but well, see Serious Sam 4, its the same tragic story.

Overall the game plays a little more casual than the OG Mafia did. A lot more like Mafia 2.
I like the gunfeedback, even though ammo seems quite rare. There are some missions where you just shoot a group of enemys just to rush to the corpses and pickup the bullets just to then trigger the next enemy spawns. Feels a bit too much like forced action.

Overall I can recommend it though as of now, its not close to a 10/10, more like 6-6.5ish. Not sure how long it takes me to complete the story, but should be a bit left.

I just hope they fix some of the issues with texturestreaming and objectpopping. (no its not a hardwareissue as far as I can tell, but I'll take it back after the next driverupdate of nvidia)

I found the mission easy in the original, it wasn't too hard to master the controls unlike what some say, that, or I guess I just had a knack for it. Fair Play in this Remake though, if you want to beat it on Classic like I did, oh boy, have something to hit next to you, I've never been so angry at a game before. They made the mission impossibly hard, I don't know whether on purpose or just due to how stupid the AI is in the mission, you'll either get sucked into their car and spun out, or you'll be way in the lead and let's say the nearest car is 20 seconds behind you, yet all of a sudden that car will go mach speed and fly past you. I didn't have much of a problem with the AI besides that mission, but sometimes characters will take forever to hop into a vehicle, Sarah will randomly just stop moving, but that's it really. The driving is probably the best thing in the game (Apart from Fair Play) It feels so good, but maybe that's just because I'm used to turning the wheel left for a millisecond and immediately spinning out. The shooting feels great as well, it's similar to mafia 3 but a little bit harder, after all, Tommy is a cab driver, not a soldier.

/edit


I was really excited when this game was announced.
Then I realized it was made by Hangar 13, and it'd probably be an extension of mafia 3.
Then they showed the trailers and I noticed all the things I didn't like about mafia 3.
It still has the horrible blurry TAA effect that Mafia 3 had, the guns are still extremely inaccurate, and welcome to modern gaming's 2 weapon limit.

My biggest issue is the terrible TAA blur that we can't disable. I would like a patch to disable it, but I'm not holding my breath, considering Mafia 3 never got this, and H13 isn't exactly known for their game-fixing patches.

The original game was great, and while this one might be better from a story perspective, the actual game itself is everything I don't want modern games to be.
Hangar 13, give us options. If I wanted to be railroaded into using your specific blurry settings, I would have bought a console.",1601046978,1601065442,FALSE,4,0,0.475429177,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,1613,30,95,95,49,1601064632

I was waiting for this game since original Mafia: The City of Lost Heaven. It's out now. Overal from Youtube reviews it seems nice.

Older gamers from 2001 can confirm how the game catch us with details from second game level - ""Running Man"", there was  bunch of interesting detailes. So this Mafia just kill them all and it is just begining. I stop playing after an hour,  just because this game game lost all charm, details, characters from original one.

42,Mafia Definitive Edition,76555329,english,"I was 16 years old when the first Mafia came out and I've probably finished it about 10 times since then. Yes, I know people that have finished it 30 or more times. That's how important it was. So this remaster was going to either be a massive disappointment or........ Well, there really wasn't any other option. The original Mafia was practically perfect at the time, so how can you beat that?

Well, as it turns out you can.

After the messy Mafia II and III Definitive Editions, I was super sceptical of Hangar 13's ability to bring the original Mafia to the modern world and keep the magic from 2002 alive as well, but they have actually done it. I always adored the story and characters from the original game and this game managed to make those characters even more complex, more fleshed out and it gave more space to minor characters that deserved it. There is so much more personality in this game and the world feels more alive and the cutscenes convey a lot more emotion (obviously due to technological advancements) and at the same time, they've kept most of the original game mechanics intact to give it that old-school feel all the original fans wanted. this is simply the best way to enjoy the original Mafia game. And even if you don't like the original mechanics, just don't play on ""classic"" difficulty and you'll be enjoying a pretty good modern game.

If I had to nitpick a bit, I would be happier if some of the technical issues were a bit more polished, but considering the dumpster fire the other re-releases were, it's a freaking miracle this game even runs, let alone runs so well. It's actually very well optimized and my old GTX1080 can drive it easily in 2560x1440 in highest details above 60FPS, but I have to admit that there are things that could have been done better on the technical side, but I'll be brief as those alone don't make this a bad game. It's still a great game, but here's what could be added to make the game better - ADS toggle, resolution scaling, raytracing (although the lighting reflections here are amazing even without it), more flexible gamepad support (swapping between gamepad and mouse is a bit of a pain if you like to aim with a mouse and drive with a car), fewer bugs (nothing super major so far, just sometimes cutscenes stop working and you have to restart the game, the reflections often reflect just the character's legs, sometimes your allies get into a spastic seizure while they try to figure out which cover to choose and the save checkpoints will sometimes steal your better weapons)

Most of my Mafia playthroughs were with a Czech dubbing, which is very rare for me and I hate it pretty much everywhere else and I did try the English version too on a few of my playthroughs of the original game, but it just wasn't good enough. This was a Czech game and they made sure they hired good Czech actors. It wasn't perfect, far from it, but it really worked in its own strange way. Even the cringy parts were a positive, because it was just something to laugh at. So when I found out that this installment brings back most of the original cast for the Czech version, I just had to go with the Czech dubbing for nostalgia's sake and boy do I not regret that decision. It's less cringy, more professional, because those actors have 20 more years of experience and even though the main character is 30-40 years old, played by a 40 year old actor in the original, who came back to re-record his lines at 60 years old, it's just better than grabbing a new kid off the street and trying to make Tommy sound young. I love it. I hate Czech dubbing in general, but I adore it here.

The PC port works better than with Mafia 3, but in full screen the game feels like it's half of it's real FPS.
It doesn't support additional mouse buttons, and it's very Mafia 3. It has same problems with walking and customizing controls. But in this game they have put the button C which I usually like to use as a cover button for an unmappable ""take your melee weapon out"" button. It's not a big problem, but it's bringing the score down a tiny bit.

Game has great story and the story telling so far is magnificent. Even if you didn't like other Mafia games, you should give this a shot. One of the best crime games out there, none of the GTA games I have played are even closely fighting in a same ring.

They would deserve bit more oompf, even though they are not nearly as bad as in BFV. They sound like a weapons, but they don't sound super powerful.
-Graphics are really pretty. 
-This game has good driving, that feels better than L.A. Noire for example, as these cars are not modern. But you have way better brakes than what was even possible at the time unlike L.A. Noire.
-The hardest difficulty is punishing but fun. It's not impossible nor too easy like in some games.
-Gameplay feels very Mafia 3 too. Don't get me wrong, Tommy isn't some muscular giant, and he is worse shooter and worse runner and you can feel it. But there's a lot of recycled animations, which isn't too bad thing either. They are smooth and they work. But for those who absolutely hate everything about Mafia 3 which I don't understand, this has quite much similarities.
-This game has those OG NFS type ""drive here so you can disable cop or two"" kind of places which for me is a bit of a letdown. It helps the gameplay a lot so it's better for new players vs. the OG Mafia 1.
-Salieri's place is now more straight forward. You are also more directed to do what you are asked to do, so now you don't have to wonder where Vinny is located for the first time someone asks you to visit him.
-This game has more clear timeline than most games. It always tells you a year where that chapter takes a place in.


Other than the port being basically Mafia 3 with some improvements, I have nothing to complain about. It's a good game. I have enjoyed my time with it so far and I will continue to enjoy this game a lot in the very next hours. For me it's still little bit worse than Mafia 2 so far, but Tommy and everyone surrounding him are great characters. This game also feels more like a Mafia game than Mafia 2, but Mafia 2 has better port and amazing characters too and it's a classic too so maybe I'm just biased. I will update this when I get finish the game.

So far it's 8/10 as I finished I raise this to 9/10.

Is it as good as Mafia 2? In my opinion, it's very, very close second.
Mafia 2 has shops and just a little bit better characters, though the difference between mafia 2 and this game is like 1%. It just shows how amazing this game is. Incredible job!

So what's good?
Almost every single little thing. So it's easier to list cons.

-Port is still my least favourite thing.
-Some gun sounds are off, and in cutscenes they have better sounds, but in the end M1911 sounded more like a DMR in cutscenes rather than a pistol. It also butchered M1911, as it thinks that M1911 is a double action only pistol, similar to double action revolvers.

And that's basically it. It is such a masterpiece.",1601033621,1601062195,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,325,20,1106,1106,633,1601672501

It's a straight up remake that only tweaks a few things and makes some awkward stuff from 2002, like the overzealous police or the driving mechanics, optional. Nothing substantial is added and this preserves the flair and flow of the game almost perfectly. It's pure nostalgia.

For people who never played the original, this game might look a little bit lackluster. There's nothing to be found in the city outside of the main story missions. There are no side missions, random encounters or activities of any kind. None of the things that open world games introduced in the last 20 years are present. The city is only a backdrop for a very linear but very engaging story. 

The technical side is the most disappointing one. Even with every graphics option cranked to 11, the game looks like something from 4-5 years ago. G-sync can't prevent awful screen tearing, the frame rate is pretty unstable and the lighting looks dated and out of place a lot of the time, even in cutscenes.

91,Mafia Definitive Edition,76552194,english,"A remake of a masterpiece. I remember back in 2002, when I played the first game, I was completely sucked in by the story and the atmosphere. The second one was good, but I felt let down. Sure, there was no way to continue the story of the Salieri family, but Vito didn't really do it for me. 

It was actually back then, when the idea of a remake of the original, with new graphics and mechanics grew into our minds. When the third came up, I actually lost hope, only to be taken by surprise this summer, with the trailer for this definitive edition.

Now the game is here. Is it good? Is this what the fans have been asking for?
Pffff of course! It was a blast! This is a great way for the players that didn't play the original to be filled in on the story. It also has enough reworked moments, in order to satisfy the OG's. 

Speaking of that, even if you played the first game and you have a good idea of what to do, don't think the game won't surprise you. While keeping the core of the story intact, the missions got reworked enough and this will not be a walk in the park. Everything feels fresh and you are not quite sure what you are up against, even if you know the original missions.

Storywise,  there is much more dialogue now and some other scenes that will fill in the gaps left by the original. Where there were bits of story that were just presented by characters in conversations, now you get a bit more. 

[Minor spoiler section: I'm sorry, I need to give examples]

Where in the original, it was just suggested that Paulie was wasting his life on booze and girls, now you get to see that (kind of).
Where in the original it was suggested that Sarah was the perfect woman for Tommy, now you get to see that. Man, how I wished back in the day to get to see Tommy drive home to Sarah, from work. I'll tell you now that there is an element missing from the game, regarding the two, but you know what? I'm not bothered about it. Instead of some rushed scenes, with a damsel in distress, we now get a much more complete story for the two lovers. It was suggested in the original that she would be some sort of Karen Hill (for obvious reasons), but we never got to see that. We just had to imagine it. 

The story has some changes in the plot, that I wouldn't call minor. It's like the developers realized that the plot twist of the original was a bit weak, and they tried to change it a bit. You will have a surprise in the last part of the game. Also, there were some moments, mid game, that got me intrigued. I haven't finished the game yet, but I'm close and based on what I've wrote, I'm really curious of how the major characters will go through the final missions and what will be different this time around. 

Graphics: I really expected this to look great, but I've been hit by the reality of the industry (again). This has to run on PS4. If you've been spoiled by the latest triple A's out there, this won't look too special. Don't get me wrong, the game looks great, but I can't shake the feeling that it could've looked better. You notice this especially when driving through city. The game does not have ""Ultra"" option on graphic settings and sometimes you just get annoyed. It just looks basic.

There are a few minor glitches here and there, but nothing serious. In 11 hours of gameplay, I haven't experienced any major ones. 

Sound and atmosphere:

The original had a licence to use the music of Django Reinhardt and it was awesome. Now, that is missing, but what you get instead is not at all bad. Again, the game also makes use of orchestra music, to complete the atmosphere. 

As voices go, I would've loved to hear Michael Sorvino again, but we need to understand that actors, like all humans, move on.  The new actors do a great job, and the dialogue, significantly changed, feels fresh. I did have a problem in the beginning with some of the voices, but later in the game, the new characters grew on me. I still think that some of them rush through the lines a bit though, especially Don Salieri (who is...like...the least person you would expect to be stressed or hot-tempered). 

Buy it and enjoy it.  Whether you are new to the story, or an old fart who brags about playing it back in the day, this is a treat for everybody.

Had a lot of hype during the prerelease of this game cause my all time favourite series is this series so coming back to the original Mafia, was a dream come true.

While the game itself is great, the story is still fantastic and not all too different to the original, I just wished they dragged the game out a little longer and added more things to do. I know they did such with Sarah and some other missions/parts of the game, but I felt like this was a little too short.

Then I remembered they wanted to keep it as close to the original as possible so, so I understand that.

Outside of the story, there isn't much to do other than free ride which is just open world exploring and causing chaos and collecting cards and magazines. But I remember the original had let you do taxi missions or some stuff that felt like missions and where fun to do (forgive me if I'm wrong), but I felt like it had the potential to have more in free ride.

Some areas are glitched, and I have encountered some glitches in the open world generally too.

Up near the farm where you first save Sam, if you go a little further north to that small lake/creek or whatever, you see a floating tree, like it was left there to be placed onto the ground level but was never done.
Also around the same area, there is a building that is slightly clipped into the ground, which was also quite bothering to me but that's another small detail you can easily miss.
In the streets of LH, I saw a taxi glitch and do 7 cartwheels after clipping through 3 other vehicles that collided (spawn glitch?). And I also encountered this same annoying bug/glitch or just thing that keeps you basically locked into position if you don't look carefully - say you're driving casually with the speed limiter on so you can sink into the game better and enjoy the slow pacing, you drive by a tram that has a car next to it and of course you stop your car like any real person would do in that situation irl, and you wait patiently of what should be a couple seconds, but ends up to be eternity. If you're behind a car and next to one of those trams, both vehicles won't budge no matter what, and it's even worse if another car manages to stop behind you.

Other than the bugs/glitches I encountered, I really enjoyed what I played here, from start to finish. I'm glad to have played this game as soon as I could and I am happy to say that the game generally runs like a dream even on a midrange PC system.



Thank you all of the devs for putting your heart and soul into working on this project, even though there is glitches and bugs, I turn and look the other way, because I know this pandemic is hard on every single one of us out there.

Thanks to Hangar 13, I now know that wymminz were oppressed back in the day. Thanks for the ""supposed"" guilt trip. 

My view view on wymminz is completely changed. It takes balls to stand up for the MOST OPPRESSED MINORITY called wymminz in the year of 2020. Thank you for your feminist and western propaganda for western people.

30,Mafia Definitive Edition,76549772,english,"Mafia Definitive Edition is a ground up remake of the original and does look great when compared to the original.

That being said, you need to have Windows 10 and a decent GPU to take advantage of it.  ON high settings with all effects on, and High Detail textures set in your gpu with the best settings for visuals, you would need a RTX 2070 or higher to get good solid frame rates. As you decrease in GPU, you will simply adjust the GPU side, then game visuals to compensate. IT will still look great. While some turn off some effects, the game simply looks much more realistic with all them set to on. 

The story is fun and decent. Enough to keep you busy and difficulty can be greatly increased to provide a hard challenge. 

Glitches: Yes they exist. At times some are funny.  I noticed other vehicles caught up on telephone pole wires. Sometimes you will kill an enemy just on the other side of a barrier and they will glitch out once shot. Yet nothing to major.

Cussing is not over done like in some games. This is more real to life, especially in an Italian Family or Mafioso. The Don doesn't permit Cussing (Cursing) in the restaurant. This is an Italian thing, for those of us raised in such a family, your mouth was often quickly addressed with such language, especially in a strong Catholic family. I am glad it is full of lack of control potty mouth speech, even if their is some among the boys outside the restaurant.  A lot of foul language would certainly seem out of place in that situation and time period. 

The game is worth playing.  Note you need windows 10 as it is the minimal, while some can make it work on windows 8.1, certain Direct X 11 optimizations won't work.

47,Mafia Definitive Edition,76547721,english,"By using Mafia 3 as a baseline, they really ruined the game.

It has the same issues that Mafia 3 did, or the same design choices i dislike.

Gameplay problems, just to mention something i haven't seen most other people mention:
1: Getting Tommy to walk is a pain like in M3.
Your default state is ""jogging"". 
Press ""w"" and Tommy starts jogging. While jogging, press ""TAB"" to start walking. Now Tommy walks, UNTIL you release ""w"", the he's back to jogging again. It's infuriating that you have to toggle this constantly!

2: You drive like a racecar driver. Every time Tommy starts driving, it's pedal to the metal. Same deal as M3 again.
It's not so noticeable at first, but when you get faster vehicles, it is.

3: Honestly, EVERYTHING is fast. Tommy moves fast, he drives fast, animations are fast.
Which imo makes the game feel more like an action game than it should, compared to the original.

4: In the original if you where speeding, the cops would chase after you, pull you over and give you a ticket.
I tried to do the same here. 
I got pulled over, the cops ran over to me, got their gun out and pointet it at me, and then i was shown a ""Game over"" screen.
Uhh, what!?

Stuff like this really changes the ""feel"" of the game, compared to the original.


Technical issues:
1: The game is locked to 60Hz at first. This can be removed by going to the .exe, and disable fullscreen optimizations.
This solves the issue, but doesn't lock the mousecursor to the screen, until the game has started and you have ALT+TAB out of the game once. Exactly the same as M3.

76,Mafia Definitive Edition,76545022,english,"Unfortunately, I can't say that I am happy with this game.

While there are many new positives and it was truly refreshing to revisit a game I consider to be a very dear old friend, Mafia : Definitive Edition did not add much that Mafia II Definitive Edition didn't already bring to the table. In fact, I stand firmly on the fact that Mafia : II still brings more to the table than Mafia 3 or Mafia : Definitive Edition ever will.

There are some bugs and glitches, but these are forgivable as the game just released and it's likely it will need patchwork to fix those issues. Like floating weapons on Sam during certain missions and such.

The city is beautiful but that's about it. There is still a very big lack of interactivity and you can mostly just drive around the city listening to the radio, but find nothing to actually do. You can't play poker, can't sell bootleg cigarettes or booze, can't interact with the world around you and I feel like that was a heavily missed opportunity that could have brought some extra life into Mafia : Definitive Edition. I can't help but feel like gameinformer's review explains it all as follows : 

""Ultimately, it’s difficult to shake the very real feeling that you’re playing a relic from a bygone era. There are some set-piece moments, such as busting down a warehouse door with a rail car or escaping an abandoned prison, but the thrills that they may have once offered are brought down by the subpar gameplay you’re stuck with once the smoke clears. The worst examples are the times when you’re forced into stealth sequences. There are only a few of these sections, thankfully, but the “raise the alarm means game over” failure stakes make them more about frustration than in building tension.

The original Mafia was well-received at its release, and I’m sure a lot of people remember it fondly. For me, it’s something that’s probably best seen as a foundational statement in a series that got better over time and subsequent entries. As part of the Mafia trilogy, it’s an interesting footnote on what came before. As a standalone game that can hold its own against modern titles in the open-world genre? Fugetaboutit.""

Loyal to a fault, indeed.

The voice acting is terrible. Tommy has one of the WORST italian accents I've ever heard and considering I come from a family of italian immigrants who came to NY in the 20's, I think I can tell a decently played accent versus someone with a real italian clip to their voice. Everything Tommy says feels very forced.

Cars - when they crash into things, there's little damage to your car that makes sense. Example, during the race mission I hit a wall a few times trying to figure the controls out but the damage to my car from a head-on collision wasn't even visible save a few scratches to the body with smoke billowing from the engine in increasingly thicker clouds each time until the engine fails and then you get the ""game over"" screen. Even driving around the city doesn't show appropriate car damages if you crash, hit another car, or a pole. Just really bad environmental interactivity.

There is nothing to do between missions and free ride mode is a snoozefest.

You get two radio stations. Two. All of which have a little over 30 songs played by the same artist. So I hope you like Duke Ellington. Because that's all you're going to hear. Pending you get lucky and catch any of the Cab Calloway, Django Reinhardt, or the one song from the High Hatters, Mildred Bailey, and Louis Armstrong plays. It sounds like there's variety but more than 15 of the 30 songs on this game are played by Duke Ellington. 

Unless you're one of Duke's biggest fans, this made the experience repetitive. If I have to hear ""Creole Love call"" one more time, I might just wack myself lol.

Hangar 13 provided a visually stunning piece of nostalgia. But that's it. That's all I can say about this game so far and my current experience isn't enough to get me to be excited about finishing the game. I actually think I've played my fill already....and I've only played 3.9 hours.

Not the return I was hoping for. Sorry Hangar 13, but you missed the mark entirely and can't fool this fan of the franchise with pretty graphics and a sense of nostalgia.

I can't say that this game will be much of a talking point and if anyone asks about it, I will be less likely to suggest buying it at the current asking price.

94,Mafia Definitive Edition,76537020,english,"[h1]Introduction[/h1]
I played and l loved the orginal MAFIA and like everyone else who did I soon had to accept that this indeed a new game and not a an exact copy of the original with simply improved graphics. 


[hr][/hr]
[h1]Remake or Remaster?[/h1]
The game was remade from scratch with a new engine (the same that was used for MAFIA III) and can be described conventionally as a ""remake"". That's what it is and that's how it is advertised. A ""remake"" and NO ""remaster"" (which I would describe as the same game with better graphics even though most modern remasters tend to be limited to simply some minor improved textures and updated aspect ratio). 
Personally I think it's quite hard to classify the game in of the two categories since it has characteristics of both. 


On the one hand the remake's gameplay got major adjustments compared to the 2002 original - mostly to make it more casual and feel less realistic but more arcadey to please a new audience. This would classify it as ""remake"" since those changes are made to update the gameplay to modern standards:

[u][b]Gunplay[/b][/u]
Unlike the orignal this game has a cover system while shooting which makes sense since leaving it out would have felt outdated, no doubt. A third person shooter without a cover system won't work anymore nowadays. 
Shooting now feels less satisfying especially since enemies don't really react to taking multiple shots to their bodies - until they're dead. Revolver shots now can be spammed without a delay for re-cocking which again seems like a adjustment to make it more casual. Recoil seems less punishing now and ammo isn't really limited anymore since there are many ammo pickups gathered around the levels (even on ""classic"" difficulty, later more to this topic.) The animations of shooting and reloading seem to be recycled from MAFIA III which I don't like that much to be honest. While Hangar 13 talked about how they had to make Tommy who's just a cabdriver feel different to Lincoln Clay who is a trained soldier, they still use the same animations and show Tommy shooting every pistol with one hand and reloading his revolver in a split second while spinning the chamber and doing gun spinning tricks. The gunplay in general feels way more action-packed and ""Rambo""-like now. For example you will now find red explosive barrels gathered around in the gunfight scenarios - pretty much like in any other modern shooter.
It is still possible to shoot your pistol while driving, but the game now automatically locks onto enemy cars unlike to the original where you could aim freely. The times where you had to aim precisely for the tires to make a car stop are gone. Now you shoot the car's body so long until it explodes. They even added ramming triggered by a simple button as a new arcadey car combat feature, which it a nice transition to the next aspect.

[u][b]Driving[/b][/u]
The driving feels quite good, but again different. I'm playing on ""Simulation""-mode which apparently makes driving feel more realistic, though I wouldn't call it so. The driving feels massive, the car physics tend to be a little bit too ""drifty"" for my taste and even cutting corners with low speed makes your tires screech. Those who played MAFIA III know what I'm talking about.


While it seems like Hangar 13 tried to update the game mechanics to modern games (therfore making a remake), they still didn't feel like adding content to the massive open-world and its city Lost Heaven which on the other hand feels like they couldn't decide wether a remaster would be the better choice.

[u][b]The world[/b][/u]
The MAFIA series was always rather pseudo open world with a linear story but remaking Lost Heaven with so many details and then leaving out usable trams seems odd to me. I didn't expect them to add much freeroam content like random encounters that GTA V has for example but they at least could have added some small diners and clothing shops like 2K Czech did with MAFIA II. It just seems like wasted potential here to me. A massive and gorgeous city that just seems like means for the purpose.


[hr][/hr]
[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
Obviously the main target group of this game is not the nostalgic fanboys who expect the 2002 orginal with better graphics and the same clunky but more realistic approach to shooting and driving, but rather new players who expect basically a sequel to MAFIA III which recycles the original game's world, its story and characters. 

If you had no problem with MAFIA III's gunplay and driving physics you neither will have with this game. It still is a great story and I really like how Hangar 13 fleshed out the story in some parts. There are some minor decisions that I cannot understand like [spoiler] justifying the 'molotov party' as Tommy's will going for revenge after Morello's mobsters damaged his cab. The original made it clear that this was basically Salieri testing him if he suits the mafia lifeystyle while Tommy felt forced to join the family since he needed Salieri's protection. He couldn't return to his cabdriver profession as Morello's guys would go after him again. [/spoiler]

But all in all I think it is a really nice refreshing trip of nostalgia playing the game. If you didn't play the original it will probably be an even better experience in my opinion.",1601043012,1601050865,TRUE,3,0,0.557430148,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,391,8,967,967,121,1601844514

But then we got to the first mission. The game starts with a car chase when you first gain control.  I had problems with my controller so I did nothing for a while, nothing bad came of that despite me standing still for like 10 seconds. After that I turn a corner and trigger a scripted event that ends the chase.

Later on I have to perform more scripted event chase endings. You also press F to ram someone in a car?

The world is beautiful and the countryside is breathtaking.
As a guy who played the original 15 times my only problems are the fact that you cannot use the trains and the combat could've been a bit better but that doesn't hold this game from being a well done remake. I also hope they will expand the game with updates because it's a shame to  let that beautiful world without activities. All in all: GG Hangar 13!

Borderless window mode improves framerate but does not alleviate the game breaking stutters and also isn't smooth gameplay even with high FPS. It also will not detect maximum refresh rate in fullscreen mode forcing you to run in 60hz.

The world seems small on the map, but since travel time is so long due to 30’s car aren’t that fast, it’s bigger than it seems.  The car themselves are really fun and good to drive. Imagine how a 30’s car would drive, that’s how they are in the game, with all the sounds included.
While driving around you also get quite immersed into the world, it does feel lived into. There is a lot of NPC’s wondering about in the world. But the layout of everything just seems right for some reason and can’t put my finger on what it exactly is.

Downsides, this first build had made the game freeze up 2 times when i Alt TAB or wanted to look at my other monitor. The game seems to be well optimized it does not use a lot of resources, but sometimes i do get frame drops. So some fine-tuning needs to be done.

Having played all the Mafia games since the authentic 2002 Mafia 1, I have to say the overall gaming experience for this game is pretty good and it feels good after going through 4 missions which they call chapters.

I really really like the decision they made and the idea to do a remake of the original masterpiece. The overall execution feels solid and I think they did a good job. However I have to say that the original still feels more complete, more in depth, more complex than this new edition, which I can only describe as being visually stunning.

I highly recommend it, if you are hesitating.

Visually this game is well done and well executed. They did a really good job at communicating the style of this era, with the right clothing, the right cars and so on. The overall game feels really really immersive. The cutscenes are beautiful and they back the story well. I really enjoy the main menu ""decor and ambiance"", it's a nice touch.

THE DRIVING:

This feels much better than Mafia 3. The cars feel heavy, they turn like I expect them to turn and overall this is well executed. I also prefer the UI while driving with just the right speed dial instead of the big bottom bar of Mafia 3.

THE INVENTORY UI:

This is also a nice new element. Instead of scrolling with your mouse wheels to get to a certain weapon or item, you just hold down your mouse wheel and you have a quick dial menu (like Saints Row) to choose what you want.

THE SOUND:

The weapons, the explosions, the cars, they all sound to the point. The radio station(s) I will have to check this one (I think there is only one for now) feels really good and it also adds to convey the era while driving through the city.

--- CONS ---

IT FEELS RUSHED ON EVERYTHING ELSE: 

This will be a big disappointment for many but this game feels rushed for the rest. For example, in a certain mission, you have to do something at a certain place and when you get there and you're finished with your task, the mission ends there, there is no driving back, there is no continuation for what happened there. The story fells shorts on a lot of areas like this one and it breaks the story and immersiveness. It really feels as if they wanted to get the game out as soon as possible to benefit of the covid situation instead of extending the game's development cycle.

NO PAUSE BETWEEN MISSIONS:

This feels like Mafia 2 as if they didn't learn from their mistakes for this point and at what we already said before. You go from mission to mission like a workhorse without taking a break and having the choice to choose to continue the story or not like in GTA. Maybe they choose to do it like this, but I must not be the only one complaining about this. 

AN OPEN WORLD THAT IS NOT MEANT TO BE EXPLORED:

This feels weird to write but this feels like a linear game in an open world. I don't know how to explain it better. The only real advantage of it being an ""open"" world is while your driving, you can go where you want and that's about it. They did not take advantage of the open world like the GTA's. There is no time to explore the environments.

NO ECONOMY, NOTHING TO PURCHASE OUTSIDE OF MISSIONS:

There is no economy and money mechanism to purchase things. There is nothing to purchase or do outside the missions. This would have been a really nice addition to the game and make it more competitive against the GTA's, to add gameplay, prolong the game's life for the players and reinforce the place and the meaning of the Mafia series in the current landscape of the gaming marketplace. I have to say this is really sad because I would have like to have the ability to do so, like in GTA. I understand this game is not GTA but it's still an open-world and I don't get why they haven't though it out better at this level. After the first missions you think to yourself maybe it's just not yet available in the beggning, I have to wait to be further in the game, but after a while you realize this is it and it was just not tought out or planned in the making.

THE POLICE A.I: 

I play the game on the hardest difficulty of the 4 availables, which is classic. When you're driving on the wrong side of the road and passing a police car, nothing happens, just like it's normal behavior. I don't know how hard this would be to actually implement, but it would have felt much better.

THE MELEE COMBAT DODGE MECHANISM: 

While in hand to hand combat, you now have the ability to dodge. This new ability is really overpowered as you just have to press ALT to dodge every single punch or melee attack thrown at you.

THE VEHICULES DODGE MECHANISM DURING PURSUITS:

This new mechanism also feels overpowered. Basically, you have the option to go through construction sites or zones while driving to lose your opponents, putting an end to 1 car chasing meaning if you have 4 cars chasing you, you have to go thourgh 4 of these zones. They all have a cutscene which adds to the pursuits, but I would have preferred the normal way of just cutting through backstreets and so on rather than having this mechanism.

BUGS:

KEY BINDINGS ON PC:

One of the bugs I encountered was with the UI telling me to press A to do a certain action when in reality the key was Q. The keys being shown in the interface don't match the really keys on the keyboard for some reasons.

THE VEHICULES HEIGHT RELATIVE TO THE ROAD:

One other bug I encounted was outside of town with a truck not sticking to the road while driving, with it's right wheels floating 2-3 feets above the ground.

41,Mafia Definitive Edition,76539219,english,"Mafia is an excellent remake, The game is playing around 90 to 100 FPS for me on my machine. The story is how i remember but they take on new little twists and turns that really flesh out what the original developers didn't have time to finish off. 

I haven't had any crashes or PC lockups yet, some of the animations are a little janky when jumping over stuff, it seems to be the one place where it looks weird compared to the rest of the game. The driving has been much improved from the original which is nice, but the Race missions was still a challenge to beat on classic mode. 

Maybe nostalgia is powering me on too, but i remember playing this on my dad's PC when i was 10 or 11 and just being taken back to that moment in time but with visuals from this generation is fueling my nostalgia boner. 

Also, like that they priced it at £35, any more would have probably felt greedy, they also improved some of the stuff that sucked in mafia 3. I hope that's due to taking the criticism on board last time and not that it's because they had an amazing story already set up. The Motion capture and voices and everything is really well done, Hanger 13 can do cut scenes ill give them that. 

I would recommend anyone who buys this game to play it on the difficulty classic mode, especially if you played the original in 2002. If you struggle in some parts you can always change the difficulty to get past a difficult bit, but make sure to switch it back to classic. I cannot recommend that difficulty enough.

Mafia: Definitive Edition is a remake that feels like a completely new game based on original one. It took the best aspects from the controversial Mafia III and mixed those with a story from original Mafia. 

The game looks great and technical aspects are impressive, especially cutscenes. Shooting is close to what we saw in Mafia III with some more oldschool tweaks. Also, there's a ""Classic"" difficulty setting that is much closer to the original game.

I remember the original game quite well and there's plenty of minor but important changes to characters and story, so overall impression/emotions after some scenes are different. Not particularly worse, but different. With that in mind Mafia: Definitive Edition can't completely replace the original game if you want to experience it again or if you never played it and want to try this classic. But it's still a great standalone game that would be appealing to people who never played original as well as to people who played the original game bringing them a lot of nostalgic memories and providing a new look for familiar situations.

I had big doubts about whether this remake can actually reach the same level of Mafia I based on how Hangar 13 performed with Mafia III. All of those doubts are clear - the game is an amazing tribute to the original Mafia. Basically, it's a scene by scene remake with more polished dialogues and expanded character motivations that greatly improve the plot. It is improved in every single way - graphically, gameplay-wise, actor performance, sounds design. It's also very optimized, runs smoothly on a mid-level rig, no crashes encountered. I probably completed 1/3 of the game and I'm having a blast of fun and nostalgia. Sure, there are some minor changes, like music (still awesome), no free ride extreme (or maybe I haven't unlocked it yet?), but the game is definitely worth buying.

But lets just bring in the pros and con shall we.

The good
-Graphics are gorgeous 
-The cut scenes look great with the whole facial expression on some characters
-The music have been reworked and sounds wonderful especially the orchestra scores
-They have multiple difficulty choices and you can choose the classic one or anything on the go but for people who bought the game they have the chance of playing the old classic mode
-Combat mechanic like hand to hand and executions have been put in the game
-Cops are back arresting you for speeding,bumping into others or other offensives unlike mafia 3 where they were just there.
-Driving on simulation is hard but fun.
-The optimization is good but I do get some micro stutters

Now the bad
-What is up with the movement of tommy ? He looks like he shat his pants while he's running...hell they're still reusing the same movement from Lincoln from god damn Mafia 3
-The combat for both hand to hand and guns are just bad. You don't feel the impact when you punch people or hit them with a bat like you should it feels like you're punching giant pillows who are just waiting for you to punch them to death.
-The gun play is lacking and boring it has none of the impact like it should and the way he holds the gun makes me wonder what the hell they were thinking. In the original game he was holding guns with  2 hands and took his time to reload meanwhile Tommy in this game holds it with 1 hand and just blows the ammo in the gun like he's a quick draw yet the devs said he's not a ""combat vet like Lincoln is"" during a youtube video.....someone please tell these guys that people usually hold guns with 2 hands unless they're some gang banger acting tough.
-Why does he run around with a shotgun,tommy gun,rifle with 1 hand like they weigh like balloons or something ? The guys back in the days put more detail in the gunplay and how people hold guns then hanger 13 did.
-Half the animation on Tommy is from Lincoln so they just pretty much reused the animation from Mafia 3 and some scenary too like the alley ways and buildings.
-Paulie is a douch to Ralph and his laugh is annoying instead of liking him I hate him unlike Paulie from the original game.
-The microstutters in the game is just annoying for some reason at certain point of the game it just stops for 5 seconds then come back
-Graphical issue on the cars while you drive. I was driving Sam and paulie to China Town and all of a sudden the car disappeared but we were in the car seated driving an invisible car it seems till it came back.
-The race mission is worse in this game than the original one it's just annoying as shit here
-For some reason the game doesn't show up in your timeline as if you are playing it even though you are
-Sometimes the game is just broken at some parts of the map like in the city where I lost pretty much my fps from 60 fps to 20 it only got fixed when I got out of the place.
-No preload for pc players seriously you monkeys gave console players pre load while making us wait longer.

All in all the game is ok and does some justice to 13 hangers disastrous start with Mafia 3 but at the same time they haven't done much to improve themselves instead of making new animations and remaking the game they just reused the assets of the old game.

71,Mafia Definitive Edition,76535825,english,"I really like it. The atmosphere is still there and it's even enhanced by the amazing graphics, the story line has many gaps filled in which I think it shows they really took this remake seriously.

I completed Mafia 1 many many times and it's very enjoyable to play this better version imo.

The only downside is that there are a few things that need polishing, rag doll physics, AI is a bit dumb, and not a fan of always visible objective markers that ruin immersion imo (I hope we can turn these on and off).

All in all, I think it's the best remake I've ever experienced, and I think it was a very hard recipe to pull off: be new enough to be bought but true enough to the old game so it doesn't upset fans, but I think they pulled it off very nicely, and I think the price is fair.

So if you're a Mafia fan, buy this right away, you won't be disappointed.

Pros: 

1. Cover Based system: In the original it was extremely difficult to play the game and not able to take cover from enemy fire.

2. Graphics Overhaul: Compared to 2002 this game looks stunningly beautiful Its nice to see Lost Heaven in HD and updated Graphics. The characters, the scenery, the cars, and the city looks amazing.

3. Updated and expanded on script: I know people may have mixed feelings on this, as I do myself, but I personally think they did well on expanding dialog and the story just by changing some simple lines, and adding a few.

4. Humor: The humor in the game can be very amusing at times, its rare but its still amusing, one that I personally thought was funny was a joke that was inspired off of the ""Funny Like How?"" scene in Goodfella's only in a completely unique and original way, but you can see it was inspired off of that scene.

5. Well optimized performance: The game runs very smooth its well optimized, no issues with the graphics, I haven't come across any bugs at the moment, will update if there is any worth mentioning.

Cons:

1. SOME of the voice acting: Some of the voice acting is confusing and awkward at times mainly when you are in your car with Paulie and Sam, they sound like they were voiced by the same person (and sort of look like twins) the simple way around it is to have subtitles on. In the 2002 version Paulie sounded older like late 30's/early 40's as well as looked older in the classic, and Sam sounded more or less the same age as Tommy (which was early 30's). In this one Tommy sounds like he is in his 40's or 50's the entire time, It does get awkward at times hearing Tommy talk around Paulie and Sam because he sounds like he's old enough to be their dad. Its a massive change from the classic, one you will eventually get used to.

2. Cutting of the ending monologue: I have mixed feelings about this, in the classic there was a great ending dialog that still to this day remains one of my favorite speeches, however, how it was replaced seemed fitting and bittersweet compared to the original, overall I have mixed feelings on this, more good then bad because of how much the ending speech effected me when I first played the original back in 02, its different, but also something I can get used to.

4,Mafia Definitive Edition,76532492,english,"This is definitely for fans of the original -- having these high quality graphics with great facial animation feels like a legitimately exhilarating way to re-experience Mafia. The acting is also very good quality for the most part, and it really brings the storytelling to an entire other level. Replaying the original missions with modernized gameplay and sensible changes to where the original was more RNG based (thinking about chases in particular) is great, and after playing the first set of missions I have to say that I get all these deep nostalgic feelings while playing that I haven't gotten from other remakes. I strongly connected emotionally with the original Mafia, so if that's true for you too you might get the same tingles of joy from even the most simple things in this.

I did try to replay the original back when the definitive edition was announced, and while I still love the game to death, it's difficulty to play by current standards. A big part of that is because it took a more sim approach and was working off a military simulator engine (from Hidden & Dangerous). With the updated Mafia mechanics from the sequels, the excellent story that made the game stand out and become well-loved by its fans can really take front-stage while the gameplay serves to enhance it rather than being often a source of frustration.

And you can still put it on those more difficult simulator-type settings! This is one thing I was worried about. A big part of what made the original appeal to me was the realism, so being able to have cops react in similar ways to the original (though with better AI) and have the combat still be a struggle to live is very important to me. They have a ""Classic"" difficulty that so far has really brought back the feeling of really being in the world that the first game accomplished.

You can tell the team really put their heart into this and wanted to deliver for long-time fans while also presenting this magnificent story experience to modern players who didn't have the chance to play through the original all those years ago.

I can't wait to play through the rest of this. I haven't been this excited by playing a game, well... since Doom Eternal, but if Doom Eternal didn't exist I'd have to say it's been several years. People who were worried about Hangar 13 (who actually is made up of devs from the first games anyways) ruining the game because of a bad experience with Mafia 3 can be put at ease: this game has the traditional mission structure of the first game and the resources weren't laid too thin this time.

The characters feel completely different (not necessarily worse, just different), the missions are much more linear with strict objectives to follow and not much room for creativity. The story and cutscenes are much more 'in your face', lacking the subtlety and cinematic feel of the original. 
Do yourself a favor and play the original, either before or after playing this. The story is mostly the same, but the characters and pacing make all the difference.

From the technical side, there's not much to complain about. The performance is great, runs perfectly on a 1070 with everything on high.

My expectations were not only just met, it all went above and beyond!
As a veteran player of the 2002 version, I got goosebumps flooding my skin from the first second I started off the entry cutscene, the amount of details they put in this new version it's just amazing. Walking on the ""new"" streets of Lost Heaven is so immersive, it feels like I time-traveled in the 1930's.
I like the fact that both the story and the city are not just copy/pasted from the original, instead you can feel creativity.
The way cars are driven in ""original"" mode feels right (I was afraid the Mafia III mechanics will be used).
I also cruised a bike and that felt properly fitted as well. As a new feature i was curious to give it a try and I was not disappointed. Job well done on that.
Although the choice of music is correct, I am still missing the original songs.
The only downside I've had so far (by the time I'm writing the review I reached the race mission) is the lack of monitor refresh rate setting (can be fixed by putting it in borderless though, but you'd expect from an AAA to have it by default in the settings menu).

It's a nice getaway game if you like nostalgia too.Brilliant music & old cars!

Back to 1930

It's much better than Mafia 3 that's for sure.
Driving is also fun but not as difficult as Mafia 2 (I would prefer Mafia 2 driving.) Manual shifting is a nice touch aswell.
Bike riding is so much fun!! Got my first ticket in the game riding a bike for the first time lol.

+Graphics
+Free Ride mode is a great addition.
+Ragdolling NPCs
+Cars & Music
+Bikes
+Police can fine you for running at red light & speeding!

-NO PHOTO MODE at the time of release :(

Love the game overall!

Also, in the end when Vito and Joe killed Tommy, Tommy was surprised attacked but in the new game he was peacefully standing on the lawn waitting for them to shot after they called him in his true name.

Mafia original story ++ =) 
Graphics = amazing .. and it even runs well maxed out on my 1080ti 1440p never going under 60 fps ( though one mission had some stutter )
Sound = amazing
Voice acting = amazing and well done 

Now to the bad. Weapons did take a step back .. tommy gun has only 50 rounds and not 100 or 150 .. this feels just bad and wrong when you see the big drum magazin, on top of that its pretty limited on how many weapons you can have .. only 1 pistol and one big gun .. thats it ..
Driving has greatly improved but i think they could have done a bit more

The atmosphere is really simmilar to the original Mafia, soundtrack is pretty good, there are some tunes i didnt especially liked (race music, i’d even prefere to drive in quiet).

Controls are decent, car movement very nice, shooting nice and easy. 

There are some bugs, sometimes it takes a second for textures to load but in general all is good.

Faces are bland, like stones, animations sometimes do not exist (noticed few times that Paulie just stares at one point without slightest movement), many npc just stand and wait for you to pass, without word, without any emotion on their faces. Same issue with Tommy, many times his face looks like a rock. 

Besides cons, games is pretty faithful to the original, for sure its worth to purchase it if you never played original mafia, if you are the fan of the og game, you should especially purchase it.

Optimisation is decent, noticed some drops but never under 70 fps on max settings. 80% of the time I have around 100 fps.

47,Mafia Definitive Edition,76511419,english,"Already played a little bit until the ending of the first chapter and also tried out the free ride mode to get an idea on what the overall experience will be like. Upfront I cant say that there are definitely some issues that bother me about the remake and I want to showcase them in detail.

One big gripe I have with the game are those new cinematic ways to destroy cars that follow you. They feel too scripted and look really silly at times while not adding anything interesting to the game. The just exist and are more likely to hinder your driving because the animation really hinders your momentum.

Secondly, the missing destruction of cars. The older version already had an astonishing detail of destructibility which was also used during some early mission. However, in the remake it's just missing and it looks and feels really awkward to crash your vehicle. It just feels like something is missing when you are driving extremely fast and suddenly just bounce of a wall like a ball.

Lastly the giant crosshair if you could even call it that. It just this menacing dot that is placed in the center of your screen. I really don't like they way it looks and it can be really distracting at times. This is especially annoying because the shooting actually feels decent and plays really well on Classic difficulty. I haven't tried out the Tommy gun yet but the handguns I used felt nice even though the could still up the recoil a little bit. 

Not really a criticism but certainly a disappointment is that the iconic numbered health bar doesn't make it's return. It's just a part of Mafia I. Furthermore the awkward silence when meeting characters in free ride mode. The just stand there and don't even react to Tommy. Could also be an early bug because they are actually shown on the map and at least look interactable.

However, even after these assessments I still think that Hangar 13 did a really good job at remaking that game for a new audience while still being faithful to old fans / the original. Yes, there are problems and gripes I and many other fans have / will have with the game but I still think that it's a remake worthy of the original. 

To people who might read this and ask themselves if you really can form an opinion on a game after nearly on hour, I can only say that with a story-game-remake like Mafia you can certainly judge the quality even after little playtime because I truly don't think that they messed up the story / characters.

- the voice acting now. I thought I was gonna have issues with not even the original voice actor for Tommy not being cast but after the Molotov mission i liked it. Sam and Paulie, Frank, Vinnie, Ralp, Lucas are good to and I really appreciate the new voice for Don Salieri. Way better than the original.

It isn't GTA and it isn't going to let you go to a strip club in between blowing away rival mobs, it's here to tell a story, and if you're interested in hearing a good one set in the prohibition era New York it'll hit those boxes and then some in (at times) stunning visuals.

Mafia 1 was one of my favorite games back in the day, and Mafia 3 was a disaster for me (looked good, good story when it was there, but nothing MAFIA and the missions were horrible and boring).

So this game, it actually stays true to the original, some characters have been changed a bit like Tommy, Paulie and Vincenzo, but it is not bad by any means, just different.

The city looks amazing, every thing feels more alive, the characters, the city, the streets, the cars. Everything just feels right.

Some things I did not like were some of the animations, like throwing a molotov etc, its just awkward, as wel as jumping down ledges etc looks just goofy.

One big change they've made is that the city and country side are now a seamless transition, although it may not look like much, it adds so much.
I've also read that some people are having problems with the graphics or the download itself. So beware about that.
I have had no problems other than the mouse being pretty jittery, but the frame rate is a constant 60fps (I locked it there).",1600996575,1600996575,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,469,29,1095,1095,90,1601313555

After seeing HDR and 4K mentioned a lot in marketing material for the game I was surprised to learn that this feature is completely missing on PC. Doesn't matter if I have HDR enabled in Windows or not, neither the launcher nor the game settings have any option to enable it and there is clearly no high dynamic range output.

The PS 4 Pro version in contrast definitive has proper HDR output:

I am using a Geforce 2080 connected to a LG CX 48"" OLED TV so there is no hardware limitation at play. All other HDR enabled PC games I own like CoD, Madden, BF5, latest Tomb Raider, latest Ori, iRacing all work perfectly fine in HDR on my setup.

BTW, for some reason HDR was exclusive for the XBox One X for Mafia III DE:
