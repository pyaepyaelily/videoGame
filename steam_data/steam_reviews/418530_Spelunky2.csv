If I take my time to find a way to not bomb every dead-end I encounter and get money for shop items, then the ghost appears -- which for some reason causes him to split into two respectively-faster ghosts and then I lose all my progress.

Why are there so many enemies and so many traps? It makes it frustrating to get through these levels without being hit by some cheap garbage caused by level generation.

8,77058105,english,"As a longtime player of Spelunky 1 (have over 500 hours clocked here on Steam and on PS4), this is an excellent sequel. The movement is almost identical to Spelunky 1 (feels like buttah!) but the maps and hitboxes have become slightly more difficult. The whip is a bit shorter and you cannot whip things underneath you anymore. More realistic, but difficult elements to the game have been added; the shotgun recoil, for example, is no longer stopped by being on a rope or ladder. While initially frustrating, I grew to appreciate the added and fair difficulty. Obviously visuals and audio have been greatly upgraded and the result is very slick. I also appreciate the amusing NPC/enemy interactions and animations they've added.

Another thing I noticed and I appreciate, though I am not a newbie for which these changes are intended, is the sneaky new level design that encourages you to do some of the moves/interactions that were not directly taught in the first one. For example, hanging off ledges to break falls is one strategy used in high level Spelunky 1 playing that was not explicitly encouraged by the level design. In Spelunky 2 it is explicitly taught in the tutorial and I noticed several types of level sections with aligned vertical drops, presumably designed to get you to do that. Similarly, while some new traps were thrown in abruptly in Speulunky 1 (like the totems), I noticed that now they subtly get you used to them by first placing large ones triggered at a distance from farther a way and slowly replace them with more modest traps that are less visible, trigger only while on top of them, and take off more HP. Additionally they place the totem traps somewhat near (but not right next to) the exit, likely to get you used to getting close to them (I remember being super scared of them in Spelunky 1 and didn't realize I could slip right by them if they were right next to the exit until many many hours later). I see what you're doing Derek! ;) :spelunky: :cuteghost:

Only negatives I have are the difference in difficulty between the second level choices (which many have suggested) and the lack of choice in toggle/hold for some of the items. I'm guessing hold is better for newer players (I remember thinking the climbing gloves in Spelunky 1 didn't make sense but got used to it--now I'm frantically trying to unlearn Spelunky 1's climbing controls). However the more difficult level is not impossible--I now get through it with ease.

Also, returning players should note that if you initially played this game on a different platform, it will take longer to get used to. I play 90% of the time on PC and I first played Spelunky 2 on PS4 which was way more difficult. The second I used the PC, my skills improved exponentially--this is likely due to the difference in controller and sitting distance.

TLDR: Spelunky and Spelunky 2 are the Dark Souls of platforming. (Yes I know its a cliche.) While newbies might be frustrated, go in with the knowledge that there are ton of secrets waiting to be revealed--that pushed me through it and eventually I ended up liking the original game a lot despite not normally being a fan of twitchy/precision platforming games. The game legitimately makes you cheer when you get to a new area or unlock a new secret.

19,77054389,english,"wow, this is a phenomenal game
ok, so after writing a few reviews i learned that it REALLY isn't for me but this game is so amazing that i'd feel like i'm doing it a disservice by not reviewing it.

when i first played spelunky, i failed, i triumphed, i learned, but most importantly; i died, a lot. the thing about spelunky is that it does not hold anything back, and i was not dissapointed to learn that the sequel is very much the same, but even harder. this game can manage an incredible balance between being extremely difficult and yet fair. through my hours of playing and countless deaths, maybe once or twice i felt like a death wasnt entirely my fault. enough with the basic overview, let's see what's changed

changes for the worse

i don't want to end this review on a sour note, so we'll get the things i didn't like about this game out of the way first.
first of all, the music.
spelunky 2 expands on nearly every single thing that spelunky 1 put on the table, more enemies, more areas, and many more ways to find yourself dead. the only thing that it didnt expand on was the music. the first game had maybe 4 tracks per area that would each have a random chance of playing so you dont have to listen to the same song every time you die. i think this is a great thing, and i was slightly dissapointed to see that it didn't appear in the sequel. the music is still wonderful, don't get me wrong, and maybe it's a little nitpicky, but i don't really know the reason for this change.
second of all, the lag.
this game is beautiful. the effects that appear are amazing and make for a great and immersive experience. however, if you have a low end pc they might be an issue for you. i dont run an amazing setup, i play most of my games on a laptop and i usually don't get lag or graphical issues. however, i noticed that in dark levels and levels with liquid the game would slow down to a crawl. a day or so later a patch came out that made the game feel much less laggy and everything is playable again. im not certain on this so you'll probably have to check up with someone else but if you have a really old and bad computer you might want to look in on it.

 changes for the better 

now, there's a lot to pick apart so i'll be as concise as i can.
first of all, the rides.
the rides are a newly added mechanic in the sequel and i like them quite a bit. they offer unique mobility and attacks to enrich your run, and anything that makes your life easier in an even harder game is certainly welcome.
second of all, the new areas.
spelunky 2 adds several new areas and has most of the old areas at least somewhere present from the first game. thematically, the new areas are great. the new traps, obstacles, enemies and music are pretty sweet. most of the new enemies are very interesting and very few of them are annoying to deal with. the few new items that we did get were all pretty nice and interesting.
third of all, the characters
spelunky 2 adds a bunch of new characters and most of them are cool and well designed. ana spelunky and LISE are some of my personal favorites. it's also nice that we've gone from a male/female damsel or a dog/sloth to a hamster, cat, or dog.


so, should you buy spelunky 2? yea.
if you have to choose between spelunky 1 or 2 i'd say you should go for 2 since there's more content in general though both are great choices and phenomenal games.",1601859656,1601859851,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198338229342,34,5,1000,1000,956,1601869485,,

Wanna be a Spelunker?
 
You're in luck. I'm going to tell you but let's face it. You don't really want this do you? Want to be a SPELUNKER?
 
Really?
 
Want the Cavemen dropping their jaw when you walk in the room?Want the Quillback saying WTF when he sees you? 


Really?


Yeah, most guys do but they don't want to work for it. Face it. Most guys are lazy, don't want to sacrifice and can't rescue the pet on every level.. I'm not going to BS you guys in this review. I will lay it all out but the truth is we don't really want it bad enough. We say we do until we are 45 minutes into our tenth run trying to unlock the shortcut that day.. WE say it until our thumbs hurt so bad there are tears in our eyes and we give up. We want it until we’ve been gibbed by a push block for 4th time that day...I say I want it but I love casual games more, so I go back to fall guys...I say I want to be a Spelunker but I don't want to work for it. I'm 45 minutes into my run with 1 heart because of a witch doctor and my will feels broken...I can't go on, or can I??? Do I really want this life? No time but time to train. Time to find the turkeys. Time to carry the ghost pot to the end of the level, Time to save that freaking pet again. GOD I CAN’T DO ONE MORE RUN…
 
My whip is in frays. My veins look like spider webs all over my body from all the ledges I've held onto. I catch Kali being happy with me the moment I enter 1-1, she knows I treat her well. She knows everything that moves is getting sacrificed in these caves. Shopkeepers don’t even blink when I enter the store anymore. They just hand it all over. I can't take it. I’ve put dozens of hours into this but that's not what they want to hear. They want to hear about the shortcuts. You PM me every day. Same questions over and over. ITS NOT THE SHORTCUTS DUMMY!!! Or is it??? Yes and no. Can you handle the daily challenge? Can you handle Putting yourself on walk as a default and taking your time through a run?
 
Really??? 2 weeks from now you will PM me again whining. I can't sleep. I can't go this slow. I get soft locked on the lava stage. Moles are unfair. . I can't. I can't... THEN STOP PM'ing ME!!!! I can't help you. You don't want this! Just admit it! You don't want this. It's hard. It hurts. You have no social life. You are in the caves when your buddies are drinking beer.You are collecting gems when guys are lying on the couch. You spend your last $2500 on bombs or some ropes. I know all this because I am you. I want it for 2 or 3 runs then I give up. I don’t want to do 100 runs a day. 
 
It’s ok. Get some sleep. Wake up and enter 1-1. God I love 1-1. Grab 1 more pet. I love it. My pockets are packed with ropes and bombs. Off to work. Spelunky after work. Get the adventure pump. Here they come. “How do you get so far????” Not this again...I'm on a crazy train.I hate my life but god I move fast and I can get to zone 4 consistently. Go ahead Olmec, mess with me. I will make fast work of you...Kali is in my head. Is she cheating on me? How much sleep did I get last night? 3 hours max. Eat 4 whole turkeys and wash it down with some spider paste.. Getting tired, I need some more bombs.. Ok, bomb pack is only 10k in this level. That’s only 1 ghost pot and some change. Time to finish this.


You want to spelunk with the best?? 
 
You gotta grind Zone 2. Zone 3. Zone 4. ZONE 5. ZONE 6!!!!! YOU GOTTA GET TO THE TEMPLE AND FIGHT ANUBIS WITH YOUR BARE HANDS UNTIL YOU'VE BEATEN HIM SO MANY TIMES HE DOESN'T OPEN HIS EYES THE NEXT TIME HE SEES YOU TO AVOID THE FADE

Do you really want to be a Spelunker??? Really..?
 
I read  the comments every day at the community page. Same guys doing the same routine complaining about dying in the same way and in the same place they did 3 days ago. Talking while streaming and then complaining when they get taken out in 1-1 by an arrow trap. It isn't work, it's social time for them. I can't be social in the caves. I'm not built for it and I don't want it.I'm there to work, to train, to push my body beyond what the average guy can do.

Death works differently in the caves. We don’t die here we just get stronger and LEARN from our mistakes. My turn. Time to WORK. I warm up imagining the run before I do it. The turkeys are pulsing through my body. I can see the gems through the walls. God how I love the taste of my own blood when I take a drop that was too big but I have 25 hearts so it doesn’t even matter anymore. I have been pushing the Kali alter to the limit and getting in the blood. I'm ready. I'm jacked to the max. A leprechaun is child's play. I need to push in just a little more gold. 10k for a bomb box, and 50k for a shortcut. Maybe a bit more. Screw it, just break the ghost pot in the beginning of the level and speed-run the cave. Easy. I am making changes everyday. I don’t ever die the same way twice. I don't want to be the same. I can't be the same.

The controller is cold in my hands. I pump out a few fast runs.Load the game up before work. Maybe I will get 4 runs. Maybe 5. I look at the guy asking for help in the forums. He’s never made it past 2-1. What a joke. This isn't a casual game it's a place of employment. I'm here to WORK. Screw the characters. I don't need 37. I just need Colin.. I start the run and hear the music. I make it to 5-3 on my first run. Hell yeah! I'm just getting started. OH great.Here comes some guy telling me how good I’m doing. Looks like he has never found the black market a day in his life. I ignore his questions and turn up my music. I'm trying to concentrate. Get away from me my mind screams. I have to be cool. Don't want to get kicked out of the caves....again...I feel rage inside me. Good. Channel it. Put it to use. Hit the run again. I don't want to be the guy who accidentally blows up his pet because he misplaced his bomb by 3 pixels.. I want to make changes. God the pain is bad tonight. Lactic acid is heavy in my thumbs. Ok, enjoy the pain. Like it. It's good. Trick your mind. I like the pain. I want the pain. I'm grinding out slow and patient runs. It burns my mind to not just hold down the R trigger but I tell myself it's good. My rest between runs is minimal. I have done 5 runs but the guy streaming has died on 1-3 4 times. God he’s pathetic.
 
Time for daily challenge. I put on my spike shoes and take the path to the left to go to the jungle. I stick the queen bee with a bomb like it’s nothing and collect my hearts. I’m at 17 on 2-3. The guy on youtube is playing like he is strolling through the park. He doesn’t see the spiders and gets hit by them everytime. Then he comes on here to complain about the difficulty. Hell, I can barely see my own screen at this point but I can FEEL where the spiders are. I am feeling my thumbs burn. Just 1 more minute to go until the ghost comes..need to collect 7k before then so I can buy out the black market. Ok, go to that place in your mind far away. I look down and 15 minutes has gone by in what seems like seconds. I’m past Olmec. Good. Go to that place some more. I am absolutely covered in sweat. My shirt looks like I pulled it out of a bucket of water. I finally finish and log off.

It's late and I'm hungry. I feel dizzy. I walk out of the caves. and go get some food. Everyone is holding down R.. I can't believe how hasty everyone is. They are pigs. I am in a world of casual gamers. How can these people live with themselves? Never making it past zone 3?  I feel hate. Why do I hate these casual gamers? The ones that think the game is to blame for their poor performance.  It's weird but I feel like yelling at them to wake up. I'm a Spelunker. It's exactly what I want. I'm walking art. My art. My sculpture.

You can only take 4 hits until your dead.  But when this happens every couple seconds.  It feels unfair & cheap & just unavoidable.  The hit boxes of way off in this game.

82,76794720,english,"This review is going to start with one simple phrase to essentially sum up the entirety of what I am about to say. ""Randomness is not a good way to scale difficulty.""  -Me, 2020.

While this is an amazing sequel to one of the best platforming games I've ever played it does has some faults that may mostly be personal gripes, and feel free to comment as I've enabled them, but give me your opinions as well.

+ Graphics look smooth and the textures are much better
+ Some of the movement mechanics feel better from the previous title
+ New enemies providing a much needed challenge to some areas
+ New traps also providing a much needed challenge to some areas
+ Tons of unlockables
+ New map layouts that seem to make you use resources more often 

The negatives are now redone as I have played over 20 hours. Much of it is unchanged from the original.

- Hit boxes for enemies when jumping on them is wonky. Sometimes it'll be fine hitting a lizard slightly off center, other times it won't be. Seems to be absolutely random.

- Whip still has issues hitting certain enemies unless you use the reverse whip strat which is, in my opinion, a coverup for a broken mechanic.

- Caves is the most frustrating level. Often times there are so many enemies with insane movement mechanics clustered in one spot, choking the only exit from the map, or too many times you take one hit that results in your run ending or you taking several hits just because of the clustered enemies. This is frustrating beyond belief. Caves feels like being stuck in molasses and the second you get out of it to another stage it's like you're free of traffic and able to really hammer on the gas pedal and go as fast as you can. 



Mostly Derek just needs to fix old issues from Spelunky involving hit boxes of enemies because it's ultra frustrating jumping onto a lizards head and instead of killing it you take damage, then it turns around and spins and knocks you into a mole and you die. Every stage feels like a vast improvement from the counterpart from Spelunky except Caves which feels like he tried to make the game harder but only succeeded in sapping any of the fun of the game and replacing it with frustrating enemies clogging up entire chunks of the map.

I have several screen shots and quite a few videos of these mechanics failing. Clear recordings where the whip passes through enemies and does nothing, and other instances where the whip is nowhere near the enemy and it kills it. Videos showing how there are insane amounts of enemies on 1-1 clogging up a single choke point with like 3 moles running around, 2 bats flying and a pair of cavemen talking near a lizard. It's bizarre and something you should really only see on later levels. And I also have several clips of enemies triggering traps or trap mechanics because the area is just so clogged with them and this causing issues with shop keepers, the ghost pot, or myself.",1601437861,1601830924,True,0,0,0.440653204917907715,5,True,False,False,76561197988040892,246,90,1515,1515,1449,1601865336,,

I think it'd generally be fine if you already are a fan of rougelikes, but if you haven't played many or aren't a big fan you might be frustrated with the learning curve.

The sheer amount of content in this game could last me several lifetimes and I don't ever think I would get bored. I love the new artstyle compared to Spelunky HD, everything looks super clean and distinct, and most of the levels look super cool. I like the choice the game gives you to go to different branching paths at the end of 1-4, it opens up a lot of different possibilities and strategy on which area you want to go to. The shortcuts are rewarding and difficult to unlock and give you quick and easy ways to practice and experiment with some of the later levels. All of the new items and world themes fit in super well and are very fun to play on. A pro or a con depending on the person, but the skill gap is really wide, and it's really rewarding to master every level and slowly start making it further and further.

I only really have a couple of complaints, sometimes enemies spawn on top of doorways that you exit out of so you have to react in .1 seconds or else you'll take a hit. I assume it''ll be patched but who knows. I also wish that in 1-4 the random layouts were a little more random, I get that it's a boss level but the paths leading up to him should be a bit more varied. I really like some of the music in this game, the yeti cave music and the dracula's castle music are absolute bops, but it seems like there needs to be different track options for levels. In the first game I remember at least 2 or 3 possible tracks per area, but in this game I only have noticed one per area. The songs that are here are good, just wish there were a few more.

Spelunky 2 understands that, and builds upon the established rules old players already understand so these random ""spelunky moments"" become part of your every other run. You can never be too careful in this game, acting without a plan will get you killed and even the smallest oversight in your strategy can still get you killed, and the best part is that the game earns its difficulty trough complexity and new mechanics.

39,77005964,english,"Let me start with some positives:

The new areas are conceptually good.
I like a lot of the new items and characters.
The background area idea is great.
The alternate floor idea is good for run variety... except for the first floor which doesn't have it.

And for the rest:

Area difficulty flow is out of order (first area is significantly harder then later ones).
Floors can take significantly longer then spelunky 1 due to enemy/trap overflow (a simple count of traps and enemies in spelunky 2 makes it apparent how many more there are then in spelunky 1). 
There is a lot of RNG item costs depending on item spawn locations, which can rarely completely brick a run.
Strange balancing decisions (jetpack + any fire damage = instant death, but this also is instant death for the much less useful hoverpack for example).
A few boring boss fights (olmec is here, and after phase 1 you just sit around until the entire floor is gone. Takes about 3-ish minutes of standing still).

To go into detail: 

The balancing is out of whack, with floor 1 being MUCH harder then either floor 2 areas as well as one of the floor 3 areas, and one of the floor 3 areas (T) being much more difficult then the other floor 3 area. Some enemies have status effects that can end a run (curse or a bad poison), while enemies that should be threatening (often big ones like mummies or anubis) are easier then regular small enemies. Also areas can take much longer then spelunky 1, making it a bit of a drag to restart runs (especially with some floor feelings being effectively the same unchanging level over and over again... I'm looking at you 1-4).

The background area mechanic is a great idea that goes nowhere except to lengthen runs. They often either have nothing, or the same exact repeated rooms every run. For a roguelike hybrid, I've never felt like I've seen the same exact rooms this often in any other game except DoomRL's special floors. Spelunky 1 at most had the castle with this issue, but that was one area, while here there are a lot of often repeated background rooms. You'll find yourself skipping them 90% of the time unless it's required for secret progression (and some areas like the black market are now background areas for example).

Trap & Enemy quantity is also way up (2x from spelunky 1), but they have decided that visibility is bad, so they decided to blend most of the traps in. Remember when Team Fortress 2 made sure that every class had a distinct silhouette so that you could react to it quickly? Imagine if many mid game traps were trying to look like the same exact thing as the walls, and you get the omnidirectional spike traps in the jungle and the crushers in the temple. Yes, they decided to make the formerly distinct, spiky grey crushers in a tan temple, look like background scenery. It makes the game forcibly much slower, and generally less enjoyable. Due to this and piling as many enemies as traps as they do into much smaller spaces, deaths can come very spontaneously, and often for reasons outside of your own hands.

The mount system generally ends up just being the inability to hurt an enemy by jumping, as otherwise they are often useless and just make you more vulnerable (or with more items, less mobile then not having them).

And the boss fights are incredibly slow and common. Olmec appears mid-game, and while the first part is the same (but easier), the second half is just sitting around until they blow up the rest of the level, allowing you to get the second path or obtain a certain incredibly valuable item from the first game by going through the third phase (which consists of waiting in the second phase until they blow up the floor for the third phase). The waiting around can take a long time, and is literally just sitting and doing nothing in safety. It's not fun. Other parts have forced waiting as well, such as a lava themed second floor where you can use a drill, and if you do, you have to just wait or risk instantly dying to lava physics as when the drill goes through the lava, it leaves it all slowly pouring down for 30 seconds to a minute.

I'm no stranger to challenging platformers, nor challenging roguelikes, nor challenging platformer roguelike hybrids (or other games in general). Spelunky 1 was one of my favorite games, and I went out of my way to not only get every achievement, but had a blast doing it. Spelunky 2 is an ok game up to the point I've played, but it has a large quantity of problems that holds it back in comparison to the first, and after not too long (under 50 runs), becomes very grating. I have not yet completed the game, and unlike Spelunky 1 I don't enjoy playing the game much. I'm going to give it a full shake before I drop it, but based on what I've seen, I have no reason to believe that it becomes any better, so for now I can't reccomend it. If you've never played spelunky, just get the original for now.

What I love:

+  A technically upgraded Spelunky 1 with extended content.

What I'm not having fun from:

- A game of learning by failing, but the skill I've mastered feels way way less important than luck.

- Unbalanced reward/difficulty design between main stages and secret doors: the density of traps in main stages is too high and it made me exhausted / very little rewards in most secret doors, besides most of them are not challenge-worth but waste my time to get a little gold cheaper than my ropes and bombs I spent.

- Paradox of game mechanic: I can feel tons of mechanic encouraging me to explore every corner in a stage but the time-up feature is so short and it forces me to rush. Although there is a timer ticking on the upper-right screen, it's the time you spent rather than the time remaining, so I don't actually know how much time I still have and it made me hard to make the decision whether I should keep exploring or just run away. I also don't like the way the time goes up -it's simply a hard-to-avoid ghost appears from either horizontal side, rather than a way that better matches each level's theme.

- Un-unified grace time: Sometimes I'm invincible for a short period with flashing after a hit, that is good, but that does not always happen, e.g. a mosquito can pin me from side to side until death, or a boomerang hitting me continually and I don't have a chance to get up. The problem is not with or without the grace period, the problem is the grace period is un-unified and is hard to understand.

- Un-unified whipping logic: I can't whip an NPC like a flower or a barbarian to die, I have to wait for them to wake up and whip again and repeat this way again and again if there is no trap around, but I can still take damage when I'm dizzy, that's not reasonable.

- Un-unified dizzy period: Sometimes I want to carry and throw an NPC who is dizzy, but I'm not sure when will it wake up because not every one in every situation wakes up after the same dizzy duration, which is really cumbersome to diagnose.

- Un-unified spike logic: I can step on big spikes carefully from the side or half grid from above, that is good, but I can take damage from small spikes this way or a mosquito whose mouth is already pinned in the wall.

My best memory is still in the GameMaker-made Spelunky classic, since it defines rogue-like games.

I have too many reservations in the current state of the game. I expected to be playing this non-stop for the first days after release - like I did with S1 - but many aspects and design decisions in the sequel have to be mentioned to put all the positive reviews here into perspective.

So far, I can not fully recommend S2 because it makes alot of mistakes S1 didn't. After about 4 hours of gameplay, I finally have reached the 2nd biome twice. Hooray, so far so good! BUT: The way there felt very repetitive since the player has to replay the first biome so many times and doesn't see anything new that S1 didn't include. The few new monsters (lizard, mole) are way too strong for a first world. They are too fast to avoid sometimes, very unpredictable and they have too much HP. Additionally, the maps don't play as nicely as the predecessor's. Corridors sometimes are paved with so many arrow traps that you find yourself having to whiplash arrows mid-air to procede. And even for medium-skilled players like me (I played S1 until Olmec and have about 35 hrs of playtime in 1) this is a tough move to pull off, especially since the handling of the whip feels off somehow in comparison to 1. And c'mon: Spiders that you can't even see because they drop from behind curtains above? Seriously?
Furthermore, the annoying turkey guy quest (in 1-2 and 1-3) and the savage boss (1-4) are not random instances but spawn every run. Just why? Can it get more repetitive than that? I cannot stand one more ""gobblegobble""! I already decided not to bother anymore and bomb them for the HP. The rewards for bringing the turkeys back are just way too little to care.

These are my gripes about the game so far. Biome 2 is actually very fun and the core gameplay is still amazing. I still think that alot of the positive reviews are written from a too nostalgic standpoint. If you are new to the series and want a well-balanced Spelunky experience, play Spelunky 1 instead and wait for patches that spice up world 1 content and generally balance the game. Plus, beware: For new players, the difficulty of the sequel might be off-putting.

43,76976215,english,"Disclaimer: I have over 330 hours in Spelunky HD, and several in the original. In Spelunky 2, I have not been able to get further than 2-3, in either the jungle or volcana, so my review will be limited to those areas for now. 

The Good:

It feels like there's an extra level of polish added to SHD. The graphics style, while different, is gorgeous to look at. Especially in the jungle, everything looks absolutely beautiful. The dwelling area is fairly bland, and after playing it for hours, it doesn't get any better. 

The controls feel dialled in just that extra little bit more. If the controls in SHD were tuned to 98%, S2 takes it that extra 2%, and it feels great to land a difficult jump, execute a complex series of kills quickly, or play around with a new item. 

The sound design is quite good. While there are some controversial changes, specifically the gold/gem collection sounds, they don't bother me nearly as much as I expected. The music feels like it was created with love and care for the environments in which they exist. Volcana has an especially catchy tune. Other sound effects are simply OK, but none are particularly irritating, they just make me scratch my head and think ""why""? Like for example, arrows no longer make that 'tink tink' sound when they land. Why not? It was helpful to have a clearly audible indication of when an arrow trap has been neutralised. 

The Bad:

As I mentioned, I have hundreds of hours in SHD, and love that game to no end. It was punishing, relentless, and difficult as heck, but also felt rewarding and fun. Dying was (almost) always your fault and your fault alone. It left you with that feeling of 'just one more try'. S2 lacks that to a damaging degree. 

The dwelling is ridiculously over-difficult for a starting area. And I understand that this (and other similar types of) game are designed specifically to be extremely challenging, but there's a point where it goes too far and replaces the fun aspect with frustration. People don't play games to yell F**K and S**T at their TV, and twist their controller in anger. People play games to have fun, and the first area of the game simply isn't fun. Let's tally up the things that are stacked against the player, and the added things that the player has in their favour. 

- All of the hazards and enemies from SHD return.
- Moles and Lizards are added, each with 3 HP, and each with highly challenging behaviours to combat. The mole is essentially able to invisibly travel through dirt blocks, until it rises up or drops down onto you. The lizard roll-charges you, often resulting in being stun-locked, which is an unforgivable cardinal sin of game design. Stun-locking is an absolute no-no in game design, no matter who uses it. If the player can stun-lock, it breaks the difficulty of the game. If the enemy can stun-lock, it breaks the player's chance at winning. There's no way around it, and no way to make it work. If a stun-lock is possible even 1% of the time, get rid of it, change it, it doesn't belong. Period.
- The player's whip has been nerfed, having smaller and less effective hit-boxes than SHD. 
- Enemy hitboxes seem to have been reduced as well, making it more difficult to land an accurate stomp, whip, or throw.
- Skeletons have had their speed increased significantly, and can no longer be stomped from adjacent ledges while idle. 
- The ghost(s) are significantly more deadly, with increased speed, altered movement, and the ability to split into a total of 4 ghosts. While the player has an additional 30 seconds of grace before they appear, once those 3 minutes are up, you'd better be close to the exit, or else you will die. 

And what does the player have in their favour to help them deal with these additional challenges?

Turkeys. 

Spelunky 2 is a great game, and has been crafted with love for the original, and the fan-base. However, there are certain aspects that should've been more carefully designed.

The immediate and unrelenting difficulty alienates new players to the point of unshakeable discouragement. SHD didn't need to be impossibly hard, it needed more content, which this has, to be fair. But where's the fun in discovering new content when any single wrong turn, bad button press, or blink at the wrong moment erases all discovery and exploration?

There's a reason why videogames, songs, movies, TV shows, books, etc mostly all follow a similar formula; it works. I'm all for breaking the formula, as long as it still works. In the case of videogames, you start with the easier stuff, so that you can build skills, abilities, collect items, what have you, in order to make progression possible. But when you start with high challenge right off the bat, the player doesn't have a chance to get better, explore further, discover new hazards, or figure out what new items do. 

Game design is a very delicate balance that requires many many hours of testing, tuning and tweaking things to be *just* right. S2 feels like it was tested only by the most skilled players of all of the elite. 

I can't speak for everyone, but I play games to have fun. This game makes me feel more frustration, anger and irritation than fun. That is why I don't recommend it.

53,76935430,english,"The first stage(Dwelling) is my problem with Spelunky 2. I enjoy most of the game greatly; the gameplay is as fantastic as ever(with maybe some questionable hitboxes) and while most of the areas are harder than stuff in the first Spelunky they feel good and manageable. Visuals and music are both fine though music especially doesn't really hold candle to the first game. The rest of the audio is great with various sound effects mixing perfectly.

But yeah that Dwelling sure is a doozy. It's just too much in too small of a space and playing it I feel less like I'm powering up to face the meat of the game and more like I'm trying to endure past a massive speed bump(at the very start of the game!). There are just so many gotcha-style enemies and traps that the game keeps spamming. It takes too much effort and patience simply to get through let alone gain some advantage/actually building an interesting run that I'm exhausted getting out of it.

And it's one thing to have this intense of a stage later in the game when the player can prepare for it; get some advantage to exploit against the worst stuff. Those stages are here(haven't explored the game at all fully; I have beaten it once in a full run) but as the first stage Dwelling is kinda miserable. There is so much variety and secrets in this game but I'm being slowly drained by the first area and it's such a shame.

Now all that said I'll keep trying and maybe with more time I'll start to understand it better.

Heading into Spelunky 2 off the back of hundreds of hours of HD has been great fun and I love a lot of the new mechanics and features, the new shops, optional quests, the back layer, fluid physics etc but I feel like your average person won't find enjoyment from Spelunky 2 for reasons I will detail below

Dwelling, the first stage. I'll split these issues into 3 categories

1/3 Formulaic progression from 1:1 to 1:4
This area is absolutely far too busy and more often than not is extremely unfun and unrewarding. 1:1-1:4 is practically the same everytime save you may find an alter or dark level, and the Key/Yang optional quest may alternate between 1:2 and 1:3. For a game like spelunky this repeating formulae doesn't work and results in very boring, time consuming gameplay which honestly just feels like a chore. I realise the turkeys are optional but the health they give for blowing them up is pretty important considering the difficulty of Dwelling. The further levels do not have this issue really at all. The Quillback fight is incredibly repetitive once you've done it a few times and doesn't need to be a guaranteed event.

2/3 Resource rarity and too resource consuming:
The terrain generation on dwelling is extremely punishing in that you practically have to use all your resources to get around, there's many areas where it's completely impossible to scale back up the level without sacrificing ropes. it's not uncommon to have to use 2 ropes and a bomb or two to get Udjat eye. This wouldn't be so much of an issue if crates weren't so rare. It feels like there's maybe a quarter of the crates you got in this level's equivalent in Spelunky HD and even then crates weren't incredibly common. This wouldn't be a problem (and isn't) if this type of resource consuming level generation was saved for later in the game when you have established a run with resources to spare. 

3/3 The sheer amount of mobs, arrow traps + moles and lizards
Dwelling practically plays out like a Spelunky HD Frozlunky Sashavole generation mod, you'll know what I mean if you've played it. The amount of mobs you can see at any one point in the area is far too high, especially considering the moles which have 3 health and can move through blocks + the lizards which also have 3 health and whilst aren't terribly hard to avoid are still very time consuming and frustrating to deal with. I don't know why Derek/The development team decided to add 2 new mobs both of which have 3 health as it breaks down the pacing of this first stage quite a bit. On top of this, moles seem to have iframes when moving in and out of blocks (I've not tried with explosives as bombs are precious on the first area). Additionally there's also an insane amount of arrow traps, it's not uncommon to see 2 arrow traps pointing directly in the area of your spawn from the getgo, and there's plenty of traps which cannot be dealt with via arrow whipping due to their placement which further breaks the pacing as you have to go find an item to set them off.

Also, the music for Dwelling can get incredibly grating and is generally slightly disappointing when compared to Spelunky HD's first area's 3 great songs, though I appreciate it does fit the theme of the level.

The culmination of all these things makes the first area game a complete slog and will definitely put off would-be new players.

Post-Dwelling

Once you're past the first area the game is actually incredibly fun, Jungle and Volcana are both equally interesting areas. They both have lots of variation and extra flair added to them. Volcana having dead are restless, dark and the factory variations which are rare and exciting to come across + Vlad's castle and the Jungle having dead are restless, dark + the black market and any other variations I've not yet seen. Both areas contain unique, fun and challenging mobs without being overbearing (moles, lizards)

The Olmec fight is okay, it's kind of silly that on the second stage you practically just AFK whilst he destroys the level so you can decide if you want to go to temple or tide pool, but it's okay and i appreciate olmec is kind of a nice homage to the first game if anything even if the fight isn't great.

From my experience Tide Pool, Ice Caves and Babylon are all good zones although I think Babylon's mobs are a little bit boring mechanically even if their artwork is awesome, I've not played enough of temple to comment. Although all of the zones except for maybe temple are far more laid back than the clusterfuck that is dwelling and it causes the games' overall progression to feel disjointed and weird as the game is seemingly getting easier from the first area.

I will note that Tide Pool is a particularly beautiful zone with a brilliant soundtrack and comforting colours on the eyes, I think the balance there is absolutely spot on and it's plenty interesting with the different shops, Excalibur to retrieve, levers which you can interact with to alter the level + other things in the back layer I've not yet worked out.

The problem with all these great zones and pieces of content is that when you die (and you will die a lot) you are sent back to the insanely grating and unfun first zone which really kills motivation to play in general for me. I generally am more upset over having to play on dwelling again than I am about losing all my gear and progress. However I do appreciate the game has only been out for a few days and there is a certain amount of time that needs to pass before people properly adjust, especially HD veterans.

If you are considering buying this game and have not played Spelunky HD, I strongly suggest you go play that before you make a decision as it is on sale fairly frequently and is a great game, especially for its low cost.

I hope the Spelunky 2 team makes some adjustments to Dwelling, either mob spawning being toned down, moles and lizards are adjusted (health, speed or something else) or at least spawn crates more frequently throughout the level to give the player a chance in terms of resources.

Small annoying side notes:
Jumping feels very shallow compared to the first game

Unable to whip and descend a platform simultaneously making quite a few arrow traps impossible to deflect and also generally feels clunky. Big problem on dwelling

Hitboxes on mobs, particularly skeletons, moles and the rockdogs feel incredibly small if I am off centre by even a fraction I will take damage from what should've been an easy stomp, which makes the game feel clunky and unfair

Mobs can spawn incredibly close to doors which results in very cheap damage, particularly bad after the Quillback fight though it is possible to look down and work out if there's mobs hanging around that door in particular.

Drill on Volcana almost always goes through lava which can make getting down to Vlad's castle practically impossible which means the time and resources spent getting the Udjat Eye are essentially wasted.

Completing Yang's quest in 1:2/1:3 is worthless as you aren't even guaranteed a single crate for the time it takes to do it",1601582571,1601737112,False,122,4,0.808013916015625,20,True,False,False,76561198037064094,90,7,1643,1643,1173,1601916905,,

So I have only made it to both of the second worlds, and have beaten Olmec in Spelunky 1 a handful of times

SLIGHT SPOILER WARNING  (YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED)



I feel this game is very much new player friendly, less instadeath spikes, Invincibility frames instead of getting stunned for a long time, Dart traps seem to fire arrows slower, some of the cooler items that were harder to get can be bought in shops (shield), the traps seem to be less enviormently destrucive (Boulder trap compared to the falling pillar),Health being much easier to obtain(turkeys), and the mounts all make the game a bit easier and your health bar is not nearly as much of a lie as it was in the first game now its actually about HP/2 as in the original it was more akin to HP/10 in terms of how many mistakes you could make until you died

Personally some changes I would like to see are

---a way to get rid of upgrades or better controls for some upgrades (I'm looking at you climbing claws)
---Making the Kali's cappalla harder to get (it just seems like there are so many sacrifices readily availibal with the turkeys)
--Ghost taking longer to spilt
--Dice Shop being bigger or being able to roll the dice by crouch droping so the shop keep doesnt get pissed at you for rolling the dice a quarter of a block out of the shop

For the most part, Spelunky 2 is faithful to the original's ""tough but fair"" design. Almost every death will inevitably be your fault, and not the game's. Rarely, a drop of lava might decide to fall on your head or a nearly invisible beartrap will snap your legs off, but these instances are few and far between. Spelunky 2 is a game that will reward a player who takes the time to learn its unforgiving mechanics.

1,76859978,english,"Rather than just writing a negative review, I want to give some constructive feedback. I hope the developer sees this. My main gripe, as with many others (about 10% of reviews) is the first area of the game. It's way too difficult when it should be the easiest area to traverse. There are a few easy fixes that can make the first area more balanced. 

Here is how I think the first area can be tweaked:

-Reduce the health of the Moles and Lizards from 3 to 2. 
-Reduce the spawn rate of Moles and Lizards by 20%-25%. 
-Make it so that when you complete the Turkey collection quest, you're given a tier 1/tier 2 shop item. There needs to be more incentive to do this quest.
-Reduce the speed of the ghost slightly, and increase the amount of time you have before the ghost splits into 2.

Those are my suggestions. I think there is enough negative reviews to make these changes justified. These minor changes can make getting through the first area so much more enjoyable, and will open up the game for more exploration. If some small balance changes are made to the first area, I'll happily change my review.

Thank you for reading,

Sussy.

7,76945309,english,"As someone who has dumped over 100 hours into Spelunky 1, I was hoping for a refinement of the formula and an expansion on the content. Instead, Spelunky 2 feels like the devs just wanted the game to be much more difficult, and not in an actually challenging way. 

In the first zone, the enemies are high-health and often quick fast, so making a single mistake usually ends the run. You may as well not even have health! The density of enemies and traps makes navigating through the level a feel like more of a slog, and the reduced frequency of resources and shops provides little reward for it. You will eventually figure out how to get through the first area more consistently, but even after almost 10 hours, I think less than half of my runs get beyond 1-4. 

My experience with the zones beyond the first area is pretty minimal, but my only real complaints are some pretty specific situations that don't happen super regularly: Bats in the lava area can be placed where there are only falling platforms and you can't always trigger them before starting to cross. This means you either have to take the hit from the bat or create a situation where you have to use several ropes very quickly to cross the lava. The other situation is in the Jungle, with the Witch Doctor enemies. I have been in situations where the terrain made it literally impossible to avoid their attack, which deals 6(!) damage and leaves you unable to heal. 

I do like the new items like the bows and powerpack, and the mounts are neat, especially since you can cook the turkeys to heal, but it's not enough to offset the rest.

It seems like the game could overall be fun since the later areas seem to have fewer, or at least less egregious, design flaws, but since the first area is so unfun, it's hard to want to keep playing to get to the later areas.

15,76942689,english,"What I like a lot about Spelunky 2:

- It really stayed true to the original enough that it doesn't seem like a clone of it, but builds upon it
- Soundtrack is phenomenal
- Characters are fun, and a small story is built upon from the previous game which is a nice touch
- The ability to go through passages on different levels adds a cool new dynamic to the levels
- New items and shops are varied and very fun
- The addition of pets you can ride is very fun

What I don't like a lot about Spelunky 2:

Difficulty:

The hitbox for the whip is slightly smaller, and compared to the original the first 4 levels are much more difficult. This is because of the addition of a couple of things. Along with the original monsters, we find two new creatures that have 3 HP. The mole specifically is the most annoying because it rummages through the walls and then jumps out at you, from any direction. Most of the time there is an indication it is coming, but many times not. The addition of the mole and horned lizard wouldn't be too bad if they weren't in the starting area. They could make for some good monsters in later levels. Because of the 3 HP, you have to hit it  of course 3 times, which is tedious and feels like a chore, and wastes quite a lot of time because the time between hits is very long as the creature is knocked out and comes to. If they made it so the ghost comes later, that would help. 

Level Creation:

- Most of the time the game creates great levels, but I've noticed that it is much less forgiving than the original in the sense that areas that you cannot tell are deadends are a lot more common, forcing you to waste ropes/bombs early on. Additionally, one of my favourite aspects of the original was the chance of a ""special level"", like dark levels, the snake pit, spider level etc. In 10 hours of game time, I have seen only the occasional dark level, and that is somewhat disappointing. 

In conclusion:

The game is good, and I would recommend it to anyone who played the original. However, do note that it is much much less forgiving. Between the tougher enemies earlier on, and more of them (I have noticed that it's not uncommon to find 2 moles, 2 horned lizards and more within the screen at once) and more traps (the first area has both the arrow traps and a new version of the tiki trap), you will be resetting a lot more often and earlier on. As a heads up, I was caught off guard upon reaching Olmec to find that he jumps further, faster, and higher than the original. After nearly 10 hours I would say I end 90% of my runs early before even leaving the first area because of not getting the money/gear I want to press forward, compared to maybe 50% of the time in the original.

More enemies lean towards instant or certain deaths (infinite stunlocks) than the first game.

I really hope this gets some patches in the future to fix these issues, or at the very least fix the enemies being right on top of doorways. there's thoughtful hard and there's exercise in futile frustration hard, and spelunky 2 is the ladder whereas the first was not this way.

Edit: The later levels such as Tide Pool are shockingly better than the first one, which feels imbalanced even when the level generation dosen't suck. some minor adjustments like forcing no lava to spawn under the drill's path in volcana would be welcome and make getting to vlad's castle much less rage-inducing since the aforementioned lava has a chance to make that path suicidal.",1601500495,1601688369,False,22,2,0.557532727718353271,0,True,False,False,76561198122755847,180,24,475,475,455,1601697096,,

93,76879812,english,"In short: 8/10 without Dwelling, 4/10 with Dwelling (as of right now, more time to be spent in game)

Quick edit: I've become more consistent with my runs, but I also find myself wanting to not play any more when I'm sent back to the Dwelling. Everything after has been really fun and I can't wait to explore more. Review will stay negative until something is done, though i doubt anything will change

Yet again, there needs to be a middle ground between yes and no for reviews, because right now this is where the game sits for me, coming from the first game with a combined playtime of 400+ hours and all achievements unlocked. As for Spelunky 2, I have beaten the final boss and explored all standard areas (won't be messing with secrets until I can get more consistent with standard runs).

I'll start with what I dislike about the game, because that feels more important in how I decide how much I like the game at the moment. The first area is disgustingly obnoxious and almost the sole reason I am so frustrated and disappointed, it consists of messy (and somewhat ugly) terrain generation that is overly packed with hazards to try and ramp up the difficulty, which just feels cheap and annoying to deal with. There's a small checklist that you find yourself doing that goes 1-1: nothing interesting, grab the dog and/or the ghost jar if they're around. 1-2 and 1-3: order is random but means nothing and doesn't feel random. You either blow the two turkeys up because Yang's quest is not worth it 95% of the time or you find the key and take it to the chest to get the eye, which usually forces you to use your resources that are already quite tough to get hold of. 1-4 is always exactly the same, terrain generation means nothing and you do the same thing every time, except you get to pick which stage is next, which is nice but not enough to justify what you have just dealt with

On top of the obnoxious enemies and checklisting you have to do every single time, the Dwelling's music becomes absolutely grating to your ears and ""dynamic music"" means nothing at all, because it never reflects what you do in-game and just seems to be completely random in how it changes (all of Dwelling's music is annoying, which is a shame because the rest of the soundtrack is great. Perhaps it's because its the soundtrack to the worst stage ever made). I'd be happy to eat my words on this if I can figure out exactly how it works, because the composer put a ton of work into the soundtrack and I think he deserves praise all around

From the perspective of someone that has sunk 400+ hours into Spelunky HD, I believe all of these issues could be solved by toning Dwelling down a notch or two, just to give people more of an opportunity to get a run started so you can get your ass kicked later, not instantly. Speaking of which, the new instant restart feature is both a blessing and a curse, it's excellent being able to skip transitions but also encourages you to just restart upon taking any form of damage on 1-1 as you would in the first game. Perhaps avoid using it until you feel tired of watching transitions

Despite all of the above, I don't think I've managed to express just how terrible Dwelling truly is, every other stage after feel almost spot on in how they're placed which makes it that much more frustrating to know that when you die, you'll always come back to do the same checklist, try and mostly fail to get an okay run going and listen to the annoying music all over again. The charm of being launched across the stage by a chain explosion is completely gone for me because of all this

Mechanically, the game feels pretty decent like the first game, though there are some quirks that become apparent after a few hours that makes it feel slightly less tight compared to the first game. Nothing you can't just get used to. This of course pales in comparison to the negatives of the Dwelling, so I don't feel as if I have to go into any more detail

With the negatives out the way, I'll end this on a brief positive note. The art is amazing across the board, whatever Derek did to make the textures better, he did a great job with it. The music on every other stage is also excellent, I especially like the Tide Pool's music. Mounts are a great addition and there's a fun variety of content later down the line that I can't wait to get deeper in to

I don't want to give this game a thumbs down despite defecating on it for 15 minutes straight, because the first game is very special to me and I want this one to be too. $20/£15 for the amount of content you get is amazing, so maybe the game is worth it despite the glaring issues it has.

Here to put it lightly that one or two brand new things would be awsome but it feels like im being force fed so many things im starting to choke. The shopkeeper change was a welcome one but the down side to that is the weapons. Now there are so many new weapons which are all inferior to the shotgun. (I mean would you take a shotgun or a crossbow that can shoot once)
Plus the fact that bomb bags and bomb sacks explode is bs to me. When you first bait a shopkeeper out of his store, what do you do first? SHOOT LE GUN. Now though, any bombs inside that shop are as good as gone ESPECIALLY if theres a bomb sack. One shot on that and a chain reaction ruins everything. Also hitboxes for shop keeps is janked. Ive died several times where stomping on his head got he thrown by him instead of stunning him. Due to all of this I find everything frantic in a bad way as there is so much to keep track of.

A bit about me: I really liked the first Spelunky, starting with the free version. I wasn't especially good at it, I think I only got to the end once or twice, and I'm pretty sure I left Hell well alone. I realise that, for some, this makes me a filthy casual/a normie/a noob-lord who ought to be lined up against the wall and buggered with sharp-cornered 80s gaming accessories--and perhaps they're right. Unfortunately, because of the Internet, fake gamers like me can still post their unsanctioned opinions. It's messed up, my dude.

Anyway, another reviewer nailed it: they pointed out that the start area is the same as the original's only made harder by the extra stuff jammed in (mostly enemies who are fairly tanky), and that overall the difficulty has been increased through things like smaller player attack hitboxes, etc.

I'm torn here between a couple of possibilities:

[olist]
[*]This feels hard simply because it's new and, as with the original, I need to get better with practice. It's not actually harder, just different--different enough that skill with the original doesn't entirely transfer across.
[*]It is objectively harder. This is probably to help justify the game's existence, since it's otherwise very similar to the first one.
[/olist]

At the moment I'm inclined to think #2 is right.

For some, this is a legit Godsend (please see surrounding reviews) but I'm finding it quite annoying. Rehashing an existing game--only making it HARDER and (literally...) IN SPACE!--also seems pretty cynical to me: a symptom of late capitalism certainly, and sign of the End Times most probably. Spelunky 2 should have had entirely new worlds from the first level onwards, with a difficulty comparable to the first--mentalists who enjoy extra hard stuff would have been kept happy with new equivalents to the Hell levels and eggplant runs.

Instead, this so far feels like a more frustrating version of the original. Which makes it inferior, since the original had difficulty/frustration levels pretty much bang on.

NO

Sure, it adds a whole bunch of new visuals and general stuff, -what you might expect from a mere expansion pack perhaps, it does not improve on or fix anything that was wrong with the original game.

-Difficulty is way, way up
-many things now feel deeply ""unfair"" in ways that the old game didn't
-shopkeepers (and now other NPCs, yay) are still ridiculously op, and can be turned forever hostile by monsters rather than the player
-the whip seems to have a smaller hitbox, and doesn't seem to whip above or behind at all like it used to
-the rope doesn't seem to harm enemies like it used to
-enemies still can have multiple HP, and cannot be hurt while they are stunned, worse, there are more multiple HP enemies, and they're harder than ever.
-meanwhile, YOU can still be hit any time, and can still take damage while stunned, meaning that stunlock issues haven't been fixed since the last game.

Don't let the improved visuals fool you, this game is less polished than the first one, not more. This is not a sequel, more of a collection of new content stapled together.

This game makes me want to go back to the first one.

- First that you'll notice is huge framerate drops every time you have an explosion, ghosty fog or a dark level. Even if it is too hard to fix, they should've added frame skip because playing in slow-motion isn't a thing you'd ever enjoy! 
- Second, the graphics design is good, many details to be seen, but the animations and the way you feel them is just crap. Imagine firing a shotgun and feel like it is a handgun - that's about Spelunky 2. Everything feels papercrafty and floaty, killing an enemy makes you feel confused because they just disappear with a bit of blood. 
- Third, the sound design turned up isn't that good as it was in the original 2012 game. Again, you won't feel any efficiency of your attacks, and as I think, some sounds are really disappointing (e.g. boomerang which sounds even louder than a shotgun).
- On the other hand, they made a huge work on lights, shaders, VFX, made the game more replayable and explorable and every run feels more not like a roguelike but an adventure and... that's fun and I still love the game and would recommed it to anyone!

As a person who spent quite a few hours with Spelunky 1, I find the difficulty of this one to be pretty fair, however, people who are new to spelunky should know that this game is extremely hard and [b] it is normal to die a lot! [/b] Don't just give up and assume you suck, practice a bit everyday and you will improve.

The first area has some nasty new enemies but nothing you can't handle once you learn what they do. Some people are arguing that the first area feels overcrowded with enemies and traps now because the new enemies are added on top of the ones from the original game, but I disagree, there's no more enemies per level than in the original game, there's simply more variety of them, which is clearly a good thing.

The new art style is brighter and more simplified, the environments feel a bit flat at times, [spoiler] the new Olmec sprite straight up looks worse than the original imo [/spoiler] , however I think the characters and creatures look generally nicer now, a good example is the cavemen or the bats. They also added some pretty nice looking lighting effects which look awesome specially in dark levels.

Hilariously enough, you can see your ""win percentage"" on your player profile, as if anyone is gonna have a win percentage above 0,01%.

63,76893542,english,"I'll be frank here. I was really excited for this release. there were a lot of changes that were pretty cool but also some fluff and unnecessary changes that make the difficulty really a bit silly. 
First off, i HATE that everything is thrown in an arch for the initial of the throw, and some items react differently to these thows. throwing items in the first was basically your only universal tool and the arch of the throw happened much later. now if i wanna throw a rock, i cant be sure its gonna go where i need it in close quarters. it might just go over the guys head when they are right in front of me or bounce off of the wall upwards. Then the jumping downward throw's angle was set to be farther so if there is something close by this becomes a problem as the item may miss or slide farther than you wanted.
The air control is quite more sensitive/faster so you can do better platforming in ways but this becomes an issue when you're jumping on enemies. you cant on a the control side be comfortable coming from spelunky 1. its a major adjustment for sure. 
Now i really liked the interior areas. at first. but especially on the first level i feel they more often than not just exist not to get you somewhere better or access some better gear at a risk but are just there. in the jungle level they might be just a big death trap with no reason to go in them because they lead nowhere and have nothing in them so why go explore them. 
oh wow, an area that leads to a cave man and a punch trap. but theres a torch over there- TOTALLY WORTH IT right? of course with a randomly generated are you cant expect some goodies every time but again this is the most likely case here. for that reason you're honestly better off staying out of those areas to save yourself time unless they directly lead you out in a more effective way, which is only maybe 1/5 of the time.

by the way straight up, fuck horned lizards. due to the increased air control i dont have that weighty feel when jumping on enemies, so i often BARELY miss a direct jump onto these bastards which usually results in having at least 1 hp or worse.

BUT. I love the characters, i love that the whip is snappier than the last, the art as well albeit it can seeing traps and risks much harder from a glance as it is on the flatter side . music was better in the first but thats subjective. cant wait for online multiplayer.

74,76890736,english,"I'll try to keep this brief - I have a lot of criticisms but I'll keep each one as short as possible.

The game is a lot prettier than the original (it seems like I might be in the minority on that one?) but I'm finding it significantly harder to read the screen at a glance. I'm getting caught by some traps not because of sloppy play but because my eyes are glossing over major threats. Clarity is king in a game like this, and there's just too much detail.

This isn't helped by a general increase in enemy/trap density. The levels are bigger, but they've also had disproportionately more obstacles added. Spelunky was a game that I enjoyed most when I played it quickly - Spelunky 2 kills the pacing constantly, and the new enemy designs exacerbate this.

You've probably heard this ad nauseam already but there are two new enemies in the first area. One is a mole that can move around in the dirt beneath (or above) you and pop out anywhere, the other is a lizard that rolls into you and bounces you around while you're stunned (I've never understood why devs insist on taking away player control when you get hit, Mario World dealt with this better 30 years ago!). They both have three health - a baffling decision - but the biggest problem is the movement pattern of the lizard, which moves a few paces and then stands still. If it's in an area you need to pass through, you have to sit there and wait for it to finish its little dance before you can move on. Other new enemies deeper down are better, but you have to deal with the terrible ones first, so I've focused on those.

(Side note: I've played maybe 50 runs so far and there are two enemies that I've only seen once each. Not sure if that's a bug but it's definitely odd)

Spelunky's controls always felt pretty loose to me (2 is no different), but that was in the context of an easier game with fewer obstacles. A little slop in your play generally didn't matter as long as you played well at key moments. Not the case here - there's so much stuff to deal with that you have to stay on your game or you're dead, and the controls don't gel with that type of gameplay. A lot of people are saying that the whip and enemy hitboxes are smaller/worse - I think they just feel worse because you have to interact with them more, but I could be wrong.

Runs take a long time now. The ghost timer is at 3 minutes this time round instead of 2:30, which is a necessary change. As I said, the levels are a lot bigger and more dense, but that doesn't really make them more interesting to play, just more frustrating when you make a mistake. On my last run before I wrote this, I died on 2-3 to an interaction I hadn't seen before. That stuff is generally fine in Spelunky, but this run took 17 minutes and I wasn't exactly hanging around.

Much like the post-launch re-balancing of The Binding of Isaac, Spelunky 2 feels like a mod for grind monsters on Twitch, along with the other 12 people who think greater difficulty is the only way to improve a game.

Having said all that, I'm still playing it and I'm still kind of having fun, but Spelunky 2 is a massive disappointment compared to the original and I don't know if I'll be sticking with it to completion. Buy if you're a fan of the original and are dying for more (the price is very fair, all things considered), otherwise avoid.",1601606423,1601606433,False,2,0,0.477196365594863892,0,True,False,False,76561197977109239,675,1,467,467,467,1601582044,,

7,76868432,english,"Spelunky was the game that ushered in our current golden age of rogue-lites. It borrowed ideas from rogue-like turn-based games and applied them to a platformer, focusing on difficulty, permadeath and systems that operate with consistent rules. It's one of the purest forms of rogue-lites available, eschewing metagame upgrades and insisting on player skill. Since Spelunky HD, the genre has evolved, and I was curious to see what Derek Yu could do to bring a new version of Spelunky to a world where rogue-lites are now extremely popular.

I have yet to get very far in the game, but I am not disappointed. Most of the issues present in Spelunky HD have been resolved, and the new levels are challenging even for Spelunky HD pros. First, there are more items, and more of them are useful. Second, some of the strongest items from the previous game have been nerfed, allowing for freedom of choice. Additionally, you don't have to rob the shopkeeper anymore to succeed -- the game is far more generous with money. And even though the levels appear more challenging, the game is generous with handing out lives to the player. Design-wise, I would say that Spelunky 2 seems to be the superior game so far.

Some things leave a less favorable impression: The detail in the graphics is spectacular compared to the first game, but the backgrounds are now rendered in a flat, unrealistic style, with some colors being really bad choices. The music is phenomenal, but repetitive -- variety in music has been traded for quality. Some people also miss the specific design choices of the first game, which favored open environments where the player can just breeze around. Spelunky 2 prefers a more cramped style that forces you to choose which path to take. Sometimes, if you want a bonus (like rescuing the damsel), you need to spend a rope or a bomb. I think this is better design -- the original game generally allowed you to never use items, whereas here items are actually a necessity. Boots that allow you to jump higher actually serve a great function in this game, whereas in the first game, they were but an extra icon on your toolbar. Throughout the game, what you see is the designer thinking more deeply about what he wants out of the player, whereas Spelunky HD is more freeform and kind of random. Both approaches work, but my preference is for Spelunky 2's calculated approach.

To sum up, this is a masterful sequel to one of the most masterful games ever made. Big thumbs up.",1601568890,1601592683,True,18,2,0.695599079132080078,0,True,False,False,76561197972089994,1491,16,1684,1684,604,1602051833,,

(Review)
Kind of a Mario Galaxy 2 type sequel in my opinion, but that isn't a bad thing.
Although if anything these types of sequels are bad in the sense that it means you have no reason to ever go back and play the previous version, but that's just a bad mark on Splunky 1.  (1?  HD?  Whatever we're calling it.)

I sometimes feel like I'm playing Ninja Gaiden NES here with how many enemies are on screen sometimes; 1 didn't really have that vibe.

2 really seems to encourage getting enemies out of your way more than killing them, as most of the new enemy types are major hit sponges not even worth the time or risk required to actually KILL them.

Now, there are couple of things to note in my opinion (please note that I did not finish the game yet)

Good:

Is Spelunky, with some additions, so you have more of the game you like. This alone is the big plus!!

Regular:

One of the things I liked in Spelunky is to run from to the exit as fast as possible. In Spelunky 2 you need to stop in 1-4 and again in 3-1 for miniboses (and is slow unless you are equipped. Not hard, slooow). This slow down the game, and makes it repetitive. 1-4 is mostly the same all the time!
The maps looks emptier than the first game? Or is just the cartoonish look, not sure, but I prefer one better.
For some reason I always have a lot of hired-men that I rescue? 

Bad:

I don't like the music at all (so far) and I hope there is a mod in the future to mod in the original music.
The second layer on the map is more annoying than anything else..",1601587637,1601587691,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198081233667,613,23,447,447,213,1601979058,,

32,76881152,english,"Preface: I have thousands of hours of playtime in many of the most difficult rogue-likes around. 

This game is a mess. There are other reviews that mirror my feelings on this game, so I'll be general. Scores of enemies that give you little to no time to react, especially when you must constantly scan the entire screen for threats. Wonky hit/hurt boxes. General punishment for strategic thinking (You have a good plan to get by? Oh, here's a mole out of nowhere or a skeleton that does not animate until it's too late for you to react). Abundance of inaccessible areas paired with a lack of resources. Juggled to death for making one mistake, which more likely due to the clunky controls more so than a lack of planning. The moles can be tracked as they dig, but I have 20/20 vision and no other visual impairments, and I have a hard time seeing them as they dig (I can only imagine how impossible it could be if you were, say, colorblind). Beyond gameplay, the music is soooo repetitive. A few more tracks in each area would make the repetitive attempts at the mines a little more tolerable.  

This game just does not want to be played (this is coming from someone who plays games like Nuclear Throne and FTL regularly). I liked the first game well enough, but always thought certain things like hit/hurt boxes and controls could be a lot tighter. I hoped this game would improve on those things, but it's pretty clear at this point that the creators were not interested in making a game for fans of rogue-likes, and instead focused on catering to the .0001% of people that are known for streaming/doing Spelunky let's play videos. I hope for a patch, but doubt we'll get one. Was hoping this would usher in a second renaissance for the rogue-like genre, but I really think it's going to put a lot of people off while only attracting slews of ""git gud"" edgelords.",1601586988,1601586988,False,2,0,0.466582387685775757,0,True,False,False,76561198082572130,42,3,1092,1092,526,1602042307,,

The first Spelunky is one of my favourite games and, in my opinion, is practically a perfect game. So how do you follow up a practically perfect game? Honestly? With more of the same.

Spelunky 2 is made for people that have played the first game to death and whose appetite has not been sated. It is more of the same... but in the right way; more secrets, more items, more locations, more permutations to your run. All combining to create that same addictive loop the first game had.

I don't know if my Spelunky skills have atrophied but it certainly feels harder than the first game and does a great job of subverting expectations. My instincts from the first game have got me killed on more than a few occasions but, like the original, death feels fair, usually teaches you something (and is often hilarious).  

If you have not played the first game and are wondering whether to jump in I'd say go for it, yes you may miss some of the ways this game riffs on the first but ultimately this is a game about exploration and discovering its secrets as the rest of the community does is all part of the experience.

71,76876114,english,"ive been a LONG time fan of the spelunky games. ever since like 2010 when i could play the browser version, to the more recent one that released a while back. i absolutely loved the concept, the graphics, the music, etc. truly one of my favorite games of all time. so you can imagine how excited i was to hear that they were making a spelunky 2. i bought this game the day it came out and i have some issues with it. some are small and some are larger. the first thing i noticed when i launched the game was that the intro cutscene and title screen are BLARING music that cant be turned down. next, you are unable to use a mouse to control any part of this game, which makes menus very difficult since my keyboard has no arrow keys. also i wish that the default control scheme was WASD and Space, then attack as left click and right click for bomb, then shift for rope or something like that. Ive had to resort to playing on a controller. Now my main issue that I have with this game, is with the level design. I like the randomly generated level designs for the most part, but sometimes, the levels are blocked off completely meaning that you are REQUIRED to use a bomb to get through. Also, on some levels the motion-sensitive arrow traps are positioned in places where you are unable to get through without taking damage. Sometimes there are skulls or vases or whatever to drop to trigger the trap, but about 50% of the time there arent. Now these things are likely unintentional given the nature of this game. you start with 4 hearts and therefore taking damage is not a strategy. this game is bugged and has issues that need to be addressed, and i hope that mossmouth can fix these because this game could truly be amazing. As time goes on I'll likely find more issues which i will share.",1601579194,1601579194,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198168185946,48,1,40,40,40,1601559834,,

The original had gotten a bit stale, and it was nice to know the next game was on its way. I got the game as soon as it came out. Since then, I've had it on non-stop. There are so many new characters, and the game looks so nice. I'm glad that the controls and premise of the game are similar, with the community area a really cool idea. The new content is awesome, with small things like new monty skins, to larger things like the new areas. The introduction of online multiplayer is probably my favorite aspect of this game that the original didn't have. I always hated how I had to go to a friend's house, or have them come to mine to play co-op. While pvp was available, I much rather preferred the co-op mode. When I watched the trailer, and saw that the addition of online multiplayer is coming, I was even more excited to buy this game.

All in all, I highly suggest that you buy this game. Many HD players are probably happy to see this come out, (although, it came out on PS4 a while ago), and will be quick to buy. If you haven't played a Spelunky game before, and you're not sure you want to try it, I would still suggest getting it.

1. As someone who has learned the ins and outs of the Spelunky HD whip and platforming mechanics it is nearly impossible for me to adjust my well-trained brain to Spelunky 2 which has made subtle altercations (bad) to the games mechanics.

2. The difficulty is jagged, why did they make this game harder? After 1776 hours of Spelunky HD I was not expecting a challenging experience and I am sorely disappointed that the developers would make the game harder for people like me who have mastered Spelunky HD, I'm very mad that I didn't breeze through this game like a fat kid through a happy meal.

13,76867169,english,"This is a good game, but it has problems the prevent me from being able to recommend it at the moment.

Bad:
1. The music isn't good. Not mediocre, it is just bad with a few exceptions. The first stage has mindless guitar strumming that will grate on you and one of the second stages sounds almost identical yet somehow worse. And there aren't multiple songs that can play per area like in the original. You get one song. The first area song will get to you in particular because of the next reason.

2. The first area is too slow. You spend a long time here. There are two formidable enemies that take a lot of hits to kill, a horned lizard which becomes a pinball of death on aggro and a mole that burrows and emerges at will from the ground. The game is not afraid to throw a lot of these enemies at once too and while you can often ignore the lizards you are taking a risk ignoring the moles, so to play it safe you need to kill them. There are also a lot of arrow traps, and they need to be disarmed which is another time sink. A slow first area really hurts the dynamic.

3. Something is wrong with the hitboxes. I'm not sure if they're broken or too strict. If you land a bit off center you risk getting hit. The whip is also shorter. I don't really understand this since the game is more difficult than the first they shouldn't have reduced your effectiveness at all.

Good:

It's more Spelunky, but harder. This might not be a good thing for people who haven't played the first much but I appreciate it.

This is the word I'll use to describe Spelunky 2 best. As a huge fan of the original retro one and even bigger fan of the HD opus, it goes without saying I had extremely high hopes for Spelunky 2. After all, both of the prior games were pure master classes on amazing game design, certainly Derek Yu could not disappoint, right?

Performance issues, thematics all over the place with no real constant, nonsensical game balance, unfun core gameplay changes, watered down visual style, boring and repetitive OST. Spelunky 2 feels somewhere between tech demo and fanmade sequel to me.

I do think there are some design mistakes here, such as the burrowing moles - it introduces an element to enemy movement that did not exist in the first one outside of the ghost and is not fun or satisfying to deal with, perhaps reducing the running speed on this enemy will make it more satisfying to compensate for but as it stands the enemy breaks the balanced physics established in the first game.  I also hate the inclusion of damaging terrain in the jungle sections with the barbed walls; I want to explore the levels and I want to understand how to navigate them and risk/reward my supplies to do so, these spikes also take this element away from the player completely.

All that said, it's great to play Spelunky again, and for returning Spelunky players you may be expecting to mow through this with your experienced skills but you'd be wrong - on top of the new enemy types, there seems to be a change in the hitboxes of existing enemies, perhaps the old Spelunky was more forgiving but it seems that the overhead approach on many enemies have been tightened up, so where you would hit the top of them before, now you'll take some damage.

59,76855947,english,"I originally wrote this as a reply to another review here, but it got too long so now Ive changed it and its a review by itself. I cant recommend this game over the original, despite it being much bigger. Once the ""honeymoon phase"" of all the new areas and enemies wears off, youre left with a game that simply isnt as enjoyable as the first.

The first area of the game has been made much tougher than not just the previous first area, but the second areas of this game too. Instead of always clearing Area 1 and having a chance to get further, the opposite is true: Youll die in Area 1 more often, and if you break through 1-4, you have an absolute breeze ahead of you, as both branching Area 2 zones are easy in comparison even if you didnt get any items. The harder enemies from the old Mines have been moved way further into the game, where they honestly dont belong and are just too easy.

So why is it harder? Your whip has been slightly nerfed on the front hitbox (but buffed on the back, so at least you can backwhip bats much easier now), enemy density has been increased, item box spawns are reduced, arrow trap spawns are increased, tiki traps from S1 Jungle are added, 3HP Moles that have invulnerability when in walls are added, Horned Lizards with 3HP and a Sonic-The-Hedgehog attack that resists the whip have also been added. Both enemies are very fast, and those Lizards can hit you when theyve already stunned you and deal more damage. I also want to say theres less money available overall due to the new level generation, but I am not fully sure about that and it might have just been me missing the money available.

Nothing in either path of Area 2 is even close to the Dwelling in terms of difficulty. In a roguelike game, you always spend the most time in Area 1, every run starts there and some do get further but not all. 100% of runs go through Area 1, some smaller percent get through 2, and so on. Going through this area every single time is just unfun, and unfair. I consider the ingame shortcuts as nothing more than ""practice mode"", but I found by about 70 minutes into this game that I exclusively started through them to try out the branching worlds because the following areas actually did scream ""Spelunky"" to me.  Unfortunate chain reactions that result in a hilarious and unforeseeable death, guaranteed. And thats what made the first game so magical. The Dwelling has none of that magic, you know whats going to kill you, and its not going to be interesting.

Ive got other, minor complaints too. The music has gone from a collection of random songs for each area (with the chance of easter-egg 8bit music) to the same not-quite-as-impressive tracks used in every area every time. A weird downgrade considering the game features almost every area and enemy from S1, and many are unchanged, yet the music system didnt carry over. The reappearance of old areas and enemies is not necessarily a good thing; your feeling of exploring something new is always going to be shadowed with ""oh nice, thats the regrowing blocks from inside the Worm from the old game, just in a new place"" or ""Theres the Mummy from the old Temple area, nice to see you again"". This game took 8 years from the release to HD to now, and sure it adds a lot of new things, but it ended up feeling like more of a rebalancing mod to the first game, with a slight graphical change and some strange new enemies added that dont really fit the narrative. 

I thought the ""Build a Community, Make Friends"" part of the description would also be a much bigger part of the game than it is. It sounded like a large change from the first game, giving something to do between runs, maybe ""we need X for our settlement here, go down there and get some and we will meet you at 3-4 to get it"" in return for rewards. Theres none of that, this is actually just a little side area to the same hub from S1, where characters now walk around a bit and dont seem to do anything else of interest.

I didnt see the later areas or the secret endings or eggplants this time around. I can almost guarantee that eggplants are here though, thats just how this game seems to reuse the old content. Most likely, so are vampires, jiang-shi, yetis, landmines, Anubis, Anubis II, Yama, the Ankh and Hedjet and Sceptre and Necronomicon... all these things I didnt see are probably still going to be here, the same way they were in Spelunky 1. But in that case, the first game is the better way to experience all of those things. Its more balanced, and more fun, and you die in much more entertaining ways.

70,76853178,english,"SOMETHING TO KEEP IN MIND:

The game has been out a few days now and was presumably mostly purchased by fans of the first game, meaning people familiar with it and good at it. Despite that, per achievements, only a whopping 20% of the population has even gotten to the SECOND stage (myself included). I did not play Spelunky 1 much at all, so thought it fit to just hop right into the 2nd, presumably 'better' iteration. The game is very difficult.

Good: Charming game from what I can tell. I'm assuming if you get good at it the game has its own rewards, as is usual for the roguelite genre. I do like the adventure aesthetic, and despite the difficulty I kinda find it endearing in its own sense. The game produces a LOT of ""moments"" as you carefully navigate a world extremely determined to kill you. Moments being daring escapes, absurd deaths, and all manner of nonsense from the game's physics.

Bad: No idea what else the game has. I just replay the first stage repeatedly, occasionally making it to 2-1. Overtuned difficulty is not helped by very ticky-tacky controls. As someone who beat the OG Ninja Gaiden on NES, and the later iterations on Xbox/360 on Master Ninja mode, I was a little taken aback by how Spelunky's control scheme is not as fluid as it should be for a game that is strictly 2D. Particularly, I found the jumping/whipping timing to be VERY unintuitive and basically had to teach myself to always account for its 'floaty' feel. 

Bugs: I've run into two bugs that required restarts. I do not know what caused them.

Better controls and some very slight difficulty tuning would do the game wonders.",1601543666,1601543722,True,2,0,0.525547444820404053,0,True,False,False,76561197970497804,628,14,362,362,141,1601941258,,

79,76851801,english,"So, I cannot believe I am about to give a negative review to a Spelunky game, but here we are, I guess.

First I should state that I am a pretty big fan of Spelunky games. Started with the original game way back which honestly got me into the whole roguelike/lite genre. Was rather sad when Spelunky HD was Xbox Live exclusive to the point of getting it when I could, only for the game to be released on PC a while later. Played both OG and HD on console to death.

Spelunky 2 honesty looks better, animations are better and soundtrack seems to be higher quality, even if I do not enjoy it as much as either OG or HD.

Why would I give the game a negative review then? Check out a review for this game by a user WolfStar on Steam, he did a much better job than I possibly can do but I will try to do a TLDR.

Game is just so much harder than either OG or HD. I love difficult games but I expect a level of fairness to them. Both previous Spelunky games were pretty fair in their design, always felt like if you are paying attention, you do not really need to spend any resources and they essentially existed as ""payment for mistakes"". In Spelunky 2, you are often faced with situations where you have to spend either a bomb/rope or HP to get out of situations that the game itself put you in, at no fault of your own.

There is also a major abundance of enemies this time around. Kinda like in those Spelunky mods that are like 3x more enemies per floor. It can get so ridiculous that you have entire hallways full of 5+ 3HP enemies. If you do not have a shotgun, you have out of luck.

Level generation in general seems to be much more mean this time around. Often you are spawned and there is a spider right above you. Or you go through small inside-level mini dungeons only to leave on the other side and you spawn inside an enemy and take damage without being at all possible to know about it or even do anything about it.

Then we have poison mechanics. A lot of enemies seem to apply a poison on you which stays for a infinite time AND between floors. The only way to heal poison that I know of is to save a damsel (doggo) which can be difficult if the damsel keeps getting killed before you can even see her. Or if she is spawned inside several layers of wall, which happens so often that after an hour I just accepted it as a new reality of this game.

There are more problems like wonky hit-boxes on whip and your character, also weird technical problems that a lot of people are having, not to mention the weird timed exclusivity deal on consoles that the game had... its a mess.

So I cannot believe I am doing this, but I am going to have to ask for a refund and hope that in the future, the game will get patches and hopefully improvements to the random generator (probably not) or maybe nerfs to certain enemies (also probably not).

It sucks, but this is the reality we live in. Suddenly I really do not want a sequel to Binding of Isaac.",1601540949,1601540949,False,20,1,0.609310746192932129,0,True,False,False,76561198036153954,497,54,127,127,127,1601501878,,

I feel that the game has some of the same issues that I had with Spelunky 1, being the controls feeling somewhat clunky. The character speed being higher than in Spelunky 1 causes me to slip off of ledges more often than usual, luckily this issue can be circumvented by walking.

I'm not surprised by the lack of a dedicated button for picking up/dropping items, but I am disappointed since the lack of such a button makes it difficult and jarring to interact with elements in the environment in fast paced situations. Often I find myself hitting something I'm trying to pick up due to being a few too many pixels away. I also find myself automatically grabbing ledges the same as in the previous game which has a tendency to mess up my platforming in tense situations that require more precise movement.

I like the adjustments made to the climbing gloves that prevent you from grabbing a wall unless you hold directly towards it.

Also, it seems to me that the auto level generation leaves much to be desired, with many areas blocked off unless you use a bomb or rope (usually leading to nothing worthwhile), or with the dog/key placed randomly within walls. 

Personally not a big fan of the controls either, particularly the movement speed. Why is it that you either go fast as shit or slow as balls? Some kind of dynamic acceleration/deceleration would have been nice instead of having to hold a button down to walk/run.

The neutral AI guys are absurdly strong so unless you have a really good setup, you can't mess around with them (even accidentally) else you will die 99% of the time.

Beyond the difficulty though, I'm actually more disappointed in the music. I remember the original having multiple tracks for each area, or at the very least for the world 1 where we spend most of our time. Now each world only has one track, and in just over 3 hours I've already turned off the music and replaced it with my own playlist.

I really want to like this game, and I'm going to keep trying at it, but so far it has felt like it attempts to pack more onto the original title, without realizing the space is way too tight. I feel I would enjoy this a lot more if the first world was nerfed some. Every zone after has felt easier, but because of the way the secrets work I can't just skip past the garbage part.",1601533655,1601533655,False,2,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198009951461,394,4,184,184,184,1601532481,,

2,76847984,english,"This negative review is not to say that the game is bad or that it is a waste of money (if anything it is a beautifully crafted and gorgeous game that oozes passion and love), but rather a warning to newer players, because, for me at least, this game just isn't fun. 

I played a few hours of the original Spelunky back in the day and enjoyed it enough to get relatively far into the game before giving it up for some other rogue lite as my attention span waned. Having been looking for another game to quench my rogue like thirst the last couple of days I immediately bought Spelunky 2 when I saw it in the store this morning.  I knew the first is considered a cult classic and Derek Yu a master at his craft, so needles to say, I was excited.

But... the game just isn't fun for me, at all. 

Firstly it is extremely difficult from the start, with everything killing you around every corner, and not in a dark souls, git gud, kind of challenging manner where you feel rightfully outplayed, but rather in an unavoidable, death for the sake of death way that just gets frustrating after the 20th time.

Secondly, unlike most other rogue lite adventures where death is equally unavoidable, but each untimely demise is a stepping stone towards getting more powerful and getting further each run, Spelunky 2 has very little progression. I know this is similar to the first game, but it just feels even more pronounced here as 20 deaths into the game and you don't feel any more powerful or more capable of traversing further down the cave. 

These two factors combined, the frustrating difficulty and lack of progression, just kills the fun for me and any desire to play anymore. 

Like I said at the beginning, this is definitely not a badly made game in terms of the graphics, story, music, gameplay, etc.., and for that I respect the makers of the game, but it just has some issues with challenge and lack of progression that makes it feel more like a extra-hard-mode DLC for after having completed the original game a few times already and not particularly welcoming to brand new or even just less experienced Spelunky players.",1601533023,1601533023,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198154647435,211,4,30,30,30,1601531018,,

And this just... doesn't feel like an improvement on those games. It's just the same game again, but harder. And... that's not what I wanted in a sequel. I wanted a game that would really expand on the formula. That would have a familiar gameplay loop but present itself completely differently. And that's not what this is. 

The first area is almost literally just the first area from the first game, except they added in tiki traps, moles, and rolling frog things. Did the first area of spelunky need those things? Not really. But that's also not the point. The first area should have been TOTALLY DIFFERENT. This isn't a mod for the original game, or a DLC. It's a sequel. The content should have been new. I also don't see why it needed to be so much more difficult than the original (yeah, it's more difficult), it feels like it may have been designed by someone who's forgotten what it's like not to have played this game for five years.

I didn't get past the first area. I don't think I probably will, because I don't really want to play anymore. Disappointing, overall.

A few minor gripes as well:
Borderless window mode doesn't support my monitor's resolution

90,76838269,english,"A bit too hard honestly. The fun part of the first game was exploring each of the randomly generated levels and acquiring resources and finding secrets. This game right off the bat it is very difficult and you are under-equip. You are really unable to explore / backtrack as you don't have much money or equipment. In the first game you can backtrack and try to get money/treasure and it was equally fun exploring as it was acquiring money to buy fun items. 

In this game the difficulty is pumped up right off the bat and you are at constant risk of death. The levels are designed in a way you need to have ropes and bombs to backtrack (which there aren't much of). So after playing 3 hrs I have spent alot of time in the first area, which is pretty ugly compared to the next areas, and it is a chore. With more items and possibilities the learning curve is fun, but at the end of the day it is a bit too hard to start off and the game feels like a chore. The game seems to want the player to tip toe around for the simplest (and least dangerous) path to the next level, opposed to the first game where exploration and running around was a priority.  

If the game were to keep this difficulty moving forward I think after I complete it I would be done playing. Exploration and finding secrets takes a backseat when you can die so easily in the starting areas. If the game were to stay on this path of difficulty, maybe have an option for 'continues' or adding to the rope / bomb starting count - just a suggestion.

52,76833403,english,"If this was its own indie roguelite and not something associated with Spelunky it might be different, but as the game stands right now I sort of hate it and sort of love it. Overall I wouldn't recommend this game, since the overall experience is tedium, and I can't imagine anyone not invested in finding secrets will enjoy it whatsoever. There are two main problems: 1) they took a basically perfect movement engine and made it far trickier. Smaller hitboxes, worse whip, floatier movement all combine to just feel bad. I'm assuming that the thought process is that you need to make things hard for a Spelunky 1 player with 100 hours in the game, but the end effect is that it just feels like trash to play. Problem 2) the first two areas (three since it splits) are awful. The mines are actually maybe worse than Spelunky 1 temple in terms of unavoidable damage, surprise traps, and bad enemies. I really can't believe the moles made it past testing. I'm already sick of the mines,  which is probably bad for a game that expects you to play a level a thousand times over the course of your experience with it. A lot of the stuff they added is cool, but for the most part everything is tedious.

93,76828343,english,"I love Spelunky. With almost 850 hours played I suppose I'd better, right? That's why I'm so bummed that I don't like Spelunky 2. I've done some thinking and what I think is most missing from the sequel is a lack of balance. Sure, playing the original can feel grueling at times, but the game nearly always feels fair and part of an overall learning process. It always feels balanced. 
It's the balance that feels missing from Spelunky 2. It almost feels as if balance is removed in order to add to the difficulty. For example: in the first game firing a shotgun causes the player to stagger backward a few paces. This can be mitigated by hanging onto a rope or a ladder. Not so in Spelunky 2. Attempting to fire a gun from a rope or will not only stagger the player but knock them from the rope or ladder they've clutched onto. This forces the player to slow down and plot much more carefully how and when to fire their gun, which would be fine, but it's a fast game with a time limit. At the 3:00 mark expect a ghost to show up and hound you around the screen. 
Yet again, though, that balance is missing. 
In the first game with a bit of care the player is able to lead the ghost around the screen to avoid it. In this sequel the ghost splits apart and unleashes multiple smaller ghosts to chase the player, and believe me when I say they move fast. Additionally, the shopkeepers, when angered, can now climb ladders and are less and it feels as if the player is punished for looting the shops, but the game has stacked the difficulty against the player making those items even more needed. Again, the overall impression is one of denying the player in favor of amping the difficulty up but it isn't balanced by anything that favors the player. 
The other big negative for me is that the game just feels bloated. There are so many changes, so many enemies, so many traps, that this fast paced game demands you slow to a crawl ... which doesn't feel much like the game that I love. The first game was platforming distilled down to the best most concentrated elements. This is just ... something else. And apparently that something else isn't for me. I'm hopeful that if I spend more hours on this I can come to love  and if so I'll update my review. 
One final note: the music pales in comparison to the first game. I've yet to advance beyond the level 4 (which to me has the best music) but the music thus far lacks character and leaves little impression.",1601495629,1601495629,False,32,2,0.63832247257232666,0,True,False,False,76561198066411902,81,4,2174,2174,500,1602024519,,

13,76826028,english,"I played over 100 hours of the original HD Spelunky over this summer and became hyper consistent in all of it's areas, earning a confidence I rarely do in games from learning it's systems.
Then I loaded up Spelunky 2, not even a week apart from my last Spelunky win, and got wrecked by molerats and punching tiki traps.
Perfect. Spelunky 2 would be a disappointment if it wasn't even harder, and pushed experienced players to rethink how they approach the game and experience the joy of learning all over again. This process of trial and error is what made the original compelling and I am glad that just in the first levels alone Spelunky 2 has added enough new elements to test my ability to react and adapt. 
Also noteable is that Spelunky 2 is a much faster game. You now sprint at all times instead of holding down the trigger and your whip is much faster too. The weight and heft still feels the same, just accelerated. Of course Derek Yu still wants to make you cry so this means that many of the enemies and traps are faster which create these insane hectic battles where you drop into a pit of enemies and it's your dexterity versus theirs', jumping on heads, whipping airbourne enemies, grabbing corpses and flinging them as suppressing fire for a chance to catch your breath. 
All the new additions to your toolkit are fantastic too. My favorite may be the Hoverpack so far, as it is exceptionally exploitable (stopping midair indefinitely whenever you want? who needs a parachute or a cape?) Taming and riding turkeys adds a much welcome Yoshi style companion, both cute and practical as both a meatshield and double jump.
Speaking of turkeys, you'll notice new NPCs like the Turkey Man. They provide side quests that can garner you additional resources to help you along, and reward careful exploration and memory. Much more of the maps are utilized now that they are pocked with items to be brought to people, side quests to complete, and hidden rooms filled with loot.
I did not mean to write a review this long, but I think that speaks to the power of this delightful game that I cannot help but gush. It's different in all the right ways to make it feel the same as when you first played the original.  Buy it, trust me.

There are a ton of items, maps, secrets, and so on, but the actual game itself just isn't engaging to me on a moment-to-moment basis. The actual act of moving, jumping, and navigating doesn't really involve much skill at all - about 90% of the game is just about looking around, taking note of your surroundings, and being careful, but once you do that, executing your moves isn't particularly fun or exciting. And consequently, about 90% of my deaths came because I walked into an arrow trap I didn't notice, a spider dropped from off-screen onto my head, or I broke a pot that had a snake inside, and not because I mistimed a jump or reacted too slowly to a new challenge. Maybe that sort of slow, methodical style is fun for some people, but I personally just found it frustrating and artificially difficult.

Really, Spelunky 2 feels more like a ""meta-game"" about discovering secrets and fooling around with interactions than an actual platformer - it's a little like Fez, if you could also die at any moment because the game is full of contrived threats that are only dangerous because avoiding them is so tedious that you'll end up getting too bored to properly defuse them. I just didn't find it that interesting, honestly.

I loved Spelunky, I 100% it. But this sequel just feels like a chore rather than fun. In the first game you could run on autopilot, after figuring out enemies patterns and traps, It was fluent, smooth and it felt great.

In the sequel however there's just so much crap that you have to watch out for that it stopped being fun for me and it became concentration gauntlet and patience test. Half of my deaths felt like the matters were totally out of my hands. Tanky enemies early (lizards and freaking moles comming out of the walls) don't help, they just slow down the flow too much. You can't even enjoy a simple pleasure of throwing a rock, because it might hit cursed pot offscreen and release the freaking ghost...

25,76806617,english,"""Please describe what you liked or disliked about this game and whether you recommend it to others.""
Yes. I recommend this game.
No. I do not like this game.

Let me explain.

Spelunky 2 was a game that I hoped I could master, like the first one. That hope is not dead and I stand by my positive recommendation, but until I can find a way to come to grips with this game's mechanics, I'm going to continue to say I don't like it.

Spelunky 2 expands upon the first game. At its very core, that is what it does. It makes the levels slightly bigger and adds a second, hidden layer. It gives you an extra minute in which to traverse those levels. It adds enemies and challenges. But does it do these things intelligently?

Currently, my answer is no. Spelunky was a game about predictability. You could look down and understand everything, and I mean everything that was going to happen in the next cell. You can't do that in Spelunky 2. I would be surprised if that were even the developer's intentions, because it seems like every design change has been to evoke more of the split-second decision-jump-whip that was popular with speedrunners. There are more obstacles in this game. It is slightly larger. That is all you get from Spelunky 2, as far as I've encountered it.

The mole has to be one of the worst additions in a sequel I have ever encountered. I hope that comment comes back to bite me. But from what I can tell it took a perfectly peaceful, yet challenging set of intro levels and introduced a whole extra level of completely random bullshit to them. They root around in the dirt and pop out when they are close to you, which is often when you want to do anything. Cool!

Instead of the Scorpions from 1, there are the lizards. Oh boy, how do I love the lizards. Where the scorpions would charge, lizards roll so you can't jump on them. You also can't whip them. Obviously, you are meant to avoid the lizards for a safe run. But the lizards are everywhere. They are legion. Learn how to jump and scream and throw or you won't make it far!

I made it into the jungle and the lava levels and again... It's needless difficulty, I feel. It's almost as if the developer saw how quickly speedrunners were making it through and decided to just shit on the casual guy. There's nothing fun in the jungle anymore. There are spike traps that are quadra-directional and spike floors and ceilings so watch your every fucking step. There's nothing fun in the hot place because all of the enemies there can hit you from three tiles across and all of the lava can spawn unkillable lava enemies that roam around. Trying to glance down and see what you're jumping into? Fuck you, instantly die to lava. Trying to look up to find a health point? Fuck you, instantly die to a robot.

Spelunky 1 felt like this finely crafted engine of infinitely-replayable levels that was constantly generated to produce a difficulty level that was hard, but fair, and ultimately satisfying.

Spelunky 2 feels like it was made by the guy who made Spelunky 2 after he saw AGDQ and programmed everything with salt slipping between his keystrokes. It's just not as fun.",1601465463,1601465463,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False,76561198025037621,431,7,416,416,296,1601688283,,

85,76797329,english,"My feelings are conflicted. On one hand, the charm and visual design of the game has held strong and has been made even cleaner with the new addition to the Spelunky series. However there were a few questionable decisions made that really make the game feel less enjoyable and overall slower.

Cons:
I cannot fathom the design choices for a few enemies. Moles, while annoying can be mapped out and strategically killed, god almighty if you find yourself against a horned lizards. These buggers will wombo combo you from 4 Hp to death and all that's required is a wall. Many times ill find myself not even being able to react to them with some of the head scratching bad seeds I've gotten. Oh? you wanna go in this shop? get shot by the odd arrow trap in the doorway. Don't wanna loose 2 health? well have fun dealing with shopkeeps for the rest of your ill fated run. and thats another thing! so many of my good runs I've lost to having no resources, due to the lack of shopkeeps i encounter. Also why does the run feel noticably slower than it did in 1? I just feel that too many missteps were made even though there were a bunch of great additions.

Pros: The addition of a ""base camp"" is a really nice touch, seeing all the playable characters walk around and have dialogue really gives them personality. Other than the annoying and frustrating first area the red caves, I absolutely love the other dungeons! especially the mines, they have strategic platforming and can be a fun challenge and the enemies there pose a challenge. I love the changes for the damsels, now you have choice of three pets, monty, the cat and a hamster (bless the hamster). I think the addition of character specific rope is a neat touch. The new slew of weapons all have their place and feel really good to use.

Consensus: While Spelunky 2 excels in many areas, it also has its fair share of drawbacks. The main issue I find is that I could sit down and play a good 3-5 hours of Spelunky in one session, while Spelunky 2 I generally cant play as much because the game overall feels slower and less enjoyable than the first. Overall I'd give it an 7.5/10, but be ready for some frustration that definitely feels out of your control.",1601443853,1601443853,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198036918751,295,7,1142,1142,509,1602021563,,

33,76777062,english,"[h1]Introduction[/h1]
Spelunky 2 is one of those rare sequels that surprisingly not only manages to improve on many aspects of the original game, but does so in a manner that doesn't invalidate its predecessor. It's a peculiar case where - despite having sunk countless hours in the original - I personally struggle to think much of a reason to revisit the first Spelunky, without it taking away the fact it is still a fantastic game on its own terms. Both iterations are timeless classics. Both games are exceptionally well crafted. And yet, even after the dust has settled a few weeks after its launch, Spelunky 2 more tenaciously lingers in my thoughts than what came before it.

[h1]Disclaimers[/h1]
Before delving into the meat and potatoes of what the sequel offers, some transparency is in order. Firstly, the game currently disabled its online multiplayer. Mossmouth openly stated [url=store.steampowered.com/newshub/app/418530/view/2889577613579688664]their reasoning[/url] for this decision, so if this would've been your preferred / only method of playing the game, I recommend waiting. Secondly: even though the PC version only just released, I have already extensively played the PS4 version (to the point of nearly unlocking all trophies) so my impressions are largely based on those experiences. Lastly: although I haven't witnessed many issues myself, if any do arise with the PC version, odds are high they will be addressed rather quickly, going off of the dev team’s fast turn-over rate with their PS4 patches.

[h1]Positives[/h1]
Let's address the immediately obvious difference between Spelunky 1 and 2. Everything you may have known, be it isolated nuances or specific strategies, has outright been changed. Whilst the core premise of Spelunky 2 at first glance seems entirely familiar for players of the first game, overall mechanics were altered to such a degree that a key focus of easing into the sequel, is unlearning the majority of past habits. The threats enemies pose, the utility of items, the hazards or secrets a given area houses, all of it will require a renewed perspective. So much so that, much to my genuine enjoyment, Spelunky 2 outright subverts previously established knowledge many a time!

These adjustments alone already provide a refreshing take on the formula, with various new gameplay additions adding extra layers for you to examine on a per run basis. The liquid physics, the different mounts, branching paths, geographical plane swapping, new types of mysteries to unravel, et cetera; newly introduced features being combined with pre-existing elements ultimately translates in the player [i]'needing'[/i] to absorb a lot of knowledge. Whilst it may sound intimidating, this dynamic of juggling spatial awareness in order to overcome multi-layered obstacles is ultimately what makes especially the sequel shine the way it does!

Although this aforementioned balancing act inherently permeates numerous polished roguelites, Spelunky 2 is by contrast a more methodical spin on the genre than the likes of Binding of Isaac. Devising an overwhelming or synergetic build among copious available items is not borderline essential to victory in Spelunky; whilst still present, its systems are executed in a comparatively minimalistic fashion in how much variety they’ll allow. Instead, the game looks elsewhere for long-lasting depth, since the above is but one piece of the puzzle. In Spelunky, retaining a wealth of idiosyncratic information is far more favorable at proportionately raising your chance at success, and the relatively short list of available equipment is compensated further by emphasizing a higher-than-average skill ceiling in terms of gameplay-oriented attention-to-detail.

To reiterate: every action you take with your character has a pronounced risk-reward curve attached to it, and the same can be said in how you interact with every component (be it fixed in place or not) in a stage. Mismanage your finite resources (bombs + ropes) and you may inadvertently complicate navigation later on. Prolonged exploration may yield lucrative finds, but the timed ghost may impede your path afterwards. Different mobility / offensive options carry their own individual drawbacks. No matter how many examples are brought up, the point of the matter is that Spelunky 2 exhibits a constant flow of micro-considerations, oftentimes tied to the frequent dual purpose of any given mechanics-driven component. Couple this with the straight-forward, but consistently responsive platforming controls, and the way Spelunky 2 sculpted its skill ceiling potential is vastly different from most of its popular contemporaries, confidently crafting its own wholly unique niche.

I admit, this may sound like excessive bloviating, but what I wish to illustrate is that this game feels intensely gratifying. Each frustration I endured when triggering a snowball effect of chaos, was eventually met with vibrant euphoria. The sense of discovery (without using outside guidance) regarding the game's secrets is thoroughly rewarding, thanks to Mossmouth nearly always providing a subtle clue for inquisitive players to internalize. The punitive gameplay repercussions rarely feel unavoidable or unfair, though some things (such as the mole's hurtbox for starters) admittedly could use some minor tweaking. It does not overindulge in itemization to the point that a player’s desire to express their dexterity is far less relevant than raw number (i.e. damage) calculation. Long story short, Spelunky 2 is remarkably rich in long-term gameplay density, yet simultaneously walks a fine line of both being simple to control and to (conceptually) understand.

[h1]Negatives[/h1]
On the flipside, where do Spelunky 2's scant few shortcomings lie? Thankfully, nearly all of them are inconsequential to the gameplay itself, but I do have a short list of 'complaints' I'd like to bring up should the developers ever stumble upon this review:
[list][*]Though I've warmed up to the visuals since its original reveal and now generally view them as a net improvement (especially the overall spritework), some of the presentation (such as the mines' environmental tiles) doesn't look quite as good as before. Other areas (see: jungle) comparatively are more successful at improving visual readability / clarity without sacrificing aesthetic detail.

[*]Eirik Suhrke's soundtrack (while nicely composed) now sounds more ambient compared to the catchier tunes of old and occasionally less varied within a world, partially due to its newfound audio dynamism based on current circumstances.

[*]Subsequently, some of the soundbytes aren't as distinctly recognizable from other sound cues anymore (see: Udjat Eye) or even strangely omitted (a pet reaching a stage exit).

[*]Since the input of running can be configured, I'd like for a toggle to also be included for cape floating. I want an option to mimic its Spelunky 1 behaviour, without altering the current balance justification behind it.

[*]Text boxes don't sufficiently scale according to selected text size. The latter unfortunately means naught when a sizeable portion of the screen still gets obscured, and text box duration is merely a band aid solution.

[*]Daily challenge leaderboards underwent some odd changes I don't exactly agree with. Level progression carrying more weight than money accrued in the [i]score[/i] subcategory sticks out, for example. A quick and dirty solution would be more clear-cut divides in subcategories.

[*]I deeply appreciate the implementation of rollback netcode for the online multiplayer and Mossmouth have already shown on PS4 their intent to continuously enhance it, but basic functionality (lobby options, ping indicators, ...) has strangely been left out at this point in time.[/list]

= Bomb sound is less satisfying then Spelunky HD. Some items' iconic sounds are replaced.
= Music gets a little repetitive with only 1 music per zone. The 3 random songs per zone in Spelunky 1 is reduced to 1 music.

Here are the things I didn't like:
-Floaty controls. It's hard to feel as confident about pulling off a strategic move compared to previous installments.
-Caves have tremendous enemy and trap bloat, on top of new enemies having both 3 hp and fast, hard to dodge attacks.
-The main weapon, the whip, feels worse to use. Not only does it have a smaller hitbox but feels like the animation is way faster so you can't hit enemies mid-air/sprint as consistently.
-Random level generation is far more cruel, with significantly less item spawns and terrain that makes you burn through bombs and ropes very quickly. This makes the previous issues worse because you are forced to fight lots of fast 3 hp enemies in tight choke points.
-The graphics are a downgrade. Less charming than freeware pixel art and far less detailed than the remaster. I imagine the purpose of it was to enhance the clarity of the game, but it deceives previous.

There's probably more things, but I've filed for a refund before hitting the two hour playtime mark.

88,76789320,english,"I'm a huge fan of Spelunky 1.  I have 65 hours in it and have completed many a hell run.   I really enjoyed the game and still play co-op with my siblings/friends sometimes.  I still remember the first time I died to the enemy in the ice area that has no attack except to throw you, and I was unlucky enough to be next to a wall.  It was down right hilarious.

That said, this game is kind of a mess.  It feels like someone played one of those ridiculous mods for Spelunky 1, you know the ones, where it cranks the number of enemies and traps through the roof.  There's just so much going on and the fun playing a focused simple-but-very-hard game is just ... gone.  I think some ideas were great, like adding new enemy and traps, along with the cool new areas, but jamming it all ON TOP of everything from the original leaves it bloated and spammy.  Some examples:

The cave has all the original enemies, PLUS a three health armadillo that jumps/charges you, PLUS a three health mole that can pop out of any wall.  Oh and if you get hit by the scorpion you also get poisoned now, which slowly does damage until you exit the level WITH a pug/cat/mouse.  Why are there multiple enemy types with three health in the first area?  The new enemies are already difficult enough that they deserve one health, but they have three?  Do you really expect me to slowly whittle them down as they go unconscious, wake up for second hit, go unconscious, finally wake up for final hit?  It just slows the game down to a crawl when all we have is the starting whip at that point.  The cave also has the arrow trap of the original, PLUS a tiki trap that does two damage.  You might be saying, ok, well, it's a sequel, things always get more grandiose.  And normally I'd agree, but the player hasn't gotten anything.  We're exactly the same.  4 hp, same whip (which somehow feels like it has a smaller hitbox?), same 4 ropes and 4 bombs.  Same everything.  That means it's a straight (and steep) difficulty increase.

The above is already an issue, as the game has thrown two additional three-health enemies into the fray + poison + another trap, but it's also upped the number of enemies and traps you'll see on the screen.  By a lot.  By a real lot.  It's not uncommon to see 5+ enemies on the screen more than once by the time you've exited the cave.  I've straight up seen four spiders IN A ROW, one after another, on the roof.  I've tried to exit levels with two armadillos, two moles, plus bats and who knows what else.  Yes, that's four three-health enemies on the screen at once in the starting area where you have a whip.  I've seen a vertical tunnel with three arrow traps all right next to one another.  Arrow traps are so common that I spend way more time than I'd like just searching for, picking up, and throwing random items to set off arrow traps.  Once again, destroying the flow of the game.

The areas after the cave are ... actually funner!  I like them a lot!  The lava area only has a few types of enemies and is generally much easier (probably because there aren't arrow traps every three feet) as practically every enemy (minus the mount guy) have one health.  The jungle also has reduced enemies (compared to the cave), though they've changed the spike trap to be 4-directional, blends in, plus a new spiky wall/floor/ceiling thing, plus a bear trap that one shots you.  And even then, it's still funner than the cave.

However, this is quickly undone as the water-based area (one of the third areas) has an enemy that has spikes on its head (like the enemy from hell in Spelunky 1) with a jump + a projectile + charges you.  HUH?!  This is doable without a shotgun...how?  An enemy in the third area is harder than an enemy from the final area previously?

 I just don't understand why the starting area is the most frantic, the most jam packed, with the highest health enemies.  The starting area should have a fast flow with enemies that die quickly.  You spend the most time in the starting area, so it should not be an area that slows or frustrates the player.

There's also areas where you cannot avoid damage, primarily in going through doors.  I found the bee hive in the jungle, went through a door in it, and came out the other door with bees already inside my person.  Like...what?  The whole entering/exiting doors things puts you in situations where you cannot avoid damage.  I've exited a door in the cave and upon exit there is a spider one block above me, which instantly hits me.

This game feels like it was built for two types of people:

1. The people who loved playing the Spelunky 1 mods that added insane amounts of junk to the screen.
2. Streamers.

I'm sure this game is very fun to watch, as you can laugh at your favorite streamer dying to the spider that they can't avoid when going through a door as they're simultaneously pummeled by two moles and an armadillo, all in the first starting area.  However, it's just not as fun to play as Spelunky 1.  It's not tight, it's not focused, it doesn't defeat me by pitting me against difficult situations, it defeats me by spamming me.  I really want to like this game but it just feels so bloated.

To verify my comparisons (and make sure I wasn't looking back with rose-tinted glasses), I went back and played Spelunky 1 just now and man, playing through the first level and barely seeing an arrow trap felt SO GOOD.

94,76788593,english,"Well, Spelunky 2 sure exists.

The original GameMaker Spelunky was the first rogue-like game I ever played, and was probably one of hugest, most defining games of my childhood - the HD remake came out, and I had a blast with it for hundreds and hundreds of hours... But Spelunky 2 just isn't that fun.

The main problem is that Spelunky 2 is trying really, really hard to be a difficult game. It takes the good ol' ""die instantly, but learn from your mistakes"" part of the original Spelunky and takes it to a nonsensical extreme - enemies are everywhere and items are scarce. This would be perfectly fine if the game [i]telegraphed literally anything to the player at all.[/i] Sure, there's plenty of threats where you see them, and you instantly know what you're getting in to. Moles dig through the ground, bear traps punch stuff at their sides, NPCs can go ballistic, etcetera - but the game feels so ludicrously fast compared to the first game (which was already pretty fast), there's barely any time to react if you don't just walk everywhere.

Enemies and traps activate so quickly that your run is just over before you can even process what happened. Arrow trap offscreen at the end of a hallway? Sorry bud, that's two hearts gone! Random dog mount in a lava cave? How [b]dare[/b] you stand in front of it for a single millisecond, that's two hearts gone! Smacked by a lizard? Oops! Looks like you fell in to the pit with 3 other tanky, deadly enemies, good luck! If you so much as accidentally tickle an NPC with the very back of your whip, your run's as good as over. I even died one time because an NPC I hadn't encountered before rewarded me by throwing a key forward, but that key bounced off a wall that generated in front of him and dropped down and hit his turkeys, enraging him. Spelunky 2 leans extremely heavy in to the ""error"" side of trial and error, and contrary to the first game, I feel like half of my deaths were the game's fault thanks to conveyance issues. The new artstyle is... okay... but things like arrow traps and skeletons just blend in to the scenery so much now that I constantly just eat sudden damage if I don't overanalyze every single chunk of scenery. Also, the ghost is back, and is faster now. Great, cool.

There's plenty of new stuff and neat mechanics to behold, but is it really worth it when you're going to be banging your head against a brick wall ten times for every single threat you encounter, with no reward? The game isn't really different enough from the first game to justify suffering through it. Between that and the various patronizing ""wow, I'm learning from my experiences and won't make that mistake again :)"" death messages, the whole game gives off this air of [b]""HAHA GAME HARD = GOOD.""[/b] I don't want to play I Wanna Be The Guy.

Beginning mobs take 3 hits, such as the Horned Lizard, can kill you by comboing you to death no matter how much health you have. The graphical style is atrocious, with low saturation color palettes and a lack of stroking. The effect is enemies and traps are very difficult to see. The player and mob speed is too quick, almost nauseating at a 2 foot distance from a 24"" screen.

This game would've been perfect had it also put in Ultrawide support.  I was confused as to why I didn't see online co-op or pvp in the game but after I read the launch patch notes I understood.  Online MP is definitely tricky so no problem there since we all know it's coming.  Let's just pray it's not a Doom Eternal situation where they promise Invasions and then months down the road never deliver.  We know Derek Yu isn't the type to promise something and then not impress the fans with polish and skill.

This game is essentially a perfect sequel to Spelunky.  The game runs above 60fps and looks beautiful with it's new art style (I wish there was an option to turn on or off the shadow effect from the first game to give it that original look again, or an option to replace the music with OG stage music), and the controls feel even better.  If you're a Spelunky 1 veteran though I'm sure it will take some getting used to, but I like how the sequels new controls and movement feels.  Way smoother and more fluid, it's hard to describe but playing them back to back you'll understand.  The best way I can describe it is your movement and jumping feels way more immediate and less delayed than before, so it comes even closer to those Super Meat Boy levels of perfection.  Honestly, I think this game is at that level.

Otherwise nothing else negative I can say about the game.  It's brutally difficult, I've died in the first area so many times now but I feel like it's a fair challenge to up the ante even more.

Great Job Derek!  Can't wait for Online multiplayer (that one thing missing from Spelunky 1 I always wanted, even Guacamelee! 2 couldn't be bothered to put online multiplayer co-op into their game, that was my biggest disappointment with those developers and that title) and possibly more characters or DLC in the future.

I saw some people played 20 minutes and complained (with negative review) that the game is identical/should-be-a-mod of the first one: this is FAR FAR from the truth. 

If you liked Spelunky 1 you'll love Spelunky 2 (unless you suddenly became uninterested in challenge for some reason)

I'm going to be honest it makes me sad to see negative review with shitty arguments like ""first one runs on my pc but not this one"", ""wip is smaller"", or ""doesn't add anything""

Here is my response to those people, and to the people wondering if there is truth in it:

Gameplay-wise: yes there are some differences with Spelunky 1, the wip feels a bit smaller, but it's hard to know for sure, I'm glad there are differences, it's not the same game

Requirement-wise: yes you need a better specs than spelunky 1 to run spelunky 2, but I mean 7 years between the two, of course requirement went up, it makes total sense. Would you complain that Skyrim needs better spec than Oblivion ? 

Content-wise: there are tons of things that have changed/have been added from spelunky 1, I haven't yet encovered everything, here is what I've seen so far : graphics (visually huge positive changes), multiple path to choose, new monster, new minibosses, new characters, gameplay changes, backrooms connecting parts of the same levels, lots of secret passage and worlds to uncover, level design is completely different

First thing first, the game looks awesome, the new sprites are really crisp and the stages are really pleasant to the eye.
Also for me the game runs at 144fps which makes it even more enjoyable.
The gameplay and game mechanics are really similar to the 1st opus with a lot of new stuff. I only have around 4 hours of gametime so far so I won't dwell on this, I might edit my comment later.
About the difficulty, the game so far seems more difficult that the 1st one. I mean right at stage 1-1 the hostility of the environment is off the charts, with many enemies dealing 2 damages and needing more than a stomp to go down. I was afraid that after beating King Yama several times on the first game, I would maybe progress too smoothly in this one (which would ruin the fun tbh), but so far it seems it won't be the case.
Honestly so far I'm delighted with how the game turned out! A huge congrats to Derek and the team for this amazing work.

97,76780360,english,"I really liked the first Spelunky, which I played when it was a free Gamemaker game. I actually own the Spelunky Wiki, though I haven't done much on it in years. The first remake was worth a buy even if it didn't appeal to a lot of people because it added quite a bit to the overall game. This one, however, doesn't really do enough to stand out as a separate game. It feels more like a mod.

In general, Spelunky 2 feels like a game trapped in 2012, when roguelikes that were based on RNG screwovers were considered good. Thank god we (mostly) got over that. The first game had its share of issues, from the dark levels (which no one liked) to the fact that RNG played a huge part in how successful your run was. I was hoping that Spelunky 2 would fix that, but instead it doubles down on the difficulty while not doing anything to alleviate the issues the first game had.

The first area of the game is now full of enemies that may as well be invincible unless you throw them into spikes. In the first game, this was more or less exclusive to one enemy (the caveman) who didn't always show up. Now you're guaranteed to have full hallways of them, and with Spelunky 2's more compact map design you're generally going to have to fight them in tighter quarters. It also seems like item drops have been severely cut from where they were in the first game, which kind of makes no sense as now everything that isn't on the direct path to the exit more or less requires bombs to access.

Other than that though, this is more or less the exact same game the first one was. The whole ""City of Gold"" chain that starts in the first area is still in, the areas are set up exactly the same as the first game's were (Caves, Jungle, Ice, Lava) and it's just.. too much of the same thing. 

The only way I'd buy this is at a steep discount. Otherwise, just play the first one.

Sadly at the current stage of the game I cannot recommend. The original Spelunky was my all time favorite game so I couldn't wait to play Spelunky 2. However, mid game the FPS will drop down to 2 FPS and it won't accept any input. This is not due to me having bad hardware as I have a 2080 TI, an intel i7 8086K, and 64 GB of RAM. This is something deeper and I have seen other reviews that have the same issues.

The only way to fix this that I have found is to remove battery pack from my controller and reconnect it. This happens every single run though, so it is not just a one off thing. I sincerely hope this gets fixed soon as I really see a lot of potential for this game.

Everything else about this game is excellent. They really upped the difficulty and I can't wait to discover new hidden levels and to experience the new world with my friends online.

I figured that I would return it after an hour and realize ""Oh, it's not worth it."" 150 hours later, I can say pretty confidently that it was. I'm not gonna say that it was some grand revelation, but it tweaked the near-perfect formula, while adding plenty of new features, and it came out as the truly definitive way to play the game. 

I'm barely an hour in Spelunky 2, and I can already feel that same process happening again. The differences between this and the original, compared to the original and Classic, are too numerous to count right now, but the heart of the core gameplay hasn't changed a bit. It still has that systemic, dynamic, risk vs. reward gameplay that the original nailed, but adding more features and tweaks to make it even better. Every single attempt so far taught me about some new interaction, new system, or new technique, and that's almost exclusively in the first area of the game. 

This doesn't reinvent Spelunky, but I feel like this is the new definitive way to play, just like Spelunky HD was before.

37,76777574,english,"Spelunky HD was originally an HD remaster of a game that had the mechanics and set structure of a game that could be played over and over again. The game was popularized by content creators alike and has been one of my personal favorite games of all time.

Going into Spelunky 2, I was praying it wouldn't be just a re-hash of the same concepts / levels from the first game with a ""new"" coat of paint. I've seen sequels by tons of publishers that just can't live up to the hype of the previous game, but I am glad to say that Spelunky 2 has succeeded in my eyes as a perfect sequel to Spelunky HD.

I've been playing the game since it launched on PS4 a little over a week ago now, and I can safely say that this game has both expanded upon both the lore and the creativity that the first game had put in place. There are so many levels to explore, secrets to uncover and hidden objects to find. Even if you think you're good at the original game Spelunky 2 does it's best to humble your own opinion yourself while giving the same Spelunky Rougue-like feel. 

As for the PC port of the game, 
While not having online out the get-go is a rough launch for the game, it was nice of the devs to add a 10% discount onto it and for the promise of not only online play, but cross-platform co-op (let's just pray their servers are better than Nintendos...)! The interface works great and the little bugs / gimmicks from the original HD version have been fixed (one being the issue of getting any other controller other than an XBOX one to work with the game. Thankfully you can now use any steam supported controller in Spelunky 2)

If you are on the edge to buy this game I urge you to drop the 20 bones (assuming you're seeing this after the sale has ended) and get Spelunky 2. It may not be for everyone, but boy does it give you a challenge, as well as a fun time with friends <3",1601406800,1601406800,True,1,0,0.530386745929718018,0,True,False,False,76561198120517542,178,3,375,375,134,1601984302,,

Some spoiler-free differences to the first one that I've noticed in my first two hours of playing local co-op.

> Running is now the default state. Here, you hold RT to walk instead.
> Your fellow players' ghosts cannot trigger traps anymore, but do have a new ability that makes up for it.
> When you pick up a pet (previously damsel), now every player gets +1 to their health.
> Any player can buy things for themselves in a store. The main player doesn't need to purchase ""presents"" anymore.
> This all adds up to feeling like multiplayer was subtly overhauled to feel better and more fair, while still keeping it challenging.
> The art style feels slightly more cartoony? I wasn't sure if I liked it when I saw early screenshots, but in the game it's great. It feels like things read clearer, and there's more life to every motion and design.

I was surprised to find that rather than completely reworking the formula for the new setting and levels, there was a large overlap of mechanics from the first game. You still have the same items, just extra new ones. You still can make sacrifices to Kali, and get the same kinds of rewards. You can still find a key and a chest and get the udjat eye. As such, it almost feels more like an expansion than a full sequel. I'll hold off on saying anything about the new stuff, because a) I haven't gotten further than the second area yet and b) no spoilers! But it's good and it feels exciting and full of potential.

You also cannot just keep a keyboard nearby to press the Tab key to do this mid-game, because the game refuses to allow you to have both available at the same time. In order to use the keyboard bindings, you have to disconnect your controller and maybe even restart the game.

There are workarounds(complete the tutorial with keyboard, or use steam controller settings to change bindings around), however it's kind of silly that you have to do this in the first place.

Spelunky 2     

Where to begin, this is probably the worst game i got, i played through 1 and a half stage, this is truly all the game have to offer me, as i see bullshit eveywhere i turn, especially the traps that shoot arrows, appearing from nowhere. I see people praising this game to be perfect, how so? getting killed 10 times a minute, how is that fun? and lets talk about the bombs for a second, you throw a bomb, it hits the wall, then bounces back to you, hitting you, stunning you for maybe 3 minutes, then some shitty animal or something hits you, or you hit some bone pit spewing out different sort of human bones stunning you and you keep getting stunned, then you are dead, all the time, how is this considered fun? then we have the timer, also spawning a ghost at 3:00 minutes, now lets be honest here, i havent really seen this feature since i keep dying before the timer ends so i guess thats cool, but i picked up a cursed treasure spawning the same ghost, and wtf is this, why cant i fight this one hitting mofo? its unfair and again, not fun.  I guess you could pick up the treasure after you have cleared way to the way out, but why make it so complicated? and again, still not fun

I have a friend, he loves dark souls, probably spelunky 2 too, who knows, but he also loves to be beaten by a whip in bed, how is that fun? Getting beaten by someone with a wip, come  on man.. i mean, this game is pretty good looking i have to admit, but after a couple minutes, you start to feel how annoying and shitty this game truly is overshadowing that fantastic look. This is the kind of game angry video game nerd would have reviewed if youtube would come out in 2030, trust me, everyone would agree this would have been a true time waster in a negative way. 

If you ask me, get this game only if you like having a bad time, if you like to die a lot, all the time, or if you are the kind of human that loves to feel miserable.

We just want to make this clear to our players so that they can refund the game if that doesn't meet their expectations. Otherwise it would be very unfair to buy a game, play it for a while then be unable to refund it if an update breaks the game in your setup.

- I tried to hold onto a ledge while holding a haunted vase. Accidentally dropped the vase, and then Olmec's wife proceeds to ""sue"" me for the damages
- I tamed a wild turkey, you can mount it and it gives you double-jump and gliding. Then a man proceeds to ambush and murder me with his bow because I ""stole"" the turkey from him
- I bought a present box from a shopkeeper. I open it, and see a used beartrap... Did I really just spend 8800 dollars for something as useless as a rock?! In anger, I throw the beartrap at him... It opens up, he instantly shoots at me, the trap snaps, and then his shop explodes because somebombs got snapped in the trap. Nobody was left alive.
- I fought the giant tribal man, throwing skulls and vases at him. He proceeds to destroy half of the level. There is nothing else I can throw at him so I try to escape. Then he proceeds to crush another haunted vase... Ghost on one side, giant rolling boulder-like man on the other... ""We'll be right back"".

https://youtu.be/KVZNRHYPMX4 [/h1]

I have played a ton of Spelunky 2 on the PS4 and in my experience it is a perfect sequel. Enough to get me to buy the game twice.

Spelunky 2 takes everything that made the original so great and influential and reinvents the entire world. Spelunky 2 also manages to be harder than the original even though it shares a lot with the first game.

So as an example, the first 4 sections of the caves are extremely similar to the first 4 sections of the original Spelunky. So you would think that people like myself that played Spelunky would just be able to breeze past it all. But that is not the case at all. And the reason being is that although you might have your snakes and bats and caveman and some of the same traps from the first game you also have a ton of new things waiting to kill you.

You have groundhog things that bury themselves underground and then pop out and attack you, you have little creatures that roll into balls and try to fly at you, you have new tiki traps, and so you have to learn the game again even if you spent hundreds of hours in the first Spelunky. 

And I personally really, really like that because honestly it would be kind of boring if I could breeze through the first part of the caves in like 5 minutes when I have been waiting for this sequel for about 8 years.

And so although the first part of the game feels a little similar to the original Spelunky once you get past that the game starts getting a lot more different. Instead of just always having the jungle after the caves you now have branching paths. So you can either go to the jungle like you normally would or you can now go to this lava area. 

And beyond all the new enemies and traps, the world just feels so much more alive. There is a ton more variety in the shops, you now have hidden caves you can go in that are like caves within caves, you have animals that you can attempt to mount that give you bonuses, there are a ton of new items and secrets and ultimately it is just a crazy good sequel.

So I am sure I will still be discovering new secrets this game has to offer in about 100 hours because that is the type of game Spelunky 2 is and that makes me extremely happy.",1601389270,1601389329,True,11,0,0.585238635540008545,0,True,False,False,76561198061548222,704,91,60,60,60,1601388888,,

It's more Spelunky in every way, all the best ways! It feels the same, so your skills from the first game will mostly translate over, and while there is a lot more density to the levels and most every thing is just a little different in some way (I mean, spiders are the same as before, but look much better), it's comfortable and amazing and just incredibly massive. There are so many more worlds, secrets, items, enemies, traps, and more to uncover and learn to deal with. 

The art and visuals have been a source of debate for a long time now, but from the moment I had it before me on my big TV (and now on my g-sync display) I was in love. This game is gorgeous. Flat out gorgeous. Everything from items and enemies to textures and backgrounds looks cleaner, more detailed, and wonderful. It may well be that seeing it in a static image or in motion on a compressed medium such as YouTube or Stream doesn't do it justice, but when you are playing it and the dynamic lighting is working and the backdrop is parrallaxing, oh boy does it work. So well. Art being subjective, I wouldn't blame someone for not agreeing, but at least see it in person before judging. 

I have seen a lot of this game, but from hints I've picked up and various comments and YouTube video titles I get the feeling I'm still barely scratching the surface. I thought nothing could unseat Spelunky until I played some really great rogue-lites such as Slay the Spire, Monster Train, and Hades - and those are all amazing games worth checking out, don't get me wrong, but Spelunky 2 swoops in and reminds me why this franchise is the king. 

A final note on difficulty; Spelunky was hard. Spelunky 2 is harder. It is still (mostly) fair, and rewards those that put time and effort into learning it's mechanics and how to make good choices second by second, but there will be many times and many early hours when you feel like the game is just ""such bullshit"" and your impulse will be to give up and refund it. Don't.  Stick with it. Put some time into it around lunch every day, I swear everyone can learn to get better and better at this one, and even if you never ""beat"" it, just having a run that lasts like 25 minutes and is full of wonder and holy-shit moments is worth every moment of your time.

This doesn't mean that the game won't work on Windows 7 but that any patch can break Windows 7 compatibility and it may take days to fix.

We want to make this clear to our players so that they can refund the game if that doesn't meet their expectations. Otherwise it would be very unfair to buy a game, play it for a while then be unable to refund it if an update breaks the game in your setup.

This may change in the future once the remaining features and fixes are done."
