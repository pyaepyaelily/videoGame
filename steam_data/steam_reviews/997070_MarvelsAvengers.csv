5,77166454,english,"Maybe I will have to edit this review once this game gets updated. As it stands now, I simply can not recommend this game to anyone in my right mind. Let's get the good things out of the way first:
1. I really like the combat. They got the feels right for every character.
2. Kamala Khan is the heart and soul of this story. Unlike many ""reviewers"" not a single moment came off to me as cringy or anything like that. Without her, this story wouldn't have worked. And I like that Crystal Dynamics tried to tell a different story than all the other Avengers media we have received in the past.
Let's talk about the bad things now which there are very many of:
1. Absolutely horrid performance and crashing issues. I had to finish this game on my PS4 where I received it for free. It seems like CD had no idea how much destruction and particle effects to budget for and went crazy with it. This game would have been so much fun for the combat alone playing by yourself or with friends. This is fixable in the future. I understand with Covid and remote work and everything they couldn't really do anything with the initial delay. But they should have delayed the game even more because the game's name is already tarnished. And it doesn't really come up with a massive graphical improvement from past games like Crysis to make this kind of performance fair.
2. Low flight ceiling.
3. Lifeless environment and same regions, same enemies over and over again.
Now I could talk about the bad things about this game all day. But I don't really have the time or patience to do that. Many have already done that and I think SkillUp put it the best on his review on YouTube. Another game could have been made here. But I should mention that I don't really care about microtransactions as I am not really eager to buy recolored skins. But I do like the fact that we are getting additional story content as free DLC for years to come funded by that. I like this approach. I also like that gears don't change the look of the character, I personally hate that in other games. I also think that the loot system is very much tacked on this game that didn't really need one. I do think this game has the potential to become great in the future.",1602057720,1602057720,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198310608058,88,13,557,120,557,1601742871

Bought the deluxe version and really just played under 5 hours and really am tired of it already.

The game itself seems overly simple - and unfortunately becomes stale pretty quickly.

Visually the game is really great, the recordings are pretty cool and Kamala's intro was interesting but all of that was just following a story around.

Breakdown of my comparison above:
LOTR - 4 v waves of people, attack/defend/RUN away
LEGO - There really isn't any 'failure' that is available, you might roll back to the last checkpoint - but really isn't too brutal as a whole
Warframe - Wartable is very similar to the console and you have to build each of your characters similar to warframes

26,75936871,english,"Once you get past this game's eye candy, you very quickly realize there is no variety in available maps to play on, but more importantly, you realize that the gameplay design is very poorly thought out. Dealing with ranged attackers is simply infuriating, driving you to a level of frustration where you just can't help but request a refund. It is a complete mess. Many ranged attacks disrupt the flow of melee combat (e.g. homing missiles and sniper attacks), and simultaneously you will find yourself helpless in dealing with the sources of those ranged attacks.

The tutorial for playing this game occurs after you have played the campaign. I went from level 1 through 48 on the Hulk without even realizing that I had to hit dodge twice in order to avoid red area-of-effect attacks from bosses and sub-bosses. In many instances, I had to resort to exploitative tactics, such as throwing debris at the Abomination boss, because my character, Hulk, had no success in dodging most of his attacks.

Often times, attacks you are supposed to parry or dodge occur so insanely fast that you don't have time to react.

One of the worst flaws of the game is that your success weighs on the relative levels of the characters on your team. This is a multiplayer game that is designed for matchmaking, afterall — and yet matchmaking is broken for just about everybody. However, if you play with AI teammates, the AI teammates will always default to level 1 if you have only leveled up the character you are playing with, which is an extreme likelihood.

Okay, I had to change my review, and I'm going to leave the positive rating, but I'm going to warn people about this game also.

WARNING: REVIEW BEFORE PURCHASE

This game is great graphically. I had issues with some of the mechanics, and still do. Hulk needs I-frames. The transition from flying to fighting for those characters that fly is glitchy. Attack indicators are bad in this game. 

But the real no no, is that multiplayer is completely broken. The game crashes 30 minutes in. Doesn't so much on solo play though. And you have people who have paid for stuff and have not been compensated, and etc. 

It's a hot mess of a game, but it does get the feel of the characters right in a lot of ways once you learn how to play. It's just supposed to be a multiplayer game, which is the only thing that would help ignore the lack of content until they can release some DLC, but we can't even get that. Then turn around and hear they're getting patches to console, and moving right along, and the PC community has all but died because they can't connect.  Could connect somewhat at first, until the patch everyone was so overjoyed with that broke that completely. 

I'd say buy it if you're willing to wait and hope they get their heads out of their asses, and decide to give us our money's worth. Or, just put it on a wishlist for later review, but as it is right now, I don't even play anymore. You could play solo, but the enemies ignore your A.I. comrades and your A.I. comrades ignores everything. And this game isn't designed to be played with one character, but that's what you get when you do solo runs. 

So, yeah, purchase at your own risk and frustration.",1599311017,1602004433,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198068027147,51,2,10104,2458,9635,1602082378

Its not without its issues but its nothing that can't be easily addressed with all the updates that will be coming.

Update: I really wanted this game to be good but right now its just isn't. The enemy AI is bad, they go from 1 hit kill easy to a damage sponge that you'll spend 30 minutes hitting just to die in 1 hit from them. There is no content, once you finish the main story which is amazing that's pretty much it. The missions can be fun, after a while it gets old.

I get multiple CTD's per day. I won't go into detail to keep the review shorter, but my specs are significantly above recommended. I must run the game on ""low"" to reduce the number of CTD's. The game has a lot of pacing problems as it pertains to the hero advancement. Reviews have criticized the heroes as playing like cheap knock-off versions of the heroes and without playing a level capped character in really solid gear this criticism is entirely justified.

If you were to try to play each hero while experiencing the main campaign you will cap out your heroes at around level 12-14 which will mean each hero is missing 36-38 skill points (almost their entire kit and all of their synergies). Given that the campaign runs around 12 hours, that's a long time to play heroes at the level most ARPGs move you out of in the first 30 minutes. On the other hand, once you hit level cap with all of the heroes and start optimizing your gear there's a real gem of gameplay here. You have six heroes with completely different playstyles, each with multiple of their own unique and completely viable builds. Once you hit level cap and start getting gear with item perks that cater to your playstyle the game really starts to come to life in the combat area. I just wish there was more endgame content. Currently, there's only AIM bots and four bosses: Taskmaster, Abomination, AIM Warship, and the giant AIM robot. Definitely needs some diversity. A lot of people have been comparing it to Anthem and I just don't think it's a correct comparison because Anthem was samey and not particularly fun to play.

The campaign tells an original story and contains a lot of references to both the MCU and Marvel comics.

ORIGINAL REVIEW: I was ready to be disappointed with this game but instead was very pleasantly surprised.   The combat is similar to Arkham/Shadow of Mordor but a little more forgiving and tweeked for multiplayer.  I recommended this game to a couple friends and my wife, and while they thought I was a fool they also trust me and bought it.  Now we are all hooked!

I really really hope they keep bringing in more heroes and bad guys.  I know Square Enix said they would all be free but honestly I would gladly pay for some more diversity in the roster and in the mission design (though both are a lot of fun as is).

The main story line is fun and the dialogue is better than I had expected even if it does have some extra cheesy moments.  

I would recommend this game to anyone who likes Destiny style games, WB Studios type combat and Marvel.

The only problems I have with this game is that even though you can customize each character's skills and abilities, the combat is very repetitive. Just because the bots are derivative of one another and attack the same every time. The skill points would actually mean something if you could have more variation with the AI and the enemy types in general. And that is a major con for a game this high-priced. 

I still, however, would recommend this game because if you're a marvel fan there's really no other good choice out there for a video game like this one in terms of characters, scale, and storyline.

There was a major patch that made a game that was unplayable for many people even worse.  I had no issues before the patch, but afterwards run into issue after issue.  Another patch was eventually released, and now, for me, at least, the game runs well.  But I have a pretty decent system, so, who knows how well it for run for others?

Sadly, the release of nearly unusable product, and taking nearly a month not to fix it, but just get it playable at all, has made the multiplayer portion of the game, which the game was really banking on, a ghost town.  Once you finish the main story, which thankfully you can do alone, there's not much point in playing.  It's designed to be played with other people, has teamwork mechanics, and the AI companions for soloing the group content is...  pretty bad.

I thought Square Enix had learned with Final Fantasy XIV and the terrible launch and subsequent financial disaster.  I thought the gaming industry had learned from the numerous games as a service releases that were nearly unplayable and as a result completely bombed.  Apparently, they have not.  

I played the campaign and loved it.  I still feel bad that I bought it, because I feel like it only encourages companies to continue to release unfinished games.

Avoid unless you got it for free.

[u]Why?:[/u]
- [u]Buggy mess[/u] : Right now, the game has tons of bugs and technical issues involve many things, Graphics, VFX, SFX, etc. and Major ones too that would directly effect Gameplay experience. 

- [u]Nauseating Camera works[/u] : The game often takes control of the camera away from the player. In various situations to the point of Nausea induce. (for examples, [u]ex1)[/u] Range attack has a 'Zoom in' effect. during the combat if you switch between Melee and Range often you'll feel the effect sooner or later. [u]ex2)[/u] Navigating around the map. The camera would try to Turn somewhere it 'think' you would want to look. Like when moving off the ledge the Camera would do 180 turn and look down for you Every. Frickin. Time. No options to turn this feature off at the moment.

-[u][b]Matchmaking[/b] time : Looooooooooooooooooooooong [/u] Not only that it is [u]Super Buggy, Very Frustrate induce[/u] Often result in player waiting in Matchmaking, [u]Unable to Launch the mission[/u] Had to return to the ship (which of course More Loading) and access war table again to make it work. It's so bad. [b]Barely Functional at all.[/b] but [i][u]inviting friends seems to work somewhat.[/u][/i]

-[u]Live Service and Peer to Peer[/u] : Maybe because the game is Live service and almost everything have to connect to server these add delays on many actions in the game. After you connect to a lobby and start the game, it seems to be a P2P connection to the host player. When you play with someone who has poor connection one of you will get a very bad lagging experience. and will encounter all sort of bugs.

-[u][b]EXCLUSIVES[/b][/u] : many items in the game were locked away for Exclusivity. Exclusive skins from this and that product, Exclusive Emotes, Exclusive Hero Character. wow. The data is in the game but [i]""Sorry, you can't have it.""[/i]

My only critique of the campaign was that it did not last long enough.

Once I completed the campaign I began playing the Avenger's Initiative which is the game's multiplayer. When I started, I had fun leveling up my heroes and unlocking new abilities to combo together. But, after some time in the game's multiplayer it slowly devolved into a monotonous buggy mess. The game's multiplayer matchmaking hardly works as I have played 95 percent of this game solo. When I did find other random players the matches would not start. Matchmaking is so broke that I cannot even play more than 1 game with a friend on Steam. The game is filled with vast amounts of bugs varying between annoying animation glitches to completely halting gameplay progression. It also suffers from not enough mission variety and objectives.

However the campaign just reaches a point where it completely devolves into the multiplayer missions, and story gets pushed aside to voice recordings describing what you're doing as you endlessly fight enemies in different areas. The combat was fun when it was solo heroes vs a couple enemies where you had to dodge/think about what you were doing. But once you get into the full fledged combat, with 4 players and 500 enemies constantly shooting lasers and projectiles at you that knock you back with little (or absolutely no) warning, it sucks. It's not fun. Imagine playing Smash Bros but every attack takes 3 seconds to wind up, and any attack against you stuns you and cancels your action. There is no balance in this game. Difficulty and hero selection simply do not matter. You can select your difficulty, but it will match you with other players who selected a lower difficulty so you are completely overpowered for the mission and don't even have to try. Adversely, increasing the difficulty doesn't really change the enemy behavior, it just increases how much you're completely spammed with damage, and the only way to mitigate it is to increase your stats with gear.

At first progression seemed cool, however I eventually realized it was just one of those systems that takes abilities that make your character actually fun and rips them away from you and makes you level up to access them. Until you unlock each first tier upgrade, you're stuck spamming X or Y, no combos allowed. THEN you can start getting interesting upgrades that change stats, and how your abilities/combos work. Rinse and repeat for all characters, if you want to play that long.

Gear doesn't bother me. I've seen a lot of complaints about how it works, but I'm not bothered by increasing numbers, or lack of cosmetic change from them. I like the idea of trying to complete a mission for a fancy piece of loot that will give me some cool stats. The problem is in this game there's nothing that I want to work for. If I got that fancy piece of gear, who cares? What am I going to do with it? I don't enjoy the combat anymore, the difficulty of missions are a complete gamble, and the effects of the gear probably won't be felt anyway, among the complete chaos of combat.

The game looks fantastic. Some of the prettiest, most realistic looking environments in recent games I've played. It runs just fine on my system, but I have a beefy PC. Can't complain about the graphics. I did have 2 separate crashes, which was rather annoying.

The writing/acting in story missions are pretty good. The writing/acting in multiplayer missions is atrocious. It's unbelievable. I think if I hear (Deadpool pretending to be) Tony Stark saying ""plebs"" one more time, I will have an aneurysm. Almost everything that Stark says is annoying. Not like ""haha oh that Tony always bein a rascal"" annoying, like ""WHO APPROVED THIS DIALOGUE LIKE IT'S TUMBLR IN 2011?"" annoying.

Matchmaking is bad. Not only do the bad reviews steer people away from playing, but also there are over 100 missions, each with 4 difficulties, a huge range of hero power levels, and you can't be matched with someone who has your hero selected. So you have to wait a long LONG time to find people who match that criteria, and who won't leave within 3 seconds. (Remember, people have the attention span of hamsters) Most likely, unless you have friends who also unfortunately bought this game, you will be playing with very dumb AI teammates. Might as well just play Overwatch HEYO

When I came to the realization around 2014 that we hadn't had any full fledged Marvel games beyond stupid mobile games, I was very hopeful we'd get an open world coop Marvel game where everyone had a role to fill and you could feel like the Avengers with your friends. I was very excited because I thought this game would at least partially deliver that experience. I had a rush of fun at first when I finally got to play as each hero, but it quickly changed to disappointment and buyer's remorse. Frankly, I had a lot more playtime and a LOT more fun in Fallout 76.",1601782143,1601782214,False,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False,76561198045697543,242,17,1543,36,1543,1601612424

I didn't buy this game because I wanted to play as a little girl at a comic book convention. I couldn't even finish due to how awkward it felt. Someone please let me know when a real passionate studio like insomniac makes an avengers style game. There is a group of people who have more patience than I and might be able to put up with all the hoops to actually find things to enjoy, but comparing this to the Marvel movie universe-  there is a major difference in quality and I won't accept this. The game took years of development and they didn't even put in hawkeye at release, have at least 10 characters at release, made a hero a console exclusive, lack of different locales and open world design, and didn't obtain rights to likeness of the heroes I spent a decade getting to know in the films.

Review edit as of release day: I have not crashed after 45ish minutes of game play. It seems that has been resolved. The controls seem to have improved slightly since I last played, but I'd welcome further improvements. I have not experienced another memory leak. I wish I had PTO so I could play more.

This review was written on day one of early access. In the two weeks since closed beta, the game has improved dramatically.
The devs are listening, and actively accepting feedback, so here's mine. (Please note these complaints may have been fixed. I'm unable to post my review until the game is released. I may update it.)

At the time of the review, I've made it through the campaign to the sewers (less of a spoiler than you think.)

- Controls are awkward (dodging and jumping is NOT fluid and is quite aggravating, especially on Hulk/Iron Man).
+ Characters are relatable.
+/- The prologue had me in goosebumps. The rest of closed beta did not.
+ The story telling is good, really good.
+ Lots of collectables, which offer stat boosts (would be cool if we could read the comics. Maybe I haven't unlocked that function yet?)
+/- Characters have similar personalities to the movies, and are likable, but the animations in the cinematics are clunky.
-/ + So far... the story moves a bit too fast, but that's a literary critique. Also subjective.
- I'm having connection issues with Enix's servers, though until my game crashed with no errors generated, this didn't seem to be an issue.
+ I was indifferent about Kamahla Kahn until I played this game. I like her. I can relate.
- Devs, please please please create an automated crash report function. This is hyper critical to ever game made, especially for pay to play betas. Users frequently don't know how to properly explain a bug. Gamer =/= programmer.

43,76743637,english,"Not recommended at this time. The game badly needs patching to make it more stable. It should not have gone to market before more play-testing. 

Before reviewing the game itself, the stability and bug issues need addressed. The first time I launched the game it locked my PC completely forcing a hard reboot. Since then it has numerous crashes to desktop, often right after a long slog of content that now needs repeated. My character has become 'invisible' to the game several times where I cannot deal or receive damage but also cannot activate required items like 'stand in this circle' objectives. Enemies have dropped below the map, forcing a restart of the mission. The game's stability has improved with patches but still dies alarmingly often. 

The game itself is solidly okay. The graphics are good and the voice acting is stunning. Movie quality voice work here. Kamala is the best character Marvel has put on offer. She plays extremely realistic from her fan-girl beginnings to blind optimism of youth. Bruce Banner carries guilt like a heavy burden even for the Hulk's shoulders to bear. Sadly, the rest of the cast is somewhat overlooked. Stark is quippy but quickly loses his trademark arrogance. Thor has a couple good lines that reflect the movie character well. Overall just watching the cutscenes would be as entertaining as the actual movies. 

But the game lets down in actual game play. The limited move combos tend to play the same. Melee is melee, and ranged is ranged. Light, Light, Heavy...regardless of who you play. It looks different for each character but you will quickly find yourself just going thru the motions on the controller with all the cast. 
Easily the most frustrating game I have ever played. The difficulty level is broken with even on the easiest level enemies can wipe out your health bar almost instantly. EASY in this game is BRUTAL on any other game. It's as if the devs simply made it one difficulty and just give you the illusion of choice. 

Some mechanics seem spotty. Like holding towards an enemy and holding B should perform a flip over shield opponents but works about 1 in 4 attempts, leaving you to get smashed as the game simply doesn't respond. Same for dodge/parry which seems to work only when it wants to. You will confidently press buttons to execute a dodge or parry, only to have your character stand there and take the hit. 
Worst is the camera though. Perhaps the worst camera in any brawler I've played. It is so close to your character that you lose all situational awareness and often the camera glitches as it is 'inside a wall' when you get close to one. Dodge and parry are essential yet you cannot see attacks coming from behind or above. This crushes gameplay for characters like Black Widow who's power relies on not getting hit or the power bar resets. Some indicators of incoming attacks helps, but isn't very precise and you will take hits from enemies you didn't know where there. The camera needs to be backed off some distance so you can respond to attacks from behind or above. Add to this the over use of 'effects' on screen and it just results in total chaos. In big fights you can barely tell whats going on, who to attack, and who is damaging you. Enemies teleport-- but there is a huge ball of light when they do. Remember those warning about the flashing screen and epilepsy? Well if you didn't already suffer from it you will after playing this game. It is so unnecessary and distracting. The devs clearly made all these characters and enemies individually to look cool and have effects but when you have dozens of them on you at once-- you simply can't even tell what is going on. 
Even on the easiest difficulty you can only take a few hits while some enemies take a dozen or more. This is an issue when the screen is filled with 20 enemies. Having to pound on one to finish it off becomes a chore when the rest of the baddies are all gunning at you. 
Too many enemies have a single method of defeating, and it becomes rote repetition to fight them. Even with 20 enemies on screen, there is only about 4 different types that require specific moves to defeat. 
There is very little variety to the maps. There is desert, lab, and corridor for the most part. You will see these same locations over and over again. 

Multiplayer is serviceable enough but matchmaking is very hit or miss. It gets super repetitive compared to the campaign though. I expect that will expand with DLC however. 

Overall this is a decent game but incredibly frustrating at times, as long as it isn't bugging out or crashing. Not the AAA experience I had hoped for given a billion dollar franchise. With some patching and expansions in DLC it could improve but just doesn't blow you away like expectations were built up for. The difficulty settings need a total overhaul. Even using the easy difficulty just to get thru the campaign seems to make no difference and the game is brutally hard regardless. Not the fun kind of difficulty either, the frustrating sort where you don't know what to do, and the screen is total chaos.",1601348566,1601703514,False,2,0,0.495495498180389404,0,True,False,False,76561198031613830,82,35,1785,1245,1182,1602044828

All walls were invisible and even when having settings to the lowest quality and 30fps it was still invisible and laggy.

1. Terrible optimization and tremendous amount of bug waiting for fix.
2. Outside the main campaign, there is no enjoyable content, that 5 hours campaign simply isn't worth of 60 USD.
3. End game gameplay content is basically repetitive ""mega hive"" consisting of 40 floors of robot enemies and reward your a chunk of gears weekly. Yep, 40 floors of robotic enemies with little variety in the same room layout.
4. Terrible grind: The perks on gear are totally rng-based and can't be changed. After 3 weeks of mega hive I can't even gear one character properly, and exotic gears drop rate is totally abysmal. Such RNG scares people away from grinding upcoming characters.
5. Lack of immersive endgame content: Being a marvel-titled game, you don't find any cool villain to beat: all the end game content is the same robotic enemies with different elemental affixs. The only 2 named villains are Taskmaster and Abomination and they don't show up in any end-game tasks (hive and vault missions).

Flight feels akward. Cosmetics arent all that good either, some are cool however but they are very expensive. I havent tried the multiplayer part since none of my friends wanted to buy the game, and i do understand that. Its waaay too expensive for what it is, and that makes it hard to convice people to actually get it. Personally i havent encountered any bugs yet, so that is a good thing in my book. However as a die hard Avengers fan, i did kinda like it. Like i said it has some huge flaws, but its still an avengers game, and this is the only game of its sort (Avengers wise) I did like the campagin, even though it felt really short, and not really replayable. And it did for sure have its moments. Hopefully they add onto it with (free) DLC. I do not thing paid DLC's would be worth it for this game sadly. 

The only reason i did get this however is because of the ""Marvel"" brand. If this was any other brand, i wouldnt even touch it with a 10 feet pole. I would however recommend it if you love Marvel and The Avengers. But id wait untill it goes on a sale, because its definitly not worth the original price.

The only one that wasn't my favorite was Iron Man as I felt his combat was a little wonky. It doesn't help that he can't really heal himself much.

Something I would have prefered with the campaign is if you always returned to either the Helicarier or the Ant Hill after each mission rather than only when the story wants you to. That and if playing a mission in singleplayer mode if you could switch between the different characters, but I guess it's meant to encourage more online play, because some chests or rescues are locked behind things that only some characters can open, and if you aren't playing one of them then you would have to replay the mission to get it. My favorite to play was Black Widow though.",1601595465,1601595465,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198129815035,93,6,1200,1200,1200,1601594736

I only wish the project goes well cause new maps, new heroes, new villan heroes - we wait it all!! 
Overall - enviroment, very nice - playability - ok, mission with +100 levels appears as daily so omfg, but lets give the developers some time to handle these ""flies"", - maybe more campaign mods / possibilities would be nice (like repeat with different character? or higher difficulty? another storyline? - lets hope). I cannot imagine levelling up all heroes simultaniously to have own offline team but patience is the key so far and heroes are made too ""adequate"" - I liked old marvels heroes whjere some heroes were more rare than others and ofcourse stronger - hulk seems squishy for hulk, so daoes thor as god of thunder but lets hope developers will patch and remake some stuff more to our expectations..

Not necessarily story wise, but the opening scene/gameplay was very slow and I didnt particularly like switching amongst players in the middle or at the end of combat, so I put it to the side for quite sometime.

92,76116914,english,"This game imo could go in one of two directions, anthem or destiny, it's kinda hard to say right now. At the moment it's an early looter-shooter with all that that entails. Looter shooter fans are a hard to please bunch so it's not going to be easy but it's already got one of the most important things, a steady drip of dopamine from the core gameplay which is pretty fun. The game this most compares to is obviously destiny so that's what i'm measuring it against, might be kind of long.

Performance: 
Based on what I've seen playing this on both my home rig & laptop, I think most people should be able to easily run this above 60fps if not 100+fps. On older setups it's possible you might have to sacrifice some settings but if you're already playing destiny for example, this runs about the same. It seems pretty well optimized. 

Pros:
The msq is unexpectedly good, like, bungie needs to be taking notes good, the campaign alone is well worth the price of the game. many things are familiar if you've played other looter shooters & while they definitely copied some things, imo they improved on many of them. overall mechanics, gear & build diversity are all pretty good for a game this new. the characters are pretty diverse, so most people will probably find at least one that they like. As expected there's a cash shop but bc the game is constantly handing you currency, it's probably one of the easiest games i've seen to get cash shop items for free (besides maybe warframe). The game lets you alter your skill tree at any time, mid-combat if you want. My personal favorite thing is you can use your other characters as companions, like, you're running a nightfall as your warlock with your hunter & titan.

Cons:
As expected the endgame is kind of thin rn, but destiny was the same way at launch so I'll be fair & update this later. it's currently extremely grindy in the endgame... right now it takes way too long to get a decent enough build, not to mention gear, on just one single character to see what said character can actually play like. The difference between a character at lvl 1 & lvl 50 is a complete night/day. Realistically, for most people without a ton of time on their hands & bc of how long this takes, they're only really going to be able to have one character that's geared up for endgame content. Also, right now there's no way to replay the campaign that i know of.

TLDR:
Basically I only picked this up bc there's nothing left for me to do in destiny until november, I wasn't expecting much but was pleasantly surprised by its potential... I think if square/crystal just keeps adding content, this could actually be what its trying to be. so far the dev's have been much quicker than what I'm used to seeing with the bug-fixes and updates, & the content lineup they have planned looks good so we'll see... as a big fan of looter-shooters, some titles I love have lazily sat on top for way too long & it has done them exactly zero favors, so I'd be happy to see a newcomer shake things up a bit. also, importantly this game has a crispy fresh new engine compared to its competitors, unlike destiny's 8-year old spaghetti code that hasn't changed much since destiny 1, or warframe (although tbf warframe's engine has been completely overhauled as well as upgraded graphically several times unlike destiny's). this one is brand new & it feels like it.",1600346389,1601577051,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197972060888,163,35,7454,6981,5524,1602076506

-Nice graphics, 
-Cool story (i like the boss fights), 
-Great introduction on every Hero, 
-Great combat system, brings some Heroic immersions. 
-Each Hero has his own learning curve and different combos to muscle memorize yourself. ----Enemies are pretty interesting and have lots of nice abilities to hurt you with. You really need to pay attention when to attack and be prepared to dodge/parry, combined with your skills it feels very rewarding.

Cons: 
-Lots of bugs (latest patch fixed crashes and bugs for me), 
-Some minor stuttering on loading screens
-Missions have variations but they feel very generic
-Landscapes are poorly designed, nothing to admire or feel awe. 
-Matchmaking system needs rework, you can't find players like in Destiny.

97,76869377,english,"First of all I want to say that the reviews aren´t fair in my opinion and this game deserves more attention. Let me explain why: 
I had been hyped months before release, but when it finally came out I wasn´t able to play for the first two weeks because of too high CPU usage (had above minimum specs). That was fixed in Patch V1.3. and the `long` wait was worth it. I really see me with hundred hours of playtime on this. 
One important thing, which haters complain about: It has nothing to do with the MCU, it´s a completely new story with inspiration from the comics.

cons:
- still some performance issues and bugs
- Spiderman Playstation exclusivity 
- the iconic missions would had been better if they were actual iconic solo missions imo, e.g. for Black Widow a spy mission, now the only thing that make them iconic are the skins you get by finishing

pros:
- original, amazing (but short) story with movie-like cutscenes
- every character feels like it should, for example Hulk is very destructive, Kamala just kicks and punches everything without a fighting style and with Thor you feel the power of Mjolnir when enemies can´t stand up while the hammer is on them... however, they all play themselves differently from each other
- huge, detailed maps with secret places to explore 
- quite realistic graphics
- skilltrees are really one of my favorite things in game, the longer you play a hero the more moves/combos/abilities/animations you unlock, also later you can choose between skills and define your playstyle
- all upcoming DLCs and expansions will be free (except Spiderman as I mentioned before)
- many cosmetics, some are achieveable, some cost money (but you can also save credits from the hero cards for them)
- multiplayer is fun, especially with friends
- gear and level system (similar to Destiny)

The multiplayer side isn't as much fleshed out yet(and you really need to play it with friends to get the most out of it), but there's plenty of new content already in the works for both sides. 

The reason why I recommend you buy the game now is that doing so will give you more time to grind the required points for the future content so you can unlock it for free right when it arrives. You can still unlock it for free afterwards too, these point grinds aren't behind expiring battle passes etc. (EDIT: BUY THE GAME NOW AT YOUR OWN RISK, more details below).

The game is very heavy on the hardware, and I recommend you upgrade into the RTX3000 series GPU's or AMD's equivalent once those come out if you want to get the most out of the graphics. Right now a 2080ti is not enough to run everything smoothly on ultra settings and high resolutions. There's still a fair amount of bugs in the game too but the fixes are arriving with decent speeds.

Samsung 860 EVO 500GB SSD for teh Windows 
Windows 10 Pro

EDIT: An update to my review after playing the game for 102 hours. 

The stability and gameplay experience on my end has only improved with the patches the game has had, but I know some people have different experiences and I've been lucky. 

The endgame content after the campaign ends is very repetitive and simple, and feels just like a bonus mode after finishing the campaign instead of being an actual fully fleshed out multiplayer side of the game. 

This is due to the way the game launched too early, just a one month delay would have made a big difference. More content is coming soon, and so are more patches. Even so, if you buy the game now, you might be one of the unlucky ones who get hit with a progression stopping bug. 

Encountering a cheater if you play with online randoms is also going to corrupt your game save and you'll need to restore an earlier backup save. This might even require you to go into the game folders to rename some files as sometimes the corruption is so bad the game won't let you launch it, so you can't access the save restoration from the in-game menus. This is a problem which affects many online co-op games and is not likely going to be fixed, so you'll just have to learn how to restore your saves if you want to play with randoms online.",1599302352,1601555112,True,2,0,0.516192972660064697,0,True,False,False,76561197985958631,218,23,6760,1351,6126,1601958350

[h1] I played this game for 308 hours. Let's EDIT this review! [/h1]
[url=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_TZKtuTia_JysP79Tzd9SFfrpxXRip0JAo0fX4GBaIA/edit?usp=sharing] Original Review Here. [/url].

[b] Note: [/b] 
You will see a bunch of negative comments in this review. I actually have a positive feeling for this game. I did actually enjoy my experience in the story and in multiplayer. This review is intended as an Objective Review, but you might see a few Subjective opinions scattered in here. The edits on this review will continue to be made as we progress forward, some might be bigger and more expansive edits given time.

[b] The Campaign - No Edit! [/b]
This Campaign was around 12 / 14 hours for me, which I did in three sessions. 
The Story is a basic and mediocre experience played in single player with a main character that is somewhat interesting. Most plot points are predictable to many players so the story doesn't surprise the player very much at all.The game has a few nice looking cutscenes and makes for a cinematic story teller but much is very simplistic at best.The main character can be relatable at times as a comic book / MCU fan, This is a plus for someone like me.
Some mission objectives are the most simple you'll get in a game (Hold the point / defend three objectives / destroy three targets) and leave much to ask for.Overall this campaign is not the best out there on the market, but if you like comic books, and you're okay with a basic story in the Marvel Avengers Universe, you might enjoy this.I enjoyed this campaign despite it being very simplistic, predictable, and at times a little dry, don't expect the best of the best with this one.

[b] The Multiplayer - Edited [/b]
After now playing the game for over 300hours, I can say that this multiplayer as it stand on PC right now is surprisingly fun! However the matchmaking and basics of this system is very much broken for the majority of players, We're currently awaiting a fix again for this, which means that we'll be editing this again soon. The multiplayer 'grind' system is a problem but i'll leave this part for that section below. 

[b] Performance - Edited [/b]
Performance on PC is much better post the 1.3.0 patch. The devs are doing a really good job at making very good changes to the game, removing bugs, working on fixing certain areas of the game based on community feedback. Some performance issues and crashes still persist and the devs are aware and actively working on it. I'll update this section again soon also!

[b] Looting/Gear Experience - Slight Edit [/b]
Okay so lets talk about gear. As stated above in the Multiplayer section, gear has a Power Level (Gear Score) for each item the player can loot / buy along with their own stats so that the player can build the perfect Avenger for their tastes and playstyle. The Power levelling system requires the player to grind missions to earn new gear to increase their gear score. Gear can be found in missions from chests / optional side quests / mission rewards and vendors.

Levelling the gear to the highest score per each character you play will take time, alot of time.

The gear given to the character can be useful almost 80% of the time while levelling until you reach the games soft cap on gear at 130. Once you have reached this, gear will start to drop at 130 and you'll need to boost gear higher if you like the gear pieces Stats and Perks. Each piece you collect at this stage can be boosted 10 levels to 140. This will increase the gears base stats, and Power level but will not change the perks on the gear.

Gear seems to drop with randomised stats and perks, so you'll want to hunt down the best roll for your character and the build you want, this will take a bunch of your playtime in this game. I have now managed to get to 165 hours played and have levelled Black Widow to the max level and power level, and have now gotten a nice build set up for her. I can say that in my own experience I at satisfied with watching my stats go up and tweaking my build to get the most out of my character for the way I want to play. 


[b]Edit- Loot drop rates, mission rewards, statistics and perk chances (RnG) needd to be improved, the devs are aware of this, and I believe they are looking to make major changes with loot, we're awaiting information on this, but for a short time the current system is workable, it will be much better given time from the community feedback given and the devs working on this area actively, granted slowly. But none the less.[/b]

[b] Combat - Not Edited [/b]
Combat in this game is great in my own opinion. This might vary for other players. 

Combat is done in Melee / Ranged and Ability play. Combat has dodge, parry and counters that the player can use to do good damage, to avoid enemies and incoming damage. Some abilities for each character rely on you being able to time your dodges and parry's so you have to somewhat pay attention to what's happening around you. 

Combat has light, heavy, and strong attacks that you will want to cycle through as you beat robots around the playspace. Along with these you can use status effects and stuns granted by gear perks, skills, and stats.

I would not say that this game is a 'button masher' as some have stated, but do think that the combat can be improved upon in it's current state. [b]This is the main strength of this game![/b]

[b] Enemy Variety - Slight Edit[/b]
Right now most of the enemies you'll come across are very similar to the last. 

Yes we have big guys, small guys, range guys and melee guys, some have shields, some don't. But since most of the enemies are exo robots, you'll get a little tired of these enemies after a while. This game will get content drops as it goes along with potential new enemies as we move away from AIM (launch game enemy faction)

[b]Edit : Ranged enemies are now tuned properly and no longer nuke the character.[/b]

To be honest, the combination of this section and the combat section of this review, does make for an almost mindless basher brawler looter.

It is still buggy as could be with occasional crashes but mostly just not registering hits, not allowing ranged weapon draws, dodges not registering, and basically anything you would imagine out of an early access indie game. The controls are a floaty mess, and your companions will regularly knock things away from your planned ranged attacks and super moves just as you finish a harrowing battle with the resistant camera to aim your damn lasers and rocks where you want them.

The campaign is so-so but the grinding mess you play afterward is just awful. Enemies will come in overpowered swarms that spam attacks from all directions to a point they cannot be avoided even when you are ONLY spamming dodges to try and go revive your awful AI teammates if you dare play solo. And don't worry, random robots can definitely one-shot the hulk if he dares wander into a +5 difficulty mission which you need to get gear to grind to the next tier to...repeat the exact same mission that is now +5 difficulty harder?

25,75584121,english,"Too many crashes and bugs (visual, clipping out of map, disappearing mission objective enemies). My theory is it all stems from netcode issues and multiple memory leaks. Playing multiplayer seems to increase the number of crashes. 

TLDR: I want to like this game, but there are so many issues that just saps the enjoyment of combat which is the main reason I play this game. All 6 heroes are amazing and each play style is unique with different things to master. However, because of the issues I cannot recommend this game, unless you have $60 dollars burning a hole in your pocket and have nothing better to do with your time. 

There are 3 distinct gameplay experiences as far as I can tell right now. 
Single Player 
Multiplayer (pre 150)
Multiplayer (post 150)

Single player is gonna be your campaign and focus on building up other heroes to do higher power level stuff. The campaign was good. Kamala is a delight! Had one crash during the final boss battle before the final quick time event. You can do all the multiplayer content solo as well.

Multiplayer pre 150 is more about equipping the highest power gear and manipulating drops to get to 150. 

Multiplayer post 150 - So power level 130 is the soft cap. You have to boost your gear to 140 and use a major artifact to get to 150. The loot grind treadmill is stupid and boring. The RNG of drops pretty much prevents any sort of min maxing. And if you don't have gear that is maxed just stay at power level 133 - 135 to farm gear. This is the biggest problem: *HIGHER POWER LEVEL MISSIONS DO NOT RESULT IN BETTER LOOT*. So if you are at 143 and running missions on Challenge 4 the loot is not much different than Challenge 1 at 133 - 135. Furthermore the loot RNG makes it so upgrades are near impossible to find. 

THERE IS NO ENDGAME CONTENT. Yes you can the do the Mega Hive released with 1.3. However, I have experienced many crashes on mission complete when running any hives (elite, normal, heroic). Which pretty much makes it unreasonable to spend 40+ mins of time playing to have the game ""crash"" and not even get the reward from the hive. The crash is just a black screen after the Mission Complete shows up after the characters are locked from moving. I've sat at this screen for 5+ mins at least twice and nothing happened. Additionally I've seen this crash on Villain Sectors too. Most the crashes like this were multiplayer but I've had it happen single player as well. (Mega Hive I'm looking at you - the 8 step mission chain, I crashed on completion of step 3 and my progress was reset. I was done after that.) Because of these crashes I refuse to commit time to completing these hives. Which is supposed to be the main endgame content right now.

Getting to 150 is also ridiculous when you consider the bottle neck of polychron. The bottle neck is further restricted because dailies for villain sectors and assignments are not working. I've been lucky enough to have my assignments work but I haven't had villain sectors for the past week. Thor was my first 150 today. 

Farming Loot:
There was at launch missions that guaranteed a legendary piece of specific brand. Which made sense with the amount of RNG, but they patched it out with 1.3. So without a place to farm loot in a looter shooter what do you do? Combine that with no actual endgame content and broken multiplayer, this game has a lot of work to do. 

There is no build depth due to the RNG of stats on gear and the RNG of perks. I wanna give this game a thumbs up but we cannot let AAA titles publish buggy unoptimized games on release. There is a lot of QoL improvements that need to be made. Loot needs to fixed. There are plenty of examples of good looter shooter loot. For example allowing re-rolling/storing of perks like The Division 2. And the lack of endgame content combined with patch 1.3 making loot farming worse isn't a good sign. However their recent Sept. 24th, v1.3.1 patch was a step in the right direction. They awarded 22 challenge points to each hero, gave out 100+ polychoron along with some uru. Lets hope they get loot, multiplayer/matchmaking working, along with some actual endgame multiplayer content.

Pros:
-Fun characters to play, each with a slightly different play style
-Players playing on easy can button mash for the most part, but at higher difficulties you need to be more thoughtful, so there's something for everyone
-A massive roster of potential heroes to be added to the game
-It looks pretty, even on lowest settings
-Devs seem to be pretty engaged at quickly fixing bugs and glitches, and they are implementing stuff based on player feedback

Cons:
-Missions are very repetitive
-AI are terrible at doing anything other than fighting.  They don't participate in objectives which gets frustrating
-Matchmaking rarely results in getting a match, so most of the time you play by yourself
-No rewards for playing on harder difficulties
-Characters that can fly can travel so much faster than non-flying characters

47,76802114,english,"This game is buggy. It crashes frequently. It can be frustrating when your button mashing is not as responsive as you would like. Still, I'm recommending it because I think a lot of these bugs will be fixed in the near future, and in my opinion this game has been worth the headache. 

The story is fun, and the banter during many story missions helped me feel like I was there as the character I was playing. I think that's the goal for an PRG like this and I think they hit this mark well. 

Each hero is a unique balance of playstyle. 

Ms. Marvel is the core of the story, and allows us to see becoming an Avenger through new and hopeful point of view. She has a great support ability which can heal other members of the team, as well as some strong attacks with knockback. The knockback can be frustrating in open areas as enemies can wind up flying across the map, you just have to be a little careful where you aim or time these attacks. 

Hulk is a tank who can dish out and take large amounts of damage, standing right in the thick of things, picking up henchmen and beating other enemies with their own friends. His takedowns are brutal and fun to watch. 

Iron Man is a bit of a glass canon, can dish large amounts of damage but can't take it. He has the ability to use boosters to fly around the map quickly and do flybys or carpet bombings of the field. Shout out to Nolan North, voice Actor for Tony Stark. He had big shoes to fill, and could have tried to do an RDJ clone. Instead he made Stark his own, a subtle shift from RDJ's charismatic playboy and much more of an Elon Musk who alienates people by being the smartest, most arrogant guy in the room. 

Black Widow uses her zip line to cross large open spaces very quickly, and can grab enemies with it and zip to them as well. She is a fast and agile takedown specialist who does more damage the longer she goes without getting hit. She also has 3 types of guns she can switch between, an accurate but low damage pistol, a less accurate but faster auto pistol, and a high damage slow reload high caliber pistol. She is easily the best ranged attacker in the game and can take down pesky flying enemies quick. 

Thor flies, but not nearly as well as Iron Man, wields Mjolnir, and can do electricity damage with his attacks. The most fun is a special ability in which he thows Mjolnir and pins enemies to the ground or walls. They lie there helpless, unable to move the hammer while you can beat down their friends elsewhere. When you are ready (or immediately if you desire) you can call Mjolnir back to you hand and then whale on the enemy before he has a chance to get up. 

Cap is a dodge and block specialist. I don't know if his defensive timing is slightly better than the other heroes, but when I play Cap I can stand toe to toe with some of the toughest bosses, bobbing and weaving in and out of the boss's grasp, chipping away at his health with swift bodyblows. 

Each character has skillsets which slightly overlap with other characters, but each whole skillset is unique so every character has a totally different feel when playing them. Each character is fun in their own way. I recommend giving each a try, perhaps starting with the HARM room (a virtual training suite where you can practice against waves of enemies). There were a couple of characters I thought I did not enjoy until I gave them another shot and learned how to use them. The unique feel of each character is one of the best design choices in the game. 

On the whole, a fun game that I think will only get better in the future.",1601455553,1601455553,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197992707057,159,5,4879,3076,4252,1601973176

Campaign was fun but extremely short and multiplayer is just plain repetitive with an unrewarding (and poorly designed) loot system. 

My main complaint is the stability of the game and bugs in general. Game is too buggy and despite having the recommended specs, the game crashes constantly. Even with the recent update I still get crashes mid mission, and guess what? I have to start all over again.

I'm actually thinking of uninstalling until a more stable version arrives. The verdict: wait until it's more stable and goes on sale.",1599814210,1601455371,False,2,0,0.503937005996704102,0,True,False,False,76561198066203482,23,1,2371,282,1951,1601107787

Very difficult to avoid off-screen damage.

Loot is just whatever holding LT equips until the endgame, then you can choose to customize a bit.

The campaign is great, cut scenes top-notch, Kamala is an excellent protag, voice acting is good I think, it's a bit cheese-ball, but in the campy marvel way.

I've been luck with occasional crashes only, frames are good on my rtx1080.

Combat when it works can be very exhilarating once you get parrying and follow-up down, you can pull off very long combos, juggling a very tough baddie to death, when you do it is a ""YES!!"" moment.

Sadly, these become fewer as you level up and all enemies are shielded and plasma etc so it can be a chore to do longer missions, much like Anthem or other games, enemies get stacked shields at the end, so it's a slog.

UI and match making are bare bones and don't work well enough right now. This should be highest priority.

I'd give it a 6/10, or maybe 7 for now. Buy if you really like Marvel and are very patient gamer with tech issues and frustrating design decisions marring the fun.I started out hating this game but refused to give up (on my $80!) so I kept at it until it suddenly clicked now i love the combat.

A lot of reviews mention crashes of which ive only had one, maybe ive been more fortunate than most.
However with the game i have mixed feelings. The characters are well created with good dialogue and graphics and storyline.
At first its fun to play but soon becomes repetitive, the campaign missions are good and see you progress through the storyline but the other missions available and replayable are always exactly the same, they dont seem to even move anything around, same objectives and for me nothing worth striving for, equipment system for heroes is one of the worst ive ever seen.
It very much seems like your fighting the same enemies over and over and i was looking for more variety in a big budget game that i paid £50, in this regard it feels almost like playing a chapter of marvel ultimate alliance and where it should move on it just feels more of the same.
It was a hard decision whether to tick recommend or not but storyline for me and characterisation swung it.

As a game it has a non-existent post campaign. 
Combat is repetitive and gets stale after a while even though each hero feels slightly different.

More content will be added through season passes but customers are expected to pay more money for a finished game. Terrible development process.

Overall the only regret I have is I paid the full, new game price for it. I wish I had waited for a sale.

The gameplay is fun. The characters are well done and the abilities really match up with what one would expect. 
The story is well done and teaches you everything you need to know. Currently there is no ng+ or way to replay the story without starting all over again so enjoy it. 

I'm not big on multiplayer so everything I've done has been solo. The companion AI does it's job and smacks things around and chases you down if you need to be revived. 

The ""end-game"" gameplay still needs a bit of work. It's lots of somewhat boring grinding. Long missions for lackluster rewards.
The only real gripe I have about the game in it's current state is the gear. It's like they set the rng slider all the way down.

Genshin has been in development for 3 years, Avengers was in the oven for 5? Seriously? It's clear the Avenger's team have no idea how to fix their own game. Save yourself the money and read all the reviews for this game before you buy.

(Sept 19th 2020) Post 1.3.0 update. While this update wasn't bad, it wasn't too good either. People are still crashing to desktop (Device Hung and Memleaks as usual). The uncommon power 1 gear people were getting as a reward for the Heroic Hives is now a legendary power 1 item... New single player content in an online multiplayer environment; I'll let you figure out what's wrong with that sentence. Overall, patch didn't address any of the major gripes people have with this game, while introducing content no one really asked for. It's week 3 and still not recommended... sigh.

(Sept 11th 2020) Final Update until/if this game ever gets to a playable state: DO NOT BUY. NOT EVEN IF YOU'RE AN AVENGERS FAN. THIS *WILL* SOUR THE EXPERIENCE. 

Edit/Update Sept 6th 2020: Crashing way more than usual... Still getting the graphic card memory leakage crash, but now there's a different crash that just closes the game without any error, and less than 20 minutes of restarting due to a prior crash (so that rules out mem leak crash).

Review is a bit biased because I'm frustrated right now.

Just had 2 crashes, both were during missions near the end. First crash was the classic memory leak. Second crash, literally messed up my whole computer so bad that I had to restart. I could alt-tab between programs but the whole screen was black. The fact that both occurred at the end of missions was... annoying, to say the least. I spend at least 30 mins in a mission (yes, I like to loot EVERYTHING; I am THAT person :P), so an hour or more of my evening was wasted.

You need to let us reconnect to missions in progress. Or at the very least, in an event of an unexpected disconnection, continue where our progress left off (loot or no).

Sigh... other than what happened tonight, I'm enjoying the game so far. Fights could use less staggering attacks (basic attacks SHOULDN'T STAGGER yet they do here...). The loot is very simple, which I appreciate (hold Q for best in slot, lol). I haven't reached endgame yet so not comments to make regarding that. I did finish the campaign though. The story was short but sweet, and it almost felt like I was in an Avengers movie, which was pretty coo.

TL;DR Good-OK game, but not a big fan of fights or the crashing/memory leakage.

Any time I start having fun with combat I then have to do 'chores' of its tacked on defense mechanics. LOTS of animation bugs. 

Mission maps are very generic, same maps get reused quite frequently. Even the high end ""HIVES"" and such are just several other mission types stitched together in a row.

I'm curious why they just didn't make this game entirely online instead of using draconian and bug riddled DRM. The campaign is MAYBE 15 hours and the companion AI is very poor. Its not even half a game without an online component.

The story aspect is pretentious and predictable. Takes lots of tropes and queues that originated in the MCU and weren't in the comics pre-MCU despite being 'separate.' 

Its mediocre IF they can fix the pile of bugs its currently suffocating under.

Update: High end makes combat even more 1-dimensional as fairly obvious and straightforward meta builds make it quite boring:
Black Widow - Basically invisible 99% of the time spamming takedowns or staff ultimates

Hulk - Heavy combos that have high range PBAOE, just wipe the field out, maybe even from behind a wall

Iron Man - Rocket and/or laser spam. I prefer rockets with splash damage. Pick a perch and go to town

100+ hrs after original review...

I still recommend this game and I'll explain later, but there are still residual bugs (short list below*) that have yet to be fixed. At the moment the game has nothing that will give it longevity, and it's partly due to the lack of content, but the lack of communication to the community on what's being worked on takes the cake. Not everyone should have to look to reddit for upcoming patch announcement info when Discord exists, e.g. I'm in the Discord and the ""patch notes channel"" get's updated the day after the update comes out. New content will create a small buzz, but it will not drive players to buy the game at full price (59.99+). Wait until the new content is released, then wait another week, then check to see if it's on sale, if it is, buy it, and if not just wait until it is.

My bugs/issues ""short list""

-bugged out notifications (!) e.g. I've worn a cosmetic, but still says it's new(!)
-fall/jump-vaulting an occupied ledge will get you stuck, e.g. was falling short of a ledge with resources, but caught it instead and was stuck until I took damage (5 minutes later).
-enemies are still being pushed and fall through the map and environment; still blocks progress (players as well)
-not sure how, but went partly black screen (HUD was still there) with a high pitched sound murdering my ears. Tried many methods, but only restarting the game via task manager fixed it.
-challenge 3+ needs a lot better loot tables, e.g. still get overwhelming number of blue items (would rather have upgrade modules instead of the gear-recycle mats).
-certain missions still (2 patches now) aren't advancing after completion.
-enemies can be triggered (and attack with certain attacks) through doors of areas further along facility, e.g. fighting a room, got backed up to the next door, heavy attacks triggered the next room, and was clumped at the door (I could see them with tac-awareness).

22,75723665,english,"So, they really did a disservice to this game with its beta -- the single player story campaign is surprisingly fun.  While it's not really as deep as I would prefer and a lot of it really boils down to the same 3-4 things over and over again, the writing stands out as being much better than it looked like it was going to be, even with ""discount MCU"" heroes.  Way better than I would have expected, definitely a fun ride.  Not exceptionally well written or anything, but definitely enjoyable to play through.

With that said, come back when it's actually stable and you don't have to jump through 30 hoops to try not to lose 45-60 minutes of progress when it randomly crashes for no good reason.  The game isn't very stable at all and it's very unpolished with a lot of really silly and chunky bugs that mess things up -- in the ~20-25 hours I've been playing, I've lost about 5-6 hours of play-time due to the game crashing 70-80% through a long mission, forcing me to replay it entirely.  Twice during the campaign, I had key mission dialog fail to play, leaving me clueless as to what the actual story was.  Other aspects of it just reek of a rushed launch -- for example, if you have HDR (and want to experience one of the absolute most _abysmal_ HDR implementations in recent history), I hope you enjoy setting your paper-white and luminance settings very single time you boot the game, because it sure doesn't save those values for you.  Throw in some graphical glitches like faces failing to draw sometimes, textures becoming garbled and shadows only applying over half of the screen and you've got too many things that should have been sorted before this game launched.

Multiplayer is day one destiny 1 -- aka, a terribly repetitive grind-heavy repetitive and boy did I say repetitive set of the same tasks in the same places with glacially slow progression.  It would be fine if there was more variety than the effectively 3 mission types they have to complete.  It's even more irritating when the game crashes in multiplayer, because you can't re-join the mission and there don't seem to be any checkpoints -- you just have to do it all over again.

At its core the concept is sound, the gameplay is quite fun, the single player is good, the multiplayer has potential.  Just ... wait until the first like 30 or 40 patches are released before jumping in, because it's a hot mess right now and it really, really detracts from the overall experience.

UPDATE:  We're 2-3 patches in and it still hard locks to a black screen at the end of missions, denying you rewards, the HDR settings still don't save between launch (to the contrary, now they reset any time you change _any_ video setting in the game, so it's gotten worse), using specials will still send you out of bounds and force you to restart to the last checkpoint, it still has many jarring graphical glitches with character rendering and shadow rendering -- the list goes on.  I _REALLY_ want to like this game, but every time I boot it I feel like it kicks me square in the junk for trying to play it.  I'm gonna come back in another month and see if it's at least borderline playable then, because as it stands now it's just stupid.",1599697425,1601320657,False,3,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,False,76561197993264938,818,36,2699,99,980,1601320470

Marvel's Avengers really good co-op looter paired with a solid single-player story. If you like Marvel heroes or Superheroes in general this game is definitely for you, filled with tons of Easter eggs and fan service it's a comic book fans dream. Then the bugs and crashes happen, it's really enjoyable but it's hard to enjoy when the game will crash at the end of an online mission which you then can't join back too or just freeze to a complete stop or just not load the mission at all.

24,76722865,english,"I want to thumbs up this game so much because Avengers has the potential to be great, but I just cant because it is plagued by bugs and bad design. TLDR: Wait 6-12 months and see what state the game is in by that time.

Pros
- decent combat, each hero (so far) feels pretty unique in how they are played and what their abilities do, and each hero is viable for all content with a well thought out build.
- Story is good, not great, but passable.
- Future content will be added for free, including heroes and story.

Cons
- PC community is pretty much dead from the terrible launch, it will need either a big revive with some good new content, or cross-play.
- LOTS of bugs, some are just annoying, some are HUGE and cause you to lose ALL progress, some have stopped people from progressing in the campaign since day 1.
- Enemy diversity is hugely lacking right now, including bosses, hopefully more enemies will be added in the next few months when the 2 new heroes come out, only time will tell.
- Game design is questionable right now, legendary and epic tier gear and interchangeable (they both have the same stats and perks etc) and exotics don't feel particularly exotic, they have the same perks as legendary and epic, but have slightly better stats and less RNG. Also you can only get exotic gear from difficult (and long!) single player content, in a multiplayer game... This will change soon with the raid like content, but still not great.
- Loot is very RNG based (of course, its a looter game), but its the bad kind with like 6 or so levels of RNG, so you'll basically never get that ""perfect"" piece of loot.
- PC performance is horrible. I get an average of 70 fps on LOW settings with a 2070/8600k/16gb/1440p with frequent dips to 40 fps.
- Spiderman is locked to PS4 when he releases because fuck Sony.
- Expensive microtransactions, but this might not be too bad considering the future content will appparently be free, suppose they need to make money somehow. Cosmetics can be earned in game though.

So, after putting about 15 more hours into the game, I'm sadly having to change my recommendation. There are just too many bugs for it to be enjoyable at this point, audio will very frequently, almost every mission, cut out in bizarre ways, footsteps will sporadically occur and then not for several steps, but the real problem is that the narrative of the game largely exists in commentary over the mission. Without it, the game feels much, much more repetitive, there are really only about 3 different maps to play, and then only about 5 or 6 missions with the only difference between them being the last 5-10 minutes.

I really want to give this game a positive review, but the audio bugs are really killing the experience for me. Fortunately I'm not crashing anymore... But this is almost worse than crashing.

1) The performance, even on high-end hardware, is EXTREMELY sub-par. FPS is all over the place regardless of in-game settings. The game can't even maintain 60FPS stable in the most basic environments/situations and I'm far exceeding the recommended specs.

2) Constant crashes. No rhyme or reason. Suffering through the ""campaign"" portion of the game which took roughly 10HRS was painful. The multiplayer portion seems even more poorly optimized and unstable.

49,76688961,english,"kind of mediocre beat them up game that gets boring pretty quickly. The single player story was quite fine and interesting, but already there in the second half it started to be more of a boring grind than a fun game. You already have the interesting skills and all thats left are mostly some passive bonuses, so there is nothing to look forward to in the terms of characters progression ... when I started it looked like at lvl 15 the interesting stuff will unlock ... sadly the opposite is truth, at lvl 15 you have most of the interesting stuff but there are still locked skill worth of maybe 20 more levels (multiply that by number of characters and you get a tremendous amount of time doing the same stuff and using the same skills over and over:-)).

Only a few story levels are good (corridor that looks meaningful), otherwise it feels like about 4 templates of environment to randomly generate some more open levels .... so it feels like you are visiting the same few places over and over again. And enemies dont improve the feeling. Get to a point, one or more waves of enemies will teleport there (there is only very few types of enemies), after you defeat them go to another point on the map and repeat. Sometimes while fighting, the game annoys you with the necessity to control 1-3 points or guard a group of people for a certain time period, or to destroy about 3-5 things (all of those with unlimited enemy waves until you reach the goal).

The fighting mechanics also feel somewhat random ... strange one-hit knock outs, ground attacks hitting you in the air, projectiles coming from everywhere, shielded enemies (meaning simply double health but without possibility to stagger/grab/knock them over until you deplete the shield), often you get hit by something you visually evaded but the game says you were hit.

But regarding marvel itself? It was fine, a lot of times there was a smile on my face and I enjoyed the story.

58,76684982,english,"Marvel's Avengers is a game with some issues, let's get that out of the way up front. When you're not encountering bugs or crashes, you'll be lamenting the repetitive post-game structure that doesn't have quite enough content variety to support the grind it asks of you. 

The thing is, beneath the problems is a darn fine action game, and one of a scale that Marvel fans have been wanting for ages. The single player campaign, which has largely been ignored in the marketing and in the run up to release, is fantastic. Plenty of cool setpiece moments are supported by great dialog between the cast. It's a somewhat predictable superhero tale, but a fun one, and one held together in large part by the lovable Kamala, who is the fantastic and personable center of a story that's as much her coming of age tale as it is an Avengers story, which is frankly why it works. 

As for the post-game, it is undeniably in need of some fleshing out, but it is a solid foundation to be built upon. All the building blocks are there for greatness to come, and the developers are already moving in the right directions. What's there might be a bit slim, the mission variety lacking, and the loot a bit underwhelming, but I still find myself compelled to pick it up every day and go another round against Taskmaster looking for better loot. The mechanics are solid and the progression systems largely well designed. It just needs more meat on its bones, and that will hopefully come with time. In the meantime, there is still more than enough fun to be had playing each of the characters to the current cap, as every one of them is great fun to play and the current combination of skill tree elements and high end loot may be lacking the build diversity of something like a Diablo III, but there's still enough to chew on to keep it interesting. I may wish for more spectacular high end loot, but I'm also not truly disappointed with what's there now as a starting point. 

Avengers provides 15 to 20 hours of surprisingly great single player story if you're up for a good superhero tale and enough post-game fun to power many hours beyond that. You unfortunately have to go in expecting some bugs right now, though the developer has been commendably open with the community about such issues and quick so far to issue numerous meaningful patches. You also have to set your expectations that this is a live game at the very beginning of its life. I think the stage is set for greatness here if the game gets the support it should. I really do. But the future is always a question mark and the present state is a bit thin, so you'll have to decide for yourself whether that's enough for you. 

I for one have been having a blast and look forward to many more hours. This is the epic Avengers team up game I've always wanted and the spiritual successor to Marvel Heroes that I've been craving since that game bit the dust years ago.

64,75775285,english,"Update:

I've changed my review to recommended in light of the developer updates, specifically bug fixes, and overall enjoyable combat.  The combat is a flippin' blast and I've grown to really appreciate the uniqueness of each character's kit

My main complaints at this point is the lack of endgame variety.  The levels feel very ""samey"" and the lack of a diverse pool of villains still puzzles me.  This is the Marvel universe in which you have big-bads coming out of your anus.  My guess is they are holding these back to incorporate over time

I have 25 hours on both PS4, and PC.  I shouldn't like this game, but I do

I played PS4 first, and finished the story.  After playing PC, all I can say is the console version can go to hell (performance on standard PS4 is terrible)

Summary: 

Overall, I really wish they had leaned into a solid single player game.  The ""Games as a service"" element makes it feel under-cooked as a whole.  That being said, there are some good things happening in the midst of head-scratching design decisions.  Lastly, a common criticism going around is that the combat is button-mashy.  Over time, I've learned that does start like that, but does become a bit more nuanced as the trees unlock.  In the end, if you shut your brain off to the not-so-favorable mechanics (which you can do) - then you are more likely to have a good time.  If you're not impatient (unlike me); I would probably wait for a sale.  This is a solid $40 purchase

What I like: 

- The main campaign is fun.  Some good set pieces and character moments
- Each character does feel different in terms of play style and abilities.  Combat is kind of a mixed bag.  Some parts work well, but other parts are really frustrating (see my dislikes) 
- PC performance seems to be decent.   Some frame drops here and there, but overall I hover around 75 FPS in ""open"" areas
- Character models look great (particularly the suit designs).  The game initially got a lot of flack for characters looking like discount versions of their MCU counterparts.  It seems those have improved over time and didn't bother me

What I don't like:

- Combat is really good in some ways, and really bad in others.  Overall, I see what they are going for but there are two major problems:
1) There is WAY too much that interrupts, staggers, stuns, suppresses, and knocks you down.   There is so much chaos happening most of the time, and too few indicators to give you a fighting chance to dodge or avoid these attacks.  This brings the combat to an unnecessary halt a lot of the time (with QTE's at that)
2) Combat and movement is WAY to animation heavy.  There are some animations that simply take too long (like summoning the Hulkbuster).  They need to speed them up to make combat and movement more snappy
- Character movement and traversing the world are not as tight as they could be.  Sometimes I feel like I'm not really traversing the world, but more-so, my character is animating while the world moves beneath me (not sure if that makes sense).  For example, when Hulk, CA, or BW are jumping onto a ledge or swinging, sometimes the character models don't connect to the surface.  Or, characters kind of teleport to the intended destination while their movements happen
- Environments and enemy types are very ""samey"".  There are really 3 environment types.  Inside a building, a city, and a ""open"" rural area",1599790209,1601239815,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False,76561198049222264,104,10,14914,7037,10171,1602052312

73,76672086,english,"Despite all of the bugs, which the development team has apparently been working around the clock to fix since launch day, this game is by far the best Avengers game I've played.

The characters are spot on, there's plenty of fan service and the best part is that the main character is a fan as well. The voice acting is done by veteran voice actors including a couple who have played the characters for years in Marvel animated films. (Thor, Black Widow)

The combat is well-designed for each character whether you're tearing up the environment as Hulk, tripping enemies up with Cap's shield, or flying through the air firing repulsors as Iron Man. Mjolnir feels like a character as well since you can use it to pin enemies and then draw it back to hit another enemy from behind. Kamala has her super stretchy undisciplined fighting style. Black Widow is difficult at first but once you get the hang of her style, is ridiculously OP.

TL;DR:
Pros:
Combat for each character that feels exactly how you would expect
Customizable skills, gear stats and perks
Incredible graphics
Main storyline has a lot of depth for all the characters and is true to their comic versions

Cons:
Loads of bugs from launch
End game gets repetitive 

If your hangup is because they don't look like the MCU Avengers, remember that comics change artists all of the time, and the character's faces look different because of that. (Also how many times have we changed actors for Spider-Man in the last 20 years?) Plus if you had them actually look like the movie, then it would have to sound like them too, good luck getting RDJ in a sound booth making 'Oof', 'Ow', or grunt noises for hours.

I absolutely love Marvel Comics and I can't recommend this game. The campaign in great, but it's not worth the $60 I spent.

The story it self is quite good and has it's classic Marvel moments, gameplay when working is quite solid as well and every hero has a unique feel.

However the game is plagued with technical issues and while they are fixing them allot are still around.

I can barely play with my brother and it takes us at least 15 minutes to get into a mission and even then it's unsure if the game is stable enough to finish the mission itself without crashing.

This isn't just the multiplayer, it's the single player as well.

I had to do the final mission 8 times before it didn't crash or I came across a progress breaking bug.

Well, time for some sleep.

(Update) I've started running into CTD after 7 hours into the game. One of the worst CTD experienced to date is almost finishing a mission and CTD resulting in the entire mission progress being lost. The CTD happens randomly and occurs without any warning. If this continues, or isn't fixed soon, I may start to downgrade the review. 

Another bug has to do with the HDR calibration not being saved whenever I exit the game - I have to reset the HDR calibration every time I start the game.

(Update) It's too bad the review doesn't allow for anything other than a binary of ""Yes"" or ""No"". I did manage to complete the campaign, and I really liked the story. However, the bugs and crashes mar the game far too much for me to really recommend the game to people other than those who are fans of the Marvel universe.

I haven't touched the MP/Co-op portion of the game either.

This is literally Anthem replaced by Avengers.
The mechanics are pretty simple. 
The game is super pretty in some areas, then extremely low quality in others even on super high settings.

Some characters you feel like you're a hero. Using Hulk, picking a dude up and slamming him repeatedly into the ground is fucking satisfying. Then some characters feel less so, e,g Iron Man.

Voice acting is good. But honestly, Nolan North ruins Iron Man. Every time he speaks I just hear Nathan Drake from Uncharted and it throws me for a fucking loop.

Its the usual RPG Gear system. Find better gear and equip it.

For a developer to recommend something like that without confronting the bug head on, reveals the the developers dedication to the consumers. Its the typical ""restart it"". I won't be surprised if they add a script that moves saved games and restarts it for you after every crash, so they don't have to deal with us.

14,76630081,english,"Marvel avengers was a game I had high hopes for and I still do have high hopes. The game is a looter and it shamelessly copied those elements from other notable games like Destiny and Anthem, however they pulled the worst elements from them. I personally love looter games as I have thousands of hours in games like Warframe but this game didnt hit the same spot that Warframe or any game in the catagory did. This game taught me off the bat that loot is only a number and not what defines your look at all which is something that looter games depend on. It got to the point where I didnt care if i grabbed that hiidden box of loot because it didnt matter whatsoever. The only way to build a personal connection to your character was by leveling them up and unlocking new skills and combos but the cosmetics are locked behind a paywall so If you inteded to make your iron man look any different from the person next to you them be prepared to give up a hefy $15+ per skin which is insane considering that we already paid $60 for the game. Each vendor is a direct copy from the vendors in Destiny which may or may not be a plus in your book but I hoped that Square Enix and Crystal Dynamics would create a game with their own ideas and not just copy off another game for whatever reason. 

The gameplay is repetative with the same loop for every mission (aside from the story) however the combat is enjoyable and its fun unlocking that new combo and then using it to pummel countless enemies, but this is overshadowsed by the countless bugs, crashes, and lack of optimisation. I built a computer just to play the game at it full potential and I have to be on my toes scared if Im going to crash and have to start my mission all over again, one time I crashed 5 times trying to do the same hulk mission which is just nonsensical. Its irresponible for them to release a game in the state it is which the only silver lining being the campaign.

16,76629483,english,"This game is pretty solid. Has a bit of a learning curve though. You cannot approach this game like a mindless brawler, you really do need to pay attention to your gear stats as they make a huge difference in the combat. The game does a fantastic job of making each character feel unique. Iron Man for example plays nothing like Thor does despite both of them fliers. Captain America plays nothing like Black Widow despite both characters being focused on punching the crap out of people and using some ranged abilities.

The campaign is alright I guess. Didn't pay much attention to it honestly. Its about 10 hours depending on how much exploring you feel like doing. The main character of the story is tokenized Mr Fantastic AKA Ms Marvel. She didn't add anything to the story but didn't really hurt the story either despite her cringy Beiber-Fever attitude towards the actual heroes so I guess we'll let it slide. Some of the missions were pretty cool admittedly and the final fight was fun. But if you don't care to do the story, you can jump right into the multiplayer after getting yelled at by the game for skipping the campaign.

Multiplayer mode called Avengers Initiative is your standard Games as a Service model. Repeat recycled content ad infinitum to get better gear on your quest for the top tier stuff. In my opinion, this game nails the moment to moment gameplay like Destiny did so I have no problems rerunning content. The Devs have stated they will release a new hero once every month for free so more content is coming. You'll only have to pay 1000 credits (Premium currency) to unlock their hero card but you get 1300 credits back so its a net gain of 300. Otherwise, its your standard Games as a Service microtransactions. Most of its overpriced but its all cosmetic. Honestly I don't quite understand the outrage over it.

If single player is your only interest, I'd be comfortable recommending you wait for a sale. There's still bugs and issues to be had throughout the game, and paying $59.99 for what you're going to get right now is a bit ridiculous. I'd happily pay up to $40 for the single player experience alone.


ORIGINAL REVIEW

Just save your money and check back in a year.

It's painfully obvious that the game was released long before it was ready. The game is littered with bugs that make it unplayable about half the time (and that isn't an exaggeration), and on the off chance you get it to work, I hope you don't die to a really random mechanic that requires superhuman abilities to react to. 

Patch 1.3 promised a fix of a thousand bugs, and I personally can't see one. My game hasn't improved at all. Multiplayer (the only reason I got the game) is in shambles. I can't connect with my buddy at all. When we try, the lobby crashes, kicks us out into parties with strangers (despite having matchmaking off), and puts us in loading screens that can literally be upwards to five or ten minutes.

There's several screens where buttons don't work. For example, on the Strike Team menu, there's several empty party spots with ""+"" signs on them, and they're clickable to add people. They don't work. You need to go into your friend's list to add them. Also, make sure to ask your friend if they're online, because that friend's list screen doesn't accurately show if your friends are online or not.

I've failed several missions because of them bugging out on me. Kamala and Widow love ripping their wigs off and running around bald. My PC's fan, which hasn't made a noise since the day I built it, goes into turbo jet engine mode the second I open the game. I'm using an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 graphics card, so I shouldn't have any issues, as the recommended card is NVIDIA RTX 1060.

There's also a glaring design flaw with how the game is meant to be played. At times it feels like it wants to be a hack and slash Dynasty Warriors game, and at other times it feels like it wants you to be calculating i-frames like a master speed runner to properly dodge all incoming attacks. Despite the game being glorified for being friendly to both single player minded and multiplayer minded gamers alike, they've added content that forces you to play both if you want the good end game gear. Not to mention the complete lack of end game content. If you like playing the same four mission types across seven different maps on six different characters for hours and hours and hours, this might be your game. If you can manage to get it to work, that is.

Some more bugs I failed to mention but deserve to be noticed: daily/weekly missions not updating; save games being wiped; skins re-locking themselves despite spending real world money to buy them; enemies not spawning; enemies continuing to spawn despite the mission ending, locking you out of completing the mission. Maybe some of these were fixed in patch 1.3. All I can say is that I played for two hours after patch launch, and decided to uninstall it.

If you need any further information on the failure that is this game, the subreddit is rife with complaints and opinions. Most people think this game was released way too early, and their plan is to fix it over the coming year. Some people also thing that Crystal Dynamics forced this ""live service"" game model on the developers, which is why the game feels like such a train wreck of unfinished ideas.",1600635748,1601160894,False,3,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,76561198042706085,147,5,2114,104,2009,1601487828

33,76615847,english,"Despite all the negative reviews, or mixed reviews, this game has hope. And here's why:

- The devs, whilst also participating in COVID regulations, seemingly work hard to fix all the at-launch issues which made it felt like this was released to soon (and it was, to be honest).
- Fixes to common problems do not escape their eye; AS LONG AS SOLID FEEDBACK IS GIVEN.
- A boatload of fixes have already been implemented, including to performance. However, it isn't 100% stable just yet (on higher than ""high"" settings).
- They (more so Crystal Dynamics than Nixxes) communicate frequently. Still not at a desired level, but still valuable enough.
- Whilst Matchmaking isn't quote there yet, improvements have been seen.

The game IS fun. There's no denying that. However it isn't bug free. That doesn't make it any less playable (unless you're unfortunate to be stuck on an infinite loading screen or frequent crashes). Perhaps, play on lower settings, or place your game on a SSD.

I'm certain the game will be improved much more.

1 Permanent Downside: The console gets more stuff from exclusive costumes to Spider-Man, whom hopefully won't more powerful than the all-platform heroes (including in the future). The exclusivity really sucks. It's like Disney vs Sony all over again.

36,76613134,english,"Not there yet. There’s plenty to like and plenty to hate about our beloved Avengers but one thing is certain: This is the building block for a multi-year supported game that has potential to add new characters and villains in the same vein as Rainbow Six, Ghost Recon, and Division. 

Start with the like: The campaign; it’s well polished, feels like a AAA game, the introduction to each cheater at the beginning, as the main story takes ship is a wonderful intro. The main camping is far better than I think everyone expected to be. 

The characters are all well-polished. That includes the voice actors and some of the commentary they make as you’re playing with them. Good work nailing these characters. It’s nice to see quite a few nods to the MCU films as well. 

The bad; Avengers is one of those games where you need to play 2-3 hours solo before co-op opens up. And even when that first co-op mission becomes available, it’s short-lived. You need to make your way through the entire campaign before you can consistently play with friends. This is mainly to help with the story campaign, but it’s annoying when you have to kick your buddy out because the next mission is single player only. 

Jarvis is annoying. Why? Why does he need to explain every little thing, even though it’s the 37th time you’ve sought out a secret SHEILD vault, or taken out an AIM base? It would have been fine through the single player campaign, but he needs to shut up in the end game stuff. It becomes especially annoying when he continues to tell you to go to the objective he has sent you… even though you are off exploring a “?” in your HUD. Let me explore Jarvis! Also, the HUD STINKS. Terrible interface. Fix that Please. 

The really bad: In said solo missions, for whatever reason, the developers decided to give our character specific missions the DUMBEST objectives imaginable. Example: There’s a solo mission with Iron Man. You are playing as f@@Kin Iron Man remember, and your mission, is to stand within a confined area on the ground while waves are enemies are thrown at you until Jarvis is done hacking the door. Like really? I am a super hero who flies around in an armored suit and my mission is sit on the ground? Figure this out because these missions STINK. 

You can tell the developers wanted to make this game, with hand to hand combat like the Spider-man game and Arkham games, but they really missed the mark here. For example, when an enemy is throwing a punch at you, and you hit the enemy before they land the punch, the enemy should not be able to land said punch… unless of course it’s an unblockable attack. So TRY to forget everything you know about the Arkham games because this was a huge problem for me towards the start of the game. 

Is it fun? Playing co-op sure is. Solo it’s quite a repetitive farm fest. There needs to be more variety in the missions.

I bought this game the second it released after playing the beta and basically waiting for it since it was announced in 2019. I want to keep this review short and easy to read. 

The good:
-Decent campaign with an original story
- Campaign feels fresh from start to finish and offers decent of gameplay hours (between 10-15 hrs)
- This game gives a new feel to some of the avengers, also considering they didn't use the MCU actors.
- Voice acting is good. 
- Plenty of missions post campaign to keep you playing the game
- Periodically release of new heroes as free DLC's.

The bad:
- Big performance issues for medium PC's (keep in mind the game is not even a month old so this might change)
- Not an open world game in 2020, especially a marvel hero game is kind of dissapointing.
- And the biggest issue for me, after the campaign, the side missions feel really repetitive, using the same kind of level based missions. Basically: Walk around, kill robots and infiltrate the AIM base. I wish they would have done some different kind of scripted missions, some for character development, some for combat and so on.

In the end, this is a good super hero game, especially if you are a Marvel fan, this might be everything you want combat wise. The story is good and graphics are amazing if you own a good PC. The problem for me is the lack of variety in the missions, post campaign. Even though they have different plots depending on the hero you play with, they still feel the same. As I previously mentioned, the game hasn't even been out for a month and I already feel a little bored, doing the side missions.

There are some weird design choices, like the punching button is the same as the interact button, resulting in you flailing around when trying to open chests and such.
Some QoL improvements are needed. They really need to adjust the dodging mechanic, you get stun-locked really easy, even as the powerhouse Hulk.
Other than that, this game suffers from the usual loot-genre GaaS-issues like very dull repeating environments and few enemy types. But I kinda knew that getting into this, it doesn't bother me much. 
The devs seem to read and respond to a lot of feedback though, so things are improving.

Well, despite all the above I am having a BLAST. Im on the verge of getting old and I did not think I would like this so much as I do. When I saw the very first trailer to this game years ago it looked hilariously bad, but here I am, enjoying it a lot.
The combat is amazing (except the stun-locking). There are debris and robot parts flying everywhere and you feel like you're in a super hero fight.
All characters are fun to play and are diverse enough, even if you can spot some reused anmiations for a few moves.
The story campaign was unexpectedly great with an epic ending and setup for future content. I think the story feels so high quality thanks to great voice acting. Nolan North, Troy Baker and Laura Bailey among others.

I get that people dislike microtransactions.
I think they are okay if it's done the right way. This game is almost doing it right. They are totally optional and don't affect the gameplay at all. But the price is waaay too high. I'd say you get all the coolest outfits by playing the campaign and iconic missions anyway. The only thing I feel Im missing out on if I don't spend any money (or grind for 2 months) is takedowns.

I don't think this game will last me years, but I didn't expect it to when I bought it.

After that's gone, you realize there is nothing more to this game than a mindless, repetitive grind with idiotic layers of RNG which goes to show Crystal Dynamics does not know how to make a looter and they clearly tried to emulate Destiny's power level system which fails horribly.

The loot is power level gated. If you are power level 130-132, you get a lot of 130 legendary drops but if you equip those higher gear which pushes your power level past 132 you get mostly 129-130 epic gear. You can test this by equipping lower power gear and capping your power level to 132 and below and storing your higher gear in the helicarrier storage.

There are only two iconic Marvel villains to fight after the campaign... two, seriously?! All the assets and level/environment are highly reused and their only endgame is making you wade through extremely boring vaults, hives, elite hives, elite heroic hives and mega hives.

Apart from the countless bugs, the game's core Challenge card / Dailies system can be easily abused by using the offline/online and changing system time trick. Even with the latest update they didn't fully fix this glitch. You can still reset your Challenge daily and weekly by going offline and changing the date then going back online.

I play a lot of MMOs (which are never really ""finished"") and I do a lot of beta testing of them as well, so I'm used to playing games with bugs all over the place.  However, when I spend $60 on an AAA title, I expect it to work correctly right out of the box.  Marvel Avengers has frequent game crashes, freezes, stuttering cut scenes, powers that stop working during battles, problems with auto-saves, and a whole lot more.  Near the end of the campaign, I ran into the ""eternal loading screen"" bug that apparently happens to a lot of people.  You simply can no longer log into the campaign.  You have to log into the ""Avengers Initiative"" section of the game and then do some backdoor hocus-pocus to get back into the campaign from there.  It's described online.  This is completely unacceptable in an expensive game in 2020.

During my time in the game, I've completed the campaign and leveled all 6 characters up to levels 11-15.  The campaign has an excellent story.  The writing is crisp, the acting is first-rate, and I felt like I was watching a movie.  Terrific job by everyone involved!

The campaign would take a good player maybe 9-12 hours to finish (15-18 for me).  After that, though, you're stuck with a pure grind looter-shooter game, where the loot is a waste of time and the shooting gets boring quickly.  There are daily and weekly missions, there are faction missions to do for specialized gear, and there's the option of matchmaking so you can play with other players.  The problem is that it takes forever to level up in this game, the gear you get is totally generic and a waste of time, the missions are cut-and-paste and boring, and the ""puzzles"" in the missions are all the same.  There's no imagination in this portion of the game at all.  Max level seems to be 50.  I can't imagine actually leveling up 6 characters that high with the missions/content that's in the game at the present time.

TL;DR version:  The game is full of massive bugs (unacceptable for a $60 game); the game post-campaign are boring cookie-cutter loot-based missions where the loot is a waste of time; the campaign is excellent;Unfortunately, this isn't the Avengers game I was hoping for.",1600235049,1601087263,False,4,0,0.546963155269622803,0,True,False,False,76561198065376773,25,3,4777,1375,4177,1601779263

While I would like to say I appreciate the work the developers put into ""attempting"" to make this game I have to say I'd rather have Marvel Heroes back - I'm sure that game was scrapped so they could create this title. (Though honestly the )poor decision making of the leadership killed that game)

For a game that should have been an easy win for any development company with half a mind in the industry: It just feels like it fell to the lowest bidder with a mid-grade ""promise"" on top of ""cosmetics-will-sell-it"":
Miserality: (Miserable - Reality)
1. Release the game in a disastrous buggy mess of a state

2. Lackluster content / gameplay / map variety

3. Generate a matchmaking pool that only pits people of relatively close-ish levels together - + / - around 5 levels instead of basing the entirety of enemy difficulty on character power level and some sensible degree of ""cap areas xyz"" to higher level content
3a. Honestly the matchmaking would probably be better if the player population wasn't in such a poor state due to other issues

A game that should have clearly been pushed out another couple of weeks for release. It is apparent the developers or most likely publishing company was more interested in cashing in on the title than they were letting it stew a bit longer. 
There was a clear and obvious sign the game needed more time under development - I held out high hopes for it, but sad to say, it's just not moving in a very positive direction fast enough.

The game play is fun and the character design is decent - but the scope of the game and the matchmaking has killed it for me for the time being. Call me when you get some substance in there.


I've enjoyed the time spent so far, while stable and actually in full groups, the game can be rather enjoyable.

It'll be difficult to recover from this one - I'll check back again later but not holding out much hope at this point. Hopefully you can salvage this.

Edit: after some thinking over the subject i was able to devise a realistic review.

Marvels Avengers launch was a train wreck, but this will not over shadow the fact that this is an amazing game, with great gameplay, and more than decent feel to every character available. And now on patch v 1.3.1 I am happy to tell everyone that the game is finally stable and playable with very rare fps drops and bugs. I've made a video review of it and gave it an 8 for what it was trying to be, as I find it terrible to judge the game by its state that would be fixed in some weeks.

I am glad to say I will not go back on my review, and after this last patch i can only say good things about Marvel's Avengers, buy it and play it. It offers at least 80 hours of astonishing multiplayer action and it rarely fails to deliver fun and intense moments of combat.

Missions are asking me to complete Snowy Tundra Vault, but the mission isn't completed after doing so. Not sure if the mission can be completed multiple times since IT IS NOT CLEARLY EXPLAINED or if it's -another- bug.

After patch 1.3 I haven't had a single crash YET.

BUG: Reload Checkpoint will make your HUD disappear.
This happened to me after starting ""Enter Avengers"", defeating a Dreadbot located to the right of the starting point, before crossing the closed bridge and immediately restarting checkpoint.
Seems to happen if you reload checkpoint at any point in the open map.

BUG: Rescue ally doesn't count towards challenge.
If you rescue an ally from a containment unit and leave the area while it's being rescued, it won't count. Simply stand on top of the unit while it's being rescued and it will count.

BUG: Villain Sector not counting towards challenge.
I completed 3 types of Villain sectors. Villain Sector, Elite Villain Sector, and Villain Sector required for a faction quest. None worked.

BUG?: We cannot pick up last item before mission is complete.
Let us walk around when the mission is over. AT LEAST A FEW SECONDS. You can't pick up a last drop unless you are literally standing over, eg, Abomination's corpse.
If you are flying with Iron Man you can keep flying until you land.

BUG: Enemies behind doors
Still some enemies keep getting trapped behind closed doors.
Some attacks can still hit them. Iron Man's Laser, Captain's Brooklyn Brawler.

BUG?: Vault mission not counting towards challenge
Completed a vault at 80% and it did not count. Completed the same at 100% and it did count. Either a bug or THE MISSION SHOULD STATE ALL REQUIREMENTS.

Talk about buyer's remorse. Let me start by saying the story campaign is amazing. It is fun, engaging and has a good story. The game mechanics are well suited to it and it will give you a couple of days enjoyment, hands down.

Is that worth the price of admission? No.

The endgame, not a pun, here is what happens after The Avengers are assembled and you have to restart SHIELD and fight baddies and...

Well that's about it honestly. 

There is a grind that makes even the worst MMO look like fun. It is literally the same MOBS the same locations doing the SAME objectives again and again. At least other games change the damn mobs to give you the illusion you're doing something different, but not here. Nope. Robots. A lot of them. Flying robots, teleporting robots, ice robots and then the super mega do a lot of damage and take a ton of time to kill robots. All the robots all the time.

The difference in characters is minimal. You punch, You punch harder. You have a ranged attack that just sucks cause the aiming component is just trash and three different SUPER abilities that aren't so super. There is gear that doesn't change appearances, there is gear that is supposed to make you feel more powerful but because EVERYTHING in the world scales with you, it never feels like it. Every mission is the same thing with the same mobs at the same difficulty. 

You can do faction quests so you can raise your faction so you....can buy more gear, so you can do more faction missions so you can raise your faction so you...

You get it.

All of this would be...well horrible to be honest, but it is made unbearable with the metric ton of bugs this game had and still has. I can't recommend this game to anyone. If it was 35 bucks and only the story campaign, maybe, and that's a small maybe. But at this price with these problems with this little content...I am so sorry I ever bought it.

29,76514712,english,"Throughout playing the campaign, I was very much having a great time with this game. I found the story far better than i expected, the combat started simplistic but quickly develops into better systems, and the potential of this game as ""a service"" was exciting. During the first hour of the post game I was more than happy to grind and level up characters, complete daily challenges, and see how the game developed, but it was here that I ran into the first real hitch in my experience.

This game is not finished, it was rushed out to meet fiscal responsibilities and beat the heavy hitters of the holiday season. While during the campaign my PC (i9, RTX 2060, game installed on NVME SSD) crashed a few times, i thought it was just a byproduct of the game not actually ""Releasing yet"" (since the deluxe edition launched three days early). But as i went through the post game, i found my system crashing near constantly. 1080p was not sustainable at times, even without pushing other graphical settings. 60fps was a pipe dream with drops to single frames for no ""real"" reason. The CPU would exceed 100% due to a glitch, and even after the ""big fixes"" I found the game crashing every 15 minutes if I entered anything beyond the most simple combat missions.

I know it's not just my system, I've watched friends play the game on Xbox One X and similar issues occur, with his crashes occurring even more frequently than my own. 

I know ideally the devs would have delayed the game if they had the choice, but Square wasn't letting that happen, and it shows. In one year, the game will be in the bargain bin as most early adopters will see it as yet another ""game as a service"" that couldn't compete in the market.

Usually my biggest concern in a game like this is monetization, and on this front, the prices are so laughable I can't see anybody forking out the cash. 

If you are interested in this game for anything beyond the campaign, I can't recommend it. I'm sure you'll see every outlet claim this has ""huge potential?"", and sure, most AAA games do. But since release this game hasn't maintained relevance even without serious competition, so I can't imagine it's gonna fair better when the holiday season rolls around.

30,75650322,english,"Edited 09/24/2020:
Looks like they are updating regularly, fixing a lot of the problems I encountered earlier, but this game need more optimization. I have i9 10900k, 32gb of 3200 ram, and 2080 ti running at 1440p. I still only get max fps of about 70, but there are too many times it drops to the low 40s. This is during the campaign also where it is a controlled environment. There still isn't much variety though. I would probably wait till its on sale to buy. 

I don't even know where to start. When you think The Avengers you think excitement, power, gripping gameplay. What I found in this game was a bit lackluster. Now don't get me wrong, the single player campaign has its fun moments but overall, it just feels like something is missing. For instance, when you are playing the Hulk you should feel super powerful or something along that line, but I seem to die more as the Hulk than any other character. In truth, this game feels more of a button masher than anything else. You can see that they were aiming for an RPG element, but there is really no thrill behind that. I'll use Hulk as an example, you have four items to upgrade. But unlike a traditional RPGs where you are looking for better armor and parts, this seems to leave you a bit wanting. You technically get a new piece of armor that increases it by one point. You can use resources and other things that you find along the way to upgrade that piece of armor, but it just feels like something is missing. You don't see any type of cosmetic change, and you really don't feel much of a power change or armor change as well. You do get skills that you can unlock, but again most feel kind of lackluster. For Ms. Marvel , it's like you unlock a skill that now allows you to jump and kick in a combo , so instead of punching on the third button press it's more like you jump up and kick on the third button press. There are times where something will pop up on screen and tell you to press a couple buttons together and you will do a type of finisher move, but even then a really doesn't feel badass, and if I'm going in as the Hulk or any other Avenger I should have that sense of badass . 

The graphics of this game are very good, especially if you download the high resolution textures, but it's very linear. There are some parts in the game that allow you to explore, but again only what they want you to explore it's nothing like Skyrim or fallout where you can just decide that you want to move in One Direction and continuously travel there . The enemies are also repetitive. Same robot but different color or little bit bigger of a robot that has a different move but there is really no variety. I have put almost 8 hours into it and I am still just the Hulk or Ms. Marvel. Then you come to the marketplace. I really don't like games that add marketplaces when they charge you full price for a game. If the game was sold for 30 or 40 bucks, then I'm OK with the marketplace because I understand that the devs have to make their money somehow. This is a $60.00 game unless you buy the digital deluxe version, which I did, for $80 and then having a marketplace where some items actually costs $12.00 for say one costume. That is outrageous. Wait for a sale or see what they bring to it with future updates.

The game is not boring, but it feels like it's early access. It's almost like something is missing, and I'm not talking about Spiderman if you know what I mean. It is one of those games it doesn't call to me. It doesn't make me want to sit down and play, it feels more like a filler. Something that I would play in between other games I would rather play. If you played the beta, that's basically what this game is. I played the beta and thought OK, there is probably a lot more to do in the actual game, this is just a little taste. I was wrong. I enjoyed the beta, but I was nowhere near blown away by it. Beware of the steam refund as well because with the cut scenes in the beginning gameplay, it's about four hours before you really get into the meat of it. I kept pushing myself forward thinking OK maybe once I get to a certain part it's going to open up. Well I got to that part, but it still feels the same. I hate not recommending this game but in the state that it is right now I would suggest to either wait and see what kind of content they bring to it or wait for a sale. This looks and controls like a AAA game, but again it feels more like early access.",1599576642,1601001694,False,5,0,0.561752974987030029,0,True,False,False,76561197990793184,464,14,684,178,584,1601076357
31,76513017,english,"Despite a few hitches and what some would call a rocky launch, I can say that Marvel's Avengers is the multiplayer super hero game I didn't even know I would want. At first I really didn't think I'd enjoy it , but the Beta proved me wrong. It was severely limited compared to the entire release, but it still showed off what it needed to.

The game itself looks and plays wonderfully, and it has a good story as well.

Each hero feels different/unique and plays well with one another. I prefer Iron Man, and the game does an amazing job of making me feel like I am really playing as him. Currently there are 6 playable heroes, with more being added in the future. 

I won't go into specifics about bugs, but the game has had its fair share of them on launch. At the time of this review however, we're a few patches in and the game is playing much better and feeling more stable all around. 

The game itself runs great on my setup :

Intel Core I7-9700F
16GB Ram
Nvidia Gefore RTX 2060 

However, I don't have an amazing display and my FPS caps at 60 as a result, so I may be biased on what ""Runs Great"" would be to the average player. I rarely dip below 50 in intense situations (debris physics and lots of enemy ragdoll in light intensive areas, like the city map) 


tl;dr 

Good gameplay, amazing graphics, and great story. Amazing with friends

34,76511359,english,"This is what happens when games aren't delayed.
-The game isn't challenging. The only way to make it more challenging is to make the enemies deal more and take less damage. Unlike similar hack-n-slash games like PS4 Spiderman and Middle Earth, Marvel's Avengers has garbage AI. The AI doesn't seem to get smarter depending on your difficulty, either. As you progress the game, enemies don't get more difficult; the game just throws more ranged/aoe enemies at you to give you the illusion of challenge.
-The gear system is tacked on and so clearly rushed. That goes for all the other forms of ""progression"", like the skill tree, but I'll get into that below. This isn't any kind of RPG, they're just trying to give you the illusion of an RPG by using nothing but recycled systems from outdated games. This is 2020 ffs, come up with something new.
-The story is trash, filled with plot holes, horribly written and they try to hide it with great voice actors like Nolan North and Laura Bailey. And it's literally only 10 hours long if you don't struggle. I'm baffled that out of all the ""bad guy"" factions in the Marvel universe, they chose AIM... For a hack-n-slash... Not even considering the fact that other failed Avengers games in the past have also done AIM as the bad guy....
-The skill trees are bland, and basically the same for all 6 of the playable characters except for slight differences to try and keep you interested.
-Everyone else has said this, but I'll say it anyway. Bugs. This game is not optimized for PC. Constant crashes. Missions never ending because an enemy got stuck. Crashes because an enemy got stuck. Controls not working. Any possible technical issue you can think of, you can find in this game. Don't do what I did and think ""nah, my PC is super strong, it'll be fine"". It won't.
-Forces you to play specific characters. From start to finish of the campaign, you don't really have any time to become good with any one of the characters. Maybe you'll enjoy it if your favorite character is Kamala; they force you to play as the brat for half of the campaign. [spoiler]My personal favorite avenger is Cap, so I was extremely disappointed to only unlock him like 3 missions before the campaign was over. Was also disappointed with his gameplay the most out of all the playable characters[/spoiler]

Many studios in the past have tried but failed to create an avengers game. I'm so horribly disappointed. I remember back in like 2017 when this game wasn't even announced, it was just known as ""The Avengers Project"" and we only knew that Square was making an Avengers game. There was so much potential for the game. Marvel's Avengers (the IP, not the game) is a huuuuuge space to create a game out of, with so much potential. But Square gave us a horribly written, unoriginal, buggy 10 hour campaign; buggy playable characters with a bland, unoriginal progression system; and tacked-on after-campaign gameplay.
-They spend so much money on getting an all-star voice acting cast for this videogame, but they get some no-name to voice the main character? They force you to play as Kamala so much, you'd think they'd get a good voice actor like Laura Bailey for her. Oh wait.

I really hope that after this disgrace of a Marvel video game, publishers will begin to realize that the best way to make a Marvel game is the same way they make the movies.

So I initially reviewed this game with the mindset of ""Oh boy! New game! Good graphics! I had fun for a little while! 10/10 would recommend!"" However, after taking some time to actually think about it, the cons outweigh the pros by a long shot.

Lets start with gameplay. It needs work to say the least. When you first get the game, it is a brand new experience, everything is fresh and new. Every hero feels pretty different so there's at least a bit of variety there. When it comes to the missions... they are literally all the same. It's so repetitive. I tried so hard to carry on with the game after finishing the campaign but good lord I literally cannot bring myself to. Every mission looks the exact same, play the exact same and it gets boring super quickly. The campaign itself is pretty okay, I personally enjoyed it. The movement is very odd as well. I can count numerous times where I actually had to stop playing the game because I was getting motion sick. 

The graphics are pretty nice! I thought the game overall looked very good. One of my biggest complaints is the hair. The hair on Black Widow and Miss Marvel break all the time and end up clipping through their bodies and it looks really bad and unnatural. Which reminds me, this game is horribly optimized. It was even worse during the beta, so they did improve it some before the public release but it could still be much better. 

So in my honest opinion, this game should have waited a few months before releasing to the public. There are still so many bugs and optimization problems that should have been worked out before release. There's only about 10 hours of enjoyable content, all of it from the campaign which can be very repetitive at times.

Restarted game and Now i was in the matchmaking screen , the teammates sections were spinning like looking for members, they stopped, then a couple seconds later black screen and locked up.
Checked temps , noting close to overheating , and also no OC on my cpu or gpu. Nothing running in backround except for evga precision x1 and that i even have hw monitor off.

EDIT 9 18 2020  After todays patch .   and playing for about 45 minutes had a hard lock on game ( no crash ) .. Using Thor just hitting npcs.   Thanks Nixxes for the patch and the regression of quality..... for me today.

EDIT 9 17 2020 used DDU , installed Nvidia 456.38 driver used same settings and ran launcher ,  restored default settings and actually turned up some settings and now no more FPS drops , yet , the only thing i notice when hitting V key the audio lags / stutters a bit still at first when hitting the V key ( like before )

EDIT 9 10 2020 ... All NPCs and i died , i still could kill enemies and bash stuff, couldnt res npcs, tried to use elevator and nothing happened,  another BUG,  had to reload last checkpoint to fix it.

The problems plaguing us PC customers....   

The frame drops before the 1st pc patch weren't too bad but noticible every once and a while,  after the patch i got terrible ( drops to single digit fps ) stutter / low fps drops.  
The crashes to desktop before the patch was terrible, after the patch i didn't have any but i didn't play much after the patch because of the FPS drops still.
Not having a Nvidia game ready driver on release also shows the game was released sooner then it should have been. They probably were going to release later but didn't want to compete with the big titles coming in a month or two.

Online matchmaking is pretty bad and people usually get dropped from matches. I still enjoy the game but hopefully some updates fix these things.

81,76408763,english,"[h1]This game is just not fucking worth it.[/h1]

I am a huge marvel fan, and have been for over 20 years. I want to like this game, but it's trash and it doesn't improve upon anything that has come before. If it was still being sold here on Steam, I would strongly recommend  purchasing Marvel Ultimate Alliance over this, it is so much better than this shiny heap of shit.

The first half of the Campaign is... passable... for the second quarter of it anyway. The whole ""Avengers Day"" celebration in the first quarter, is something I found cringey even when hearing about it prior to the game's release. Like the Avengers would read thousands of ridiculous fan fiction submissions (or even have time to do so) and then have a day/expo celebrating themselves like something out of Adam West's Batman. But the story afterwards is basically a watered down fusion of Inhumanity and the aftermath of (the comics) Civil War. The Heroes are seen as pariahs, the bad guys take over the world, and normal people don't seem to have a problem with it. Inhumans are ersatz Mutants again ([spoiler]there's even a fucking [strike]Sentinel[/strike] ""Kree Sentry"" in the game[/spoiler]). Kamala's quest for truth/to reunite the Avengers is enjoyable to play, and is mostly cinematic, up until the War Table is introduced, and the MMO/ARPG mission style format takes over (also coincidentally, when the bugs/crashes started kicking in for me).

Afterward we are quickly reintroduced to each member of the Avengers that appeared in the prologue, and then abruptly brought to the endgame.

[h2]PROS[/h2]
[list]
[*][b][u]Beautiful Graphics[/u][/b]: If you can run it without it melting your hardware
[*][b][u]Voice Acting[/u][/b]: For the most part is solid. Kamala, Thor, Hulk, Black Widow, and Cap, all sound good. Tony is a little grating though (to me).
[*][b][u]The First Part of the Campaign[/u][/b]: As previously mentioned, plays smoothly and gets one acquainted with the controls.
[/list]

[h2]CONS[/h2]
[list]
[*][b][u]Combat[/u][/b]: Game seems to want to focus on 1v1 melee combat (for most characters), but you are constantly bombarded with attacks from OFF SCREEN. I know I know, all the supportors of this game are saying ""YoU DOn'T KNow HoW tO PlAY, jUSt pArRY AnD DOdge"", but half the time the indicators don't even show, and the other half of the time, you're being hit with so many lasers that IT DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU PARRY OR DODGE CORRECTLY, something is going to hit you and eat at least 2/3 of your [strike]health[/strike] ""willpower"". It gets even worse when you are up against multiple Adaptoids (elite super powered androids), when they all fire their death laser in unison at you and you last about all of 2 seconds. Only to get up, and be lasered again, and downed again in 2 seconds. THIS IS VERY COMMON IN LATE GAME/ELITE MISSIONS. The most common reasons I lose I find, is either, 1) being stun locked to death by multiple powerful enemies or 2) Being hit by barrage lasers from offscreen that don't stagger, don't show indicators, and eat away at your health, so that while you're focused on wailing on some poor AIM Scientist, you're secretly being blasted to smithereens. I understand if they want to make a game difficult, but it should be difficult BUT FAIR.
[*][b][u]Grind[/u][/b]: Unlike Ultimate Alliance, where all characters would (more or less) level up in unison, each character must be individually levelled up. And Levelling up doesn't even make your character stronger, it just gives access to another skill point to spend on the skill tree. You actually need gear for your hero get stronger which is yet another grind...
[*][b][u]Loot[/u][/b]: Feels forced, and thrown in there because ""everyone else is doing it"" they don't even give you cool side-effects like in Marvel Heroes.
[*][b][u]Key Bindings[/u][/b]: Why do we still force pressing multiple keys/mouse buttons for actions in 2020? You know how many times I'm sprinting, and I press the ""hero sense"" key to show the markers on the map and instead my artifact ability activates? ALL THE FUCKING TIME. I don't know why this is necessary? It's not like their are a dearth of keys to choose from the remaining keys. I use a 5 Button mouse, so I remapped Heavy attack and dodge to my Mouse 4 & 5 Buttons, so I have even more bindings to spare. 
[*][b][u]Rest of the Campaign[/u][/b]: Buggy, Choppy. Rushed. Garbage.
[*][b][u]Immersion[/u][/b]: Is it weird that the Avengers are fighting what are described in game as basically ""Scientists with guns,"" and they can take not one but multiple hits from the hulk, unshielded? They should at least fly a hundred yards after getting punched by the guy. Or as Iron Man, I have to use missiles to feel like I'm actually damaging anything? This game does not give you the power trip you are looking for, and for what reason? It's PVE, it's not like there should be a tremendous emphasis on ""balance,"" since your level of power doesn't detriment other peoples fun (if you play with friends, which I for the most part, do not).
[*][b][u]Bugs[/u][/b]: Still a lot even after ""The Big Patch"". Almost Every time my character climbs a ledge. They can't move, unless I jump. Sometimes my characters freeze in place, only opening and closing their mouth, as if they are a carp out of water, gasping for air. [strike]Battle Pass[/strike] Character Card, missions not registering properly. Black Widow likes the T-Pose on the Helicarrier bridge. I still get crashes. To sum up. This game is Early Access in disguise.
[/list]

[h2]Conclusion:[/h2]
I've raged so many times because the game killed me out of nowhere, and I have decided after powering through and getting Hulk to level 49 (out of 50), and almost getting the ""Big Green"" costume (classic Green & Purples) in his Battle Pass, that this game is not worth the frustration it causes.

For me it was a fun ride going through the campaigns, gearing and leveling all the heroes to 131+, but unfortunately there's absolutely NO ENDGAME (well 54 floors of Hive each week SOLO, but that's boring as f*ck).

Still coming back for all the post-launch heroes but to actually play this 24/7 and keep grinding @ endgame, it would need some serious reworks and changes.

What Avengers needs to work as a long-term ARPG/GaaS is essentially:

- Online Saves
- Post-level cap progression system (i.e. Paragon levels)
- Loot 2.0
- Endgame 2.0

What it currently has:

- Story (more on the way)
- Heroes (more on the way)
- Combat

It really saddens me the loot/endgame design was very weak and even incompetent at places.

It has been a week or more now and still no fix. I reached out to square enix chat support for them now to tell me it was an issue with the patch 1.3 and nvidia's driver update for the new video cards (again this is what chat told me) that they are working on a fix, again its been over a week, they told me to keep an eye on the news feed for updates on the official site.

1,75770085,english,"Honestly, I'd only recommend this game to fans of the franchise. The gameplay itself is very shallow and uninnovative, basically the same systems and mechanics that we've seen in dozen other titles (and the said titles implemented them in a better manner). Combat Designers just imitated mechanics and systems form other games, could have worked but everything feels clunky (the dodge system, among others), repetitive (perform action A or B, extremely binary decision making) and not properly playtested. The core gameplay loop is very similar to BioWare's 2019 Anthem. 

The narrative is fine, cutscenes are top notch but there are many better games out there. If you're expecting something groundbreaking, you'll be disappointed. Also, the classic findable collectibles that incentivize exploration (of quite repetitive level design) to artificially lengthen playtime are used as a narrative tool, I wouldn't really mind it but the things is, you can't even browse the collectibles, you just get pop up messages with a tooltip (unless I missed it which also is an issue in itself, edit: eventually I figured it out but the game does not tell you with which input to access the collectibles after encountering them for the first time). If such a system is introduced, I feel like the narrative designers should really write SOMETHING to go along with it. 

Also, the game has some UX related issues and clearly some cases were omitted. As an example, it can be a hassle to SWITCH A CHARACTER while in the central hub. edit: they actually added a UI button that allows you to switch characters,  no idea how this didn't get picked up on during playtesting. 

Again, if you're a big Marvel fan, you probably will enjoy this game (perhaps even immensely so). Otherwise, avoid it. The game is somewhat decent (a solid 5/10) but not really worth its current price tag.

Multiple crashes, piss poor performance at time (getting better with patches but still not what I would consider great), missions breaking, etc. It's very obvious that the game needed at least a few more months of development but was rushed out. Maybe a holiday release would have been better. 

That being said, the campaign story is really well done. I enjoyed it a lot. A really solid Avengers story focused on a character (Ms. Marvel) that doesn't get a lot of attention. There are a lot of really good moments in the story and a lot of fantastic set pieces. The last level of the campaign in particular stands out as a fantastic mission/fight. 

The characters are all (for the most part) unique and interesting to play. Iron Man, Black Widow, and Thor in particular stand out to me as a lot of fun. Personally I can't stand playing Hulk at all, but that will probably vary person to person. 

I can't speak at all to the endgame/""games as a service"" aspect of the game yet as I haven't touched that mode yet. 

I'm going to set this game as recommended, but I would suggest waiting a few more patches to see how performance gets ironed out and see how post launch support in terms of content releases/characters.

EDIT: So post launch has kind of been terrible. You can look at the subreddit for more details, but in general it seems that the developer is more focused on stealth nerfing drop rates of endgame gear and materials than fixing huge issues with the game and adding more content. It's hard to recommend this game at this point. It's probably best right now to wait and give it a year and see how it shakes out before buying it.

25,75820884,english,"My kids and I have been really having a great time with Marvel's Avengers so I though I would put a few thoughts down for those who may be on the fence.  I am intentionally avoiding any spoilers in this review.

Pros:
- Good story with excellent cut scenes/animations that really bring the marvel universe to life.  
- Combat is also well done with many impressive combo animations.  
- I play using a controller and find the controls to be intuitive, not too hard, and not too easy.
- The only micro-transactions I have seen thus far are for purely cosmetic items and do not affect game balance.
- Each character has it's own unique play style that matches the character's powers/theme while still not making you learn 5000 button combinations to master more that 2 characters.

Cons:
- Being a very new release this game suffers from the same issues many new games do,  glitches.  To date the most annoying glitch I have encountered is not being able to leave the cosmetic vendor menu without a ctrl-alt-delete.  (This no longer happens to me post patch 1.3)
- The 1.3 patch notes say they addressed a ton of issues.  I will say however that in playing the game since the patch many things have been fixed, but I still crash or hang at least 3-4 times a day if not more.
- Multiplayer is also difficult since my kids and I all have the random crashes and when you multiply those crashes by 2-4 it is then pretty predictable that someone in your party will crash in about every 2nd or 3rd mission forcing you to restart that mission when everyone is back together.

In summary the game is definitely not without problems and was probably released too early, but in my opinion it has a good base to build upon with updates that will follow.  I do recommend the game to any Marvel comic fan with some patience to deal with growing pains.  If however you are just a little bit of a fan or not very patient when it comes to dealing with bugs/glitches I would suggest you either pass on the game or simply wait a little while for a few more patches.  1.3 was a good start at fixing everything, but we probably still need 2 or 3 more patches like it.",1599868115,1600882846,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198065040102,42,1,10728,3869,2171,1601948763

I found this fix for the ""Crash on Start"" issue on the Steam Community threads that worked for me. If anyone else is having this problem , hopefully it fixes it for you too:

1. Close the game (if running)

2. Go to the Documents folder on your computer (usually C:\Users\ your local username \Documents)

3. Open the folder used by Marvel Avengers, and then open the folder named after your Steam64ID (17-digit)

4. IMPORTANT - Back up the archive files in that folder (for example, copy them to another folder)

5. After backing up the file, delete save1_1.dat, save1_2.dat and save1_3.dat

6. Rename savebk_1 to save1_1.dat, savebk_2 to save1_2.dat and savebk_3 to save1_3.dat.

7. Start the game again.

Original review: 

Fun while it lasted but after updating the game to ver 13.11 with the 1.3.0 patch, I finally encountered the memory leak issue that others have posted about (ver 12.11 had no issues) even though this patch was supposed to fix the issue. The game crashes to the desktop as soon as you click START/press A to enter the game after the intro cutscenes, making the game unplayable.

This problem, in addition to being unable to replay the main story missions after completion, should be a deal-breaker for many.... especially at this price point. Not recommended.",1600662740,1600868717,False,4,0,0.524923264980316162,0,True,False,False,76561198067302787,245,5,2728,48,2267,1601002494
39,76426874,english,"With over 300 hours in this game is not worth it. Wait a year and then they might have it together. Do not believe the social media blitz this game is hot garbage. Bad launch / a major patch that should have been completed prior to launch. A huge list of damaging bugs from losing unlocks and cosmetics to complete character wipes that are still happening. You will get about 12 to 20 hours of decent game play in the campaign (provided you are not having bugs). 

After getting to end game its just horrible. From bad AI of the team and enemies to horrible match making bugs. To poorly scaled difficulty and loot optimization. Load times / no way to reconnect on player dropping from game causing the entire team to back out and relaunch mission. Extra load screens, long ass elevator rides to random rooms that have no impact on the mission or objective the list can go on.

 I am not a person who writes reviews or a fan boy, i am just a gamer who has been so let down by this game that i felt i needed to post a review. 

This game has a lot going for it and could have potential to be a pretty awesome fun exciting marvel comic game but it currently very far from that. This is a paid beta IMO needs at least 6 months of polish on the end game and coop experience and current state i would not recommend purchasing.",1600867585,1600867637,False,2,1,0.519999980926513672,0,True,False,False,76561197981795096,77,2,19497,44,19452,1601006689

41,75469994,english,"Out of 10, I would give this a solid 6.5/10. Here's the reason why:

I would recommend this game for the story, dialogue and the combat. Great dialogue and banter between characters; the VA's did a great job making sure the emotions were felt in their delivery.

However, for gameplay not so much....It's good but it's also very buggy. I have ran into multiple bugs where sometimes the camera would not change back into the normal position. (Albeit at one point the camera was directly on Black Widow's butt, but I wasn't exactly complaining then.) The one thing I dislike about this game is that you can't switch characters mid-game. 

Sometimes you just wanna play your favorite heroes than them forcing Ms. Marvel into every mission. Like she's a good character and all, but I wanna play Iron Man/Hulk/ CA/ Thor as well. Like come on, how hard is it to make characters swappable. Also, some are hero specific missions, but if you want you can pick your fav hero, however, some chests become inaccessible as they don't have the same skillset to get into the room that has the chest. If you wanna break the door, you sometimes need a heavy attack from Hulk/Ms.Marvel/Hulkbustor armor (But that's on cooldown)

So if anything get it after they fix or buy it on sale. This game had really high expectations but it didn't completely deliver.

UPDATE(23/09/2020):

45,76422625,english,"NOTE-- I haven't finished the game at the time of this review, but I intend to eventually.

There are good ideas in this game, the plot is good and some of the characters are fun to play as, Iron man and Kamala Khan in particular. Other characters like hulk are very dull to play or lack a feeling of impact which thor also suffers with. The voice acting is acceptable although the well known voice actors take you out of the scene and a stronger direction would of helped this.

The biggest problem with this game is the core gameplay loop, the first 2-3 hours of the game are an introduction to the story which get you interested in where it will take you but it quickly slows down once you gain access to the main method of choosing missions, very similar to destiny's strike missions you choose a mission in a set location and complete a simple objective, hold this point, defeat x amount of enemies then the mission ends, you must do these to gain gear upgrades which are crucial to have enough power level for missions, however unlike destiny these upgrades are invisible and you see no physical change making them both dissapointing and hard to tell if they even made a difference. 

These strike missions are very dull with the same objectives and enemies constantly repeated with very little strategy required. As far as I can tell these missions will be the remainder of the game which is a shame.

The game starts well, and has a decent story but is massively let down by the core gameplay loop and mission structure, making earths mightiest heroes feel boring and weak, this doesn't even mention the in game cash shop, cosmetics or lack of variety available in the base game.

The gameplay is fun (when you actually can play) and the story is good. Once the campaign is done there are side-story missions and grinding, but that's any shooter-looter.  It's great to be able to use some of your favorite Marvel characters and fight with them.  Enemies, especially bosses or groups of mini bosses, provide enough difficulty to make it a challenge.   Gear takes more than just looking at power level, and skills acquired actually matter. The inclusion of pinning someone to a wall with Mjolnir or beating two enemies together with Hulk is amazingly and hilariously fun. Cap going Boston Beser...er Brawler mode is a treat as he just levels an area of enemies.  

But....

The game crashes.  A lot.  A LOT.  45 minutes into a mission and halfway through Abominations crazy high HP pool? Freeze up.  Quit via task manager. Middle of changing gear after only being in the game for 3 minutes? CTD.  Another game session play 4 missions in a row with no issue at all.  Sometimes audio just loses one character's voice.  You know Thor is talking to Jarvis, but you only hear one side of the conversation.  Or in the middle of a mission suddenly Hulk is making no sounds whatsoever.  Once the memory leaks begin (enemies begin to stutter in movement) you know you have a countdown until the crash happens.  Sadly that may be 1 or 40 minutes.  Slot machine crashes! 

Don't even bother with Co-op.  You'll watch your friend(s) fighting enemies you can't even see or hit, while the video hitches and stutters.

Thank you for your attempt bnut with these bugs and errors and mishaps this game really should not  have been pushed out. That being said Come November this IP will have more consoles and games to contend with. Its already lost a huge portion of players due to issues. Players that otherwise enjoyed the heck outta the game. So thats also why I worry. If some drastic changes and fixes dont come across next month this game will more than likely go the way of Anthem. Also dont tell me that twitch numbers arent indicative to to player base. In 2020 yes the hell they are.  The last I checked today, 16 days after official launch this game is sitting at sub 1k viewers.  Scary times my friends.   Scary times. Best wishes to all still playing.


Update:  Well as of today I had a corrupted profile. It then proceeded to erase all my upgrade mats and in game currency. Reset my faction levels to zero and reset Iron man to level 1.

69,76406777,english,"This is game absolutely fun all the way around! The story for me was very engaging and believable, I enjoyed every minute of it. 

First the graphics are absolutely amazing! Im only running a 1070TI with an I5 and 16GB RAM and this game looks superb! The music is definitely a plus. I think they got the genuine feel of super hero hype music.

Now onto combat. Overall i think the combat system is stellar! The movements and interactions between the player and enemies is fluid and seamless. The parries and blocks with each character is top notch; its not too easy but definitely not impossible to do, so I would say it presents a challenge when there are many enemies at once. However, its not without its issues. On occasion when doing takedowns your character and the enemy dont always line up. Its not gamebreaking but immersion breaking. 

The progression system is nice. Leveling is easy but gaining power not so much, that is if you want specific stats. There are a lot of skills to select from but I dont think they over complicate it. Everything seems to have a purpose and  with the masteries being selectable once unlocked you can have a lot of skill customization. Its really nice. 

As for bugs I have only experienced one. It was gamebreaking and to be honest if I do discover more bugs I would still give this a thumbs up because I believe this game has a lot of potential and I want to give it love so the DEVS give it love. Overall I LOVE THIS GAME!

I'm honestly shocked. The missions have you juggling between characters so often you never tire of the individual characters and gives you enough time with all characters to give you a real sense of who was your better play style. Each character has an insanely different combat approaches. 
Honestly people have focused heavily on the online multiplayer, which I admittedly haven't tried much of. But the single player itself is incredible. Yes it's a division style grind for gear but the story mode does not make that a priority for you to enjoy the game. It is only end game stuff that makes it necessary. I have played division and destiny and would say it's a very close style of gear loot. Nothing surprising or out of the ordinary, yet it was marked heavily down on this in reviews but destiny and division received praise for their use of gear? It all seems strange.

My gripes:

Not enough hero's (They are promising to add two new heros in the first two months)
Missions can seem very samey as the mechanics are very similar with either defeating a boss or destroying an object or stopping the hack terminals. Varied enough for now but will tire out quickly. I imagine they will add further mechanics later.
Biggest gripe for me is the bugs, when I bought this game it was unplayable most of the launch day and was repeatedly crashing throughout the week, random fly off glitches and various other issues. 
However, since then there has been a patch and a good 90% of my issues seem to be resolved. There is a thriving discord server for this game and everyone seems to be willing to help and assist with bugs/glitches (even the direct developers). They are nowhere near done with this game and it's clear they have high passion for what it will be.

If you're a marvel fan and that's the only reason you're playing maybe wait till it's on sale,

It really has its high points! You'll go through moments where it just sings, and each character's powers are super fun to use and everything is working perfectly-

And then you get shot in the back by a ******* ice beam from an offscreen enemy and are frozen for 3 seconds while you frantically mash X but it's too late because a pack of explode-y guys run up to you and keep exploding and stunlock you and you're dead.

92,76398570,english,"Marvel’s Avengers is the most disappointing game I have ever played and, regrettably, paid money for. If you enjoy Anthem or Destiny, you MAY enjoy this game, if you can also get past it’s mountain of faults. In my opinion, the Avengers and Marvel brands don’t match this format at all. I was hoping for and expecting a story-focused game with diverse characters, an interesting plot, and fun and unique gameplay. You get MUCH more that from the Lego Marvel games, Spider-Man, and the Batman: Arkham series.

Missions are repetitive, consisting of “stand in the circle and fight off waves of faceless enemies”, “fight off waves of faceless enemies while destroying obligatory objects of sinister intent that number in at least three”, or “fight off waves of faceless enemies because we told you to.” There are a whopping three boss fights in the hours-long campaign where you fight named characters. One is at the beginning and the other at the end. The characters are bland and boring, apart from MAYBE Kamala Khan. Dialogue is lifeless and too often purely expositional. Menus are hard to navigate and use a pointer you control with your analog stick. You have to grind to get XP or any useful equipment. The graphics are sharp and pretty to look at…in the trailer. During gameplay, faces disappear to show teeth and eyes hovering in an empty head, the audio and screen skip during cutscenes like a CD in an old portable CD player that you just kicked, and textures blur together (especially hair).

I know a lot of people want to play online with friends, but good luck with the lag and glitchy gameplay as soon as you get in. I had hope for this game, but it is nothing short of a grind-heavy cash-grab. This is my first review because no game has ever gotten my hopes up so high and then offended me with how bad it turned out to be before this one. Honestly, I turned it off and started playing through Spider-Man and the Batman: Arkham games again.

This game is beyond broken and unplayable. I have spent more than half of those 7.8 hours i ""played"" of this sorry excuse of a PC title adjusting and testing graphics settings inside the game just to see whether i would be able to play it for a few minutes without crashing. Never mind the inconsistent performance. The amount of ""workarounds"" i have had to try, to no avail, is beyond insulting to me as a consumer. This is a rushed and incomplete mess of a game. It suffers from various technical issues. From glaring stability issues (the game obviously suffers from a memory leak since it eats GPU memory eventually leading to a crash) to downright game breaking bugs that corrupt your saves games. People with dozens of hours are getting fucked out their time because of it. Read the forum and some of the negative Steam reviews on this. It's downright hard locking some systems!

Even the people giving this a positive review can't deny the numerous technical issues the PC version suffers from. Every one of these major titles ends up being a giant shitshow. Start labeling these rushed products appropriately if these ""AAA"" studios want to sell unfinished crap like this. You owe it to your customers, Valve!!!


Edit: Well. I got my refund even after 8 hours of ""playing"" this. 

Don't go through the automated system!

You need to submit a manual ticket and provide them with a detailed complaint.

When most people have issues with specs or crashing in new AAA games on steam, I usually dont, I'm a 10+ IT guy who always keeps his PC driver up to date and usually quickly figures out if something weird happens ( event viewer or online etc etc ) 

But this game crashes for no reason I can think of, in the middle of nothing particularly happening, it has happened enough times without any Direct X error or DLL error or any Event viewer issue that I think it's the game itself just bugs and stability issues.  This is one of the few AAA that I have had that many craches I would say about at least 1 crash per every 2 hour or so, I got about 60 hours so is about 30 crashes or so.. something like that. 

BUT the reason I recommend this game is because it has all the foundation pieces to be a fun Co Op game that people could be playing years from now. 

-- + -- IT has complex moves ( for a brawler I mean ) and very cool looking specials and animations, IT requires a certain degree of strategy on stronger fights acquire heroic orbs, health packs dodge, block jump out of the way, use range or time your heroics... etc. it's not rocket science but as far as brawlers are concern I think this is one of the mos well done mechanically. 

--+-- It has great voice acting, good character models and potential for some awesome cosmetic stuff and animations for example I love Division 2 got 400 plus hours on it but despite a few dances most cosmetic is just military sci fi stuff,  here you get cool looking ICONIC dresses from the comics cool liking alternate stuff, Emotes that can add fun to those elevator rides and comic book name plates that can add alittle extra 

--+-- leveling all your heroes means that differently from other game where you level the same character different job, this game you are literally just leveling every hero I think as the rooster grows this will give it a great deal of replay ability. 

The bad.. ill keep it short because I want to remain positive, massive amount of glitches through walls, characters dissapear, matchmaking is hit or miss, no form of PvP even in the virtual room could be interesting if they had added even a basic form of it, small hubs that you can't interct with your party in any way, most missions after maybe the first 50 + hours are just a variation of something you have seen before, And maybe my biggest gripe is ONLY Abomination and TaskMaster two C level villains ( TaskMaster is cool but honestly he is at best a B level guy and his skills work better when going against worlverine, Punisher, Captain, Deadpool people like that, Having him be the BOSS when you have like Thor and Hulk on the team seems just a bit out there for me. I think they should have had a few more B level villains ( if they are tring to save the A listers for DLC or special events ) that way even if they arn't all great more variety would have been fun. The mechanical bosses are cool I have zero complaints about those althou again they are repetitive after the first few times.

I think all of this can be fixed or improved where it becomes a fun casual Co Op game specially good for Comic and MCU fans.

2,76375292,english,"In the game's current state, I cannot recommend it to a friend. While the potential of this game reminds me of an amalgamation of Marvel Heroes/Destiny, the execution is just not there. Lets break it down shall we...

Game Crashes - Extreme feeling of uneasiness that at any moment your game will crash and your progress is lost. You constantly are reminded, why am I playing this right now? It's still broken and they aren't done fixing it. Forget exploring levels and collecting every chest you can because the game crashes randomly. This is after patch 1.3 too. Whether the level you were on has taken 45 minutes so far and you are stressed out about the win or the level just started and you have activated your heroic ability, thats gunna be a crash to desktop folks. If you want to progress, you feel like you are on a timer from SAW and you need to complete the objective as fast as you can. But even then, the mission complete scene often trigger's a crash to desktop. Its a crap shoot. At least the gear you accumulated throughout the level from enemy drops is saved to your inventory as you play. But that mission will need to be started over for it to count the completion. 

Bugs - Excited you unlocked that Voideater Ironman skin? Well, don't be because the skins relock sometimes. Whether it was earned through a drop or bought from the store, there's a chance it locks again. Clicking on things like the challenge card  tab to view your progress constantly glitches you to the purchase credits with real money page. Numerous tabs actually direct you to the buy credits page. BUT WAIT ABEL, I DON'T CARE ABOUT SKINS. Okay, how about this bug, lets say you are on a 1 hr 6 level gauntlet. Its finally level 6 and you are ready for it to be over, but you need to defeat everyone on the level. Imagine your surprise when the final bad guy spawned outside of the map. You can hear him, you might even be able to hit him once or twice. But you'll never complete the level. So you reload from your last checkpoint and do it again and again. It will take a few retries before you realize you won't complete it and turn it off if it doesn't crash to desktop first. 

Enemies - AIM was a refreshing take on enemies for the Avengers. I just didn't think it would be the only enemies... The synthoids and bad guys are repetitive when you are forced to replay the same story mode levels and missions as end game content. The depth of various robots and synthoids are nice but I am very excited for future updates where there are Hydra bad guys, human goons, brotherhood,  the hand, masters of evil, sinister 6. I think this complaint will get solved over time but I just can't help but notice it now. It reminds me of how every generic bad guy in the raft jail Ultimate Alliance 3 had one of 2 or 3 powers, wolverine claws and something else but worse since this is just robots. Shit gets old for a $60 AAA game. 

PS4 Spiderman Exclusivity - Sony paid the Developers for exclusive rights to Spiderman on PS4. They could have said no. They chose to say yes. As a PC player, this sucks. I own a ps4 pro but I don't want to sit on my console and play. I want to be able to jump on with my friends who are on my preferred platform. To lock a character to a platform is surprising and unfortunate. There are only 6 characters and adding arguably the most popular character in the franchise to a subset of players for money is gross. 


TLDR: Hardcore fan of Marvel? Missed Marvel Heroes? This game could be fun when they finish it but its basically still in beta. Give it a few months for polish and a few more updates.

Lose your progress there and you lose literally everything. 40 hours gone just like that due to the incompetence of the developers. 

That's only one problem though. So your game actually works and doesn't destroy all of your progress?

Gameplay and combat is fun but again missions are just too repetitive, characters are ok, mechanics are not too deep.

Loot is not fun, I dont mind not been cosmetic or changing your looks but the loot stats are just bad, you dont feel any stronger while you progress in the game and it is at very late game when you actually see a slight difference but you are never gonna feel like a superhero powerhouse. 
And the current content is VERY tedious you would think at least drops would be good but no, loot drops are terrible, current content is limited to 3 types of missions ""kill these, capture these, destroy these"" even when a mission is 'rescue someone"" is basically ""go and destroy these"" and endgame content is locked behing single player I guess because they can not even solve MM.

Get it on sale and in the future once the bugs are gone and perfomance is improved, once is a FULL game and not a Beta, hell this shit show could even be an alpha build is just not completed, get it when they had added more variety to missions and activities.

Crashes are still routine, and often happen on missions that won't pick up where you dropped.

You cannot leave the Quinjet, which means you cannot walk around in any of the outposts. The only way out is to quit to the menu screen and reload.

UPDATE 09/19/2020:
Not sure how it's possible, but somehow it got more difficult after a recent patch despite the patch notes suggesting otherwise. Instead of things killing you in 6 or 7 hits, it's down to 3 or 4. If you get stun locked, get ready to be downed.

It's about repeating the same three or four kinds of missions in four or five enviroments. And yes, all drop zone missions have the environment of 'inside'. It sounds boring as hell on paper, but where the game actually shines is in the gameplay itself.

There are 6 heroes, with the promise of more to come, and each of them plays uniquely of the other. It's real simple what to expect of the game when playing, so I have to keep the review simple, too.

Don't expect a drawn out story, though the characters are written well.
Don't ask me about the numerous spelling mistakes.
Playing Hulk is fun.
From what little I've played of the others, they are also fun.

If I could ask anything, it'd be consistent threat zone missions in each region, because I'm not a fan of the way cycling content is treated right now, due to the miniscule amount of threat zone missions available at certain times.

1) Very immersive story campaign where u would want to find out what happen next. All the cut scenes resembles MCU movies plot and the awesome graphics make it like watching MCU movies. The sound track music of this game is very much like a orchestra recording. There will be new story campaign coming out soon.

2) The gameplay looks like your typical hack and slash action combat, however if u really play it, it never feels the same. Different Hero different unique combat action. The awesome looking skills of each hero and different unique combo makes it very fun.

**3) For those that complaints that there is bugs, lack of content, please research who are the developer and the backed company before u throw in ur massive complaints. Crystal dynamics  , a subsidiary of Square Enix with themselves as publisher, backed by MARVEL; such a big 3 pillar company , this game will confirm be patches regularly and not to mentioned end-game content already out. With new playable hero with their story mode coming out, i don't know why u are not hype unless u are not MARVEL fans. 

4) A very unique RPG action where it is not pay to win as the in-game items are all cosmetic where u can also earn them thru gameplay.

5) Worth the 80 bucks (SGD), as mentioned, big pillar developer + a lot of future content.You would want to play now and the more u wait the more time you will reach end-game and miss out of lot of stuff.",1600755825,1600755998,True,1,0,0.451485782861709595,0,True,False,False,76561197993433857,19,1,4415,2515,1429,1602065001

I love both Marvel and Square Enix, this games hype is amplified at everyones desire to have an open world Avengers game since the first Avengers movie came out. However there are some disgruntled views on the game, and I can see why. This game does not run as well as it should. I've had to tweak settings in game and using Nvidias control panel, it still runs with erratic behavior and honestly does not look great compared to how it was shown. Controller support is supposed to be present, but doesn't work properly unless you disable your controller support in steam settings? True that and it didn't work, i'm sure they will fix that easily, but that's still an annoying issue upon launch. This is a prime example of the type of game that should have had nothing but time and effort to make sure this game was flawless, and believe me you can see the potential. But for whatever reason, this game falls so short of being great. 

The game starts out wonderful, the campaign was awesome, and granted some of the vocal scripts are a bit cheesy/forced, it felt like something you can invest in emotionally. Overall a well thought out Avengers Tale. HOWEVER, let me tell you, after the campaign, it drops into absolute limbo. All you do are challenges and help other people with challenges/missions. The proclaimed task of upgrading/rebuilding the Helicarrier is fake, it's just you doing campaign until BAM, the helicarrier is all of a sudden up and running after a simple mission or two. Combat is imbalanced as certain fights just do not make you feel heroic or like you deal any significant damage outside 1v1's and gear feels like it doesn't matter at all in the long run. 

The fact that there is little to no focus on open world sandbox combat/interaction tailored to resemble something like the Battle of New York in the first Avengers movie, is a huge waste of potential in my opinion.

I feel bad for leaving a negative review, because I actually enjoyed the voice acting and script. Unfortunately the game was expected to be more than that. It does not run or hold it's visual integrity like a current generation title. I'm truly sorry, but this game only gives a small fraction of the Avengers experience we have all been craving.",1599726822,1600750010,False,1,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,False,76561198013752495,482,11,2006,236,1753,1601969787

Take that in for a minute.  2 hours in a mission only to walk away with some materials and no gear.  Top top this off this is all Single Player and the reason for me  was to play with my friends.

In the only currently available game where you can play as Thor, Iron Man, Hulk, and Captain America I really wanted to love this game. While it is fun and enjoyable when it works, there are completely gamebreaking bugs, annoying glitches. I have had to replay the story twice due to a loading screen bug that wouldn't allow campaigns to load on the last mission, after an unexpected error crashed during the cut scene the mission disappeared from the war table with the objective pointer randomly landing in an inaccessible area outside of the Helicarrier...

Furthering this are lighting glitches which see drastic shifts in brightness indoors, random crashes (even on a high-end gaming PC), enemies falling through floors, yourself falling through floors etc... 

Overall, it feels like the developers rushed to release something, the story is lackluster and predictable, the combat, while can be fun, is nothing more than a hack and slash style with some dodging and special abilities  thrown in. It feels as though a load of systems have been simply mashed together, the loot/gear system of Destiny, the combat system of GOW, Divisions online focused play (without the open world free roam). NPCs randomly float in the air (the ones that aren't supposed to), glitch out of the way or into you, the camera style doesn't really suite the combat giving for some really unhelpful viewing angles. 

A major flaw in the game itself is that this game doesn't seem know what it wants to be other than popular.

I find the deeper you get into your hero of choice the more you actually feel like a hero, hulk tends to feel more like the immovable object he should be, Ironman has more toys and feels suited for more situations, and Thor my boy Thor is fun as hell to play. i was concerned early on as the ""heros"" felt like nothing more than sidekicks before you get Deeper (Giggity) into the trees.

The performance is the absolute worst I've experienced in my life... and I thought the new Flight Simulator & Horizon Zero Dawn were bad. They don't even come close. I'm talking not just frame rates- but crashes, bugs, glitches, memory leaks are all rampant throughout a play through. I generally need to restart hourly (which is crazy considering how long load times are even on an NVME SSD). 

The combat itself feels really good with the exception of stun-locking and ""spin"" enemies (which drain all your mana/energy with one hit and arenas are littered with them)- nothing more deflating then being The Hulk and getting stun-locked by human sized robots then dying... as The Hulk... because you have no energy to get health back with or armor from. Between that stuff and the enemies that literally ""BLOCK"" every single thing you do (while you get stun-locked and die from a sneeze... as The Hulk) it really takes the fun out of it. But the important part is the foundation is there for combat to be great.

But this grind... when coupled with the fact that you could lose an hour's work after going through 13 of 14 floors of a hive that all look and play exactly the same because we all paid to be beta testers in this Anthem 2.0 dumpster fire... it's just too much.

And the trend seems to, unfortunately, continue. 2018's Spiderman for the PS4 oozed with passion and excitement. Its devotion to the source material and, most importantly, dedication to making sure that the player's having fun created one of the best comic book games since Arkham. The team went all out, featuring an array of enemy types and bosses. Every major Spiderman villian's in the game aside from two, saved for a sequel, but the package's already bursting at the seams. All of that brings us to Marvel's Avengers. It's a game made for a bottom line. It has an admittedly solid foundation, but no one buys a house where the walls are crumbling simply because the 'foundation's solid.' I've had a relatively smooth experience, but that doesn't excuse all the problems others are having. The internet as a whole is a testament to the broken mess of a prototype, pushed out by Square for a quick buck, that this is.

My friend can't play the game unless he clicks the start button fast enough. There's no rejoin or drop in, cloud saves weren't even turned on by default, gear perks can make for fun builds, but beyond, due to level scaling, you're stuck in a perpetual mid-tier hell without much say over the challange. First piece of endgame content is for singleplayer and doesn't even work half the time, with numerous players receiving gear for lvl 1 despite needing to be max lvl in order to start the thing.

Pros

[list]
[*]Combat diversity. There's a character and build for every playstyle.
 [*] Voice acting is great, even if Nolan North still sounds like Nolan North, lol.
[*] Decent amount of characters to pick from with more to come in the coming months.

[/list]

Cons
[list]
[*]Performance. This is the top of the list of cons because of how poorly my performance is. I've had fights where it's like watching a slideshow because of HUGE fps drops. I'm running everything on low and still struggle to get even decent fps. My system is i5 6600k, 1070, 16GB RAM. So I should easily be able to play the game at low graphic settings at 1080p resolution.
[*]Crashes. Yeah, these are so annoying. Game completely crashes to desktop during missions and having to start them again is a massive pain. Even the recent patch that was supposed to fix these did nothing.
[*]Getting stunlocked by enemies so far away I can't even see them on my screen. Getting hit by other enemies while you're in an animation with another enemy is a huge issue. 
[*]Bugs and glitches during missions, especially the missions will multiple floors and take a while to complete. 
[*]Exclusive outfits and missions for Playstation. Sure, it's only a monthly exclusive but why the special treatment? Other platforms pay the same for the game.

At this moment I can't recommend this game to people. Uninstalled for now. Might come back in a couple of months to see if they've fix the game where it's in a playable state and I don't have to worry about wasting time in a mission only to crash near the end.

Launchpad had a saying after every crash... ""Any crash you can walk away from is a good crash"". That may all be well and good for morale, but no for any video game.

Having to tinker with settings, overlays, rolling back drivers, dealing with customer support to work on getting the game playable etc. isn't something you should have to deal with in a AAA game.

Sure, the game may be patched into a reasonable state. But what will be left of the player base by the time that happens and with no cross play available?

I'd say hold off on purchasing right now just to save yourself a potential headache and keep on eye on the patch progress.

6,76318952,english,"I'll start this review off by saying that I'm not unhappy that I purchased it, however there are too many little glitches and bugs for me to honestly suggest anyone goes out and buys it. For example, I just did my first ""HIVE"" mission, and after working my way through it for roughly 30 minutes the game decided it was time to take a little break and crashed. No error message, no overheating CPU... just a casual force close. I'd also love to say tat this was the first time that happened, but it's really a daily issue now.

Now, with the negativity out of the way, something I'm sure will be resolved sooner rather than later, the game is immersive, definitely a little repetitive but I'm not mad at that aspect. The characters are engaging, I enjoy playing all of them to the point that you'll binge of Cap then switch to Widow or Hulk and suddenly remember how much fun the other characters are.

The missions are cookie cuter and the enemies are interesting, there are enough that it doesn't just become click and forget. The graphics are good without being amazing and the voive acting is... good. Thor is his usual hilarious self.

The major ""issue"" with the game is just the character models, I can understand that using the movie likenesses would've cost mega money but still... a couple of them just look weird. The voices are a little jarring in the beginning. 

All in all I'd give it a 7/10 with that going up to a 9 when they resolve the weird crashing issue (not to mention the tiny little ones that seem to happen - getting stuck on invisible steps so you need to jump to ""escape"" etc).

Lastly, a little bit of additional info on the chapter progression wouldn't go amiss, it may just be me but I've watched a lot of walk-through videos just to understand what a certain step means... again that could just be me.",1600673438,1600673438,False,4,0,0.525722980499267578,0,True,False,False,76561198006259744,76,2,4959,2340,2509,1601725808
7,76318921,english,"I'll start with the good.  There's the skeleton of a great game here, the combat is fun, the gameplay mechanics are solid, the ideas already in place for loot and progression are not fully fleshed-out, but they are interesting.  As of this writing I have sunk 95 hours into the game, so I have certainly gotten some of my money's worth out of it.  The campaign is fantastic... it's really something special, and I enjoyed it thouroughly.  

Now for the bad... and there's a lot, so if you want the TLDR version:  check back in a year or two, but DO NOT buy this game right now... it is inexcusably buggy.  I have genuinely not had a single session of playing without some sort of glitch.  Anyone else remember how glitchy Skyrim or the Fallout games were?  THIS GAME IS SOMEHOW WORSE.  Not only are the glitches more frequent, but they aren't cosmetic/harmless like the majority of Skyrim glitches were (guards halfway through walls, weird physics stuff...).  No no... these glitches are game-breaking.  From straight-up crashes (several dozen now in just a few days) to characters stuck: floating, falling, climbing, spinning in mid-air over a railing/edge/box/etc... to technicolor garbled graphical errors & nonsense, audio bugs where suddenly there's just no sound for certain actions... and a game so poorly optimized that I see the FPS drop to the low 20s, running it at --LOW SETTINGS-- on the following PC: i7 7700K, 16GB DDR4, GTS 1080 TI.  **FPS IN THE 20s**  The same PC that runs Red Dead Redemption 2 at ultra settings, on 3440x1440 resolution, at a consistent 80-100 FPS, can't run this game at LOW SETTINGS and 2560x1080 ?!?  Seriously?!? 

Crystal Dynamics decided to focus on the campaign (which, again, is really great) and spent ZERO time doing basic bug-testing and optimization for the Avengers Initiative endgame content... they focused-on & perfected the guided experience, which in a game like this is theoretically only just the start... since the VAST majority of your playtime will be spent in that endgame content, this is effectively like releasing a game where the tutorial works perfectly, and the rest of the game crashes, glitches, randomly sends your character into orbit, or through a wall into the abyss... I said it before, and it bears repeating, because there's no better way to put it; 

Releasing this game, in this state, was inexcusable.  

And how are they addressing all these bugs?  Well, they released a MASSIVE patch that they hyped-up, stating it had ""[bug] fixes for more than 1,000 issues"".  That patch came out 2 or 3 days ago, it had a few dozen patch notes in point-form, which somehow equates to ""1,000"" bugs fixed in their minds (how that math works may explain why this game is so goddamn buggy in the first place).  I am pretty sure the game has glitched MORE in the time since the ""1,000"" bugs were fixed, than it did prior to the patch.  Their response to this cratering Steam score and, from what I can see, hundreds and hundreds of very angry Reddit posts in the official Reddit thread, is to continually tweet out PR nonsense, self-congratulatory rhetoric, direct responses to a LARGE number of flattering tweets, and a VERY small number of cut-and-paste sort of ""please continue to report these bugs"" replies.  That's assuming they'll be tweeting out anything at all, any time soon, since as of this writing there hasn't been a single tweet sent out, or any sort of official response in the Reddit thread, for about 2 days.

Lastly I would like to say that I am in my 40s, and have been gaming as long as gaming has existed.  I was gaming before the internet was even a thing and in the entirety of my gaming life I have provided direct feedback about a specific game maybe a dozen times total.  Those instances were either games that were so incredible they deserved to have their praises sung in some way, or they were games where I had encountered a very specific and SINGULAR technical issue which was preventing my progress.  No joke, less than 10 times.  So when I spend my time writing a rant this lengthy, please understand that I do so because [b][u]this has been the single most frustrating gaming experience of my entire life[/b][/u].  Never before have I played a game with such promise, that in its current state is just so, so very bad.  I truly meant it when I said check back in a year.  The vast majority of these ""games as platforms"" have become something really amazing with around a year of development/refinement, and I bet this will be no different, but if you buy it now you will be frustrated, disheartened and... like me... will be uninstalling it until some proper fixes are made.",1600673340,1600673340,False,4,0,0.525722980499267578,0,True,False,False,76561198049913816,99,2,8057,1852,5663,1602081288

15,76311899,english,"I think I've nailed down what the big problem is with this game.  It's the itemization.  I think the whole, pay for credits to get new suits thing doesn't work for most.  First, of all there are very few suits I would like to get.  Most just aren't that good.  Second, when you are farming your brains out, getting new drops and they visually do -NOTHING- for your character you feel...bored.

I think they could have implemented new item drops that may not have changed  the appearance of things not necessarily all the time, but sometimes.  For example, maybe Cap's shield could get a  color scheme with some drops, while other times you get the old Generation style shape.  I would even go out on a limb and suggest things that maybe didn't appear in comics to make the shield look different, even if it's just slightly so.
Same thing with helmets, arm braces, chest pieces.  

All could had had slightly different appearance and sure, getting all of the same set would end up with you getting a new complete look.  This, I think, would have made the farming more...not boring.

Aside from the itemization, the second problem is the bad guys.  Mostly robots.  Yawn.  I'm sure they have plans for more baddies, but launching your game without some cool baddies is a mistake.  I'm going to assume there's more to come but at launch, it's a snooze-fest.  

Right now, I'll go in on my free time, do a mission or two while searching the Steam pages for something else to play.  There's A LOT of work that needs to be done here and if the game is successful enough to remain supported it might be great in a year, maybe two.

You earn XP through challenges to fill the card which is basically like the seasonal format for Fortnite or Destiny 2, but your limited to how much xp towards it daily and weekly making you feel like you need to spend money to get stuff unlocked faster.

45,76082211,english,"This game is by no means bad, really it's fun and enjoyable
I like the combat, every character feels like their own unique playstyles.

However what brings this game downhill is the repetitive level design, you fight the same guys way too much there is no variety in mission except that one releasing prisoners mission that's for one really cool.

the lack of bosses is absurd, 6 bosses in the entire game, and only half of them are actual recognizable characters from Marvel, the others are just robots that nobody cares about. Hell, even the last fight felt flat and dull, I finished this game with the feeling of ''Finally I don't have to play the campaign anymore''.

Speaking of the campaign, the cutscenes are unbearable, they just stutter and are out of sync from the audio and it really killed the story for me, I've never wished for superhero game cutscene to have the least amount of movement out of fear from these ridiculous issues.

I really hate this gear system because all it changes is stat numbers and a little perk that comes with it to add ''variety'' while all it does is just extra damage or more resistant, the numbers of the stats do this job already, the gear also doesn't change the character model, makes it even more dull to begin with.

And what I despise the most here is the grindy aspect of the game, the challenge card (or just a battle pass at this point), they should've made these rewards in this battle pass unlocked by leveling up the certain hero, not by playing the same damn mission OVER AND OVER AND OVER and call it a CHALLENGE, Seriously there was a challenge that told me to beat the exact same thing 10 times. Not to mention this game sometimes takes 15 minutes (not a joke) to load, and even after it loads, it still fails to process textures correctly and if that's not enough the frames will drop like crazy.

It pains me to not recommend it like everybody else because in fact I was really excited to play it, and thought some of the criticisms this game has taken were just nitpicky, honestly the game isn't really that bad, but these technical issues really can destroy the FUN in games.

They did fix the issue with the missing skill points, but only if you haven't already leveled the character, in which case you're apparently shit out of luck, my Ms. Marvel for instance is still missing 2 skill points, not the ""missing 1 skill point"" that they're claiming was the issue.",1599956990,1600616844,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197993244319,245,9,4631,349,4282,1601228361

Wow did this patch make all the difference most of the bugs and glitches CTD,save problems,gfx glitches, camera problems all seem to be fixed this is a complete turn around compared to its release on PC the dev team really made true on the promises the community managers made, the fps drops do still occasionally happen but not after 30-40 mins like before but a good few hours. 

I cannot comment on the multiplayer connection issues ect as i have not played this in coop mp yet, performance wise this game is a lot better now, game play wise well the constant stun lock seems to happen a lot less now as they fixed a problem causing to many of a certain enemy to spawn, and the combat is smoother now and more enjoyable. 

My thoughts on content well i know its just been released but i feel the content does seem to be a little lacking it does get a little tedious fighting A.I.M all the time, i hope they have plans to introduce more enemy factions with there own storylines in the future, they have loads to choose from, there also needs to be more activities  iv played a few looter grind type games, borderlands, Destiny 2, Division 1&2 , Anthem, to name a few and even these games had more things to do on release (ok maybe not Anthem), iv mentioned the more factions but they really need to introduce more villains as bosses there is 6-7 in the game at the moment you fight in the campaign and only three of them are truly iconic villains the others are a form of A.I.M mech, warship or war droid. 

Overall though this patch is a big turn around and hopefully the devs keep this momentum going and do the game justice like it deserves just don't expect Hundreds of hours worth of game play with the current amount of content. i want to change my recommend to a yes but i can not because of the lack of content.

It is not all doom and gloom though this is a live service game i know your asking how can i say that its not doom and gloom for a live service game im an optimist ok its a hugh ip owned by Disney and how we love to hate them they do protect there ips they reined EA in over the loot box shit storm in Battlfront i really can not see them letting SE ruin one of there franchises that is raking them in tons of money right now i hope there is tons of content to come if and when it does and its positive i will come back and change this review to a yes recommend. (i have also left my original review below this updated one for people to read if you wish). 

ORIGINAL REVIEW

The state this game is in right now on PC i cannot recommend it to anyone and its following the trend of all AAA games released nowadays unfinished, untested, a buggy mess and ported over to PC in a very poor state. 

I am both angry and disappointed, angry because i cant get a refund, in my country i can legally get a refund after 2 weeks since buying the product as long as iv not used it or before going over 2 hours of game play, disappointed in myself for buying into the hype like i did with anthem. 
The beginning part of the game took me 2 hours and guess what it ran smoothly and i was hopeful for this game the only thing two things that annoyed me was the sensitivity i play with mouse and keyboard have my mouse on 400 dpi and the in game sens turned down to the lowest which is 1 and its still to sensitive for me, and the way in which the camera follows you it seems off to me and it felt weird in combat, but they were the only problems i had and i can live with these minor things as they were a me problem.

The real problems started when you get into what i would call the real start of the game which is  past the 2 hour game play stage and a goodbye to my refund and wow the bugs didnt trickle in they poured down starting with the games auto save failing to create saves and there is no way to manual save, so your going to lose progress, the CTD (Crash to Desktop) these happened alot and are still happening, starting the game up press the start button game CTD, finally get into the game playing a mission game CTD, FPS (Frames Per Second) constantly drops to 1 FPS i noticed this happens every time a new enemy spawns in (this is more noticeable in the H.A.R.M Room) and during the big fights this really is a problem.

Another thing in big fights is your character becoming unresponsive to controls, not dodging or parrying dodging in the opposite direction in which you want it to go, for some reason it keeps dodging me into another incoming enemy instead of away, i have 12 hours playing this game and iv only just finished the mission to go get tony stark which really should not of taken me that long at all but due to all the progress lost the constant fps drop and CTD iv been taking 1 step forward three steps backwards. 

These are not the only problems mega bug threads in most social media sites and forums with people reporting tons of bugs can be found if you dont find my review trustworthy, but with all that bad which there is alot of there seems to be a silver lining the devs are listening and the community support team have been in constant communication with us and updating us on progress made to sort these bugs out (Thank you MeaganMarie). 

Not everyone has been plagued with these problems though and alot of people have had nothing but smooth game play and a great experience this review is only on my experiences and my opinions, so to finish off i  personally in good conscience cannot recommend this game to anyone at the moment.

EDIT I tried getting a refund for this game however it was refused even after i wrote a lengthy explanation saying how the time i racked up was spent on trying to get the game to run properly to run smoothly between the CTD, i dont liking wasting money so will continue to play this game and get my moneys worth, i still cannot recommend this game to anyone until they sort out the performance issues on PC and sort out some of the obvious game play issues it has.",1599795327,1600613383,False,2,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197971412047,164,2,10177,4773,735,1601989287

Other than constant crashes the game has been enjoyable. Hopefully they fixes these issues soon.

---UPDATE Patch 1.3---
It amazes me how they are able to release AAA games in this state. Even with a ~3+ gig patch there are still performance issues. At this point it's clear that the end game is pretty much non-existent with very little variability in content. I personally feel that they promised way more than they could deliver. 

Knowing what I know now, I would tell my past self to STAY AWAY or request an immediate refund until this game is in a better state.

I still have hope that eventually this game will be what was promised, but I will not be holding my breath.

87,75656467,english,"Let me preface this review by stating outright that I don't recommend this game because of technical issues, I'm otherwise enjoying it quite a lot.

Let's start with the good:

- Decently-long campaign with an original story, lots of references to the comics, and a lot of fun moments.
- All the characters play in a unique, interesting way. They each have an ""intrinsic"" bar that charges and can be spent to do cool stuff in combat, and each character has 3 abilities that charge separately.
- Multiplayer for when you're done with the campaign and wanna play with other people.
- Upcoming content is apparently free, including new characters, so that's pretty dope.

And now the bad:

- This game is buggy as all hell. Faces will contort, hair will fly into the floor, your allies will fall infinitely, sometimes enemies don't spawn, it's pretty bad atm.
- Horrible optimisation. It feels like the game barely offloads anything onto your GPU. I constantly sit at 100% CPU usage and something like 0.4% GPU usage. Changing the graphics doesn't change the performance at all. This is after ~7 fixes posted online, which very slightly helped.

tl;dr: Gameplay fun, devs please fix your game.

Edit: As of 19/09/20 there's been a performance patch. The game definitely runs a little bit better, but it's still kind of a joke. 100% CPU, 5% GPU, changing settings still does nothing.

Matchmaking is still a huge issue. To reliably player with others you need friends or go to Discord and invite them through Steam Friends. And so far, even that has been working 100% all the time. 

In short, the main game, the multiplayer isn’t completely working as of yet. You have to play a lot alone with rather dull AI companions that inconsistently use their skills. If there is a side-door you can’t open but your AI companion could, tough luck you aren’t able to open this door.

Yes, I have finished the campaign and playing on Initiative. I have never been so angry trying to play a simple game mode in my life. Tried to refund the game but unfortunately I could not.

Multiple crashes, no warnings - one minute your smashing robots with Thor the next second your staring at the desktop.  Totally at random it could be seconds in or hours - making playing the game a nerve-racking experience as you can never be sure if you'll complete the level before it crashes. 

The campaign - while an enjoyable, well written experience - was also bug ridden.  Loss of audio during cutscenes, animation lip sync not working and my personal favourite - a save game corruption which resulted in an endless loading screen that required a massive spoiler workaround to continue.

Literally no point in me mentioning multiplayer.

16,75897143,english,"tl:dr - I enjoyed the campaign, the recent patch has made combat less frustrating in terms of ranged enemy spam and impossible hit indicators. I'd still probably wait to grab it in a sale though.

Pros
* I love the story, and the interaction of Ms Marvel with the other Avengers
* All of  the characters feel different enough to enjoy playing without feeling like you're doing the same moves with a different skin
* Everything looks amazing, and you feel awesome when you destroy groups of enemies and start unleashing your heroic abilities
* The combat is challenging, it is loosely comparable to the Arkham style, with enemies using different coloured attacks that require either dodging or blocking/parrying. The big difference is that it is a lot faster. Enemies will not wait their turn and will happily dog pile you, or snipe you with rockets and lasers whilst you're busy pounding their buddies. The hit indicators are also very strict, you often have a fraction of a second to hit the dodge or block buttons before they land.

Cons
* There are a bunch of bugs in the game, most are just odd to see but there are few that will kill a mission, such as AI companions refusing to revive you because you're on a ledge 2ft above them
* The matchmaking/multiplayer needs work. I may be wrong on this, but it seems that you can only join games before they launch into a mission. This means that either everyone has to sit in the lobby matchmaking, with no idea if anyone else is even playing the same mission. Or just steam ahead with AI companions with zero chance of anyone else joining. Allowing people the option to join missions in progress would help solve this, a simple pop-up or option that there is a mission in progress you can join when selecting the mission would be fine
* [strike]Combat indicators don't feel perfect. As mentioned above, when in combat you typically have a number of ranged enemies firing at you. A lot of these attacks are lasers or other insta-hit abilities and most of the time, there is no warning indicator for it. Making it a very frustrating experience when you're trading blows with 3 guys, expertly dodging and parrying, and a rocket slams into your back wiping out half your health[/strike][b]Recent patch seems to have sorted this, I feel like I'm dodging and blocking attacks much more consistently now.[/b]
* [strike]Which leads to my next point, ranged enemies need some tweaking. At the start of most large fights, there will typically be 5-6 turrets firing bullets, lasers or rockets at you. A similar number of ranged guys doing the same, with the addition of elemental attacks that will freeze you in place, or drain your heroic energy, and then a group of melee guys (who also typically have some heavy ranged attacks). This means that a lot of the time, the early stages of a fight involve running in circles behind cover whilst you pick off the turrets and ranged guys as quickly as possible, which just feels really out of character. Some kind of balance needs to be added here. This issue is most noticeable when playing Solo, as the AI companions don't tend to draw aggro, I imagine when playing with others having Iron Man or similar focusing on neutralising the ranged threats whilst the heavy hitters jump in the melee would probably work ok as it is[/strike] [b]Recent patch has made this much better. Ranged enemies are ""less aggressive"". Feels like the projectiles move a tiny bit slower.[/b]
* You have to salvage each piece of gear individually. I don't understand why every single game of this type releases without a way to mark items as junk and mass-salvage and then patches it in later",1599987948,1600590178,True,1,0,0.527559041976928711,0,True,False,False,76561197972309711,690,20,3176,0,3067,1600617134

Campaign seems limited ... it's over relatively quick, with heroes at around level 10 (max level 50 at game's release.)

19,76213612,english,"[EDIT: running  a 4.2GHz I7, not 3.4GHz]

Clocking in at soon 40 hours of playtime I find the game fun and it keeps pulling me back.

There are some quirks that did drive me nuts, as in travelling to outposts or swapping characters during parts of the campaign that were not character locked story wise.

Reports of people having bigger problems seem to revolve around Ryzen chipsets and possibly RTX 20XX graphic cards and overclocking. I would recommend to run on a clean system with no overclocking or similar tools. This does in my book come true with all games as such tools often add instability to the system.

Graphically beautiful and running good on a decent system (I7 @ 4GHz, GTX1080TI with 11GB no overclocking, 32GB RAM) I sometimes see FPS drop with everything on maximum, resulution 3440x1440 ultrawide - but as I am playing solo it is not really a bother and I am perfectly fine with 50FPS.

The game has a lot of promise, but this means equally many ways to FUBAR it. Launch issues are being ironed out by the DEV and they are aware of some issues and working on them. While patching does not occur daily it also shows that they are focussing on ironing out several issues instead of one at a time.

In short:

+great campaign story (though with narrative shortcomings, like a movie that needs to be cut down to fit 2 hours of screenplay)
+great voice acting (english version!)
+beautiful graphics and animations
+plenty action
+varied characters and skills
+varied gameplay for each character (confusing in the beginning, adds variety though as you're not merely ""swapping a character skin for another"")
+LEWT!
(+the promise of free updates and characters in the future)

-clunky menus (using keyboard & mouse) - it seemed even worse to me using a controller
-short campaign
-only one real super villain in the campaign (MODOK)
-some normal humans able to two-shot you (teleporting railgunners and homing rocket launchers)
-very basic party AI
-what does all that LEWT actually do? You don't seem to ""feel"" if an item is an upgrade or not

The end game mostly consists of Hives, a multi floor stage of various tasks.  They take so long to do and don't feel like they reward you properly for your time that you spend on them.  I think that is the reason most other rpgs or other games tend to make multi floor dungeons side content and not the whole game.

On one of the positives of this game, each character after you level them up a bit, feels different in their own little ways.  You have the hulk that can grab enemies and use them as weapons. Black widow who can stealth around while taking out groups of enemies and has guns to take out range foes.  Iron man that has access to pulsars, lasers, and rockets that each have their own uses.

26,76247260,english,"There is no true single player. You play custom multiplayer missions that form a story. Your team will be filled by AI. If you disconnect from the server, you restart the mission, just like in a multiplayer game.

The excessive animations for some characters will make you get stuck evading in the wrong direction. Inputs will get lost. Others will be delayed. Attacks will go wildly off-screen when you are trying to break an object directly in front of you, while holding W. Disable virtually everything related to camera and lock on and you won't struggle as much. The camera POV will get stuck during conversation transitions - I got to stare at Window's butt for about 10 minutes of wandering around the ship running into corners. So much fun...

The ""open"" maps don't feel right. The ""city"" maps feel better, but you still know you're in a sandbox.

The hanger bay of the carrier is excessively time consuming to navigate. Why do level designers put things in the hardest to reach places? You created the map. You decided where the NPC will be. You are an asshole. It's worse than traffic - so much wasted time just so you can pad your game's play time? It's ridiculous. Games like Warframe, who do this correctly, are too few. You can access everything through a menu and you get instantly teleported to the location. If you want to walk, you can literally spin in a circle in your ship and reach pretty much everything you will need to do between missions. Destiny 2 wasn't too bad, but they are definitely on the verge by splitting their hub into 2 sections (fast travel helps). What I recall of Anthem was horrid, but not as bad as WoW and other traditional MMORPGs.

Flight is abhorrently bad. If you use hold to sprint, the tiniest bump will cause you to go into flight mode. Want to jump while sprinting? NOPE - into flight mode you go! I played the training and the first mission for iron man and thor and will never touch them again. It's very frustrating to always end up in flight mode, just hovering and attacking the air for 3 seconds until your animations catch up to your inputs and the game finally lets you drop down to the ground. It's unfortunate, as iron man's ground combat is probably the most enjoyable in the fame (when you can keep him there).

Even with someone as nimble, quick, and fun as Widow, I would not use the word responsive to describe her controls.

Some missions need level restrictions. There is no reason to throw 8 turrets, 6 snipers, 6 rocket guys, a dozen fodder, and a slew of teleporting shielded guys (all of whom constantly re-spawn off screen without any noticeable sound) at me when it's my 3rd mission with that character at level 4 and I'm still figuring out why I keep going into flight mode for no reason. The ramp up to this game is non-existent.

The enemy target priority is complete non-sense when playing solo. A group of 8 enemies will spawn, surrounding your group of 4. At least 6 of them, including every ranged enemy, WILL be targeting you. Being stun-locked by enemies is a thing in this game and it doesn't feel good. If you don't have your 3 ready, just go ham and let your team deal with it when you die. It's not worth the time or headache. Just have fun, refresh your drink, and move on.

Since this is an ""end game"" focused RPG (I guess...), there are factions to grind rep for and special missions that pop up (drop zones?). These missions are WELL above your current level and have no business being shown to you. I really hate how studios are all doing this. I don't want endgame content in my campaign. By the time I finish the campaign, I will already loathe the faction grind and be bored by the repetitive missions.

Oh, turn off Bloom, camera shaking, screen effects, and tone down VFX. There is so much on screen, but even without that, target acquisition is a major issue and changing these settings will make things a bit clearer.

Unfortunately, like many of its kind this is a 6/10 game with the potential to be 9/10.

I probably won't be playing this much until they decouple the evade direction from the direction the animation is moving (I should always evade based on the direction of my keyboard input).

Destiny w/ Marvel Characters

Combat is in the style of say a fighting game , where they give you all the basic tools ( once you level your character and unlock them in the skill tree) and it's up to you to use them together to form combos. Juggling in this game is satisfying like in Tekken. I would love to see the roster in this turn into say , Marvel Ultimate Alliance 3.   I enjoy the game and do suggest it to people , but only if they  are willing to put in the work on each character when it comes to combat. ( you can spam light and heavy attacks if you want , but it's not going to be satisfying and you're going to complain about it like you work at kotaku)

Sony does not own the rights to Spider-Man in video games, comics or merchandise.
Nintendo paid a ton of money to make Marvel Ultimate Alliance 3 on the switch only , Sony paid a ton of money to get  Spider-man in this game. Yes , it sucks. But, we don't know how long that exclusive is.

My Complaints:
1. I've only had 4 crashes, but some people are having a lot more, devs seem to be working hard on fixing this stuff so it's a positive but still sucks.
2.  There should be a giant passive skill tree that goes along with the ingame comics you collect ( gives you a reason to get XP after hitting max cap of level 50)
3.  Forcing you to use characters you don't want to campaign 
4.  Only having 1 hero in the party ( say you and your friend both love the Captain America , well , only one of you can play him together)

1. Character designs are fun and dynamic when the game works. Quick Note: this game rarely works. 
2. The campaign is decent and is a solid 10 hour length. Quick Note: it cannot be replayed so it is once only. 

Cons:
1. The worst loot system in any loot based game I have ever played. Exotic items that are weaker than lower tier items, gear barely affects your gameplay or strategies, grinding top tier gear is boring as all hell, gear stats and comparisons are vague and unexplained. 

2. Combat is a mess. Enemies that can stun lock infinitely until you die, enemies that can drain your powers making you unable to defend yourself, enemies that completely invalidate the otherwise fun character kits. These issues are not bugs but are in fact intended gameplay features. 

3. Severe performance issues. Even when running this game on a PC well above recommended specs expect to have all your graphics settings set to the lowest possible setting and for constant frame drops and rendering issues even after you do that. 

4. Matchmaking does not work. In this multiplayer live service game. Hasn't worked for 2 weeks now. Have fun playing alone because even if you do have friends to group with manually the endgame content is single player only where you take the incompetent bots and go at it alone. In this multiplayer game.

5. BUGS. This deserves its own subsection.
5.1 Game breaking bugs. These are constant and range from crashes, dropping through the earth, being launched into space randomly, new areas not loading, key enemies not spawning or falling through the earth, the list goes on. Expect several restarts of this game in a typical 2 hour gaming session. If you manage to get lucky and avoid these then you get to deal with...

5.2 Loot and reward bugs. For the past week the game has not properly been dropping key rewards, and items that are required to progress to the endgame loop cannot be acquired or upgraded. You cannot upgrade gear to higher power because the game was not rewarding upgrade modules correctly. You cannot upgrade your artifact because the game has bugged out and not provided new faction missions for a week. You cannot get better loot because the elite hive you just finished bugged out and rewarded you with a level 1 piece of gear. You cannot progress through your character's challenge card because half the challenges bug out and do not complete. But if you are happy to look past these bugs and play on then you get to deal with...

5.3 Combat bugs that remove the ability to play the game. Your character will freeze suddenly and be locked in place until you are killed. Your character will suddenly be hit by a ranged attack that had no danger indicator and be killed. Your character will be frozen in place by an attack that clearly did not hit you and be killed. Once again, the list goes on. Normally these are just groan inducing issues that make you facepalm while you are being revived, however the endgame missions in this game function in a way that if you get knocked out once you restart the whole thing. Not very fun when avoiding getting knocked out is entirely out of your hands. 

5.4 Cosmetic bugs. Skins being locked after being unlocked. Skins disappearing from the game entirely. Skins not being rendered correctly in game. Taunts and emotes bugging out and freezing your character in place. This includes cosmetics that players have spent real world currency on. 

6. Ridiculous monetization. Skins, emotes and takedowns are all ridiculously overpriced. This game is a full price game that has had mobile game level microtransactions pasted on top of it. Features that are in the base game are locked behind a pay wall in order to make more money. In addition, there have been reports of playerspurchasing credits (the in-game premium currency) and not being rewarded any. Yes, you heard that correctly. People are spending real world money and the server is bugging out and not giving them any. 

For clarification, this review is formulated based on 2 weeks and over 80 hours of gameplay. For those of you thinking 'well I am sure these issues will be swiftly addressed with a big patch', this review was written 2 days after said patch. Every single issue addressed above was present prior to this patch, listed in the patch notes as being addressed, and every single issue has remained after the patch as well as bringing some fancy new ones. It is also worth pointing out that the new patch did not add a single new feature or gameplay elements, as developer time is being entirely consumed with bug fixing and damage control.",1600574944,1600575741,False,2,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198051798572,46,1,7471,1370,5335,1602068291
38,76259578,english,"I'm a massive Marvel fan and the thought of being able to play as my favorite characters was extremely enticing. While I think the main campaign is a great story and quite fun to play through (though, a non-spoilery warning, you play more as Kamala than I would have preferred), the replayability is just completely shot for me. The system is set up great to make the game replayable or playable for a long time with multiplayer missions. They're fun to play, especially with a full squad. That is, if you ever get one. Matchmaking is totally busted. I will fire up this game, sit in matchmaking waiting for for a fire team for 10-15 minutes, only to get annoyed and quit before I find anyone. They added in a ""quick match"" feature which basically says you'll be the fill for some other fire team that has an open spot, and even when doing that I'm unable to connect with people. Occasionally it'll find 1 person, but then while waiting on others that person ends up leaving. 

Now I don't know if the game is to blame for that or if there just isn't a high enough population on PC, but it is due to this that I'm giving a thumbs down on the recommendation. I have 27 hours on record. Probably a cumulative 5 or so of that is just waiting for matchmaking. 

Again, if all you are interested in is the Campaign, then you're in luck: it's fun! If you want to get more out of it than that, then keep in mind the matchmaking is horrific and you'll have ridiculous wait times to find a team, if you ever truly do.",1600575476,1600575476,False,2,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198045467734,88,2,1634,0,1634,1600575079

53,76257069,english,"As much as I'd love to recommend this game, I just simply cannot. CD has proven to be incompetent even moreso with their latest ""fix"" for the game. If not for the more bugs than actual smoothly-running things in this game, it may be pretty solid. Remember a time when companies actually had beta tests that took care of most issues before release? That's where we're at now, after paying $60. 

The missions, while somewhat repetitive, are still relatively fun when they actually work. Things get stuck behind walls on occasion, but, if you're lucky a little bit of aoe will kill it instead of having to reload your checkpoint. 

If you're able to actually press ""Start"" without the game crashing now, the loot is nerfed, hooray.  While a lot are comparing it to Anthem, I won't, because Anthem actually works. 

I guess Crystal Dynamics is super confused by social distancing, and nobody mentioned to them that it does not apply to online gaming. They've done a pretty good job of keeping us fairly distant as their matchmaking does not work for co-op. I don't typically play with pugs myself, but, it's a neat little feature for those that do. 

With a little coaching from a company that knows what they're doing, this game may get fixed in 6 or so months, in time for you to pick this up on sale for $10, if it isn't F2p by then. Until then, you'll find more enjoyment out of opening a different game, and pressing ALT F4 every half hour or so.

78,76185633,english,"This game could have been really good, there's a good core idea here with how different each character feels, but it just never gets off the ground.

The story is so short and nothing actually happens, and the lack of villains in it is astounding. Couldn't they have just found a way for you to defeat a couple of villains from the comics along the way? I thought of people like the Wrecking Crew, the Serpent Society, Grim Reaper, Whiplash etc. Instead, you get Taskmaster in the TUTORIAL, Abomination an hour after that, and NOTHING ELSE but the final boss. That's almost 8-10 hours between 2 actual villain fights.

All the Avengers feel incredibly weak, dying in a total of 5-6 hits, stunned 60% of combat, even with perfect dodges, because if you dodge one attack, too bad, there's at least 5 more attacks coming your way.
If you're gonna add a dodge mechanic. maybe actually make it work in the game you're making.
Even though the combat is satisfying and fun on some characters (mainly Thor, Widow and Cap), the constant stunlocks and undodgeable moments after getting hit once really bring down the fun factor during gameplay sections.

I haven't really gotten into the grind part of the game, but what I've seen so far from the loot in the story, and the hero cards and all gives me a hugely bad impression. Hero card grind seems very long and tedious, and if you don't wanna grind the levels, it's a cool 50 bucks to fully upgrade the card PER CHARACTER, so good luck with that. I know they're all cosmetic but, in a game where the whole point of the endgame is to kit your characters with the best looking outfits and the best gear, of course the cosmetic purchases are important, and the time to grind and these real money prices are revolting.

Optimization is garbage, it crashes, drops tons of frames, stutter issues, my computer usually runs every game out there pretty well in High to Ultra settings, yet this game always seems to never fully hit 60 fps.

All in all, this could be a much better game, but I don't think even with updates to system won't work because the foundation itself seems weak and rotten.

The multiplayer missions are way too repetitive and the gear you acquire does not feel like it matters (except when it upgrades your stats, the perks feel useless). I could be wrong though as i only played for 11 hours and only got to level 40 gear.

The characters you play as feel too balanced, you can't one hit kill enemies as hulk some of the characters powers are restricted to one use every minute or so (cooldown time or time need to build by fighting i think) while I can understand that they wanted to balance it.

The Campaign(single-player) is decent if a bit rushed, and the combat as the Avengers is very fun, much like the Mechs were in Anthem. The problem is that a lot of people experience the exact same issues across the board as that game. There are constant disconnects for a lot of people, constant crashes to desktop, the game is buggy and can even corrupt your save files which are all client-side, so if they are ruined, you have to start over. The enemies are imbalanced, the loot is about as bad as it is in Anthem as well, the only way to actually farm Exotics is ONE single solo mission that is 14 floors full of fights. It takes over an hour to complete and if your game crashes, you just lost that run. So you can't even do the one endgame thing that you are supposed to do in a looter like this.

If/when they ever fix this game, it will be great. The potential is there, but so was the potential in Anthem. Bioware did nothing with the game and still hasn't fixed it. This game has only been out for a little over a week and claims to have a patch coming soon, presumably in the next couple weeks that will ""fix hundreds of quality of life issues."" If that is true, great. That is what everyone wants, but I will believe it when I see it and won't change my review until they have fixed the game. I want it to succeed, I dumped over $80 in it with no way to get that money back, but I will not pretend like the game is good right now and defend them releasing another Anthem.

Edit: Patch 1.3 is out now. The combat is a little more balanced from the enemy side and a little more fair. The main issue of ranged enemies being horribly oppressive have definitely been toned down which is a plus.

A lot of people are also noticing performance improvements, but it's worth noting that if you have older hardware like myself, i7-3770k/970GTX, you might suffer a performance downgrade now. If you have better hardware, you will likely notice an improvement since the patch.

Lastly, the loot is still bad. It seems like instead of making Exotics decent, Legendaries got a slight nerf to compensate for Exotics being mediocre. The only way to get an Exotic previously was a CHANCE on your first attempt at the weekly Heroic Hive, which was solo-only. Now they added a Weekly Mega Hive, but it's also solo. No multiplayer Exotic farming, and even after completing it for the week, you still aren't guaranteed to get an Exotic. This is probably a worse loot itemization and drop mechanic than Anthem even at this point. 

The raid coming within the next few weeks should change that and allow you to farm Exotics in Multiplayer FINALLY, but it's not here yet and will likely have it's problems as well.

3,76244049,english,"This game is fun at the same time frustrating to play. 
Here are some of my opinions about this game:

[b]What makes it fun to play:[/b]
[list]
[*]Awesome Hero Combat Mechanics -  9/10 
 - You can get creative with the combos of each hero, which makes it fun and awesome; also, the skills and attacks of the heroes  reminded me of marvel heroes.
[*]Great Character Design - 8/10
[*]Great Story Campaign - 7/10
[*]Awesome Graphics and Game Physics - 9/10
[*]You get to play your favorite avenger
[*]Its like watching The Avengers movie all over again
[*]You can earn currency (Units) that can be used to buy cosmetics just by playing and opening loot boxes
[/list]

What Makes it frustrating to play:
[list]
[*]Missiles, Lasers and Other Range Attacks Everywhere
-  Instead of enjoying the what a hero can do like doing your own combo and stuff, you can't utilize that because of the range attacks that attacks you out of nowhere. Also many range enemies would spawn in an instance
[*]Dodge indicator / Attack indicator just signals the user that an enemy would attack but would not mean that its the right time to dodge which is confusing.
[*]Dodge needs to be perfect (you'll still get hit if you dodge, after the indicator pops out, by a second early )
[*]Random crashes - still happens after the patch
[*]There are enemies that will suck out your hard earned charged skill ( before using any skill you need to build it up first)
[*]Enemies stun lock you
- Another reason why you can't enjoy the combos that a hero can do, enemies that are together would attack you consecutively which would kill you in seconds; can't even dodge this because it needs to be ""perfect"".
[*]Because of enemies stun locking you and group of range enemies spawning, I sometimes resort to doing cheap tactics like range attacking an enemy or dodge dodge dodge dodge dodge dodge dodge dodge dodge dodge dodge dodge dodge dodge dodge dodge dodge dodge dodge range  attack dodge dodge dodge run away range attack range attack - something like that
[*]No X-Men 
[/list]

Despite it having great features what really decided me to not recommend this game for now are the frustrating enemies that stun lock you, the dodge mechanic that needs to be perfect and also the random crashes that happens at crucial times (like boss fights).

11,76239791,english,"Marvel Avengers is definitely worth the purchase. It's a great romp with the Avengers that really makes you feel like you are a part of this team. A beat em up brawler to its core, it uses Combo based combat requiring a mixture of light and heavy attacks, button holds, timed dodges and parries; and three unique special abilities per hero. 

Graphics are superb, with multiple particle effects going off all over and bright bursts of colour in almost every encounter, it's a visual tour de force! The heroes look like their iconic comic book facsimiles and after playing a bit you get the sense that Thor looks and acts like Thor, Stark is his usual irascible self and Banner is an introspective ball of anxiety. One area of note that they got right was Kamala. Kamala was a study in great character development and her interaction with her father, and her growth through the Single Player campaign was extremely well done. I will remember the scene with her sitting with Bruce in the RV for quite some time, hilarious while at the same time providing a moment where the player understand their developing relationship perfectly in that simple everyday moment. The single player experience is worth the cost of entry.

The game makes you feel like part of the team throughout the entire single player campaign, with banter back and forth between the heroes that matches the personalities that were developed throughout the MCU movies. The single player campaign could have been its own movie, and it would have done well at the box office, it's better than some of the actual MCU releases. All we do is Win Win Win! 

Ironman feels like Ironman in combat, switching between his iconic repulsors, laser beams and rockets (my preferred weapon), and being one of two characters that can fly. And flying feels great, and is very easy to control. Even Black Widow who I had doubts about is actually a very strong character that gives you a FPS feel with her ranged attacks and her requirement to avoid getting hit for all her buffs to work. Thor is a god, and you will have so much electricity and massive hammer smashes going on that it is bound to bring a smile to your face when playing as the Odinson. Every character feels unique, but the systems are not so different that a player will have to relearn each hero. This will also make it easier for them to add new heroes to the game as the DLCs and Updates drop, and we can apparently expect several updates. 

Environments are ok, you can see where they were kept simple and are more there to provide the necessary platforms for hero travel and a playing field for the battle setpieces than any sensible architecture or realistic landscapes. Think of the game as a sport, you enjoy the gameplay so the missions are just different stadiums. The star isn't the pitch or the stadium, it's the heroes and the game itself. I would say a game like Destiny has a lot more invested in the environments and the feel of the zones than Marvel Avengers does. Warframe would be another example of the mission zones which all look very similar and are quite random. Warframe has updated after years to include three open world zones that look like real landscapes. Perhaps Marvel Avengers will do the same in the future. Right now, outside the Single Player campaign where you see these areas for the first time, they are nothing special.

Multiplayer is a blast, with each player controlling a different hero and taking on missions together. The game is Hub-Mission based, where players start in a central hub and then can pick from a list of missions to play. When you team up with your friends the matches become even more enjoyable, as you can combine forces, team up on big bosses and find all new ways to combine abilities and powers. You need to understand Status Effects, Finishers and Takedowns at the higher difficulty levels to survive. Ratcheting up difficulty when all you've been doing is button mashing heavy attack for the last twenty levels is going to leave you frustrated. 

The game is not easy. Your screen can be filled with a dozen attacks from different directions at any one point in time, and you really need to dodge, parry, and pick your moments to attack. Things can get frustrating with multiple homing missiles that never run out of fuel streaking after you while you try to dodge a massive attack from an Adaptoid. If you haven't learnt that you can destroy or parry those missiles out the air the game can overwhelm you. But it rewards the player who thinks and pauses to parry, or to dodge as necessary. There are times when you find yourself dodging constantly and that's when you know it's time to reposition and regroup. Hopefully this difficulty is tuned, it seems to have started being tweaked with patch 1.30.  

Your AI teammates are acceptable, and they use the powers that you  have chosen for them and scale up to whatever mission level you are playing at the moment. It is doable to play through the game to character level 50 and power level 150 with the AI team.  

Game stability can be an issue, which is already beeing addressed with patches, I've had crashes and random exits to desktop. With a modest Nvidia GeForce 1070 I get 70+ fps at 1080p on High Preset. I made sure to turn off that ridiculous Intel wave and particle feature.

The whole Battlepass outrage is completely unfounded and the game has one of the best microtransaction systems around. You can purchase cool costumes for your characters to wear if you want to from the store. Some of them are absolutely amazing, and I am sorely tempted. People who played Assassin's Creed Origin or Odyssey will be very familiar with this system. There are no loot boxes, you buy what you want directly. Each Hero has Battle ranks that they go through and as they gain ranks they earn Emotes, Takedowns, Nameplates, outfits etc. I gained ranks without even knowing what the hell I was doing, and suddenly found myself with costumes and takedowns I didn't even know I had won. IF you don't want to play for hours, you can pay to fast track through some ranks and get the rewards immediately, your choice. The rewards are all cosmetic. 

I can't recommend this game enough to anyone interested in the Marvel Universe, and super hero games in general. I am having a blast with marvel Avengers and I'm looking forward to patches and updates. The team seems dedicated to making this a classic over the long haul, and I am expecting movie tie-ins and DLC in the future to keep everything fresh for years to come. 8/10",1600542362,1600543144,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197970318690,242,4,4028,0,3351,1600732051

enemy units still get stuck in walls, I just crashed, FPS is way better, more recycled single player content.. this game is garbage. Ill logon again and try to do my daily stuff so if one day this dump of a game becomes good Ill have the gated mats I need to upgrade gear

I dont know how long Ill even do that

hire some QAs, you need them badly
I have plenty of screenshots if you idiots need to see them

DO NOT, I SAY AGAIN, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME

Went from 31k players down to 4500. Today is a good day because the patch to fix everything was released 9/18/20
We have a woooohooo 9k players left. I have to tough out the dailies then I am done for the day

daily task still locked

missing skill points

still crashing

units still stuck in walls

still cannot open doors to get loot unless you play the hero for that type door (what about the future when more char cannot open doors like CA?)

they still have done nothing about my 32,000 units just poof gone

the list goes on and on

oh and they actually created new bugs like enemy units spawning on spawn points when the mission loads. Just wait until you have 3 beams laser you and you die before you can react. 

So dumb

gear is bad, gear is gated behind single player only
cannot play as same char ( so if you and a friend like Thor one of you will need to change to someone you do not want to play. For me I like MM and Thor but dislike the reset. Why force me to play someone I don't want? This problem is carried over in LAS and new Mega Hive)

The current set of characters are fun to play, once you level them up the game really starts to open up. Unfortunately that's where the game falls short, despite being patched the game still suffers from an abundance of crashes and bugs. End game hives crash when you're about to complete them, enemies don't spawn to let you complete the floor, you still get one shot by enemies right after doing any time of animation that keeps you from dodging.
I couldn't begin to tell you how many times I've been killed after completing a takedown animation, how many times I've had to restart an end game hive because I want to complete it with my favorite character after being blindsided and killed with one ranged attack. Getting one shot at plevel 150 with some of the best gear in the game shouldn't be an issue, and when you get to the last few floors you're just hoping the game doesn't crash on you.
I'm playing with a 2080ti, i7 7700, and 32 gb of ram. I really shouldn't have an issue playing this game. I've gotten to the point of running the game on the lowest possible settings to attempt to complete the end game hive missions yet crashes still happen.

I defended this game, it's understandable that bugs would get through due to the work at home nature this game has been through during its last bit of development, but the game continues to be a broken mess even after a major update.

First things first, if you have friends to play with, love the avengers or don't mind the somewhat derivative gameplay then you stand to have a lot of fun with this game. However, if you're expecting high caliber gaming pushing the bounds or at the very least delivering something familiar with breathtaking graphics and polished to something scintillating then my friend you will be Hercules ""disappointed!""

Main issues as far as I see them:

*Similar heroes. While many have differentiating attributes there are far too many similarities between some, and even with level-ups and skill trees it never does feel like much more than a brawler.

*Cut and paste level design. While some levels in the campaign have assets and environments you've never seen, a lot of missions reuses the same environments, in different ways, but you will feel deja vu more than once before this adventure is over.

*Infuriating combat systems. Look, the game is at its best when you are just moving around with a hero you like smashing enemies and getting loot. The problem comes from enemies that have really irritating shields or strict parry/blocking mechanics that in the chaotic nature of the game never feels anything but forced and irritating. I think there could have been more interesting ways to add depth to combat rather than shoehorning in mechanics borrowed from other superhero games ^^

The game constantly fights itself with systems that either are tacked on (gear-grind) and mechanics (parry, shield etc.) that just slot nicely into the game. It's also not very polished which is really sad considering the budget and all; simplistic fair enough I know what I signed on for (I played the beta), but the amount of small bugs and graphical hiccups are far too many and far too common.
The game runs fine on a solid rig, it runs poorly on mine (time to upgrade soon).

If you find a hero or two that is to your liking (Widow, Hulk for me) this game can really be a blast, but don't expect this to be anything but some slightly rough but mindless fun.

If you are looking for a looter, this in not the game for you.  Outside of that it is still a poor attempt at an Avengers game, and I do not recommend, so posting this as a warning to those that may be bothered by the issues I list below.

* Loot is invisible.  You do not see the loot, and you do not see any physical/graphical effects from the loot.  It has buffs, but that is it.  This should not have loot, and definitely shouldn't be considered a looter.

* If playing with a controller, the controls are very floaty, so combat doesn't feel tight and punchy.

* The story seems to be interesting, but the main character is too annoying with the fan girl stuff.  I get it from a narrative standpoint, but it needed to be toned down about 50%.

* The UI is terrible.  It is a bad implementation of Destiny's UI.

* Button press to interact takes far too long.

* Overall the game just feels awkward.  Progression is awkward, every level is just a wave of shielded enemies, and a few hours in I was already frustrated and bored.  I just wanted to know what happens in the story, and there are plenty of YouTube videos to cover that.

With games like God of War, Destiny 2, Ghost of Tsushima, etc. to compete against, combat games just have to feel impactful and fun.  This really stands out in what is supposed to be a ""game as a service"" game.  It just doesn't feel good to play, so why would you want to come back and keep playing?

48,75554006,english,"Edit: So i've now reached 160+ hours in the game and we've had the first major patch where they promised us 1,000+ bug fixes and i'm updating my review to include everything to this point.

Story:
The games story is fun and will get you through the first 10-15 hours of gameplay depending on you. The combat is fun and exciting most of the time. 

Character Development:
The characters develop a lot from where they start and what you end up with is a fairly robust hero design that feels like the hero most of the time. Keep in mind, feeling like the hero and feeling like a hero are different things. 

Combat:
You will move and attack like the heroes you know and love but if you thought hulk would be leaping large distances and smashing through things while a hail of bullets bounce off of him, you would be mistaken. Single basic attacks from a normal weak enemy can stagger him and disrupt your attacks. You're charging up a powerful ground smash that includes a 2 full second charge/animation time? Single bullet or melee attack from a basic enemy can interrupt you at the last part of the charging animation or disrupt you during the damage animation. The same goes for other heroes. You polymorph into a big Ms. Marvel, one hit knocks you out of polymorph and drains your entire intrinsic (polymorph) bar preventing you from going back into it. It should also be noted that the variety of enemies and villains is extremely limited at the moment. You will see and fight the same 20 or so enemies throughout your entire game play and there are only 3 actual villains you fight with one of them being a single shot fight and you won't see/fight him again. 

Leveling:
The story will only get you to about level 25 leaving 25 levels remaining that you just grind through on introductory missions and other items. Currently the most efficient method of leveling, farming gear, and farming resources ties to a single mission which will get you about 2-3 levels per 10 minutes or so if you burn through it. It should also be noted that you cannot replay the story campaign on other characters the way you do on the first. Grinding is the only way to level up additional characters.

The Game:
So what is there to do in the game? Really you're just going to grind missions once you finish the story and farm loot/materials and purchase costumes/emotes. The combat will sometimes be engaging but there are some instances where you will get one shot by something you didn't know was coming which can be frustrating. You will be inundated with repeat cinematics, mini cinematics, loading screens, and non-stop dialogue that is both limited and irritating (you can mute the dialogue, but within the dialogue are warnings about things you need to do for certain missions). You will repeat the same objectives over and over with the same enemies. The objectives are as follows: Protect defecting scientists, destroy servers/generators/turbines, hack servers, kill elite team, clear room. You will spam takedowns because it's the safest way to play (and they have monetized it by letting you purchase new animations) which is stunning an enemy and then initiating a mini cinema where you essentially do a ""finisher"" on the enemy which restores health and typically heroic meter. 

Co-op
It's broken. It doesn't work well, the player base is diminishing rapidly and all saved content is local meaning it can be edited very easily. But probably the most irritating part of co-op is that the content in the game that is supposed to have the best loot (Mega Hive and Elite Heroic Hive) is SOLO PLAY ONLY. 

Mega Hive and Elite Heroic Hive
Since I mentioned them in co-op, i'll touch on them here. These are currently the content which supposedly drops the best loot in the game. Exotics are currently the best loot in the game, I'm 160+ hours into the game and only have 1 exotic item that isn't automatic from the story quest and it has worst stats/perks than rare quality items so it's not worth using. The Elite Heroic Hive is 14 floors of the same objectives I described above. The Mega Hive is 8 missions of 5 floors (6 floors for the first one) each mission of the same objectives I described above (41 floors in total). They are both solo play only and drop mostly rare quality items. 

The Summary
The game is fun to a point. I do think I got my monies worth from it and don't regret the purchase in general. But I bought the game because it was advertised as on-line and co-op. Even after they heard player feedback that the Elite Heroic Hive was dissatisfying and players didn't want solo content, the next content they released is the Mega Hive which is again, solo content. The loot grind is tedious because enemies scale to your power level so you get an item that makes you hit harder? Enemies get more health. You get an item that lets you take more damage? Enemies hit you harder. 

I can't recommend the game as advertised. But as a single player with some co-op and extremely limited progression, it's not a bad game.",1599412332,1600527776,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198066179358,101,7,10572,157,9846,1601159456

This game had potential but as it is with companies these days they seem to think they can just release unfinished bug ridden garbage and expect the base to stick around.

This was in development for 6 years? They hired talented seniors only two years ago. This is at maximum a 3-year result of a game. How could this be good?

Heroes and their skills are cool, really satisfying. Overall combat is garbage due to non-fun enemies and mechanics. Overall gameplay structure (as in, what you actually do and target to do in this game) is garbage, there's just a few rinse-and-repeat endgame missions. Loot is garbage because of their focus on time gating and live service approach.

Patch also came with a new Weekly mission which is the current endgame: Gauntlet run of 8 Hives called Mega Hive which is... a forced solo mission. In a game marketed as multiplayer. Incredible. At least it gives 50 polychrons I guess.

It's also extremely tedious and boring to go through as there's nothing new at all, it's just the same hive floors you've done before but you gotta do 40 of them now. You can also save scum it on the last hive gauntlet until you get an exotic.

Original Review:
At this point this game is no better than Anthem when it released. Don't buy this game unless you can get it for ten bucks.
You don't know how much I regret purchasing this game for full price.

I REALLY tried to make this game work. Seriously, look at how many hours I have.

I'm not even that big of a marvel fan, but an online action rpg sounded fun, and the combat looked pretty good. And the combat is nice, very satisfying in fact especially when hitting level 50.

But that's it. That's all there is to this game. The campaign was okay, Kamala felt a little bit too much of a self insert but besides that pretty nice superhero stuff.

The multiplayer part though? Absolute garbage.

Rarity on loot has no meaning or use, THOUSANDS of bugs await you if you try to play with other players, can go from funny T poses to soft locks that force you to reload the quest checkpoint whether it's you being sent into a void of nothingness or an enemy being stuck inside of a wall/underground.

The missions are repetitive and boring, the enemies are boring. There is no real strats when you fight, just zerg rushes and having a busted skill build to bash on hp sponges by having low CD skills.

There is no endgame, there is no rare loot that changes gameplay fundamentally, there is no incentive to grind because all rarity of gear bar green/blue gear will all be equally good. And because there is no endgame, there's no reason to get stronger. They're planning on releasing raids for this game but considering how an absolute glitchy mess this game is, I'm having serious doubts it'll work out.

The population of this game keeps on shrinking, and matchmaking doesn't even work. And when it does work then chances are that after a VERY LONG LOAD TIME (that only happens when playing online), people will crash. Did nobody playtest this game???

Surprisingly deep game systems. Plays like a true Next-Gen Ultimate Alliance. Great original story. Yes there are Micro transactions, but DLC is free. Yes Spidey is PS4 only, sorry Sony owns f-ing Spider-man, deal with it. Most items can also be purchased with in-game currency. You can not spend a dime and still earn great cosmetics. The multiplayer is great matchmaking is supported. I completed the main campaign only doing a handful of side missions in 15 hrs. But there's multiple levels of difficulty and endless mission content still waiting for me. Great job Square-Enix and Crystal Dynamics.

Updating to recommended - Played with no crashes. Only had one bug, enemy stuck in wall, but was still able to be attacked so it didn't break anything. I will update if I experience any issues, but as for now it seems 1.3 has at least resolved my crashing with an Nvidia card.

Prior 1.3 Update:
With constant crashes and bugs in it's current state I cannot recommend. It crashes either at loading screen or end of mission every 2-3 missions for me. Bugs cause constant reload checkpoints as enemies disappear, you get stuck, or something else game breaking.

Campaign was enjoyable for me, but it is not worth purchase until they fix a lot of their stuff - at best this is in late alpha state.

If they at least fix the consistent crashes (which between my 2 friends and I seem to be related to having nvidia, since the one of us with a Radeon has yet to crash, but the 2 of us with nvidia consistently crash) I will update to recommended because the game is fun at times.

Other notes: The characters are very weak until you level them up and get the gear for your play style. Once you learn the character and get them level, if you play them right there shouldn't be any issue for most content (other than some 1 hit deaths which I still get from time to time)

Melee combat is almost impossible. The amount of instadeaths as well as undodgeable attacks the AIM mobs get is freaking insane. Heat seeking plasma bolts that go through walls and other objects is crazy, oh and you can’t dodge these. There is a .00002 sec window to dodge aka impossible. Melee needs to spend 95% of the time dodging and Perring. One mistake your dead.
Combat in the game needs a HUGE overhaul already. This game has no long-term replay ability except for the new hero missions. 

Overall wait for it to go on sale and play the story and come back when new heroes are released. Other than that… TBD by DLC.

Even the most basic grunt can stun them with virtually any attack.  Also when ai is attacking they tend to become invincible.  Their attacks will stun you while yours will never stun or interrupt them as long as they are in the middle of virtually any attack.  Despite the feeling of the heroes being incredibly weak, the game is still fun enough to play except for the massive bugs and crashes that can make playing the game at all incredibly challenging at times.

No game should launch at a $60 price tag with this massive laundry list of bugs and crashes.  No improvement seems to have been made and every play session is riddled with missions failing due to bugs and just outright crashes.

Recent updates to the game have only made it a more bug ridden mess than ever.  Now you'll frequently have missions with objectives to ""defeat all enemies"" where the enemies will consistently fall under the world and get stuck there, making it impossible to finish the mission.  Reload checkpoint - same bug happens over and over until you get frustrated and just abandon the mission.  Absolutely terrible.

26,76199507,english,"Okay, this games getting too much flak. I own both the ps4 and pc copies and I have played roughly the same amount on both (Characters are similar levels, campaign done boom). Note: I own a ps4 slim NOT a pro so I will be comparing from my experience.

I bought the ps4 version to play with my roommate since he has a brick for a pc, and I have a decent one so I bought the pc version to play on my own.

The game itself I find is a lot of fun gameplay wise. You really do feel badass beating the crap out of enemies, and each avenger plays differently and have customizable abilities so you can build whoever you like to play the way you want.

The campaign is short, which is fine for me since the writing for Kamala (Ms. Marvel) is a little cringy at times and is hard to listen to, although it does have some pretty awesome moments. The game was definitely built for afterwards tho (The Avengers Initiative). The loot system seems to be getting a lot of hate, I have no problem with it personally except when I keep getting drops that don't have stats that let me build whoever I am playing the way I want (damage baby).

I do really like this game tho. The performance on my PC is great, it never dips below 60 fps (graphics setting high) and I don't have a high end pc at all so its good.

The game is definitely meant for next gen for consoles though. If you are wanting to buy this game to play by yourself, get the pc version (unless you have a ps4 pro) on the ps4, the game uses resolution scaling and goes down and makes the game look bad all the time, and the game is already super blurry. Plus the framerate suffers, going as low as 23 fps. Pro has no issues with this from what I have heard. If you have a decent pc and get it up to 60 fps, its wonderful. It makes dodging attacks much easier so you don't get hit constantly because the frames are low af (thanks ps4). 

I think most bugs have been fixed, I have only run into a couple non game-breaking ones. The game has only crashed on me once tho.

If you like a good repetitive game where you get to beat everything up, this is the game for you! it's a solid game for marvel fans and is a lot of fun! Especially with friends.

Honestly this game is a good bit of mindless fun, especially when you've got a full group of people going crazy in voice chat; cheering when that Hulk clap goes off is simply the greatest.

It really depends on your chipset, motherboard, which brand of video card, etc. However, the sheer amount of issues of which I have experienced, even after reducing video quality to it's lowest and resolution to 1440x900 still results in CPU optimization from 64-100% with high temperatures to match. I'd say wait a couple of months for these issues to be worked out before purchasing.

After patch 1.3 however, the CPU issue has been resolved, so now it actually runs without cooking my computer, and it's actually stable after an hour.

78,75747410,english,"The in game mechanics could have used a bit more work in my personal opinion. Plus for me I experienced a lot of bugs. For example, in the training tutorial, I had to counter as Kamala. But despite pressing the key to counter the enemy's attack there would be no response, and the character model would just stand still. But this bug wouldn't occur in a campaign mission. But since it was mandatory for me to counter the attack I could not pause and restart and had to force quit. So.....

Edit: After another agonising 57 hours of me trying to get my moneys worth. I still stand by the decision of not recommending this game. But will breakdown the pros and cons to give people a better view if they are considering to buy the game. 

Pros:
-Although there are tons of aspects that I loathe, there are a lot of things that I really enjoyed while playing. The first thing that I must compliment is the campaign. It is incredibly fun to play, the story was very well written and the level of difficulty in the campaign is just right. Not too hard, but not too easy. (I wish it were the same for the content afterwards) The campaign also came with a juicy post credit scene, so I hope they will be expanding on that. 
-The loot in the game is pretty good, there are mission (like elite mission eg. elite hive or vaults) that consistently drop legendary items. And I love the idea that if you fulfil the optional objectives (like not dying during certain task) you get better rewards like better stats and possibly exotic gears. 
-The gameplay of individual characters is decent. So I love playing as Captain America. He's such a fun character to play, he has a good balance of ranged attacks and melee attacks that looks amazing. The same goes to Thor. It feels so satisfying to pin someone down with Mjolnir. Black Widow with the invisibility skill. Which leads me to my next pro
-The skills that you can use with each character (called heroics in the game) is very well thought out. And by using skill points you can upgrade these heroics to match your play style and knowing how to upgrade your skills can lead to infinitely using Cap's ultimate heroic if you know what you are doing. Or continuously using Black Widows invisibility if you play her perfectly. 
-The graphics in my opinion looks very very good despite what other people say. Like the Stark tech outfits for the characters is just *chef's kiss*. 
-I love how it is so free to play friendly with regards to gears. Cuz they could've easily done chest openings for gears to force us to gamble for exotic gears and stuff. A lot of the cosmetics are very free to play friendly as well which is great. 

Cons:
-The imbalance in the level of difficulty between missions. For me some of the content after the campaign mode is way way way too difficult. Like Elite missions on NORMAL mode I am practically always getting 2 shotted unless I am using Khamala or the Hulk. Even Thor is way too fragile compared to comics. I mean the Hulk in this game isn't exactly tanky at all, meaning dont expect him to take continuous damage without getting guard broken and not die. Like sure I understand if the Hulk has guard break immunity that would be pretty busted. But like there are some attacks from regular enemies especially long ranged enemies that would guard break the Hulk and it is incredibly frustrating. But I think they can introduce some mechanics that gives some characters guard break immunity for a period of time. Some ideas could be a passive in Hulk's list of skills to upgrade can guard break immunity when his health is below 50% for 10 seconds. Or a perk on one of Captain America's gear like his Armour that when his ultimate skill is active, he has guard break immunity.
-This is just more on how unnecessarily difficult some missions are. Most missions are a walk in the park even at Challenge IV (brutal mode). But the important ones that gives loot at normal mode I spend 90% of my time evading enemies attacks because they deal so much damage and so frequent. So a lot of the time I am sitting very far back while my AI controlled companions distract them and I just try and deal damage with my ranged attacks. (which kinda defeats the point of playing as Cap) And if you see a projectile coming, running away would not help, because if you dont perform a perfect evasion or perfect parry. The projectile will perform a 180 degree turn even if you run away. Like I totally understand if this was in brutal mode where you constantly have to perform perfect dodges and parries while fighting without breaking your combo. But in normal mode I feel like they could tone it down a bit or perhaps have a larger window of parrying/dodging or something like a prompt to press (Ctrl). And then at hard and brutal mode that prompt will not appear and it is purely based on the players ability to evade incoming attacks. Because in my opinion normal mode are for casual players that want to experience the juicy combos that they can perform with characters while making regular mistakes without having to get downed every 2 mins. 
-I must say that it contains more bugs that the average game. I have seen other people complain about this. Although this a frustration to having to restart from the checkpoint, most of these bugs are a minor nuisance. I have experienced 1 or 2 crashes, but not consistent enough for it to be a major problem. 

Conclusion: I am at the level where I can't recommend someone getting this game, unless you're looking for an actual challenge during endgame or just speed running the campaign mission. For the casual players that are just looking for a bit of fun, I personally found it very frustrating especially if you want decent rewards you need a 100% clear (meaning you can't die during the majority of the missions).",1599746067,1600460631,False,0,1,0,0,True,False,False,76561198142791314,24,1,5114,0,4861,1600527344

Visually, it looks well done, however, the game-play leaves more to be desired, and is still riddled with bugs (my AI companions would freeze and not do anything, I have crashed at least 5 times just loading into or playing levels, and my camera froze while performing a take down, forcing me to return to the main menu).  The levels get extremely repetitive, with only 2-3 mission types.  Almost every level (in the campaign and the side missions) is just standing at A, B, and C capture points and let JARVIS just hack your way to completion.  You feel no real sense of accomplishment by the end of the campaign.  Even the final boss battle is simple and barely feels like I did anything. [spoiler]For example, MODOK brings in a Kree Sentry for the final boss battle, but you don't even fight the Sentry.[/spoiler]

93,76178337,english,"At the time of writing, I'd give this game a 3/5.

I didn't expect the game to be this fun, but it is. The campaign is compelling and challenging enough to keep you wanting to play and explore, and voice acting is excellent for the most part. I found Kamala cringey and irritating in the beginning (and I still do at times), but by the end of the campaign you'll see that she definitely earns her place in the story and among the heroes. In terms of gameplay and combat, her character is pretty versatile and fun to play as. 

As you unlock more heroes, you might find yourself picking the same hero(es) over and over again. I would urge you to keep an open mind, play as every hero and level them all up a fair bit to unlock their skill trees. You'll end up enjoying the game far more that way and you'll see that every single one of them has their pros and cons depending on the scenario. I didn't think I'd like playing as Black widow for example (mostly due to the lack of powers), but she's actually become one of my favourite characters! Overall, the heroes feel well-balanced once you start to make some progress on their skill trees. 

Some of the enemies can be ridiculous though and need to be re-worked imo (e.g. the teleporting enemies equipped with the target-locking rockets that often need to be dodged more than once. They're a pain to deal with in large numbers or around more difficult enemies).

I've yet to try playing with others online, but I can imagine the missions being even better on co-op.


Right now (Sept 2020), the only major problem is the performance (and it is major, hence the 3/5 rating). It clearly hasn't been optimised very well and we're still waiting for an update to address these problems. I wish companies were willing to take an extra month or two for testing and to iron out some of the bugs and performance issues before the release. It's disappointing because this IS a good game, but the issues people have been coming across definitely takes the enjoyment out of it (frequent crashing, low FPS on a mid-high end system). With my graphics card and CPU, I shouldn't need to be turning down the settings as much as I've had to, but some maps (e.g. Snowy Tundra) are just unplayable unless I turn down the settings. There are also maps where you fall through the walls/floors and get stuck (look out for the HARM room in particular).",1600446725,1600446816,True,1,0,0.519917130470275879,0,True,False,False,76561198086249099,184,14,6539,495,5291,1601168097

99,75851609,english,"Man I have never played such a crash happy game before in my life.  This might be a result of Nvidia not having updated drivers for the TI 1080 since August and I'll update this if the next batch of drivers help but damn I have tried dropping graphics to medium presets, tweaking settings like the v-sync, motion blur and all sorts of things and the damned thing still crashes. And the worst part is there is no mission save so if the game crashes I have to start the mission over, when I finally got the Hives to show up I had the damned thing crash right when I completed the Hive, just sat there with a black screen and someone panting with BGM playing fine and dandy.
Besides the crashing overall its not a bad game, once you figure outs the dodge and parry stuff and unlock some of the moves characters can do to increase heroic moves recharge rates its pretty fun.  I like how the game gives you three bot champs to help out if you want to play solo but I feel this game probably shines with multiplayer from friend's lists. Rolling into a mission with the squad, showing off your fav hero, pulling off the big hits and combos, probably feels real good.  
This game does make you put on the grind pants if you want to have multiple characters leveled up and geared out though.  The max item level is 140 with a Greater Artifact at level 10 but the max item level gear drops at is 130 and the purple, yellow and extremely rare red gear are the only pieces that can be upgraded to item lvl 140 and you have to do it 10 times.  Well I hardly spent any upgrade mats gearing out my first hero and I ran out of the mats to upgrade Yellow gear seven boosts in, thats one of four slots with yellow gear that need to be boosted to 140.  In addition to that the greater artifact needs mats only available from daily quests needs to be bumped up to level 10 but despite each character equipping the same artifacts each character needs to level their artifact separately, granted there aren't that many greater artifact in the game at the moment but if you want all the bonus's of that that artifact you need to it to be at least level 3 or 4 and thats still a lot of mats from daily missions.  In short you gotta put on the grind pants if you want all your heroes to be at least item level 130.
The only thing that's going to keep this game alive is a lot of FREE playable characters and then paid DLC stories like Borderlands 3, Squeenix isn't going to make as much money as they think with the aggressive skin monetization, especially with multiple player being optional, so if they want to keep getting money and retaining players they need more things players can do, more characters to gear up and above all else they need to make DLC worth paying for and not cosmetic or season pass bull shit.   
So while this game continues to crash I'll keep this at thumbs down, but even then if it looks like Squeenix isn't going to keep the content for this game flowing then I really feel as this game might be another Anthem and ultimately another let down.

EDIT:
The driver update for 1080 TI GPU's came down on the 9/17 so I tested out the game that day and the day after and on long haul missions like Vaults and Hives I didn't crash once, even with the graphics pumped up to optimum by the NVidia Experience.  I still get audio glitches now and then but ultimately the game is a lot more stable than with the previous drivers.

that game is a disgrace
the campaign is good, it got a good narrative and pretty cool moments but the fun starts to end the minute the players are introduced to the loot system
the loot system in that game is only here so they can give u an excuse for the grind and i do not want to begin about all the ""exclusive deals"" like chars locked in other platforms (Spider-Man for example)
That game is embarrassingly low on content and feels just like Anthem at lunch date

It has potential, as did Anthem; but for now its a thumbs down until the game reaches actual ""Gold"" status.

Gameplay, loot system, upgrades, pass system and fighting is just bad.
Gameplay ties in with the loot system and upgrades, you get placed into the mission, told to go to X place, but in the corner of your eye you see something shiny purple so you go that way just to get something that is basically useless. Upgrading feels like it's just there so they can try to extend your playtime, there is absolutely no cosmetic change on changing gear which is obviously so they can sell the obnoxiously overpriced skins in a full priced game. Oh but you can earn stuff from the pass, if you buy it of course, per character, on their timetable because you are limited in how much you can progress....
Then the fighting...  It's clanky, doesn't feel right, plus sometimes the enemies have waaaay too much hp and everything is trying to kill you. If you play alone then playing with a character that doesn't have self healing is just making the game near impossible for no apparent reason, plus it's just lackluster.

Not a huge fan of Kamala Khan. Not that I dislike her, as I like almost all Marvel heroes. But first of all, I am very disappointed that this character is the main character to what was supposed to be an Avengers game. Should have been advertised as a Ms. Marvel game, not the Avengers. & Honestly, she was not even included in the game's early advertising & once she was announced, I expected her to be more of an extra than anything. 

I don't like the story at all. Yes, I did buy the game for the campaign as I am not much of a multiplayer person. I expected the campaign to be more of a superhero-style, rather than a buggy platformer with a little combat action. 

Only 5 hours in & I think probably 3.5 hours of that has been nothing but running & jumping. Also, I haven't fought many enemies, but I think the ones I have fought are all the same. 

Not a fan of how the campaign literally holds your hand through everything. Highlights all the games ""secrets"" to make sure you don't miss anything.

Also, why couldn't this game be open-world? I expected this game to be on par with PS4's Spiderman. This game is a tremendous let down.  

& How does it make any sense to make an Avengers' game loot-based?

46,76146685,english,"Finished the story and here's what my opinions are so far:

Graphically a pretty game, models are very nice to look at

Each hero feels like a unique addition with a lot of variation with the skill trees

Still pretty buggy. Crashes, out of bounds, black loading screens. The usual.

The skins feel...kinda lazy. We know they have access to all the comics as the comics are in the game. Yet, really, we have about 3 unique skins and a bunch of recolors. I'd hate to say it but spider man did it right. All the different outfits bring back nostalgia from certain issues and there aren't many (if any) recolors.

While talking about spider man, locking an entire class to ps4 is honestly just petty. It's the equivalent of locking, say, crusader on diablo 3 to xbox only. I can understand skins or appearance altering items, but locking entire gameplay features in a raid style game to a console? Come on now.

The story was very short. Equivalent to maybe a 4-5 issue run in a comic story really. I understand it's a ""game as a service"" but still. It left me feeling like ""wait, that's it?"" There wasn't much character development or any twist at all really that you didn't see coming. I certainly hope we get some more meat in story content to come.

The game is a destiny clone to a good degree. Not that that's a bad thing. But even down to the HUD (why do the scrolling cursor thing? Ugh).

I don't quite understand the respawn mechanic sometimes. Sometimes, it's restricted. Sometimes it's not. And that's in the same battle sequence, mind you. Sometimes I'll get downed and can be revived. Others, I just immediately die and have to redo the sequence over again. A little consistency would be nice, just so I'm not always surprised when I immediately die rather than going down.

It looks like there might be a hidden timer or diminishing returns on rewards from missions, as after I ran 10 or so iconic missions (which say they guarantee an epic reward) my rewards downgraded to only being rares.

Overall, the game feels good-ish (it's quite hard to not take damage in some fights when you're playing a bullet hell in 360 degrees with only your 180 degree vision.) The unique playstyle of each hero shines out, you can certainly tell there was a lot of time invested in how each character plays and what their strengths are. The game just left me wanting more. I don't feel any need to grind mindlessly as the isn't really a hook other than a short grab after the end of the credits. It feels like there's an artificial grind created with not much choice in how you do it (not many missions available, best bet is running the same iconic mission over and over and over as it scales and guarantees an epic item each run to keep pushing your power level up.) Which, this makes sense, as it wants us to keep playing until the next set of missions are introduced. It just doesn't have too much of a hook to keep me in. The enemies and areas are very repetitive and the difficulty is just a simple scaling up of health and damage. Overall, the game feels kind of middle of the road to me due to some really nice characters and combat, but bland everything else.",1600390087,1600390087,False,2,0,0.513568699359893799,0,True,False,False,76561198065276998,956,1,3784,0,3503,1600575758

I wouldn't mind some bugs but it is obvious they pushed this game out before it was done. I doubt the developing team wanted to release this hot mess but here we are anyway.

Instead of focusing on fixing bugs and returning items, the team is nerfing drop rates and easy farming spots. Of course these need to be fixed, but honestly the audacity of them stopping players from exploiting gear drops, BEFORE making the game even playable is an is insane.

Now as for the content. Not a single extra feature was added since this game was teased, the 2 villains they demo'd are the 2 villain got. Another sign of a forced launch by money hunger publishers.

51,76145307,english,"Well, too bad Steam doesn’t have a, ""Meh"", option.
To sum it up, don’t buy this game right now, wait for the devs to fulfill theirs promises to fix the game and release more content. I really wanted to recommend this game, I'm a Marvel fan, waited years for a good game about the Avengers, but at the moment, sadly I'm still waiting for this game. I expected more from this game. If you want to read in more details, see below:


The game is fun, the characters are fun to play as (Thor is the best IMO), but, the main campaign is so hollow, Kamala Khan starts a kind of good and interesting character, she is a super fan of the avengers, so you can relate to her and all, but man, it’s get old and annoying really fast. The lines are not very well written, the history is predictable and very short.
The main campaign is basically 5 types of generic online missions, play one mission, and you played them all. The difference is the Cinematics between them, which some parts have abrupt cuts, one moment they are in Alaska, the next they are already in Utah, like, what?

But that isn't the bad part, apart from the problems above, you can enjoy the Story, it not very good, but it’s also not so bad, the main problem is the bugs, glitches, game crashing, Skins/Outfits getting locked again, progress on the Battle Pass getting lost. The PC port is terrible, it took me 2 to 3 days to finally get the game to work.
The endgame is terrible, there is only the daily quests to complete, some SHIELD quests, (Which is the same as every other quest). There are only 3 unique boss fights in the game, one of them is Taskmaster, of which, he does not copy your movements, skill, and Heroic attacks. Why bother with him then?
The devs promises to fix, to release more content, and this and that. So, if you looking to buy, wait to see if all those promises will be completed. This moment the PC version feels left behind and forgotten.

The microtransaction is not very welcome, they want to sell you Outfits and Iconic Costumes, and because of it, the gear you collect are only to change an arbitrary number on your Character Stats.
The skill tree is different for every character, which make them feel unique, but at the end they are not. It’s basically a Light Melee Attack, Heavy Attack, Ranged and Heroic. With exception from the ones that can fly. Half the skill tree is to change some numbers from behind the scene. They lost the opportunity to have Iron Man’s skill to change accordingly with the Armor he was wearing, if you’re using the one made for Space, you have an skill set, one for Combat, another set of skills. You want to wear a gauntlet from one armor on another? Go for it.
If they made that way, then every character was going to be unique.

This sums up the game for me, I’m hard on it, because I want it to be better than it is.

62,76139016,english,"I'm torn between recommending and not recommending this game. Marvel's Avengers is a good game with fun gameplay and great dialogue. It's a little offputting getting used to avengers faces that don't match RDJ, Chris Hemsworth, Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, etc. but it's something that is fairly easy to get past. It's strange how MA was developed without the appearance of the Avengers cast, but yet they did such an excellent job finding people and voices that reflect their personalities almost to a T. It's enjoyable and I admit the dialogue is well done which is a great part of the game.Things I'm not thrilled about is the fact that there are microtransactions in a game that runs as a full priced AAA title. The microtransactions can be used to purchase cosmetic upgrades such as appearances or nameplates, but what I've noticed is that playing without the intention to buy credits to purchase cosmetic upgrades has been a very slow grind. I fear that they have intentionally over-inflated the cost of the best cosmetic items to encourage players to spend money to earn them rather than playing the game for a fair amount of time and that sours my attitude towards a game with solid gameplay.The gameplay itself is good. The gearing system appears to be very fair and there is no need to buy any form of credits to upgrade your loot and loadout as you level up your character. Where MA suffers is the same as many games that take this MMO style approach. There is no real end game content of any form of sustance. There are no raids. There are no dungeons. Just a series of additional missions to complete and grind to level up and gear out your Avenger.I feel this game could have had a lot more potential realized if they had given us the ability to make our own Avenger and build them in specific directions. There could be far more endgame content for groups to play through. Right now Marvel Avengers is a fun experience for the campaign, but the endgame content seems to be just a pointless grind without substance.

71,76136055,english,"tl/dr I think your opinion of this game will largely be influenced by your opinion of live service/looter shooter games overall.  If you like games like warframe or destiny, you might like this game.  If you’re not really familiar with live service/looter shooter games, but are familiar with single player action games like Spiderman or God of War, then this game will probably seem underwhelming to you.  If you’re looking for an experience like spiderman ps4, wait until they add more content to this game or skip it all together.  If you’re looking to mindlessly smash waves of robots with superheroes, then this game won’t be disappointing.  As far as technical issues, there are some issues with FPS drops and a handful of bugs but I’ve personally had zero crashes.  I had a few moments where characters would briefly glitch in weird ways during missions and I’ve had a couple moments where I had to restart the mission from a checkpoint because the objective didn't load correctly but nothing beyond that.  The campaign is good relative to other live service/looter shooter games in terms of quality and length.Technical issues aside, a lot of the issues people have with this game seem like issues with live service games in general; they typically launch incomplete (with the controversial stance that they'll get better over time), they lack in story content (if these types of games have a ""campaign"" at all, it's usually complete within 10-20 hours), and after completing the campaign, you're forced into a cycle of playing the same missions over and over again.  The live service model pretty much only serves to take what could've been brief but decent single player experiences and bloat them into something that sort've resembles an MMORPG but with 1/100th of the content you'd expect from an MMO, at the same or higher cost.  In this case, the live service model has taken what could've been a fine 15-20 hour single player action campaign and tries to bloat it into an experience that can be replayed for hundreds to thousands of hours.  There isn't enough unique content in a game like this to sustain hundreds of hours of playtime and progression.  There's roughly 20-25 hours of unique ""story"" content between the campaign and the ""iconic mission chains"" for each hero so as soon as you've played through that, you've experienced pretty much all of the enemies, bosses, characters, locations, and meaningful character progression.  Yet since this is a live service game, you're expected to keep playing, which amounts to you repeating that 20-25 hours of gameplay until you've had your fill and/or they add new gameplay.  This is true of pretty much every live service/looter shooter game I've played (anthem, destiny 1, destiny 2, the division 1, the division 2, warframe).  All of those games more or less follow this design path/philosophy (with warframe being an outlier in some cases but still is very repetitive).I feel like a lot of people take issue with how live service games have been handled, and I pretty much agree with all of those criticisms.  Developers have yet to really nail this formula.I feel like this standard for live service games was set by Destiny 1.  Destiny 1 in a lot of ways shaped the formula that large live service games have followed ever since.  They showed that you could launch a very incomplete game, with almost no campaign to speak of, with only about 10-15 hours of unique content before you started repeating it, and still succeed.  They seemingly established this BS idea that “it’s not about how you launch”, something people like Todd Howard really seem to cling to.Again, technical issues aside, a lot of the negative reviews I see about Avengers are more indictments of the live service model than the Avengers game itself.  If you’re already accustomed to this model from games like Destiny or Warframe, then I think you’ll find that the avengers does a fine job with this model.  The avengers has a better campaign than both Destiny games.  The cutscenes are well done, a handful of the levels are well done and cinematic (usually only the single player ones).  2-3 of these levels are comparable to the Spiderman ps4 game in terms of their cinematic qualities.  This game definitely is a step behind Spiderman in its storytelling, direction, and world building but it’s more of a lateral move in terms of its combat and even graphics in some cases.  The game does tell a story though it is a little too brief and rushed.  The characters are fine but aren’t given enough time to develop meaningfully, especially the villains.On one hand, the fact that this live service/looter shooter has anything in it at all that approaches the Spiderman ps4 game’s quality is impressive but only relative to other live service/looter shooters.  On the other hand, it’s still a live service game that expects you to play a 20 hour game for hundreds of hours.Having said all of that, even though I feel like the live service status quo is definitely lacking, the mindless and repetitive gameplay loops can be satisfying in their own way.  I haven’t played 100’s of hours of warframe because the story is well done or because of character development, but rather because the mindlessness of killing hundreds upon hundreds of enemies while collecting loot and min/maxing my characters can be its own type of fun.  The avengers has the same problem all of these other games had at launch; the loot/gear isn’t satisfying (it just raises your power level, it doesn’t do much towards allowing for unique or more customized character builds), the missions/activities aren’t numerous enough to minimize repetition, and the end game is barely fleshed out.  However, the avengers isn’t a lost cause like Anthem.  Rather, the core gameplay is solid enough, it just needs to be expanded upon, like all of those other games were.  Playing as each of the avengers is a unique enough experience and each is satisfying in their own way.  Often the combat is chaotic, as are most games of this variety, but occasionally it does come together to form some cool moments.  Generally, combo’ing your way through hordes of robots feels good, if you don’t mind the repetitive nature of it all.This game doesn’t need to be almost entirely re-done, like Anthem.  Rather, it just needs to be expanded upon.  Give us more heroes, more story and side missions, more varieties of enemies, more bosses, and it’ll easily be one of the better live service games out there.",1600371705,1600371705,True,4,1,0.552605688571929932,0,True,False,False,76561198003892699,251,3,1377,0,1264,1600818781

This is coming from someone who is more than patient with bug fixes, and balance issues. I've had enough. This is a great game,actually... AN AMAZING GAME !!! But you're ruining it for us Marvel Fans out here. FIX THESE PROBLEMS. IRON MAN - HIS FLIGHT IS VERY CLUNKY. He needs a  fine tuning. Seriously.... LOADOUT, FLIGHT, MECHANICS .... Revisit him.You need to fix the target lock. WE need to see who we're targeting etc....WIDOW - She's perfect, a few glitches here and there when she jumping walls, but other than that. GREAT JOB. THOR - His flight is also very clunky. The moment you engage in battle, and you accidentally his ""SPACE"" you're gearing into flight. It needs to be looked at more in depth. Its annoying. KHAN - She's perfect, She's about the only character you got right. HULK - HE NEEDS TO MOVE A LITTLE FASTER. He's not a slow moving piece of GAMMA. He's a muscle, strong-willed hero. Who needs to move with ease, and much quicker for the adept players. Hell, make it a skill tree if you want. BUT MAKE HIM MOVE FASTER!  CAPTIAN - The only thing that needs adjusting is his shield throw. The moment he's aiming targets for shield throw, and he's hit... it cancels, and it's starts all over again. ANNOYING !!!!! Like seriously. He's captian freaking AMERICA, the man can with stand a blast or two. Adjust it. Then his shield blast, (where you have to hit ""Q"" and then ""HOLD F"") needs to be adjusted. You should hit be able to hit ""Q and F"" right away to activate that. HALF THE TIME THE MOVE NEVER COMES OUT, unless you PARRY. Please fix. He's an amazing character, and I'm sure he's able to have some Grit to him too. Now for the Characters ultimates. We NEED more than 1 ulitmate. Give us at least 3. Something holding Shift+3 or/and Alt+3. Let's not make it stale with just more than 1 ultimate. I like that you have several take downs. Good job on that. Let's see what else......MATCHMAKING/QUICK MATCH - OMG PLEASE FIX IT OR GET RID OF IT. It's so annoying to sit in the Jet, and waiting to queue into a match, (you see mission objectives for the mission) and GO NOWHERE AT ALL!! Then the game crashes. WHY? PUSH TO TALK !!!!!! IT DOESN'T WORK !!!!! PLEASE FIX THAT TOO.IF you're loading the game, and you don't have your headset pre-set before the game loads, your in-game music is loaded to your default audio option. Then when you go to your window loadout to default to HEADSET. The in-game music doesn't swap. ANNOYING!!!! HARM ROOM CHALLENGES - They are very buggy. I took a video of an AIM agent getting stuck in the map (Wave 8/10 on LEVEL IV). My squad and I had to restart from Wave 1 because of this bug issue. PLEASE FIX THESE ISSUES, it's so annoying.  I think you guys came out a little early. Look at cyberpunk 2077. They pushed their release date back, because they knew it wasn't quite ready. But I'm willing to overlook these issues, if you guys give us a better game without the BUGS. HERE are some fresh ideas to help make this game a 10/10. 1. Ultron - We need a whole storyline on him 2. Thanos - WE got to fight him.3. We need to go back into the past, and visit some story origins of other characters being introduced to the game. 4. Reference to the movies, We want to travel to different galaxies, countries, and destinations fighting bad guys. 5. HYDRA !!!!! I WANT TO FIGHT AND TAKE DOWN HYDRA 6. Compromised Shield Agents, I would love to fight against US. 7. Give us Divide. WE want to LIVE THE CAPTIAN AMERICA CIVIL WAR fight scene, and reunite the AVENGERS AGAIN! 8. Keep us on our toes, GO AND TALK TO THE RUSSO BROTHERS!!! ASK THEM FOR HELP!!!!! PLEASE FIX THESE ISSUES AGAIN, and I will be looking forward to what your team brings to the table.

At the moment there are a ton of bugs, which I normally don't care too much about because I know they will be patched out eventually...but along with that it is also very unstable and very poorly optimized, part of that comes with the fact that NVIDIA (and I believe AMD users are in the same boat) currently do not have game ready drivers available, but the biggest part is due to programming. Users across all platforms are experiencing a game breaking amount of crashes, and unfortunately PC users are experiencing the most. The game is also very taxing, it does require a very high end rig to run on high settings and SLI/Crossfire is not currently supported. Those with lower end or older rigs will absolutely struggle to even run on low settings. In fact, the ""recommended specs"" for this game should be the absolute minimum you should be running with due to the poor optimization. However if you have a fast internet connection, you could easily run it through GeForce Now or similar apps on higher settings.Besides bugs and crashes, there is also currently a lack of end game content.

Let me start by saying there are two parts to this game: the single player campaign and the co-op campaign.They are both equally stunning visually and give the player a sense of joy when playing these characters because they feel fully fleshed out; each one his/her own unique story arch along with individual skilltrees that allow you to customize to your particular play style.That said let's get into the hard hits.The single player is beautifully crafted from start to finish and allows you to play as each character through a 8-12 hour long campaign. It is rather short, but enjoyable (I've heard that same about my love life)... however, one would hope this fun journey progresses even moreso via the online co-op campaign. *SPOILER ALERT* It does not. The co-op campaign becomes a tangled mess of random disconnects, glitches, and chaos of the not-so-fun variety (honestly, this game has more viruses than an STD clinic). But it doesn't end there, with no drop-in game feature it means when you are with a group of friends and on the last level of a 6 floor elite hive (or better yet on the 13th floor by yourself) and you get disconnected randomly it means you literally have to start all over again. But it's okay you have a variety of cosmetic skins that you've unlocked, via blueprints received in game or by in-game currency or if you'd like $14 premium skins, so you can look at your new duds while playing it the second time around. Oh wait, it looks like some of those skins you've unlocked somehow got re-locked. Well, lets continue to play the game and grind gear for when the new patch comes out sometime soon. Wait, hotfix, the loot has been changed... starting to see a pattern???Please understand this game has the potential to be everything Marvel fans have hoped and dreamed for, in many ways this feels like a cross between Marvel Ultimate Alliance and Destiny. But the fact of the matter is this game is currently unplayable. I've put many hours into the Beta, even more into the actual game, got my main character to 150, all subsequent characters to 130, and played and completed all storylines... but anytime I log onto play it's not a matter of IF I will run into a new bug today, it's just a matter OF when.As of now, as painful as it is to say it, I'd highly recommend just keeping this one game on your wishlist (if that).--3/10 - just because the solo campaign is solid--P.S. stay tuned for the review after the new update (fingers crossed)",1600318688,1600354548,False,3,0,0.5,1,True,False,False,76561198004482062,543,1,17061,2568,12903,1601734685

As far as the gameplay, we all enjoy this game like to run missions and help each other out to gear up. The later hives are   pretty much dungeon type floor crawls (think like heaven on high from FFXIV but not as many). The single player story is really good as well, I usually don't get caught up in the story but this one I did and i won't give spoilers. The only real gripe I have is that I wish they would fix the matchmaker to have more flexibility in letting people join in progress to help combat issues like disconnects mid run so people don't need to start over. The other thing with matchmaker taking so long is because no-one really wants to ""quick match"" and what i mean is they want to do their own missions (dailies etc) instead of using that option and as they release more missions it will become worse with wait times with this current setup.All in all, it's a good game with some issues that need to be fixed but being an online game, the updates will come so don't worry.

Most of the skills are fun and tend to change up your combat style so the button mashing does not get old too quick.My main issue with Avengers has to do with the loot and the cosmetics. For some reason the devs made the actual stat based loot you get invisible. Meaning, if I pick up a new legendary chest piece it will not change the way my character appears at all. The only way you change your appearance is through costume cosmetics-which have no effect on your stats. This seems to be a very deliberate decision on the part of the devs to push the cosmetic micro-transactions. Why wouldn't the devs simply add a ""cosmetic"" slot like most other games in this genre do? Maybe this should not bother me as much as it does-perhaps it's just me.Regardless, the game is fun and the issue I stated does not warrant a bad rating-therefore I do recommend this game to fans of brawler type games and loot based games.",1600331092,1600331092,True,1,0,0.522362291812896729,0,True,False,False,76561198054969638,348,30,1672,849,479,1601717323

3,76060418,english,"Well.... it was a good try. The bones of a solid game are here, but they tripped badly on the execution. The Good: The story is pretty compelling. The visuals are good, despite the uncanny valley sense that the characters are *almost* reproductions of the MCU actors. The dialog is, mercifully, well written - as compared to the excruciating schlock to which we have grown accustomed over the years. The Bad: First, the game performs poorly. If I was plagued by low framerates or stuttering, I would conclude my system was not able to handle the quality settings and lower them. What I get instead is random pauses in the middle of cut scenes or gameplay while the game tries to sort itself out. Also, not for nothing, but sitting on the studio banner for 60 seconds every time I start up the game is weapons grade BS. In a game that is plagued by load times, making me wait intentionally just to get started is bad look. Worse than the performance is the game play itself. ""Almost good"" is bad. There was an opportunity here to make combat feel like Arkham Asylum - chaining combos and super powers between robots in a very satisfying way. Instead the game constantly interrupts the flow forcing you to try to mix in dodge mechanics... which often do not work. When I'm playing as the Incredible Hulk, I do not want to dodge. I want to smash. Bobbing and weaving is fine for Hawkeye, Black Widow or Spiderman, not Thor, Hulk or Iron Man. Flying as Iron Man should be exhilarating. Instead it's frustratingly difficult to control.  One early sequence has you flying through a canyon trying to reach the goal in a time limit. Forget shooting things, it was all I could do to figure out what direction to go in and keep going in a straight line. Kamala's gameplay as low-budget Spiderman was 'ok', but it was boring. Her powers are uninteresting.Ultimately, I gave up during a relatively easy Iron Man mission. I found myself doing exactly the opposite of what I wanted to be doing: hiding behind a truck and taking Repulsor pot shots because running in to mix it up was a failed enterprise. The dodge would not respond properly, so the three robots with shields would just flatten me. This culminated with a ""territory control"" objective. ""Defend the circle"" while JARVIS hacks the mainframe. Robots come at you from all sides, some of them standing at a distance shooting you. As soon as you move out of the circle, you lose the control point and eventually the mission. It's an unnecessarily frustrating mechanic. After doing it 5 or 6 times, I decided that this wasn't fun, it was a chore. I was slogging through it hoping the game play improved or that the rest of the story made it worth it.

21,76051206,english,"Okay, let's get the bad out of the way first.[list] [*]Clearly this game was not properly optimized to work with NVidia graphics cards, nor was it optimized for memory usage. Are there workarounds? Yes, yes there are - but they can be fickle and really only extend the period before you get a crash, and even then it's really a random crapshoot for when they will occur. [*]Is the endgame grindy and repetitive? Yes, yes it is - but I will address the the naysayers for that one a bit down the line. [*]Does it seem like it was pushed out a bit too early for it's current price tag? Well, that's subjective - I feel like I got my $60 for what I've played so far, but that mileage will vary from person to person.[*]Is it a buggy, unplayable mess? If you don't institute some of the workarounds or have the ""wrong"" hardware - it can be, but from an objective standpoint I'd have to say no. It does need some polish and tuneup as it stands, that much can be said.[*]NOW, having gotten the gripes out of the way, on to the good stuff about the game and addressing some of the more minor subjective gripes.What was the last ""Superhero Game"" that you played where you actually felt like you were playing that particular character? For most of us that would have probably been the Batman Arkham games. At least that is what the reports and history would have us believe from reporting at the time. [*]Well, this one succeeds on that point. [*]When you play as a particular hero, while they may feel weak at first and underdeveloped - at least for once they give an in-game story based reason for why. For example: Iron Man (Yes, I'm an IM main). There's a reason Tony isn't using the ultra MK. WTFE when you get him, no spoilers but - he's lost everything, suits included. So now he has to rebuild from scratch. Hulk has gone feral, Thor has put down the hammer, Black Widow is MIA and off res, Cap is also MIA and Kamala - well she's still figuring out what she can and can't do with her powers. The game does a pretty damn good job of making you feel like these characters who are forced by story elements to lose a step (or 20) are reclaiming their own as you go so that by the end of their ""growth"" in-game you feel like you are playing as whichever Avenger you want to play as.",1600227305,1600227797,True,0,0,0,3,True,False,False,76561198027643120,705,2,23102,6268,10249,1602081816

26,76049297,english,"[b]tl;dr - Wait for sale if you want to play the campaign by yourself. The game design is player hostile in multiple ways and game itself has a lot of annoying bugs a couple weeks after launch.[/b]As a comic fan, I most enjoyed the solo campaign. The story is a well written take on an alternate Marvel universe. Kamala Khan is the standout character that does a great job of capturing her essence from the comics, minus a few nitpicks.Unfortunately, [b]the solo campaign isn't long enough to justify the full $60 price, and both the unlockables and multiplayer content are not player friendly;[/b] more on that in a bit. Beyond that the game itself is buggy. You'll likely encounter a lot of random performance issues, even on a top end gaming PC. A lot of the issues aren't unique to the PC version either; I've watched streams of the PS4 version that also encountered random slowdowns and glitches that required a reload or full game restart to resolve. There's also something wrong with the final campaign mission in that it's the only one where I've run into repeated crash-to-desktop glitches.So the main campaign is fairly short, which hurts the game in multiple ways. Not only would you prefer the game to be longer for the entertainment value, but if you're only into the game for the story you can probably beat it with most of the characters around level 10 (and the max level is 50). This is a huge problem because you unlock abilities from their skill tree based on leveling up, so [b]if you never grind the multiplayer missions you'll miss out on getting to play around with their best abilities.[/b]If you decide to dive into grinding out the multiplayer missions, get ready for a grind. The gameplay is very repetitive, and there isn't much in the way of enemy or level variety. You'll see the same building layouts over and over, just with slightly different objectives that don't make much difference. A lot of enemies are straight fodder, while other enemy types are just annoying damage sponges that can kill you if you don't dodge their unblockable attacks. Then there are automated turrets that are easy enough to kill, but your AI teammates don't prioritize them properly and if left alone they will quickly destroy your entire team.Regarding unlocks, each character gets 2-3 costumes unlocked through the campaign. Beyond that, they all have like 20 other costumes that require spending a ton of real money, or a ridiculous amount of grinding; to the point that you could play the game all year and still not unlock them all. Part of the reason for that is that grinding unlock is gated. Each character has their own process bar for unlocks, and you only get progress from completing daily and weekly objectives. The objectives are stuff like, ""Kill 20 enemies with your ____ power"". And [b]the game doesn't care if you have that power unlocked in your skill tree or not.[/b] On my second day of play one of my objectives was to strike enemies with a power from the bottom of one of the skill trees I had zero points invested into. And then when I completed one of my weekly objectives, it didn't reset and give me a new one when the timer hit zero (glitchy game).Overall I still enjoyed the main story and most of the time spent playing it. So I debated a while whether it deserved a recommendation or not. In the end I decided I can't recommend it due to core design decisions that are player hostile. Beyond the forced grinding I already touch one, one example is that [b]there are doors that only certain characters can break through.[/b] These are never essential to complete the stage, but they always contain loot chests with gear you want to make your character stronger. If you're playing in multiplayer someone else can break the door for you, but [b]if you're playing solo there's no way to get through them. And to rub it in your face, there's a Captain America specific stage with a door that he can't break.[/b] I encountered this type of issue multiple times throughout the game.There are also annoyances like daily faction quest givers being in two different maps, so if you want to get the quests each day you have to go through multiple maps and loading screens just to reach them.[b]Between the short campaign, game glitches/bugs, repetitive gameplay, game design elements that just feel bad, and the unfeasible grind for unlocks, I just can't recommend this game at full price.[/b] If you're a big fan of Marvel/Avengers, I think the main story is worth experiencing, but $60 is too much to ask.

54,76039397,english,"The game isn't without its faults, but in a world filled with high profile looters, Marvel's Avengers stands apart from the rest. I couldn't get in to the art style of Borderlands, and Destiny had a way of keeping me at arms length by being a little too much, and rooted in online play. Avengers finds a middle ground here, by being decent enough to look at, while being approachable for a casual player. 

The main campaign takes about 14 hours if you are going straight through, but if you are like me, you are going to want to level up your characters, and take on the random side missions and challenges. I'm currently a day in to playing, (Just under 24 hours) and I'm enjoying it. That's just playing through the campaign, and getting to know the characters. 

All of the characters play differently, and can further be tailored to suit how you want them to play. From animation, to movesets, to movement type, they all play different enough that everybody should find a character they enjoy playing as. Want to fly around? Take Thor for a spin. Like flying but don't like how you have to make mjolnir return (Which imo is a cool addition, as it can add damage as well), choose to play Thor as a melee character, by upgrading those trees. 

The game got some flack early on for not using the MCU characters or their actors, and some thought that it made the game hollow. Personally, I enjoy this take. It sets itself aside from the rest pretty early on, and allows its versions of the characters to differentiate themselves from their Marvel Studios counterparts. 

The story is pretty cool, though if you watched any of the promotional materials leading up to launch,  the final twist is given away (Yes I know, fans already know... but fans arent the only people that will play the game). And the voice acting is pretty fun to listen to. All of the characters have some truly fantastic moments, and the writers did a good job at setting up character dynamic. The Avengers team feels super fluid, and everybody has there own role to play, while having different relationships with each other. The relationship between Banner and Khan, is specifically fantastic. 

This doesn't feel like a looter I've played before. There is a lot of variety in gameplay, and I never feel like I am bored, or bogged down with too much unimportant lore that you have to seek out yourself if you want to have an actual story (Something some other looters are guilty of). 

If I have to take points away for anything, its in reusing areas. Its usually just buildings or assets from other areas, but it is still noticeable. 

Overall though, this game is a pretty fun ride. Add on to that, that the team is going to be releasing new characters, for free, each with their own individual campaign missions (Though I don't know how much these will add on to the game. I have a suspicion they will end up being akin to the iconic mission chains that each character in the game, already has). These characters will have their own battle pass, which will come at a fee, though they only unlock in game stuff. They are fully playable without this, and you can earn enough credits with the free characters to unlock a premium battlepass for new characters. 

Crystal Dynamics has given us a pretty fun looter, without any of the greed that others have had in the past. Its not without its faults, but if you like this type of game, and enjoy the IP? This is probably for you. I'm not even that big of a Marvel fan, and I think this is an enjoying game worth playing.",1600205871,1600205871,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561199041023764,87,1,1792,145,1406,1601230753

60,76037213,english,"TLDR: It's just not fun to grind after beating an unremarkable story. If you HAVE to have it, wait for a half off sale at least.

I really wanted to love this game, but it's just not worth it in my opinion. Coming from someone who has 3060 hours in Marvel Heroes, I can confidently say it's definitely not a replacement if that's what you're looking for. First off, the game's style is strange. It's obviously done with inspiration from the MCU, but it has nothing to do with the MCU, which is going to put a lot of people off immediately. I don't really mind this, but I can see it turning people off. The campaign is mega short, and they point blank lie to you about how long it is when you look at the mission selection screen. The total ""campaign progress"" percentage also counts side missions... So needless to say, I was surprised when I beat the game with something like ""50% campaign completion"". Every mission and objective is very samey. Go here, beat up these guys, stand in this circle, break this. Rinse and repeat. This wouldn't be an issue if combat wasn't extremely clunky. There are dodge, block, and counter mechanics for characters to utilize, but most of the time, the timing is just absolutely wrong, so you take all manner of unnecessary damage despite timing your dodges and counters frame perfect. Speaking of unnecessary damage, the ranged enemies... Pretty much every encounter has turrets shooting at you from various angles, as well as ranged combatants, and whether they're firing lasers or projectiles, something will hit you, and taking ANY damage renders some characters' intrinsic abilities worthless. Good luck trying to hold Black Widow's buff for any length of time. It even gets reset if an attack hits you while you're invulnerable during a takedown animation! Why is that a thing!? Difficulty feels artificial because of the wonky mechanics, and power level. If you've ever played Destiny or any RPG, you know that trying to fight enemies significantly higher level than you are just going to dook on you because stats. I find a combination of the power level and clunky mechanics so frustrating because the fighting animations are so good that they are soooo close to having a really fun high skilled combat system that rewards good timing and character mastery, but I just don't see it. The story is unremarkable starring Kamala Khan, a character no one asked for. She just fills that annoying teenager archetype that can easily get on your nerves. She's supposed to be you as a fan joining the Avengers or some ish, but I just didn't care for it. If they wanted to feature some cool inhumans, I would've vastly preferred Black Bolt, or ANYONE ELSE from the royal family. The maps are greatly lacking only offering some woods, generic New York streets, and a kind of desert area. Then you work your way indoors from all of those maps to pretty identical AIM facilities. How are you gonna have Thor in the roster and not have his Iconic mission chain take you to Asgard?? Oh, the Iconic mission ""Chains"" lol! What do you expect when you hear mission chain? Maybe 5ish+ pretty cool missions to give you insight into each character? How about 2 missions, and some ""trigger this abilitiy 5 times"" type objectives. The loot system is kind of like Anthem in that it's boring. Nothing drops that gets you pumped to keep playing looking for more sweet loot. It's all just stats here and there with a couple of effects like ""freeze enemy light combos"". Nothing that really changes up the way you play aside from stacking might for melee focused attacks, or precision for ranged. STILL BUGGY. I'm still running into some bugs that just shouldn't be in the game. For example, I still can't get Thor's Iconic outfit, even though I completed his iconic quest chain, yet I have Captain America's Iconic outfit, without completing his... Speaking of outfits, each character only has about 6 outfits (plus whatever rotates on the paid store), which have 3 or 4 palatte swaps each. Some of the designs are really cool, but there's just not enough, and I think that's the main issue of this game. Bugs, clunky combat, lack luster story aside; this game just doesn't have enough content to be a grindy game. They expect you to get at least 2 years of enjoyment out of 20 hours worth of content.

In conclusion, I could go on and on about things that got on my nerves, but I'm tired of typing. This was just one of those games where the more I play it, the less I like it. Issues just kept piling up until I just decided ""wow, I really don't like this"" which is a shame because I was eagerly looking forward to this since I first saw it  a few years ago. I'll pop on every now and then to see if my opinion changes, but as of right now, if you're on the fence, I'd pass on this one. If you absolutely have to have it, I suggest waiting for at least a half off sale.",1600202397,1600202397,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198002449230,356,38,1318,0,1314,1600809129

Game play is overall what i would want from a Marvel Avengers game. Motions feel smooth once you get a hang of the controls. However the sound design is kind of.. S***. If you go off the background music for scenes you'll either think that some of is lazy or they cut A LOT of content before release. Campaign is short and sweet, which is nice if you want something quick to run through, but the end game content feels like it's lacking in many aspects. However since the game only released this month, i'm hoping they add more content. Something maybe with more story to it then just, ""Do this dropzone."" Over and over again. Maybe even more Hero's? Add more to the pool for players to unlock, and perferably through gameplay, not some cash only bulls***.

I have been a superhero fan since a kid in the 90s watching the X-Men, Christopher Reeves as Superman and Linda Carter as Wonder Woman. My love of them grew leaps and bounds with Marvel Heroes, not my first super hero game but the first I got hooked on. I miss it dearly and I don't think a game will ever replace it. It had the perfect mix of Marvel and Diablo style isometric camera and loot fest. That's the kind of game I like and wish this one was.

The campaign in exceptionally well done though I really don't like linear on rails gameplay. I enjoyed it, but I really just wanted to be done with it so I could move on to the grind for gear. MY OCD would not allow me to skip it. Kamala starts off a little annoying and somewhat overdone but she became my favorite and was an amazing protagonist. 

In the future I'd like to see more lesser known heroes and some non-matchmaking multiplayer like Midtown Manhattan or High Town like Marvel Heroes had. Disorganized cooperative fun running around battling baddies for hours. I'd also like to see more multiplayer aspects like a hub to see other players with vendors or something, without matchmaking.

So to start off yes, on PC it has been pretty unstable, but so far I've not encountered anything that made it so I couldn't proceed.   And yes, crashing has been a problem, but when I have been able to play with 3 other friends, it's some of the most fun I have had in a Co op game in a very long time.

What really won me over is that while yes, this is someone trying to do 'Destiny but with Marvel' it turns out there is a lot of real love and affection shown for these characters throughout the game.  Kamala in particularly is just unbelievably charming.

The end game is maybe sparse now, but so to was Destiny 2, and that continued to grow and improve.  And reading between the lines I think they are sewing the seeds for some seriously cool stuff they could do in the future and I am excited to see where they go.

I wish the game was like spiderman because that was a bomb ass game. No real free roam so it limits the game to dumb missions, the leveling system is trash makes it fell like a knock off Destiny. The did Ms.Marvel dirty in the final boss fight like wow what was the point. Then we have the point where every character feels like glass and killed within 3 hits. Computer AI barley helps and often stands around in fights and good luck finding someone to play with because it never happens.

93,76020998,english,"I picked Avengers up after hearing that it offered Destiny-style looting in a co-op brawler package that would see free class updates in the form of new heroes. I am not a particularly avid fan of Marvel, although I read Spider-Man and X-Men comics excessively when I was 10 or 11 and was very disappointed to hear about the exclusivity deal.

Still, the idea of getting to play a raid encounter with the avengers and having a new Games-as-a-Service product to waste time on was extremely appealing, so I dropped full retail price on Marvel's Avengers and played it almost exclusively for about a week. Unfortunately, it is a hard game to recommend in its current state.

To begin with, even when the game functions as intended you can tell that this is a Crystal Dynamics product. The scripted platforming sections during the campaign set-pieces often fall apart and send you careening awkwardly to your death if you do not jump the exact way that they intend for you to jump. Characters sometimes fall through the level geometry and spiral endlessly until you happen to clip into the killbox. Cut scenes and character interactions often break mid-scene, causing an Avenger to speak, stone-faced, without moving their lips. I wouldn't call it immersion-breaking since I never feel immersed in the world of Destiny's Avengers to begin with, but I was often forced to ask myself, ""Is this supposed to look this way?""

Plenty has been said about the campaign itself in larger publications. As with most loot games, the need to auto-equip better loot every 15 minutes is an annoying chore given how sluggish the menus can feel at times and I wish gear score was simply disabled or scaled out of consideration for the campaign, especially in order to let players tackle the often-high leveled side content that contains some of the better characterization in the game. The story is pretty standard comic books shit, but Kamala is an extremely charming character even as a Funko Pops-type Avengers fan, and there are enough surprises and draws from Marvel comics that I was suitably entertained the entire time.

Once you complete the campaign, Avengers spits you out into the proper loot game section of the game. Tutorialization here is pretty non-existent, although you do get a series of questlines that try to direct you somewhat into the post-game story. I find this a mindless but satisfying grind at times, and I enjoy plugging in a few hours of gear farming while chatting with friends on Discord.

The problem with the game is that matchmaking is horribly broken, and queue times should you try to play with strangers in a specific mission are seemingly eternal. Often, the game decides to never match you with other players at all, and I often find myself in situations where a single player cannot load into the area, causing the remaining three players to wait in the jet until they leave, at which point the level loads immediately. On two separate occasions, I've had to completely exit out of a level because an enemy has spawned outside the level geometry, or no enemies ever spawn at all, which renders us unable to complete the objective and advance to the next map. Reloading checkpoints does not seem to remedy these issues at all, which means we have to exit the level entirely and play it from scratch. Luckily, as a live game you get to keep all gear drops and skill points acquired up until that point, but some of the levels stretch to the 30-minute mark. I imagine losing all progress near the end of a difficult HIVE is MADDENING.

Finally, the combat feels thoroughly unbalanced in favor of enemies right now. Even when fully geared or over-geared for an encounter, ranged attacks still stagger and line you up for a two-hit kill. If you're playing single player because the game refused to match you with other players, you only get two downs before the checkpoint resets entirely, since solo players need to be punished for some inscrutable reason. The AI is, luckily, quite supportive so you won't sit waiting for a revive while watching the AI bumble around the room, but getting downed three times in a row by rockets and restarting the room is an all-too-common experience.

I don't plan on dropping this game personally, and I'm eager to see how it shapes up when CD is given the time to apply the polish that they no doubt wanted to have present on release. I'm eager to see matchmaking run a little smoother, and I'm hopeful that voice chat will be added on PC for players who don't have a headset. I'm excited to see what an endgame raid activity looks like in a hero brawler, and I'm always thrilled watching the Hulk and Cap team up to tear a robot in two pieces. This game has a surprisingly exciting and charming campaign, and when the action is running smoothly, it's a sight to behold. Unfortunately, Disney demanded this get shoved out into the world prematurely, and now we have to wait while CD is forced to issue live updates for their service while bringing the game to the 1.0 status that it never had time to reach.

Pro:
- Beautiful game all around definitely visual eye candy.
- Fun fighting mechanics.
- Great story from what I have played.

Cons:
- Stability issues (which I don't blame the dev's. A title like this thats a lot of pressure.)
- Tried to cater to too many different features. (I'll explain further down.)
- I wont say poor but not really quality voice acting.

So lets talks about this trying to cater to too many features. We have some new Intel features, A newish AMD feature, and then we piles on a ton of features for NVIDIA and its ray tracing. problem is, they are conflicting with each other. Because they are all set to be on as soon as you start the game. So unless you fool around a lot in all the menu's you wont know. 

Then I also see through testing and playing around that no matter what setting this game is on it has issues remaining stable. It's not the Dev's fault because someone they work for told them put it all in there. That is a ton of work, so now you look at deadlines, trying to solve bugs picked up during alpha and beta testing. Then also trying to figure out what is causing the mass stability issues and how to fix it without totally bricking the game for the millions of fans playing it.

Once you figure that out, you now need to solve the puzzle of how to switch characters. It has something to do with starting a new ""mission"" and selecting that character, but for some reason - whenever I did that, I kept going back to being Ms. Marvel and not being able to talk to Bruce Banner. 

That's just one example of how little this game gives a damn.

This is one of the worst video game experiences I have ever experienced and I think you'll find this game might make you hate the Avengers.

First off, you get a bunch of extremely clunky controls. There's no sense of flow whatsoever, combat is not gratifying.

The designers started from one premise: How do we cultivate an online community of people to give us that sweet microtransaction vanity item income? Instead of starting with a solid gameplay idea, they worked backwards. They designed a whole entire game around this instead of the actual game. The core game is centered around loot rewards.

Loot that when gotten is only some tiny stat increase, - which stat? You don't give a fuck, because there's like 50 of them and you are literally just mashing the attack button the whole time anyways. Dunno, maybe you could kill some guy with 49 repetitive button presses instead of 50. Congratulations. In one minute, you're gonna get another piece that does it in 48. This game over here is stealing ideas from games where tiny stat pushes actually feel good without understanding why (see: Warhammer). There's no sense of strategy, so why would we attribute a sense of importance to only markedly improving gear. I found myself not even swapping to newer higher gear because it was just coming in like some idiot designer just read a blog post about abusing dopamine in game design.

BAD:
- Tutorial is not too that clear.
- Just ... doing the same task over and over again... for level-up your characters and gears. Nothing special.

OVERALL:
 If you are Marvel fans, maybe you can try this game with full price, otherwise I recommend get(try) this game when there
is a discount. Cuz this game still nothing special, just doing the same mission over and over again, and you can just level-up one character during one mission.

And it's insanely repetitive, fighting the same enemies, visiting the same locations, doing the same things again and again. There's just nowhere near enough variety to make this a long lasting experience. I suppose content will be added with time so hey, maybe it will get there. But right now at launch it's pretty... not good. The campaign/story is actually pretty dang good. Well written, well acted, and has some unique scenarios that break up the monotony on the Avengers Initiative multiplayer portion. But I couldn't even recommend that at a full $60 with how many weird bugs I ran into. It lasts about 7-10 hours if that matters to you. I will say that the combat is actually pretty fantastic, it's just the enemies are the same. Oh and they're annoying as shit to fight. Enjoy getting stun locked and bounced around by missile after missile. So yeah, besides content, besides bugs, a total re-work of the enemy combatants and how they engage with you needs to be overhauled completely.  The current battle pass system is also fucking awful and I would like that to be adjusted too. The challenges they ask you to do to fill that battle pass encapsulates the repetition and whole issue with the game. Oh I gotta do 5 totally identical SHIELD vaults? I'd rather chew class... especially when the game crashes during my first vault. About 6 crashes in my 24 hours which isn't awful but boy does it suck to have to redo a section... since redoing the same shit is already the game. A lot of work needs to be done to make this The Avengers game we all deserve. The future free characters and content continuing the story sound promising but we will have to see if that's just more of the same enemies and environments and barely any story or a lovingly crafted mini campaign filled with unique elements and AT LEAST one new enemy.

The game has potential, just down the road I think. If you like Marvel it can be entertaining.

The game is lacking a lot. The campaign feels like one long tutorial, to which some of the 'missions' afterwards are H.A.R.M. training rooms which yet again goes through tutorial on how to play and use some skills.
The online missions are repetitive minus the iconic story missions.
It was annoying that the game keeps on telling you to play the campaign first so you don't have spoilers. To which, if it was a bug, I couldn't play online because it would tell me that I didn't unlock the characters in the campaign yet.
The online play keeps crashing periodically when playing with online with friends. Along with several character bugs like Hulk becoming invisible until a new cutscene, charaters in their standing motion while moving around, and I even had double characters spawn when a teamate got bugged out of the game.
   The stores and the gear for my current level cost way more than they should for the low level gear offered.
The cosmetics can be earned with 1 of the many in game currencies, but they cost a lot for the little you get. Otherwise it's all about that $$.

I do think it could be a good game down the road if they get the bugs fixed and add in a plethora of fresh content with more excitable missions and rewards. As well as looking forward to if they add in more characters. 
I hope they do it better, being a Marvel fan myself.

The game barely works and is insanely buggy, I fell thru the floor multiple times and was sent thru walls. The bugs weren't even funny ones. Characters wouldn't interact with doors properly, Widow's invisibility would cause models to disappear forever. If a move had visuals, the visuals would just stay on screen until you got a lot of meter to be able to do it again.

Your character is in stun for far too long, so if you get hit by a beam (which hits twice) you will get combo'd by the guys on the ground too and there goes your whole health bar. The combat isn't very interesting, it's a lot of running and using projectiles. I just beat the main story and I did not find a single piece of gear that was some interesting attribute. The PC controls just aren't very good either. Quick time events appear at a random part of the screen and not in a consistent point, meaning you have to just be looking around anywhere and everywhere. Dialogue constantly gets interrupted or just won't even play. Hulk was supposed to say something disrespectful to the final boss and he was yelled at bc haha Kamala is a kid haha but whatever was supposed to be crude didn't even play. And that was just the most recent occurrence.

If you are thinking about buying this game, please just buy Ultimate Alliance 3, it's significantly more fun and has a better cast.

You begin with a campaign based on the storyline of ""Ms Marvel"" Kamala Khan attempting to reassemble the Avengers. Once the campaign is complete, you move on to an evolving multiplayer game where the focus is on improving your gear.

Pros:
+ Good campaign. I beat it in about 15 hours or so. Some people claim to have done it in as little as 5, but I think that would be doing a speedrun to rush through. The storyline is solid, if not remarkable, and Kamala Khan is an enjoyable character that reminds me a lot of a young Spider-Man.
+ Fun combat. The combat can be frustrating at times, but overall between the six characters at launch there is a style of combat for everyone. I hated playing as Iron Man, but a lot of other people seem to have enjoyed it. I like Black Widow, on the other hand, whereas others hated her combat style. The combat isn't perfect, though, as enemies can tend to be overpowered. This is particularly true of ranged enemies, who are harder to deal with and can often kill you with one shot. Yet, I found the combat fun, and besides the addiction of trying to improve your gear level, it's really the only thing that keeps me coming back after the main campaign ended.
+ Fun collecting loot. If you play games like Destiny or Borderlands and you enjoy the grind of collecting loot and improving your character's gear score, then you will enjoy this. If you hate that stuff, you should pass on this game.

Cons
- Glitches everywhere. This should improve over time, but the fidelity of the graphics are terrible and often missions and characters bug out making it impossible to complete your objective. There are threads all over the internet describing a wide variety of glitches, and each player seems to have a different problem. It was clear the company launched this game too soon, and it needs more polish. This is the primary reason why I cannot recommend this game right now.
- Multiplayer stinks. If you picked this up in the hopes that there would be a ton of multiplayer, there isn't much. After you beat the main game, the repeatable missions can be done with strike teams of other players online. However, queuing for matchmaking hardly ever works, and I've only been able to find other players to play with a few times. You can have up to four strike team members, and I have never played on a full team of four. I end up just playing the multiplayer missions as a single player, using computer controlled companions of instead of other players to help.
- The end game is undercooked. After you beat the campaign, there are just a ton of generic side missions to do. Many of these are dailys, but many of these are side missions with barely any storyline. They all take place in levels that are extremely similar to one another, to the point where it feels like after the main campaign you are just grinding two or three maps over and over and over again to acquire better loot. This is yet another example of the game feeling rushed and unfinished, as if there should have been more endgame content at launch, but it simply was not ready yet.

Overall, I cannot recommend the game because it feels unpolished and unfinished in its current state. There are too many glitches, not enough multiplayer, and hollow post-campaign content to make this game worth purchasing. However, because the main campaign is enjoyable and the combat is a lot of fun, if you enjoy a game focused on looting to improve your gear score, once the developer irons out most of these problems, the game could be worthy of being recommended, particularly at a discounted price.",1600134696,1600134696,False,350,8,0.915018856525421143,6,True,False,False,76561199087486597,11,1,1617,0,1579,1600590471

I wish there were more level designs though, because it seems like there's only like 3. Still fun, just feels really repetitive sometimes. Also there needs to be more super villains for the faction missions. Also wish you could switch between characters during missions, like MUA. But outside of that, I like it.

I see a lot of people complaining about the game, and a lot haven't even touched it, they just listen to their favorite YouTuber or only the negative. People are buying just to leave negative feedback, then getting a refund. I see people complaining about Kamala(a lot because she's a non white female), and others because she's not one of the major members. That's not what the story is, so it makes perfect sense. Personally, I love the character and she's fun to play with. Somehow liking this game seems to be a sin, and when you say you do, people talk plenty trash about you. Luckily I am literally the only person that matters to me, when it comes to my taste in things.

56,75997045,english,"So, I will recommend this game for these reasons:
- Excellent story
- All playable characters are fun to play and all feel different and unique
- All DLC, battlepass and cosmetics are free to earn
- you can spend money for cosmetics and the battlepass, BUT YOU DON'T NEED TO IT IS ALL FREE.
- Multiplayer missions are fun (can get a little repetitive, but the combat and enemy variation makes it a bit different each time and breaks up the repetitiveness)
- I have found the grind fun and not as bad as others say

Negatives:
so, at the time of writing this which I will hopefully remember to update.
- the main issue I have with the game is that it has a lot of performance issues/bugs. The Devs know and are trying to fix ASAP but with Covid19 it will be a little slow, I would say wait for a few patches if you think this would ruin your experience.
- Content at endgame is lacking a bit. I personally have not felt this but I though it worth mentioning as it seems to be a big issue for most. (but never fear, more content in on the way)

Just making some CoOp things clear that some may not know:
- The game is a CoOp game, but not all missions are CoOp. the main story missions are mostly singleplayer at the beginning, but after the introductions of a few characters and story development the game will introduce CoOp missions for the story.
- Pretty much all side missions are CoOp, only a small few are not.

Overall view on the game:
This game is a very fun story driven experience that expands into a multiplayer looter beat-em up.
I can understand the frustration with the performance and bugs that corrupt the game at the moment, but everything else I have found to be very enjoyable and a real joy to play.

Will just say that I have seen a lot of people give this game a hard time for what I think are silly reasons, but each to their own.

Story starts out great. 10/10. then quickly went down to around 5/10 around midway. Most of the dialogues are the typical character tropes.

aside from the YouTube video I'm about to give that sums up pretty well what I think, most of my beef with the game is this.
1. Bad KBM (especially the mouse) control. Should learn from Batman Arkham series.
2. The world is fake, its a very game-y world where you know... theres a chest at the end of the pathway type of map. Most of the design aren't that applicable in real world (the levels).

1,75976571,english,"It is a fun game. Each character is unique, powerful in their own way. The campaign is pleasant, with an interesting story (although it does not go as deep as it could in the problems the Avengers face) and the voice acting is really good. Thor especially feels like Thor. There is not an awful lot of content but if you're going to do everything, expect around a hundred hours of gameplay while taking your time, much more if you're a completionist always getting the highest numbers. Which, as far as pricing goes nowadays puts Marvel's Avengers' 60€ at a very normal price. Especially since they seem intent on producing free content and characters and pay for further development with cosmetic-shop money which indeed only sells cosmetics and currency of which is obtainable through regular gaming. Only Spiderman has been locked behind Playstation.

Despite that, I highly recommend against this game. We have been served a half finished product that drains most RAMs, is so poorly optimised even lowest settings cause 100% CPU usage on mid-range setups, often causing crashes. (Many, many, many particles for new generation cards and consoles that we cannot turn down and thus this game needs a 2/3000€ setup to run and even then, according to gamers having those setups, it still does crash. Amazing.

There are so many bugs I cannot bear to count them, but amongst the most annoying ones:
- Enemies get stuck in the ground, impeding your progress and forcing you to reload to checkpoint,
- Targeting system is so high-end, black widow zip-lines behind her instead of in front, and towards no enemy, despite looking straight at the enemy and seeing health bar (meaning you are targeting it.)
- Dodging forward often causes you to dodge backwards. Go figure.
- Lots of clipping through geometry from enemies as much as PCs.
- Banter either doubling up or repeating to infinity.

You get the gist.

Do wait for the product to be finished instead of buying 60€ of unfinished and rushed product. I'm not saying wait for a sale, if they fix their mess, this game is going to be worth your time and money (IMO) but do wait until reviews start clearing and acknowledging improvement.",1600114835,1600114835,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198054835238,289,10,5592,1847,2961,1601709771

Game running on my potato: 6/10

The game is pretty fun in general. Underdog story is entertaining and interesting. there is always room for improvement but i still enjoyed playing it and seeing where things would go. Knowing that there is more story to come is something i look forward to in the future. That being said. I do with the main campaign lasted a bit longer. i feel it was somewhat of a tutorial on how to play each character, then they send you to multiplayer saying, ""More story to come!!! in the next comic issue!!!"" like, my characters didnt even get to level 7 doing the main campaign. lol but still interesting story. 

There are lots of bugs still... Game crashed a few times in the middle of a long chain mission that had multiple mini ""Do this side thing!"" objectives, and thats frustrating to have to start it all over again, but wasnt the worst that ive come across at a game launch. 

I do recommend this to friends who love the comics and characters. I love that each character plays completely different and has the potential to work together amazingly if played with friends in multiplayer. I hope little things get fixed and the DLC is amazing.. but thats for the future.. I also saw mention of a handful of other avengers we unlock later through DLC... So hopefully thats a thing.

Multiplayer edit 09/07: Ive dabbled in multiplayer. Specifically matchmaking, My thoughts are, it needs some work. I bet if you just do it with a group of friends it will be just fine. But matchmaking seems to break for me if the match doesnt connect properly and you try to re queue. It wont do anything.... Just stares at you... ive waited as long as 10 min wondering if its just a visual thing. I have to restart the game for it to properly queue again. Not sure if this is a bug or something but im not a fan of it...

BUT.. when multiplayer works... Its pretty fun... out of 10 attempts.. 4 worked.. so i gave it a 4 out of 10 for multiplayer. lol

Update:09/14/2020..... 100+ hours into game...... Leaving my old review up... but im changing this to Not recommend. At its current state.. i cant recommend this game things are starting to be TOOOO repetitive and non rewarding. Loot is broken so you arent getting the drops that you are working soooo hard for... and when you think you should be amazingly powerful for being a superhero... your power feels underwhelming.

----

At first, I thought the reviews about bugginess were mostly overblown - for the first dozen hours, the game ran pretty smoothly by and large, even on high graphic settings at 1440p (other than some weird artifacting and audio gaps).   

HOWEVER, it seems that the longer you play the game... the more it starts to crash.  For me, the first crash happened right before I beat the main campaign.  Now, even after going all the way to low graphics at 1080p, I crash every 30-60 minutes of playtime, with the frame rate taking a nosedive randomly too.  I now have to play on the lowest settings and relaunch the game after every mission and intentionally skip side loot objectives if I want a decent chance of completing a mission without crashing.

These crashes don't even account for the many, MANY other bugs that range from gamebreaking to merely incredibly annoying - including bosses and mandatory groups of enemies who disappear entirely leaving you no way to complete the map (they literally go poof midswing - I blame Mysterio), challenges not completing, progress and costumes getting lost, and visual/audio glitches galore. 

This game should still be in beta, or early access at *best*.   Wait a few weeks, months, or even a year if you've got the patience - the devs will either work aaall the bugs out and this could be a good game, or they won't, and the game will flop and become an FTP Marvel Barbie's Dreamhouse (pay microtransactions to dress up as your favorite superhero).",1599447058,1600078583,False,15,1,0.61346733570098877,1,True,False,False,76561198012248506,9651,32,10123,588,2315,1601393782

The game is an okay addition to the superhero games out there at the moment, the beta didn't do the game justice at all and the worries I had about combat and some other elements went - the button mashing does disappear the further in the game you go - something which the beta didn't show. I really like the character variety and elements of combat. I would have liked Hulk to be a bit more Hulk... he's a little tame certainly at the start. 

That said there's some big issues with the game - the bugs make the game nearly unplayable.

- Bugs - so many bugs... so many. disappearing environment, characters both cut scenes and in game they massively break the story immersion when you get invested and then your character appears without hair. 
- Loot - Loot system is poor. I get what they want with it for multiplayer but the loot is relatively ineffective at times and worse, the only way this could work is if it changed characters appearance.  
- Side Missions - they added side missions to the campaign, this is aside from the hero specific missions (again which are only okay) but the missions are added in so that you don't complete the game too quickly. They are repetitive on the same maps as other missions and add little value or story. 
- Just to go back on the bugs, the game becomes almost unplayable the further you get into it. From all enemies & characters disappearing on screen to the majority of the cutscenes being in invisible terrain or delayed visuals to audio by 2 / 3 minutes. I've got to say for a linear RPG with repeated locations and models for enemies etc. it's one of the most poorly optimised i've seen. 

This isn't because of my rig btw - game runs at 60fps and very few in game lags. It's just terrible optimisation.

[u]Background and Structure of this Review[/u]

Mmkay. I normally don't do game reviews, but I'll do one here, because I don't think this game represents Crystal Dynamics well, when you consider the quality of their Tomb Raider reboot. I currently have 3 of my characters at Level 50 with Power Level 150(Hard Cap).

As you can see from my PFP, I also play Destiny 2. I've played the new God of War, I've played Darksiders, and I played a lot of Diablo III and I'll be making comparisons to all of them.

[u]1) IDENTITY CRISIS[/u]

Lack of vision for this game's identity. This game's current characters play like Kratos in Santa Monica's new God of War, and yet the loot system is that of Destiny 2, but the enemy variance is that of Darksiders. You get absolutely mobbed by enemies while having very few AoE skills yourself to deal with them. The game's combat structure is set around three abilities: your Heroic Support, Heroic Ultimate, and Heroic Assault abilities(Think Destiny 2's Grenade, Melee, and Super abilities in terms of mechanics). This is further supplemented by a Stun meter on enemies, and a dodge mechanic.
[list]
[*]You get mobbed by tons of attack-spamming enemies(both melee and ranged) while you yourself have a kit more based around 1v1 scenarios. You get completely overwhelmed, and chain-staggered to death. 
[*]There are RANGED ENEMIES that take away your energy from Heroic abilities that take around 3-4 minutes to charge up. Unfun game design due to how many enemies can hit you at the same time and chain-stagger you, as mentioned above.
[/list]

[u]2) Loot system[/u]

The loot for this game is one massive gacha system(Think launch build of Diablo III). It's completely RNG-based at the moment. The gear you get, the stats on it, the quality, the perks you get, and the drop rates are ALL RNG-based. There is no logical forward progression and no way to get the perks or stats YOU want. Furthermore, gear pieces you acquire don't actually change your appearance cosmetically like they do in Destiny 2 AT ALL. Huge downside.

The gear system has multiple levels. In ascending order, gear is either Common, Rare, Epic, Legendary, or Exotic.

Exotic gear, which we have seen the mechanics for already in Destiny, have no curated rolls and such a low drop rate it's not even worth farming for. I get better Epic gear than most of the Exotics I've seen people posting on Reddit. Furthermore, Exotics provide no measurable difference in the way you play. They don't provide any extra Exotic-only perks that you can't get from Epics or Legendaries, and the stat distribution/perk distribution is ALSO RNG-based. The ""best loot in the game"" gets supplanted easily by better rolls on ""lower-tiered gear"". Boring design and provides no incentive to upgrade or even keep them.

[u]3) Difficulty[/u]

The difficulty in this game is directly tied to the lack of identity in the game. There are 4 different challenge levels in the game for each mission: Challenge I-IV.
The challenge level literally means nothing. It just determines HP bars of enemies and the higher difficulties just make certain abilities unblockable. It doesn't tone down the amount of ranged attack spam or the aggressiveness of enemies at all. The developer also says higher difficulties award better gear, but I get better gear playing on Challenge II(Normal Difficulty) than I do on Challenge IV, where enemies are just massive bullet sponges with more unblockable attacks. Not worth it. No incentive to play higher difficulties.

[u]4) Instability/Bugs[/u]

Game is in an unplayable state right now. My current PC Specs are as follows:
[list]
[*]AMD Ryzen 7 3800XT CPU(Base clock 3.9, OC'd to 4.5)
[*]MSI X570 GAMING PLUS (With Wi-Fi) Motherboard
[*]MSI GTX 1070 Gaming X 8G GPU (OC'd to 2050 MHz)
[*]G. Skill Trident Z Neo 16 GB DDR4 @3800Mhz RAM (Running at spec)
[*]Acer Predator X34 Monitor
[/list]

The game crashes to desktop routinely without warning in the middle of missions, no matter how low I set my settings and resolution. I imagine this has more to do with the clear lack of optimization and massive VRAM memory leaks.
Currently, BOUGHT COSMETIC ITEMS that you can spend your real-world money on are disappearing from players' inventories and re-locking as if they had never bought them. This is completely unacceptable from a business standpoint, and Square Enix had better fix this quickly if they don't want it to become EA's Battlefront II.

Matchmaking is also a massive issue. Half the time you can't even connect to other players, or you get stuck in infinite loading screens. Playing with the AI teammates isn't awful, but they're clearly trying to be Destiny, so that's the standard I'm going to judge them by.

You get daily faction missions that aren't resetting properly, a character-specific Battle Pass mechanic(Called in-game as a Challenge Card) whose objectives don't reset properly and the objectives furthermore don't even complete properly. Some of them are so unrealistic to complete in-game that you might as well ignore them.

People are falling through level geometry and the game is autosaving them in an infinite falling animation. Only way to counteract this is to have backup saves. If you don't, delete your save and start your whole game over. I thank my lucky stars this bug never happened to me.


[h1]In Summary[/h1]

It feels like I'm playing a pre-Alpha build of a game.
Like I said, I don't think this is representative of Crystal Dynamics. I think Square Enix forced them to deliver this game with their 2020 release date so they could make money off the cosmetic purchases. They didn't care about quality, they wanted this game to be the 2K microtransaction franchise that EA has so they could capitalize off of Disney's commercial success with the MCU.

This reminds me of another game that released in a buggy, unplayable state with multiple game-breaking issues: Batman Arkham Knight's PC release. If you're unfamiliar, the game was so unstable and buggy, it actually had to be recalled on Steam. That's what I feel like should have happened here, and the game should've been put in the development oven for another year.

Sorry, after roughly 100 hours in the first week playing this, I cannot in good conscience recommend this to people. Save your money, wait for a sale AFTER they move from Pre-Alpha to what the game really should have been(Probably late 2021).

Releasing a Destiny 1 release clone in 2020 after watching Bungie make that mistake in 2014 and work so hard to correct it over six years should be regarded as a cardinal sin among MMO game developers.

74,75945331,english,"This game is awesome. Super in-depth skills/combat system/team-building. I've heard it called ""A better Destiny"", and I have to agree 100%! There are a lot of bugs in its current state however, with frequent crashes and disappearing enemies that don't allow you to complete missions. Those are just the game-breaking ones. There are cutscenes that have issues rendering, audio bugs where you won't hear parts of dialogue or SFX, UI elements meant to disappear that don't, and many more.

However, all of that being said, I'm still giving this a positive review. Square has been pretty receptive to what's going on and the devs are working to fix the game as well as add a plethora of new content. Microtransactions in this game also seem tame, with all launch hero's battle passes being given to you. These give you a decent selection of comsetics, and most premium options are recolors of others that you can get in the free passes. It's awesome to see one of these $60 games as a service games that actually gives you your money's worth before asking you to spend more on it.

Do not be fooled however, the game is riddled with technical issues. The game feels very ""Anthem"" like with the current state of the game and end game. There are many ways to build out your characters using gear as modifiers, but the game desperately needs more characters. The starting crew is good, but some characters are clearly weaker than others (Looking at you Hulk).

99,75504831,english,"If I could give this game a sideways thumbs I would. I am aware that others have found the content to be lacking, however, I know that in the future they ""promise"" to provide free content updates and characters. With that being said, I'm sure a lot of you know how Destiny rolls. They come out with their base game, then as time goes by they release content available for purchase or eventually free/discounted to everyone. Knowing that the content in the future for this game will be free I have hope that the game will get better over time.

Performance in this game really needs to be improved. Whenever I'm on a mission that is outside I get much lower frames per second than if I am inside, which makes sense, but that shouldn't be the case. Hopefully over the next few updates in the future will optimize the game for lower end graphics cards. I have a 1080, which does just fine, I get about 90-100 frames per second on medium-high settings when I'm in a building. Being outside is a totally different game entirely. I get around 30-40 frames with MUCH noticeable lag. Occasionally the game will crash for no reason; no freezes, just a crash out of nowhere and I'm left looking at my desktop screen in utter confusion.

Combat. It's fun and it's engaging except it's NOT fluid. What I mean is, there are three aspects I believe that are effecting it: Loot system, dodging, and hit stun. In the beginning you'll struggle a little bit getting used to how each character plays because they all have similar mechanics but move, fight, and play differently. Everyone has something that they can either shoot or throw, which is your main go-to if you don't want to engage up close. THIS is what Iron man mainly does. That's a problem. Sometimes if I want to go up to big boy robotic bob over here and punch him a few times, I can't. Not because my punches don't stun him but because other enemies are stunning ME. There are way to many enemies, especially playing solo, that overwhelm you by stunning you. I can't dodge Mr. Robotic so and so if I am constantly being shot at by dudes who are flying in the air or who just spawned. You might ask, then WHY don't you just kill those guys first then take on the bigger guys. Well, you see, thats what I do and I've gotten the hang of it, however, the problem is, I can still be stunned while trying to take those guys out too and it makes the combat feel very narrow. It's not enjoyable if I have to play a certain way all the time and use the same strategy over and over again. It would be nice actually if they removed any stun attacks. I would actually feel like an avenger and not some wimpy limpy piece of metal that just flies around shooing light beams and hardly ever gets to use any of his close-combat abilities/skills. With these types of games, it's important that if there's going to be a lot of enemies that stun you, there MUST be a good dodging/rolling mechanic. Of course, this is what the game fails at. If I dodge robot A's stun, but if robot B's stun comes right after robot A's stun then it defeats the whole point of dodging. At least in a game like Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, I am able to see WHERE those enemies are shooting from then able to block or reflect those projectiles easily. I feel as though this game wanted to be like Destiny with the loot system, but also wanted to have a tad bit of souls-like in it which just doesn't feel right. It would be better if our heroes had an actual SHIELD bar above our health bar and when depleted THEN we would take hitstun because it makes more sense. The hulk and Ms. Marvel have it as a defensive ability but why not also make it for everyone else? It really sucks when I don't have enough rage as the hulk and I get stunned by some puny robot chomping at my leg.

Overall, I would recommend this game to anyone who doesn't mind all of the things I listed. I hope and do believe that perhaps they will improve things. But who knows, this review could get lost in the other hundreds of other reviews. I do believe as a community we CAN change the game if we really ask for them to do so. For now, stick to the movies and comics, maybe wait until the issues are fixed or when the game goes on sale. I know a lot of what I said can be only viewed as a negative for the entire game but it does have positives and I would be a liar if I said I didn't enjoy the game. Story is intriguing but we'll see if they continue to do so with the future content that they provide.

I like the concept for Marvel's the Avengersl and i can see that there was some genuine thought put in the characters.  However  there are too many bugs to  recommend.  

The main one that i have encountered is the memory leak/crash when playing multiplayer.   Losing progress and  having to start over after spending sometimes 15-20 min+ in the longer multiplayer missions.   It makes you want to go all hulk on your keyboard.  it is almost to the point of not playable.  

 Should you  buy the game at full price: 
    Hell No, even if the game didn't have all of the maddening crash/bugs it is not worth a AAA price.  having said that many AAA games are not worth the price.
If you like marvel and the game goes on sale i would say yes.  when that does i hope that the major bugs are fixed bug/crashes are fixed.

28,75570308,english,"Summary:
This game is so much fun and has so much potential to be even more. I am having a blast. The biggest ""gripe"" or issue, which in all fairness is pretty big - is the optimization of the game. Still recommend it as it is a ton of fun; just know you are doing to deal with quite a bit of bugs and game crashes until fixed.  If you this is a deal breaker for you, just wait a month before picking it up.

Details:
Pros:
- Amazing and Engaging Story
- Combat is fluid, easy-to-use, but has enough depth for mastery
- Each hero feels unique and rewarding
- You get the 6 hero challenge cards included (battle passes for each main character). Each of those includes paths to gain the ""credits"" needed to buy future ones. In fact, you get 1,300 credits per each of the 6 included. Per the developer's official website (Link) [avengers.square-enix-games.com] , You only need 1,000 credits to buy these ""cosmetic only"" battle passes in the future, and you will get credits from them as well.
- Challenges cards are easy to progress.  1 week in and I already have ~25 - 33% complete across all 6.  Will take less than a month to complete each most likely (that is doing half the dailies each week per hero, and the weeklies).  - note the weeklies are bugged and not resetting so this is an issue but the developer has said they are aware and fixing asap.

Cons:
- The biggest issue is by far the optimization . Constant crashing of the game.  Gets really frustrating when you are near completing a mission and it crashes.
- Lighting - also part of optimization, the lighting is off inside the ship/base of operations - it will flicker from outside lighting to how it should be
- other random graphic issues - part of optimization - had a flashing screen one night that I had to close and restart, 2 hulks on the screen, captain's eyes coming out of his head, and other random stuff.
- Some levels are the same, just slightly altered - I wish there was more (but likely as the game progresses there will be more variety).
- Daily/weekly bugs - hero challenges don't always reset, some dont progress like they should, faction dailies also dont always reset.

This last ""issue"" isn't a con per se, but something worth calling out. The gear in this game, unlike The Division, Diablo, Destiny, or any other gear-based games, the gear doesn't change how your character looks, as you always have a cosmetic version of your appearance. Thus, getting new gear may not feel as rewarding in other games, but it does make you more powerful. Some sets will help create builds towards the end game and how you want to spec your superhero.

Overall, it is a fantastic game, and I would recommend it. Maybe just hang tight if you can wait out the optimization issues. I have a fairly decent machine - 1070 Nvidia, 32GB DDR4 3200 Ram, I7-5820k processor; however, I have seen people post with even better equip like the 2080s with the same issues. I could only imagine what is like on lower spec machines. it does seem like the dev team is on top of the issues and working to fix ASAP...they pushed a patched that helped, but it is still a rampant issue.",1599437538,1600037400,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197973954146,128,4,4274,61,3287,1601154177

31,75807695,english,"TL;DR: This is an incomplete, Early Access game, being sold at triple A price, cash grabbing as much as possible from sales AND marketplace.
IMHO save your money and your time, look elsewhere for the time being.

Here's the breakdown why this is so bad right now and cannot be recommended in my experience:

1) Complete lackluster testing, if any. There's several things that you'll notice and will think ""How could this have gone unnoticed?!"", for example, side missions:
There's quite a few of ""rescue ally"" or ""retrieve resource chest"" which are locked behind a console terminal that needs to be hacked by interacting with it OR a breakable door. Basic stuff, all good, right?
EXCEPT, some heroes can do both, some heroes CAN'T DO EITHER (Capt. America, you dummy) and most can only do one of the two. That's very annoying, defeating all the enemies only to find out you are unable to retrieve the chest or rescue the ally.

2) Crashes. A lot of sudden crashes where game is seemingly running smoothly and out of nowhere, back to desktop. I have yet to stay in-game for more than ~45mins without a crash.

3) Capt. America 'classic' skin is now known as ""Face melting"" skin in this game. You'll see it in the Campaign cutscenes, Half of Capt's face will look like that scene from Indiana Jones. In-game too, but not too noticeable since you'll be looking at his back 90% of the times.

4) I'm sick of hitting ""Reload Last Checkpoint"" because Mission objectives become impossible to complete. Specially the ""Secure the area"", ""Clear remaining enemies"" or ""Kill Boss"" because enemies/boss will get stuck inside walls or simply vanish from the map. Do NOT corner enemies and hit them with a heavy hit, or they will go 'noclip' mode. I mean, it's only a beat-em-up game, who would do that anyway, right?! -.-

5) Similar to previous issue also applies to the player and objects in the map. Hitboxes and physical boundaries are badly messed up. Physics do NOT apply here. You'll be falling from the map, pinching, things being catapulted and teleportation happening more often than not.

6) Multiplayer non-existent. Currently at 37 hrs played, still haven't been able to get a SINGLE FULL SQUAD, despite mostly using Quick Match (the option to quickly jump in on a random mission, with a random hero, with other people). You'll be lucky to find another person to play with, unfortunately. The vast majority of my ""multiplayer"" mode has been me and 3 Companion AIs

7) Speaking of Companion AIs, the bots are so poorly designed. They only stick close to you and attack whoever you are attacking. Think of Rocket League Novice Bots, it's on par with that.

8) Very poor balance. There's a myriad of actions to choose from ranging from Dodge, Parry, Counter, light combos, heavy combos, Ranged, 1-2-3 powers, but in reality, feels like the game is designed to have only one acceptable action per moment. If you try to do something else, you'll fail and be hardly punished for it.
No real variety of gameplay. Be either with The Hulk or the Black Widow, so much potential for unique gameplay, so little done in reality.

9) Gear/Loot. Another topic with potential, but oversimplificated, to the point that there's a button you hold that equips the ""highest power level"" gear and that's all that matters. Perks, Synergies, Rarity are about as good as nothing.

I hope this gets fixed in the near future, there's a lot of potential, Campaign was pretty cool, but that was done in 10 hours.",1599847705,1600036757,False,12,0,0.591024816036224365,0,True,False,False,76561197964377678,2767,5,4940,558,2259,1601002604

75,75922530,english,"I really, really want to like this game, but the crashes are unforgivable. When it crashes, it's almost always direct to desktop, no freezing, no lockup... just application gone now. Happens on solo missions, happens on story, happen with every character. And it loses your mission progress, which is the worst. It just crashed on on me in the final stage of the main story-line final boss fight. it often loses items you've picked up, skills, levels, etc. On an always internet connected game, my progress should really never be lost like this. I should be able to start the game back up and have my progress pick me back up in that mission with no progress loss.

I've tried everything I can find online, running as an administrator, running with anti-virus totally disabled (not just excluded), specific settings on, or off Fullscreen, Exclusive Fullscreen, (nVidia's recommended settings cause it to not even be able to start a mission), I've tried disabling Fullscreen Optimizations, using a steam controller, a Nintendo pro controller, on wifi, wired ethernet, shut done every other piece of software on the system. 

Crashes result in no Event Viewer entries, no crash dumps, no useful logging. The only logging is a single file called Marvel's Avengers.log, which has very little information. All but one of my crashes has shown up in here as:
Unhandled exception at address 0x00000000414b593f (code: 0xc0000005): ""Access violation""

The game also has a lot of frame loss, massive CPU spikes (usually during cutscenes, which is a really weird time for it). The farther I've progressed int he game, the more common the crashing becomes. It's just ridiculous. The CPU seems to be by far the biggest bottle neck, as I have 32GB of ram as this game doesn't seem to use more than 6GB or so. The GPU doesn't seem terribly taxed, but I am only playing at 1080p. But the CPU spikes using all cores to 100% definitely happen, making me think they have some runaway threads during the game, and some pieces of their code that badly need some optimization.

1. It did have some graphical bugs in the game. (New game and my computer is not up to date as of right now) However the bugs I did experience did not break the game for me. Everything eventually rendered and I could see what was going on. The stuttering effects also got a bit better over the last week, and I expect they will improve a bit more going forward.

2. The story is no as short as people are making it out to be. The story where you are attempting to re-assemble the Avengers runs to an end and its not super long. I think it may have taken me about 13 hours, but I was smelling the roses and doing everything I could. Looking for lock boxs and saving extra people. I was exploring zones and attempting to keep on top of my gear and stuff. Once this Re-Assemble story is over it opens up a bigger story arc that includes iconic stories from each hero, and a new story based around AIM and what happens after the events of the re-assemble story. This leads you to all corners of the globe and unlocks new mission types including vaults, elite vaults and hives. These are more complex missions that can be harder to do and act as dungeons or raids so to speak. 

3. Its the same thing over and over. Well I have to say every game is this. I have played multiple MMOs and each of them have some repeating of stuff same skills same uses. The repeating skills get less so the more you level up your heroes as they learn new abilities and ways to use them. You can end up with less repeating skills and greater set of options as they level up. 

4. This game will continue to get new love and stories added on.

If you are buying this game thinking it to be just a single player experience and a story, pass on it, there is lots to do in the game solo, but if you just want that story, its much more then that. This game was not made for just that, it was made to be a multiplayer game with the ability to play in groups of friends to accomplish things together. The only thing I am currently missing in this game is a group of people to play with on a regular basis.

This review will contain ZERO spoilers for Marvel's Avengers, this is a review for players who are thinking about buything Marvel's Avengers.

Marvel's Avengers is a third-person action-adventure game with both a single-player story mode and a co-operative gameplay.

[h1] Pros : [/h1]

-A fun and enjoyable story.
-All six heros has own unqiue attacks, skins, weapons and skills.
-Although the game doesn't look super realistic with all the colors, the game still looks beautiful.
-Great voice actors for all the characters.
-The campaign has cool cutsceens with fun missions.
-Cool skills that you can unlock, this can be amazing and new attacks to every hero.
-Incase you wanna play alone on a co-operative mission then the other heros will be bots, I do not recommand playing alone though but the choice is still on the table.

[h1] Cons : [/h1]

-At the moment the game costs 60 dollars, I think that price is to much for what you gets and I recommand waiting until the game costs 40-45 dollars.
-The game has a marketplace, I don't feel like a game like this should have a marketplace.
-If you wanna unlock every skin/icon then you HAVE to spend real life money.
-The skins in the game is awful, most of the skins are just recolorings and there is zero Variety. The game doesn't really have iconic coustumes from the comics either.
-The game has a gear system that doesn't work well with the game, the gear doesn't change your characters cosmetics in any way either.
-The characters are speaking ALL the time, like every single second The voice actors should get a raise.
-There is resources in the game that you can find though the game and can be used to update your gears, I didn't update my gear once in my entire playthough because you keep on finding better and better gear every second which makes the resources kinda useless.
-The endgame with the co-operative missions isn't so fun in my opinion. I didn't spend much time on the game after finishing the campaign.
-If you're only playing the campaign which a lot of people are then the length of the game is only 10-12 hours which is a joke.
-There is a ""big"" plot twist near the end which everyone probably expected the second they started the game.
-This is probably a game that a non-marvel fan wouldn't enjoy.

[h1] Worth buying? [/h1]

The game is far from good but I would still not call it bad, the biggest problem of the game is the price and the length of the campaign. I think the game would be better if they focused more on the main campaign and less on the co-operative endgame missions. If the short campaign wasn't so good then I would NEVER recommand this game but the campaign is pretty enjoyable although the experience doesn't last for long. I give this game a 6/10. If you're low on money then you should wait for a sale or just buy Marvel's Spider-Man instead if you own a PS4. The game is just decent.",1600017083,1600017083,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198273926532,168,12,1293,0,1293,1599840226

Still has problems...and would have chosen the X-Men over the Avengers...
But as a ""First""...its a start. 

Sure, beating off for better gear is futile and childish...
But the Animation, Story and Control are the closest we have ever got to play an actual ""Marvel"" video game.
I will buy the PS5 this x-mas for the next Spiderman...

Yet squarenix and everyone involved have created the suite on which better, more elaborate and satisfying games...are merely a matter of time.

Nightcrawler would be the dopest hero ever to play.

I didn't try out the multiplayer yet as none of my friends could even afford it, but the side tasks (characters missions and bosses) are very tiring and requires you to grind a lot. A lot of microtransactions for cosmetics (costumes and stuff), but nothing pay to win so far, I think. Wait for sale if you're a fan of Marvel or superhero games in general (have never seen one on PC in a long time).",1600014190,1600014190,True,0,0,0.499108701944351196,0,True,False,False,76561198413875277,261,36,2175,0,2175,1599555707

The characters all felt human enough, each with their own personalities expertly portrayed by a stellar cast, and they all provided a unique experience in combat and exploration, as they all have certain aspects in which they excel and where they fall behind. The story, while predictable in parts and definitely not without its share of cheesy dialogue, provided a fun 14 hour experience, with only a minimal amount of side quest grinding required to up my heroes power level to be strong enough for the next campaign mission, providing good pacing without making the game feel too long or too short. I do recommend this game for anyone who, like myself, is a fan of the comics and wants to experience this original Avengers story, but for anyone still on the fence I'd say wait it out for now.

1,75493389,english,"I have currently played just over 11 hours at the time of this review. The game so far is really fun and the beta really didn't do the story they have put together any justice. 

I recommend taking your time exploring the levels in the campaign. There are plenty of extra areas, hidden caches and vaults to find. The campaign has so many nice touches and easter eggs all over the place which Marvel fans will love.

There are some good foundations here and you can see the potential for the future of the game. I hope that the content keeps coming at a steady rate as the game could go far not only story wise but with additional abilities for existing characters and new characters on top of that.

Edit:

Having now played some 47 hours of the game I thought an update was in order. I have reached level 50 and my gear is around the 135 mark. I haven't played the same mission twice yet but you do get missions that are almost identical to others. However, the mission chains for the Inhumans and Shield have kept me entertained (nod to Maria Hill for turning up with a Rocket Launcher to blast taskmaster).

The boss fights are a nice option, however, some variety in setting would be nice. It was a bit disappointing to end up in the same location/room to fight abomination as I fought Taskmaster in. A setting that was unique to each boss would have been better, preferably one that gave each their own advantage over your team.

The combat kept improving as I unlocked moves on the skill tree, adding a lot of possible combos and chaining. The additional two skill trees allow you to tailor the character to your own play style. I have gone for a support Captain America, popping up health and heroic globes for everyone to keep them in strong fighting shape. There are additional takedowns to the two you start with. So far I have seen one unlockable through Character card progress and another with in game earned credits. Also worth mentioning are the team up combos which will take down even the toughest enemies very quickly.

I have seen people complaining of a character being weak damage wise or going down in one or two hits. This brings me to another customisation point. The gear is not only about power level. Each piece of gear has stats on it, these can overlap but fall into four main categories - Melee, Defence, Ranged, Heroic. The numbers may look small on the gear but they actually translate into a huge difference on the character. Changing one item on my Captain America took him from 9k health to 13.5k health. For groups it's important later on to have at least one character that can take a beating with high health and armour ratings.

I can see a lot of players choosing their gear based only on the power level. I'm guessing there are plenty of characters running around with ill suited gear for example a Hulk with high ranged stats wondering why they are doing low melee damage and have low health. If you want to check your character stats, you can cursor over the four categories on the character menu screen.

The future is looking promising with a couple of raids including one for Wakanda being on the cards along with other new heroes in the next month or so.",1599322698,1600011153,True,1,0,0.503610134124755859,0,True,False,False,76561197970426605,415,2,4902,517,3241,1601669535

Edit :

I want to expand on my original ""review"" because i feel like this game does deserve a review and not just a reference due to 1 voice actor.
Now i normally dont really put allot of work into  reviews because who cares what someone on steam thinks really yet im still typing ugh.

Im just going to come out and say it, i like this game.
I hear some people have techinical issues but i simply have none at all.
The only buggs i run into now and then is someone in a weird pose wich is pretty funny to me seeing its not happening to much wich keeps it funny.
And one time i found a iron man helmet on the floor in a weird place and deffinetly not in an intended way. [screenshot somewhere on my profile who cares]

But why do i like it ? 
I mean its repetitive as all hell and at the moment there isnt really something resembling end game content, though i dont know what end game content in something like this should look like?
Yeh i know that all sounds horrible i geuss i feel ya.
But for me this feels like something ive wanted for a long time, a up to date beat em up.
I grew up with games like streets of rage and golden axe etc, and later on there wer some attempts at ""3d"" types of these games wich wer incredibly hit and miss but mostly easely forgotton about.

And now after all these years its here, sort of.
This to me feels like a ""modern beat em up"".
Now sure it has loot wich i personally dont care about but i geuss they have to add something nowdays for people to get a feeling of progress, seeing its ofton unpopular to just play something for fun now i geuss?
And if they had based it on something like player skill that brings way more problems than loot would, so to me they went with the lesser evil in todays society.

Now talking about Evil, the monitization.
Wooo boy yeh its there and they do not hide how badly they want your money.
But still i find myself not caring, and wanting money for a new character when its released i dont mind because thats still cheaper then buying a new game that includes new characters.
And being able to pay for shortcuts when it comes to unlocking emotes or skins cmon man thats completely up to you, as long as its not locked behind a gamble wall im ok with it.
As long as there is still added that you can unlock for free in a game revolving around lvling and loot im fine, no matter the grind it takes.
Because to me the game is just fun and i will play it anyways, and if i find some skin in the progress well thats cute and all but heavely secondary to gameplay.

Now one thing i must say, i LOVED the campaign.
Games have come a long way from the ""beat em ups"" of yore, and if the graphics dont show it the campaign sure does.
I just WISH games would STOP shoving a small quick time events into obvious cutscenes.
Its not like your asking me to watch a movie when i want to play a game.
If its a couple seconds just show me, dont make me focus on the centre for what button to mash next it ruins the detail you put into the scene.
Because boy did they have some nice scenes like OMG such a shame making me stare at the centre of the screen for those 3 fckin buttons you want me to mash like it matters.

I am not a fan of the movies they are dumbed down versions of the comics and evry1 has the same stupid disney humour  all to please the kids. 
And its sad they had great actors who fit the roles so well only to make it pg-13 or however it works over in America.
Wait this was about a game... What im trying to say is for me personally the game is better than the movies.

I cannot speak of how good or bad the loot drop rate or what you may call it is.
Because i dont like loot based games and pay little to no attention to them.

Feel like they had a lot of potential to do something great with this game but really missed the mark. When the game was actually running good i had an okay time...mostly because the combat feels pretty good. Everything else i found forgettable honestly. The gear system just doesn't feel fleshed out enough, its just a thing you have to do if you want to power up your hero. Compare to something like destiny where a new weapon might change the way you approach a fight or situation...in here my new chest piece makes my ranged attack increase my 2%...nice...

I really hate saying a game will be good once it has DLC...cause it should be good now. But a year down the line with some TLC this could be a really good time. But they need more hero's...more variety in enemies. Side missions that are longer then 5 minutes. But most of all they just need to optimize this. i7-9700k 2080ti and 32gb RAM and for big portions of this game it was a choppy mess. Needing a reboot every few hours to keep it running smooth.

O Grind, depois de um tempo fica chato pois são sempre as mesmas missões, como por ex as missões de matar BOSS, que só existem 2 no jogo por enquanto.

6,75910942,english,"Good game with too many flaws to recommend at the current price.

Pros:
- The story is pretty well done, and enjoyable.
- Each character feels fun and unique to play (hulk is my favorite)
- Visuals look really nice even at mid settings

Cons:
- Performance is all over the place and certain features that are suppose be used to get a stable 60 fps do not work properly (mainly Dynamic Resolution causes random crashes).

- The ARPG aspects are pretty bare-bones and by this I mean: Loot is very poorly done (most gear is pretty generic with only things like Gamma, Particle, and Plasma to make the drops interesting), Loot has no visual representation, only set costumes per character (even the costumes are very uninteresting), Build variety also seems pretty shallow. (Similar ARPGs did this aspect way better, Division, Grim Dawn, Borderlands, Destiny, Marvel Heroes...etc)

- No memorable Marvel villains besides MODOK. They have the whole Marvel universe to pick from and there are only 3.... THREE villains you can fight in the entire game (I was very disappointed in this)

- Grinding feels useless because until you get to max level (130-150) enemies all scale with you. So even when you equip the best gear you find for your build, you rarely feel powerful until the very endgame. This pretty much discouraged me from play other characters from low levels due to the boring loot grind. I would have liked missions with set power levels that you had to work toward to complete.

- Current end game is very bare-bones, its just recycled missions/objectives used to farm for better gear (with terrible drops btw). I also have yet to get a exotic drop for my character (not including the 2 exotic mission rewards).

Overall the game is fun to play but the ARPG design of the game is very poor in comparison to other games currently on the market. I would much rather play other games for loot grinding and creating new builds (Division 2 and Grim Dawn, my current favorites). I will check back in from time to time to try out the new characters/content but at the moment I feel like I am wasting away my time trying to endlessly farm for meaningless gear.

I cannot recommend at the current price and without the Marvel coat of paint this game would be average at best.

-Fantastic Story Mode (For your first 20-30 hours of game play without Multiplayer)
-Perfect voice acting (Including my holy trio of Troy Baker, Nolan North, and Laura Bailey)
-Great range of characters
-Nostalgic for comic book fans and MCU fans

Cons:
-Multiplayer is broken
-Joining your first multiplayer match will lock you to that ""random"" character until you close the game and relaunch
-Players in your multiplayer party will completely disappear from the party menu, leaving you guessing whether or not they're actually there before you launch a mission
-You can float in midair with Cap if you just keep kicking the shield at enemies
-Hulk dies in 3 hits if you happen to get him in a high power level mission
-You can't change the difficulty of missions in multiplayer
-You can't open certain doors without specific characters, so if you don't have them in your party, too bad.
-You can't compare stats with new gear

I wanted to like this game. I heard about all the live-service crap, but against better judgement I decided to give it a chance. 

Big mistake

1)The level design is atrocious: horribly bland and wholly uninteresting.
2)The combat is dogsh*t.
3)The story is meh - definitely not good enough to keep me invested.
4)the enemy variety is severely lacking - all the enemies feel the same.
5)Mission variety is terrible. Everything just boils down to either stand in this point to secure it, kill these specific enemies, or kill everyone. Gets repetitive real quick.
6)Offline companion AI, surprise surprise, is completely brainless.
7) Enemy AI is even worse: all they do is just mindlessly rush you like it's vanilla Skyrim
8) Gear is tedious as hell and adds no cosmetic variety, but you can't ignore the system because it's needed to approach higher level missions, so you end up constantly fiddling around with the gear menu every 5 minutes.
9)You want actual cosmetics? Better fork out real-world money or be prepared to grind for dozens of hours to get enough credits to buy one low-rarity skin.

10) (The cherry on the sh*t-sundae) All of the playable heroes share the same core mechanics... Why does this matter? Well, stop me if this sounds familiar:

parrying last second to counter an attack
dodging a punch from some random goon
Having to vault over shield enemies to hit them from the back
Spam dodge button to avoid gunfire

That's right! It's every 3rd person action game since 2009. The problem is that we are supposed to be playing as unique superheroes here. Dodging an attack last second and landing a precise counterstrike makes sense for a hero like Black Widow, for example, but it's real dumb when a random 5'6 manlet can completely shut down the Hulk's frenzied arm flailing with some tiny shield. Some Heroes like Hulk, Iron Man, and Thor end up feeling really weak and nerfed as a result

- Endgame has taken heavy inspiration from Warframe imo
- The heroes are all capable of doing similar things melee/range in a slightly different way (similar to frames)
- The missions are also similar as they're mostly run through a level destory/hack/hold a thing, while fighting waves of enemies. As you run through the levels you open boxes and hit other boxes for mats and loot. (like Warframe)
- The levels have verticality to them with some platforming and some characters have flight.
- There are several factions to earn rep with for power and cosmetics, the power is seperate from the cosmetics. (very similar to bounties in Destiny 2)
- There is a power cap that doesn't very hard to reach, i guess they will increase with seasons?

Cons:
- Crashes have increased later in the endgame. Haven't been able to finish a Hive without crashing (5-6 Floors of enemies)

I started my Avengers play through on Brutal, which is the hardest mode. Expecting it to be a very pretty, easy once over with mediocre but fun combat. If it was just that I would probably be happy to be honest, that's how these games usually go. We don't get high quality super hero games that often. What I got was an action hero technical masterpiece that INDEED was brutal. I found the combat very fun to learn. Spent many many retries on hulk just having fun getting my ass kicked. The combat is no joke, a mix between various arpg and brawler games from recent years. It's fun, complex and challenging. The audio, visuals, animation, cut scenes are all top notch. We have finally hit the technical capabilities to really pull of a super hero game. 

What I found very early on though is that the game has it's bugs on launch. Fighting an early boss he would simply fade through a wall and vanish. I had to turn down the difficulty numerous times due to bugs. Which sadly, holds this game back from a 9.5+, more on that later. Other than the couple times that happened the story played great for me. I love Kamala and it introduced me to the inhuman story line which has drawn me back into the world of comics.

The story was very nostalgic and emotional. Involving lots of mutant side characters which I always love. Many reviewers said the Avengers felt dead compared to their hollywood counterparts. But I had the opposite experience, as a reader first. Bruce felt like Bruce, Cap like Cap and on! Now the story once through on mainly Brutal taking my time was about 20 hours. The game is just as much an online multiplayer experience akin to Vindictus, Warframe... where you have a main lobby to join or go on specific missions either multiplayer or solo with ai teammates.

Currently you can bring your characters to level 50 and item level 150. There are various missions you can team up and complete like boss fights or objectives. There's also a lot to roam around and explore and collect. At 80 hours I've brought captain America to max level and completed all the current in game missions.

That's where we slow down currently. About half way through the main story I noticed the game speeding up. You start unlocking characters more quickly and play them less. It goes from a slow enjoyable burn to a sort of overwhelming chaotic smash fest. It feels like there was supposed to be more time in the campaign and spent with the other characters. It is clear to me the online multi player part of the game are a foundation for a ongoing Marvel mmo brawler/looter. It's also clear they didn't complete everything they had wished in time. Which I don't blame them for as this game pulls off what no game has done before. My friend walked into a room with 20-30 enemies and performed a Hulk Slap ult. I had to pause as I watched more things explode in front of my eyes in a new way than ever before. It's insane how this game plays.

So as of right now I'm leveling up my lower levels, taking my time while we wait to see what they are bringing to polish the game and future content. Sadly at max level there isn't much progress except soloing a 15 level mission for exotic loot. 

Amazing game, great story, campaign, very fun multiplayer. Sadly with bugs and needing more I give it:
7.8/10
If you are a Marvel / arpg fan and enjoy multiplayer you will probably enjoy this game.
If the price is expensive for you wait.
I hope to see them iron out the bugs, flesh out end game and turn it into a 9.5/10.
I recommend this game to Marvel fans, who love ARPG online games. That can handle some bugs and understand an early online service title. You must have a good PC and enough money to blow $50+ on a game. Good Luck Avengers

20,75872947,english," If this game launched as an early access title, I might be able to recommend it, because at least consumers would be forewarned about what they are getting into. Instead, the developers lied to the player base, saying that the bugs experienced in the beta 1 month prior to launch were due to the fact the beta was of a much older game build than what it would launch with. Well launch has came and went and all the problems that persisted in the beta exist still today.

 Let me talk about some of the worst bugs/glitches (because there are literally hundreds of different ones): 
- Lost progression after corrupted save files
- Lost cosmetics (even purchased ones)
- Crashes across consoles and PC alike. Overall poor optimization leading to overheating of hardware in extreme cases (clean your rigs people)
- Infinite loading screen bugs that cause you to have to start progress all over
- Some bugs in missions where you can't complete them with a certain character at a certain time, so again you'll have to start a new save for the game. Basically, frequent back ups are a must.
-Lack of matchmaking

 Other minor bugs include:
- fps drops
- graphical and audio glitches
- enemies requiring elimination before progression will disappear and need a refreshed checkpoint or game restart to fix
- UI bugs

 Honestly, the discord and subreddit for this game are absolutely full of all the different issues in the game. That could be a good place to look, if you are interested in picking the game up. I know I have been harping on the game over technical issues, but how is the actual game you might ask. I'll go into some simple pros and cons.

 Pros:
- Good campaign, solid story and great characters.
- Fun and engaging combat
- Playing as Avengers obviously
- Solid RPG design in terms of character progression and skill builds.
- Quality voice acting
- Free DLC content as time goes on

 Cons:
- Campaign is short at 10-12 hours of a story mode and a lack of campaign replayability.
- The horrendous technical state of the game
- Lack of Marvel villains (only 3, and you'll fight the same two like 10 times a week)
- Uninspired and unrewarding loot system ( Honestly disappointing in a looter rpg genre game )
- Lack of environmental diverserty. All the levels are very copy and paste. The buildings are all the same.
- Poor character animations in cut scenes to fit the great voice acting. It's a little jarring.
- Lots of loading screens and discrete loading times disguised as elevator usage
- Very noticable shortcuts taken in things like takedown animations (that they sell for like $12 on the marketplace)
- Among the worst triple A game microtransaction system I've seen. F2P games have better value in their store

 Wait for a sale, as I fully expect the price to drop by half within a couple months. By then the technical issues will hopefully be solved and more content should have been added too. The game is only worthwhile if you're a Marvel fan and even then you have to really like looter games if you want to get your monies worth now. If you're only a fan of looters and don't care for Marvel, then definitely skip, as there are better games in the genre.",1599946724,1599946724,False,3,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False,76561198087142593,51,2,2649,6,2408,1601242342

27,75871537,english,"TL;DR
- campaign - story, acting and combat are great, making this game worth your time
- there are bugs, some are minor, some can be gamebreaking, but I trust the devs to fix them in time
- post game is very repetitive and is not for everyone
Even though I marked I would recommend this game, it's not a 100% yes, people need to know what they are getting before buying this game.
First few hours of the game is thrilling. Really feels like a comic book brought to life. Story is excellent, acting and combat is great, and sure there are bugs (which should not be completely overlooked) but overall the campaign makes this game very recommended if what you're looking for is a fun single player game.

However, there are two major issues with the game - Post game, and bugs.
The post game in this game is not for everyone, people should know what they are getting is a repetitive looter shooter if they are aiming for playing this game long term. This may or may not change as the devs add more content and levels.

Bugs in this game can be a nightmare. I was lucky enough to encounter none during the course of the campaign but as was nearing the end of the campaign I started to encounter flickering screens, crashes and other, sometime gamebreaking, bugs. I would gladly change this part of the review if and when they are fixed, but it should be noted that the devs are very communicative with the players about what they are working on through reddit and discord, so I'm pretty sure bugs will be fixed with time.

Just so I don't end this on a negative point, I'll say again that the voice acting and combat in this game are great, and they chose a perfect cast to play the avengers (some of which already portrayed their avenger in other animated shows and games). If you're looking for a good story-driven rpg and aren't concerned about a long term game, this game fits.",1599944742,1599944742,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198055515817,58,2,2681,0,2359,1600291266

30,75870886,english,"As much as I was looking forward to this game, I must say it is deeply disappointing. The graphics, voice-acting and most of the gameplay is actually good, but the myriad bugs & glitches I've encountered, let alone those others have found, reduce my opinion of this game greatly.

The way they have given you 6 playable characters, each with their own moves and skills is quite impressive. The voices are excellent, drawing on the likes of Troy Baker, Nolan North and Laura Bailey to great effect and the graphics are top notch. The story of the campaign is interesting, given its setting in a Marvel universe where all heroes are banned. 

However, this is where my issues with this game begin; The campaign is really too short. I'm on the final mission now after just 14 hours of play. I'm not the biggest fan of online multiplayer, and going into this as blind about the game as I was, did not prepare me for how focused it is on multiplayer. It does feel a little like Destiny or Warframe. Within the game itself, there are campaign missions as well as side quests, the latter of which really don't add to the story, but do add to your characters gear and skills, but for me there is just not enough content on launch to justify this game being a full price AAA game. In the UK this is £50 for what is essentially 15-20 hours of non-repeating content. I've never been one to enjoy grinding to improve my skills and abilities in a game, and I am disappointed they went this route with this game.

What really gave me a bad taste with this game was just how unfinished it feels. The main glitches/bugs I encountered was being stuck in the Gear menu, and the only way to fix it was to either deconstruct some gear, or if I had no gear I had to fully quit the game and go back in. There were many times the game just crashed with no warning, the subtitle system is choppy and not synced with the voice-acting, the camera sometimes wobbles about when on the Chimera and a whole quest to obtain new suits for all team members completely skipped when I quit the game and re-entered it. And this is just my experience! Others have reported no way to start certain campaign missions, unlocked cosmetics not working and much more.

Overall, I really cannot recommend this game to those who were looking for a great singleplayer experience. If you enjoy grinding the same 5-10 mission types for 30 hours+ then you might like that, and there is more content on the way, but I somewhat regret my purchase.

I'd give Marvel's Avengers a 4/10.",1599943761,1599943761,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198026657913,55,2,874,0,845,1600104645

4.  The story, if you blitz through the main story mode Id wager you could complete the game in 5-6 hours.
5.   Good luck if you want CONSOLE EXCLUSIVE characters like Spiderman (PS4) and other planned character releases.
6.  The story is pretty boring and ultimately does nothing new except try to bring Kamala Khan to the frontline of Marvel.  The opinions on her is that she is either extremely annoying to the point where she just doesn't feel like she belongs in the story, or tthat youll love her.

I haven't played a single multiplayer game with a full squad as it takes so long to find 1 person to play with they often ready up that gives you 1 minute to wait for more players. I played through the campaign and only had enough credits to afford the cheapest costume in the in game store! Also as far as I have seen the multiplayer does not add maps or objectives. It reuses the campaign maps... If this game expects to be a live service game for long it needs to be more rewarding! and have more variety. The combat is ok but it feels like the full skill tree is what you should start the game with and go up from there. 

This doesn't even cover the technical issues. I have had stuttering and freezes. Also multiple menu glitches, such as the menu overlay being stuck in while cutscenes play. It also lacks some user friendly interface. If you are waiting for players to join your game and you are checking your character items or skins you are not warned it someone enters and  readies up. It just doesn't feel like a finished game!

P.S. Hulk is still busted from the beta.. I die faster as The incredible Hulk than I do as Kamala Kahn. I feel like his hitbox lets him take too much damage despite him being the freaking Hulk and should be able to take the most damage. You barely see anyone online playing as ""The strongest avenger"" because he does not feel strong or tough. I say wait for this to go on sail for about 10-15 dollars if you are a fan. The price is just too high right now for what you get given that you could play something like Warframe for free that feels more solid and cheaper if you want cosmetics!

The loot system doesn't make much sense. Sometimes in the campaign you're forced to do certain missions as certain characters, if this character differs from the one you main as, they're considerably weaker and results in you dying more often. 

During the later portions of the game, my game kept lagging, kicked out the connection with my controller and caused the frame-rate to drop by a major amount, leaving the game to be unplayable. Usually I would just say it's because my computer isn't powerful enough, but it is. Passes with flying colours when you compare the specs. Not sure if the game has been properly rendered.

55,75864670,english,"There's a lot to recommend about this game. There are also still a lot of bugs, but the game was pushed out without solid beta testing, something I think is more the fault of Covid-19 than the corporate squeeze (though, Cyberpunk is proving that you can continue to push back a game to make sure it's working). 
Honestly, I think the release should have been a beta release for this, because of the work that still needs to be done. 

I'm currently running this on a system that's a good 5 years old. GeForce 960 and 8GRAM. I can only run it in lowest settings because otherwise it continuously crashes. I've seen people complain about memory dump problems, so maybe that's what's happening to me. I don't know, because there's no crash report to explain why the game closed. I've even had my first blue screen of death while playing (first since right after Windows 10 released). 

That said, I would still recommend the game. There are some of the newer systems that things run smoothly on, and I imagine it's only a matter of time before the bugs get hammered out. I've seen people say this is another Anthem, but I would argue that this is so much more (well, except for IronMan, he's totally a Ranger). In a good way. 

The combo systems are smooth, and once you get used to the dodge/block/counter system, you can really feel like you're smashing the hell out of the hoards of robots. But at first it can be a bit rough, the easy mode still doesn't feel like easy mode and I'm thinking hard mode will make me cry, so I'll hold off on that. 

The story line is pretty amazing. Ms. Marvel is a lot of fun, with some amazing banter. I'd argue the story alone is worth it (though, a lot of people complain that it's different models than the cinematic, but whatever, the voice acting is actually really good! And I never say that about English VAs). 

I haven't made it to the endgame yet, but I'm excited about new characters being introduced. I can't wait to see Scarlet Witch or Quicksilver. 

The combat system reminds me of warframe and anthem, though warframe is far more smooth, and anthem is far more ... anthem. There's a lot of skills that have multiple options to change your loadout and playstyle, but you can unlock everything by maxing out the character levels. It kind of reminds me of SWTOR's skill choices or GuildWars2, but with the option to freely change up your skills as you want.  

Of the starting six, I thought BlackWidow felt the weakest until I learned how to effectively use her dodge/counter combat styles and I would argue in the hands of a skilled player, she's possibly the strongest of them all. All of the characters play differently, and when played right, they're all powerhouses (Cap is possibly one of the most fun fighters, but I love Thor and Hulk all the same)

My only real complaint stems from the gear pickups. It's like a looter-shooter in that regard, but no external changes as a result, which feels more like Anthem mods. I'm hoping they'll change the loot system down the road and put in more vanity options as a result of endgame loot. 

The money market aspect is cosmetic, and a lot of that you can get simply by leveling the characters and clearing their hero cards. Some costumes are pretty pricey, but I think that once they get their money back from the game, they'll start pushing more content and better items for $$ -- though I fear they'll make new characters cost...

Even with the bugs and the rough start, I'll still push for this one. It's a lot of fun, so much so that I'm willing to forgive the crashing.",1599935191,1599935191,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198044668738,48,3,19812,6467,5566,1601999856

This is my full review of the game. It's one of the longest I've done. So, it's a little in-depth. For those that just want a general opinion on the game, here are the last couple paragraphs of the review.

Marvel’s Avengers is a live service title through and through. It feels very shallow and tries to do way too many different things that it isn’t particularly great at any of them. The campaign feels like an excuse to get you to play the multiplayer. The combat, while fun at times, is very unbalanced. Both in singleplayer and multiplayer settings to various degrees. And it relies on very cheap-feeling design in order to overwhelm players. Missions and locales are very repetitive and start to get old rather fast. The gear system doesn’t really have a lot of depth to it. At least not any depth that really matters. And overall, the game is just very grindy and currently has little worthwhile content to really grind for.

If you’re at all into Marvel and its IPs, this game might give you a couple hours of enjoyment. The game at least has the decency to respect who these characters are. That’s something to be appreciated, especially in a time where IPs are often being handled by people who don’t understand or don’t respect the IP they’re adapting. But if you’re someone who’s looking for a competent action game, RPG experience or multiplayer experience, don’t even bother with this game. Either way, no matter what type of experience you’re looking for, I do not think Marvel’s Avengers is worth your time or money.",1599933492,1599933492,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198153129397,12,2,15691,1999,7770,1601587683

Glitches I've experienced so far: 
   * About 1/15 maps that are loaded, the game just crashes. 
   * Periodically, mid-fight, your character just won't receive any commands you give.
   * After defeating a boss, you can't go pick up the loot ... even though it's a loot-based game LOL (so frustrating)

Multiplayer is a complete mess right now.

The matchmaking doesn't work properly, I rarely get more than 1 person in my Strike Team and that's when I actually am able to find a match.

When I do find a match it either : 

A) Crashes randomly by dropping me to the desktop.

B) Drops to a black screen when I finish a mission and never ends, I can hear the characters running around, I can activate abilities but it never finishes. 

C) Bugs out because a random player joined in the middle of the mission and has problems himself loading. I see the player's name but he just stands there not doing anything.

D) Some NPC's get stuck below the map or in a wall, this prevents the mission from progressing and I have to restart the whole thing.

For the crash issues, yes I updated all my drivers, yes I changed my display settings from everything to ULTRA to LOW, yes I closed all other programs to maximise RAM usage...

The bugs happen a LOT during a 2-3 hour session, a lot more than expected from a fully released game.

94,75850239,english,"TL;DR: Lots of potential, but too many bugs.  Do not recommend for that reason plus the exorbitant base game cost plus the excessively-priced RMT cosmetics.

I cannot get past the numerous Crash To Desktop (CTD) issues.  They are random, with no readily apparent reason/cause.   These CTD are a massive frustration at any time, especially when playing multi-player with friends.  Since you cannot join someone's game in progress, you have to either finish without them or restart from the Quinjet so they can rejoin.  Why is rejoining a multi-player game not possible here, when it is smoothly accomplished in other games?  The CTD can occur within a minute of starting a new mission, or when on the final boss fight.  Either way you do not get credit for mission completion.  It does appear to save any loot obtained prior to the CTD though.  The CTD would make more sense if our computers had problems running other games, but my rig and my friends rigs are routinely used for a wide variety of games *with no problems*.  I keep seeing youtube videos where the content creator says there was a patch today, but this must only be for P$4/Xbone users.  PC has not had an update since 4-Sept (8 days ago, launch day).

My final thought is about the abilities of the superheroes with respect to locked chests and doors.  Specifically, why can't Captain America break down a door?  He _is_ able to bust out grates and even glass floors, but he's too weak to bash down a door?  Give me a break.  If you're running solo with Captain America then at the very least one of the AI companions should be able to do this.  But, no, the AI companions are unable to be commanded.  It doesn't feel very heroic to be unable to unlock or break down doors.

11,75845873,english,"The best way to describe this game is a good story, with awful gamplay. As a game I simply cannot recommend it.

The story is a run of the mill superhero story, but it has some great moments. The main character is compelling and the rest of the cast is fairly true to the comics, as well as fun to listen to while they bicker and talk. 

It's where the gamplay is concerned that this game starts falling apart. There are a lot of different enemies in the game, but most of these are either Ranged mobs, Flying mobs or Mellemobs with ranged abilities. As a result it extremely easy to get overwelmed by ranged enemies that simply stunlock you while you hopelessly mash the dodge button. Many of the game's projectiles have extreme tracking and will hit you even if you perform a ""Perfect Dodge"" some charcters as unplayable as a consequence (mostly widow and hulk fall by the wayside). 

When it comes to abilities, the different heroes are mostly well made with perhaps the exception of hulk who feels awkward to use to the point wehre I'd recommend the old PS2 game over this version. The itemization is INCREDEBLY lazy and was clearly forced in by Square enix to milk MTX. The endgame missions are incredebly lazy and not worth playing and tons of other stuff was put in just to pad the playtime with shitty loot treadmills and terrible daily quests. The feel of the abilities is great though to the point where I'd tell the Anthem devs to simply copy Ironman from this game and give him better itemization, and you would have a better game than this one. Sound and visual design are great from thors hammer clunking and zooming around to Ironman's Unibeam. The skins are mostly lackluster and not worth the trouble. 

The AI in this game is also terrible there were many cases where allied AI would clump up inside a shield forcing me to rescue them from their own stupidity. Flying enmies will clip through walls and shoot though them at you. There were many times enemies propmtly forget about me and run away while I was hitting them in the back. Friendly AI will always ignore ranged forcing you to deal with them, forcing you to fly around killing ranged while the AI fights the actually interesting enemies. Tutorials for the characters are often locked in seperate missions that are easy to overlook and can only be accessed after the first mission with them. caisng you to fumble around in the dark with your abilities or read massive walls of text while the game is paused. Most character tutorials will start with the perfect evade which you learn in the very first mission so it feels redundant every time. Some characters can block, but everyone can parry. For some reason this is locked at the start of their talent tree for some while for others it is automaticly unlocked.

This is where we get to the instability issues. It's bad, but not as bad as the console versions for me. I managed to avoid the plethora of visual glitches and bugs that most experience, but enemies phasing through walls nad crashes were common experiences. FPS was stable however, but that might not be the same on older and/or slower systems.

Square Enix support were useless: they advised me loading an old save game. They have 5 backup save files and the game saves pretty much every time you go to a different part of the game's menus. If their next response is ""restart the game""... then Marvel's Avengers is getting deleted. Yes... I got 76.8 hours out of it and I was loving the game up until this point. However, this is being sold as a ""live service"" game, and if I can't proceed through the mission chains, then I cannot get to new content when it drops in the future.

EDIT: 29.1 hours in and main campaign completed. It was brilliant!!! Not regretting the purchase at all.

EDIT: 24.6 hours in and still loving it. I am only playing single player... I wonder if those leaving negative reviews are trying to play multiplayer. I have had 1 crash to desktop in 24.6 hours: better if there were zero, but I hardly call it ""being full of bugs"".

Other issues include unbalanced gameplay, enemies being able to stun lock you, enemies doing a ton of damage regardless of difficulty (allegedly things get easier as your power level increases haven't gotten that far due to technical issues). Hulk is affected the most by this. He can get stun locked by smaller and weaker enemies which doesn't make sense.

Personal issues and bugs I've encountered besides the ones mentioned above are the daily/weekly progress not updating, outfits not unlocking, random freezes during cutscenes, and others I can't remember right now.

The story is boring and cliche, combat is super repetitive, heroes don't feel powerful enough, loot system seems unnecessary, games feels unfinished in a lot of aspects, has grind for the sake of grind.

From enemies becoming stuck in walls and your own character sharing that same fate. Do not want to forget about all of the crashes and ""HUGE"" frame rate issues that plague this game, I do not know why this games has to use up 70-80% of my memory when it runs. I have 16 GB of ram and I have a 2070 super GPU, it should not be drawing so much to run this.

People would say that they are being forced by their investors to release these games early, truth, but they fail to see that their biggest investors are us, the consumers.

This game is amazing. If you're a fan of the MCU at all you will love the story. Its a great and touching story of what it means to be a hero. Kamala Khan's growth through the entire story was immense, and the supporting characters around her, meaning the rest of the Avengers were phenomenal. Her father was the heart of the whole thing.

As for the gameplay, the combat is the best part by far. Each character has many different combos and abilities they can use to beat down some AIM baddies. You can even focus on ranged damage if you want, even on Hulk.

Hulk, Rage Monster - Feels like the Hulk! While he may seem weak at first, wait until you unlock some of his bigger hits. Smashing the ground. Picking up AIM Robots and swinging them around like makeshift weapons. Slamming them together to create shockwaves. The possibilities...

Thor, God of Thunder(Hammers) - They nailed Thor's gameplay so well. Throwing Mjolnir never felt better. Throw it. Leave it there. Punch some bad guys. Call it back, slam that hammer down, twirl it and off you go in the air to GOD BLAST the enemies from the sky, just to summon the Bifrost and destroy everything around it. Wearing your mothers drapes never felt better!

Ironman, Billionaire, Playboy, Philanthropist  - Repulsors. Lasers. Rockets. Fly and shoot. Land and shoot. Hover and shoot. Punch them all day long. Sticky rockets? You got it. Laser sweeps? You got it. All in all, it feels like Ironman. The only thing they could do is give him a tiny bit more speed. But you -can- unlock a speed boost!

Captain America, Super Soldier - Shield throws for days. You want to bounce that shield off some people and kick it back and forth like a ping pong ball? HELL YES YOU DO. Wall run, double jump, somersault, and never skip leg day again. Also, that is definitely America's Ass!

Black Widow, Super Spy - You want stealth? YOU GOT IT. You want batons? YOU GOT THEM TOO. Did I mention guns? Pistols, Sub Machine Guns, High Caliber Shots, you got it all. Want to combo in style? You pick Natasha for the style. Zip lines and all that fun stuff is built into her kit. 10/10 would nonchalantly be the backbone of the team again.

Ms. Marvel, Avengers Fanatic - You want to stretch? How about punch that guy over there, from here? WELL NOW YOU CAN. Move aside Garen, the queen of SPIN TO WIN is here. Stretch and kick your way to victory and squeeze the life from your enemies as adorable Kamala Khan, whose sheer fandom helped her save the world. 


With a Destiny-like system of gearing, but more interesting perks and abilities, this game literally has staying power. The main critique I have is pricing on Marketplace stuff is expensive, however, they literally SHOWER YOU in free costumes just by playing the game. In the time I've played I've found about 10 PER CHARACTER.


All in all, as a massive Marvel fan, this game is a solid 9/10.

65,75829100,english,"HERE'S WHAT I THINK ABOUT THE GAME SO FAR.
There's a lot to say about this game. But I'll try not to make it too long. 
Even though I have about a mid point, in-between the games requirements, it still runs slow/laggy a lot of the time. But it's still at a good amount where I like playing it. It's only crashed once while I've played, and it's froze one other time. Overall, I like the gameplay, and I think it's fun. But it can get quite annoying with the fact that it's sloppy kind of a lot, but it's still manageable, as long as you have the right settings. And from my experience, and messing with the settings a lot, to see what I like and what works best, I've been able to have an overall decent experience with this game. If I'm gonna be honest, I did get kinda addicted when playing. Though, I have only played the game, 2 times total, so far. Because I just recently got it.

BUGS.
There are still some obvious bugs in the game. There will be times when I will see all the pixels on the screen become all rainbow-ey, and recently this thing started happening where the pixels at the bottom of the screen would start turning black and white, but that one isn't that bad. One way I found to fix the discolored pixels when they become all rainbow-ey, is to just simply, go to your display/graphic settings, and change the resolution, then change it back, and it should be fixed. There are other bugs in the game too, but I'm not quite sure how to explain all of them, and I can't really think of all of them, off the top of my head.

WHAT I RECOMMEND.
I recommend, that if the game doesn't run very well, or it's sloppy/slow, to set almost everything to the lowest settings, that's how I currently play the game. And if needed, you can lower the resolution to help it too. And while it's still kinda slow, it runs and plays alot better than if you didn't do that. Even if you do lower the settings, it doesn't look that bad.

WOULD I RECOMMEND THE GAME?
My experience with this game hasn't been ""bad"". But there are Definitely things that the devs could fix to make it better, which includes just making it run better overall. I still have more of the game to play, and I plan on completing the game. But if I were to recommend the game in it's current state, I would say, if you're a fan of Marvel, and Avengers and all that, and you think you can handle the bugs, maybe a 7 or 8 out of 10. But if you're not a big fan of Marvel, then maybe a 6 or 7 out of 10. And if you really don't like the bugs and stuff, and you can't handle them, and you're not a big fan of Marvel, then maybe a 4 or 5 out of 10.

FINAL THOUGHTS.
This is just my opinion though. If you think you can handle it, and you wanna try out the game, then go for it. But in it's current state, you might wanna wait for a bit of a price drop, since it is expensive, for how kinda buggy it is. It might be good to check out some videos too, and see what others say, before you buy it. I'm not trying to hate on the game, I like it, But I'm just saying my opinion.

70,75828756,english,"Bought it, thought let me give it a try since I'm a whale anyway.

Instant FPS loss, especially during cut scenes, this is what is referred to as a memory leak. I can confirm that relaunching the game can fix it, but I don't want to have to do that everytime. I'm sure at least one person will say, ""Well cmon they'll fix it"". I'm sure they will, but this among other claimed issues just doesnt seem worth it. 

Just wait for the game to go down in price or until the reviews show that they are bringing this game back up. Just remember it's a service game and that if they don't sell well they will minimize the team and that will cause delays in new events and heroes. To make matters worse the next hero is Kate Bishop instead of huge staples like Black Panther, Antman, or Spider-man.

If you're a mega Marvel fan then I'm sure you'll love this game despite it's huge flaws, I'm big on DC and if this was swapped for DC characters I'd play it regardless of its shittier aspects, but if you're sensible and not a huge fan of this stuff then dont buy it.

I'm going to wait a bit and just see if the game bounces back or if the company makes a statement on this disappointing mess, but I will not play it any longer than I have already so I can still refund.

If you want to give it a try go for it, just remember Steams refund policy, ""You can refund a game purchased on Steam if you request the refund within two weeks of purchase, and have played the game for less than two hours total. When your game is refunded, it will be removed from your Steam library, and you'll receive the full value of your purchase back.""

   Multiplayer is great because you can choose how you want to play. If you just want chill gameplay and to talk with your homies put it on normal and just go in and button mash. If you want something where you have to strategize more and learn how to build and use all your abilities correctly you can put it on brutal and get more serious gameplay out of it.

On a decent computer, the graphics are spectacular, with almost psychotic levels of detail of skin and even clutter (for example the home base is strewn with even litter that seems very realistic down to life-like dust) Having said that, the game suffers from cheap enemy AI that can cut down your ""willpower"" (since Square Enix is apparently afraid to say HEALTH) very quickly for one or two hits unless you are absolutely perfect on your dodging, making it feel more like a Dark Souls game in some parts than a typical action brawler.  Speaking of Dark Souls, the game is almost needlessly looty.  That same loot mechanic that has invaded so many other games in the past 10 years is back again, in a fashion that really removes a player from the narrative.  (""We need to go after these supervillians Kamala!""  ""No, wait!  I need to get this blue armband to upgrade from my green one!"")  Frankly I'm not interested in the multiplayer although that is supposed to be a major draw.

So in this state I can't recommend unless you're a die-hard Marvel fan. It's very glitchy, so far i've experienced getting pushed out of the map and having to restart from checkpoint, bugs where my team loads into matches but I don't and I have to quit to desktop and restart the game, graphical glitches, big frame-rate drops, AI getting completely stuck(fixed by letting ai teammate go down and then picking them back up), among some others. That is all in my first 8 hours of online play(haven't touched the story mode). I'm pretty disappointed gear doesn't change your appearance at all too, that's a massive part of most looter games especially being a 3rd person game where you're always looking at your own character. I think the devs dropped the ball hard with that design choice but I know they did say they wanted to keep it true to the Marvel universe as they didn't think it would be right ""having Thor fly around with a pink hammer"" but they could have made unique visible gear without allowing for things like pink hammers or whatever. To me that just feels like they were trying to save a buck. There isn't a lot of level variety and some entire levels are just reused sections of other longer levels(levels take anywhere from 3-30 minutes). Oh and the spider-man deal is absolute BS, your player base should NEVER be punished simply for playing on their system of choice. I was aware before I bought this, but i'll put it out there that even though its an 80$ AAA title they have macrotransactions(stop calling them mirco), for cosmetics and their character specific battlepasses(which take ages to complete as there are only 4 challanges a day you can complete to progress a battlepass which offer a very small amount of battlepass xp). Other than all of that, the game is pretty fun, characters do feel different and combat is engaging though as many have pointed out it does feel like it will get old pretty fast. Having said all that if you love Avengers and Marvel you will have some fun playing this but if you're not a huge fan i'd probably save your money or wait for a deep sale. 

The last thing i'll say is this is an early-access title(games as a service are better described as early-access) and if you waited a year or so for this to get to where it should be then I think it could be an excellent game. But in this state it should be around 50$, especially because you're essentially putting your money on the line to fund the development of an incomplete early-access title. 

In this state i'd give this game a 6.5/10

*Edit*
So after playing through the story mode I have a bit more good to say about this game. Everything I said for multiplayer still stands for now but the story mode is way better! I did experience a few bugs here and there but not nearly as many as in multiplayer. The story isn't gunna blow you away but it's great fun regardless. The missions are designed well enough and are fairly varied. The writing as well as the voice acting are pretty good. Hopefully they can get the kinks sorted soon with the rest of the game!

I like taking on hordes of enemies as an Avenger, however I guess it can get a bit repetitive. I really have not run into this issue as I've only played for six hours.

I cannot recommend this game until there is an patch for this issue. All I can really say is it's a really cool simulation of being an Avenger but I'm super weak because I can't upgrade my skills or equipment. I want to like this game but I cannot in good conscience until this game figures its shit out.  Again the gameplay so far for me has been super cool besides the issue I'm having.  Really I just want to find a way to correct this issue and this is the only platform I can think of.  I'm running this on an rtx 2070 super so I don't think the graphics settings are an issue but maybe as I'm not a PC expert. Any ways I truly hope if you buy this game you don't run into this issue and for what its worth I would rate this a 6.5 - 7 / 10 as far as gameplay and experience. Just be warned that it has this issue.

Anyway I figured out that the game was trying to get me to upgrade the equipment and I am stupid because it took me more than 3 days to figure out so the game works for me now.

As much as I knew it would be a Anthem themed recycle in genre and knowing i was buying into a mindless grind of re running the same map over and over again to wait for a endgame that isn't even currently out, I was not gonna be mad about it...

BUT the amount of game breaking bugs and if you care, Immersion breaking bugs is unreal. The classic AAA game bait and hook that chages out the wazzoo to be a glorified beta tester is getting worse each release.

Bugs consist of:
floating environment disturbs
characters T posing
falling through the floor
characters popping vanish only to have the weapons floating 
the chimera literally losing its textures like its a snake shredding its skin
input legit don't work (As a mouse and keyboard masochist)
getting hit through terrain

How is this acceptable to be released its a actual joke, even with the repetitive gameplay which I actually was ok with because im a marvel fanboy ngl, I couldn't enjoy it. Re-running a 30 minute boss fight to die to falling or getting stuck in the floor or building is omega tilting.

 - I liked the story line, I did really feel sucked in at times. 
 - Voice acting sounded good to me

Cons
 - This game has potential, but as is, it's very klunky with movement between flying, and running. 
 - Level design was just lazy. Everything was just copy/pasted. How can you release with this bad of design and feel proud?
 - There is no item design when you equip the item?
 - The RPG element to this game with the skill tree leaves me wanting better skill unlocks. 
 - Game is too expensive for something that is clearly still in Alpha.
 - Limited free roam with levels that are extremely linear.

The problems I have with the game is that it is ""on rails"" too much, which is o.k. for the story, but not so much for gameplay.  You just start to get used to a hero, then you have to switch to a different one. I took what seemed like forever to unlock Thor, which was the hero I really wanted to play, and then the next mission had me playing another hero. WTF?

This game would have been 1000% better if you could play a hero all the way through the story, then play again with another hero from that second hero's perspective. That would have not only let you get used to a hero's play style, but it would have made it much more re-playable. It also would have cost them a lot more to make, and taken more time, but then this is supposed to be a AAA title, right?

I get the impression that the ""campaign"" was only made to introduce you to the game so you want to play the multiplayer, which I will never play. I'm not even sure I'll finish the campaign. Maybe when I'm done playing Assassin's Creed: Odyssey for the 4th time, or Horizon Zero Dawn for PC again.

Me: breaks gamepad, because there is NO WAY TO LOAD YOUR MISSION PROGRESS.

That game is a filthy experiment with desire to earn money with marvel's franchise. 

1. No gameplay variety. All physics are the same for all characters.
2. No depth at all. 
3. No stealth gameplay for Natasha Romanoff.
4. Unbalansed missions: You can easily complete some missions on BRUTAL difficulty and then easily die on EASY one.
5. Tons of USELESS loot.
6. Slow UI. That frustrating when you have to open UI 10 times per mission just to equip useless +1-2% items on your character.
7. No autosaves for mission progress. If your game crashes or you just had to leave - you need to start mission again.

Yes the game does have its issues, which i will cover but overall if you can look past those issues its really enjoyable. 
[h1]STORY[/h1]
The games story was honestly really fun and enjoyable for me as a whole. The story they decided to go with was really original, and was paced fairly well. The mix between combat and story telling was a lot better than i would have thought. Not getting into any spoilers but there was a few cool moments that made me go ""No way"" or ""OH MY GOD THIS IS AWESOME"". As a fan of the Avengers there were a few Easter eggs that really made me happy and excited to play. The voice acting was really good and overall gameplay was good. Not great, but good. Playing through the story though you will realize that it barley scratches the surface on character progression which is where the multiplayer comes in.

[h1]MULTIPLAYER[/h1]
After completing the Story mode you can start with the multiplayer mode. This to me is where i have the most fun. I'm gonna address the repetitiveness. Yes the multiplayer is VERY repetitive. All the missions feel almost the same, and very alike, which for most players this will get really old really fast. Personally I really enjoy it despite that. Another issues it has that should be fixed with some upcoming patches is the glitches. [b]THERE IS ALOT[/b]. Anywhere from the sound cutting out, to falling through the map, enemys not finding you, to them just flat out not spawning.  They dont happen all the time but when they do it gets really annoying. The game for me at least has somewhat of a crashing issue but it isnt to bad. The best part about the multiplayer part is the leveling up and gear system. Its somewhat compared to a Destiny type system but different in its own way. Also being able to play as each hero and level them up adds a little to it. IF they were to add more mission types and more to do i think it would be really solid.

There's a lot of potential here, and it's why I gave it a shot. Thor plays like he should when the combat isn't freaking out, Cap has pretty much every move you could want and more, the characters are written... alright, and I got a kick out of seeing from Kamala's PoV as a fellow Marvel fan. But potential doesn't mean much if it's not realized.

It has a ton of bugs, performance is weird af (in one part of the Chimera I can get 144 fps locked, but if I look at a wall that seemingly has [i] less [/i] going on I drop to 80), draw distance is AWFUL, some textures look great and others look like they're from the 360 era, the voice acting is okay but considering the actors themselves are fantastic, means the voice direction probably wasn't the greatest.

32,75780946,english,"This game has problems. Let's get that straight.

- Bugs
Just visit the /r/PlayAvengers subreddit. They have a big ole list going, and it's embarassing stuff that they should have hammered out before release. Why have a Community Challenge if the bar doesn't even update for everyone? I got a nameplate today, so I guess we beat it, but I'm not even sure. Wall climbing is buggy at the best of times; a lot of platform-y locations are more about fighting the game into letting you grab a ledge instead of grabbing the wall, or simply jump up the wall instead of away. That's when jumping onto the ledge doesnt' leave you stuck in place for ten seconds. 

- Graphic Bugs
Dear. God. This is where it is clear that the game did not get a polish pass, let alone the months it needed to get these graphics under control. My base has popped in around me multiple times when I started a campaign mission from the War Table. Characters are ""speaking"" during a cutscene but their mouths don't move. Tony Stark pulls his super cool suit from the wall, and the game keeps pushing it despite the cutscene starting -- so he's pushed into the wall, and Kamala sits their confused and stuttering until Tony pops back in from the Netherworld. These types of graphical mishaps aren't rare. They're commonplace. 

- Gameplay
This is why I'm still recommending the game. If you can past the jank graphics (seriously, this is nearly Eastern European Jank levels of jank we're talking about here), the gameplay itself is fun. The Hulk is satisfying once you get some healing skills specced (the ""slamming grabbed opponents into the ground distributes healing packs"" perk in particular actually rewards you for playing like the Hulk). Ms Marvel was a miss for me, but that's because I like the more solid play from Hulk, Cap, and Thor. 

If you like to fly around, just ignore Iron Man. His flying is outright awful. He is SO floaty and unresponsive that it's a shame. Ugh. So awful. 

- Story
Nothing here is going to surprise you. The twist(s) are obvious, but they're not trying to be tricky. The ""Our strength is our diversity"" meme is so blatant that Ms. Marvel actually says exactly that. Nothing here is subtle, but it's exactly the level of writing you'd expect from a superhero comic/cartoon. Nothing is implied, nothing is left for you to decide or ferret out. Ms. Marvel is even gatekept at the A-Day ceremony by a petulant white teenager because she's ""not even a real fan,"" before she WTFBBQLOL's him with a quote and a ""You'd know that if you were a real fan.""

If you can handle story telling that is so bad that it's accidentally preachy (as it only feels preachy when their bad writing forces them to be blatantly obvious with their morality), and graphical bugs that are straight outrageous from a AAA game, then I'd pick it up. There's plenty to do here, and there's a promising base for them to add to down the road.",1599802401,1599802401,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198058078274,877,7,2367,20,1650,1600969519

Enemy attack indicators are bad, superhuman reaction times required for some enemy moves, unblockables galore, enemies seemingly blocking moves that are supposed to be block breaks, the wind blowing could probably stagger you while the literal god of thunder can't stagger an elite with a cosmic weapon. 3 shots are common and that's not even counting modifiers yet. In the end, you'd probably be able to hit 2-3 times before needing to dodge/parry... so much for that fun combo system.

I saw someone in the official Discord say that the pirated version of the game works and indeed it does for some reason, but I can't play the copy I paid for.

47,75778379,english,"Short Review: Story is good but short, the gameplay is fun but lacks any real depth, the multiplayer is fun but also lacks depth, the progression is ruined by confusion system and has a lot of Microtransaction. 5/10

Story: I won't Spoiler anything but the story is full of kidish joy and wonder until the midway point of the story when The Avengers realize they have a conflict to solve. It has it's moments but all in all it disappoints with only two villains and 3 bosses. 

Gameplay: Every character in this game has a verity of moves abilities and skills they can use during combat although it usually boils down to spamming light then heavy attacks while you wait for your abilities to recharge. Which every character has 3 of, some are really cool and some I never use outside of the challenges. It's a jack of all traits situation where gave there's 6 hero's but they all feel the same. The worst part is the health system you got (what feels like) small amounts of health and to regain lost heath you go to these green barrels or they can drop from defeated enemies. I feel like this was a missed opportunity. They should have had a healer type class that can drop health pick ups to support the team. The game lacks depth and strategy.

Multiplayer: This is the most lukewarm part of this game. Due to the short story mode the multiplayer is where you will spend most of your time and it's not great. Mission band together as maps and levels are reused either from the story or from other multiplayer mission which makes the bland gameplay stick out like a sore thumb. It's fine enough to keep you going but after 30 hours I'm already drained, I'm hopeful they will add more missions but they need to add more enemy factions AIM just isn't doing it. Loot is the main goal of the multiplayer which like everything else falls flat. They have traits and perk, but because you can't see it on your character there's a massive disconnect . There's no reason to chase the cool legendary if you can't see it on your character. What you can see on your character is the many skins. I'm happy they have a lot but there's a lot missing. Which the multiple battle that can be grinded to either net you more skins or currency some in-game and some premium that you can use to buy skins that come off and on the stores weekly and daily. It ruins the progression of the game as skins are the only way to express yourself through your characters looks. Yes you can get redeemable skins and cosmetics through missions and seemingly random drops but as of now that system is glitch to the point you get nothing when you redeem skins and some players have reported skins can disappear from you inventory. You simple don't get enough of the currencies to get everything and if you don't pay you will grind challenges some daily, some weekly to level up your battlepass which turns Avengers into a job instead of a game. I feel like the term ""Pay To Play"" fits here.

Overall: Fun game without a soul or identity that is ruined by a lot of glitches, Bland gameplay, meaningless loot and microtransactions but it can still be saved by a massive overhaul. It reminds me of OG Destiny. A week after launch it's still broken so I'm not sure it will last.

53,75776779,english,"If you like the avengers movies and/or beat em up games you should play Marvel's Avengers. A lot of this game is advertised and geared towards the endgame which is the avengers post campaign multiplayer. If you are not a fan of this type of multiplayer that's still ok, you don't have to play it. 

You can buy this game and play the campaign, side missions, objectives and level up your heroes for dozens of hours all without touching the multiplayer. The campaign is fairly short with an ok story and the dialogue is sometimes cheesy. There are plenty of cosmetics, powerful gear, resources, cosmetics and xp you will earn along the way.

A big downside in missions is you cannot switch heroes during the mission. If you choose Thor for a war zone mission, you're stuck as him until it's completed. 

Now if you are someone that is interested in Destiny 2 type bounties and objectives with up to 3 other friends, I would suggest not waiting until this product goes on sale. Buy it now while the player base is high. The price is high too but there's nothing worse than a multiplayer game with no players.



There's a lot of fun missions and gameplay to experience right now and a lot to look forward to later. With that said the game feels like it doesn't know who it is. The heroes are too closely similar to their movie counterparts that they feel similar but too different at the same time. the gameplay can also get repetitive and the button mashing might get old for some.

57,75777707,english,"Avengers, whats there to say.

The single player campaign sits at around 15 hours long and in my playtime it played perfectly, this IS NOT the MCU avengers.

Graphics are great and if you have all the bells and whistles applied it looks fucking fantastic, but that is also the games biggest flaw.
It runs like a turd being rolled uphill, this game was not ready for release.

At the time of writing there is a massive memory leak, and a terrible amount of CTD going on with no real error messages other than what you find in the logs (which all point to massive memory leak).
This seems to effect some maps more than others and quite often i can go hours with no issue, then the one map i want to play just errors out every......single......time.

Once they patch the game it will actually be good, the gameplay loop is a lot of fun and the characters all fight in different ways, i hate captain america's playstyle but ive seen people destroy with him, personally prefer thor.
It is live service so its being added to and worked on though in the beginning there is a LOT of content, expect to see rre used assets left right and centre.
Other than the current technical issues the only real complaint is the first ffew patches did little to address them and focused more on fixing cosmetic crap no one will buy while the game is in its current state.

If you can look past the technical problems (there are multiple reported i've never seen) and love the good old loot grind i would recommend picking it up, but i would also say give it a little time to get itself stable.

PROS

-Combat is way more in depth than what the opening sequence or the Beta offered, one of the better skill trees I've ever seen in a game, with rewarding and dynamic choices that can be adjusted even after you've maxed out the tree

-Each character really feels unique, especially when you really start to unlock more skills/moves making it fun to try different characters on different missions

-lots of fun challenges and dailies to make it worth checking in every day to unlock new stuff and get more gear/cosmetics and level up your characters.

-Some (if not all) of the best skins can be unlocked without paying a dime, either via the story or the hero cards, don't believe all of the BS that this is a cash grab, I will be curious to see how future content is handled but as of right now, there is no need to spend any money in this game unless you are impatient

- Apart from the Hulk , no Avenger feels nerfed or limited, Thor is a beast, Iron Man has every flippin power/gadget we see in the movies and comic books and its so awesome that we can just zip up into the sky whenever we want, no ""overheating"" or flight meter making you feel limited.

-BEST FOR LAST: playing online with a friend is where this game absolutely shines! So much fun teaming up with someone else and just tearing through a squad of AIM soldiers or bots, so cool to see how different heroes synergize with one another. 


CONS

-BUGS...this game has some problems, it shouldn't have been released in the state its in, is it playable? totally, most bugs are extremely minor and don't hinder the enjoyment of the game, having said that...there are some that are a big problem : hard crashes, matchmaking issues, consumable rewards literally resulting in 0 rewards due to a glitch. 

-Areas/Level design is very copy and paste, there are about 4 different environments in the game and they all pretty much feel and look the same, I'm sure this will change with future updates, but for now it is a bit of a bummer. 

-in bigger fights it can be a bit chaotic, so much happening on the screen you really can't react or really do anything other than try to get away before dying because of enemies spamming attacks.

-Not a whole lot of info is given to you to explain what certain items are or what they do, what certain missions are, the daily challenges sometimes ask you to do things that you have ever heard of so I have ended up googling certain terms to find wikis explaining the difference between a heroic attack, heroic finisher, heroic special?!?! 


I'm happy with my purchase, I think this game has some serious potential to be an amazing game, right now its a good game, I hope people give it a chance and that the developers use that success to drive the quality of the future content. I'd hate to see this game fail because of misinformation and people crying ""Anthem!"" which results in people avoiding this and it being seen as a failure....because I have played both...and this is NOT Anthem.

Overall it is a solid game and i would rate it like a 7/10

The first thing, and this is a big one for me... is how good the game looks. Like, I was blown away, i thought i had seen some good looking games before, but my gosh did this game blow them all out of the water. If you're in it for the visuals, this game will not dissapoint. 

I really like the gameplay, i think it is fast paced and a lot of fun, but at times the game is just Unfair to artificially increase the difficulty. IT follows the "" Light attack combo, heavy attack combo and Dodge"" formula, so if you like that then you will probably like this.

In my opinion the story was pretty meh... I didn't dislike it, I'm just not a big Marvel fan so it didn't really speak to me.

The campaign took me 12 hours to get through, which i think was just the right length.

After the campaign they want you to play in this weird multiplayer mode, idk i tried it and i'm not a huge fan, its pretty repetitive and doesn't really add much to the game. PRobably great with friends, but as a solo player it just feels like a let down. I think the ""endgame"" is meant to be a reputation grind and that's about it, just re-using the campaign maps with different objectives.

72,75775216,english,"Wow, this game is well made! I just finished the campaign and haven’t had a chance to dive into the online content yet but, I’ve played enough of the game to write this review. I honestly don’t understand why people were hating on this game saying the endgame was loot based and gets repetitive and the gameplay looked clunky. If you're a fan of The Avengers I think this is by far one of the best games you could ask for. I honestly don’t get the general hatred as I came to enjoy the character models over time as well as the gameplay. Another criticism I heard about the game before it came out was the gameplay looked too simplistic and easy which, yes in the opening screen sequence that we saw on the Golden Gate Bridge, the gameplay does start out pretty simplistic. However, if you give the game a chance and really pick a hero to master you’ll realize that like any good action game, especially any good superhero game that takes a fan favorite comic book IP like this and tries to make a good video game out of it should do. It evolves over time and gets more challenging as it throws some other enemy types into the mix that I won’t spoil. It’s most definitely a fantastic experience based on the single player campaign mode only that’s worthy of The Avengers IP. A few cons to this game I think I could possibly give is that the combat is nowhere near as complex as say, the Batman Arkham series or Spider-Man games but it still has a lot of depth to its gameplay that is more than likely you won’t get to experience if you don’t buy the game and try it out for yourself. If you’re a fan of the Avengers and want a great game that will make you feel like your favorite characters on the team then most certainly pick this one up.

75,75628229,english,"This game is by no means perfect, but it's a lot of fun. If you're a Marvel fan, love looters, and have a group of friends pick this game up!

The campaign runs around 10-ish hours, pretty short for a campaign but here that is just the introduction to this game. A fun engaging introduction to the game making me excited for what's to come of this game into the future.

After you complete the main campaign is where you get into the meat. You get into the real grind. If that doesn't sound like fun to you then this game may not be FOR YOU. There are multiple different mission types. Securing sections, helping people, destroying bases, and even big bad villain sectors. To be honest, they all typically feel very similar. The gameplay is very fun but if you get bored by grinding the same mission types then once again you might want to sit this one out. Although that is to be expected if you like ""Destiny"" type games, there's only so much you can do. These missions also keep me interested by still very slowly progressing the overall story they are trying to tell with Avengers, which I really appreciate. 

As for the negative conversations this game has been stirring up frankly I don't understand it. yes, there are micro transactions. YES, they are priced astronomically high. On the other hand though, this is a games as a service type game. I want to support them. I want to support this game as they hand us TONS of characters and content along the way. On the other hand I have to be very picky if I buy ANYTHING from this in game marketplace because, like I said the prices are ridiculous. if you don't like the prices of these marketplace items then just avoid them! There are other ways to get costumes and emotes in the game other than forking out real money!

I didn't experience any major bugs while playing the story but I have encountered a handful of crashes after the story at the time of writing this review around launch.

This game is a very fun experience with friends if you like games as a service type games, or even if you're just a massive Marvel fan.

The game deserves plenty of criticism for the things that are wrong with it but I feel like the good in this game is far greater than the bad. If the developers support the game the way they've promised, I believe it can become something really special.

[hr][/hr]
[h1]Pros:[/h1]
[b] - All the playable characters feel unique.[/b] There's a uniform combat system including light/heavy attacks, parrying, and dodging but every hero has their own individual set of skills that offer a different way to play.

[b] - The skill upgrades feel impactful.[/b] Once hitting certain experience levels, you can begin to upgrade and augment hero abilities. Some can offer heals in a pinch, others may increase damage or be able to hit multiple targets. Your play style can differ from someone else playing the same hero and you can both excel and that's pretty cool.

[b] - Nothing locked behind a paywall.[/b] This should be a standard but sadly it's not in modern mainstream gaming. In this game, nothing of real value is only made available through another purchase. You can buy in-game currency for cosmetics or time skips (In battlepass-like unlock paths for more/rare cosmetics) but everything in the game is available through playing

[b] - The main campaign's story is fantastic.[/b] Kamala is the star of the story and it serves as her origin into becoming Ms. Marvel. All the characters are well written and they feel real. Kamala and Bruce Banner especially stood out to me. I dare say it compares to the midrange MCU movies or even better.

[b] - It's pretty.[/b] The world and characters are designed beautifully. It's not a Red Dead Redemption 2 or anything like that but I never once found myself thinking anything wasn't well done. The effects for all the abilities look fantastic as well.

[b] - Post-Campaign content doesn't feel pointless.[/b] The story of the campaign continues with missions and quest lines afterwards. It starts at a point that makes sense considering the story and let's you dig a little deeper into the world.

[hr][/hr]
[h1]Cons:[/h1]
[b] - Bugs. There are tons of bugs.[/b] I would crash a LOT the first couple of days (If you have issues with crashing, I suggest lowering your graphics settings to high or medium. That's what solved that issue for me.). I've gotten stuck in walls a few times. Enemies have gotten stuck in walls. Some enemies have failed to spawn which made me have to reset a checkpoint. Issues with people disconnecting mid-mission would cause multiple allies to be around you. (Not the worst thing, but not intended) Basically, it's littered with little bugs that don't necessarily hinder the experience THAT much but can absolutely frustrate you very quickly. I will say, the enjoyment I've been getting vastly outweigh any frustration I've felt due to bugs and glitches.

[b] - It can be repetitious.[/b] It's the nature of this type of game but I still feel like it's worth saying. Once you get into the post-game content and begin doing daily missions for the in-game factions, it can become somewhat tedious doing dungeon-like missions called Hives or Vaults. Beyond that, the gear systems in this game can result in you having a LOT of gear put into a ""bank"". You can salvage the gear for materials but it's not [i]nearly[/i] as convenient as I think it could be.

[b] - I've experienced a lot of frame drops/hanging.[/b] I have a solid computer and at times mid-battle, I find my game's framerate dropping considerably due to a bunch of characters, explosions, and particles all happening at once. It looks nice but it really struggles sometimes.

[b] - There's a lack of memorable villains.[/b] There are 2 major villains in the main campaign, 2 more individual character bosses, then 2 other bosses. They're written well enough in the main campaign but in general, the antagonists in the story and in missions lack depth and intrigue for me. It's fun and challenging enough fighting most of them but I really hope as they continue to add content, they introduce better story points or more interesting bosses to fight.

[b] - The main cast gets close to the uncanny valley in a way.[/b] Some of the characters we've seen in modern pop culture are great but feel a tiny bit off? I guess I can say. For example, Bruce Banner feels like he wants to be Mark Ruffalo's Bruce Banner from the MCU but doesn't quite reach that point. Thor as well if you think of the first two MCU Thor movies. As I said earlier, they're written really well but I felt like I noticed that a bit.

[hr][hr]
[h1]In Summary:[/h1]
The game is fun. It's wicked fun. It has it's problems but I can see many of the problems being fixed in patches and being amended in future content. If you're a fan of Marvel heroes because of the comics or the movies, I think you'll love this. If you like looter shooter-type games where you can grind and explore to get the best gear, I think you'll like this. I could argue it could've been $40 instead of $60 but if development and support proceed as promised, it's absolutely worth the current price tag.

96,75771324,english,"So..... I've been eagerly awaiting this game pretty much since it was announced. The moment I heard Square Enix was doing a marvel game, I knew it was gonna be something big. The game has been out for a week so far, I've gotten to play a little early because I did delux beta >.< I have 30 hours on record and have just finished the ""campaign"" on hard. So I figured it'd be a good time to review. In a nutshell, I loved it, love it, even though I'm done with the ""campaign"" I have only scratched the shit to do list. I bought this game because I was sold on a marvel payday style game. Most of what I had seen was their wartable streams showcasing the ""crime.net"" look of their multiplayer mode. I have also heard their missions/stories play alot like Destiny, but I myself have not played Destiny so I""m running with payday. HOWEVER, I have yet to really MESS with any of that.... That's right 30 hours and I've mostly been playing the campaign.... Let's be honest... who the fuck is Modok? when has this dude ever shown up besides as a tv extra in weird crossovers? Would you talk shit about him now? HELL NO. We had a 30 hour interactive narrative driven campaign that makes you LEARN each character.... at least in theory... fuck widow.... splices multiplayer missions in as you unlock your roster.... and ya know..... I don't care who you are.... try not squeeling when you get cap.  Upon beating ""the campaign"" I now have character specific arcs for each of the 6 characters, along with some shield specific plot, and hints at an Abomination centered story and a Task Master centered story, and all of THESE are specifically geared towards the multiplayer. So, I'm eager and excited.

The cons. 

So I've very specificly tried to play up to this point, without outside judgment, I've avoided critiques, streams, reviews, etc etc. Mostly cause I didn't want a bunch of nay sayers to ruin my experience.... and I'm kinda happy.  So the biggest complaints I've heard is the that the game is a cash grab. I honestly think this is confusion as to what the game actually is... We have been promised years of content, for a 60 dollar buy. We are looking at a new mmo format, with content introduced with each character release, and no extra price. We know there are at least 16 confirmed characters lined up and in the game, the last wartable stream teased that we're getting  the next 2 possibly 3 ""immediately"". This is going to ADD campaign missions centric to those characters that pushes the ""main story"", while adding new sets of every mission type into the game FOR FREE. 

Oh but how does the game make money then? Why are people saying it's a cash grab? Two reasons; Exclusives (we know) that Spiderman has been confirmed as a playstation exclusive, and that crossplay was axed for this reason.... yes I'm wounded and grouchy.... but this IS the market norm... and not a deal breaker to me... No one stopped playing soul caliber over this? Or any of the other popular fighting games that did it...The other reason is the one I was a little suspicious about. BattlePasses.... I hate battlepasses.... I straight up avoid games that use them.... but they're in here. Essentially every character has a battlepass or challenge  card, as you move up you get shit just like all the others.... But what shit? Emotes..... Costumes.... Resource packs at lvl 3, and at the end of the battlepass enough store credits to unlock another battlepass. So this spooked me.... there was no mention of this at all through development.... or in beta... they kinda posted info on it right before launch x-D But I digress. Let me talk a little bit about WHY this still hasn't scared me away..... so  you start the game with 6 battlepasses for the 6 characters you unlock in the campaign. For a 60$ game.... ah I see what you did there Square.... the 30 hours I've spent has made that well worth it, and I still haven't used up a battle pass. I'm at like stage 5 on the first 6 characters? and still have tons of content to play..... So I could spend 10 bucks to buy another battlepass? why? what would that get me? the ability to wave with extra stretchy hands! Oh wait.... I unlock that naturally by hitting level five in Kamala's battlepass anyways.... OH MR FIXIT SKIN FOR THE HULK..... oh wait.... I can get that at lvl 30 on his battle pass, or for 5k green resource thingies from that vendor..... oh hey I'm only 300 away... fuck that... Like seriously what are you guys already throwing money at here? all this shit unlocks naturally anyways? The option is there, to be used say.... When your favorite marvel character gets introduced to the game and you HAVE TO HAVE his epic golden age costume (mind you, you GET ALL THE CHARACTERS LEVELS, AND PLAYABILITY, WITHOUT THE BATTLEPASS).

2,75769820,english,I have played this game for almost 90h. I was patient.

But now I only do few dailies quest that random are available to me to get my first and last char in this game to 150.

There's/ plenty of content here. The main story is 12-15 hours if you soak it in. The missions aren't vast, but the maps and combos sure are! It plays like a next generation Ultimate Alliance which met the Arkham series. The pseudo-RPG elements are nifty too. Remnants of Destiny or Dragonball Zenoverse. 

Character models could use some work. Sometimes the faces remind me of Mass Effect Andromeda when it first came out, but it's only seldomly immersion-breaking. Sometimes the character models of your teammates will lock up in a 'T' pose during multiplayer games, too. Only aesthetics can be bought on the market place with the in-game money. It's a bit of a grind to get the cool stuff. I do wish they would have made certain finishing moves and costumes more realistic to attain. Altogether, these aspects aren't a deal breaker.

   Cinematic experience that takes a high end graphics card to truly appreciate. 
   I'm using a 2080 Ti with majority of settings on ultra or high.

[h1] Story: [/h1]
   [b] Campaign - [/b]
      Amazing but short.  A coming of age story in a Marvel universe.
      Gives player a chance to experience all styles of playable avengers.
      Would be nice to have a future update with new campaign plus mode as the story is just that good.
   [b] End Game - [/b] 
      Can be repetitive with most levels re-playable.  Some levels are time sensitive (Yellow icons).
      Increase challenge level (I, II, III, IV - ""R"" keyboard for PCs at war table) leads to more difficult fights.
      Increase difficulty (settings - easy, normal, hard, brutal) also raises level (Yes there are two ways).  
      Eventually unlock epic version of various locations.

[h1] Characters [/h1]
   Six playable at launch.
   Players has a light or heavy attacks with combos and 3 skills.
   Ms. Marvel probably easiest to learn (Think Monkey D. Luffy from One Piece).  Only with a heal skill!
   Flight is fun but could use some work for fighting.
   Some characters have unique skills to smash or unlock doors but not all.
   All playable avengers have unique skill trees.

[h1] Gear [/h1]
    Most similar to borderlands loot and cosmetic system.
    All gear is purely non-cosmetic which is pretty disappointing. 
    Loot is based on player power level.
    Gear goes to 130 power level.
    Average from all gear slots + major artifact level = player power level.
    Additional 10 power levels with upgrades to gear (140) and not cheap at end game - save the cubes.  
    Last 10 power levels come from major artifact (150).
    Worth it to unlock abilities on gear (1 or 2 power levels), but otherwise save resources for endgame.
    Upgrade major artifact is expensive as resource comes from faction dailies.

[h1] Other [/h1]
   [b] Challenge Cards [/b]
     All avengers have unique rewards from finishing unique dailies or weekly assignments
     Expect assignments to take dedication and time but they vary.
     System is [i] persistently annoying [/i] on reminding player can purchase short cut credits (real money)!!!
     All items, including cosmetic can be earned without paying real money and some luck from vendors/drops.

[h1] Recommendation [/h1]
  Yes, Definitely worth the story.  Takes about 12-20 hours depending on playing the side quests, which are  a lot.  Only experienced a few bugs throughout the campaign.  Definitely wish the cash shop would quiet down.    Hopefully can bring in X-men and other Marvel characters in future updates.  The game has promise.  Not a masterpiece as the Witcher 3 but not as far from Borderlands experience as expected.


[h1] Futher Update [/h1]
  Nearly sixty hours of gameplay and still doing end-game mission chain (its long).  
  The hives and elite hives take about 30 - 45 mins to complete.
  Primarily used Ms. Marvel with power level at 145 currently and skill level 50.  
  Rest of characters power level 20-30 power level and 8-15 skill level.
  Characters tend to expand greatly in gameplay options upon selecting skills in the second and third skill tab.
  Got my first exotic gear (orangish color) after finishing the super hive (14 levels) that lets you go through all your avengers though I only needed one.  Pretty sure it was a random reward.
  
  Finished all the end-game quests.  Took me about 65 hrs of gameplay.
  Did I mention save your upgrade cubes for endgame.
  Think I've earned about 600 in game currency from the daily challenge rewards without really trying and about 17k for the currency used at the cosmetic shop..
  Found out you can re-roll the daily challenge at least once if you don't like the current one.
  60+ hrs to finish all quests is pretty good, but wish they had a longer main story.  
  Each Avenger quest line was somewhat interesting as they tend to use new environments.",1599442323,1599766967,True,75,7,0.627780377864837646,9,True,False,False,76561198022016256,121,2,4378,0,2851,1599972372

 the mobs/boss vanishing during the fights.. 
*Lacks of heroes
*Some Graphic issues in the settings that need fixing and some lag spikes

~Would love to see some more heroes unlocked to the story like dlc addons~

74,75736577,english,"I'll begin with the conclusion to save those of you who would rather not read the whole review some time: Do not buy this game. If that doesn't convince you, at [i]least[/i] wait for it to go on sale. The main campaign, which will be the sole draw, is too short to justify buying it at full price.

Now that that's out of the way, let's talk about what's good about this game, and what's not so good about it. We'll give it a fair shake by starting with the good.

[u]The Good[/u]
The game looks pretty good. Bright and colorful like you'd want a comic book adaptation not from the mind of Zack Snyder to look. The voice cast largely turns in pretty solid performances, and the facial mocap is on point, particularly for Bruce Banner and Kamala Khan, who are some of the people you'll spend the most time with. There are nice little touches in the game's animations as well, like how Hulk will stare, perplexed at a treasure chest before just shrugging and kicking it open because he can't push the latch in. These are a lot of fun, and the first time you see them with a character you like, it's hard not to smile. The story also has its moments, particularly when it's focusing on Kamala, who many have pointed out is absolutely the heart and soul of this game, and the Avengers team. She's a wonderful character and, barring a few instances, is used very well.

[u]The Bad[/u]
The standout problem in this game is the game itself, by which I mean the time you will spend actually [i]playing[/i] it. This is a Destiny-style loot collector and faction grind wrapped up in a beat 'em up designed by a team who had only ever heard about beat 'em ups by rough description. In short, the gameplay is [i]horrendous[/i] and at times an actively painful slog. The controls are imprecise, the ranged combat takes you into a lackluster third person shooter whenever you hold down your left trigger, and characters (even Black Widow) feel slow, lumbering, and graceless. Add to this objectives that are so repetitive that each mission boils down to either capturing and controlling an area a la [i]Overwatch[/i], beating waves of enemies, smashing objective points, or some combination of the three, and you have a truly dismal game to spend time with. The side missions are worse, as they are copy/pasted environments, and repeated objectives. The story carried me through this, but only barely. And if that wasn't bad enough, the optimization for PC is about the level we've come to expect from Square Enix, so don't look for even top line rigs to run it well, and be prepared for endless bugs. Many will simply be hard crashes to desktop, but there are also numerous instances of audio or just voice cutting out, characters not animating in cutscenes, cutscenes seeming to cut in/out early, and (hilariously) characters being improperly positioned in cutscenes, leading to some disappearing, or walking through walls instead of doors, or having closeups of the wall where they should be standing while they're talking. This game needed another 6+ months of QA and dev time minimum.

[u]The Ugly[/u]
The skeleton of the story is pretty solid, but the actual writing is godawful. The lines characters speak range from passable in the moment to absolute cringe inducing. One such non spoilery example that leaps to mind is, on seeing a giant drone plane, someone remarks that ""It was genetically modified to find and kill <targets>."" Well, it's a [i]plane[/i]. It doesn't have genes, because it's, you know, not alive. This is about the level of thought and intelligence that goes into the writing of the dialogue and the story's finer points. Without getting into spoilers, the villain's plan is a bit of a head scratcher in terms of his goal as well. The Avengers themselves have the expected levels of manufactured conflict between them, and really only Kamala keeps it from being a total debacle, in part thanks to her voice actress's believable performance as the earnest young heroine. If you're not familiar with the comics (I emphasize comics here, not movies) then you are in for even more confusion as people tend to show up without explanation of who they are or what their motivations are, with the expectation that you know them from the comics, even if there aren't exactly any A-listers in this game aside from the Avengers themselves.

Ultimately, this is not a game that's worth your money or your time. It's sloppy mess of bad writing, worse gameplay, and a bevy of bugs even by Squeenix standards. If you feel you're a big enough Marvel fan that you simply [i]must[/i] play the game, then wait for it to go on sale. Preferably for over 60% off. It may not be that long of a wait.

The menus are annoying as hell.
2 Characters are just useless (Cap and Hulk)
Cap cannot use computers or break walls so you miss out on 75% of the side areas in a mission.
Hulk is just weak overall.
Thor is incredibly overpowered.
The end game is just boring and so uninspired.
The power system just doesn't work properly.
The game is riddled with bugs. (Audio cuts out, characters get stuck, game crashes a lot, NPCs invisible etc)

The glaring lack of optimization is exacerbated by the games uncountable amount of bugs and extremely clunky/messy UI.

Performance aside, the combat itself seems really fun. I wanted a mindless brawler and Avengers gives you that with a cool superhero experience. It doesn't break any molds and introduce anything mind-blowing or remotely new, but just to play as the Avengers was cool enough. 

The game leads you down an obvious repetitive path with a loot system that makes next to no sense while being ironically unrewarding, and without any real impact at the same time.

All in all, this game would boil down to a refund from me and I've only once went through with that process across any platform or console game and that was here on Steam for No Man's Sky. I didn't pursue it only because I unfortunately had 1 FPS in the menus for a couple hours plus trying to lower settings which broke the game even more. I tried to play some of the multiplayer afterwards and unfortunately clearly passed the refund threshold.

I wanted to like it but I can't recommend this to anyone. Without performance issues, the game would still be incredibly average.

You've seen them in the films, You've read the comics, you know their feats and you can't wait to get yourself in the shoes of your favourite avenger! BUT WAIT! Don't go too fast! 

You'll be amazed at how flimsy everyone is! Taken down by a single shot from a robot 50 meters away with a energy bolt that hones in on you faster than the IRS in tax season. Watch in awe as a single mistimed parry results in a beatdown by 7 robots in a second while you're CC locked in your stagger animation! Witness the glory of hiding behind some terrain and picking off drones one by one as you pray your AI controllled companions don't bug out and clip through the terrain into their sudden and inevitable deaths!

The avengers though are a team! You should assemble your own team! But don't get too excited, our 2020 matchmaking system will make sure you wait a good 10 or so minutes for a single person to match with you, just for the game to fail to load the mission and boot you back to the Quinnjet! It has plush seating so you'll be fine as you wait another 20 minutes. Oh, was that Stark Realities? Here's a Crash-to-Desktop first! Better log back in and get back in that queue! It's lonely without you!

Speaking of bugs! Prepare yourself for a flurry of bugs that'll make you wonder, ""is this a beta test?! Is it a alpha test?!"" Unlockables that unlock at level 50 won't be given to you! Rewards will be randomly taken away and even your precious skill points may be rendered moot! Even the developers have said to not use their fabrication machine because it's too buggy to work properly! Remember the days when games released in a complete state? Crystal Dynamics sure doesn't and hopes you don't remember either! Don't worry, looking at yourself in the mirror always results in your torso missing. I'm sure that's how it works in real life too!

But don't JUST throw your money at the game once, remember to buy our MICRO-TRANSACTIONS! Costumes, Name Plates, Emotes, Challenge Cards! You haven't played the game until you've BOUGHT every last inch of the game! If we can shake you by the loins to grab more money from you, by god we will shake until you pass out!

I really wanted to run it as Ironman and the game just wont let you. It is still buggy but devs look like they work on fixing all of them.

Have'nt played multiplayer yet so i can't really say how is it, but i bet it is gonna be awesome when they fix a couple of bugs i heard of.

If you are fan of Marvel or just Avengers, you should really go for it, if you are not, maybe wait for some discount. In general its really solid game. You should just consider if your pc can go with it as it seem the game is pretty demanding. Even with older graphics you can still enjoy it.

Pro:
Solid story driven game, one of the few games I am really loving the story and how its acted out.
Character detail is fantastic.  Emotions showing on face, voice relating the emotions and overall movements of characters more human like; even Hulks scream has veins in his neck pulsing.
Online so far pretty good.
Really like the waiting on train or elevator and jibes sent out, pretty comical.
Microtransactions just for outfits, no pay to win.
Combat can be fun even if its one sided.

Cons:
Voice over is not lined up, lip movement is about 0.25 second early and then voice starts.
Online isn't buggy but people doing odd things.  Waiting for people to join some join and hit start then leave, causing a timer to count down thus having to cancel mission and reload it.  Once timer starts it stops searching.  Then had one where person quit at start of mission causing me and Thor(AI) to solo it.  It took the player and the 2nd AI out of the level.
My biggest gripe is the controller layout.  Pinned post says it supports both Xbox and PS4 controller and shows the correct icons.  My PC registers it as a PS4 controller, Steam registers it as a PS4 controller yet game showing only Xbox icons, no manual way to change this.
If out exploring its annoying Jarvis keeps saying you need to go to the objective every couple minutes.
No option to turn voice off, some people have hot mics all the time and can only mute individual only at party screen.

First things first, I was very skeptical about buying this game considering the fact that it costs 2,999INR & the beta experience of this game was not so good, huge fps drops, stuttering and what not, though i was running a 9700k with 2070 Super and 32Gigs of ram.
But being a marvel fan couldn't also resist purchasing it, all thanks to one of my good friend successfully convinced me that it wont be stuttering and lagging. Thus bought this game just 5 mins before the launch so that I could get my hands on the pre-purchase DLCS.

Now coming to the gameplay & the story part.
Story - 10/10
Game play - 9/10
Optimisations - 6/10 ( It could have been better considering a fact that one is paying 50-60$ for this game alone )
Multiplayer - Haven't tried yet but will give it a shot and update my review on it.
Overall - 8/10. 

The story is very much fascinating & astounding.
The graphics are stunning but with slight frame drops in selective areas.
Lastly there are few glitches too in the game which I think can be fixed easily with an update.

29,75497986,english,"After 35 hours., 2 angry reviews, a shit ton of crashing I've got a pretty good grab on how I feel about this game.
Marvel Avengers is a game that *tries* to balance the cinematic elements of the franchise with a satisfying combat system.

In a vacuum, and in complete working order this is a good game. Not great. But pretty good. The combat while somewhat clunky and unresponsive for the most part is a joy. Each marvel hero is well represented with their kit of weapons, tools and abilities. Every characters upgrades and techniques vary from the others. Iron man has a full array of ranged projectiles, lasers, repulsors, and rockets that each behave differently and lend to a different combat sytle, allowing a player to ""make their own iron man"" that can perform differently in different scenarios. While the hulks abilites are more built around his rage mechanic, allowing him to take much more damage at times than other hero's making him the perfect tank.

However, the combat could be better. Players expecting GOW combat fidelity will be disappointed (although try out thor). Dodging and evading are a chore, that even when performed correctly, leaves something to be desired, (also why in the hell does hulk need to dodge a left hook from a dude 1/4th his size? They couldn't make his ""dodge"" a ""brace"" mechanic instead? Dodging ranged attacks are most likely my biggest bane with the combat. 1. the indicator for ranged attacks is a very bad tell for the shot timing, more often than not I have to spam dodge 3 times in a row just to make sure I dodge a single dude with a gun, then add on 5 other dudes shooting at you and its a confusing annoying mess. I can deal with dodging and countering from a bunch of melee sources,  and even ranged ones if the prompt, counter system for the shot works well  (hello shadow of war worked great), THIS DOES NOT.

For the story, eh its got some moving moments, but man the cringe is strong with this one. I feel like the ""fanboy/girl turned hero"" is a pretty tired in the first place but Kamala, even though her character is very likable and sweet she was so damn cringy it is insane. I cant get through half her lines without wanting to shove my head in the wall. Her character was obviously diversity requirement  born, and I know this is a hot topic, but good characters are designed when a writer has an idea for a good character, not, oh hey how can we design our characters so no ones offended."" That being said Kamala all in all was fine compared to the other glaring issues of the game (hold on). Actually she seems like marvels new test to replace captain marvel, which I am ABSOLUTELY FINE WITH. I'd  take likable Kamala over Brie Larson any day. 
The story campain itself was very short lackluster. I know they're gonna add more with dlc and crap, but Ive never spend 60$ on a game with such a shallow mission content. Which leads me to

Gameplay structure.
This, outside of the technical issues (that will be hopefully fixed) is my *actual* greatest gripe with this game.
And really its the same gripe I have with most AAA titles like this.
For a AAA team and  he amount of time and money invested, this is a cheap toy.
We're about to have PS5s sitting in our living room people and im still playing a AAA title with
INSANELY reused assets, missions structures, objectives, enemies. THE ENTIRE game is essentially 4 or 5 missions chopped up, redecorated and reused. You're basically always either, A saving 3 hostages, B. destroying environment pieces, (destroy the generator!),  C Beating enemies or, D. beating one of the like 3 bosses in this game (they only reuse one and they do it BADLY).
These missions are usually done within 15 minutes and offer very little satisfaction n the long run, especially after you just got done destroying those circle things in the wall again (what are they this time? signal boosters? Generators? Receivers?

Tldr; the big boys at Square Enix, or whoever signs the checks, once again came up to the developers with that old as time, tried and true, ""hey we need you guys to build this big thing, but we DON'T want to spend a lot of money.""

So I'm going to try to shout this real loud, so maybe you'll hear it from up their on top of your penthouses, 
*ahem*
WE THE GAMERS, CAN EASILY SEE WHEN A GAME HAS BEEN MADE CHEAPLY.
YOUR NOT FOOLING ANYONE.
YOU WANT TO MAKE MONEY IN THE GAMING INDUSTRY?
GOOD. 
LETS LOOK AT THE SUCCESS STORIES (before they sold out)
BUNGIE.
BETHESDA.
CD PROJECT RED.
ACTIVISION AND EA (OLD DAYS, FUCKS SAKE NOT NOW)
WHAT DID THEY DO?
THEY MADE A GOOD GAME.
Do you think the development strategy of ""lets try to make this cheaply"" was ever uttered during the devlopement of Halo or Elder Scrolls or GTA?
Those games were made by developers that were gamers that set out to make the fucking game THEY WANTED TO PLAY. (or at least what they really thought people wanted to play) 
This is not that!
I know that all businesses are financially motivated and the gaming industry is no exception, but I, as a gamer recognize the greatest games, the games I went out and spent my hard earned cash on were games that were labors of love for the team that made them. 

Your not gonna be able to short your development and end up with a ""how the fuck did that happen"" like fortnight. Its not gonna happen.
You want a game that sells well and makes money? Make a game I want to fucking buy.
Give your development team the room they need to make their art and stop trying to shove your craptastic, dollar store menu toy, AAA titles that perform about as well as my PS3 spiderman game did.

Now that I got the real review out the way.
Bugs/technical issues.
FUCK.
I MEAN FUCK.
LIKE WHAT?
HOW DO YOU DO THAT?
HOW DO YOU RELEASE A GAME LIKE THIS....
AND THINK THAT'S OK??????
WHAT!?!?!?!?!?

This game, except for MAYBE Fallout 76 is the buggiest, most confusing ball of duct tape, twine and I dont even know what.
Lets start with the easy stuff.
Frame rate. At first launch, this wasnt a game, it was mpre a powerpoint presentation on how to make the worlds worst super hero game. (specifically in combat) it was unplayable. About a week after launch now, and it's gotten better. Still needs some improvements, but only for dips.

Crashing. Most of us in 2020 now have tried to play a game that is more difficult to mitigate the crashes than play the game. For the first 4 days this was that. Some parts of missions were completely impassable. I would crash on average 2 times a mission. This could be better or worse depending on your PC rig. I have a i7 4790k and a  970 atm so nothing great, but not bad either. My friend who has a similar cpu and a 1660 ti had maybe 5 crashes his entire experience. So like I said It depend.
That leads me to general performance. This game was performing like a pototato and crashing on rigs that ran Microsoft Flight Sim like a dream. So obviously this leave of poor optimization is completely uncalled for and a fucking joke to be honest. 
Once again just to reiterate, we have a game that is the technical equivalent to a Mcdonald's happy meal toy when compared to it's peers, Its running and performing a solid 1.2/10 and you have the balls to ask $60 for it? After my play though I feel like this POS is worth 20$ in its current state and that's being generous. But to digress, this game is suffering more from the current trends and development strategies of big AAA developers which is leading to a drop in the fidelity and overall quality we see from games. 
I just can't but help wonder how many other smaller (or less huge, non massively-corporatized)  development teams out there would have treated this IP with the respect it deserved. I wonder perhaps if they had the opportunity and the resources that a AAA team had with the time to let them work, what a better quality of games we could be experiencing.",1599328345,1599733656,False,2,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198296896064,65,10,3865,560,86,1600993571

31,75738114,english,"bought this game regardless of the negative reviews all around the internet because i am a hardcore marvel fan.

in the end, i would say i am quite disappointed.

lets break it down one by one, story wise, it is mediocre, does not deserve the worst hate or the game of the year. Its just an old school beat up final boss and happily ever after kinda story, not really surprising or new. 

the thing i hate the most in this game is the fxxking enemies. when you are playing campaign, everything seems fine. You are able to beat them, dodge them, parry them, chain up combos and etc. But when it comes to multiplayer, it is nothing like in the campaign. First of all, you cant find random teammates at all because there is not enough player base. Therefore you are forced to go with 3 idiot companions which does no good at all. the boss fight in this mode is ridiculous. in a mission we need to take down aim warship, but i picked cap in the beginning, turns out i have to fight aerial enemies in the final checkpoint. Guess what, i died over and over because there are at least 5 rockets fire at me at once, while i have to break down the ship's shield, weak points and everything. all of the rockets are red attacks, unblockable and it follows onto you till it hits you. I dodged it 3 times to make the missile go away. Imagine that you will have to dodge 5 missiles from different directions, dodge robots' unblockable attack, while taking down a fxxking warship while you can barely touch the ship (because cap cant fly, and the ship is always in the air). so i would say it is stupidly designed. at least make all projectiles blockable, then it would be much easier to handle multiple enemies. furthermore, the minions will not stop spawning. WTF imagine all electric robots charging at you like a beyblade at once with unblockable attack, congratulations, just delete the game.

In conclusion, this game has good concept, but bad execution, optimization and balacning. I understand that some people may say gitgud, you are just a noob. Yes I am a noob, I wish to enjoy while playing a game after a long day and not sit in front of my pc for 12 hours just to practice how to dark souls my way through the enemies in the game. Lastly, dont buy the game if you have no friends(because your companions are much more stupid than CSGO AIs), if you wish to buy the game alone, good luck facing all sorts of swarms of robots crawling up your ass and face while you cant do anything except dodging into another enemy's attack.",1599729467,1599729467,False,11,1,0.528126716613769531,0,True,False,False,76561198130857043,13,2,2782,267,1006,1601623896

It's filled with bugs (dialogue that repeats, missions that get stuck, frequent crashes).
The loot is utterly terrible. It doesn't change the way you look, you have to buy costumes either by grinding for dozens of hours, or opening your wallet.

*poor performance. -1
*$60 game with mobile monetization. -2
*Poor itemization and game design. -1
*Matchmaking not working...for a live service game. -2

Final score: 3/10

The short: 
The end game is very grindy in a bad way and the itemization is poorly design, also matchmaking doesn't work, which leaves the entire value of the game on the single player campaign which is very short. Ultimately the value just isn't there. Don't bother waiting for sales, just give this a hard pass.

The long: 
On the technical side, I experience a few crashes and frame rate drops. It's playable but not an unblemished experience. Some missions have the entire dialog cut out.

This is another $60 game with mobile type micro transactions, it's fine if the game is good and you find value in paying more for cosmetics but it is average at best. The end game is quite boring, tedious and repetitive. It is consist of recycling the same few levels and bosses over and over and over again. 

This is made worst by it's itemization and progression. After you hit level 50, the current max level, your entire progression depends on items which influence your ""power level"". To get to higher power level you'll need items that's more powerful than your current ones, seem pretty reasonable on paper doesn't it? To progress you'll have to ditch gears constantly for higher powerlevel gears even if it's worst than your current ones because drops depends on your current powerlevel. 

So if you have a lvl 30 legendary, and you picked up a level 40 trash with no perks and gives you worst performance, to progress you'll have to equip that level 40 trash before you can hope for level 50 drops. For a game design around loot, it sure is unexcited to find anything since you'll be replacing gears almost every level if you want to progress efficiently, the only time the perks matters is if you're at the very end game where power level doesn't matter. 

Higher difficulty influence the quality of drops (not power level, just weather it's a green or a purple), It's also a power level check, if you're 15 level lower, then your hulk will hit like marshmellow to the weakest peon.

If you are a Marvel's Avengers fan, the narrative elements of this game are great and potentially worth the purchase.  Otherwise, wait for a sale or simply pass.  The GaaS trappings feel needlessly tacked on, but the promise of future free heroes and DLC is alluring.

I am an Avengers fan. I am a sucker for anything Captain America. This game is... an oddity for me causing me to second guess my favorite genre. It is an Avengers game with all of the Destiny tropes. I should love it. I've put hundreds of hours into Destiny.

And yet, I'm torn.

The narrative elements of this game are phenomenal. Some of the best voice acting this year comes from Kamala and Bruce. Tony Stark is... well, Nolan North-snark. 

But look long enough and you can see the Destiny trappings - the constant stream of meaningless loot, the massive talent trees that you will not even come close to finishing, the endless daily and weekly bounties, and leveling factions.

Zones that are... essentially waypoint trips with little side areas - Desert, Night City, Day City.

-Great story campaign. It lasts around 10-12 hours, and though it's not anything extremely emotional impactful and phenomenal like some single-player story-driven games, it does have moments that shine. Its greatest strength is undoubtedly the character moments, performed very well by the all-star cast of voice actors. A great protagonist and many of the unique story missions and set-pieces definitely make up for the more generic over-arching story.
-Solid combat system. Each Avenger has a very unique and satisfying move set, and takes quite some time to master. Individual performance relies primarily on being aware of enemies, although there are some mechanics that are poorly designed and feels unfair.
-Monetization. I understand this is a touchy subject, since this game already costs $60, but hear me out. First of all, all future content will be free, including new story missions and heroes, so keep that in mind. I see a lot of complaints about how there will be paid ""battle passes"" for each hero, and on top of that a store full of skins. The thing is, there is a free challenge card for each hero, with free premium currency on it. Therefore, you can simply play the game and save up enough for future paid challenge cards. Additionally, a lot of skins can simply be earned in-game by playing.

[b] Negatives: [/b]
I know the negatives seem to be far longer than the positives, but I think it's very important to be aware of them when a game launches at a really weak spot (think Destiny and No Man's Sky's launch), so don't be scared by the harsh negatives.
-Level design. By far the biggest issue this game has, because the missions that you do all share an exact same template. There are only a few different open warzone areas shared between all the missions, all of the interiors, hallways, and objective rooms are all combinations of the same layout, and points of interests being the exact same kill/rescue/loot gameplay.
-Enemy variety. Another core issue with the gameplay, where almost all enemies you fight are generic, visually similar in way you deal with them, and normally simply elemental reskins of a few base types. Think of how most games have several enemy races/factions, with each race having numerous different enemy types. Avengers has only one real enemy race. Lack in variety also applies to bosses, which the game currently only has 4 of in total: Taskmaster, Abomination, Warbot, and Warship (basically the same as Warbot), not counting the campaign boss, which you will only to once. Taskmaster & Abomination have the same mechanics, and Warbot & Warship have extremely similar mechanics, which means there are only really 2 bosses. This is absolutely pathetic compared to what other games-as-a-service have. Destiny has more than 20 unique bosses with different mechanics at this point, and even Anthem had 6 different bosses at launch.
-Bugs & Performance issues. I like to think that I have a high tolerance for bugs, coming from Fallout 76 and Fallout 4. However, the sheer amount of bugs, glitches, and playthrough-stopping issues in this game sometimes makes it very hard to enjoy, at the very least. I still haven't finished the main campaign due to an infinite loading screen bug on the final mission, if that says anything. Due to the many performance complaints coming from players on Xbox and PS4 (albeit less frequent), and my personal experiences playing on a hard drive and on an SSD, I can safely assume that this game is more geared towards next-gen consoles and higher-end PCs. Therefore, on lower-end PCs, stuttering, hangs, and framerate drops is inevitable. Sometimes, memory leaks will force you to have to restart your game every hour or so, or else your game will almost freeze completely upon loading a new area. However, I believe that technical issues will easily get better over time, unlike the first two issues I talked about, which are harder aspects of the game to improve on.
-Note: I see many people complaining about the loot system, about the arbitrary power levels and how gear doesn't affect appearance, but in my opinion, it's become a staple of games-as-a-service titles, so I am indifferent. The gameplay-affecting elements of the gear system is fairly well done and overlooked by critics, imo.

I may have gone too hard on the negatives of this game, and overall, I believe this game has potential and a great foundation and I enjoyed my time playing this game (yes, even though I can't even finish the campaign). This might be because I generally have a fairly high tolerance for bugs and performance issues, but I also think that the negatives I listed today are problems that can eventually be fixed (if my time with Destiny has proved anything), and the game will get better. If you are a Marvel fan, the solid story and fun combat definitely makes it a worthy try.",1599705394,1599705394,True,40,1,0.641439557075500488,0,True,False,False,76561198118099001,75,13,8103,951,3205,1601718309

98,75726924,english,"TL:DR: wait for a sale 

Combat in this game feels amazing. legitimately some of the most fun whichever character you play. A suprisingly deep skill system. 

The problem comes from the bugs, the balance and the story. Ill start with the thing that I dont think can or most likely wont change. The story. My main complaint is that its basically just using tilesets that are used in randomly generated missions and building a very thin story around it. ""go to this location to destroy the tower"" and ""destroy these relays to stop them from transmitting data"" are actual main story missions that you have to do. theres only about 5 missions that are not like this and two are the intro of the game and one is the final mission. 

Now onto balancing. if you expected a power fantasy balance like borderlands you will be disappointed. This is a destiny style power balance/gear score. If your gear score is lower then the reccomended score by anything greater then 5, expect the mission to be unplayable. You will get two/three shot by even low tier enemies. The other major balance problem is the sheer amount of enemies that can spawn and how difficult it can be to deal with them. on some random missions the game loves to spawn enemies that explode and leave an aoe that lasts a very long time, especially when you have to stand in a small circle to complete and objective. This might not be so bad on its own but with the sheer amount of things that can spawn its basically impossible to focus any type of threat. instead it turns into a frenzy of trying to survive and kill everything. You end up having things like taking a single hit that stuns you and theres so many enemies around that you get stun locked to death, enemies who can teleport away and leave a rift or shoot you with something that freezes you in place to get gooned by the 10 enemies around you as you button mash to try and escape, etc etc. the balancing becomes incredibly frustrating when most of the randomly generated missions have atleast one stay in the little circle objective. 

lastly the bugs and i only mentioned this as a way to encourage people to wait to buy this product. theyll get ironed out eventually.

10,75725075,english,"[b]Story: 4/5[/b] - Don't expect anything award-winning or as deep as other narrative-focused games; It's predictable, sometimes campy, but overall it is a game that [i]celebrates[/i] Marvel comics and the heroes that made it's name. If you can roll with that, then you'll learn to adore the story for what it is. 

[b]Gameplay: 5/5[/b] - Combat is smooth and feels fun, but can also be hectic with the mass amount of enemies that can sometimes spawn in one combat zone. I feel like enemy ranged attacks could use better indicators of when you're about to be hit, but otherwise it's fair if you play smart, have good awareness, and play with a good team that watches your back. Each hero (so far) feels unique, and I think in multiplayer (and especially with a good group of friends who know what they're doing) you can fully realize the full strengths of your hero. There is nothing quite like the synergy of Thor and the Hulk wreaking havoc with their wide-area abilities, while Iron Man and Black Widow surgically cut through the most dangerous targets. I'm personally excited for the addition of other heroes from the Marvel franchise.

[b]Graphics 3/5[/b] - This would be a 4/5 if the game were more optimized, which it needs SEVERELY. I run GTX 1080 Ti, i7 4.20GHz, 32gb RAM, and I'm apparently using 100% GPU whether it's at max settings or the lowest. I crash semi-frequently, usually graphics error related, and according to other forums this is a common problem for a lot of people. Otherwise, when the game works... it's pretty, but nothing to really write home about.

[b]Online 2/5[/b] - With the above optimization issues and frequent crashes, I'll admit I haven't had the smoothest experience with online experience - could be that there is also network issues at hand. I have noticed a few matchmaking errors, especially when a player joins your game right as a mission launches, which can cause all sorts of problems, from infinite loading screens to six AI teammates in a game that's supposed to have a maximum of 4 (granted, the latter is not necessarily a bad thing, but it's still a bug lol) I would say this game is definitely best played with friends, or at least a matchmade team, but there's a lot of fixing to be done.

[b]Other[/b] - There are 'battlepasses' in the game, and each hero has their own separate battlepass progression for you to grind for. The rewards are all cosmetic, which include alternate hero skins and emotes. These can all be earned with the in-game currency, but it is a bit of a grind - I've also noticed a few legendary skins that [i]don't[/i] seem to appear in your regular shops, so those might be locked to real money purchase only... Could be wrong though. Otherwise, it's not the worst affront ever, but I know some people throw a fit about this sort of thing.

[b]Summary[/b] - This game has the usual launch issues and bugs, primarily graphics optimization and matchmaking stabilization, which the devs are currently working on.

Pros: 
- Really god graphics
- Avengers are op, a nice set of abilities, combat is satisfying
- Nice storyline
- Faces are different from Avengers movies which are nice for me
Cons:
- Really bugged
- Crashes are a pain in a**
- Unoptimized
- Shouldn't be released yet ( without optimizing it enough )
- The story is really short ( could be finished in 5+ hours )
- Fighting large number of enemies is extremely hard and pain in a**

31,75446115,english,"this product is not optimized, you will encounter multiple frame drops every 5m and multiple hard crashes that make you restart a warzone and lose around 20m of your time.

This product is also one of the scummiest things ive seen in awhile, they say that you cant buy things that affect gameplay yet i'd consider buying skins for your character that make you enjoy the gameplay experience more as affecting said “gameplay”.

The currency system is ridiculous if you want to buy a legendary skin with the hard currency expect to spend $10-$20 FOR A SINGLE SKIN.

Also not to mention the fact that you are buying a sub par product for the same price as the ps4 owners, as they get fucking SPIDER-MAN as an exclusive. ( lets not forget that exclusives within games are not a way to give a group of people more content its a way to restrict 2/3rds of the player base from content that should be included in the product)

If you are a diehard marvel fan like myself I recommend a price of 30 on sale (doubt that will take long to happen btw) but for everyone else you can skip this garbage game with a cool skin

I've got 33 hours on record since release on Friday so I have put some time into this.    Between the crashes, stutters, long load times, poor matchmaking and many many other issues currently plaguing this game I cannot recommend it.   If they were actually prepared on the loot mechanic, the most basic part of this game, I would say get it if you are an Avengers fan.    But sadly even that part of this game is terrible.   No set armor?   Everyday I have to travel to two different hubs to start faction missions?   Hubs that are pretty much pointless if they aren't filled with other people you can somewhat react with like in Destiny.   I mean if you're going to steal the game design from them at least steal it all.   

Honest opinion is that this can be a good game, I think it was rushed out the door with the intention of fixing it after.   Sadly this game will die on PC due to lack of crossplay and terrible state it is in now.    Even if they fix the performance issues people will get bored due to the grind for absolutely forgettable gear.  

The only redeeming factor is the gameplay, which if tweaked can be very fun.    Too many stun locks and insta-down enemies are used to increase difficulty at the present time.

Bugs I've personally encountered and I experience at least 1 bug almost every time i boot up the game:
- Spawning under the map at the start of a mission
- Loading into a mission never played the cut-scene - just staring at my character with no control for 30 seconds...
- Unable to actually use any of the combat abilities while in game (during Thor's HARM mission)
- Stuck in an elevator after triggering a load - had to reload checkpoint
- Multiple of the same avenger chilling in the jet on the way to a mission (multiple hulks was getting quite crowded in there)
- UI of the menu not even loading so stuck staring at the background.
- 1 enemy that you HAD to kill was invulnerable (had to load a checkpoint).
- The well documented 'skin vendor eating my resources'.
- Enemies glitching through locked doors (was able to kill with abilities through the walls...).
- Game straight up crashing to desktop on various occasions.
- One vendor lady wont stop saying 'seriously.. you're the best' because I picked up multiple of her little daily quests
- Many a graphical/audio glitches - from the world not actually rendering (I wonder why there is always water rendered at the bottom of one of the maps), to character's mouths not moving during cut-scenes, to audio clips from unrelated missions playing on top of one another in post mission screens.

Most of these aren't 'game-breaking' and rarely cost more than a reload of a checkpoint or minor graphical glitches. But there are enough of them, in frequent enough numbers that it's frankly unacceptable.

I also have a few gripes with the actual design of the game I would like to see fixed but that's not the reason I can't recommend this game. I wanted to like it, and did enjoy the majority of my time playing it (when it was working), but all the bugs and issues leave me frustrated every...single...time I play. 

The only reason this review exists is because right after the game full on crashed on me again... steam thought that was the time to show me right in the middle of my screen '[i]Would you recommend this game[/i]'

...No...no I wouldn't, not right now. Time will tell whether this rough start is simply the fault of the publisher rushing the game out before it was ready. I hope to revisit this review in a year or so and all my points be no longer the case.

50,75720243,english,"Ok, so, Marvels avengers. It's.... something. I'll open with this. I get ""Anthem"" vibes from this, but.... not as BAD as Anthem at launch. Ok, so here's some points:

Pros:
- Cool story, introduces Miss Marvel (Kamala khan, first female Muslim hero)
- Game play is pretty fun, each hero fairly different style of play
- Graphics and presentation of story is pretty awesome!
- Coop is a decent. 
- Characters look amazing, and voices wonderfully.

Cons:
- Well, Story is very avengers formulaic (yay avengers, oh bad things happen, avengers disassemble, bad things happening, avengers reassemble, heros win, lol)
- While the graphics are VERY nice, FUCKING HELL the FPS is dodgy. Seeing mad drops randomly, and other random graphical shit on my 2080.
- It's a looter, and loot feels fucking redundant. It artificially increases your power level, without really ever ""doing anything"", or so it feels like *cough*anthem*cough*
- Loot does not change your appearance to make unique looks. It's all or nothing skins. (skins are micros too)
- Games as a service means it's a lil lean, and then there's missions to ""play"", but doesn't take long to feel repeatitious. Same with mobs. More than Anthem, but so many are just the same crap...

So yeah. 20 hours, and it's an ok romp. If you're desperate for a fun romp and money isn't an issue, get it I guess. More of a ""wait for sale"" or, ""wait several months for more relevant content to come out"". I don't know what ""end game"" looks like yet, as I just beat the campaign... gonna give it a lil more time...

*There are some bugs in the game but they will hopefully be handled soon and are not game breaking. Crashes can occur but are very seldom.

*I belive this game is worth buying if you are a marvel fan or want to play a new game for a while. The detail in the characters feel very well made but for me there is alot to be desired with the world maps as you play mission after mission there is not much variation in the maps and i got a sence of repetition creeping up on me. when i finally played a mission were i got to help the cops fighting outside their police station it felt cool and to me we need more of that stuff, side mission helping out ppl in the street and fighting local gangsters as well as the main evil robot making corporation. Encountering new enemy super heroes with their own agenda and so on just like the comics, but we will see what happens.

*After have been fighting the same boss (abomination) in different missions the only thing thats was different was the location you met him in ""somekind of underground parking lot"" and ""end of a enemy base"" makes it feel kind of ""meh""  when there is a huge pool of enemys to take from.

First I tought that new gear drops so fast so there is no reason to tinkle with your gear and upgrade it, no reason to buy new gear because in about 3 missions you will have gotten that gear level in drops, But upgrading your gear to get more powerlevel between missions helps you so you get even more power level drops in the missions and so on.


Pros :
Graphichs - nice graphics and the characters are well made, deatails when ur close is very nice
Single player story - Felt very fresh to  follow the story through a marvel fan like Kamala Khan  to gather the Avengers

Cons:
Missions: Though there are different missions i sometimes got the feeling of repetition, i think they can fix this in the future with different troops, landscape and enviroments etc on missions to further separate them from eachother, like desert, space, snow, mountain etc etc. What im asking for is more variation for the sake of the long run.

some of the bugs i encountered:
10 Elites: Some bugs, not many that will be sorted out hopefully. When you are fighting 10 elites on some  missions (skull symbol) sometimes when youre done fighting, there is 1 left but you cant find him. 
Or you start fight them and they dissapear infront of you.

Often friendly npc fighting with you just stand like manekins while some seems to fight back

Ironmans Hulkbuster: Ironman can deploy his hulkbuster for anyone in the team to use if he wants. I was in an instance when he dropped it on a big spider robot and as i was fighting the robot got in to the hulkbuster and was trapped in the middle of the spider robot and couldnt get out, like a glitch

16,75709572,english,"First off let me say that I am a Marvel fanboy, and that likely is affecting my view of the game overall, I also play mostly as Thor, so all talks of gameplay mechanics will be through his style. I also haven't reached ""end game"" and have only finished the Campaign as of writing this.

The gameplay feels like it's something from the Arkham series, which isn't a bad thing by itself, the gameplay is solid in that game and if it ain't broke, while fix it? But I have noticed that with attacks being divided into Blue, Yellow, or Red attacks it can get muddled real quick on what you can counter with your power set or not. This is also a looter styled game, which means there will be points where if you aren't GEARED correctly, your SKILL will have very little input on how easily/quickly you'll deal with the challenges this game throws at you, and will eventually result in the grinding for gear, which depending on how easy they make it for you to get higher power gear, might take you hours or days, to weeks or months.

I have enjoyed this game mostly through Solo play, this isn't because me and my friends don't have the game, far from it, I have atleast 3 friends with this and a few more on the fence. The problem however, is the game is currently filled with glitches and bugs that can make it harder for some people with less than stellar PC's deal with it, for example one friend has a bug show up that makes everything glow RED and unplayable for them, and another friend who CONSTANTLY DC's in multiplayer.  Currently we are all marking this up as ""eh, it's a PC port that was rushed, there's gonna be issues"" and will wait to see how the game is patched to see if that fixes it and makes it more playable for us in the near future.

The story is rather solid, and FEELS like an Avenger's story.  The characters interact nicely with eachother (mostly) and feels like they REALLY took the time to make sure the story elements were handled well.

Currently, I reccomend this game as a STORY driven RPG, but I hope the multiplayer will be fixed soon so me and my friends can enjoy kicking AIM's butt together.",1599673728,1599673728,True,0,0,0.47826087474822998,0,True,False,False,76561198022999568,421,1,1219,0,1218,1599678677

25,75708660,english,"Here is my review after 20 hours in game bought from day one release 9/4/2020:

Quick points:
(PROS)
- Gorgeous game
- responsive combat
- made with Marvel fans in mind
- Engaging story that was well written (IMO)
- Awesome costumes (SO DETAILED!!)
- The devs seem to be working hard after release

(CONS)
- The game crashes even after the hotfix update on a moderate spec computer
- Loot chests blend in with the environment
- Traversal is a little... wonky? clunky?
- A collector/ completionist oriented gamer will be stressed out

Love this GAME! They took so much time to get the characters to look ""just right"". The detail is out of this world (to me)! You can watch kids play on the arcade machines, you can watch popcorn pop in the vendor area, and you can listen to random conversation that have nothing to do with the story. Very small details like this make the world I'm playing in ""real"". I feel apart of the marvel universe when I jump in to this game. The first level really sucks you into the story as you are the main character, not just the player controlling the main character.

I've read some who have complaints about the story being short. I do not know how they are playing the game, but I'm a little over half way through the campaign and I've played 20 hours in. I have it on hard difficulty and I am not running straight through to the main objective. I am looking at and exploring everything. I do agree with Gameranx on youtube on how there are so many collectibles that I end up passing some of the material boxes and not getting them. The loot boxes, however, I do not want to pass up. The downside is they are black and brown sometimes and that blends in to the environment to me. This makes me paranoid that I have somehow passed over one and double back (which I have passed them).

The bugs in the game. I have experienced some characters not loading in as the dialog happens in cutscenes. The biggest issue I have is the game crashes at different times during a mission and sometimes when I'm almost at the end of the level...very frustrating. Smaller issue is when a lot of enemies spawn in I'll experience fps drops and lag. But, they are working hard on it as their updates suggest. My only problem with that is they released it when they should have let it bake a little longer to iron out some of the bigger bugs (and I get that its largely the investors or whatever that want the game pushed out on unrealistic deadlines).
It doesn't matter the excuse. If it wasn't finished and the game crashes on the regular, it was not done and you shouldn't have been asking people for their money knowing this information.

The microtransactions are not a big deal. It's not a pay to win format. If the devs make extra content for the game like costumes and levels then they have every right to earn more of an income from their work (as long as they didn't purposely lock content while it was still in developement with the intent of making more money off of an already $60 game. It seems like people are just mad that they cant get everything for free, if that's the case well they have some problems they need to sort out.

The last thing I really want to mention is that the traversing is a little weird. Mainly with hulk. Its like the platforms are spaced just far enough away for some characters to barely need the longer jump. With hulk a lot of platforms are just high enough that he can't grab them without his 2nd jump, but the platforms are spaced just far enough away that it can be a challenge to jump just right towards the platform to get that 2nd jump in, to get up to the enemies that are blasting you all the while you are trying to get up there. A little frustrating but it might just be the way I play idk.

All that said, I do recommend the game. It's a great game that shouldn't be passed up. Ignore the people who just like to hate on things. Go in knowing there will be some hiccups, but the devs are listening to the community.",1599672379,1599672379,True,1,0,0.518581032752990723,0,True,False,False,76561198371336546,18,1,1697,0,1149,1600534468

Few thoughts on it Game is beautiful i had no crashes or lags but few frame drop here and there which was not game breaking but yes a little annoying. I have a decent RIG with 1070TI and i5 so its run very smooth on this config. 

Getting back to Story damn it was a fresh new take on Avengers Saga. Every time i saw a new hero on screen which i could play oh that feeling was just too good. Combat is not flawless there are many annoying stuff and many small nitpicks but overall its fun especially since u have so many different style of heros u can play this just get me going.

About Micro transaction well there is for battle pass (kind of) u can say but u actually dont need to buy them cause if you grind u can get all those unlocks. Slow but u can grind those out. There is plenty to play unlocking leveling up hero and stuff as long as square enix keep getting content as its a online service and we can grind. 

From a new comer whos thinking of getting this there are few things you should ask
1- Are you willing to Grind alot.
2- Are you ok with some annoying combat bugs.
3- If You have a good enough PC to run this.
If all of the above are ok then you should definitely give it a try.

Kamala is grating as hell. The camera is an active enemy. Even with settings that are supposed to not correct. It still snaps the camera around so you have to adjust over and over just to keep track of things.

It is so damn buggy. I dont know if they only optmized it for Intel and shrugged with Ryzen chips or what.

The  kinematics are just bad. Characters get stuck on invisible walls non stop. Attempting to evade, or parry? It seems there are no invulnerability frames at all because one dodge is good for one attack. So if you are getting swarmed it is over. 

The balance is also sketchy. The canon fodder enemies, like a regular AIM trooper taking down Thor just doesn't jive.

Mouse overs in gear are also annoying. Move the cursor in the wrong way at the wrong time and you can't see stats of gear. Nope. You are going to look at explanations of what stats do whether you like it or not.

Im still trying to like it. But having to restart levels and no logging at all to the event viewer to allow looking into it. Logs in game folder? They didn't purge crap from their environment.

I find the geargrind, quite well done, I like the stat driven effects. Pim Particles actually make enemies small. Freezing etc all have real and logical effects. I actually like this a bit better then most other gaas games. The downside is that you do not see visual(armor) effects of the gear. On the other hand there is a whole bunch of cosmetics to be found in game (not via microtransactions) that make up for the lack of visual change.

On microtransactions, yeah they are there. But there is ALLOT of stuff just to be found in the basegame. In no way do you need the transactoins and even for just visuall change there are allot of drops in game or buyable via ingame currency.

I also want to adres something I read in a few reviews that mention that there's allot of button mashing. I don't agree with this standpoint, the mechanics and controls are quite smart and I really would compare this more to streetfighter or something when it comes to fighting then a button masher. You need to time attacks, blocks, chains of hits and are constantly encouraged to switch up your tactics. In fact, I play on hard..if I even try to button mash..you seriously get punished for it in a fare way.

Furthermore each character truely plays differently with a huge skilltree to play around with and modifiers due to gear that really change things. I find this quite impressive compared to most GAAS games that basically have the same type of character with a few changes.

For me the base of why I like this game is that the story is just super great, it's like the best comics I used to read. The gameplay is great and graphically it is awesome too!",1599470165,1599666204,True,1,0,0.507672667503356934,0,True,False,False,76561197960384008,263,26,1350,6,965,1601208560

66,75701252,english,"Pros -
• Aesthetically pleasing visuals.
• High-quality voice acting.
• An abundance of potential for growth.
• Unique and interesting characterization.

Cons -
• Lots of annoying (non-game-breaking) bugs.
• Mundane and repetitive gameplay.
• Balancing issues.

Let me just start by saying that I am a *diehard* Marvel fan.  I live and breathe Marvel comics, movies, and games (board and video alike).  With that said, I was hesitant about this game when it was first announced.  The idea of a AAA Marvel video game was enticing, sure, but it felt like there would be tons of missteps that could easily be made to ruin the experience.

However, at this point, I'm happy to report that Square Enix and Crystal Dynamics knocked it out of the park.

Admittedly, the underlying story line for the primary campaign is lackluster and predictable (as others before me have pointed out).  But I think the reason for that is because of the comparisons that Marvel fans are subconsciously making to other Marvel products.  In isolation, though, the campaign possesses a very compelling plot and the story arcs for the characters are quite enjoyable.  One of the things that makes the story work so well is the voice acting.  They did such a good job with the direction for the voice acting in this game and I loved every cutscene.

Another thing that worked very well was the game's representation of the characters.  It's tricky to nail something like that when you have such killer characterizations in blockbuster movies, but I think they handled it appropriately.  There are some homages to the Hollywood counterparts, but the characters still feel very original.  One of the key ingredients is Ms. Marvel.  With the exception of her original appearances in comic books and some minor presence in animated productions, this is the first bit of media within which she's given substantial characterization.  In my opinion (based on my knowledge of the character and her interactions with the rest of the Marvel world), they did an amazing job with her character.

As far as gameplay goes, there's much to be desired.  But much like most of what follows, there's a lot of room for growth and improvement and I'm hopeful that as time wears on, this game will be shaped and molded into something even more spectacular.  If you enjoy games like Destiny, Warframe, or the Division, you're going to like the way this game plays.  The combat has a low skill floor and a high skill cap, so there's enjoyment to be had whether you're a button masher or someone who loves perfecting insane combinations and sequences of abilities.  I will admit that the ability system is great fun and every new skill point unlocks something novel that brings a new layer to the character.  I never feel like my skill points are being wasted on throwaway stats or the like.

Perhaps my biggest gripe with the game is the sheer quantity of bugs it possesses in its current state -- eight days after the deluxe edition's early release at the time of this review.  Hardly any of them are game-breaking, but it does feel a little silly to have this behemoth of a game with so much polish boasting silly bugs wherein character models' detached hair is floating on the ground in time with their bodies' movements.  A lot of these nuisances are things I imagine will get shaved away in the first few patches, but it does feel like they perhaps should have spent some more time in the beta phase ironing things like this out.

All in all, I think this game is an excellent investment.  There are a lot of characters in the pipeline and much like any live-service game, there's going to be oodles of content to enjoy as the game grows and expands.  I recommend Marvel's Avengers to anyone who loves loot-driven multiplayer games and/or anyone who adores the Marvel universe.

86,75679479,english,"Marvel's Avengers is a broken mess. 

The game crashes a lot and when it happens you have to start all over again your mission because there are no checkpoints (or at least not a lot). Matchmaking isn't working half of the time and when it works, people gets disconnected and the mission restarts from the beginning, The loot system is awful and pretty useless. Cosmetics are non-existent. You can get some by grinding the same missions over and over or by buying them with microtransactions. The main story campaign is decent but don't expect Marvel's Cinematic Universe movies vibe at all. Characters faces are emotionless and Nolan North's voice is good but you just keep hearing Nathan Drake over Tony Stark face. One other thing, If you don't like playing one of the Avengers in particular, well you'll be forced to play him/her during a lot of the story missions. Also, a lot of the main characters are pretty absent through the whole campaign so don't expect to play them too much. FInally, for an Avengers game, where teamwork is the key, you spend most of your time playing only one character at the time and solo because of the broken matchmaking.

That being said, I really like this game somehow. I like to play as Captain America, Iron Man or Thor. However I wish that cosmetics where more like Anthem or AC Odyssey; let us choose between different cosmetic helmet, torso, arms and legs. Also, I wish that the campaign would have let us choose what character we want to play from the very beginning and go through the same main story but from the point of view of the hero we chose. This way, we could have had some sort of 5-6 possible replays with different missions/locations.

The campaign of the game is fairly enjoyable - although some people might dislike the main character. Cutscenes are well animated and well voiced for the most part, but when you dig into the multiplayer that's where the game really starts falling apart.

First and foremost; the PC port is HORRIBLE. It's bug-ridden, unstable, leaks memory like a wounded beast, and stinks of poor craftsmanship.

Secondly, there are some REALLY bad design-choices in the game. High difficulty means that ranged enemies are charged up to 11, so expect to be one-shotted. That's not so bad you might think, but consider this: they can lock off from a larger range than your dodge indicators can pick up, so you get no warning either. There's also factions, which give you ... nothing useful. And did I mention that every fight stinks of being designed for single-player, so that in multiplayer it's just a massive, chaotic brawl where you are equally frustrated with your friends kicking your targets away as you are by your targets chaining CCs on you until you're dead?

Personally I love how the characters are written and appreciate the nods they make to the comics and hero origins. I also think the game may get better as time goes on, but that's the big issue. As it stands the game is unfinished. The game is repetitive, buggy, frustratingly difficult at times and can crash at the most inopportune moments.

This game was fun and in 22hrs I was able to beat the campaign which was fun and had interesting story arcs so far and the end missions was truly fun. The problem this game runs into is the combat system and endgame. The draw of this game was to “Play as you want” in theory it sounds fun but in the end game it gives no true scope of what to do. The “In-depth” skills is also somewhat a joke, every hero has 3 abliiltes each which have passives “Give HP, Give skill energy, apply DoT to ground etc.)” i would hardly call this a in depth skill system like said. As with most “looters” their grind is somewhat boring; it only takes 8-10hrs to get almost max gear and level for a hero and. The game is a fun game but there is no end-game to speak of that makes it worth doing. Multiplayer matchmaking in this game is horrible and your most likely to get 1 player maybe and since anyone can launch the missions they will launch it even though you can Veto the start they will keep launching it. MP games also tend to crash or glitch if there Matchmade and often require you to quit (These issues dont happen if you pre-form a group). This game has a good campaign and a fun multiplayer unless you have a matchmake.

Campaign: Great story and fun from start to finish. Some missions can be played multiplayer but not many. I just wish it had more boss fights. If you rush and don't look around for chests or do any side missions it's about 14 hours long.

Multiplayer: Matchmaking is terrible, quick play is the only fast way to find people to play with. There is no drop in feature. Once a mission starts no one can drop in to cover someone who is afk or disconnected. A bot will take their place unless it's done. Plenty of content in multiplayer but leveling can be a chore since each character is leveled seperately. I could be wrong but I think there is some sort of XP modifier based on your highest level character vs your lower levels one. They felt slightly faster to level up.

Pros: 
~ Combat is fun and responsive, I recommend using a controller for force feedback, it feels better for melee builds. KBM is strongly recommended for ranged builds aka ironman. The rest can be played fine on a controller with aim assist.

~ Campaign is really good and has some really fun moments. Very cinematic game.

~ Every character has a giant skill tree to specialize into, it's pretty good but the controls for every combo is basically the same across characters, but I get why they did that. 

~ Tons of content post-campaign. I have been playing ""endgame"" stuff at max level of 50 on hulk for about 20ish hours, it feels good and I'm still upgrading my gear all the time.

Cons:

~ The game has a TON of bugs and is completely unoptimized. 3440x1440p gets anywhere from 45 fps to 70 fps depending on the scene. Editing settings from Ultra to Low have little to no impact on increasing FPS. Thank god for GYSNC! It feels pretty smooth if you have it.
*Devs recently commented that multiple bug fix patches are being released asap, so hopefully it gets polished quickly. 

~ Enemy damage scaling is all over the place. Basic enemies can 2 shot you on Brutal with almost max gear score. Sometimes they don't? 

~Every mission that starts in a lab feels kinda lame after awhile. More distinct areas would be nice.

~ No ""open world"" area like Anthem had. If the game had that type of mode, this game would rise to the top. It definitely needs that instead of just 15min missions to an hour long mission. Mostly you playing with bots because matchmaking is terrible.

~ MTX: You can't buy power in the store but I feel the prices are abit high. The highest price item ( skins ) should go from $14 dollars to $10 dollars. Thankfully you can earn a fair amount of cash to buy these if you max out your challenge cardss for every character.

Overall: I enjoyed the game a bunch. The campaign felt really good and it was one I was hooked on til the end. I played 2 days straight almost just on the campaign + some side missions during it. Multiplayer has issues but I still enjoy it when I actually play with people. It isn't bad playing with bots but it feels better with actual people. I'm gonna recommend the game because while it does have faults, it is generally a fun game at the moment with at least 100 hours of content right now.

Out of 10 matches, maybe one will launch with other people. The vast majority of multiplayer instances result in a crash to desktop or mandatory enemies disappearing. 

The campaign was fun, but very short. It's over within a few hours, and there's no longevity to the game given current content and multiplayer problems.

All in all this game was not ready for release. If you buy now you're paying full price for what is still a Beta access game. Par for the course for Steam atm.

At minimum it needed another 4-6 months in development, but as always with Square Enix, they'd rather launch a buggy mess than anything late. 

Come back in over 12 months when the game is stable, fixed, has content worth the price and is on sale, until then just stay away and save yourself the frustration.


My favourite part of the game: Flicking through Iron Man's weapons mid combat and going with the flow of the fight. Very fun.

My least enjoyed part of the game: I did the last Hive, Last Avenger Standing, took my time to 100% it and then crashed on Floor 14/14. Two hours wasted, and on repeats learning the mission is bugged and isn't given rewards properly.

What is it?  Sengoku Basara (More complex Dynasty Warriors) meets Destiny meets Dark souls.

Combat:  These types of enemies take these types of attacks, and these take these.  If you don't dodge, block, or counter you will lose.

Content system:  I definitely would liked to have seen the full campaign be its own thing rather than move through multiplayer style missions in the middle.  Although I think the story is great.  It really gives even more of a love for Ms. Marvel.  I fully believe that the copy and paste missions, enemies, and environment can be overlooked provided they continue to add new stories with future updates which bring new enemies.  I don't think we will always be fighting just AIM.  Although people need to expect the same combat system even with new factions.  You will still have shielded/flying/sniper enemies because it won't change the combat system, it will be re-skin with new stories.

It definitely feels unfinished but I can't be mad it was released because I am still having a blast with it.  Can't wait for them to expand the roster.

The bosses phase gate, so while you are in the middle of a good combination they just go immune and gate away leaving you stunned and damaged.  

Mini bosses can target around corners but you can miss your limited ability skills by being hit or the mob step out of the way.  They can also heal to full health half way through the fight, while you have a limited number of heals, not for that fight but for the whole encounter.

To start off you WILL have to mess around with settings to make it playable on your system. If not expect crashes, stuttering, etc.

- DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A SINGLE-PLAYER, STORY BASED GAME
        You will be disappointed with the amount of management and grinding you will have to do. This does not have mindless action. You have to be paying attention to what's going on during combat otherwise you will get destroyed over and over again.
- There are plenty of bugs that need to be ironed out. Wait until they're fixed or if it's on sale if you want this game.
         Side note: Despite having 60 hours I was unable to complete the story due to a bug. 
- The difficulty varies drastically, from LEGO Batman to Dark Souls in the same mission. Mind you I've played the entire game (minus HARM rooms as I use them as challenge completion) on Brutal. 
         There's many different enemy types that will throw you around like a wet towel, regardless of the difficulty. This game may challenge you. Or it may be a walk in the park. It all depends on how you play the game.
- The story can either be fast or long. 
          I've heard people complete the story in 10 hours maybe even less. Overall it's enjoyable but you don't really connect with anyone in particular. All of the characters feel like extra condensed versions of themselves due to them getting introduced at different times in the story. 
- Bugs
        I've seen people losing their progress, skins, gear, and levels. I've seen falling out of the map, enemies de-spawning, and much much more. But they don't really bother me that much. It should've been delayed again to iron these things out, but there's just so much fun to be had smashing and bashing enemies.
- MTX
       There's been a lot of talk about MTX in this game, whether blatant lies or hard truths. Personally MTX don't bother me as long as they aren't p2w. And this game doesn't have p2w. Although the price is too high here. $14 for a legendary skin is too much. $3-$5 would be a much better price point as I think it's safe to say more people would buy them than just the 50 people who like them. The challenge cards are positive. They aren't timed and if you finish one character you can buy a new one for no money. To preface you get the six characters in the game at launch's challenge card and you can earn enough credits to buy new heroes' cards as they get introduced to the game. You can go through this game and not spend a dime on any of the cosmetics. But that's just preferance as I like most of the non-marketplace skins

So I really enjoyed the campaign for this game. The problem is after that roughly 10hr campaign, you get to see the real game and how broken it actually is. Traversal is a joke for any character that can't fly that means 4/6 characters are just kind of awkward to use in some areas. On top of that the game frequently crashes and has some frame rate issues. I could ignore some of this if the game was more fun on higher difficulties but again the higher the difficulty the more you see the flaws. Dodging  is finicky and there are even a few unavoidable attacks that just make you frustrated. The homing attacks in particular are infuriating as the missiles can turn on a time and I've often seen them doe a 180 or 90 degree turn after I doge and than half health is taken away so your f***** if there are more than one. My biggest concern for this game is how they are gonna monetize it in the future. Right now the only microtransactions are through skins. This is fine but when one skin costs a quarter the price of the game and the free option to aquire these skins requires hours of grinding only to find out the way to redeem the skins is also broken (I've lost five skins to the fabricator) than it becomes a problem. Also I'm really concerned with the challenge cards. Right now there is a basic ""battlepass"" where you can either pay to unlock the whole card (50 lvls I think) or do dailys / weeklys to unlock some cosmetics and resources. The thing is the way this pass is laid out makes me worried they will add a premium pass in the future. As it is the pass looks like your standard battle pass layout but everything says free under it but there is enough screen space to add a premium space under it.

Edit: I found that disabling HDR helped a lot. Game is now playable, but I wouldn't call it stable. Still hoping for a patch to fix these graphics issues.

Edit #2:
Besides the graphics issues, I've found this game to be very repetitive combat wise. Most moves are recycled between characters heavily. This does not play like most fighting games either. It's clunky. The main problem is dodging. The game does a poor job of introducing the player to how this game handles dodges beyond ""red circle press button"" duh. 
Some abilities cannot be dodged at all. 
Some cannot be dodged, but a ""successful?"" dodge reduces damage you take. 
And then some can be successfully dodged and negate all damage. 
I won't even get into ""aiming"" your dodges.
This system is unique to put it nicely. I thought I was just bad (because I am to be fair), but it turns out that it is this way by design according to what I've found online. I know it makes it more dramatic story wise, but it feels bad from a play-ability standpoint. Questionable game design. 
Combat doesn't feel rewarding, it is very confusing the entire time. ""What hit me?"" and ""How did I kill that?"" are just a few of the regular questions you'll be asking, along with frequent trips to google to determine whether you can/can't dodge an ability. Not to mention the rampant bugs throughout the game.

Some good notes:
Parrying the normal blue/yellow attacks feels great, and ranged attacks are pretty smooth.

It's riddled with bugs, major and minor. Runs poorly sometimes, even on a 1080/i5-8700k. Enemy spawns can vary from annoying to overly frustrating bullshit. Ranged enemies are especially fucked. Enemy variety is like all robots. There's only 2 repeatable Supervillain enemies. Gear is kind of an afterthought at the moment. Some mission designs are terrible and not built around the character you're playing as. Location variety is poor, expect the same bases and bunkers.

BUT when this game is good, it's good. The campaign is well-voice, well-written, and has some fun setpieces. Kamala Khan is endearing and adorable, and actually fun to play. Characters feel good to play (some need leveling up to really shine, like Hulk). Captain America fights just his the MCU version, down to identical animations, and he looks amazing doing it.

3,75675527,english,"I was really excited for this game. I thought about how to review it for a while but in the state it is currently in I can't recommend it. 

Pros:
Interesting characters and good voice acting, and mo cap for cutscenes. I thought Bruce Banner was particularly well done as were Widow and Ms Marvel. (This isn't the MCU so toss out those expectations)
Good campaign narrative - Fun and very comic book like. 
Good graphics and sound - Good all around. 
Heroes: Enjoyed the heck out of Cap, Iron Man, Thor and Widow and you can level their skills to where they are pretty versatile. MS Marvel is fair, but she suffers from range issues during certain mission types and situations due to her shorter than everyone else's range attacks but in general she is fun to play.


Cons:
Balance is so out of whack the game should not have been released - All across the board. Sometimes you get the right mobs and clean house too easily but frequently you are getting one shotted by 3-4 mid-level lackey mobs all targeting you with their big attacks, some you can dodge or hide or block, others are unblockable/dodgeable and you can't hide behind something because they home and pass through terrain. In solo mode the player often seems to be the only target when the mobs first spawn in so you can go down really fast and sometimes with no way to avoid it. 

Bugs: Where do I even start. The are so many crash to desktops that you will spend half of your time loading into the game again even with great spec machines. You can spend an hour on a mission and it will crash as you complete it and you lose mission progress but usually keep item drops and levels. There is no manual in mission save to create backups of your own which is a problem with all of the crashes. 

Hero Switching: Can't switch heroes in bases, you have to go to a mission and then do it so you can't just switch through and work on stuff and explore the bases with each character without a lot of time wasting. Maybe post campaign this is different but not during. 

NPC Hero AI: The AI is good until you fight something with AOE or big hit mechanics that require dodge. They just stand toe to toe with the big hits and take them instead of avoiding the strike more often than not.  The AI is particularly bad when you are fighting a boss and someone is down and they run in to revive them and die in turn instead of waiting for the AOE to go off. I have yet to see them avoid an AOE boss attack or even try. They stupidly use their ultimates on trash mobs constantly.

Heroes: Hulk is weak. Just weak. He can't take hits better than anyone else, his jumping is too short, his dodge is mostly useless because you can't dodge out of an AOE of any size and he just isn't very Hulky. So far his skills are poor too, so he goes from terrible to marginal once you get to lvl 15ish. All my other characters are much higher than he is because he is just so bad I ejected him from the team as soon as I could.  

I really was hoping to give this game high marks but they have some work to do before I can do that.

Kamala Khan, the main character, is the lone bright spot on the game for me, her combat and movement is refreshing and her character's story and script are awesome, A+ for her.

 is generally poorly designed and not fun to play while Widow and Captain America are a blast and have copious combos at their disposal.

Onto my biggest issue with the game. 

With a 1080 TI, playing on 1080p with all settings on LOW the frames drop from 80-120 (average) down to 10-20 consistently. What it seems like to me is any time a door opens the game then loads every asset beyond the door and it causes performance to take a dump and dive. I was able to duplicate this in the beginning part of the game, whenever I walked through a door my frames would TANK.

Additionally, there were a couple scenes where I'm running through a park in the rain and the framerate drops into the same 10-20 range, there's something funky with the assets and how they're loaded in this game that cause huge performance drops.

Audio design is also atrocious, you can't hear where anything is coming from at all, sounds feel muffled and omnidirectional and it's frankly a bit disorienting.

16,75433579,english,"Review:

Note: Worth mentioning, this doesn’t follow the MCU. So if you’re looking at this game because you liked the movies, this isn’t that. Characters sound different, have different personalities, and sometimes use different abilities than the way recent actors have portrayed them. This series draws more from the comic books. I’m here because I liked the movies, and for me, if I buy a Lord of the Rings game, Gandalf had better look and sound and act like Ian McKellen, and use the abilities that he uses in the movie, and be in Middle Earth. Even though technically the hobbit was released in like 1937, Gandalf in my mind is not open to artistic interpretation because the movies have set the image. This general principle applies to Harry Potter, Captain Jack Sparrow, and just about every other character that has been made into an icon recently by actors. So when Iron Man sounds like Ant Man but has Deadpool’s personality, when Black Widow uses a staff, all their faces look like Great Value discount brands, when the whole game is set inside a plot that is more like the Xmen than Avengers, when it doesn’t fit into the timeline of the movies at all and the Avengers are outright villains, it just feels off for me. Maybe if you’re a hardcore comic book fan it will be fine, but it wasn’t fine for me. MCU is the most successful movie franchise in history so to immediately alienate all of those fans seems like a bad business decision.

Story: Voice acting, cutscenes, plot are all quality. The only issue is that it feels like Xmen. Which is fine, I like Xmen; its just not what I was hoping for when I bought an Avengers game. You play as a young Mrs Marvel (the stretchy girl from fantastic four) rebranded as a pakistani teenager in new jersey who just discovered she is an inhuman and is being hunted by robots. Its fine, but all the way down to the costume and the fact that shield is an outlaw organization, its just unrecognizable from the way that Marvel is portrayed in modern media.

Combat: All of the things you’d expect in a big budget action game are included. Active dodge and block/counterattack. Good aerial combat. All characters have light and heavy attacks for both melee and ranged, as well as some attacks that chain from sprint and dodge. They each have 3 abilities, one tactical ability, one direct damage attack, and one big buff. The problem is that even regular attacks stagger you, so you spend almost all of your time, even as heroes that should be tanky, on the defensive, and your iconic powers get interruped by even a basic shot from any angle. You feel like a superhero, but not an avenger.

Progression: There is equipment (not visible), cosmetic costume unlocks, and a talent tree. While it does a good job of making sure you always look and feel like a superhero, it never actually mixes up gameplay, which can make things get stale as you progress.

Co-op: A few major things need to be accounted for in a big budget marvel game that this one failed to do. The first is that Marvel has a lot of heroes and villains. The selection roster is extremely small, and to top it off, all of the heroes can do pretty much the same exact thing. There’s not much in the way of roles or playstyle differences between them, which severely limits the depth of teamplay. They should have done character design in a way that let them include more heroes. Likewise, I’ve only encountered 1 villain in 14 hours. Its just not anywhere near enough. The other thing about marvel is that there are tons of enemy factions. Hydra, Chitari, Kree,  countless mercenaries and terrorist organizations, etc. All of it is left out. There are two factions, AIM (generic robots) and Watchdogs (generic humans) - the problem is that they use the same weapons. Fighting them feels exactly the same. The lack of heroes and enemies combined makes what is supposed to be a massive and interesting universe feel small, and the lack of diversity in the way everything plays makes the game grow stale quickly. 

TLDR: The game missed the mark in a big way. A lot of people who are coming here because they liked the movies are going to hate how this game acts like the movies never existed, and the fact that you don’t realize how far off it is from what you’re expecting until you’re past the 2 hour mark so you can’t return it is going to make a lot of people not thrilled, especially on a game with a $60-$80 price tag. Teamplay is lacking, enemies are generic. Top it off with microtransations and as someone who played City of Heroes, Champions Online, DCUO, and absolutely loved every single superhero movie in the past 20 years, I am tired of this game before it even officially released.",1599235160,1599610600,False,29,2,0.522077083587646484,0,True,False,False,76561198024599399,186,50,1516,0,817,1599552637

I am also a pretty big disney critic. 

 The story is actually not bad at all give or take a couple of lines but thats personal preference. I am about 10-12 hours in atm. 

The game play mechanics are surprisingly FUN and that is basically the point of a video game. I am HAVING FUN and i cant say that for many games recently. 

You are able to choose between a set amount of Marvel heroes including a, new?, hero named Ms.Marvel whose gameplay is my personal favorite so far. 

Each hero has their own personal style/flavor of attack but the basis remains the same for everyone. Light ATK/Heavy Atk and Ranged.

Of course each hero has different abilities and advantages/disadvantages with each variation of attack. 

You use Skill points on level ups to colectivly MAX out three skill Trees across 3 different pages being, Skills, Masteries and Ultimates? i think, Hero attacks or something like that. Still a noob here! 

There have been reports of technical issues regarding the game like CTD and poor preformance that imo comes with releasing a game too early. 

The mechanics of the game are all here and are VERY fun but I can see how angry people are in regards to the performance.

Hold off. Save your money. If it gets good, it'll be down the line.",1599606874,1599606874,False,2,0,0.519999980926513672,0,True,False,False,76561198054964755,195,4,400,0,400,1599353362
34,75482020,english,"Having now beaten the game, I can confidently say that the solo campaign is a solid experience most of the way through. Exciting set pieces, engaging story, great characters, and a lot of love to the brand all come together to create a unique and satisfying campaign. All six characters play distinctly from one another and are visually pleasing to play as. As a solo game, with the expectation that bugs will be patched out soon, I'd say Marvel Avengers is on par with Tomb Raider, Uncharted, and Jedi: Fallen Order. 

The game isn't receiving much praise for having a solo campaign that is FAR better than other looter contemporaries. It's also being derided because it took the path of Anthem by making loot boring while animations, character graphics, build dynamics, and everything else were prioritized to be plenty exciting and diverse.

What it doesn't do well is also plentiful and I'll mention a few irksome elements below-

If you're not playing a super-strength hero you can't pass breakable obstacles blocking loot boxes. AI can't be instructed to destroy these obstacles, or anything, and you must play multiplayer if you're going to play as Captain, Iron Man, or Black Widow and expect to access everything on a map.  

Bugs and performance issues really show in the last half of the story. Memory leaking is a severe problem during extended play. 

Multiplayer lobbies can often remain in limbo.

Enemies critical to progression can be knocked off the map but won't count as dead, leaving players to restart to their last checkpoint and sometimes requires an entire mission reset. Progression for items and experience is fortunately kept. 

Loot, as mentioned before, feels insignificant and arbitrary. I prefer what they focused on instead, but I can see this being an ongoing issue for Marvel Avengers as it was for Anthem. 

Anyways, I'm sure I can think of more pros and cons, but ultimately I think this game is great regardless. My first play through was on Hard and I felt the combat to be challenging and exciting at that difficulty level. Mileage may vary, but I think the game was worth full price and has the foundations to keep me interested for some time to come.",1599308566,1599606727,True,1,0,0.522920191287994385,0,True,False,False,76561197986712875,385,17,3284,64,420,1601409473

36,75433561,english,"Update: I do want to say that I somehow avoided a very large number of glitches at the time of my review. AMD cards seem to have less problems than Nvidia cards (very uncommon) and the vast majority of the steam base is on Nvidia cards. I had few performance isssues and few crashes. But they tend to come in waves, most of my crashes on come in the same 2 days and back to back. It can make finishing missions impossible. The game's post campaign content has a dizzying array of bugs, most of which are polish issues but there are issues with checkpoints getting frozen. Normally you can load checkpoint without leaving the mission to resolve it. The game desperately needs a join in progress, which would make it far easier to find matchmade games and easier to rejoin missions you crashed out of. Certain single player missions are extremely frustrating but I just thought it was because I played on hard. My friends have told me they are a pain on normal too. There are valid criticisms for this game, but calling it a button masher with shit loot, those are not valid complaints. Those are people not embracing the systems of the game. The loot is serviceable, it's pretty bad in the beginning but the farther you go, the more the stats of the items matter more than their power. The game goes out of it's way to not cram loot down your throat for the early stages. Each character has an insanely unique playstyle and it's one of the best selling points for the game. It's hard to get bored even through repetetive missions when the number of ways to play is so high, kind of like warframe. The perks on items have a wide range of useless to pretty great, but the issue is that the game forces you to abandon them so rapidly in order to keep increasing your power. If you get all the way to 150, there is definitely some theorycrafting to do. It's just a shame it takes so long before you can really engage with the system. QoL is not great at the moment. The game kind of feels like it's missing aspirational content. Still a solid 8/10 for me, without bugs it'd be a 9/10 and with some more QoL and aspirational content it'd be a 10/10.

 Look, if you have ever fantasized about what it would be like to be on the battlefield with the avengers, the game is for you. Period. Don't listen to youtubers who've made their stake denouncing AAA experiences. Don't give any credit to the review bombing masses. Just try it. This is NOT another soulless, cash-grabbing stain on a franchise you love. This is honestly one of the best super hero experiences ever made, and if you don't believe me, just try the first 30 minutes. You will instantly realize the incredible amount of character and quality the game has in the amazing intro, and the intro alone flipped my beta expectations on their head.

This is really two very different games in one - a grand single player campaign and a looter shooter mashed together, and they admittedly don't do the best job of integrating the two. You will need to finish the entire campaign before you can fully  engage with the multiplayer components. The thing I'm here to tell you is that both components  are worth the price of admission on their own, so if you're the kind of person who likes both styles of games, you're going to be really blown away. The big shocker is that the single player campaign is incredible - just a small notch below the greatest super hero games ever made like Arkham Knight and Spider Man. It has a fantastic story, great reveals, and emotional hard-hitters, with an epic finale.

You get all that plus a coop experience that is in much better shape than most live service games are at launch. It could use some more mission variety, and the bullet-spongy enemies often force you to have to suspend some amount of disbelief, but the core hook of hunting down vault missions and bosses combined with the phenomenal character variety make it engaging enough. To get the most out of this game, you really need to engage and experiment with each character's moves. Most of them do not start off with core, character-defining abilities unlocked, but I have leveled all 6 characters a pretty decent amount and they all play exceedingly differently and I absolutely love most of them. I found that playing characters with full move-sets against the scarier enemies that were not in the beta gives a much fuller combat experience than what we experienced in the ""button-mashy"" beta.

Update: A note about gear, there are perks for gear that give powerful, character-specific benefits, but I didn't find any until like 40 hours in. Until you start running vaults at higher power levels, gear is mostly placeholder. I know that kinda sucks but it does eventually get interesting.",1599235138,1599606281,True,3,0,0.494069576263427734,1,True,False,False,76561198068534122,245,31,7622,373,2346,1601336203

Yes the story is to short BUT i have noticed that it kinda ends on a cliff hanger so IMO that means they are going to add more big time villains therefor adding more story and with the not finished state of other games out there it is stupid to nitpick a short story, ya know like ya can't find anything thing to b**ch about so you just start making up shit. reminds me of the times GTA was getting in trouble when all it was, was a damn video game., So IMO i think little kids that complain about it not having enough story needs to play the rest of the game (ya know like the missions i keep having pop up) I thought ""damn-it, why does it have to be a short game?"" and then it kept going.

IMO it is worth the full price tag just to be able to play a good Marvel game that isn't Lego but if you are so damn cheap, go ahead and wait up to 3 years before you play it and then after watching all the youtubers play it and then the game won't be so great because you won't be seeing anything new for the first time.

If you love bug free games, high quality textures (4k), epic multiplayer fights, great side-story mission you will hate this game

but this game is horrible.
Most of the times if you start missions with a group of 2 or more friends the game stuck in black screen and everybody needs to force crash the game and restart.
In some cases you stuck into Jarvis and have to force crash.
Some missions does not allow specific heroes without any notice, 
just the player who has to change his hero gets a message, 
the game for all others crashes.
If the Nvidia  GeForce Experience client bubbles a notification that a new driver is available, the game instantly crashes with an error ""display firmware error, new firmware available""
The game crashes to let you upgrade your graphicscard firmware?
NICE!

If you play with two persons and one got gearlevel 80 and the other 40 you can play every mission on difficulty 4 and it feels like 1, get awesome loot (just legendary) and ultra fast level your heroes!
But you have to make sure that you have more than 30 points difference!!! (if not you will get heavy damage and this will not work any more)

64,75667737,english,"To start, I enjoyed the story/campaign so much that I sat through the full credits...thousands of names were listed and I want to THANK all of them for being a part of such an amazing game.

I took my time purchasing this game. I watched many reviews from reviews I respect...all them said pass on the game. But I really wanted this game. So, I watched on Twitch some and everyone seemed to be having a good time.

Anyway, I took the plunge and I am glad I did. Here are the perks for me.

1) I got to not just watch an Avengers movie...I got to BE in an Avengers movie. It was epic. Sure, I would have like to play a male protagonist, but the story was so good and the game so fun to play that was soon forgotten. The story was well written and well acted. It was delightful.

2) The sound effects, music, graphics, and game play FEEL like the Avengers. All are very well done. I enjoyed playing Ms. Marvel, Thor and Captain America more, but all of the heroes are fun in their own way...except for Hulk...I just cannot stand the Hulk....sorry Hulk fans ;-)

3) I spent 17 hours playing through the story/campaign. I played nothing else until I finished it. On the day I purchased it, I played for 8 hours straight with some small breaks...I was that absorbed. As an older guy, when I think back to the games I got for $50 back in the 80's with my Atari 2600, this game is a steal at $60. For the pure joy I got playing this game, the $60 was a good buy for me. 

As far as cons, I have experienced 2 crash to desktops, but otherwise, my system Ryzen 2500x with a GTX 1070ti and 32 gigs of ram runs the game great. For me, these are the only cons....so many others out there will nit pick this game, or any game for that matter, to death. Well, if you do that, you can always find a reason not to buy and play a game, but if you go into a game determined to have fun, you shall find it. 

I would say to those on the fence to consider how much you would love being IN an Avengers movie. If you love story and love action/adventure games, I don't think you can go wrong with this game. If money is tight, then, sure, wait for a sale.

Finally, I am really hoping that future updates to this game add more story and not just more playable characters. I would gladly pay for updated story DLC to this magnificent game.

71,75666339,english,"My recommendation is based on the single player experience alone and as stated at the bottom I do not recommend this game for multi-player at the moment.

Single-Player: Story

From the moment you start the campaign you truly feel immersed in a Marvel experience. Each character feels true to who they represent (sometimes a little closer to the film version than comics though).

The story itself feels like it was taken straight out of the comics and is told through some great set-pieces with fantastic interactions between the cast. The pacing ensures that each mission (aside from 2-3 missions ripped straight from the multiplayer) is truly an experience  and makes you feel like the hero you represent. While the story does have a few twists most are easy to decipher but still enjoyable nonetheless. 

8.5/10

Graphics:

While I know a lot of people are having issues I myself did not experience any problems and the visuals were stunning. Now when I say this I mean what is going on around you, a closer inspection of the characters and terrain you can see that liberties were taken in some areas but the spectacle of all the powers and chaos around you make you forget the minor things very quickly.

9/10

Gameplay:

Absolutely loved it! Each character feel unique, sure a couple have similarities with obvious counterparts but when you played as Thor you felt the might of MJOJINOMIR or as Hulk you....smash..... Now what did feel tacked on was the gear, aside from legendary and exotics the majority of the gear felt like it was a tacked on system that barely made in impact on how you played. I know this changes at higher levels but for the Single-Player experience you never get that high of a level to see it. This is another thing I would like to point out. By the time you complete the campaign, even with a few extra missions sprinkled in you will be hovering between levels 10-15 so you will not see a lot of the skills the game has to offer. This is something I feel was intentional to get people to play Multiplayer more that I will touch on further down.

9/10

Sound:

Voice acting is top notch, but some of the characters do feel less impressive from an audio standpoint specifically in regards to there skills. Thor is the god of thunder, but sometimes his attacks sound like he just had a little spark from not using a ground wire....same with Hulk instead of SMASH you get Smehsh.

6/10

Multiplayer:

I wont moan about the micro-transactions as much as this has been beat to death but I will say that the majority can be earned in game, albeit with a lot of playtime. The daily and weekly challenges are pretty easy and give you fast progress which in turn give you credits. What does irk me the most is how inconsistent the servers are and how the matchmaking is a joke considering the size of this game. Also balance becomes a huge issue the higher in power level you become. I did not delve to far into the multiplayer as I am waiting for more patches.

Current 5/10

Should have gotten a refund. I had to do a double take and make sure I wasn't judging a Early Access  game too harshly, I wish I was, but sadly nope.  For a finished product its buggy as hell (Faces not loading skins except for eyes and teeth, floating limbs not connected to bodies, and repeatedly crashing to desk top mid boss fight). It really did not feel like a modern release As it stands this is becoming unplayable, and I expected better from a Square Enix game.
 
The campaign was fun enough for what I got through, however it did feel a little forced.  The looter part seemed to be cool but you get no visual representation of the gear on your hero so that's a bit meh. Lots of nods to the fans for what thats worth.

First of all the positives

1. Premise of the game is great and has lots of potential for the future.
2. Campaign, even though short has a nice comic book feel.
3. Combat is fun though repetitive, which is normal for this style of game.

Now the negatives.

1. The game constantly crashes.
2. Its full of graphical and audio bugs, we're talking a lot for a AAA game.
3. The game constantly crashes.

There's loads more I could put down in the negatives.  Lets just say the overall experience of a game I've been looking forward to has been extremely poor.  Hopefully they'll patched this up and get things running relatively smoothly sooner rather than later.

The game's crashing bugs have been fixed and I give props to SQUARE ENIX for the fast act in patching this up. I have finished the campaign and it is amazing. Even though it is very short it is filled with amazing moments that looked and felt like I was in a movie. I enjoyed each of the voice actors even though some are better than others (for example: Bruce and Kamala) There are still tons of things the developers need to tackle in order to make this game more enjoyable. Once you get to the end game and you start doing repetitive missions for better gear and power everything starts to get boring very fast. The open world missions are a not enjoyable as you have to jump or fly your way to the objective. The surroundings feel dead unless a random group of enemies show up. The gear is by far my biggest let down in this game. In my opinion it is ANTHEM level bad. I still have not gotten the exotic gears but I have already gotten golden gear and I just do not feel any difference. I love the foundation of Marvel's Avengers but it needs a lot of work and fast response in order to stay alive and not die. PLEASE PLEASE ADD CROSS PLAY. If you are an Avengers fan I totally recommend this game if not I would wait for a sale. At this time Marvel's Avengers is a 7.5/10.

[ORIGINAL REVIEW]

I am trying really hard to enjoy this game and it just keeps crashing on me. It has crashed already 3 times in the middle or at the end of a mission and it is really annoying. The campaign so far is very enjoyable. Hopefully they fix this bugs ASAP. Will edit this review once I progress more into the game.

14,75658221,english,"So I was really excited and hopeful about this game but I am kind of disappointed by it overall.

My main issue with it is that it feels ""small"". All the areas a tiny, all the enemies are basically identical, all the gear is boring, all the cosmetics are just color changes etc. It's just... Small... Since this is a wanna-be live service I will be comparing it to the likes of Destiny 2 and Warframe.

Pros:
1. The story of the campaign is kinda good. Kamala is definitely the best character in this game while the rest are kinda just meh both in voice acting the models themselves. But the story is only good when it's not bogged down by meaningless encounters and boring fights. Literally the first hour or two of the game were the best thing about it.
2. Each hero has unique powers and combos.
3. You get to play as the main Avengers characters.

Cons:
1. It feels small. Everything from the levels to the character selection to the gear and cosmetic options are small.
2. Every area feels exactly the same. So far I've had several missions in snow, desert, city and forest, and every single level felt the same as the previous one in that same biome. If would have been much better if they had kept it in the city you start in as it's painfully obvious they put most of the work in it.
3. Every mission is exactly the same.
4. There are a grand total of about 5-6 enemy types.
5. The visuals are not that great. Compared to something like Destiny 2 or Warframe it's mediocre at best considering this is made by a AAA studio. In the other games every area feels unique, different and epic in scope and visuals, but in Marvels Avengers every area feels small, similar and dull.
6. Crashes. First day everything was OK. Played for several hours with no issues. Patch comes in and I crash after less than 20 minutes in-game :|. This isn't a huge deal for me but still a little annoying.
7. Cosmetics are basically just color changes. There is no real variation in the costume models and I see absolutely no reason to try to get them.
8. In gear only a single number really matters and that's the POWER rating. Compared in Destiny where each piece of gear has 4 stats each one contributing to the overall character power level. Not to mention that each piece of gear has it's own model and designs.
9. And speaking of gear WTF is up with Hulks gear?! Am I switching out his fing spine and bones?!
10. Iron Mans repulsor... FFS... It feels like you are throwing baseballs that travel in slow motion. It's so boring and it's graphics are so dull. It's basically just a capsule with an emissive material on it. Marvel have spent the passed 10 years showing us a badass repulsor that is kind of like a beam or short burst of super heated plasma, and here we get a capsule in slow motion. Good job.
11. Speaking of Iron Man, his jogging animation is absolutely horrible. He looks drunk swaying from side to side. This is what I imagine an alien would look like trying to imitate a human jogging. It's just silly.
12. Tony's interactions with Bruce. [spoiler] So the first scene where they meet again after the events in San Francisco is great. Tony is pissed at Banner and he shows it, no holding back. Then you get back at the carrier and it's like it never happened. [/spoiler]

The game seems unfinished as of 9/8/2020. Started crashing on high settings for my Alienware so I bumped it down to the medium preset. Same performance. Besides the crashes, characters didn't load. While fighting Abomination, I paused the game for a minute. I unpaused it and Abomination had disappeared. I couldn't finish the mission and had to restart. I've had to restart while trying to get the missions from the war table to load as well.

Initially I was going to wait for this to become cheaper, but I thought I'd give Square a chance. I enjoy the story, but the gameplay is confusing and lacks direction. We're supposed to collect gear, comics, and other items, but it doesn't seem purposeful. The movement is restrictive  at times. You can't easily retrace your steps to collect anything you might have missed. 

Once I got to the point where I have access to the War table(?), I thought things might start to get better. Unfortunately I was wrong. I was confused how that was supposed to work. While traveling to the destination, I couldn't figure out the purpose of that whole screen. I had to restart as we never got to the destination. The second time, I did get to the destination, but only after moving through screens. I completed the mission and one of the most annoying things about this game happened. There didn't seem to be a way to exit the screen!

29,75655900,english,"While this game does a lot for fans of the Marvel Avengers, it is also a very lazy execution in my opinion and the game should have gone trough a few more months of development. 

The battle mechanics are engaging, however incredibly unbalanced. 10 hours into the game and it feels like it's already way too hard to play on normal. Dodges and attacks are sometimes completely random and even though you dodge some attacks, others land without any sense. 

Additionally, there is a ton of in-game props that just look cheap and you can tell the developers have rushed trough this game. Upgrades all feel the same, no customization of character equipment and i could go on and on... 

To summorize, it feels like one of those cheap ass games that you buy after a movie comes out, which are just an afterthought. I am looking forward to getting a 3080 just to see if the game looks any better then but I am disappointed by Square Enix on this one.

One example is crashing after missions are complete so credit does not register. Its to the point where i am changing my score to not recommended*

PROS
1. Story is an amazing but predictable experience from start to finish and voice acting was on point for the most part except for Iron-Man.
2. Game looks wonderful.
3. A decent buy if youre a marvel fan with expendable income.
4. Widows face is fixed!
5. No loot boxes.
6. Populated world instances feel alive and is a pleasure to stop and take in.

CONS
1. Spider-Man and some other content will be playstation exclusive going forward as of right now. Essentially making this game 98% complete for xbox and pc.
2. Crashing is insane; For one, I play widow and using her stealth in the middle of a high density mob usually crashes me using the all enemy takes more dmg specialty.
3. Sometimes myself and enemies go out of bounds randomly when launched, or collide into walls may it be from knock backs, using take downs, or collision from grappling hook climbing too fast (again i am a widow player and her take down has her flipping around a lot).
4. No chat box option for multiplayer.
5. Subtitles is a must to turn on since you will miss dialog due to everyone talking over each other sometimes in the cinematics or they just wont say anything at all but the captions will pick up hidden dialog.
6. Matchmaking only allowed during prep screen and players can not join games already in play (not sure if direct invites work). As of now, it hardly exists. There may need to be a more forgiven filter so games can get in and out more fluid.
7. Combat needs a second pass. Way too many times you are given the option to dodge and or parry but can not due to being locked in animations chains that was a good idea then but ends up being a bad idea in an instant without being able to respond. The fact dodge/parry are both different bindings alone is kind of absurd in the first place. Just expect to keep asking questions about what killed you or what is currently is happening.
8. Camera is pretty scuffed. Defintly needs a zoom out option.
9. Copy pasta destiny loot system without the actual destiny world sandbox hurts to say the least.
10. Nolan North really deadpools Iron-Man up like crazy. Its actually cringe.
11. Enemy variety lacking.",1599250089,1599579221,False,0,0,0,0,True,True,False,76561197972723948,148,8,7014,11,4926,1601211187

**************OLD REVIEW*****************



We've been duped by clickbait youtubers and outrage culture. THIS GAME IS AWESOME!

This game is an Avenger's power fantasy built for people that love looter shooters and the MCU. The main story is so well done I consider it on par with the 2018 Spiderman game. There is 100s of hours of content in this game. After finishing the main story at about 17 hours in, the real game began. The second part of the game features multiplayer destiny esq missions all with the chance to get more loot to increase your heroes power. Every Avenger plays fairly different giving you a variety of play options. I could seriously seeing myself play this for over 500 hours before hanging it up for a while. This is the most slept on game of 2020.

There are some cons..

There is NONINVASIVE microtransactions that you barely notice if you arent into that thing. They are not ""pay to win"" they are purely cosmetic and honestly most of you play games with WAY more mictransactions than this but for some reason because its the MCU, youtubers wanna get them clicks.

There is some FPS drops that are optimization based. I have a 2080 super and an i9 and some crazy fighting skirmishes really dropped the  framerate in some cases, The lowest I've gotten is like 14 once when literally all 5 heroes were using their ultimate ability. It does seem like square enix is aware of the issue and they plan on pushing some optimization changes.

But overall, I give it a 8/10. Its a wonderful, addictive, experience worth the price of admission!",1599241094,1599576461,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198159265900,178,3,4603,0,1739,1600611315

-Item drops are plentiful
-The friendly AI is actually good,  which helps out immensely with epic boss battles
-The sound fx are on point
-All the individual avengers feel powerful and the character talent customization is fun
-The hidden strongboxes and other loot throughout the maps makes it fun and rewarding: reminds of of 90s and 2000s arpgs

Cons:
-I have to have my computer sound turned up 300% higher than with any other games, which is fine when I remember to turn it down before watching a YT video or stream, but scares me S***less when I forget

75,75647023,english,"Wow, over 4,700 reviews of this game at the time of this writing and many of them do not paint this game as being a stellar AAA title. I get that, but I still really like this game.

Lets start with performance. After reading some of the complaints in the forums and other reviews, I was really worried as I watched this game slowly download. I don't have the latest and greatest PC, but it has been generally good for gaming until I waited for the announcement of the Nvidia 30xx series. i7 6700k, 32 gigs ram, GTX 1070. I was pleasantly surprised when the game ran well and having played through the campaign it maintained 60 FPS with mostly high settings and resolution scaling enabled (running 1440p). There were a few instances towards the end, in extremely chaotic sections, where I saw a significant slowdown and then it was only a brief drop to ~30 fps and it came right back. It certainly ran better after the patch on 9/6 as I was not longer seeing my CPU pegged at 100%. 

Bugs. Yep, there are bugs but fortunately for me I am not seeing the number of game breaking bugs plaguing a lot of other people. My first issues were game crashes, which is one of the worst kind. I updated my drivers and never saw that one again. The other two big bugs came at the end of the campaign - one I was playing as Iron Man flying around a city and glitched through the map. I could not get back so had to restart from the last checkpoint on that one. The second was while playing the Hulk. When you destroy the last enemy in a wave, there is a quick slow-mo as the enemy is defeated and the game quickly goes back to full speed. In this case, it did not go back to full speed and I was stuck in slow-mo for the next two waves until a cut scene ""reset"" things and I was back in business. I suppose I could have reloaded the checkpoint, but I did not, so not sure if that would fix that one or not.

This is my experience with the technical issues, and I truly feel bad for everyone that is plagued by much worse issues.

The gameplay is great, and the characters are different enough that they don't feel like cheap re-skins. All of the special and super abilities are really unique and interesting. The type of gameplay lends itself to controller play and I did use a PS4 controller, though I am traditionally a keyboard and mouse user. Some of the characters feel more ""locked"" to me while others it feels as if things like dodging are very hit or miss. This could very well be that I just need to get gud. 

The levels are very similar in look and feel as you progress. It seems that there is either the metal and glass interior, rocky canyon, or city. Generically of course. The city levels were under-represented in my opinion, and hopefully the post-campaign gameplay features these more. I am assuming additional content will be delivered at some point and can only hope that it contains varied level design. I imagine that creating levels for this game is a uniquely challenging proposition considering that you have characters of varying modes of transport that have to traverse the map. Not everyone can fly.

The majority of the art is well done. Character animation is good and its pretty awesome to throw Thor's hammer, turn around and punch some synthoid, and have Thor hold his hand out and catch Mjolnir without looking. There are a lot of these little details and they are extremely well animated, and it really upped the overall production of this game a few points for me.

The story is an original one and feels a lot like the movies, or even a comic. The voice acting and cut scenes are so well done that they were able to pull an emotional response from me which is rare in a game. I thought it would be off putting that the characters looked so different from their movie counterparts - we have come to know these characters as their movie star counterparts, even those of us that grew up enjoying these characters in pulp format - but that concern disappeared minutes in. The relationship between Bruce and Kamala is quite special, not to mention [spoiler] Tony finding Steve on the satellite after five years of thinking him dead [/spoiler]. Kudo's to all of the voice actors, writers, and animators in this game, job well done.

I can't comment on the multiplayer too much. I played a few missions with other people during the campaign when that option was available and it worked smoothly from what I could tell. We will see how things progress in the post-campaign looter style of play, which I am looking forward to. It does feel like all of the characters are well balanced.

I don't like micro-transactions in games. Period. I am old school and think this additional revenue model is ugly. BUT, I have to view this through the lens of reality - I watched the credits at the end of the game and holy shitballs it really looks like there were more people involved in the making of this game than there are in an Avengers movie. The budgets for games are getting huge and they have to make that revenue somehow. If it is through selling access to cosmetics, then I guess it is what it is. 

To sum it up, I like this game a lot, at least what I have played of it so far. I took my time with the campaign and completed it in ~20 hours while soaking in all of the cut scenes. That itself makes the price tag worth it to me and I do hope the fun factor continues in the post-campaign gameplay. I do hope that the dev's can get the bugs sorted out that are plaguing so many others so that they can have the chance to enjoy this game.",1599572109,1599572109,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197989874690,72,1,3607,4,1218,1601137076

Forget about its repetitive, tedious button mash brawl missions with no meaning or thrill behind them, forget about the 20 second boss fights, the unbearable lootbox system, the $15 per emote purchases, the whopping 2 player max multiplayer lobby, the shoe-horned platforms throughout every level, forgot about all its mediocrity LETS TALK ABOUT THE CRASHES. The moment I progressed far enough thru campaign to when multiplayer co-op becomes available, the game becomes UNPLAYABLE! I literally mean I can't play this game, it crashes so frequently in weird ways I've never seen a game do before, always something to do with pressing menu. I have to task manager out of the game every 20 to 30 minutes and I lose any progress during that mission. I could go on about why I hate this game but it wont get my $60 back and I'm intent on not wasting any more money with Disney. For this is the most expensive 10 hours of gameplay in my life, it will sit in my library forever uninstalled, a relic to serve me as a reminder to why you never buy a full priced game on launch day.

The game itself is a lot of fun! Combat feels good and satisfying and the story is not bad. Nothing close to Witcher or anything, but still very solid and has good character development. But playing this game, you can tell story is not the core of the game. Its the loot and end game. Looting is by far the highlight of this game for me. Some of my favorite games being Warframe and POE, when I saw a loot system in this game, I knew I was gonna love it and I do. I can see my self sinking over 100 hours in this game just so I can have all the characters max level and max power level. And me being a huge marvel nerd just makes this all better

The only thing I don't like about the game is the polish and performance. The game has some bugs in it, nothing game breaking from my experience, but some that are annoying like enemies spawning inside the floor and some not spawning at all. I believe that stuff will be patched out soon though. The other thing is performance. I am running a RTX 2070 Super, 32gb of ram, and a I7 9700k and I run the game on high and avg 100-120 frames witch is great, but the frames are never steady. I will randomly drop down to 70 and even 30 fps for no good reason. Shouldn't be loading issues either since I have this loaded up on an SSD. Maybe they will fix that but I'm not sure when.

Conclusion, game is great but needs some polish. I would still recommend this game even with the current performance problems, especially if you love Marvel like myself.

4,75639276,english,"Ok, let me preface this: This is clearly a game that combines Destiny style grind with the Marvel universe. And that's a great thing; exactly the kinda thing I'd want, actually. And while I will certainly keep playing the game myself, there are a few things that need to be said as to why this is actually a mediocre-bad game that I simply can't recommend.

First of all the technical issues. I didn't expect the game to run on ultra high for me, don't have the specs, dialed tons of stuff down. Still works ok for the most part, although it certainly is very demanding of my PC. The environments have occasional pop-ins, which I can handle and sometimes the textures look straight-up ass, but again, it's manageable.

What isn't acceptable, though, is the crashing. I updated my drivers (for other reasons, that will follow), took a few options that were recommended by my GPU down even more and yet I still had to spend like 2 hours this morning replaying the same mission over and over, because it kept crashing around 30 seconds before it'd end. So I had to keep tweaking settings, restarting my PC and playing to the same stupid spot over and over, until I found the right configuration that didn't crash me in only that exact spot.

Mind that I played like 6 hours without crashes til then, but something in that moment (probably spawning in 20 enemies at the same time) completely ripped the game to shreds.

Then there's the minor thing with the controller, which is quite annoying, although easily fixable. Basically you can't use your controller like for 95% of all the other games that accept a controller, you need to literally turn the controller off through Steam, so the GAME recognizes your controller and can use it. While we're on minor things, the startup forces you to press start again on a different menu screen (not accepting controller input) so if you just wanna boot up the game and sit back, get ready to stand back up, click one time with your mouse and then sit back down. (As I said, this one's really minor)

From technical issues to graphics: Overall I like the environments. They're lush jungles, stony canyons and lots of industrial/future/IT server tech stuff. BUT: If you actually wanna enjoy looking at this, get ready to make a whole filter for the game. The game itself seems to pull the shades down on the gameplay, so everything looks hazy and dark. It's a real shame, because under that mask the colors look really pretty in most locations. (That's why I needed to go through the whole driver installation thing for custom game filters from Nvidia)

Another thing is at first obvious, but at second glance atrocious. The faces are obviously not the ones you're used to and that's sort of ok. I can understand they can't get the likeness. What I can't understand, is why these characters sometimes look like the most lifeless horror you can imagine. When Tony (who looks like a 20 year old with an arc reactor sticker glued on his shirt without the suit) first puts on his red and gold suit and tells Jarvis ""How do I look"" his face is completely dead. There's no emotion there at all; it's like you're looking at a ventriloquist dummy.

Bruce occasionally just shaves his beard and instantly has it back in a few minutes, sometimes the camera decides to go WEEEEE during cutscenes and just randomly point at the ground or jumpscare you with a character's face for 0.25 seconds and while a lot more minor, there are tons of clipping issues and occasional hair issues as well as doors just randomly flashing between red and grey.

To clarify, in order to be fair I compared these issues to someone playing on max settings and even that guy crashed during one fight; not just crashing the game, but needing to restart the actual PC/Login.

Side note for the story: So far it's ok. It's the typical melodrama, just with awkward pauses during some lines and with an atrociously annoying teenage protagonist, that I couldn't identify with at all. A minor gripe for me was the intro, where we see her powerless (which is fine), then fast-forward a few years and now she has powers. Yes, the game explains/hints HOW she got those powers, but I really wanted to see her realize she had those. How she first used them, how her father reacted, how she secretly trained to get better use of it; stuff like that. As someone who doesn't read the comics I was just wondering why I was playing Luffy all of a sudden.

The combat on the other hand is mostly pretty fun. The gear stuff is very overwhelming at first and there are so many vendors and currencies and subtasks and skill trees, that it takes a bit to get into it, but it's enjoyable. You get a handy ""where the heck am I"" button, which is almost necessary sometimes, because the camera or level design doesn't always work perfectly and sometimes where you need to go is a little hidden/unintuitive.
Only issues with combat are that lock-on seems to arbitrarily get lost sometimes, parry windows vary wildly (which is just a skill thing, so ok) and my biggest issue: Flying enemies and ranged bois. God, do I hate these abominations. A single shot, no matter how small, is enough to rip you out of your attack chain and these gun enemies are mostly speckled throughout the wave, so you can't really utilize the cool parries, because you're stuck running after that one guy with a gun, so you can actually fight the bigger guys without getting nipped in the ankle. Some of these guys are full-on purple and just teleport in circles, which can prolong fights an annoying amount of time.

So yeah. Overall, I will absolutely keep playing and fight my way through the crap to enjoy the little nugget of fun hidden in here, but I simply cannot recommend this game to other players. If they were to fix a lot of these tiny bugs and issues and make your movements feel a little more fluid, that'd sway me to a recommendation, but as it stands, this game just isn't very good.",1599558754,1599558754,False,5,0,0.506135880947113037,0,True,False,False,76561198042531025,198,12,1390,0,602,1599994187

The only reason I am playing it despite the warnings of everyone else is due to the campaign story. Gameplay is alright, not as bad as everyone’s describing it to be. I do wish the loot would in some way alter the looks of my character though.

Regarding enemy diversity, I can see where they are going with this. I am almost certain that they will be adding more “groups” of enemies, eg. Asgardian enemies, magical enemies, cosmic enemies, etc. As of now most of them are robots due to the fact that we are fighting AIM, so if they keep their promise of free content expansions in the future, we will hopefully be seeing a much more diverse set of enemies as the narrative progresses.

All in all, lots of potential. The team behind this game seems to genuinely care for it and hopefully they keep their words and fix everything as soon as they can.

Being able to pick between the different Avengers is very nice, and each one does feel different, with their own mechanics and abilities. Levels are generally wide-open, and co-op is a blast to play.

Unfortunately, the game does have downsides.

26,75635348,english,"I'm going to throw my two cents in here. 

The game is... fine.
Gameplay is quite fun. Gameplay is similar to something like Marvel's Ultimate Alliance. However with a much smaller roster. The upside to this is that each character feels unique. The Hulk is big and uses rage to keep fighting through taking heavy hits. Iron Man switches between Repulsors, Lasers, and Missiles to adapt to pretty much any type of enemy. Black Widow excels at counter moves and one on one. Even though half the character Ultimates are just making the character bigger (ie turning them into the Hulk for a bit)
Probably the only game that has made Iron Man fun to play aside from VR games.

Story is pretty good. It has its hits and misses. The story itself is really good. The reason why I'd say it's a 7 out of 10 instead of higher is because of major pacing issues and how scenes often struggle to move to next in an organic way. Characters are fun, with decent motivations. Overall, it feels similar to watching Avengers 1 or 2. Good, if not overly complex fun.

Audio/Music is fairly lacking. Music is decent. Its good that it sets the tone for the game, without lacking quality or adding in themes that don't fit. However it's completely uninspired. You won't remember a single track for the entire game.
Sound effects are pretty terrible. Aside from the thunk of melee attacks hitting enemies, anyways. Those are pretty satisfying. And 'some' explosion sounds.
Everything else is lackluster. Thor's hammer sounds like it's made out of plastic. Black Widow's guns sound like they're firing BB's. The biggest issue is mainly a lack of detail. Let me try to explain. Characters mainly make footstep noises when they walk. You'd expect a little more. Maybe clinking of chainmail when Thor runs. Or clicking of snaps and stretching of leather when Black Widow or Cap America move.
The biggest one that made me realize all this was with Iron Man. You'd expect to hear the clicking and grinding of plates and armor sliding and snapping into place as he maneuvers around. But there's almost nothing. It makes everything feel much weaker and cheaper than it really is.

Then there's the loot system. It's serviceable. Not good, not bad. It feels like they just slapped it onto a game that didn't originally have plans to be a games as a service thingymajiggy. Which leads me to...

This game is obviously the stretched and twisted body of a different game forced into the pale imitation that we see now.
Most likely it was meant to be a singleplayer focused experience with a solid story that would hit the same beats as the movies. Probably something extremely similar to the Ultimate Alliance games, but with a tighter focus. Most likely it would have a multiplayer element where you could play with your friends if you wanted and possibly some small side missions here or there.
You can see this in the way the story is presented. You'll have fully cinematic cutscenes and handcrafted level design one mission, and then the next mission will have nothing but a simple voice over and a re-used hallway, maybe even an entire re-used mission area, in it's entirety.
You can also see how originally, gear was meant to have different cosmetic appearances. You can see this in how characters in the gear screen will move their body parts and center the camera to show off the ""visuals"" as you select each type of gear. Visuals that aren't there in the finished game. It's obvious that this was something that was changed in the late stages of development. This could've been due to the obvious reason, Square Enix wanted to give you an incentive to buy Skins by reducing the visual variety you could acquire for free. It could've also simply been a way to cut production costs by not having to make as many different character models. Either way the end result is pretty scummy.

So that was a wall of text that I didn't expect to write. Anyways, the game is fine. The framework is good enough that it can be patched and added to to become a good game, maybe even a great game. But right now it's just, ok. Not worth the 60 dollars. Maybe worth 40. Probably worth 30.",1599550123,1599550123,False,2,0,0.497925341129302979,0,True,False,False,76561198012680308,788,4,488,0,488,1599377774

29,75635142,english,"[b] The Good [/b]

I was skeptical when I played the beta. It was pretty buggy, the controls felt sluggish, and I didn't feel like a superhero when playing. 

But the full release is a different story. There are still some bugs and glitches here and there, but it now feels supremely satisfying. My attacks have weight behind them, and I realize it was really my lack of understanding when it came to the combat system that made everything feel lackluster. It isn't ""button mashy"" despite how others are describing it.

Once you spend some time with the characters and begin to figure out their each of their styles, you can get into what I'll describe as a flow state. Suddenly these pathetic minions can't touch you. Your attacks become second nature, and you feel a sense of supreme power as your movements begin to meld together in perfect unison. 

Your surroundings become a recreational parkour park of death as you flip, fly, hurdle and spin your way through your frustrated foes, teasing them as you destroy their villainous futures. 

The story is well crafted, and I find myself enjoying the moments of story exploration just as much as I enjoy the combat. The voice acting is fantastic. The music is heroic. The visuals are nothing short of breathtaking, especially when your ultimate abilities are unleashed. It truly feels like you are rumbling around as your favorite childhood super. 

[b]The Bad [/b]

The game is still buggy as mentioned above. While I haven't experienced the crashing issues others have mentioned, I have these infuriating moments of stuttering, as if the game was still struggling to load in your surroundings. It feels as though the game is in desperate need of a proper shader cache. This will no doubt be patched out eventually, and only serves as a minor inconvenience, but it's there nonetheless.

I didn't really like how slowly they rolled out the different aspects of combat. 4 hours into the campaign and I'm learning basic moves from the combat training simulator. BUT, I do like how you can level to attain new combos with increasingly devastating effects. I just felt a little spoon fed at times with how little the game reveals to you as far as basic combat goes.

The last negative I can think of is the Playstation exclusive Spiderman character. What a terrible concept. Sony, please realize that creatively, your company is trash, and can't even make a decent movie without Marvel's help. So start playing ball so the rest of us don't have to continue suffering the fact that you own the rights to Spiderman. Stop ruing my childhood favorite and let us all enjoy what was literally created for us. 

[b] Conclusion [/b]

Despite a few issues, this game has really surprised me. It feels hand crafted and made with nerd love. I'm impressed, though I have heard the game gets repetitive in the endgame portion. But I can't really think of a multiplayer game that doesn't get repetitive, so I think people simply expect too much sometimes. This isn't a game where you want to race to the end. Breathe it in. Be in the moment. Become an avenger.

35,75634695,english,"Its good enough for me to recommend, however you should still wait to buy it, because it will be better later. There are tons of issues, and parts that just feel bad, that they have stated they are looking into changing.

Just completed the main campaign. And based on playtime that took 18 hours. I had a great time the story is simple but still fun, and each hero is unique and fun to use. 
However there are a ton of issues in the game still. I ran into a few bugs, but those weren't really that detrimental to me. Despite each heroes abilities being fun and cool, a lot of the enemy encounters that aren't part of the main campaign are garbage. It feels like they didn't do gameplay testing as a solo player. There are missions where you need to protect 3 AI, but your companions don't do anything other than sit at the center killing a few people and in the time it takes you to get one enemy off one of the AI, another will be at half health. So there are several encounters like this, you can just defend one person and still complete the mission but you can't get a five star rating and it just feels bad.
There is a decent amount of enemy variety, however with that, there are lots of issues with some encounters not really being balanced well. Especially playing solo, you will often be combod and insta-killed, mostly due to ranged attacks that deal the same amount of damage as giant mechs that you need to dodge 5 times before it will stop tracking you (should only be 1 time imo). Your companions are just there to res you pretty much, though they only will do it twice for some dumb reason. Because enemies can combo with each other you will need to take cover, and find health often as a solo player, but your companions are too dumb to hold an obj while you do so. I hope they do a better job of balancing some of this solo play in the future.

Oh how I was wrong. The post-game content so far from launch is immense! 24 hours so far, i have only completed one or two side quests and half of the harm training rooms (during the main story). There is at least 10-15+ hours extra and I still see no end in sight. The quests/objectives it provides are like mini-stories which perfectly nudges you to play more and more.

The combat in this game is frustrating and unpredictable. You never know what your gonna get. Aerial attacks feel undodgeable most of the time leaving you to just take the attacks. Blocking feels unsatisfying, where in other games it feels amazing when your able to dodge or block an attack. The characters feel terrible, each one feeling floating or feeling like your doing 0 damage to BASIC enemies. Every death I have feels unfair. Honestly the game play is the worst part of it. Though Ms. Marvels writing is awful and I hate using the word Mary Sue but it accurately describes her as a character. She does get a little less annoying as the story goes on though. Honestly if you like this game good on you but I personally can barely stand to play it.

Customization (Combat) 9/10 - Loads of fun and lots to change and build upon even though its simple
Customization (Visual) 7/10 - Really cool outfit designs but only full outfits and there is a paid shop for some of them

Missions 7/10 - Have a variety of different objectives and sub missions but some how they feel the to simple and nothing new.
Bugs 5/10 - I have seen lots of visual glitches and some in cut scenes but not many, some missions bugged out and couldnt complete besides a restart, Also a few crashes to desktop as well. For a AAA game this is to many bugs.

It is true that clearly a lot of love went into the presentation aspects, and the story is decent I guess... but wow this game sucks as a single player experience.

Don't get this game for its single player content... and this is from someone who has played destiny 2 solo on and off for years without many complaints (though yeah I only check in when a story expansion hits and is on sale)

The difficulty in the Avenger's single player campaign is uneven and switches between trivial and unfair depending... largely on luck and how the AI has managed crowd control on a given run.

Even in the short campaign you spend FAR too long in the same corridors and ""Utah"" outdoors maps (the others get a bit tired too but not as much).   Strongly reminds me of Dragon Age II that way but without similar story payoff.  The general tasks you have to do to collect various chests in the environment start out annoying and get no better.

Abomination vanishing, enemies vanishing and then making your game crash with no error message, just sending you to your desktop.
After trying and trying to do a mission to continue with the multiplayer story, doing hives, bosses, elite and everything. You cant even complete it cause you keep crashing. It all happened with the Hotfix or because we only have 1 server, honestly i dont know. But right now the game its unplayable and if you recomend other people to buy it, you are crazy.
Devs dont talk to us, they dont tell us "" YES we know the random crash is ruining your game experience and we are gonna fix it"". There is nothing. 

I keep playing the game cause i like marvel and i try to do my dailies and weekly so i dont fall behind, but other than that , there is nothing i can do if i crash every time i want to do a mission.

I had no issues during the early access, ive played with friends , no bugs, no problems , nothing. Luckily i was one of the few people that experienced 0 important bugs.

But thoses crashes are ruining my experience. So no , do not waste your money on this game. Not yet at least. If they fix it , if there wont be more issues like this , then only they buy it.

The game is worth 60 bucks if everything gets fixed, but right now the only thing that works is the single player story mode and for that charging 60 bucks is crazy.

97,75628898,english,"The bottom line is: the game is fun. 

In my personal experience with the game thus far I have run into minimal bugs and only one crash, and while the downtime between high octane battles can be somewhat diminished by this lack of polish, all that fades away once you get back to the action.

The combat actually has more depth then it seems at first glance, and you’ll find that anyone calling it a simple button masher are also the ones complaining about how impossible it is once there are more than 4 enemies. Every character has a role they fill on the battlefield, and it’s a role they can only fill by optimizing the usage of all their abilities. Stick to your strengths, prioritize your targets, and you’ll find that even a few dozen enemies don’t stand a chance.

The story was actually far more engaging than it had any right to be. In this post MCU world, I’m surprised the plot was able to be even remotely unique. That being said, there’s still enough classical inspiration here that every marvel fan will be able to enjoy the little references, be you an MCU enthusiast or comic book diehard. On top of that, the voice acting is pretty phenomenal. In both cutscenes and in idle interactions, the characters ooze personality.

Ok, time for the bad stuff

 There is a general lack of polish. Some of the many glitches I’ve found include:

-Ms. Marvel’s arm stretching out and never retracting (only visible to teammates)
-Cap’s eyeball floating a good two inches in front of his face during an otherwise super serious cutscene.
-Two Thors and two Hulks spawning after my teammate dropped out of the game.
-Unlocked skins re-locking themselves but still being usable (kinda)
-Singular particles randomly orbiting my character for a few seconds

For the most part, these glitches don’t affect the actual gameplay, but certain ones like the skins re-locking are incredibly annoying (thankfully the devs have taken notice of that one and are working to fix it).

Other than that, then menus are pretty cumbersome and downright dysfunctional in certain places such as the challenge card menu. On top of that, a lack of streamlining across the board makes certain experiences way longer than they need to be, such as the lack of an easy way to dismantle large amounts of gear or the fact that the mini-open-worlds have no map, only waypoints. WAYPOINTS THAT DISAPPEAR UNLESS YOU PRESS V EVERY 7 SECONDS WHILE JARVIS KEEPS YELLING AT YOU TO CARRY ON WITH THE MAIN MISSION. I KNOW ABOUT THE MAIN OBJECTIVE YOU ARTIFICIAL IMBECILE, I’ll GET AROUND TO IT ONCE I'M DONE GETTING THIS TREASURE CHEST!

ok, ok, I’m calm. Let me get back to the positive.

All in all, if you find the gameplay loops of games like Destiny or Diablo satisfying and you’re a fan of the Avengers, you can’t really go wrong with getting this game. The story is great, every character feels like they should, and when it’s not glitching, the game can be quite pretty. The only precaution I would take, and it is a pretty major one, is to make sure your computer can even run the damn thing. Apparently a lot of people have been experiencing frequent crashes, and while I’ve not been having the same issue, I still recognize that that’s a pretty huge red flag, especially at $80 CAD. However, if you are reading this from a future where the game has been mostly fixed, then I’d say definitely pick it up.

99,75628858,english,"Let me start out by saying I liked the game. I'm a big marvel guy so there is a bit of bias, but I'm trying to review this from the perspective of someone who isn't a super big marvel fan and just wants to play a cool superhero game. This game's optimization is absolutely horrid. Frequent bugs, crashes, glitches, and visual errors. On 2 different occasions my screen became completely white as if it were tv static, leading me to close the game and lose all my progress on the missions. I've had about 6 different crashes. Now even though it is 3 days after launch as of the time of this review, not only did they have a beta with the same problems, but this game came out 3 days early for those who spent $80. There is no way they didn't know about these issues.

The frame rate is also extremely inconsistent. Sometimes it was crystal clear and great quality and sometimes it devolved into a slideshow. Even the cutscenes were struggling to play properly with lip syncing issues and frame drops (I've learned that this game really hates to render hair in as well). It's so disappointing too because under this buggy, poorly optimized mess is a potentially amazing Avengers game. When the game is actually running properly and you're with your team infiltrating facilities and turning robots to scrap, it's amazing. The combat is such good ""turn your brain off and smash"" kind of fun, but the experience is ruined for me because of the optimization. For example, I would've loved the final mission if it wasn't consistently running 30 fps or lower. I would've thoroughly enjoyed this cinematic, epic finale if I wasn't constantly worrying about my game crashing. I myself am willing to forgive the lack of enemy variety and map settings, so long as the actual fighting is fun, but the bugs and fps are a deal breaker.

Now for some reason, they decided to take a ""Destiny"" approach with a power level and loot system. I'm also a fan of Destiny, but my god do they butcher this system. At least in Destiny, I get to see the visual effect of the loot I get. When you get a chest piece in that game, you put it on and you can visually admire it. In this game, you don't get that luxury. Gear and skins are 2 different tabs AND on top of that, to actually get cosmetic skins is a chore (Unless you shell out some money of course because it being a $60 buggy mess isn't enough). Now this could've been forgiven in my eyes IF THE SKINS WERE ACTUALLY WORTH IT. I don't know how they couldn't implement good skins with almost 81 years of comics to work off of. There are only a handful of skins you see that make you go ""oh, cool"", plus it shares that aspect of Apex/Overwatch skins where some of them are literally just recolors of the same skin. 

This game needed more development time, but they decided to release it half baked and just fix it as it goes along, like most ""live service"" games released this year. I recommend not getting this game as of right now and waiting until the frame rate issues, constant crashes, visual bugs, and etcetera are fixed. This game could be something great if the developers would just give it the time it needs.

Not a bad game at all. Campaign will run you roughly 10-15hrs, and there appears to be a lot of missions to tide ya over within the endgame content.

Visuals; beautiful game. Occasional visual oddity, especially after the launch day 1 patch. Pretty much the only bugs I got in the game... nothing breaking and the game has not crashed yet.

6 Heroes to start off with varying abilities and vastly different play styles. Keeps it fresh IMO and each one is fun to play and contributes in their own way.

Pros:
-The game is entertaining, and the campaign story is good. 

Cons:
-The amount of random disconnections is absurd.
-After being done with the campaign the grind is slow and extremely repetitive (even if the missions are supposedly different objectives)
-With the campaign you won't level much, and the ""power"" of the characters starts to be around lvl 25. So you need to grind a lot to feel decently powerful. 
-A lot of graphic problems, the image will stutter, the fight will continue, and when it comes back you'll find yourself dead.
-A lot of collision issues and bugs, example, you need to kill 5 enemies, toss 1 enemy against the wall and he is now untargetable and you can't advance. 

If you wait for ALL these technical issues to be fixed, to the state that is playable and enjoyable, it might be worth purchasing, if you don't mind the grind.

But seriously... you're the best! Give this game a huge pass until they fix more of the extreme game breaking issues. It truly is a frustrating mess on PC. The engaging and enjoyable combat is just not enough to offset the frequent and destructive bugs this game faces.

The combat overall is amazing with each hero bringing a lot to the table without feeling like they get too repetitive, though there's some nitpicks with a few mobs and how much ranged there is at times but that may be addressed in time. Lots of different cosmetic skins/costumes for each character is great if somewhat letdown by the fact that most tend to be 3-4 types then like 5 recolors of those.  The UI itself can be clunky and at times not good at showing important information but here's hoping this gets addressed over time...especially the loot system which is a jumbled mess. Iconic hero missions need work, they're short and pretty pointless and are a huge missed opportunity. Hopefully we'll start seeing a bit better world building outside that, too :)

The levels end up getting rather bland (though a few standouts, can we have more like Manhattan? lol)
 and samey quickly once you get far enough into the story then start doing multiplayer content which seems pretty anemic atm with what's overall offered. There is supposed to be a roadmap soon as to post launch content (besides some of the already announced heroes) so while the multiplayer can be fun it may get old fast until we can get some additional content and bug fixes, but here's hoping!

The game is a lot of fun and it looks GORGEOUS (even on my GTX 970,) and I hope it has a bright future as it gets content updates. I do recommend it but with the caveat that if you're looking for a long time mutliplayer game, it will depend on post launch updates to tell if it's going to really have staying power!

57,75443089,english,"I knew virtually nothing about this game before I bought it. I just jumped in and took a risk.

[b]At this point I have cleared the story as well as the secondary ""multiplayer"" campaign. I find I can't recommend it. Yet...[/b]

The single player story, seems pretty bug free. Or was for me. However side missions and the post game content started to have issues, regularly that broke the gameplay session. 

b]I do not find reloading from a checkpoint a viable gameplay mechanic.[/b] However, that was the only way I could salvage some of my effort without rage-quitting once game-breaking bugs appeared. 

Also I noticed a bit late that there are not many BOSSES to fight. And they don't appear much at all. Marvel has many historic bad guys, but none of them really appear! We get about 2-3 bosses, that show up once or twice. That is it. That is lame.

I've started to see more crashes now too. Which is painful. A lot more.

Here are the bugs I started to experience the following:
[list]
[*]CTD with no error message, several times
[*]Texture issues making characters look like they had their faces painted black
    [*]audio bugs where sound effects did not exist
    [*]character's heads popping through the ground...i guess they fell through the floor
   [*]Multiple occasions where required enemies would fall through floor, or a wall and become stuck and unable to be defeated. Forcing you to either restart the mission or load from a checkpoint to start over and hope they don't do it again. Losing 20 minutes of progress.
[*]A store merchant that would not let you exit the menu unless you purchased something. No button inputs would allow you to escape the forced purchase, even though you already visited this exact merchant just hours earlier.
[*]AI companions getting stuck and either floating forever in place or not being able to walk over a rock
[*]NPC repeating the same line of dialog back to back dozens of times in a row
[*]UI updates sticking on the screen for 5 minutes instead of going away after a few seconds
[*]Daily/Weekly assignments not always updating as expected (restarting often fixed this)
[*]And more stuff I've forgotten at this point

Outside of the bugs, I have now experienced the real grind too. Not worth my time. The loot grind on your first character isn't bad if you are using them for the main story and Avengers Inititive. But any secondary characters are going to be tedious to do. There isn't enough mission variety or map diversity to really to do redo 40-50 hours of effort with 6 characters.

But if you want to use your AI buddies effectively, they will need to be leveled up and have gear to survive. And at least right now AI is more reliable than getting matchmaking working.

Regarding the Challenge Cards, it will take weeks or even months to unlock some trivial color swaps. Many agree you get the best outfits from the story, so the ""battle pass"" like cards won't be very exciting to everyone. 

I am done with the game for now. But will try out new characters as they are released.

[h1]Below is my experience from the story which I did enjoy a lot.[/h1] 

[b]I beat the main story in about 13 hours and felt it was mostly well done.[/b]
It was enjoyable, had some funny moments, good visuals, some exciting scenes, good action and overall it went smoothly. I had fun mashing buttons, beating people down, breaking stuff and falling to my death. All the things I would expect in a super hero game.

[b]Good:[/b]
[list]
    [*]Environment and Character Art are very good
    [*]Animations look great and many are a pleasure to see over and over again
[*]Characters feel good to control, for the most part. They have good mobility and satisfying attacks
    [*]Straight-forward gameplay where you can mostly shut off your brain and watch stuff explode (if you want)
[*]Story is entertaining enough to encourage you to push through it without dragging on too long
[*]There are optional side quest chains for each hero, so you can ignore certain characters if you want ^_^ while also still being able to spend dedicated time with the heroes you like more (instead of waiting for post-game)
[*]The heroes personalities are portrayed pretty well, and their dialog exchanges match my expectations of their relationships and history
[/list]

[b]Maybe Not so Good:[/b]
[list]
    [*]Very Familiar gameplay... might get boring sooner than later because its the same stuff we've done in every other game
[*]The characters are actually pretty similar gameplay wise, not completely, but kinda sorta. It's not a bad thing, but I would like if new characters end up being more risky and unique. 
    [*]No Spiderman... I know, I get it. Still hurts.
    [*]Tiny starting cast compared to the full potential Marvel roster may limit appeal. 
[*]The unlockables aren't very exciting, They use the standard cookie-cutter format. Get more colors, useless badges and such. ZZZ. There are some good cosmetics, but most are forgettable/similar unless you just want to collect everything.
[*]The unlockables will take considerable amount of time to unlock...
[*]The game is designed in such a way that you are expected to play daily for years to come...but the content doesn't seem worth it.
[*]Daily activities, challenge cards, factions all feel like busy work we've done before

Pros: 
6 characters each fleshed out with their playstyle, backstory, and abilities.
Future characters will be free
Future regions will be free
No pay to win
A 4+ hours long campaign told through the eyes of Ms. Marvel who works to act as the glue of The Avengers
Good amount of cosmetics that can be earned through gameplay

Cons:
Only 3 skill trees per playable character
Somewhat repetitive combat
Getting hit while dodging
Getting stun locked because dodging has no I-frames at all
Fairly underwhelming boss fights both in campaign and multiplayer
Battlepass can be a bit annoying to grind challenges for

Skill trees were as complex as i hoped, allowing you to completely change up your style of play being able to switch in between two specializations or mastery unlocks that really affect your character with it sometimes completely changing the ability all together. Not to mention you can switch it any time. Contrary to popular belief, i think a lot of fun can be had with the combat. I just think it's one of those situations where it might not be fun to watch which could hurt streamers, but I've had a great time with everything that has to do with combat,  using different combos, chucking a shield or hammer, not to mention the ability unlocks you can acquire. In my opinion, the game was totally worth it for me and with content coming already in October, the future is looking bright for this game to me. If it's not you're type of game, that's completely fine but don't call it shit and confuse the people who might be interested.

While its a decent game for a fan, i think if your not a superhero fan already going in, your going to dislike it right off the bat, thats a given. The overall gameplay loop gets boring, the loot doesnt change the look of your character and so feels slightly unsatisfying, as your just watching numbers grow bigger. The combat while kool when it works, does leave you feeling very ""un-super"" for a hero, every hit on you interrupts you, so often times you can get 1/4 the way through your super awesome combo, only to be knocked out by a regular joes ranged attack that wasnt even telegraphed.

66,75623385,english,"Let me start off by saying I love playing this game. The combat is fun, every character plays different so there's plenty of variety, and the talents make it that much better. The main reason I can't recommend this game is simply because of all the bugs.

Some are minor bugs, like cosmetics getting locked which can be fixed be relogging or Cap's eyeballs popping out of his head in a horrifying manner. These are no big deal.

It's the major bugs, like the infinite loading screen of death or the really bad memory leak the game has that will start chugging your frames like an alcoholic after about an hour of gameplay in single or multiplayer. While closing out of the game and relaunching it does fix this, it only works for another hour until the game becomes unplayable again. 

It's a really fun game with huge potential, especially with all the heroes they have lined up down the line that you'll get for free (though their cosmetics are locked behind a $10 battle pass) but until the memory leaks and loading screens are fixed, you should save your money. On the bright side they do actually seem to care about this game and are responding to almost everyone on their twitter, so if you do get this game and find a bug, let them know.

Marvel's Avengers is a game I've been lookin' forward to since the announcement in 2017, and so far, I've been really happy with what I have.

Each character plays differently that you would want to switch back and forth between them (Personal favorite is Cap, he's a beast). The game has enough content to keep you busy for a few days (grinding out the challenge cards is hard but rewarding to do).

The cast is great, Kamala Khan being a Avengers fangirl makes us connect with her, as a Marvel fan. Her relationship with Bruce is sweet and is a fun dynamic and you really root for them. 

The rest of the cast, from Tony to Steve, all fit their roles perfectly, Nolan North as Tony Stark was actually kinda surprisingly good, After a while, you stop hearing  Nathan Drake and he really becomes Iron man (also I like the fact that this version of Tony has a lot more backbone to his character.)

94,75610298,english,"The Great:

The voice acting and music are fantastic in this game. I do have a problem with the way some of the characters look (Ant-Man and Black Widow) I thought most of the voices fit the characters on screen surprisingly well. I don’t mind the designs of everyone like I thought I would when they were first announced. Tony Stark carried the campaign until I unlocked Captain America. The music feels like something out of the MCU and is backed by some excellent voice acting. The sound effects are really good too. Iron Man probably sounds the best out of everyone else in the game.

The way his repulsors sound makes me nerd out every single time I hear them. Thor has a big booming voice as you would expect him to while Captain America sounds like I always imagined he would. This is probably the best sounding game I’ve played all year.

The Good:

Gameplay:

Marvel’s Avengers has 6 playable characters and every one of them plays very differently than each other, but none of them plays as well as other heroes from their own games. For starters, the lock-on mechanic is broken and doesn’t work. Enemies regularly dodged out of lock-on and I would have to repeatably click the middle mouse button to lock on again. I eventually gave up on the locking on to enemies and just wailed on everything around me until they were all dead. The gameplay here is… very hit and miss. It’s not as tight as games like Spider-man and the Arkham series, but it’s not terrible either.

The problem is the lack of skills. Games like Ultimate Alliance and X-men Legends (yeah that’s an old one) gave you plenty of skills at your disposal and let you build your heroes to your specific tastes. While you can do that somewhat here it’s a far cry from other superhero games that have come before it. Every character only gets 3 skills and they take a while to charge up for another use. You can’t spam powers here like you could in the Ultimate Alliance games so you’ve got to use them wisely. Ultimate attacks are cool looking though.

Every character in this game plays differently than each other and have different combos that you can chain together in combat. It’s basically like Dynasty Warriors. Press (insert controller or mouse button here) x amount of times and then press Y (or F) for a heavy attack that finishes your combo. It’s all very clunky if I’m completely honest here. The aerial combat is… not good in this game. It’s serviceable, but it’s a far cry from what Anthem did. Yes, Anthem. Anthem lacked a lot of things, but the gameplay wasn’t one of them.

The game is fun though. Especially the campaign. Some of the story setpieces gave me strong Tomb Raider vibes while the forced stealth segments annoyed the crap out of me. The boss fights ranged from “this is cool!” to “oh look! Another fucking robot”. The campaign was all over the place but ended on a good note, had good acting, good setpieces, and decent boss fights.

After I completed the campaign I decided to tackle the multiplayer stuff and it was as generic as I thought it would be. Fans of Destiny might flock to this and enjoy it, but there’s simply not enough here for me to recommend this game to anyone right now. The gameplay itself can be serviceable, but when you’re surrounded by enemies and getting hit at all sides and constantly staggering from shit that shouldn’t stagger the Hulk! It gets annoying real fast.

My biggest issue with the game is the loot system. It’s half-assed and was ripped straight from Destiny. Why does every developer think that Destiny’s gear score system is good? It’s not. I would’ve preferred something similar to Diablo’s loot system to where we know exactly what is being boosted. All it boiled down to was me choosing whatever gear had higher numbers next to it to up my gear score so I can take on that one mission that required me to have 40 power. The gear doesn’t even change the way your character looks because all of the cosmetics are locked behind insane grinding or microtransactions.

Story:

In Marvel’s Avengers, you play as, well, the Avengers. Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Hulk, and Black Widow in a single campaign. Ms. Marvel (Kamala Khan) is the main character of the story and it mostly focuses on her throughout the 8-10 hour campaign. I was not a fan of Ms. Marvel when this game started. She was basically an annoying fangirl that bought nothing to the story being told.

The best story moments, for me anyway, was with the actual Avengers team doing Avengers shit. Iron Man and Captain America had the most memorable moments throughout the whole campaign while Ms. Marvel felt like an unwanted tag along for most of it. Tony Stark was by far the most interesting character in the game. He was funny, witty, and had all of the best lines of dialogue and they were delivered perfectly by Nolan North while Ms. Marvel whined most of the time. I don’t see what everyone sees in her. She did have some moments towards the end of the game, but that didn’t take away her constant fangirling and whining for the first 60% of the campaign though.

Graphics:

Marvel’s Avengers can look really good sometimes. And most of the time it looks like a late-era 360 and PS3 game. The character models are… very early gen looking. The hair on everyone looks horrible and low res. Some environments can look really good while most of the time it’s very plain and average looking. I don’t like the art style they chose to go with in this game. Not everything has to be super realistic looking. I would’ve loved a more unique style. They could’ve made this game look like a comic book or went with a nice cel-shaded art style over… this. Avengers isn’t an ugly game, but it’s far from what I would call a great looking game.

There are some graphical options here (Ambient Occlusion, Antialiasing, shadows, etc), but nothing on the scale of Gears 5 or even Doom Eternal. The PC port of this game is… alright. It’s not the best performing PC game out there and it’s not the worse.

The performance is all over the place in this game. I rarely stayed at 60 FPS throughout my 19 hours of playtime. I even crashed a few times, but I’ll get more into that in the negative section of this review.

The Bad:

Bugs & Glitches

I’ll admit that this game was not as buggy as I was expecting it to be. The “beta” was buggy as shit and did not work for me at all. It got so bad that I uninstalled the game and wrote about it. I crashed a few times and my FPS was all over the place, but it ran much better than it did during the “beta”. If my FPS was at 60 it immediately dipped back down to the mid 40s. This game is not optimized very well at all.

It’s Super Repetitive:

After the campaign ended I became incredibly bored with this game. The “end game” nothing, but small instanced missions with the dumbest objectives in this genre. Stand in this really tiny circle to fill up a meter while trying to beat the shit out of dozens of enemies spawning around you. Defend points A, B, C, and D while killing dozen of enemies that try and capture them from you. The objectives of these missions are really repetitive and boring. Especially when you’re by yourself. I mentioned before that this game felt like a free to play game. I still feel that way. It’s a free to play game that cost $60. The campaign is worth playing through, but it’s not a $60 campaign by any means.

If you don’t like doing the exact same thing over, and over, and over then you should know what you’re getting into here. This game is Anthem, Destiny, and Warframe, but not as fun as any of those games in my opinion. Especially with all the bugs this game currently has.

Marvel's Avengers will no doubt continue to grow and, hopefully, get better, but I can't recommend this game to anyone right now. It's not worth $60. Once some quality of life patches release for the game and some more content I'll have no problem turning this into a positive review.

Graphics - 
I'll get this out of the way.  the game is pretty beautiful.  i'm only playing at 1080p and its still beautiful (maxed out settings with GTX1080)

Story - 
its ok i guess.  its hardly original though. pretty much a marvel movie in game form. i'm not being blown away.

Gameplay -
Somehow... they've managed to make being a superhero....boring?  not at first mind, the opening sequence in particular was very slick and was spot on. but i'm only 20% through the campaign and it now feels like a slog.  i guess i'm maybe really bad at the game because playing as hulk on normal left me wanting to smash my keyboard instead of more enemies i was dying so much.  playing on easy doesn't lower the mission rewards though so thats something.  The move sets are definitely different for each character and yet somehow the gameplay is just the same.  everyone has range and melee.  you need to use both. period. everyone has light and heavy attacks.  and the same combination of button presses to do stuff.  the stuff that plays out on the screen is different but it just feels...too similar somehow.  The skill system is pretty much a crap shoot.  No way to know if moves are any good unless you purchase them...but then you can't respec. i've purchased a few moves that look really cool but are essentially useless. The gear is still too much of a mystery and i haven't even seen anything above rare yet so i'll not pass comment on the loot/gearing system. so far its higher power = better every time

Overall -
I find myself closing down the game and not looking forward to the next mission, this isn't a good sign for someone who usually plays games obsessively until they are done and was really hoping to find a decent arpg campaign with an option on a not too annoying multiplayer.  I'll probably force myself to rush the campaign at some point just because of the price.

19,75618497,english,"Despite a somewhat rocky launch, this game is absolutely worth it in my personal opinion. any gamebreaking issues my friends and i found were patched out really quickly.

Graphics:
graphically, this game is stunning. It runs pretty well, though my pc cant handle max settings, the settings it can handle are honestly beautiful. everything from the lighting to the animations is just butter. 8/10

Story:
The story was engaging enough, it was well paced and nicely coherent. It wasn't a smash hit, but I still enjoyed it. 6/10

Gameplay:
The gameplay is so wonderfully fluid. I played through the game on Hard mode and it was a hell of a challenge. there were a few bits that felt like it was being a bit cheap as when you meet new enemies, it often leaves you to fend for yourself as far as learning their moves and mechanics goes. As I level up, though, I find that many of the enemies who gave me trouble are pretty simple once you get your timing for dodges and parries down. 8/10

Music:
The music is, unfortunately, the worst part of this game. It's not a horrible score, it's actually quite pleasant. My issue with it is that it's forgettable. its safe. It doesn't go out of its way to pull notes and melodies from other popular mediums such as the MCU. I would love if this score threw in some nice nods to the beautiful scores of the MCU, but instead it feels standard, bland, forgettable. 5/10

Multiplayer:
Multiplayer is handled quite nicely. while there are a large variety of technical bugs, its nothing horrible and gamebreaking. It's a great way to play with your friends post campaign. I cannot wait to see what content they add such as raids etc. 7.5/10 (worth noting: some of the campaign can be done multiplayer, but a sizeable 2/3rds is singleplayer only)

[u]The good[/u]:
- The campaign is solid (but short), story, cast and characters are great.
- Hero skill trees are good and rewarding
- You can fly with Iron Man or Thor.

[u]The bad[/u]:
- Spider-Man is not coming to PC.
- Combat is wonky 
- On PC, sometimes the buttons just doesn't react.
- AI teammates are dumb. 
- Missions are repetitive and boring.
- The grind for gear feels way too slow and unrewarding. 
-  Enemy projectiles sometimes go through walls and hit you, you cannot parry or dodge, half your HP is gone. 
- Last enemy fell through the floor, needed to restart the mission. 
- FPS drops, lag spikes, missing audio, low-res textures on some places.
- The number of costumes are misleading, most of them are just recolored versions. (Like Thors 'civilian' outfit, all the same he just have a different T-shirt). Hoped to see a variety like actual ones from the movie or comics. Some of the costumes are behind microtransactions.

My biggest problem is the combat system. Sometimes its really fun to play, but then things happen like when my level 15 Thor, with around 40 gear score, got down from two hits from a random AIM bot. AI revives me, looking around who to hit and... I'm down again, mission failed, restart. I know that the 40 gear score is not that great, but this was on EASY mode, and Challenge I. Every single small attack staggers you, stopping you to finish a combo or a charge attack. You start to spin up the Mjolnir, as the god of thunder, but a yellow suit dude with a jetpack shoots you in the back with a pea shooter and you are staggered... Same with the Hulk. Its fun when there is only 5-6 enemies around, but when you face more than that, the battle will be chaotic and sometimes you cant do anything, because you will be perma-stunned. It feels like the AI is only focusing on you. You wanna fly up from the battle, to support the team from above? 4-5 lasers immediately shoots you back to the ground.

For me, there is a line between fun and frustration, and this game in its current state sadly more frustrating than fun to play.

26,75617753,english,"This has to be one of the most disappointing games that I've bought. I thought it was going to be great because I love Avengers however, the people who worked on this game were SUPER LAZY.

I'll give a list of things that they were lazy on:
- First of all, the game mechanics and controls. (Keep in mind I'm talking about keyboard controls)
You can only dodge forward, left, right, and back. You can't even dodge to diagonally, for example forward towards the right, backwards to the left, etc. Also, they don't even give you an option to drop when  you're hanging from a ledge. Say you're jumping to get something on top of a ledge, however an object is blocking you from going up, you can't come back down. YOU ARE STUCK THERE. The only thing you can do is reload the checkpoint and hope you don't get blocked. The targeting system was also trash especially when you're the Hulk. Literally half his body is covering my vision even after using wide fov.
- Second, the different maps. There was almost no diversity in each mission that I did. It was the same map on each mission in one area of the world.
- Third, the missions. There was basically only a few objectives to do on side missions, and they are literally the same as the campaign. All you gotta do is either keep a checkpoint or destroy something while fending off enemies. Thats it, not much else.
- Fourth, the puzzles that need to be solved to get loot are flawed. Sometimes you have to shoot something or step on something however, sometimes the things  you need to step on ARE INSIDE THE LOOT ROOM WHICH YOU HAVE TO UNLOCK. WHAT IS THAT?
-Character models: these people look like they picked a random person out of the street with a 10% resemblance to what it should be. Honestly, they should've tried to make them look good.
-The formatting for missions is just not good. It doesn't feel like I'm doing much but following objectives. No impact

I am only recommending this game because I can not be bothered to come back a month or so  later to edit my review.

OVERALL: Look I am a DC fanboy but i have a soft spot for Marvel. I want to love this game I really do, the story is great, the characters grow on you, the game play.... its rough. You can obviously tell they tried to create a combat system much like the Arkham games but not outright rip them off. And that honestly hurts this game at its core. Either copy or create something new. In a nutshell combat is hitting light attacks and heavy attacks with some range and hit combos, parry, and dodge. But unlike Arkham the combat doesn't feel rewarding much less giving you that powerful feeling. The story is actually pretty well written and voice acted. I was honestly more invested in continuing the story only to find out more rather than to find loot or level up. 

LOOT: This is a looter game but most of the time the loot does not really feel like it matters at all sure some pieces have certain perks that will cause effects or bonuses but overall its just there to pick up. honestly for a second i thought i was playing Anthem...yea the loot is that pointless. 

CRASHES: My rig is not the most powerful in the world but its fine very basic actually. Typical i5 8th gen, GTX 1060 6GB blah blah so its should be fine at high you would think. Well yes and no what sucks about this is its very hard to benchmark this game because it doesn't have a tool to do so. In the end you have to mess around with the setting and see what you can work with. Anyways its not just me but many people have reported that the game will randomly crash or just shut off with no warning about why or how, just homescreen. And this game is buggy af my god i thought AC Unity had issues this game man. You can be in the War Table going through mission when all of a sudden you get yanked out to your character standing there (not game breaking i know but it gets old fast) 

ALL IN ALL: 5/10 PLAYABLE TO AN EXTENT, SEMI-ENJOYABLE, SOLID STORY
 I can not lie to you and say get this game now if your an Avengers fan. Yes they do the Avengers justice with their iconic looks and attitudes but jeez the game play, the bugs, the mobs, the audio, the rendering, the list is long and within each of those thing i listed there are subcategories of issues yes categories not just category.

75,75613803,english,"Oh look, a negative review that isn't from some neckbeard complaining about Ms. Marvel!

PROS: 
- the graphics are beautiful (when they function properly)
- the story is fun enough. If you've seen anything else that Disney has put out with the Avengers other than the MCU, you can call the plot point for point, but it's enjoyable enough.
- it's a little addictive, and there are genuinely moments when you sit back and go ""okay, that was awesome"" (there's an Iron Man scene in space that's just w o w)
- each Avenger definitely has their own combat style... once you figure out the combat system.
- cosmetics are cool, and the ones you can unlock for free (with some effort) are WAY better looking than the ones only available for real life money dollars.

CONS:
- the graphics do not function properly a good 40% of the time. Try uninstalling the HD texture pack after you spent an hour downloading it! It's frustrating!
- the start of this game is SLOW. If you're looking to just pick up and as your favorite Avenger, you might want to skip the campaign. You get a new core member almost every other chapter or so.
- non-intuitive combat, as noted above. I'm sure that you've heard it before in other reviews, but it takes a LOT of getting used to in order to know just what the heck you're doing. 
- this game REALLY wants you to buy credits. Every time I go to the Challenge Card section, it seems to click on BUY CREDITS, even if I was trying to go to Skills or Objectives, clear in the other corner.
- wonky camera controls. If you're playing with a mouse, this thing will twist and turn at the MOST inopportune times. Can't vet for the controller players, but for the point and click gang, this game can be pretty rough.
- there's no real way to level up your Avengers WITHOUT playing the HARM room or the same missions over and over again, at least in single player. Especially egregious because there are some higher level missions available pretty early on, and you think ""wow, okay, I guess I'm gonna be getting a lot of exp!"". You won't. There's a Hulk mission available as soon as you finish up his first one, and I'm STILL not leveled up enough to play it... and I played a LOT of Hulk.

Overall, the most damning thing about this game that I can say is that it's a very ""safe"" bet that has been hedged. There's nothing really new being offered here, gameplay wise or franchise-wide. This game, at least as of my 18 hours in not long after launch, is clearly put together with other games in mind. It's borrowed heavily from Disney's cache of Marvel story lines, 

HOPEFULLY this changes once we get some of that DLC content, and it's been around for a little while. But in its base state, Marvel's Avengers is hardly worth the price tag.",1599508834,1599508834,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198367626279,39,4,2744,9,1085,1601147596

92,75579300,english,"This is a no spoilers review:

I want to recommend this game, because honestly I've had a lot of fun with it. But its got some issues that honestly need to be addressed.

Pros:
-Really good Avengers story. 
I was honestly surprised and they gave a lot of heart to one of the newer Marvel Heroes Kamala Khan. She's really the heart of this entire story, and watching her heroes journey outside of her comic was an absolute joy.

-Design is on point. 
The costumes, and overall art direction is great. After having the MCU in our faces for years it was honestly refreshing seeing a different take. Though I will say Cap looks kinda like generic everyman, everyone else is great.

-Characters Feel different
All of them. Widow feels fast and Agile, Khan feels just good to play as she moves about, Hulk feels like a freight train just slowly building up momentum and crushing most anything in his path. Each of them feels like unique characters despite the similar light attack, heavy attack, ranged attack nature of the gameplay. Its really wonderfully done, and once you hit level 12-15 of a character and get to know their unique quirks and abilities? It all just meshes perfectly, and you feel like you're playing the character.

Cons:
-First few character levels feel like a chore
The first few levels, I want to say levels 1-5 are a bit of a grind. Your powers are not as strong, and the loot you get is ultimately forgettable. Once you get your specialties and more reliable Block breakers and parry/dodge counters you'll start feeling better about it. Levels 15-20 are the sweet spot once you start feeling good about your character.

- Hit indicators. 
For the most part they work. But damn if suddenly I'm hit by an unblockable missile out of nowhere, or some of that a hit indicator is obscured by one of the many particle or fire, or explosion effects.

-Quick Play
Quick play is a mixed bag. You get put into a group and can get a quick game on, but you can't choose who you play as, or any indicator of who you're going to play. Vermintide 2 has this fixed, in that a user's current character selection isn't available it brings up a menu. no drop in and drop out multiplayer in match, not an easy thing to program in, would be incredibly welcome.

-Bugs
There are quite a few bugs in this game primarily in multiplayer. I've seen Kamalas' arm stretch for literally hundreds of meters, and some weird artifacting on graphical textures on the main characters. But theses are just a small thing compared to the game breaking bugs either preventing progress  or outright crashing. In my career as a temp Avenger I've encountered the following:
+Crashes in Story Specific Missions for no reason (Primarily Captain America's Global Prescence)
+Repeated Enemy NPC's not spawning to allow completion of missions (Or seems to spawn only 3 out of the 5 Elite Squaad NPCs)

Overall, I do like this game. Its a wonderful story, and a great combat package. Its only marred by its current bugs, and quickplay/matchmaking issues. As it is, I'd wait either until a few patches down the line or a sale. As it is, I can't recommend it at this time.

But I hope to recommend it in the future.",1599453980,1599506588,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197977470718,292,18,3659,40,1832,1601161987

The only complaint I have is that a lot of the ""side quests"", which usually consist of infiltrating an enemy base, and then stealing, hacking, or destroying enemy data or property, can easily become stale. These missions can be repetitive, but still fun to complete. Some of them include mini story arcs for the ""side heroes"" (in other words, not Ms. Marvel), so this prevents the missions from becoming burdensome, and adds some depth to the other characters.

The combat system has a decent depth level to it, making it pretty engaging. This added with the top-notch animations and sound design, makes for a really unique brawler experience.

All 6 Superheroes plays differently, and excels at different areas. So, playing to each character's strength is key. Say if you try to play Hulk the same way you play Blackwidow, then you're probably gonna have a tougher time dispatching the baddies.

The Assemble Campaign was surprisingly good too. I'm looking forward to more story arcs in the future.

24,75608587,english,"I have completed the campaign, and spent an evening with the rest of this game. I am evaluating this game on what it is, not what it could be one day. 

Is this a good game? No. Not really.  it’s not a bad game either. It is just kind of average and skates by on the strength of its license. 

The Good: Campaign Mode Story - Kamala Kahn is a delight. She is this absolutely perfect mix of adorable, intelligent, and strong. She hops right off the pages of G. Willow Wilsons seminal run where the character first found her voice, and hits the ground in this game running. Using a young and inexperienced hero was a good choice for the narrative. The campaign took me about 20 hours to beat, but I really took my time. I would expect that most people will finish the campaign in half that time. 

I felt that the locales were varied enough in the campaign that it didn’t feel repetitive, but as I started to play the multi-player I started to see how someone who intended to run the same map 50 times could start to feel that way. 

The Bad: Combat in the game is clunky. The controls work just fine. When I press parry, attacks are parried.  The window for inputs is tight. The problems come from some of the mechanical choices that the designers made. The characters can’t take a lot of abuse before the are downed. While this makes sense that black widow is going to go down if she gets punched in the face a couple of times by a giant robot, when the same thing happens to the Hulk, it just feels bad. 

Getting hit staggers your characters, which interrupts the flow of your game. This can lead near instant death. It feels bad to lose progress because you made a single mistake in a chaotic combat. Some enemies are unduly frustrating. Some have attacks that drain your resource meters for your special attacks. Ranged enemies a can hit you with little warning from off the screen, which staggers you. A lot of enemies take too long to defeat. The combat in its current state does not feel rewarding. 

The Good: Character Variety. There are six playable characters in Avengers, and they all feel unique and different. Black Widow zips around devastating enemies one by one, while Thor brings his hammer down in a flash of lighting that deals damage to everything near by. Hulk picking up a bad guy and using him to bludgeon another bad guy never gets old. Each character in Avengers offers unique mechanics and an experience that is different enough that no two characters feel the same. 

The Natural(?): Character progression.  The progression system is two tiered. First there is character level. This is a standard kill stuff to get experience points to level up your character progression system. However, gaining a level does not give you more attack power or health, it just gives you a skill point to unlock more of your characters abilities. 

The second progression system is “power level” reflected in equipment that you can find in missions and equip on your character.  As you find better gear, the enemies will scale to your new gear level, and better gear will drop. Ultimately, the whole “power level” system feels pointless thanks to enemy scaling. The numerical value of your characters strength may increase, but so does the enemies HP. 

The Ugly: The camera – Who designed this thing? I’ve not felt the need to complain about a camera in a decade, but here we are. The camera constantly obscures my view making it impossible to see where attacks are coming from. In a game that relies on accurate dodging and parrying to keep your characters alive, this is an unforgivable sin.  

The Bad: traversal – I will start by saying that traversal is not all bad. It’s a joy to move around levels with Black Widow and Ms. Marvel.  Iron man and Thor can fly.  Flying feels stiff, where it should feel fluid. Hover, up, down, and fast flying. That’s about it. Not fun. Just serviceable. 

Hulk and Captain America, however, are mostly stuck to the ground. They can run on walls, but those walls are few and far between. Captain America can double jump, which helps his horizontal jumping distance some, but when he does so this slow floaty mid-air summersault animation plays. For most of the game, Captain America and Hulk are just stuck sprinting everywhere. Which in a game about super heroes is super lame.  

The Ugly: Technical Glitches – This is a  full priced game released by a major studio. There is no good reason for this game to release with the number of technical glitches that it has. I was fortunate enough to avoid any of the game breaking bugs that others have reported. There were several occasions where I had to restart a level because of a technical glitch. I also ran into minor glitches that were annoying. I know that most of these glitches are going to be ironed out in future patches, but before the developers gave the green light to release this game to the public at large, the most egregious of these issues should have been fixed. 

The Bad: “Micro” transactions – The cosmetics in this game are expensive.  The game does allow players to unlock “iconic” costumes for each character by completing mission chains, and these costumes represent one of a characters more recognizable looks from over the years. But if you like to put your own personal spin on characters, be prepared to shell out a not insignificant amount of money. If you are the patient sort, you might be able to get the skins you want using in game currency, as a limited number of rotating skins are available for purchase using units you collect as you play. 

The worst example of the micro-transaction manipulation in this game is found in the Challenge cards. Each character has a challenge card where you complete daily or weekly challenges for points. As you gain points, you unlock in game goodies. Each challenge card has a few cosmetic items for each character. These challenge cards do not have time limits. If you complete challenges every day it will still take weeks to unlock everything. Or you can pay real money, and skip challenges. The combination of intentionally slow progression and the ability to skip ahead for just a couple bucks feels like an underhanded effort to squeeze a couple more dollars out of all of us. 

The micro transactions in this game are not the worst out there. There are no gacha mechanics, random loot boxes, or paying for an in-game advantage. 

The Good: The game is pretty – The characters look like more realistic takes of their iconic selves. Hulk in particular looks great. The only character I have a problem with is Captain America because I think he looks too much like Chris Pine. But that’s on me, not the designers.

While this game does like to reuse tile sets, the tile sets are uniformly very well designed. There is a great attention to detail everywhere, and the world just screams “Marvel” everywhere. The explosions, energy beams, lightning bolts, and other visual flair all looks great. Some of the wilderness environments are a little flat, but they do the job.  

The music is exactly what video game music should be – present without being overbearing. 

I did like the sound effects. Thor’s hammer in particular returns with a sound strait out of the Movies. Heavy blows hit with real impact. Captain America’s shield makes a satisfying “clang” when he pops a robot in the face with it. 

I won’t spoil any of the ending sequence other than to say the last half of the last level was amazing.

Overall – I had fun playing through the campaign. The gameplay is serviceable but needs work before I can say it is “good”, the license is used well, and the micro-transactions can be ignored if you are patient. If you are an Avengers fan, you will like this game. If you only have a passing interest in the franchise, then maybe check back in in a couple months to see if the technical issues have been adequately addressed before spending a full $60.

25,75608539,english,"I'll talk about the things I like before getting critical and I'll also list my personal pros and cons at the end for anyone who wants to just skip this review entirely and just see what's hot and what's not. The story actually isn't bad in my opinion, hero banter between each other can be pretty funny although sometimes a little corny. The game looks really good and quite honestly runs very well, I was half expecting this game to run horribly the first time I saw it but it's very smooth. The combat is fun and it feels satisfying, each hero feels very unique and different from each other and have pretty awesome abilities that can be powered up with passives. The level designs are pretty decent, nice and spacious with a lot of room to explore. All in all I really don't think it's a bad game..when it works. 

At the moment I can't recommend this game due to frequent crashes and various bugs (enemies disappearing, soft locking at the end of a mission and having to redo the entire mission, game crashing at the end of the mission before going into the end mission screen so your progress does not count and therefore having to redo the entire mission again, etc). In the amount of time I've played I've probably crashed nearly a dozen times while playing any mission, really, it's pretty damn annoying and honestly draining because you have to do everything again, even though the game saves what you pick up and the exp you get before a crash, it's still super aggravating to have to do each tedious task again.

TL;DR/Pros and Cons

Pros:
-Fluid and fast combat that feels satisfying no matter who you play
-Gorgeous looking visuals
-Decent story line
-Game runs smoothly (if you can run it)
-Heroes are fun to play

Cons:
-Bugs and crashes at the worst possible times during and even sometimes after a mission. Sometimes if you do everything in a mission, if the game crashes before you get to the mission end screen then you're boned, good bye progress.
-Repetitive missions
-A lot of reused assets, the amount of times I've raided the same underground AIM base is countless.
-Dialogues being completely silent so NPCs either talk to themselves or don't save anything.
-Missing enemies in missions making progression impossible.
-Camera work, sometimes the camera just gets so up in whatever you're fighting that it's so damn hard to tell what you're doing.
-MOBILITY AND MOVEMENT, I think there needs to be more movement upgrades for all the heroes (yeah, even the flying ones) I can't help but feel like it's really boring to run and jump around in these open zones because you move so slow (EVEN THE FLYING DUDES) some kind of speed increase or something when out of combat would be damn helpful maybe a double sprint or some boosters on the ground, anything, god it feels fun to jump around but when you're going at a snails pace it blows.

Anyways, I do think the game is fun when it works, I am looking forward to future updates to see what these guys do. The biggest thing they need to work on right now is squash bugs and fix crashes. Despite the issues I have with the game I'm still going to play it to see where it goes. If you're on the fence, I'd recommend holding off for now.

The gameplay is amazing. The combat is awesome. The animations and graphics are outstanding. 

The bugs are ridiculous. The game randomly shuts down in the middle of major boss fights, meaning you have to do the entire mission over again. The sound cuts out for no reason sometimes. Graphical bugs happen a lot with certain characters. Wearing Captain America's WW2 outfit makes him look like he's suffered several strokes back to back.

Just this morning I had two HARM missions get bugged out in the middle of them, where a random enemy was behind a wall and you can't kill them. Meaning you have to start all over. 

Then upon trying a regular mission instead of a HARM mission, my co op friend could not see his health bar at all (this happened twice yesterday also), and then the game randomly crashed during a regular run of the mill fight.

28,75608054,english,"So far it's a fun game, but with a lot of problems. Now I love Marvel and old comics, so it hurts to write a negative review. First off, Iron Man feels awful to play. Clearly the game mechanics are designed to work with multiple heroes, but he just feels super clunky. Secondly, it feels like a carbon copy of Destiny 2 with a reskin. Several parts of the game are almost identical to how Destiny 2 functions. Taking elements from other titles wouldn't normally be bad thing, but they took a LOT and it seems like they took not only the good parts of Destiny 2, but the bad parts as well. The UI is incredibly unintuitive and gross, and 90% of the loot feels insignificant. The voice acting is bad. I can tell they used big name voice actors, but their voices simply do not fit the characters. The only one I like is Kamala. The dialogue is CONSTANTLY cut off, so you pretty much have to stand still when the characters are talking. Combat feels good most of the time, but when there are ranged enemies and turrets, it becomes a nightmare since the dark souls dodge mechanic wasn't designed to handle 84 projectiles at once, 50 of them being lasers that follow you. Now onto the bugs.. they are bad. The most noticeable one is enemies glitching through terrain and preventing progress. I have run into this one a lot and since the level design is corridors locked off until you kill a group of enemies, you literally cannot progress if even 1 enemy glitches through the floor. I am at a point in the story where I am stuck (the mission: ""To stand alone"") because of this bug. I have reloaded the checkpoint like 6-7 times and I'll inevitably hit like 3-5 of the enemies into a wall and I have to reset again. Other bugs include animation glitches, places not showing up on the map, and plenty of other minor ones. I have only played 6 hours so far, but by the pace it looks like I'm going in the story from the progress meter on the map, it seems the game also has a significant lack of content. It is a good concept, but feels rushed to release without any significant polishing.

But what I dont like are the amount of times the game crashes or runs like complete and utter trash. I am lucky if I can play more than an hour at a time without it crashing. Its optimization is pure freaking garbage. I also dont like the fact that when you do a mission and you look to do the '?' that you find that some you cant do because you arent playing as that character. It doesnt make sense. If they are in the party I should either be able to command them to do whatever the '?' is or I should be able to switch freely between characters. I also think its pretty BS that the characters dont level up with you, or stay within your level +/- 5 levels so if you main a few characters, the rest get left in the dust. Which is probably not a good mechanic to have if you are going to be adding more characters to the roster. The UI is crap. I cant return to the helicarrier at all to look at gear vendors or anything. the f**k is up with that? The flying between Ironman and Thor is a joke. Hulk isnt strong at all which is weird since Thor will be power 11 but have a heroic score of 600 when you get him. Lmao its a weird mechanic.

Campaign is pretty good but only about 12 hours long, multiplayer is ala Destiny, a grind for gear and doing bosses at higher difficulties. Promising to see that they will be bringing out almost every month new content, including more story.

Game currently has a roster of six : Hulk, Thor, Iron Man, Captain America, Black Widow ( the OG Avengers) and Kamala Khan ( new Ms Marvel) who is a bit like Mr Fantastic. skillset wise.

Its expected we will see another fifteen heroes in the future so alot of content to look forward to.

My only gripe is the performance needs some work. For me not that big an issue, I run at 90-110 fps at 1440p but with my speccs it should be my native 144hz. People with mid tier Pc""s are having issues so the optimization is up in the air, maybe you will run it great or maybe not.

Each character plays differently and I really enjoy them all. I'm not in the endgame yet, so I dunno what's waiting there, but all the future updates and characters are free which is a plus   

Graphics are stunning at 4k high. I have AMD Fidelity CAS on, Dynamic res scaling on and set to 60, vsync on. Preset is set to high on my 2080ti. I have the intel enchanced destruction and water turned off, got some weird hitching when enabled.

Enemy balancing needs a couple passes, but the base game and what's here in the initial offering is really fun. Again, the story is really good. Well worth the price of admission. There appears to be plenty of content on offer at launch, with a ton promised in the future. 

There are definitely bugs, I haven't hit any game breaking ones. However, had a couple that required restarts, and there's definitely some weird stuttering that creeps in every now and then. I've definitely enjoyed my time with it so far. Still haven't completed the story, but all of my time in the game has been spent just doing the story quests. I have ten hours so far. Unlocked all of the heroes, and it appears theres a few missions left for me on the main quest before I'm done with the campaign. So just over 10 hours for the story if you're doing nothing else. Much better than Destiny, Division, etc have to offer on their launch. And the story makes sense, acting is great, and it's engaging.

71,75602566,english,"In its current form I could not in good conscience recommend this game even to the biggest Marvel and/or looter-shooter fan. 

The beta left a sour taste in my mouth with all of its tedious gameplay and bugs. Since I had nothing else to play and this seemed to get a bunch of good reviews both on Steam and from reviewers, decided to give this a whirl anyway. Not like I'm losing much here. There is definitely potential there with all your favourite super heroes in there, but all of that potential is currently buried under a mountain of dumb design decisions and truly inexcusably awful technical issues.

I truly hope these issues will be fixed in due time, but the publisher should be ashamed of publishing something in this condition. What the heck was Square Enix thinking letting this come out in the state it's in?

Some of the most notable things I've encountered so far:
[list]
[*]During the first boss fight against Abomination, Abomination repeatedly glitched out of existence. This disappearance did not end the boss encounter, so I was soft locked into the encounter. I even restarted from a previous checkpoint, but the same glitch happened again. Had to restart the game and rush through the encounter to get past the glitching boss fight

[*]Normal enemies can be fused into walls by entering melee while they are near walls. Amazing to see these kinds of bugs in a game released in 2020.

[*]The game crashes consistently. Not infuriatingly often, but at least 1 or 2 every 4 hours. Previous to this I can't even remember the last game that crashed on me. That should tell you something.

[*]The game has a serious issues with memory management, and it seems to not handle scene resets well. Performance will progressively get worse each time a scene has to be reloaded(eg. after you die). Feels like they might not actually be handling the reloading correctly?

[*]Even if you don't die, performance will start degrading after the game has been open for about an hour. A full restart of the game is required to reset performance to normal levels.

[*]The player is still shown tutorials after having spent 15+ hours with the game. For things they've already been taught. Just what?

[*]Players are forced to play under-levelled characters in a boss fight that furthers the campaign. There is no way to level the characters, so you just have to keep on grinding the boss fight and hope that a glitch will kill them.

[*]To the previous point, the game comes off as very poorly balanced overall.

[*]The least satisfying loot system and looter-shooter game loop I've encountered thusfar.

The Story had me gripped the whole time, now the story its self isnt anything too complicated but It holds up very well, Modok is an awesome villain, and slowly putting together the avengers makes you learn every character as well as making you excited for who is next to come, story gets a 7/10.

The writing and voice acting is amazing, instantly had me invested in these characters, my fav being this growing relaionship between Kamalah and the rest of the Avengers, especially Bruce, it had me really caring about the different relationships between the characters, the story dosent have to be mind blowing for the rest of the experience to be rich, they very much remind me of the Avengers from the movies, Thor has his dumb funny moments, stark has his witty lines, as well as the over arching story making changes within the relationships throughout the game, sometimes i was so invested in the story telling i forgot i was playing a game.
 writing and voice acting gets an easy 10/10. 

SPOILER WARNING (I'm about to talk about the endgame and some of the villains) skip to the next para if you dont want spoilers. 
The enemies and Villains are... more than a little lacking, I actually like the aim bots, there are alot of different ones, some are difficult big and fun to fight enemies, though they're all a bit... samey, i understand it works with the story but it would have been nice to see more actual villains and badguys, most of the bosses were just aim units like the Warbot and the War ship, or someone in a mech suit, the actual villains they have are actually really fun to fight, Task Master, Abomination, MODOK are all brillaint fights throughout the campaign, and make for some really fun and challenging raid like bosses for the multiplayer, considering how much i enjoyed the villains that were there it just makes me more sad that there is a real lack of them, the very end of the MODOK fight i thought i was about to fight the Sentry and it ended up swapping out what could have been a bigger and meaner final boss for a quick time event.
I've seen alot of people complain that the Avengers would just stomp most of the enemies, but at the end of the day its a game and they have to give you things to fight, I don't really care for this point
For enemies including bosses and big villains this game is getting a 6/10 from me. 

Muliplayer
So the multiplayer is insanely fun, being able to choose my avenger and spec him how i want at any time is really nice, communicating with my friends, swooping in and fighting long side them when they need help, very naturally fitting into certain roles for example Thor has alot of crowed control where as Iron man smoothly deals with flying enemies efficiently, very very fun, though that being said after playing the beta I was disappointed in the overall lack of multiplayer content, with only like 30 missions the beta felt like it covered most of it honestly, considering theres a lack of missions alot of them are short and very samey, i found my self finishing most of the multiplayer content with my friends in a few hours, now these missions do scale as you level up, and you can accept different difficulty levels but it just dosent feel like enough, i dont want to be replaying repetitive missions just to squeeze as much multiplayer time as i can out of this game, though things like the raid bosses do make me very hopfull about what there is to come. 
Multiplayer gets a 7/10 

Polish
Now at this point we're all aware that the game is BUGGY AS HELL!!!! this is one of my biggest gripes with the game, theres a whole ton of bugs, from characters T posing to just straight up crashes, there are a whooooole lot of bugs, its not very polish BUT that being said they've already given us various updates fixing alot of issues, the game is a bit of a mess but honestly i have high hopes they'll fix alot of these issues as quick as possible.
Polish gets a 3/10 (with high hopes of improvement) 

Now to me this next bit is probably the most important, and thats why we NEED to give this game a real chance. 
the base product is lacking in many ways but it also delivers in many also. to me its very clear that there is alot to come with this game, with a growing list of confirmed additional heros who i'm sure will come with more content also, this game could become a real gem, i cant wait to play doctor strange! and more so than that i'm very very excited for the games mutiplayer content to be expanded, more big villains and enemies that the game desperately needs we're pretty much Garunteed to get, we had a trailer for a new character before the game even fully launched! honestly i've got a good feeling that new content and fixes for this game are going to be thick and fast, i think its really important to give this game a real chance so they can actually do this, they need us to be able to expand on what they have, they clearly need some loyalty and some patience, I'm extremely excited for whats to come.

Cosmetics are awesome! though considering we're going to have to pay for alot of additional content i think the microtransactions are... cheeky... that being said they're not used for anything important, the game is still playable without these cosmetics, and there are alot of unlockable cosmetics through out the story, challenge card, shops and mission rewards, and alot of the cosmetics are bad ass!!!! really cool stuff, some of ironmans suits are really cool, Hulk with war paint? oh he looks so good! cosmetics are great but the game dosent need micro-transactions honestly.
cosmetics get 7/10

as an end note I'd like to add FUCK SONY, no one is going to buy a Playstation purely to play Spiderman, to me all it is is childishley withholding one of the Avengers core characters, can you imagine if they made a Halo game for all platforms and Microsoft was just like ""well you're not having master cheif!"" its bullshit, give spiderman to the masses and NOT just people who already own a Playstation, its really dumb and it really is just childish. 

Overall i fully recommend the game, most of my actual issues with the game i have high hopes will be fixed with updates and additional content, though there are some big underlining issues i think the games launch was too messy and has very quickly given this game some real bad rep that honestly I dont think it deserves.

recap 
Characters/ gameplay - 9/10

Story - 7/10 

Writing and voice acting - 10/10

Villains and Enemies 6/10 (With high hopes of improvement) 

Multiplayer - 7/10

Polish - 3/10 (With thick and fast updates already coming every couple of days) 

GIVE THIS GAME A CHANCE! ITS FULLY WORTH IT AND I KNOW MY OVERALL SCORE WILL JUST GET HIGHER OVER TIME!

Great Story
Awesome Action

Lots of funny moments
Good Graphics
Found inner nerd in the main character Kamala
Fun to play with friends in multiplayer

Cons:
Lag spikes
Game freezes and will be stuck on endless audio loop until you have to force quit the game
Captain America can't break open or hack locked doors (fix that bullsh*t Dev's!)
Game Crashes
Objects will not load in till several minutes

Cap
Hulk
Ironman
Black Widow
Ms. Marvel 
And the God himself THOR

On Avengers day something goes wrong and a new material causes some explosions and shit and makes Inhumans. These are regular people with powers. Really to avoid spoilers thats about all I will say. The story is damn fucking good. 8/10

Now the meat and Potatoes that is Avengers. 

MULTIPLAYER
Once you beat the game you have access to all Avengers and can go and do quasi dungeons with groups. Each Avenger has a separate level and gear set. You will only get gear drops for THAT character that you are playing. So if you need the new Iron Man Repulsers Get the fuck out there Tony. The gearing system and everything kinda feels like a great Looter. You see the purple or Yellow and DART over. Hell even the greens are decent to get your Gear score up and push your iLvl (Item Level). Running around as your favorite Avenger is fucking fun. Skill trees, Gears and all the like makes this a theory craft wet dream. There are different elements that if you have a group of people you play with you can make a dream team (Never play with me if you want to play Thor Cause it just wont happen)

NOW you may be asking ""Eric isnt it kinda boring with only 6 Avengers?"" to which I would say SHUT YOUR FUCKING MOUTH. Because there are planned DLC that adds characters to the story and ALSO adds STORY to the main game. ""Oh yea Eric good sell I cant wait to play fucking Hawkeye and Black Panther woo"" TO WHICH I SAY SHUT THE FUCK YOUR FACE Because Square Enix Licensing has been confirmed by SE themselves to include ALL 80 FUCKING YEARS OF MARVEL CONTENT. THAT IS FUCKING RIGHT WE GOT THE XMEN BABY. This game has so much room for growth it kinda makes me sick. This is my main game for a long time.

96,75598701,english,"Took me 24 hours of playtime to finish the campaign.  I thought the story was surprisingly well done, and if you're into superhero stuff this game is worth your time for that reason alone.  The story centers around Kamala Khan (Ms Marvel), who so far hasn't appeared in any Marvel movies or TV shows.

Gameplay and combat feels similar to the Marvel Ultimate Alliance style games, except third person instead of top-down.  Superficially it resembles brawlers like Arkham Asylum and Hand of Fate (timing dodges/counters), but you need to be a lot more strategic when you're outnumbered since enemies do NOT wait to attack you one at a time.  Conversely, it's a lot easier to get around an enemy's defenses by working with a teammate, even an AI one.

The campaign is in some ways just the ""start"" of the game, like a very well-polished introduction to all the mechanics and starting 6 characters.  After you finish, there is a LOT of progression in playing each of the characters and unlocking their full, and even some multiplayer story elements such as connected missions.  This is where new content will eventually be added as well.

The game has a full gear and shop type system, but you are honestly best off mostly ignoring it - the most important stat on any piece of gear is the generalized ""power"" one.  Just go to your character sheet every once in a while, push the button for ""equip highest power gear"", and dismantle everything else.  The reason for this is that your character's power level determines what power level gear drops, so there's basically no point to fine-tuning the gear until you hit the max gear power level (130; by comparison I finished the campaign around 30 on a couple characters).  Power level is also how mission difficulty and matchmaking works.

Multiplayer matchmaking works efficiently and the game seems to handle latency and so on reasonably well.  I played on launch and only encountered a couple of crashes during campaign cutscenes, but on reload the game remembers exactly where you were.  The interface can sometimes be a bit slow, such as taking several seconds to load the ""continue"" button.

Overall, though, I had fun and might come back for more multiplayer.",1599489514,1599489514,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197963867398,394,14,1614,0,1614,1599487384

The combat is good overall, but there gets to be too many things shooting at you at times. I also only like a couple of characters out of the 6 out right now. I personally have not run into a single bug yet. I know that there are tons of them and some may be pretty detrimental to your experience. I'm not sure how the multiplayer is, but I doubt I'll be doing much matchmaking. I'm treating this game as a singleplayer experience even after the campaign. I played one match with somebody and they just kept running to thr objective instead of grabbing the bonus objectives. Every time they did that, I would get teleported to them. I think this is worth getting as a singleplayer or coop (not whole story is coop) game. There are microtransactions for cosmetics, but it's easy enough to just ignore.

The first boss, Abomination, disappears everytime I get him low health in his second stage. It's total BS and needs to be fixed, it worked in the Beta so there is no reason it shouldn't be working now.

Edit: Managed to fix the issue by verifying the files. 
This game is pretty great, if you're a fan of the comics or movies you'll have a fun time with it. Probably don't want to play on Brutal difficulty because some of the missions where you have to control points (which i think might be part of coop missions not sure bought for singleplayer) are nearly impossible on Brutal.

I like looter shooter/RPG/leveling up kinda games, so found this interesting as a concept with The Avengers, however i did NOT play the BETA.

So now having 10.1 hours on the clock, i can have some sort of opinion as a Marvel fan who did'nt jump into the BETA and is playing fresh so to speak.

1. The Story is fine, what ive seen so far, can be immersive with the graphics being very good (even on low).

2. Combat. surprisingly good.  all feel very much tuned to The Avenger you play, so Hulk is slow but strong and powerful, and Thor has the lightning attacks and Black Widow and Capt being very good brawler type characters, and flying like Iron Man feels so good (i had with Anthem...ehh..), it can be tricky to remeber what does what on keyboard or controller.

3. Gear. its quite important as you go on, and you can focus on one of them to make a good powerful avenger (my iron man is good already), depends if you like grinding.

4. replyable. hard to say at the moment ad ive not completed The Campaign, i can see myself trying to figure out some of the secret rooms and chests, replykimg some of the mission and doing some of the rep grinding.

But its better then i thought it would be

50,75590162,english,"After finishing the Storycampaign and digging into Multiplayercampaign for quite a bit, here some impressions:

The Story in my opinion, is quite enjoyable and the way you unlock all heroes fits good.
It kinda feels like a 3D beatem up at first, but when you dive into the game a bit, you will unlock several passives and Skills which make the game a bit more complex. Sure you could just spam 1 combo, but im not sure if thats a good way to play it on any champ.

So far i would say that multiplayer has alot missions/content to do for a lootergame like that...although im not sure how long people would play the game if they would just focus on 1 hero.
But the progression with Skills/Gear and perks feels really good to me.

now my pros and cons

Pros: - Graphics are decent even on medium settings
         - Good story on singleplayer and multiplayer (not for all but for marvelfans for sure i think)
         - Gameplay is fun with several Combos and Builds
         - 6 playable Heros is nice for the initial release ( and more are coming soon)
         - solid variety of Missions to do (iconic hero missions for each hero, lots of other missions

Cons: - Performance and Stability is god damn horrible (had to do some fixes because of Crashes and Fps drops are real (game is very Gpu hungry)
          - Combat can be fun but the targeting is sometimes very random
          - several Bugs at the moment of Release, some are ignorable, some are very annoying
          - Price is argueably high ( you mostly pay for the Brand)
          - Multiplayer matchmaking is not really the best

In the end i would still recommend it to people who enjoy looters like destiny 2 or warframe (anthem xD) but just in a marvel-setting (with the comedy and the herotheme)
and i think lots of the Cons can be erased by future patches

55,75589400,english,"I'm only a few hours in but already this game is showing a number of game problems.

I have a few graphics and physics glitches. Most aren't serious but in the Chimera the lighting just flickers on and off forever, depending on where I stand and what direction I face. It doesn't happen anywhere else in the game. Similarly, objects sometimes fly around randomly and characters ""jitter"" as they move. 

More important than the glitches is the number of gameplay items that feel unpolished or unbalanced. Platforming ranges from so easy it's pointless to pointlessly difficult because the camera moves when you don't expect. Difficulty doesn't seem to be tied to the actual ""difficulty"" level, which is represented by a number. Taking a break from a hard mission and grinding out some power and character levels is unlikely to do a whole lot to help you; at least that isn't my experience so far. 

There is a gear system that probably matters if you're going to play this game Destiny-style, but it has the same problem that game has where you get gear so fast it doesn't matter in the slightest what gear you have on. 

The ranged combat is just...just terrible. Aiming is harder than it should be, and just when you think you've got it - let's say Iron Man's lock-on missiles - you'll unlock an ability that removes the generous single-missile lock-on and makes you use a ""hold the trigger to lock on to multiple enemies lock-on"". Fine, except these missiles do less damage and you're (in most cases) VERY unlikely to be able to hold down the trigger long enough to actually lock on to multiple enemies or hit the same enemy with multiple rockets.

Overall this game just feels like it could have used another year in development. Difficulty spikes, physics and graphics issues, areas where dialogue feels missing...these are all the signs of something that could have used more love.

The story is fun and as a comics fan I'm enjoying it quite a bit, so despite my ranting my hour count will increase until I beat the campaign.

If you ignore all the side missions, you are likely to finish it in under 10 hours easily. I'm really scared that when they introduce new playable characters to the game, they will simply add a 20-30 minute mission for you to unlock the character and call it a day.

I understand that this is marketed as an aRPG, which means its main focus is not on the campaign but on the end game content that follows, on the grind, and on the ""replayability"" of it. However, I do believe that this was a massive potential wasted. The developers clearly did not pay close enough attention to Bioware's Anthem and the disaster it turned out to be. There are so many similarities between Marvel's Avengers and Anthem: the gameplay, the graphics, the structure, the loot system... the mistakes, the repetitiveness, the way each mission after the main story feel like chores, the lack of motivation to keep playing. Why do game makers nowadays think we love grinding and farming so much? I could literally write a detailed review about Anthem, change the title, and post it here as a review for Marvel's Avengers and no one would be able to tell.

So all that was my opinion on what I think about the game in general, now let me talk about the PC version of this game...

Don't even bother. 

The amount of bugs and glitches, both in visuals and in gameplay, is absolutely staggering. Enemies vanishing mid-fight (EVEN BOSSES) so you'd have to restart the game and the mission. Character models in cutscenes sometimes do not fully render in time so you'd see Kamala talking to a floating cape or hair. Bugged mission objectives and areas that require a full game restart to fix. And finally, the PISS POOR optimization they've done for the PC version means your $5,000 rig will be able to run this game on medium settings and still be seeing 1-30 FPS (YES 30, if you're lucky) at times.

Final verdict:
Don't buy this game at full price just yet. Wait for a sale or wait for them to add more content (story).
And ESPECIALLY, do not buy this game for PC. This game was made for consoles, and the fact that the PC version launched at the same time as the consoles does not change that.

86,75584260,english,"This game has gotten a lot of hate for random reasons.
and sure it isnt a perfect game, far from it. but it's fun. 

This game tends to feel slightly repetitive at times and thats usually something that draws me away from games. But for some reason I have been drawn back to keep playing the game and having fun solo and multiplayer. This game is for the right type of person who isnt super criticizing but is willing to sit down and be a SUPER HERO AND BEAT THE SH*T OUT OF PEOPLE.

It's fun the combat is completely preference if you like it or not but I genuinly enjoyed Captain America's Combat and being able to throw a shield and fist fight enemies.

My opnion: the game is completely preference based on if you would enjoy it or not. The story is actually really good it feels like a Marvel movie. post-apocalypse styled which is awesome. I do have to mention Thor has very little forced playtime in the campaign. With Black widow also in that state. But after campaign you can play any character without it forcing you to chose one. I just would have preferred a little more to the campaign. But as I said before the story is really good.

Conclusion: don't buy this game if you don't want too. it'll be hard to enjoy. If you do get it though I recommend having a friend or 2. Under half the campaign missions are Multiplayer so continuing the story with a friend can be really fun, you're literally super heroes in a post-apocalypse fighting robots and a giant bobble head.
But for those of you interested in ""should I wait for a sale"". If you're not sweating to get a fix for super hero stuff, you can wait. I bought the game because I really wanted to play something super hero styled and I'm satisfied. But if you can wait, just wait. The game should have been at least 49.99$

Every time I play Thor I soak my shirt pits because I'm trying to smash face with Mjölnir and the LIGHTNING and I just can't get enough.

Some of the highlights - voice acting is movie quality, sound effects are movie quality, graphics are amazing and it's flashy as can be. At higher level play the missions and environments change a bit to make it more challenging. It's very open world like for a game like this, there are many side quests you can do in a mission and it makes it a lot of fun and refreshing. The abilities/masteries/specialties system is dead simple and keeps your toolkit fresh.

Some of the cons - matchmaking is a bit clunky. User icons will show and disappear. Sometimes it will get the same hero as someone else and then the party has to disban. The menu isn't telling you what you're doing at times, so you think you're just sitting there, but it's queuing up - but these are things can are easy to fix - it's not like there is a fundamental flaw in the gameplay experience.

24,75580613,english,"This is a hard game to recommend. THE SHORT Answer, the game has tons of design flaws, with characters, levels, and a forced live service model. What could have been an amazing story game, got tossed aside to make way for battle passes and cosmetics, and hopes of future content being better. At launch, its also terribly riddled with bugs and issues, many of which where known about in the beta and werent ever fixed.

 Its a bit of a long explanation, but heres all the things that dont work for me with Marvels avengers

 As someone who grew up reading the comics, and as many other reviews will say, the story here is really, really good. From characters who dont feel completely 1 sided, good voice acting, and a large amount of sourcing directly to the comics, they really did amazing with their story, especially choosing to tell an all original story. While its not the longest story (I beat it in about 8 hours without sidequests), It was still nice to watch play out, even if a lot of it, and i mean a lot of it got spoiled in the game trailers. However thats really where things start taking a bad turn, is the core mechanics of the gameplay dont just not live up to expectations, it feels like a terrible step in the wrong direction.

A lot of people compare Iron Mans controls to that of anthems and honestly i wish that was true. The flight in this game is not the greatest, with the idea of hovering seemingly being an afterthought. Iron man feels very.....weightless. His attack animations are very long and easy to interrupt, and his character model honestly seems slightly to small. It felt like they were trying to make a ranged character melee, to better balance the game but they completely missed the mark. Hulk isnt good or bad, just wish he had more abilities or things he could do. Wall hopping as well. Specifically the fact that its hopping. You cant move him up or down, or have him climb left to right. you can only jump on and off a wall. Black Widow is in the same boat, not having tons of abilities and frankly feeling underwhelming. Kamala and black widows climbing/swinging mechanics also commonly dont move you far enough or high enough, and just dont feel good.
 The gameplay largely depends on the hero you play, But most heroes felt lacking, either having balancing issues, or not feeling very well developed. Not to mention you dont unlock 2 heroes till near the end of the game. And honestly the last half of the story is very quick. Honestly, another level or 2 between unlocking these characters would have been great. But that's where the late game content is supposed to come in handy right? At this moment, late game content doesnt exist. Theirs no point in grinding high level gear. theirs about 6 missions per sidequest and once those run out, all you can do is replay them. 

Lets not forget all the bugs. Day 1 release a few bugs are to be expected, but this is a bit excessive. Lots of Character movement glitches, AI teammates just standing in place or teleporting around the map, bad hitbox detection with certain enemies, and the amount the AI can stunlock you is absurd. The largest issue i had was the audio. in many sections of the game, audio from combat would not play out when hitting an enemy, voice lines in a level not working, or multiple cut scenes having no audio from the characters who are having a discussion. Theirs also a lot of cutscenes where characters are talking, but their facial animations dont change. Or times when characters just arnt fully in frame, as if the AI bugged out before the cutscene began. 


Another thing plaguing the game is bad level design. the first few areas are really not to bad, with A day clearly being something they spent a lot of time on. The main issue is having several locations spread out across parts of the globe, none of it feels detailed or lived in. The partially open areas of each world feel lifeless, and completely empty except for some copy pasted buildings with chests inside. After beating the story, and doing side quests it became worse, as most if not all side quests play out the same way. Go through this open area to a bunker, or other checkpoint. Break something. fight a boss, and call it good. While this isnt actually a bad formula, its the lack of care in variation that ruins the game. I started taking screenshots of bunkers only to realize that on the inside, the designs are largely copy pasted, with little variation. And i cant stress it enough, at the moment, thats all the endgame really has to offer. replaying side quests, and a few special multiplayer missions. 

This game while luckily not being pay to win, is heavily ruined by in game purchases. While im not opposed to buying skins, the ones here are not cheap, and theirs far to many to ever be feasibly unlocked. What ruins it for me is how blatant microtransactions are in the game. It cant ever be ignored. 

As future content comes out, with maybe more story, or something like a raid from destiny, as well as new characters, i might check in on the game from time to time, but beyond that i dont think i would play it. The games live service model seems to be its downfall, as A more fleshed out story, better level design, and character design, would have been exactly what most people wanted, which ultimately got trashed to make room for.....more skins i guess? and dont forget, each heroes individual battle pass. Which is currently free, but i cant say i expect it to stay that way.",1599456572,1599456628,False,3,0,0.54356849193572998,0,True,False,False,76561198197181823,144,4,1237,42,863,1601105529

30,75580201,english,"the game looks great, gameplay is fun, story is interesting, but gets kinda repetitive after a while.
And at the time of writing (7/9/20) I cannot recommend the game in its current buggy and unbalanced state.

the lowest level cannon fodder enemies can take out like 70% of your health with one hit, and they can take a butt load of damage, despite you being much stronger, and on a higher level.

ranged enemies, like turrets, are near impossible to dodge, and they do ridiculous amounts of damage. They're pretty easy to take out, but in huge fights where you're surrounded by enemies, you can't really take the time to shoot them, meaning you'll just get slaughtered.

dodging or parrying attacks is often difficult because the effects are very unclear and kinda blend into the background.

Abilities that need recharging can be interrupted by most enemies, even your [i] Ultimate, [/i] meaning you've just wasted the ability, and you need to wait for it to recharge. And the abilities take forever to recharge.

I've noticed some minor bugs here and there, but the major game-breaking bug I've had happen to me is bosses just randomly disappearing, meaning you can't progress further. I'm stuck on this one mission, I won't spoil it but, near the end of it, I had to fight this big 5 man team of mini-bosses, and after killing 4 of them, the last one disappeared. After I reloaded the checkpoint, I managed to kill one boss, and the rest just disappeared again.

54,75577602,english,"**I left the game running to take care of things many times so my ACTUAL played gameplay is not 28 hours, probably more like 7 or so but, they went by in a BLINK, it's FUN!**

Let me address up front, reviews of this game have been mediocre and I was tempted not to even purchase it but I gave it a shot anyway. Maybe reviews tempered my expectations but I'm very happy I did because it's been a delight so far.

I've only played the campaign so far and for someone who normally only plays games for multiplayer -that's saying something.

Also as someone with a demanding career and a new parent, I need games that let me step away easily -this game is so good at that, no punishment for stepping away without notice at any point.

Good:

- Graphics are great
- Feels immersive, I feel like i'm a big monster when I play the hulk or have a blast carpet bombing people from the skies with Ironman. Khamala's stretchiness sounded weird but is very fun and creates a unique way to attack
- Combat is fairly involved can be challenging
- Each character feels very different with their abilities, great variety depending on your playstyle
- Story is amazing and unique, the main hero isn't someone you are familiar with and they did a great job with fresh content
- Gear grind seems interesting so far, typical Diablo-esque
- Game seems very stable so far and well optimized,  i'm running a GTX 1080 so not on a new card either
- CASUAL / PARENT FRIENDLY, alt tabbing pauses the game no matter what you are doing. Need to take care of something, hit alt tab, do it, alt tab and pick up where you left off (even mid fight) **In campaign of course**
- Environment after the first few missions offers a reasonable amount of flexibility in how you attack the mission, fly, flank, go up and over, etc. I was worried early on in the tutorial that i'd be stuck in stupid tunnel paths.

Bad

- While most maps offer quite a bit of flexibility, some feel pretty symmetrical.
- Many maps are very similar, hopefully they add more eventually to mix it up
- If you are like me and not very good at twitch stuff, playing some of the heroes (black widow for example) can be very frustrating (even on easy). I'm just not good at dodging at the right time etc. Dodging on keyboard the keys seem odd too, like a or d isn't actually a or d sometimes. This could very likely just be my poor twitch ability. I play games to relax so for me, too challenging is sometimes aggravating, those who like a challenge will love it and/or maybe much easier.

I've not played multiplayer yet so I can't comment there, I plan to though and will update after.

The big question of course will be replayability / end game. Because the story is so good, I'm not in a rush like I usually am with games (to get to end game). Limited maps concerns me a bit but the game is new and they did well out of the gate. 

I'd recommend this game for the story alone -even if you don't play games for that, it really is great and pulls you into it -even emotionally.",1599450863,1599450863,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198006353287,398,14,2362,0,1711,1599797534

Long Matchmaking times unfortunately (could change soon). 

Don't expect to unlock a bundle of skins at least within your first two weeks.(Casual Player) Costs of skins require full time play to obtain early and feel too expensive.

(if you find a crash fix lemme know running on 20 gb of ram 1080 TI GTX)

Edit(9/6/2020 Post Update): Crashes seem to have vanished but Match-making has decreased in time (which is good). Players seem to use Voice but Voice chat is drowned out by every other sound, at least on PC, lowered all other sounds to compensate. 

So far so good
Matchmaking now takes far less time(No longer need to use Quick Match)
no crashes
Voice works

56,75577504,english,"So this game has been absolute hell for me and my friend to actually get to work, and it still doesn't.
I played through the opening cutscene in campaign, moved around a bit as Kahn, changed settings then went to Avenger's Intiative (The multiplayer mode). There I did the tutorial for how to use Tony Stark then went to change to Black Widow. 
At that point the game froze. I used task manager to close it, then tried to reopen. I get to where it says start and the game freezes. I have tried out getting verified files, put settings to the lowest, tried the two full screen options and windowed, uninstalled and reinstalled the game, tried the workaround of being invited to a strike team, restarted it multiple times. I now have 2.1 hours of play time when the actual number is close to 20 min before this bug.
The contact support took two days to get back to me with a frankly automated answer that had nothing to do with the actual issue.
I have a very high end desktop that well exceeds the recommended specs before it is mentioned.

So my friend. They are actually able to play a bit and I was able to watch them through discord a bit, however they keep having a freezing and stuttering issue, as well as just a crash at a particular part of a sewer that cannot be avoided. 

The sad thing is, is that what I saw from the cutscenes and the gameplay of my friend, the story of this game is amazing and exactly fits the comic versions of characters (except Thor who is a bit more like his movie side). They have little references at every turn and have true attention and care into it. But it is completely unplayable

Story/Voice Acting: Very well done. The voice acting is superb, if a little strange because it's not the MCU actors. But this is old Bioware level of voice acting (think Mass Effect Trio). The Campaign story isn't groundbreaking, just basically the normal 'team hits adversity and now a new member must draw them back together thru her charm and reminding them why the fight' mantra. While not overly creative, it's executed well and has moments which make you appreciate the writing. Only odd ball things I've seen is that while this is a story of empowerment, the main characters first choice in choosing a costume is to go with the sports hijab. Just usually when breaking the rules and rebelling one doesn't instantly sport the costume of one of the most restrictive religious practices in the known world. Was a bit strange but I know the Khan character was designed that way. 

Characters: While all I got to play was the opening with most of the roster, each character felt really good. From Widows more evasive style to Hulk's behemoth feel, each felt fantastic and fit the idea of how you would expect them to feel based on their abilities in the comics. Combat feels fluid and rewarding, although it will get hectic when dozens of enemies are on screen at once.  Just be prepared for the counter/dodge mechanic to annoy you due to odd camera angles and bright explosions.

Kamala Khan: this was what I though I would actually hate. 1st, the fact this is an RPG in 2020 and you can't make you're own custom superhero is kind of sad. Two, Khan is a collection of SJW talking points, having her idolize Captain Marvel (who is about as interesting as a box of rocks) and giving her the boring (subjective) powers of Mr. Fantastic has never really endeared the character to me. Her story arcs in the comics are sub par and what you expect from the current Marvel writing team who prioritizes politics over quality character building and story telling.

All that being said, she fits in beautifully here. The wide eyed, child-like excitement she exhibits is engrossing as we discover this story and world with her. Her interactions with the team in the tutorial feels grounded and real. Her dynamic with her father only adds to the immersion and makes you really appreciate her performance in this. The voice actress is incredible and the level of detail in the facial expressions and animations are amazing and helps you invest in her adventure.  Honestly, had I met the character on these terms, initially, without all the Marvel political grandstanding, I would have loved her. I want this version of Khan in the MCU. There is the odd phrasing on occasion which pushes the whole 'muslim resistance' movement mantra, but for the average western player they probably won't even notice. I've spent 56 months living in the Middle East and dealing with the culture on a personal level so I tend to notice their version of political talking points.

Gear Grind: First and foremost, this is a looter/brawler-shooter. Gear drops like candy. Unfortunately most of it is garbage. But it will require you to sift thru mountains of that garbage to get a workable build. However, there is a 'equip strongest items' button which I feel most of the community will end up using to avoid the headaches. The gear/builds wasn't as deep as I've come to expect with games like Division and Destiny being the examples, but it wasn't horrendous. I hope they push for more unique builds and gear combinations, because thats where alot of the replay ability comes from. But for a starting place it's not bad.

Overall: I really have enjoyed this game so far and it's frustrating as hell that several bugs have delayed my journey. If anything , I think this continues to shine a light on how broken the triple A gaming industry is. Cause the microtransactions (which aren't egregious here) work perfectly fine. All in all, if you're looking for something to pass the time till Cyberpunk finally drops, this isn't a bad buy. May even turn into a great online game. The foundation is there.

Gear and leveling is pretty dumb. This game seems to have the same issue with gear progression as destiny did.

Now I am a bit older and have a fairly more conservative playing style and I don't purchase as many games as I used to and I am more for decent storyline games.
So far, Marvel's Avengers hasn't dissappointed.
I was expecting a regurgitation or retelling of the recent movies but I was actually pleasantly surprised by how they went about the story on this one.
I do have ""some issues"" with certain characters, not with the character itself but one in particulars campaign mission was extremely more difficult than anything up to that point. I was cruising along, having a pretty good time with marginal annoyances here and there with some bugs and then WHAM the next portion of the story came and with it a level of frustration I don't care to go in to, ha. 
I did finally get through it, I probably played that specific scenerio 8-10 times. Lordy I don't have the coordination I used to.
From that point, smooth, fun sailing again until I make it to the ""You are starting the final portion of the campaign"" warning, I thought was odd but pushed ahead anyway. ***issues and slight annoyances from here***
I noticed the game is forcing me to take Thrall, which is normally fine, but for some reason, on this particular level when he goes crazy lighting bashing things, the game crashes.
1st time I thought ok, strange let's load back up.
Now this game takes it's sweet time loading and loading and laoding and laoding, and this is with plenty of RAM AND a gen4 nvme just to rule out anything else, so ok, it take's it's time from ""Play"" to getting back to the mission.
Get 10 minutes in, I do a big move, thrall does as well, game 100% crashes. Ok, now it's getting annoying.
Mind you, zero crashes leading up to this point, some bugs or twitchiness, sure, but no hard crashes.
Let's restart Windows this time, load back in.... 10-12 minutes in, ok, we're further than before, that restart must've fixed it, Ok, let's go nuts on these guys! Hard Crash / black screen. That's it, shut it down, take a brake, come back later.
3 or so hours later, fire the game back up, let's try some of the side missions to warm up.
Those go just fine, do another, then another, ok I am moving right along quickly, let's jump back to that final campaign again.
Again the game forced Thrall on me, again I have no idea if this is causing any of this BS at this point but I jsut know that if I crash, the god of thunder is there, jsut saying.
Maybe 5 minutes in, hard game crash, black screen.... Done for a while.
I am not sure if anyone else is getting complete game hard crashes on the final part of the campaign like I am but 6 times. I can not even finish it yet many other levels play through just fine, even with Ol' Thundernuts. 

Do I like the game, Oh yeah. I enjoy it a lot. I just want to be able to complete that level to see what is next and not HAVE to only do back story or side missions. 
I will come back and play those but like I mentioned earlier, I'm a storyline guy, let me play through, if I make it to the end, you did your job and kept my attention, win/win for both of us.
Do I recommend? I mean Yes I do and I am sure this will be fixed soon. But yes, the game is interesting, I enjoy the story arc and even if it doesn't have a ton of replay, I am still fine buying it.

When the campaign is good, it's damn good. As a byproduct of that, the bad moments stick out a lot more. Multiple times in the middle of story missions you will be asked to hold a zone or complete various tedious objectives that so clearly were designed for the multiplayer aspect of the game.

Boy, I'm sure glad I bought it.

**MILD SPOILERS AHEAD**

When Marvel's Avengers works, it WORKS. Combat is fluid, the characters feel distinctly different (Thor plays like a god and Iron Man is your classic glass canon) and the story...well, it was cliche riddled and predictable. Then again, so are the comics. Featuring Big-Head McChairbaby as our primary villain was an absolutely outstanding move and I loved kicking MODOK's ass with an absolute passion.

Kamala Khan as the protag was a good move. I'm always down for seeing more representation of different ethnicities, cultures and faiths as protagonists. I've been a fan of Kamala for a long time, and to see her and PLAY as her was very, very cool.

Now, the game has it's bad points. My wife plays with me and her rig is almost as beefy as my own, but she suffers from frame stuttering, freezes and occasional crashes. Unfortunately, this is something I've come to expect from a triple A game. I don't blame Crystal Dynamics for this, I blame Square Enix. Publishers these days are all about ""get it out ASAP, fix it later"". In my opinion we, the consumer, shouldn't be paying to beta test a game unless it's an early access deal and ADVERTISED as such.

That said, Marvel's Avengers does feel complete, if in desperate need of some patching. When it plays well, it's a fun, cliche-riddled, superhero romp. When it doesn't, it takes me back to the Skyrim days of yore (sans the seizure-having dragons that follow you when you fast travel). It's a fun game, though the microtransaction bit does cheese me off, but at the least it's cosmetic and I'd be lying if I said I haven't picked up a couple of cosmetics just for chuckle or aesthetic reasons.

All in all, I'd give the game a solid 8/10. It'd be an easy 9/10 if the game didn't have the amount of bugs that it does. I sincerely hope that the Avengers have a pest control expert on speed dial. They're in DIRE need of it. 

Also Black Widow is Black Widow and not an ineffectual tart in tight pants that gets cozy with Robin Hood/not-as-charming Gordon Ramsay.",1599440088,1599440088,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198068705446,949,4,5872,297,2703,1601134550

In addition I have a decent pc and it passes the recommended requirement by a lot, but the game still crashes every so often. Idk its fun but not worth 60 bucks.

I am constantly falling out of the map and you have to quit the mission and rejoin and you might be on the ground again. Also in cut scenes some characters dont load in.

28,75570963,english,"I think the game has a lot of potential. I like the RPG aspects such as leveling up your characters, gaining abilities as you play them more, getting gear with special effects that you can also level up using in game currency, and I think the developers executed well in that respect. The level scaling and tree seem really BIG.  They added a lot of fan service with lots of fun skins, a really compelling campaign with interesting character interactions and development. The fighting is pretty good but has it flaws. The fighting is pretty fluid, going between ranged, melee, special abilities feels really good. Sometimes the fighting can get weird, and you'll have a hard time, but I think that's something you can manage with game knowledge and practice.  the animations are great, and the movement is pretty good, but can be a bit jarring/clunky at times (jumping hulk, zipliing with kamala and BW are the most glaring). Sometimes the camera gets frustrating and you can lose your character in tight corners or with debris. 

I have not reached the end game, but can imagine it being similar to instanced missions (similar to campaign) where completion gives certain rewards, xp boosts, and rare currency. There seems to be potential for a lot of late game with the level scaling,  associated abilities, and interesting gear which can really effect how you play. As far as a beat em up game, the fighting I found to be pretty difficult, but there are a lot tools that I think you can polish to really give you sense that you can get ""good"" with your characters. I do imagine the late game getting repetitive, unless they add more levels, gear, and characters ->  which is my hope and expectation. 

As an avid fan of both Marvel and beat em up games like UMA, I really want to recommend this game, but unfortunately I cannot. The game is quite buggy. Animations and player movement can get really weird. I've had Cpt. America's eyes fall out of his head with some skins, and sometimes you don't grab ledges or walls. Easily my biggest complaint/bug has lead to my campaign being SOFT-LOCKED at approx. 80%. There is no way for me to resolve this issue in game and it looks like I'll have to delete game files to fix it meaning I'd have repeat a lot of content. I don't intend to do so, and am hoping that the developer fixes their game quickly. My campaign will remain incomplete, which to a completionist makes me not want to continue playing at all. I will check out the late game just to see, but unless the developer fixes their buggy game and promises to add more content/support, I'm afraid it will be a short lived adventure. 4/10",1599438764,1599438764,False,4,0,0.544881045818328857,0,True,False,False,76561198082222195,47,4,5299,0,1058,1600539762

Things aren't looking too hot; my allies are down, the enemies were surrounding me, and I was on my last inch of health. What was I going to do? Was there a way out of this? At this moment, I pictured the events of the incredible Hulk #69 in my head. You see in this issue, Hulk had to grind 8 hours in order to obtain the cryo plasma rib cage. Once he equipped it, he was finally able to defeat the generic soldiers that blocked his way. Now, back to me playing, I look through my inventory and find that I didn't have any good rib cages to equip. Darn! BUT WAIT! I had the Next best thing! After sorting my lunchbox, I find a lightning gamma spinal cord. YES! Once I equipped it, I finally smashed the generic nameless robots that kept pummeling me to the ground.

43,75560514,english,"I was very skeptical about this game, even way before launch back last year, but with no expectations, no beta play and only watching the wartable video before launch. I came around and bought the game since i wanted an alternative to Destiny 2 & Division 2. 

So far i've played this for the past few days (as of now) over 15hrs on record still going through the campaign. With some occasional internet disconnections (doesn't affect solo play), though this might be my wi-fi antenna. Overall i'm liking the single player storyline. The cost of the deluxe version seems unnecessary unless you really want those Obsidian skins (that's the only benefit i can see even owning it)

Gameplay is quite good i do like to include the AI controlled party when i launch missions that offer the option. Some missions do get a bit chaotic and difficult when you don't have many abilities unlocked in the early part of the campaign. 

The campaign is mostly centred around Kamala Khan Ms Marvel, and all the better for it, It's great for the story arc. You do get to use the other characters along the way so it works out.

With cosmetics being unlockable in the game, i'm not so concerned with the hard currency cosmetic storefront. It's there like every other Game as a Service. if there's an item or two you're interested and willing to pay up then go ahead, otherwise it doesn't affect game play whatsoever.

Pros:
- Solid single player campaign, keeps me engaged. Performance is great.
- Beautiful story cinematics even when rendered in-game.
- Every character plays differently, controls are mostly consistent. Introductions to those characters & their move sets are predictable but helpful.
- Xbox One Controller support on PC seems on point. (disable steam overrides if you have issues)

Cons
- Inventory Management: Lack of ability to switch to other characters inventory / profile to adjust their equipment & cosmetics in solo campaign ++edit++ selecting allies in mission launch window as active playable character enables edit, but seems convoluted ++ (i don't think that is the case with multiplayer but i haven't dived into that yet.)
- Large crowds can end up getting chaotic so you do need to retreat to recover before diving back in.
- Occasional minor visual glitches. (hair animations, characters talking and lips not moving, camera jumping around a bit in non-mission areas [area specific])
- Some Side Missions seem a bit short, being in an isolated facility. Maybe add an additional levels to them, add a few more encounters.

Other Thoughts
- Physical Appearance: Gear doesn't affect appearance of character when equipped, but i can let this one slide
- Graphics tweaking enabled me to get consistent framerate with no problems, Running in 2K instead of 4K, enabling AMD Scaling & Nvidia HBO+ (running on a custom adjusted version of High) Took me awhile to get the right balance.

Glitches
- Initial ALT+TAB crash for GTX 10 series [resolved]
- Occasionally encountered a character's skeleton being stuck in mission debrief areas in an unnatural pose, instead of performing it's animation cycle (ie supposed to be doing a task, but ends up standing like a stick on an angle)

67,75521144,english,"So let me start by saying that the story in this game is incredible. Although it's only 10-12 hours of story it's very good. The game isn't lackluster by any means, but I did not enjoy my time playing through this game for a few reasons. Now before you nerds get a major raging hate boner, let me explain. The combat is good, but overall it gets repetitive. You fight the same three sets of enemies throughout most of the game, until you get to the final part of a mission then it throws in a few other types of enemies. It's not very fun fighting the enemies, it's just more of chore. The combat is very slow and clunky. Most of the time it felt like moving through a thick river of honey to get to the enemy and when you got to the enemy it felt like hitting them with a wet noodle. Most of the main missions and side missions are all pretty much the same where you stand on a plate for about six minutes fighting waves of enemies or killing high target enemies and it's just boring. The multiplayer is alright. It is fun to play with a/or friend(s), but is anyone really excited about two superheros clapping each others ass's ? Nope not really. The biggest problem about this game is how it runs. I'm able to max out every setting on any game, but this one. You need to run the game in Medium and turn V-sync off (obviously) and the DPS setting in order for the game to run smoothly or the game will crash every 10 minutes. Overall I'd by this game for the story and that's it.

My first impressions were that this game is fantastic. It's got the right level of sillyness, an interesting story (even if it's a bit predictable, but meh). Combat is solid - it changes between each hero which is good; not just x to light punch, y to heavy punch, b does hero spesh - each hero has their own skill set and play style.

The skill tree system gets quite overwhelming at lv15 but it's easy to manage once the penny drops.

Gear is very much a looter shooter style. Lots of gear, lots, but it's upgrade-able and the extra effects are usually noticeable. 

Not knowing much about her I was dubious about Kamala Khan as the main character, specifically her powers - on the face they just seemed a bit meh but I'm so glad I was wrong. She's a brilliant fit for the main line role. Suitably ""plucky teen"" but not in your face and unbearable, she's not just there to go ""omg it's iron man"" she pulls her own weight, helps each of the avengers out with their issues, all the while dealing with her own mental wellbeing problems (all alone, can't see her family, isn't good enough etc). There's a lot of hate for her (mostly because she's not a white dude) but from what I've read it just seems to be insecure tools that wanted to play a male character; or people that don't like that she's Muslim and makes 2 minor references to it...

I think my only gripe is the side mission stuff and faction missions. They very much feel tacked on but in the same way they are in Destiny 2 - they're there but you can ignore them, then realistically you just miss out on some cosmetic stuff, you can find decent gear by exploring. I can also see the missions getting repetitive but Square have promised loads of additional free content so I'm not fussed.

Then there's the microtransactions. Ignore what the moaners are saying - they have almost zero effect on the game past cosmetic; and everything buyable is earned in game with a bit of a grind - maybe a few weeks of playing a couple of hours a week for each character to unlock everything, (assuming they don't add more). Nothing like the grind on some mmos. I suppose you can spend cash to unlock some upgrading materials saving yourself about 15 minutes of play time per character... So frankly if folk want to spend loads of cash doing that, let them - they're fools...

Finally.  Yes, there's bugs. Some weird ones that make the game stutter and lag a bit. I disabled a couple of things in the graphics settings and it works fine. I've not got the best pc in the world either - it just meets min spec, sure the game isn't as pretty as it could be but it still looks great on the low setting.

Overall, I'd give this game a solid 9/10. It's ace, worth the £50 I spent on it. I'd spend it again in a heartbeat. I'm really looking forward to the multiplayer aspect, even if it's just more repeatable missions! The devs did a great job with this game and I'm sure they'll continue to support it for a damn good while!

76,75567458,english,"**Spoilers at the bottom of my review**

I've played 22 hours of this game so far and I have mixed feelings about it. The story is good and I have enjoyed it so far which is why I recommend it, but, the enemy scaling seems to not exist. I set the game on hard difficulty because I normally enjoy challenging combat to go along with a story but the enemies seemed too powerful, especially for a hard difficulty so I set it down but it didn't seem like it got any easier at all. I have enjoyed hulk a lot and I have played him most of my time on the game but he seems very, underwhelming. He doesn't do that much damage and he can be killed very easily. Which is odd for a character which is seen as an absolute unit and a powerhouse on the avengers. Certain enemies kill you so fast they feel like bosses which is weird because they are casual enemies that come up in most levels through out the game. And he does as much damage as almost any other character that you get to play as. I feel like this is mainly an issue with the item/armor system. 

Your base stats set you to around 100-200 in each stat when you start which is fine but as you increase the melee damage or range damage it doesn't really seem to change that much. You can check your stats and see that the stat changed and whatnot but it seems to make no difference. I think this system would work better if 1, they gave certain characters, such as hulk for example. More default stats in Melee Damage and Defense and less in Ranged. Or Black Widow for example, more in Melee and Ranged and less in defense. Or 2, actually made the gear do something, as currently as it seems to me really doesn't change your actual damage or health. And even if it does some enemies will still absolutely drain your health even if you do increase your defense rating.

Other than that the game has a bit of bugs which is to be expected for a game that has just came out of release. A lot of the times when I use hulk's thunderclap the audio just cuts out and it's really underwhelming when there's no audio and all you see is hulk clapping his hands together with a ton of green effects around you and these happens with some other moves with almost every hero but normally the audio seems to be fine. The movements seems to be strange at some times but otherwise it's nothing a few bug fixes couldn't change.

This game seems to have a lot of potential and as long as they keep updating the game with fixes to the gear system and enemy scaling I expect this game to be pretty good at the end of the day. And the developers seem to have an idea of the content they want to release in the future of this game. I believe I have seen something about them talking about adding Black Panther, Doctor Strange, Hawkeye and a few other heroes I believe in the future which is exciting. As well as Spiderman but he will only be added to the PlayStation Edition. 

Overall the game isn't bad, this game seems to have a lot of potential and as long as they keep updating the game with fixes to the gear system and enemy scaling I expect this game to be pretty good at the end of the day and I hope they release even more content.

**Spoilers**
I didn't make this to spoil the game but mainly to go over the skins of the game.

I went into this game a bit on the negative side.  Spider-man is locked to Playstation, which means there's an experience I won't get to see on PC for the same price.  But, considering that was my biggest gripe about the game I decided to jump in over the last 2 days and play it.

So, story wise it's a rudimentary story about a young girl named Kamala Khan, or Ms. Marvel(she's a Captain Marvel fan) joining the Avengers and saving the day.  It's your typical comic-book style story with over the top bad guys attempting to do something rather awful.  The story isn't great, but it does a decent job of pushing the narrative and giving the characters some dialogue with each other.  If you know nothing about the Avengers, or much of Marvel characters, you'll have a decent amount of collectibles and lore to read through that will give you a better idea of the world around you.

Gameplay is a mixed bag.  Combat gets better over time as you unlock various skills and combos from the skill tree, but it's mediocre at best.  Each superhero fights in the way you'd expect for the most part, but they feel awfully similar at times.  Even worse is you have a rather small assortment of enemies that you'll encounter.  If you have a passion for killing robots, then you'll probably manage to enjoy the combat before it gets too stale.  Otherwise you might wish for some variety within a few hours.

Levels... Or the lack there of.  There simply aren't many.  You have your HARM missions which are visually unappealing and boring wave attacks.  There's a slight change to variety after you finish the campaign, but overall HARM missions were easily my least favorite missions.  The main campaign missions aren't terrible, but they're essentially the same mission in a slightly different location until the latter quarter of the game.  Go here, defend this, or defeat that, or destroy these objects.  There are some ""side"" objectives to rescue people, fight tougher enemies, and collect gear during the main missions, but they're largely forgettable.  The iconic missions for each character have good openings, and fail to follow up on them entirely.  Maybe those stories will be more of the upcoming content, I'm not sure.

Gear... Well, this is a looter game if you weren't aware.  Collect gear that is increasingly better as you play.  Complete various challenges to unlock your rank that in turn allow you to unlock new cosmetics.  Everything is achievable without purchasing anything through the in game store, but it's right there at the limit to encourage the ""I don't have time for that, here's my money,"" that has no place in a game you paid $60 for.  That being said, the cosmetic outfits are pretty decent and varied.

That brings me to how the game looks.  It's pretty.  Character animations are typically pretty good, though there are times it looks like you're walking with a diaper on.  Facial animations occasionally get stuck and you'll see Black Widow with a permanent scowl on her face.  Environments look ok, but are mostly bland and lifeless.  I guess Utah looks like that in real life in some places, but they made it exceptionally boring here.

Music, voice, and sound range from forgettable, admirable, and acceptable.  I can't remember a single tune from the game, but the voice actors all did an exceptional job for their characters.  Sound effects are pretty much what you'd think they ought to sound like.

It's a decent superhero brawler with loot, all things considered.",1599429341,1599429341,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,76561197970539229,9984,171,953,0,733,1600041642

22,75473711,english,"I love the Avengers and was so excited to play this. I thought oh maybe another Spider-Man??!! Nope, not even comparable. People who say it resembles it are lying. This is a bullet hell beat'em'up button masher. There were like 3 or 4 unique missions in the campaign the rest was copy and paste do the same thing over and over. The online missions are the same thing over and over. Go here fight robots hit switch, go there fight robots hold position. This is basically the whole game. 

The levels can be semi open to run around but its basically platform diarrhea with just random platforms scattered all over so you can pick up 6 fragments (one of the many currencies) which is nothing. I played on hard and the balancing is just trash. It is either all or nothing with this game. You can be way over leveled or way under to the point you have to grind and grind to level up all the characters one at a time. It is sooo boring. Of course you have to grind to get outfits OR you can spend $20 real money for ONE!  

There are TONS of bugs. Caps face is falling apart when you wear certain outfits. Clipping, getting stuck, no audio in scenes, extreme frame drops (and i have a good PC), getting stuck in menus cause the back button vanished. I had this bug where the game would disable my wifi! For real it would literally disconnect my internet then I get a constant "" You are offline"" message that takes up 25% of the screen. You see they want you online and hooked to their site so they can sell you garbage. 

All in all this game lacks imagination and compelling storytelling. The main character Ms. Marvel is a PC whiny baby. The whole story is her just pouting about everything. Waahh I have super powers, waaahhh the avengers are arguing. 

The fighting CAN be engaging SOMETIMES, but mostly its just mashing buttons while trying to dodge the millions of particle effects trying to hit you. Even when high level you feel weak against almost all the enemies. I mean can you imagine the Hulk being beat down by a tiny bipedal robot? Well get ready cause its going to happen a lot. All the heros feel this way. Like we are supposed to just forget these are OP superheros. They ask us to suspend too much disbelief. The exception I guess is Thor's hammer. Its pretty awesome, but only when throwing. It sucks with melee. 

The loot balance is trash. You loot and loot and loot and when you finally get something decent you find it takes 25% of your melee strength away in favor of 5% defense. This game was made for one reason and one alone cash. There is no heart in this game. It is just a hollow shell for which to drain our pockets. I have no urge to ever play this again. There are just too many better superhero games out there that do it WAY better. 

This game is not worth it for $60 and I feel stupid for paying for deluxe. I'll be passing on this devs games in the future. Just boring trash. Maybe 4 hours of fun before you realize its the same thing over and over. 

Positives ---- Looks good in cutscenes. (the levels are all the same robot factory industrial looking ugly grey mess)

I'd pass on this one or wait until its $10 on sale. Then maybe its worth it if you have literally nothing else to play and the world is ending. :)",1599296107,1599427685,False,3,0,0.504950463771820068,0,True,False,False,76561198173274755,143,5,1441,0,1441,1599208289

Gameplay otherwise is pretty solid for me. Cap and Black widow are really fun, Iron Man can play as a C-130, Thor is a beast, and Hulk still isn't Omega level but he has some good combos. Game seems tuned for Kamala, she's very easy to play and is quite decent. 
----------------------------------------------------------

Game design is a lot like Destiny or The Division. It's a Marvel shooter/brawler-looter with decent production values and cosmetic micro-transactions. There's quite a bit to unlock with each character, it's deeper than it looks at first glance. You don't really have to worry about builds much in story mode, but there's definitely potential here for play-style complexity. Lots of combos to discover. 

You can form strike teams of up to 4, and the harder difficulties will probably require the standard dps/support/tank archetypes. 

It's a little buggy, with some jank in animation and movement, but I've only CTD'd twice so far. The animations can drop to low-fps on a whim, and I think there's a memory leak as my performance (RTX 2080S, Ryzen 9 3900X) degrades over time. 

The heroes are actually better than I expected from the previews, except for Hulk. He looks great, but they did Hulk dirty just like in the MCU. He's just not an Omega level dude like he is in the comics. 

Dialogue and acting is OK. Some characters are done better than others, but nothing really to complain about except for Hulk's weakness and Tony Stark's corny quips (""Less talky more fighty [sic]""). The villains are done well, which can be the most important thing in a comic adaptation.

Pros: 
-Loot system. Very destiny-like and finding the perfect syngeries between loot and preferred abilities is super fun.\

-Story is A++
-Voice Acting from Bruce and Kamala in particular is phenomenal
-Combat can be very fun once you get the hang of things. It take a while to really learn everything and can be frustrating when you dont understand why you're getting sniped out of the air.

Cons:
-Bugs. This game has so crazy bugs in it. Nothing that can't be fixed in a future patch, but I have had to restart my game more than 10+ times due to being caught in nonplayable zones, sound dropping out, and or other things
-Cap's mobility is god awful compared to other heroes. Apart from wanting to be cap there'd be no reason to pick him. Can't get a lot of world loot due to abilities and lack of verticle mobility.

My biggest concern was the story was going to be hijacked by devs wanting to fill out checkmarks for their pat on the back at the cost of story and gameplay. Not the case at all what so ever. So far the story is great, the game itself is very enjoyable and it offers wide variety of gameplay. This is for sure a game setting that can be expanded upon and Square Enix was a good choice for devs. In addition, going to be blunt: their Bruce Banner is better than Mark Ruffalos for sure in terms of how he's handled thus far and I appreciate how much care went into the characters of this game. It does a great service to upholding the integrity of source material for how these characters would behave.

Pros
-Great characters
-Fun gameplay
-Something you can pick up and just enjoy casually or even hard core
-Has great RPG elements

Cons
-Graphical bugs
-Gameplay glitches here and there
-Exclusivity of Spider Man isn't a good move and I hope this changes soon.

53,75563322,english,"It's pretty, and that's about where the positives end for me. The campaign dialogue is horrendous. Things like the character not reacting to the events going on around her is just awful. Early on, you're tasked with collecting 5 comic books to get into the VIP section of an event. Pretty dumb, but okay. You get your first comic book and the main character says something like ""I got the first comic book!"" The cutscene ends, and she again says ""alright, I got the first comic book! Now I need to go get the next comic book."" It's just repetitive, exposition filled lazy implementation that doesn't seem to care about presentation. 

After she gets another one of the comic books, there's a kinda dark and serious moment. When it's over, she again exclaims ""yay! I got the next comic book!"" as if she didn't just witness what happened. 

The first hour or two is just... bad. I struggled to get through because I was told there was looting RPG elements. I told myself I would ignore the really bad plotting and dialogue. It honestly doesn't get better, and the loot system isn't very good. 

Movement is clunky, the ""puzzles"" are uninspired and boring, and the combat is okay at best. 

I do want to commend the main character's voice acting. I think the dialogue is bad, but she does a good job and is believable.

First off I have to say this was such a horrible job from a studio like Crystal Dynamics and Square Enix, 𝓉𝒽𝒾𝓈 𝒾𝓈 𝒶 𝓃𝑒𝓌 𝒾𝓅 is not a valid excuse. This game was such an unoptimised nightmare. Visually looks horrible, gameplay wise, it's utterly shameful for ripping off Warframe, Anthem and Destiny alike. Only way this game could be better is to have a complete overhaul in terms of every aspect of the game, even Campaign could've been better.

I had no idea Marvel could shamelessly stoop this low after making something like Spiderman for PS4.

Matchmaking doesn't even work at times, the game is filled with game breaking bugs and errors that fatally pushed me to rage quit at times.

But, nevertheless it does get kind of fun after you start leveling up and unlocking certain perks and such as every other games in the market. To be honest, this game doesn't offer anything new, just another generic role-playing game on the market that can be a complete waste of time if you're looking to get into something serious and worth your while.

80,75561026,english,"It's not terrible, though I wish I'd waited until it was half off or so.

I haven't played a great deal of the game, but what I've seen so far seems like the devs went all out for mediocrity.  

Technical issues aside (with the settings turned to low the game only crashes every few hours), I'm chiefly irritated that the campaign wants to walk you through a story, but doesn't care at all about making the story good.  It's fine to have a weak story in a game that's about smashing things, but you can't then decide to slow-walk the player through said garbage narrative instead of letting us smash things.  

After waiting 2 hours for the game to download, I was ready to get in the action and smash things.  Nope.  The movement tutorial isn't a couple minutes of the basics, you follow Lady Dhalsim on her quest to collect 5 comic books at the Avengers Expo so she doesn't have to sit in the cheap seats while she waits to find out how she did in the fanfic competition.  Instead of just letting you get the comics and move along to smashing things, the event has false leads, cut scenes where she runs into Avengers where they're nice to the fans, and  generally things that aren't fun or interesting on the way to the main event.  

Then everything goes to crap, and you play as each of the 5 main avengers while they try to protect San Francisco from bad guys and ultimately fail, setting up the ""plot.""  I found I really liked how Captain America played in the single room he fought a couple waves of bad guys in, and I was looking forward to jumping into the action with him.

Nope.  We then find out that after their loss results in a semi-defined catastrophe which also gives Dhalsima her super-powers, the public has turned on the Avengers and now the remnants of Stark industries have been turned into the quasi-governmental agency AIM, which is inexplicably led by the guy that was in charge of the project that caused all the problems.  How this guy not only escaped accountability but also got everyone to say ""Yeah, we don't see a problem with making this guy a mini-dictator"" is beyond me.

So we get to see his world for a little bit as we're now playing Dhalsima through platforming sections where you run and jump and grab distant poles.  No fighting.  Then comes the stealth section no one asked for as Dhalsima, equipped with absolutely no stealth tools waits patiently behind barriers and walls until enemies look the other way.   No distracts, lighting mechanics, nothing but sheer boredom as Square Enix fails to understand what actually makes stealth games fun.  I suppose it makes sense that the people who thought I bought Avengers to hide from things also didn't think they needed to consult anyone who'd ever actually played a stealth game.  So I blundered through it, since there's no penalty for dying I didn't try very hard to avoid getting surrounded by robots and captured.  And at the end, Dhalsima escapes the bad guys to immediately get captured by their leaders, leading to a cut scene where she escapes.  Oh sure, that should have been the logical result of all the other times I got caught, but that would've deprived me of the joy of playing through the entire stealth section with no stealth tools.  And then later she just says screw it and fights the robots, which begs the question of why a person capable of beating up rooms full of robots just surrendered 10 minutes earlier every time a robot saw her and called his two buddies.

They obviously did put a lot of effort into making sure the tutorial sections extended past the Steam refund period.  Even after you get into the main game where you play characters you've actually seen before, there's a lot of gratuitous drudgery as your home base is in a terrible state of disrepair, and you'll have to run around it reconnecting wires and flipping switches while you very slowly unlock each Avenger.  

Honestly, core gameplay is pretty fun when the controls are responsive (dodging and vaulting seem to require you to press B for some specific length of time maybe?  I can't quite figure out why they only sometimes work). but the sheer insipidity of the first few hours made me feel like they should be paying me rather than the other way around.  

Dhalsima is there primarily to keep you hyped, her entire personality consists of her enthusiastic adoration of the Avengers.  Her wide-eyed excitement actually is charming, but it's still disappointing when you roll away a rack to get the loot hidden behind it and are rewarded only with her awe at finding Tony Stark's guitar.  

It feels like the game was designed by management with the old MMO approach of dangling rewards distantly in front of the player in order to keep them playing and never stopping to ask if the gameplay is actually fun.  I don't mind story in games, Dragon Age 2 is probably my favorite game of all time, but if you're going to go heavy on narrative, it's a good idea to actually give the narrative some modicum of quality as well as a connection to the gameplay.",1599421569,1599421569,False,0,0,0.494296550750732422,0,True,False,False,76561198119116443,226,3,2091,33,1002,1600903671

89,75560358,english,"This game is many different things to many different people. I'm no one special but here's what I know, and that I can share with all of you.

1 - I played the Beta, it was very buggy and crashy. Now, playing the day-one-release, I experienced 2 NPC related bugs in the first minutes...and after that...not a single bug or crash for the next 10 hours.
Considering the fixes since the Beta were most likely being done in a remote ""work from home"" scenario for the most part, I can assume they are taking this production seriously.

2 - I've only ever seen images of Ms.Marvel with oversized hands, so I don't know much about her at all. However her powers in this game are awesome and worthy of a junior Avenger. The story also develops her into an endearing character...even though her excessive Voice Overs can become annoying, but that can be adjusted with time and player feedback.

3 - The fighting style of every character is REALLY cool and fun to play. They feel really good in your hands...except for Ironman. It could just be me, but I'm not feeling it. Which is sad for me because I love Ironman. His parry needs some tweeking. Also, he's a better fighter in the air, but his flying is rough AF. Sad.

4 - With enough engagement from the community, I would imagine that they might continue to put resources into this game's development and with time and continued work, they just might be able to deliver an extended user experience that will be fun for every gamer who lives it and grows with it. (That weak DLC for $26.99 is not a good way to start though. Price too high, DLC too empty.)

The graphics are realistic and true to the comics/movies. You get a wide variety of cosmetics so you can tailor the characters to your liking. The missions can be done solo or multiplayer. Multiplayer can take longer as you need to wait for someone to join lol find some friends to avoid wait times or use companions.

Missions are made up of a large area that you can move around freely (think skyrim or witcher) the only load screens come as you use the elevator. You can repeat character missions and there are daily/faction quests you can do to gain reputation, gear, and currency (disassemble old gear). 

I've played for 16hrs and I have no complaints.

34,75549583,english,"Pros:

Character Designs: Characters feel unique in their skill sets, every character feels different to play and has a variety of different tools to interact with the environment. Some can hack to open doors, other use brute force. It's interesting enough. 

Co-op: When you do find a group of people to play with, it's incredibly enjoyable this is definitely a game you want to play with people rather than yourself. 

Cons:

Campaign Length: The campaign is horribly short, between 10-12 hours just doing the story maybe a bit less depending on your skill. 

Side Quests: They're incredible boring, the game rotates 3-5 mission types that become very repetitive. All involving go to point A, either play king of the hill with 4 points, kill 5 strong enemies, or destroy 4 objects all whilst spawning waves of enemies to fight as well. That's it, that's literally all there is endgame. No mission is unique bar the ""Iconic Missions"" which again just involve you doing the above but you get an outfit at the end of the side mission. 

Gameplay: Whilst the character designs are fun, the whole game is hindered by ranged attacks. I expect a lot of people's response to this is ""Get good or learn to play."" However you can never get a flow in the game, 90% of the enemies in this game have a ranged attack which staggers you interrupting any combo you're doing, this attacks are all lock on based as well, so good luck trying to fly around as Thor or Iron man without getting staggered mid-flight and dropping to the floor. 

Console exclusivity: More of a personal point, but I thought it was bad enough spiderman was only on PS4 but they limit outfits on the marketplace as well, PS4 gets exclusive outfits for the first 30 days. Meaning there's even less content on PC which it is already lacking heavily. 

Microtransactions: A lot of the outfits in the game can be unlocked by playing, however they're either purchased via the shop for units. The legendary outfits cost 7500 units, of which you get about 6-30 per mission depending on how many boxes you open per mission. So it takes a long time to purchase. You also receive outfit schematics after doing certain missions which you can decipher. However these are all random chance are you're going to get an outfit you dont want for a character to don't play much.

Outfits: Most outfits are just recolours. There is so much potential in this field however they got very lazy. This is purely just to fill space for the schematics mentioned above to keep you playing the game for the late game grind. 


Overall: I'm sure there are points that I've missed, however this is a big regret of a purchase. Whether this is because of the way gaming is going forward with games a service rather than just a game. I would very much hold off until it goes on sale.

This game had such huge potential. I'm very disappointed to see it wasted. I really wanted to like this game.",1599406772,1599416008,False,7,0,0.535440027713775635,0,True,False,False,76561198028643479,120,3,1883,20,1624,1601216010

66,75554343,english,"I'm really enjoying this game but I can't recommend it in it's current state.

Pros:
- The story is pretty good. The missions are fun through the campaign and it's nice to see some familiar Marvel faces.
- The locations are really nice. Most of them are pretty expansive and detailed and allow for a lot of 3 dimensional movement.
- The abilities and build possibilities are fun.
- The current roster is great. I can't wait for them to add more characters.

Cons:
 - This is basically a single player game right now. Matchmaking might as well not even be present as it doesn't work 90% of the time and when it does work it causes crashes or infinite loading screens.
- Crashes in general. I've crashed solo, with a team, in a menu, afk. You name it and the game has crashed during it. At least you get to keep the loot you've gathered but if you need to complete the mission you just have the bite the pillow and saddle up.
- Crashing in multiplayer can increase the level difficulty for those that are left in the party. Sometimes this isn't so bad because the game will get them 3 additional heroes. Why? Who knows.
- Endgame is just grinding. What are you grinding? Well it's whatever is fastest at the moment because the loot gained from completions or during the mission is random. Complete that elite hive on challenge 4? Here is your 4* purple. For the record purple is the 3rd highest rarity and everything goes up the 5*.
-  Loot is random. You get random stats, random perks and a random amount of each. It's also random where you get them.
- Despawning enemies. I've had enemies that I had to kill to progress a mission despawn in front of my eyes. Whole teams just gone and no way to fix it other than abandon the mission and hope for the best next time.
- Hive elevators do not load properly sometimes and cause you to reload a checkpoint or just fall infinitely. I left the game running one time while falling. Came back after making a sandwich and I was still hard at plummeting into the abyss.
- Skills not working properly. I've used black widows invisibility and ran into a room to hack a terminal and been instantly shot at or had enemies run up to me and attack me. I've also had this happen while not hacking a terminal and just running around the map. BW has an ability to always crit when invisible and attacking from behind. It's kind of useless because even when invisible everything turns to face you no matter if you are hitting it or not.
- Every enemy with a ranged weapon is Hawkeye. I've run around from fighting behind cover to instantly being hit in the face with a rocket/laser/omni tracking heat seeking ball buster projectile. Check it out! They have independently targeting particle beam phalanx. Vwap! Fry half a city with this puppy. They got tactical smart missiles, phased plasma pulse rifles, RPGs, they got sonic electronic ball breakers! They got nukes, they got knives, sharp sticks... I wish as an avenger that I could take half the punishment that these guys can and still follow through with an attack. Some of the rockets they shoot will follow you like herpes unless you make it hit something other than yourself or yourself, that also works.
- Most costumes available are just one costume with 3 different color schemes. 
- The cash shop is expensive and there is no guarantee that you will get what you pay for. There are instances of the game eating cosmetics.

That's all I can think of for now. I've completed 94% of the story and there is no indication of what the last 6% is. I've also completed the 14 floor elite mega hive which was just long and boring.

So I played beta a little bit. Didn't even get through the second campaign because the game couldn't hold my interest with the absence of character building, over-the-top screen shakes, and horrible framerate issues. No wonder some people might shy away from this game due to beta experience.

Official launch though, I gotta say I'm impressed with how fast the dev team fixed this thing. Good core gameplay mechanics and fun combat. Each character plays differently and I love playing each of them. The more you level, the more cool skills you can unlock. And you really gotta work for each and every character you wanna play 'cos you only get xp and gears for the character you are currently playing. Those companion AIs you bring along gain nothing. I experienced some model glitches during my 30 hours and, except for 2-3 CTDs, no game breaking bugs for me. The worst one I got was this one flying enemy stuck inside an elevated block but Thor managed to zap them to death after a while. Annoying but nothing that required restart. CTD is super annoying though 'cos it means you gotta start the mission again from scratch (with the saving grace that you get to keep all the loots you found before crashing).

Solid campaign, too, albeit a bit short. 19 hours including doing some side missions for costume. (Yes, they are using a very cliche trope but they managed to deliver it with good writing. You may not like how they 'over-geek' Kamala Khan if you read her comic but I am ok with this transition. In fact, as a Marvel fangirl myself, I am loving it.) Post-campaign is all about gearing/leveling up and collecting cosmetics. Microtransaction is just an option to unlock some skins, nameplates, and emotes without actually working for it. At this time, there is no pay-to-win. Can't say much about multiplayer facet as I don't have the patience to wait for matchmaking and always just opt to go with AIs.

Playing the game on a 2090ti and after 45min-1hr the game begins to get jumpy and jittery. Also, w/i that time frame the ability to access the escape key menu, disappears, then there is no way to exit the game other than force shutting it down. Given that there is so much issue with people losing their save data....not ideal.

Addendum:
Given I've gone ahead and played more I just want to add, maybe the aforementioned items are enough for you, if so, fine. But maybe the biggest fkn poop show of all is the persistent crashes, lack of visuals OR sound, during particular cut-scenes. This is truly the biggest shame of all. Not only are there gameplay issues at hand but then you gut the story-telling d/t said glitches, is a real shame. The story is good and deserves to be told, it's a shame that the developer couldn't get out of their own damn way to tell it. 

The dodge mechanic is good and fine but w/ some characters, such as Hulk, you can hardly see the fkn indicators. The input often times feels as if it is not fkn responsive at all. Fights w/ a group of mobs quickly turns into a shit show as you've got heat seaking fkn ranged....everything AND melee mobs. It's just sometimes tedious to play. Story seems fine so far, cut scenes are interesting when they're not jumping around or audio cutting out.

96,75551533,english,"TL;DR - Good game but not recommended at the moment due to bugs, bad optimization and crashes.

Firstly I don't understand the hate this game got before launch, the game is no more money hungry than other games, if anything it's less microtransaction focused than most other multiplayer games.

This is a good beat 'em up looter game which is co-op focused with different mission types you will play in different areas.

+ The ""battlepass"" if you can call it that, on each character is not time limited which is great
+ Good character diversity
+ Game [i]can look[/i] pretty
+ Is a live service game
+ Each character has good amounts of skills to unlock and variation
+ Lots of loot

Now for the cons...

- Optimization. This is the worst optimised game I've EVER played. So many crashes, probably a crash per hour, especially when not playing on lowest settings. 
On my RTX 2080 and i9 10900k I can't run this on anything but lowest settings, and even then barely. Any higher and the fps drops all the way down, stutters, and the game is way more likely to crash.

- Clunky movement and controls. Flying mechanics are terrible, clunky and annoying, landing, moving or turning is a pain.
Normal movement feels cumbersome and like you have little control. Some combos / actions with certain characters just don't work as intended or randomly act weird.

- Knockdowns, stuns, staggers, EVERYWHERE. There are a lot of enemies in this game, and every single one, even the basic ones, can stagger you out of combos or abilities and cancel them or even stunlock you. WHY?

- Bugs. It happens constantly where teammates T-pose, enemies fall through the floor, enemies don't spawn, icons for teammates don't show up and probably more I've forgot to mention

- Terrible UI. UI elements dissapear, menus don't show up in certain places
- No colourblind options
- Has player collision. Why games add this annoying thing puzzles me
- Game is pretty pricey
- Iron Man's skins are garbage",1599409172,1599409172,False,3,0,0.547926545143127441,0,True,False,False,76561198109175044,1128,66,1876,265,1053,1601764660

*Incredible graphics with playable (not outstanding - think 4k30fps) framerate w/ TAA on, ultra settings on a 1080ti / i7 4790k with the intel debris and water settings turned to very high and motion blur off 

*Engaging characters and so far the story has really hooked me

*Gameplay feels good contrary to what I've been hearing - the hits feel heavy and substantial, Hulk smashing stuff feels appropriate - Hulk *SMASH* - mobility with Kamala feels great as well

Now that being said, I hear this turns into a Destiny-esque grindfest, and, look, I'm mad at Destiny, it's not what I wanted, I will probably wash out on this conceptually if it is the same thing at the core, HOWEVER, Destiny left me forever jaded because they *promised me a good story* to drive their world forward and they *never* delivered on that promise, it was an afterthought.  This game *has a great story* that I already care about, I'll see that through and update this review once I hit the backbone of the online game as needed.  

So far, though?  If you love the Avengers franchise, paid to see every movie in the theaters, follow the narrative arc because you've always liked the universe?  Yeah you'll probably enjoy the wow factor here, especially if your graphics card is up to it.  The sets, textures, character design, special effects, all of it is really Avengers-grade spectacle.

22,75549198,english,"Pros:
-Get to play as some of your favorite Marvel Super Heroes.
-Each hero feels like a different experience. 
-Combat is simple but fun. 
-Challenge scales well, no over hard mechanics at first levels get harder with experience
-10-15 hour main story is compelling and feels like a comic book/movie story. 
-Free DLC and Characters coming down the pipeline. 

Meh (Neutral):
-Not attached to MCU characters (I knew this but some think it should be). 
-Mirco-transactions (my philosophy don't buy them if you don't want to).
-Bugs that need to be squashed. I can't think of any game that doesn't have them. 
-There is no need to spend any money on the game past initial purchase, there are even ways to get cosmetics for free. 

Cons:
-Missions can get repetitive.
-Some loot boxes that can't be reached if no one is playing the right character.
-Matchmaking is horrible (but they are supposed to be working on this). 
-Micro-transactions are a little on the expensive side, but seems to be mostly inline with current industry standards 14 us dollars for legendary skin, 12.50 for epic take down, 9 dollars for an epic skin, etc.

27,75548186,english,"Decent graphics, in most parts smooth combat animations, really good voice acting and a captivating story.
Now why did I gave it a negative review? Lets see:
- Animations are sometimes good, sometimes buggy and sometime atrocious, like fast flying with Thor or Tony.
- The game suffers from consolization, meaning that controls, animations, camera movement have been built with console users in mind, so it's basically absolute crap, even after disabling the camera options.
- The campaign is very very short, just a few hours, and it feels like they split the game into chapters so they can sell us some DLCs in the future. It goes very well, and then you suddenly confront the ""big boss"" with some added surprises that are just thrown in there like they couldn't be bothered.
- Not sure about the complexity of games the rest of the reviewers play, but the progression system in this game is about as complex as an empty glass of water. You have combos, that you unlock with XP, not many and not relevant, because making new active skills is hard, you gotta do animations, gotta build an UI to select them, gotta balance, that's boomer shit, right? Then you have a few upgrades to the 3 skills each character has, these upgrades are basically stat increases, nothing fancy. Another example of targeting younger console audience, no builds, no complexity, no gameplay customization, which means no real sense of progression.
- Combat... sure, the heroes are different and that is nice, but for most parts it feels more like a quicktime event than a fight. Yellow and white enemy attack, tap one button, red, tap another button, hit back a bit, rinse and repeat. Again, you really feel the lack of combat diversity very fast.

Conclusion: I was afraid this game would be another Anthem, I was not only proven right, they actually managed to make an even worse game than that. GG

The game also has micro-transactions, I know... however these are just for cosmetic stuff like character skins, emotes and finisher animations. I never really look at those... I have been unlocking a few already randomly by just playing the game.

Attempts at playing coop in the campaign with a friend on Steam is a smoking mess.
It appears that some missions allow coop, while others do not. There is no rhyme or reason to it and no warning other than you simply never get the option to add a friend.
You have to leave Matchmaking off and just hope you see the option to add a friend at some illogical point during mission load-up.
I accidentally ended up in a HARM tutorial while attempting to start a mission, NO idea how that happened,  and trying to kill the Cryo-whatever-bot in the second wave resulted in about a dozen total retries with game settings at EASY.
I imagine it is a tactical issue, but there is NO WAY that the Hulk character should be so easily damaged by an enemy with the game at it's easiest setting. The description for EASY is that you play through with little combat difficulty with the focus on story. 
In one word... B*LLSH*T.
Obviously someone in development wasn't paying attention to balance at various difficulty settings.
Come on guys, get this right... you can do better. 

I am sure things will get better, but my first impression is not very good for a triple-A title like this.
I will give it a thumbs up for now, but if the game continues to frustrate I will most certainly come back and change my rating.

For those that want a quick answer. I can not currently recommend this game. I know some hate negative reviews due to technical reason but if I can not play the game, then I can not suggest or recommend someone else get it and go through the same.

Pro's:
+ Game looks amazing
+ Voice acting is amazing
+ Can feel a good connection between the characters
+ Story thus far is great and fluid 9/10
+ Each team mate feels authentic with there own style.
+ No copy pasting from 1 hero to the next. You will need to learn how to fight with every hero. Being good with 1 does not make you good with another.

Cons's:
- Constant FPS drops, even on high end machines.
- Constant Stuttering issues, even on high end machines
(Lowering graphics for many does not fix the above issues.)
- Memory Leak for many users causing random crashes
- Black screen freezes
- Crashes on start up
- Freeze on loading screen
- Random crashes (Crash to windows with no error message, One of the most common issues)
- Game breaking bugs such as: Not being able to target critical quest elements, stuck in walk mode, events not triggering
- No manual save (This has caused hours of lost game time. 12 hours on record for me. But its actually closer to 4 to 5 hours of game time. When you crash you go back to the previous checkpoint. Sometimes this is 40 minutes prior, depends on the missions.)

91,75538258,english,"While the game itself is a relatively fun beat-'em-up with an interesting story, I'd be a moron if I recommended it in its current state. Shame on me for purchasing on day one.

For the most part, it's the performance. I'm on a 2080 Super, playing at 2560x1080, with most of the taxing settings turned down to medium or high (when applicable, some have ""very high"" and ""ultra"" after ""high""), and I have gone into Nvidia settings - for the first time EVER with game - and messed around with stuff in there. All of this has helped... for about an hour, sometimes less. I assume there's a memory leak issue with the game, as performance degrades over time. I go from keeping 60 to dropping like crazy and entering PowerPoint mode during some animations and/or scripted gameplay moments. If you've played Pillars of Eternity 2 or Horizon: Zero Dawn on PC, you know the level of trash optimisation to expect.

It isn't just the performance, I've encountered a variety of irritating bugs, such as:

- Jarvis having no audio

- Characters having limited to no audio during combat 

- Missing enemy audio 

- Objective / enemy markers appearing far to the left / right of where the enemy (or objective) actually is

- Minor drift while moving - most noticeably as Iron Man, you will occasionally drift while landing or hovering in one direction - I can assume that this is not some kind of inertia feature because there isn't an animation for it; when it happens while landing, he does the ""superhero landing"" pose but carries on sliding forwards

Note: Will edit (if I remember) if these are fixed.

Otherwise, the game is... fine. Combat is fun, the story is interesting so far and I am (surprisingly) enjoying their renditions of the Avengers. I went in expecting to hate them after being treated to a decade of the MCU's brilliance in terms of chemistry and performances. 

The heroes that I've played so far have been enjoyable, I don't particularly like Kamala, but Hulk and Iron Man have felt incredible. I will admit that Hulk's relative lack of damage can be a bit hard to accept - as in, he's huge, but doing bringing both of his arms down H A R D on a regular human's back doesn't obliterate him lul, but overall he's pretty fun.

Having only 6hrs in the game, I can't really comment on the loot game at the moment. It seems... fine, but not as fleshed-out as it could be. For example, you end up getting blue and purple-tier items very early into the game and, as a result, don't end up using them for long because the power level of gear takes substantial jumps. In most other loot games like this, you end up getting legendaries much later on and, because they're legendary, they are often a key part of your build for a significant period of playtime until you get something that you think is better. I also do agree with most of the other reviews on the subject of gear cosmetics... not having gear that changes your appearance is... odd. I'd say they wanted to keep the iconic hero looks intact, but then why have a loot game? You just end up putting on ""stat sticks"" and, even then, you want to be increasing your power level, not necessarily your stats. It just feels tacked-on, at least during levelling. I will edit this section if it changes when I get to the endgame where, presumably, you have reached max power level?

-----------------------------------------

Solid 3rd person action single-player campaign. Some jank in the controls, and having to play as specific Avengers during the campaign is pretty annoying at times. All in all though, I had a great time ~13hr play-through and stuck strictly to the mainline content.

Lots more content here for the grinders and completionists. Which I just happen to be, so... Expecting to invest a lot more hours over the coming months.

24,75532335,english,"I don't usually do reviews but I think because of the blatant hate this game got even before anyone played the Beta, it’s going to need all the reviews it can get from people who have judged it fairly. Before we continue though I’d like to admit that yes I am a huge comic book fan, I own every comic book property video game available on steam and hell I even bought a PS4 for $200 just to play Marvel’s Spider-Man. I’m telling you this so you know who this review of Marvel’s Avengers is coming from, so you can get the whole picture and decide yourself if I'm just biased or if the game really isn't as bad as everyone’s claiming it is. 


First I have to say that personally, I think the question “Is Marvel’s Avengers worth (at the time of this review) the full $60 asking price”, is one that really depends on the answer of another question, a question you have to ask yourself. That question is how big of a Marvel fan are you? Do you religiously read the comics, watch the TV shows (even the ones not or loosely connected to the MCU), do you play any and every game based on a Marvel property? If so then yes, this game is worth it, even if you dislike the way they’ve handled some things such as cosmetics in the game. Now I'm not saying you have to check all of those boxes for the game to be worth it for you, I’ll leave the decision of how many boxes, checked or unchecked, are required to sway you either way up to you but, I think asking yourself those questions is a good starting point. If you’re more of a casual fan, such as you like the movies but that's about it and maybe you haven't even seen all of those then I’d say wait for story updates, DLC, new characters, Raids, etc to be added or if you just need to get it cause you're still interested (just not $60 interested haha) then wait for the winter sale and pick it up at half the price. This game is a lot like Destiny 2 except with lore and a universe people actually care about and I say that as a big Destiny fan. Is it the Marvel game of my dreams? Not at all but it’s certainly at least a step in the right direction. Before this we got MUA 3 the black order, a Nintendo Switch exclusive, and before that? Well that's just the thing, it had been a very long time before that Nintendo game that Marvel fans got a big game set in the Marvel Universe that focused on more than just Spider-man and also wasn’t a LEGO or Telltales game (not dissing them I own all of those too lmao just saying) so I think Marvel’s Avengers is a big step in the right direction for fans who have been waiting for something like this since MUA 2 released 11 years ago. This game gives me my Marvel Ultimate Alliance fix with better graphics, a shit ton of cool, fun skills but at the price of a smaller roster of characters to choose from and some less than ideal amounts of grind/monetization. 

The good about this game is that it’s fun. I know people say it's a mindless action game, and that's arguably true to some degree but so was MUA and XMen Legends,it was the characters that made those games worth playing. You wanted to be Captain America and Wolverine and Ironman and the Hulk and while this game doesn't have ALL those same characters it does let you take control of many of those same heroes but now rendered in HD with cool costumes inspired by the comics so many of us, who preordered this game, love. IronMan feels amazing when flying around large open areas, bombing, blasting and lasering every enemy in sight. The Hulk (once you figure out how to use him and there is a special way he has to be used due to balancing) is a force to be reckoned with, gripping enemies by the legs and slamming them into other enemies PUNY GOD style. Black Widow feels as powerful as the rest of them but with a grace none of them can match, the way she plays is honestly my favorite out of all of them, she just flows so well and when you pull off cool combos as her it's the most satisfying thing ever. Thor makes you feel like a god as you throw mjolnir into enemies, pinning them against the wall as you bash in the heads of their best friends and they’re given no choice but to watch until you call your hammer back to your hand and put an end to their suffering. Captain America is so much fun to play just for the shield alone, throwing his shield at enemies only to kick it right back in their face as it returns to you is just something I dont think I'll ever get tired of doing. And Ms. Marvel is a surprisingly fun addition to the Avengers team, her animations are super cool, sometimes funny and most importantly satisfying to watch as she morphs around the battlefield showing MODOK and AIM where they can shove it. 


Is the game perfect? No it is not, it's buggy as hell, it’s grindy as shit (if you want cosmetics and let's be honest most of us do), and possibly worst of all it’s end game is kind of boring and lackluster right now. So why do I still recommend Marvel’s Avengers? Because I know the bugs will be patched, the grind will likely be fixed because people will definitely continue to complain as many of us reach its end game in the coming weeks/months and the game will get new content, such as raids, new characters, story missions, expansions, gear, costumes, etc some of which Crystal Dynamics has already confirmed. And with all that aside, which dont get me wrong, I get, shouldn't be there to begin with; What you’re left with is a really fun campaign, a great heartfelt comic book coming of age story and possibly one of the best ensemble Marvel games that Marvel fans have had in over 10 years and I for one, am really glad we finally got a new one. Thanks for reading true believers!

I've noticed that a lot of reviews are pre-release, and some of them talk about issues that may have been in error (ie, they didn't know how to play). I figured that I would actually write a review for this game to add my two cents and hopefully give insight to people who are still on the fence. So, I took out a notepad and jotted down (yes, by hand) anything i've noticed so far while playing. This is an in-progress review however and I will update it as I continue playing. I am also a father of 3 kids so it may take some time!

Oh, and for those wondering, I am playing this game on an Acer Predator Helios 300 with a Nvidia GeForce GTX 1660TI and an Intel Core i7-9750H CPU @ 2.60GHZ

[h1]Marvel Avenger's Synopsis[/h1]

Marvel Avengers is new take on our favorite Super Hero universe by Square-Enix. It involves a young girl by the name of Kamala Khan, who is introduced to the player as a young and super-excited avengers fan on her way to meet her heroes for a comic book contest on Avengers day. 

Due to events that take place on this day, Kamala's life, and the life of many others, are forever changed. 5 years later, Kamala, who is is now considered a diseased ""inhuman"", has to make a choice: Does she allow the mob, the press, and the whole world to tell her to move? Or does she plant herself like a tree by the river of truth, following what she believes is right, and tells them ""No. You move.""

[h1]Story[/h1]

The story for this game is honestly solid. Its what I would expect if opening up a comic book that is starting a new arc. I grew up reading comics and im obviously a fan, but I really have enjoyed it so far. Kamala Kahn is a very good protagonist. She acts as one would expect a kid would act in different situations (parents, you know what I mean if youve ever seen a teen in a movie act way out of character). Her voice actress, and honestly all of the voice actors, do a great job. The story, especially the opening, does a very good job capturing the essence of ""awkward kid thats a huge fan"", something many of us have probably experience growing up. The character interactions are believable and the story also has easter eggs for players to find that make you smile when you see it. 

The developers really wanted to introduce their take on the Marvel World with this story, and honestly they did a good job.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]

Marvel's Avengers reminds me of the Batman AA games. Button mashing, while somewhat doable, will get you punished quite easily, especially when facing multiple enemies. You have your basic light and heavy attacks, a ranged attack, power attacks, the ability to evade by double tapping the movement arrows, dodge when indicated (like in Batman AA), and counter. Each hero also has several very iconic abilities that can be used every so often and recharge as time goes on.

The heroes also all have unique ways of interacting with their environment just as you would expect them to do like in the comics or movies. The developers did a good job making each hero feel unique and fun to play. 

Speaking of the gameplay. Several reviews I read mentioned how the heroes seemed weak and how even characters like the Hulk can be interrupted by grunts. I would like to point out a few things with these comments. First, the game makes it very clear that power attacks can interrupt you, which is why you have the dodge ability. I mean, you would think that you should probably dodge a grenade or giant energy ray shot at you, right? Again, not just a button masher. Secondly, the characters are pretty damn strong. You get lots of opportunities to go between heroes during the story and can see very quickly how several difficult enemies for one character are not even an after thought with the hulk. The hulk also has a rage mode where he more or less ignores everything but the strongest attacks and gets health back so....

Oh, last thing on gameplay. I thought it was really cool the the developers added little nods to the characters in their movement and fighting. For example, as Captain America you can manually throw your shield at a wall and it will reflect off at an angle. With practice you can hit enemies that you may miss otherwise. Thor can throw his hammer at one enemy, start fighting another, then summon his hammer back and take out several other enemies that are in the hammers return path. The hulk can increase his travel speed by timing his jumps when he lands. Again, just small little things but very nice touches.

[h1]Sound[/h1]

Good. I mean, it sounds like a marvel movie. The do a good job with the character sounds as well, from things like Thor adjusting the grip on his hammer, Iron Man firing his beams, Hulk breathing (its a thing) and even other minor stuff. I play with headphones so im sure if someone is playing with a high spec sound system it probably sounds even better.

[h1]Graphics[/h1]

I  can see the rise and fall of Hulks chest hair as he breathes. And Black Widow. Oh, and America's Ass. Yeah, graphics are good.

[h1]Performance[/h1]

I listed my laptop's spec's up above. Not the best by any means, yet the game runs great. My laptop doesn't overheat or sound like a jet and the game does well with loading and fighting. I've noticed a few slow downs here and there, and sometimes when loading a new stage or menu it will lag a second, but for a new game my laptop handles it very well.

[h1]Bugs/Issues[/h1]

I have noticed a few bugs here and there while playing. Sometimes the characters mouths stop moving while talking (rare), or the animation may glitch when transitioning from gameplay to an ingame-cutscene (aka not a mini movie). The game has also crashed on my once while waiting for the stage to reload after I had died. Luckily when I started the game back up I was where I left off, but it was a minor annoyance.

I havent had any issues with interacting with objects or the enviroment in game yet, but I will definitly add it if I do.

[h1]Thoughts so far[/h1]

Honestly? I think the game is fun. Even the story mode allows you to team up with other players which is nice. It sounds like the developers plan to release more heroes, missions, bosses, etc for free as well. The  market place cosmetics are pretty limited and on a rotational basis it seems, plus they don't even hound you with going to the in game store, so I feel like the microtransaction issue with this game is non-existent, especially when compared to other games.

The characters look and feel like they should. You can tell the developers spent a lot of time reading the comics and watching the movies. They captured the Avengers perfectly. Yes, I was one of those people who hated the initial reveal because I thought the avengers looked weird, but i can honestly say now that was stupid of me and I should not have judged them like that. They did a damn good job.

If you got the money and you are a Marvel Fan, get it. If you aren't a fan per say but it sounds interesting, get it or wait to get it on sale. So far im having the most fun i've had in awhile with this game, and it seems like its only going to get better.

there is a lot of negativity being said in a lot of reviews about this game some of which i can kind of understand. but I can't really fell it and I have not experienced it.
i am not gunna talk about the negatives cus there is already 10000 posts of people just doing that. and i believe the supposed lack of content will be something that will be addressed in time.
also just note that the people saying ""lack of content"" have already put 40+ Hrs into the game in a few days.
I am gunna focus on what i believe are the positives.
Graphics are awesome. I am running it on a 8700k, 32gb ram, 1070Ti and am running it fine on Max settings and it looks great.
the one thing I love the most is how the characters all play differently. at first they are kind of similar, but as soon as you start levelling them up each really comes into their own and requires different tactics to master.
If you try and just click spam and button mash your way through you will die often and not get far. you need get combos, parry timing, evade timing and counter timing down.
personally i love Black Widow grappling from enemy to enemy, so quick and agile.
there is a lot of depth to the combat that can take a bit to understand.

Overall i love it, I am hoping for many many updates and much future content and enjoying this a lot.

I if am being honest I enjoy this story more than the last two phases of the MCU.

Is there a category for ""best games that were terribly marketed""? Because that pretty thoroughly summarizes the situation with Avengers. As someone who was skeptical leading up to release and who played the beta with reservations - you have to understand that Avengers is actually two interconnected games, and they barely sold the one as even existing. There's a singleplayer campaign that shares some missions with the co-op ""Avengers Initiative"" game in all the trailers, but otherwise is a fairly linear, action-packed story about Kamala Khan reuniting the Avengers after they suffer a devastating defeat at the hands of A.I.M.'s conspiring masterminds.

The plot itself isn't anything deeply profound, but the dialogue and character portrayals are typically top-notch. The RPG-lite progression system doesn't do the campaign any favors, but otherwise, it's a fun time. There is, however, a lot of mechanical nuance to the combat if you take the time to learn each hero's unique ticks. Avengers is far more involved than the ""button masher"" I've heard some accuse it of being - just spamming the light attack won't save your arse when in a higher level raid or against an elite squad of A.I.M. operatives.

That's the remarkable thing about Avengers. It oddly works in spite of its flaws to present something remarkable for both casual and high level play. If you play it on easy, you'll get a playable MCU movie (though it has no narrative ties to the MCU, which is frankly the right call to make). If you dig into the higher difficulties or dare the more challenging missions, there's a meaty brawler-RPG experience that transcends being just another Destiny clone. In fact, I'd say the game it more closely resembles in its scenario design would be Warframe.

So if you'd like Warframe but with Marvel superheroes and a more accessible gameplay/progression design, this is perfect for you. If you want a straight action game, I'd wait for a discount but you can play everything solo and on Easy with capable bot teammates. If you yearn for a new grind, there's plenty of loot with immediately effective stat mods/buffs that can drastically alter your playstyle.

I'll have some more in-depth thoughts on my YT channel which I'll update with a link to when that's ready, but for now?

While this certainly isn't the deepest game play ever, there is a enough complexity for me to stay interested.  It's more than just light attack, heavy attack, block.  That being said, the story is much more reminiscent of (at least in the opening act) an X-Men story, with people with powers being oppressed and and robots being used to hunt them down.  Kamala is interesting, and I certainly like her more than Captain Marvel (That movie was boring, sorry) but she can be really annoying at times.

Not a large enough hero roster.  Hulk definitely feels underpowered and gets stunned far too often or knocked down for being Hulk.  Loot feels generic and not well rewarded.  You get tired of fighting 10 to 15 minutes to clear an area just for one chest.

This game is still fun and I love the Avengers.  This game however needs a lot more work to make it feel worth $60 - $100 plus.

More variety in enemies and not so OP for non boss bottom level enemies.  We need more heroes as a free update.  Large Roster of Heroes I hope some day.  Better and more unique loot or artifacts.  Please make levels more interesting and more variety.  Different base layouts and much harder to infiltrate with more than one or two chests.  Maybe have some boss chests that have several rewards and not just one.  People like to see a ton of epic loot after a hard fight.  Think Borderlands.  This game has a lot of potential.  Listen to the community and I'm certain it could become epic as it should be.

But from what I've learned from Sea of Theives and No Man's Sky, something coming out a little early isn't a death sentence anymore.

This game is good. This game is fun. This game has a REALLY great story that is a wonderful pallete cleanser for a Marvel fan whose had to choke down most of MCU's shlock the last few years. If you enjoy games like Destiny, or Warframe, you'll like what this game has to offer in terms of gameplay loops. And even if you don't the solid beat-em-up structure is definitely enough to entertain those who were interested in the game to start.

However this game is a little premature. It suffers from graphical bugs like particle effects freezing in mid-air, and enemies just up and vanishing. Its multiplayer needs either better servers or just another look at. Overall, it needs another run in the editing room, so to speak.

But with a few updates, hotfixes and bug-checks, this game will definitely something to Marvel at. I would suggest waiting a month or two before picking it up, especially to see if Crystal Dynamics intends on supporting endgame beyond new characters. They've stepped foot in the Warframe/Destiny ring, wherein a game can essentially be endless for as long as the developer is willing to support it. It will just come down to that tricky little ""if""

If you like story-rich games that are so linear that you can't even land wrong without ""dying"" and starting over.  Then this is the game for you.

It's basically Diablo with Avenger characters and a third-person perspective and lots and lots of cutscenes with QTEs.  LOTS of QTEs.  Like... so many QTEs.

Apparently there is more to the game after you finish the main questline... which continuously bats you between the various avengers with little warning or information about how to really use their skills beyond a couple ""click this"" notifications.

The storyline is incredibly predictable.   It's still interesting to watch the character development of a ""new"" avenger.  Even though the cutscenes completely leave out the part about how she discovers she has powers...  which is a true ""thumbs down"" moment right there.  For me at least.

The attacks aren't very varied until apparently later in the game.  At first you get the same basic attacks and fight the same mechanized opponents over and over.  If you can make it through that, you get a lot more options as you level.

Personally I don't think I will.  It's pretty bad in the early stages.

Anyway... this would be a NEUTRAL for me, but I'm going to give it the shadow of the doubt and thumb it down for now.  Maybe after I've played it more I'll have better things to say.  But, at this point it's kind of a lukewarm game.  Nothing new to see here.  Just a very, very linear story and some group missions afterwards.

Gameplay : 
It's fun, even great depending on the character you're using, but repetitive. 
Enemies need more variety. Level design is.. fine. Gear system/ Leveling up is fine.

Story : 
Pretty solid. Just fun and enjoyable, nothing less nothing more.

Sound : 
The music may be forgettable, but overall it's fine. The voice acting leaves something to be desired though.

Graphics / Performance : 
The game looks pretty good, but the performance is very spotty. Wait for a few updates if you're running a slightly older PC (anything less than a 1080 and a Ryzen 5).
If you have a top notch build, go for it I guess, just expect some frame drops here and there.

Overall
This game truly is a 7.5/10 in every single way. It does nothing wrong but falls short of being great.

I was afraid the new Kamala girl was going to be the center piece of the game, while she is and the story revolves around her, you get to play the other characters just as much. Alot of people are hating on this game not because it's bad but because they don't know what kind of game they are getting into.

Pros: 
Beautiful
Fun
Good combat system
Leveling system is way better than the beta
Loot system isn't as annoying as destiny (although they have similarities)
environments are immersive
No annoying HUD - very minimal
Decent Story so far
Expanding Roster
Multiplayer

Cons
Changing characters is non existent in free roam, have to level up in game
Iron Man isn't that fun to play in my opinion.
Minor Bugs

33,75521981,english,"(This review will be MOSTLY spoiler free) I decided to get this game because I thought it would be fun, and it is. Besides the various bugs that ruin the game. Now before anybody says that ""all games launch with bugs,"" I will say, yes, all games do, and they get fixed. But the sheer amount of bugs in this game at launch is disgusting and is, quite honestly, unacceptable. Before getting too much into the bad, let me start with the good.

The story, while nothing tremendous and groundbreaking, is pretty good, albeit short. It has its moments of being very enjoyable, and the villains included (more about that later) are enjoyable to an extent. I think using M.O.D.O.K (and A.I.M by extent) as the main villain is pretty cool, as he has not really been seen in most modern Marvel media. The gameplay (which has been bugged for some, me not as much) is fun, certain abilities, mostly flight for Thor and Iron Man, take some getting used to. Otherwise gameplay is fun. The graphics are great... most of the time.

Unfortunately, the graphics and visuals for this game, while visually impressive, fall off in most cutscenes. At the beginning of the game Ms. Marvel looked fine, then as I kept playing and got to the cutscenes with her and Bruce, for some reason it bugged out and Ms. Marvel's head was completely black. No idea why that happened, but it did. I reset the game and that fixed it, but I should NOT have to do that. Later on I had another cutscene bug with a character where his entire face just messed itself up, one eye was squinting, the other NOT IN ITS SOCKET, and he had a biting lip, not what the character should look like. The problem existed in one of the pre-order skins I was using, and seemed to only exist with that skin. There were also many times where cutscenes would freeze or lag really bad. And this is not a problem with my PC. I am using a Razer Blade that can run games with great graphics and visuals. This problem exists with the game itself.

Moving on from graphics, the complaints I have with the story are: its too short (took me ~15 hours to complete the campaign), Taskmaster and Abomination (the only two other villains besides M.O.D.O.K and [spoiler] Scientist Supreme [/spoiler]) were used only as boss fights, and there could have been more villains in general. The Spider-Man PS4 game is as good as it is because of its intriguing story and usage of villains (there are MANY Spider-Man villains in that game, all used very well), and unfortunately this game does not capture that same feeling, while trying to do so. It feels more like a failed attempt at being something it's not.

Onto gameplay, its nothing groundbreaking, but it is fun to go around and smash people as the Hulk or pummel people with Mjolnir. However, there are some cons. First off, there are times, mostly at the end, where enemies will just gang up on you and not give you a chance. While a seemingly fun concept having to fight off a horde of enemies is, it's not fun when all of the enemies are usually as competent as you are and the ai just wants to gang up and not give you a chance to either recover or take a few enemies out. Secondly,  ctrl + w over aegis enemies does not work, making it difficult to deal with those enemies. That is a problem near the end when you have to deal with that enemy type, as well as a stronger enemy that is pretty unrelenting. Now I figure I will cover the one major bug I have been having, which is where I have had TWO cosmetic appearances get relocked, and I CANNOT unlock them again, as they are story cosmetics. This is unacceptable, and there have been accounts of people losing their PRE-ORDER BONUS SKINS. UNACCEPTABLE. It doesn't help that there are cosmetic appearances you can get using REAL MONEY, and those skins have a chance of disappearing as well. Just unacceptable. 

When I purchase a game, I expect a mostly finished game, with bugs that are pretty minor, nothing too game breaking, but this game has been bad about that. There are more qualms I have with this game, however they delve into spoiler territory, and I would rather not go there as of yet. In a few weeks I will be sure to update my review with post game and spoiler content as I hope Square Enix will fix the game and I don't want to risk losing anything else. As of right now, I CANNOT recommend it to anybody who wants to put $60+ into this game expecting a finished product as it is by no means a finished product. 

(Do note I have not seen any console gameplay for this game, so I might very well be wrong on this next part.) I suspect that this game was made for consoles, then ported to pc, but not ported very well. The pc requirements for this game seem too low, and even my laptop which exceeds the requirements has graphical issues as mentioned before. It would make a lot of sense for this game to have been made for consoles first, then the devs realized they had to release a pc version, so they quickly and not carefully ported this game to pc and did not do any finishing touches.

I don't know what the hell happened but the funny thing is that 4 of those skins that disappeared were the ones that I unlocked in the campaign of the game... and conveniently there is no way of replaying the story missions so I guess they are permanently gone and I guess that's kinda scummy because it seems like you can buy a skin for real money and it's just gonna disappear so... that's hilarious. Btw the facts that there is a deluxe edition of this game that gives you a 72 hour early access and that some versions of this game specifically the PS4 version is more valuable because it's gonna have more content ( I'm talking about spider-man) despite that they all cost the same amount of money and the massive amount of things and cosmetics you can buy for real money in already 60 dollar game, are all disgusting. Once you finish the main story there's only like what... 20 missions with extremly bad level design and like 15 of them take you around 3 minutes to complete so I guess the developers expect me to replay those over and over again to grind my gear that is completely useless 'cause you can't even see it  since in order to change your character's appearance the devs want you to buy skins which are eventually going to disappear from your inventory. If I made it sound like it bothers me that I had 9 skins for Iron Man and now I only have 4 that look like shit I just want to say that that's not true at all actually because I have no fuckin desire to play this game ever again.

59,75455057,english,"Hear me out... this game has some issues. It is not a perfect game. But this game is fun as hell! I can't stop playing it.

I started out playing the single player all the way through before diving into any of the multiplayer aspects. That's what I really wanted this game for anyway. I wanted a fun Avengers single player experience, and you get that with this game. Albeit a little shorter than I would have preferred (I spent about 15 hours as I was unknowingly playing some of the side missions. 10 hours seems to be a better representation of playing the campaign straight through) it has a strong story that connects you to these characters in a very different way than the MCU has. In short the gameplay is again, fun, and absolutely what you make of it. Each Avenger has three different skill trees for you to make them play how you want to play. If you want a crazy button-mashy experience you can do that. If you want a complex system where combos are king, you can make that happen. From a gameplay perspective I think there's something there for any fan of third-person action games.

In addition to an energetic and story-driven single player adventure this game also has a really deep multiplayer system. However, this multiplayer is not for everyone. If you don't enjoy games like the PVE aspects of Destiny or The Division then you will probably not enjoy this multiplayer. That's what this multiplayer is. It is a loot-based game with a long grind. The levels you play are the same ones from the campaign with maybe a dozen more added in. For me, I've found the gameplay more than fun enough to keep returning to these levels to grind for higher loot. AND if you can get a few friends together to run that grind with you the experience is even better. I really love this game and plan to continue the grind for quite some time.

Note: As I mentioned at the top this game is not perfect. I did experience several bugs and one hard crash during my playthrough. However, the fun factor for me far outweighed the occasional bug I experienced. If encountering the occasional bug or frame rate drop completely impedes your enjoyment of a game this game may not be for you, at least right now at launch.

Pros:
- Combat can feel pretty good after you are geared enough
- Though the story is short, it's definitely pretty solid
- Decent looking cosmetic skins for each character
- Simple skill tree system
- Voice actors definitely fit the characters

Cons:
- The amount of bugs still in this game is just really disheartening
-- Characters bug out during cutscenes and out of cutscenes when you try to initiate conversations with them
-- Cosmetics that you unlock have a chance to lock back up... EVEN STORY COSMETIC UNLOCKS will lock up again
- Dodging in combat with a keyboard is wonky and doesn't always respond
- Graphics are hit or miss, especially looking out the windows of the helicarrier... low poly EVERYTHING even on the DECK of the helicarrier!

79,75518267,english,"Game is really good. Combat is what does it, every Avenger's has its own playstyle. So it does feel unique. And since there's 4 player coop, it's even better with friends. I don't get people saying negative about the combat, yes it can be a little unforgiving, in that you can be stun-locked into death -if you're not careful! So anyone complaining there; l2p.

Combat is good, there's this brawler combo-style combat, like dodge, then light attack to counterattack, and there's defensive mechanics. What they could improve on is the amount of skills, currently there's just 3 abilities per hero, that you can augment through the skill-system. And then after level 15 there's even more specialization. In which you choose 1 out of 3 augments to a skill or ability.

Story is alright, it does introduce you to the characters one-by-one, and force you into playing as one specific character for the story. Once you unlock the wartable, there's some missions, side missions, that you can pick whichevery hero you want. Else there's a choice between 2-3.

If you think this game is ""easy"", then you should play on ""Brutal"" difficulty for the story. And Challenge V for the multiplayer/side missions. I've yet to see anyone BREEZE through on those difficulties on Twitch or YouTube. If you have, please link me to where you have seen, or if you have recorded such gameplay. I'm interested to see if there's any hold to the arguments that this game is easy.

What this game get's minus for, from me, is the exclusivity stuff, consoles are prioritized clearly. Some movement things, like it doesn't move according to camera, but according to the character, which is a console issue thing when porting this to PC. And PC version doesn't have a chat, and default it's OPEN mike. But the MTX with costumes and battle pass are all fine. You get all characters and content that's coming with this title. So it's the store who will hold this up only with cosmetics. They get a huge plus for that.

Some missions seems to have the art and assets reused. But this is a solid title for what game is perfect on launch these days? It'll be better over time, right? Let's hope!",1599360230,1599360230,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,76561197985401520,782,46,11868,1284,2446,1601858575

97,75516894,english,"The story so far is great. There are only two complaints I have.  

First, they didn't do a good job balancing difficulty.  Even on easy, you'll end up in missions where the difficulty rating is supposedly lowered, but they throw so many tough enemies on you that you'll end up having to repeat the mission over and over again, or simply give up and try to grind up some better gear and skills and come back.  It really breaks your enjoyment of the game if you are a casual player or someone mainly interested in the storyline for the first playthrough.

The second complaint is that they really need a FOV setting.  The camera is a bit too close to the character and it makes some fights more difficult.  Even worse, the cramped view, dark settings in some missions, and fast-paced action can trigger serious motion sickness for those who have issues with that while playing certain games.

The combat is fun though it feels a tad stiff and certain mechanics don't seem to work as they're supposed; for instance, enemies with Shields. You're supposed to dodge over them to deactivate the shield, but... sometimes you just get blocked? And I really don't understand if that's intended or not, since the tutorial TELLS you this is how every hero can get past shields, but more often than not you just... can't. Dodging invincibility also seems to be a bit wonky; sometimes it works correctly, other times you get hit in the middle of the animation during the invincibility frames section. Flying feels very janky; I have somewhat gotten used to it but it just doesn't feel very intuitive to me; probably a good thing I don't really care about the flying characters anyway. It's hard to describe the flying mechanics; they likely just take getting used to and I haven't gotten to the point of ""used to"" yet. 

I really like the campaign story, so I'll leave it at that; the voice acting is also quite good and fits many of the characters quite well. Some of the character designs look a tad odd to me, but that's likely just me. 

Spider-Man being PS4 only is quite lame. Really hope this is a case of ""Oh, he's 'exclusive'"" but then ends up getting released on other platforms anyway. 

Speaking of characters, all future areas and heroes will be free DLC, with only cosmetics being paid to obtain, although you can still receive them in-game without spending a penny by doing various character challenges which get you some premium currency.

I would not say this game is worth $60, at least not right now; perhaps about $25-$30. The game was made with online co-op as the main draw, but I have not yet gotten around to that so will not comment on any aspect of online play; this is all based purely upon the campaign, which is single player only.",1599356274,1599356274,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197995238408,741,61,1009,0,599,1600458199

46,75513755,english,"I write this review on day 2 of the games full release with 13 hours played. I have finished the main story and am now grinding my main up the levels. I want to say right away I enjoy this game thoroughly. As a huge Marvel fan no game that I have played nails the super hero feeling like this. Thor, Black Widow, Iron Man. and Captain America feel particularly good.

The story was good, very enjoyable especially for someone hungry for new Marvel content. I feel like they nailed the characters personalities and each scene was enjoyable to sit back and watch. The twists of the story were cool and some of the action scenes made me say ""Wow!"" out loud. Particularly the intro battle and final fight. 

I currently have little experience with the endgame content but from what I gather it is like Destiny in its formatting. I am interested in it and seeing how long it keeps me entertained.

Now would I recommend the game for $60? Only for big Marvel fans or if you know friends will be getting the game with you that you can play with. From what I have heard (but have not experienced) the multiplayer is a blast and makes the already fun combat a ton of fun as you tear through enemies with 3 other hero friends. 

Major negatives so far include a myriad of launch day issues. Texture popping, stuttering, poor optimization, crashes (2 in my play through), freezing. and overall glitches were frequent. That being said none of these are unfixable and with time I am sure the dev's will give the TLC the game needs to be smooth. Also, there are some camera issues when there is a lot going on that can cause you to lose what you are looking at or not be able to see your character. Finally, the loot system is unnecessarily deep and messy. I personally think its unfortunate that the items you equip don't alter your characters look. That was something I frequently wished for and feel was a missed opportunity for customization.

The graphics look good most of the time but won't blow your mind and occasionally looks rough in cutscenes (also a part of the launch day issues).

Overall I really enjoyed this game. The combat is fantastic and the story is solid. Unlocking character skills and mastering the combat is rewarding, the ""shallow"" aspects of the game are done well. Where the game lacks is in deeper aspects, it almost lacks character in some ways that say the Batman and Spiderman games don't. 

If you love Marvel, love loot grind games, or have friends to want to smash bad guys with this game is worth the price tag.

56,75513105,english,"This game has its pros and cons, I don't want to go through it all because I'm lazy. 
If you like the MCU, don't expect what you see from there.
If you like Marvel, chances are you'll probably enjoy it.

The overall storyline: (Where I have around 10 hrs of gameplay so far) It's actually pretty fun. Going through re-assembling the Avengers and unlocking new skills is a cool aspect. It can get a bit tedious, but it does feel rewarding. I can assume the game would be better with friends by a long shot, but none of my friends own the game as of now. 

The looting system: It’s not needed at all, personally I don't like it, but it’s not that much extra work to run over and open that crate. As well as how the gear items itself works, it can be confusing. I would spend a bit equipping what seems to be the best for the current mission, but clicking the ""Equip best gear"" button works faster and better nonetheless 

Characters: All the characters have a uniquely different playstyle that can freshen up the gameplay. As long as you don't button mash and use combos, it enjoyable. That's if you don't have more than 5 enemies on you at once, but using the counter button staggers the enemies in a small radius giving you time to breathe, or get shot by 6 more flying drones.

Optimization: A big one. Many people are having a problem with the overall optimization of the game, saying it runs poorly, and to an extent, they aren't wrong. As I am running on a 1070Ti, Ryzen 7 3700x, and 16gb RAM, with my medium/custom settings I can run a solid 80fps. I am also a 144hz player so it is a bit slower, but it’s playable for me. For some people its not.

There is much more to this game, such as current bugs(which I have yet to experience anything game-breaking) to in-game content, microtransactions(which are cosmetic only), and so on. I give a good review because I am a marvel fan, and enjoy these types of grindy, dodge based games.

- Buggy at release.
- Poor performance on some systems(much better than Beta tbf).
- Some MTX items are expensive.

Pro's
- Excellent Campaign.
- Immensely enjoyable Combat(off-screen lasers not withstanding).
- Reasonably varied multiplayer gameplay.
- Well fleshed out Skill sets.
- Each Hero has their Iconic moves from MCU/Comics.
- Plenty of cosmetics that can be obtained for free, regardless of what people would have you believe.

Summary:

Avengers is a game of two halves. The Campaign is well written and has you feeling sympathy to one of the protagonists for the majority of it. Some Missions are extremely well put together Set-Piece events, Tonys Mansion, Widows rescue and the final epic Mission to save the world. Kamala, Ms Marvel, drives the story quite well, from the moment she steps out onto the Helicarrier and fan-girls her way past everyone, all the way to her becoming an Inhuman icon in the Avengers. The Voice acting is very good across the board with MODOK being a prime example. More of it could of promoted Co-op play but it is understandable that they wanted to control the narrative to a fine degree.

Multiplayer is a different beast. It takes on the form of most GaaS Shooter/Looter such as Destiny 1 & 2, The Division 1 & 2 and in some ways Diablo 3. This mix of other Live Service games has some major bonuses and some significant negatives. One positive is that they have taken a more Diablo'esque approach and ensured that all of the Heros play in a significantly different fashion and compliment each other to ensure smoother teamplay. They have taken parts of Destiny when it comes to Vendors having a stock list that rotates over time to ensure that everyone has a fair chance to buy cosmetics. Finally, like in The Division series, there are distinct storylines present in some of the multiplayer content that is both there to introduce you to content as it unlocks such as Hives but also unique Hero specific storylines to help further their individual narratives and to hint at what the future could hold.


If you read this far, well done.

Would i recommend this game to you? Maybe. If you like games such as Destiny/Division/Diablo then yes. If you like Marvel, yes. If neither of those apply then it would be a no...   ...unless you can get it reasonably cheap just to play the Campaign, which imho is worth atleast £25 by itself.

This games combat is awful, the boss battles are boring and the story is so generic that it put me to sleep in minutes.

4,75509966,english,"The campaign is brilliantly executed, i had full immersion throughout the play through. It took around 13 or 14 hours to complete the main story missions, so it was a littler shorter than i would have liked it to be. 

The multiplayer is fine, i enjoy playing it with my friends but the gameplay loop needs a little work. The level design is very basic and many of the missions are pretty forgettable. 

There are an oppressive amount of ranged attacks that stagger and destroy you, the homing missiles are cheaters, the airborn agility they possess far exceeds iron man. I should not be force to dodge a missile more than twice, so when there is several coming at me all at once, all i find myself doing is dodging and hoping for the best. Kindof silly.

Despite the relentless dodging and staggering that this advanced robotic military causes me to do and take, each of the heroes feel unique and powerful in their own right. You do actually feel the impact of the hits that you dish out in-between dodging everything. 

It is obvious that they were more focused on creating heroes that feel good to play than they were on the level design.

As for the monetization system. I personally do not care about any of it. I can't play the game to earn the currency required to unlock future heroes, great, that is all i need. The prices they are asking for some of the items in the store are pretty high, but comparable to what i have seen in other games, some free to play, and some AAA titles. What i did appreciate the most about the game and its marketplace, is how it never forced it on me. They have yet to give me a pop up with a ""discount on credits"" or even an item that if i clicked, would take me to the marketplace. If one wants to purchase something, they can, but the game provides enough for me to work towards getting in game.

6,75509917,english,"Graphics are poorly optimized, to the point that I have to run at the lowest settings to get 60 fps despite running well above the recommended hardware (brand new 2060 and i7).

The story is predictable and boring, while trying to be mysterious and exciting through misdirection and intentionally vague or opaque story telling. There are certain things in the story that most or all of the characters should know, but which are dangled like a carrot for the player to try to figure out. This isn't Dark Souls, being coy with basic facts about the world doesn't work here.

The game play falls to one of the biggest sins of gaming: unreliable controls. Between the frame rate drops and input lag, abilities that need to go off within a split second don't trigger until after the opportunity is gone. This makes for frustrating fights, as well as difficulty in the parkour parts of the game. Missing a ledge that was clearly within reach because the game doesn't want to respond for a moment? No thank you. 

I managed to get to the first boss fight on Brutal, but then dropped the difficulty to Hard after that. I quickly gave up on the gameplay after that and dropped the difficulty to Easy just to see the story. I've beaten enough hard games over the years that I don't need to waste my time trying to beat one that is only ""hard"" because the controls and graphics are bad. It doesn't help that higher difficulty in this game mostly means increasing enemy hitpoints and reducing the time and opportunity to parry (which requires a better framerate and less input lag to work).

The story starts out very ""Disney,"" but thats ok I can go with it. Then it starts going too far into deus-ex-machina territory, where things happen just so they can add ""suspense"" and ""mystery."" No thank you. I don't need a damsel-in-distress mission for its own sake. Write a story that builds on itself, don't get lazy and throw in random stuff just to create unearned climaxes and plot-twists. You have to earn those through the story writing. The story plays out like they decided on where they wanted their climaxes, twists, and reveals first and then tried to slap a stock feel-good coming-of-age tale on top. That said, I do like Kamala.

Lets talk about +

+Story is great... i cant say anything about it+ there will be a lot more (cool.. they say for free)

+Max Lvl 50 (feel good u get it pretty fast) 

+6 heroes for now rly special play style... no one is same lots of combination in skill tree.. i like it.

+Evry hero will have his own battlepass 1000currency (10€)  but you get for start 6 heroes for free and now you can grind 1300 currency. so battlepass will pay it self and u get 300 more.

ok thats all about my pros i find in the game.
Now lets talk about Negatives -

-Gear farming and component upgrade

-After max lvl u get legendary skin.. cool.. they are all ugly for me. But well after max lvl you can still get exp... but there is no Reward for getting lvl 50 again and again... no skins,no materials,no gear... just  nothing you see the bar go from start

-For now you cant buy for in game currency premium skins.. didnt see anything from premium store in shop... maybe they will add it. But you cant see any premium skins or emotes in Hero Collection.  so probably it will stay for money..(how much for legandary skin? it 1400currency, You can buy 2200 for-20€ pretty expensive in game for 60€... and they limit it just for real cash or that u grind from battlepass... for me it suck. I want have chance to grind for them... or buy them.. not just one option.

-This game have looots of bugs. you get underground you stuck somewhere... and looots of others.

-after 37h in game i have nothing to do... i finish story,all maps, and now im jsut gearing and grinding materials and lvl other heroes that i hate and dont want play them.(2x lvl 50 for now and one character with gear in the cap )

-You cant switch to other heroes in game even you play with your bots... so sadly if u play Nat,ironman(with iron you can call hulkbuster that is his ultimate skill) you cant open yellow´´secret doors´´ or anything that u need force to destroy

-And forget mention this game run poorly on RTX 2070Super with AMD Ryzen7 2700

They did an amazing job on the full story and i actually liked Kamala Khans story its a great introducing to her character. Cant wait to see what these devs release next for DLC, i can say i will be sinking hours and money into this game no problem. Controls for each hero is wildly different and takes a while to get use to each one and utilising them to your advantage in battle, which makes each one unique.

My only big complaint is the flying for Thor is a bit goofy looking and both Thor and Iron man you have to manually hit space bar in order to melee someone when it should just auto attack when you use your primary, except it just flies into an enemy or a wall.

All and all this game surprised the hell out of me and is soooooo worth it.

69,75505621,english,"Pros:
Has the Marvel licence, so if you have invested any time in the comics, movies, games or TV programmes you have an idea of the characters and world, and they are giving nods and references to all the above, left right and centre. Pretty much every character has moves or powers straight from the movies, in addition to lots of comic derived powers and abilities. Then there are lots of places, people and things that call back to the comic/cinematic universe.
It looks very nice, the art style works well, and at anything above 1440p on medium or up settings it is good.
4k on ultra settings looks really good, but takes a lot of power to run at those settings.  
I had some doubts about the character designs when I saw the trailers, but they have grown on me, and the sheer amount of costumes/skins means you can kit your team out pretty much how you'd like, and many of the alternate looks are excellent. Animation is good, the combat looks and feels good. Each character's combat moves really sell you on the notion of distinct powersets and make them feel different.
The main story (which I guess is the first ""arc"" or set of missions) though not lengthy is well done. The writing is good, the voice acting is generally excellent in the cutscenes, and the story is both engaging and appropriate to the lore and world.
It is fun to play, particularly if you are connected to the characters in any way. 
The combat may seem simplistic at first, but as you level up and open up the 3 different skill trees it becomes apparent there is more depth and build options than the first few hours might suggest. Unless you play on the lowest difficulty settings you do need to play strategically, using dodge and particularly parry to avoid a lot of dying and retrying. Perhaps it is easier in multiplayer, where other human intelligence might perform better than the AI.
Which is not to say the AI is terrible, both your teammates and the enemy perform reasonably well, though the enemies rely more on numbers and you not having spider senses than on any grand strategy I can see.
It is pretty easy to pick up and play through the first few missions, spamming the first few powers of each character, and you get a tutorial for each character in the Harm Room which starts to introduce you to how to play well. But you can feel like a superhero straight away on ""normal"" difficulty, which is nice to have that accessibility there.
It is inevitable to compare it to other games, particularly the best superhero games. I think the Arkham series still has a better melee combat system (and by all accounts the Playstation Spider-man game too), so if all you had to play here was, say, Captain America and Black Widow, I would say it's not as enjoyable as a brawler. But you also have Thor and Hulk and Iron Man and Ms. Marvel, who all play very differently.
So I would compare Marvel Avengers to Marvel Ultimate Alliance, or Marvel Heroes Omega, or DC Universe Online.
And I think it fares pretty well in comparison to all those (all of which I own, and like, and have played a lot).

Cons:
The engine looks lovely, and handles the fx and particularly the destructible environmental stuff really well, but it could perhaps use more optimization (though a 3080 would have the same effect). I'd love to see DLSS implemented, for instance. 
It is prone to a number of errors, one crash with a specific message, and others where you are just dumped back to the desktop without warning. I also had an issue with what may have been a memory leak wherein the longer I played, the slower it got with the framerate dropping alarmingly despite a reasonably powerful system (amd 3700, 48gig of memory, 2080ti, game on an SSD). And this last thing seemed made worse by dying in the harm room repeatedly. Restarting the game would fix it, and thankfully the patch yesterday (or my changing some settings on the PC) seems to have gotten rid of the framerate issue. But the other two crashing problems persist.
Many people will dislike this type of game, which is fair enough. Replaying very similar levels to endlessly upgrade loot is not everyone's cup of tea.
And then there is the monetization, which honestly I have little issue with. The prices we could argue about, but if they add new characters, costumes and missions, I'm willing to buy some stuff along the way. I think you can either buy a full price game, which is released with all the stuff it will ever have, for a fixed price. Or you can have either a free-to-play with monetization, or a buy to play with monetization, and then you get more stuff for hopefully years afterwards. There are games that you pay full price, then they update for free and add new content (No Man's Sky has been excellent for that), but that is not really a sustainable model indefinitely.
In the end, nobody HAS to buy anything except the game itself. Everything else is optional. Think it's all overpriced? Then don't buy anything, and I guess tell everyone how overpriced it is, maybe the Devs will listen and drop prices.
Yes, it's a brazen, commercial cash-grab. Most things you pay for in the world are. They never said it would be my birthday present, loving crafted and gifted for free.

75,75504882,english,"This is one time where the beta did a serious disservice to a good game.  

I played the Beta and wasn't sure about this game. Like a lot of people I though it was too simplistic all around.  Combat, progression, etc. Turns out I was wrong, and I am happy that I was wrong. The beta was just a very small, and poor slice of the game. 

Marvel's Avengers is Destiny 2 as a beat 'em up.  It's somewhere in between Dynasty Warriors and Devil May Cry as far as the combat mechanics go. So if you thought DMC or Bayonetta were too technically complicated, but find Dynasty Warriors to be too brain dead then this is a good fit for you.  If you like DMC or Bayonetta, you may find this too simple.  If you like Dynasty Warriors, you will need to be patient with yourself and the game as you try to get better. It does demand more skill (though not a lot more).

Once you have unlocked Iron Man and get the Helicarrier functional again, the game turns right into Destiny.  The Helicarrier is The Tower.  They have storage lockers instead of vaults.  There is a cosmetic store which rotates skins on a timed basis.  Faction missions take the place of daily and weekly bounties. There is no decoding of engrams, you just go to the gear merchant and buy what they have available.

Every character has nine skill trees.  Three for basic attacks.  Three for your three abilities (just like Destiny), and three passive skill trees. The level cap is much higher than Destiny; it is 50. Every character also has a challenge card, which is a battle pass/season pass where you unlock goodies by performing certain daily and weekly tasks.  (E.G. destroy three elite robots). Or alternately you can pay to avoid the grind. 

Another thing I like is that the characters are distinct.  The Hulk is meant to get into enemies' faces as often as possible, His Intrinsic Ability is a Rage meter. It drains over time; but fills as you attack. So, you are meant to be aggressive to keep the meter full.  The Rage meter's function (the right trigger on the controller) increases his damage, while also healing him for every hit that connects.  When he takes damage, the Rage meter will deplete instead of his health.  Iron Man also has a meter.  His depletes whenever he uses his ranged weapons (repulsor beams, lasers, and missiles). To fill it back up, he has to melee attack enemies. This supports his role as a hit and run type, as he is supposed to be flying around and lighting guys up. He only comes to fisticuffs when he needs to refill the meter (however, if you just want to punch someone with a metal fist, that is completely doable). 

The voice acting is superb, especially between Bruce and Kamala. Troy Baker nails the subtle awkwardness and timidity of Bruce.  Nolan North as Iron Man... is basically Drake from Uncharted. You either like it or you don't (I do, so it's a plus). It makes me wonder though, if they add Deadpool, will he also voice Deadpool like he did before?  Sandra Saad as Kamala is infectious. What can I say? 2020 has been a crap year, and her bubbly enthusiasm has been a breath of fresh air. Though, i can see how some might find it too much or too saccharine. I also like that they decided to go with the overly arrogant and humorous Thor (a' la Thor Ragnarok), rather than his perpetual serious demeanor from his early days. 

The loot doesn't just increase your stats.  It can add special properties to your attacks. For example the Hulk could get a piece of gear that makes the last hit of his standard combo apply Gamma Radiation to an enemy.  Which is a damage over time status.  That's right, the Hulk has DOT. It can also be applied to his projectiles, turning him into a damn wizard from an ARPG. There is gear that applies Pym particles to enemies and shrinks them! That's only what I've discovered in the 7 hours (at the time of this writing) that I have played. I have no idea what late game loot may do. Oh, and just like Destiny, you have a power level, determined by the gear you have equipped. Resources are used to boost the level of your gear, again, just like Destiny. 

On easier difficulties you can get away with button mashing, which is great for people new to beat 'em ups, and for young ones (who will want to play this).  On Normal I have died a few times from getting carried away with button mashing, and not performing my dodges and parries like I should be. This game really does reward learning and getting better. Having said that, I have been in situations where the balance is clearly for a full team of players. As I have only unlocked Hulk, Kamala, and Tony,  there have been missions where I felt overwhelmed.

Your mileage will vary with the skins. If you are a fan of the comics, there will be some in there that will make you smile. If you just enjoy the movies, you probably won't care too much. They have some deep cuts, like Mr. Fixit for the Hulk (sadly, I have not seen a Planet Hulk skin yet ((turns out I missed it)). Maybe in a future update?). They have a skin for Thor which I really like.  It's all black leather and fur, and really makes him look like a viking, or something out of Dark Souls. They have my favorite iteration of the Thor costume from the mid 00's where he had the scale mail sleeves. Now as for the price.  Some of these seem really greedy. 1400 points for a legendary skin.  That is $14 USD for a skin!  I assume they justify it by having the cosmetic store in the helicarrier, which allows you to buy skins with in-game currency.

- Characters are weak in game cant solo 5 enemies.

R: If +5 is above the mission icon means your equipment level is not high enough to solo them, or not get friends to help you unless you don't have them.

- Game Crash because of graphic being too intense or something.

R: Last I checked this is avengers, not minecraft, If you are running lower then 1080 get a new Graphic card.

57,75434717,english,"Diehard Marvel fan. Have over 13 hours in the 3 day early access and had 699 hours in Marvel Heroes (RIP).

""Ran"" the game on a 1080 TI, 32 gigs of RAM, Ryzen 7, on a monitor with a native 120hz refresh rate. 

This game is just broken at every step of the way. The Day 1 patch didn't fix anything - hell, if you browse the Steam Discussions you'll see people who were playing just fine are now experiencing problems.

Let's talk about what works.

Combat is fine. Each Avenger feels unique to their playstyle. Hulk can pick up dudes and use them as melee weapons, Black Widow can give stealth to teammates briefly, Iron Man talks a lot of shit to his enemies, etc. Each Avenger ""feels"" like you think they would. Expect to mash the dodge button a whole lot though. Some characters can parry, some can't. Some enemies kind've encourage cheesy gameplay with how they disrupt your combat flow but hey, its a brawler - it happens.

Story is actually genuinely enjoyable when the cutscenes actually had audio. As of now, September 5th, there's no way to replay the campaign or any of the cutscenes so I'm screwed on that end. Had to go to youtube to watch the cutscenes that bugged out for me.  Environments were pretty varied. You got city streets, deserts, rocky valleys, high tech AIM labs/bases, snowy areas and more that might be spoiling it - each area/tileset feels/looks different.

Loot system is very similar to any other looter game nowadays. You got common, uncommon, rare, epic, then gold/legendary gear. I didn't get to play endgame but I can only assume each hero gets Uniques/Exotics akin to like Marvel Heroes, Diablo 3, Destiny etc. There's also a crafting system. 

Through the campaign I encountered 2 factions where you can pick up bounties Destiny style that are quick things that get completed in the background. Kill 20 Synthoids, collect X amount of Y material that drops off enemies - again very similar to Destiny and just as cumbersome. You gotta travel to the specific ""bounty npc"" to pick these up but they do auto complete so you don't have to backtrack to turn them in. In 13 hours of casual gameplay with no real effort to try to max out the ranks, I got to rank 6 and 7 respectively with both factions but each faction goes up to 20-25 with new vendor options that unlock as you rank up.

Now let's talk about things that didn't work.

Talking memory leaks that destroy the game after playing 1 to 2 hour sessions, cutscenes with no audio or subtitles with no way to rewatch them, characters falling through the floor infinitely, people actually losing access to cosmetics after buying them via mtx. Game crashing to desktop mid cutscene. Game crashing while idling in an open world area.

[b]These were just the bugs I've encountered and seen friends experience first hand. I implore any of you who want to know more about how bad some of the bugs are to visit the Patch Notes for V1.0 Build 12.9 pinned on the General Discussions section of the game. It's pretty wild. [/b]

The game HAS to be connected to Square-Enix servers or that's that - any cosmetics you might have unlocked? Can't use them because you're not connected! Even if you disabled matchmaking and want to play solo - not connected means no cosmetics and handful of data sync issues. 

[b]My gripes with needing to be connected to Square-Enix servers is simple. If you cannot connect for whatever reason you're toast. Your cosmetics, takedowns, nameplates, and some actual account data is just gone if you're not connected. So if Crystal Dynamics loses the Marvel ip and has to take the game offline you're fucked.

Happened to Marvel Heroes - it can easily happen to this game. I highly suggest reading into the fall of Marvel Heroes. Disney literally decided one day out of the blue to just not renew the IP with Gazillion and the entire game went offline.[/b]

Solo play is definitely not advisable - there are certain chests/materials you can only reach if you have a heavy hitter that can destroy doors. Even if you have an AI controlling the Hulk or Thor there's no way to direct them to break whatever obstacle they need to in order to get to said chest/materials. In the exact opposite, there are terminals with locked chests/materials only accessible by Black Widow or Iron Man that you also cannot direct your AI allies to take care of.

These aren't complex actions either - for the doors you need to break its literally ""charge up your strong attack"" and for the terminals its ""hold X button"" over it. Two things that should be relatively easy commands for AI teammates, but this is coming from someone with 0 game coding knowledge so idk.

Hope you like forced Stealth segments in an action brawler game - cuz there's a few of them in the Campaign mode for whatever fucking reason - and you're not playing Black Widow in them, you know, the stealthy agent of the Avengers. Also if you happen to want to jump straight into Multiplayer mode, you get hit with a cutscene that spoils the entire campaign if you haven't cleared it. Cheers.

[b]The game is just poorly optimized for PCs. I'm still following threads on the General Discussion in hopes there is a fix but as it is now, I cannot recommend a purchase. Please, hold onto your money till after they officially announce a fix or a Nvidia driver update specifically for post-launch Avengers. [/b]

It's 2020 where devs have the opportunity for alpha/beta/stress tests well before their ""launch"" days - be it 3 days before the street date or the day of. Yes, it's ""normal"" for games in the modern age but there are games that launch and are actually [b]not broken[/b]. Crazy. I know. 

Edit : Steam gave me the refund despite having 13 hours clocked in. If that's not a sign people are refunding en masse due to current build problems, I don't know what is. Crystal Dynamics had multiple PC betas to get this right but somehow shit the bed at launch.

While the basic controls remain the same, each of the 6 playable characters all feel unique between their play style and abilities. The 3 active abilities can even be modified in a couple ways to compliment your build/play style.

Campaign was a fun introduction on playing each of the characters, but the game's main focus is after the main campaign as you take on and unlock new missions to really grind out your levels and gear.

There will be FREE content added to the game later on; new missions, new characters etc. This completely justifies the microtransactions in my opinion, as they are strictly for cosmetic items such as costumes, emotes, and profile picture banners. This money lets the devs continue to develop more content for the game and keep it alive for longer at no cost to you if you choose not to buy cosmetics.

There are some bugs that occasionally get in the way, but nothing game breaking. I've had enemies stuck in walls (restarting from checkpoint fixes).

Performance is worse than the Horizon ZD launch, and that's saying a lot. I highly recommend holding off on buying this until these issues are confirmed resolved.

Combat in this game can be fun, but as others have been saying, it's often very frustrating trying to deal with AIM combat soldiers piling on top of you while you're also being shot at by endless ranged enemies that are blasting you from afar.

79,75496138,english,"This game is a mess.
I played the open beta, and actually had a lot of fun with it. I'll admit that the game does scratch that MCU itch.

When it works

But this game as of launch just doesn't:
[*]The matchmaking has only ever paired me up with one other person, or nobody at all.
[*]The A.I. is stupid as all hell, making the point above worse if you have to play solo
[*]There are infinite loading screens both in the multiplayer and throughout the campaign
[*]Crashes galore
[*]The framerate for me has been ok, but the game does stutter heavily when loading in assets like texture pop-in, Level of Detail, etc.
[*]There are parts of the map that contain loot that are only available to certain heroes, (Giant doors that need to be smashed, terminals that need to be hacked, etc) but the A.I. will not open them for you if you are playing a hero that can't access them. Again, making solo more frustrating
[*]Sometimes the game will just change the difficulty setting for missions. It's easy to change back, but annoying
[*]In the multiplayer missions that I played, about a third of them needed to be restarted because the enemies that we needed to kill simply wouldn't spawn. 
[*]There was one mission where one of the other players went into a T-pose but was still able to run around the map like normal. Fantastic
[*]Sometimes when giving materials to a vendor to make an item, that item never gets added to your inventory. So you essentially just wasted all those materials. How do you mess this up?
[*]The game is literally just deleting people's skins. Yeah. Even ones that people have bought with real money.

There's a bunch of reddit threads you can scroll through to see more bugs
Even ignoring them though, the design of this game just screams incompetence

[*]You cannot replay the campaign. Why did they think this was a good idea? Supposedly the devs are aware and are going to add a replay ""feature"" but this is absolutely unacceptable
[*]Everything on the marketplace is overpriced. $14 for a skin is absolutely atrocious for a game that is already $60
[*]The level design is just...weird. Nothing looks like it belongs anywhere. You have giant floating platforms in the middle of nowhere, crates with loot just randomly placed around the map, turrets pointing at weird angles, etc
[*]What you actually do on missions is the usual cut-and-paste job of defend this thing from waves of enemies, or stand here and defeat a bunch of enemies. The only notable one that was different was rescuing hostages from prison cells
[*]The game's philosophy is wishy-washy as fuck. The gear you collect and equip on your character doesn't change their appearance at all, (that's all skins) because they probably don't want you to put a bunch of cool looking gear on Iron Man to potentially confuse him with War Machine or something. So they wanna be comic accurate or canon, okay fine. But then you have the Hulk who is just the most watered down version of the Hulk I have ever seen. He run's slow, doesn't jump very high, and gets staggered by every ranged attack in the game. Playing as Hulk doesn't feel like Hulk at all, a lot of people are complaining about this. I understand that it's for gameplay balance purposes, but if Hulk can't be Hulk then why can't my Iron Man be something else too? 

To say some positive things though:
[*]The campaign actually surprised me, and is easily the best part of this game. Which only makes the issue of not being able to replay it more disappointing. 
[*]Iron Man feels really good to play as, and makes me want a Spider-Man PS4-styled Iron Man game.
[*]The game has a lot of easter eggs and nods for Marvel nerds like myself to freak out about
[*]The game looks great...most of the time

I want this game to be good. The concept is there, it just needs a bit of a rework in some areas and some much needed QoA testing

Love/Hate this game at the same time lol

Campaign mode is solo and reminds me of games like Dragon's Lair in which you follow a story and have specific things you MUST do in order to progress. This style has never been a favorite of mine, so I easily miss cues that might  be obvious to others more experienced with this style of what I will term ""Glorified Tutorial"".

I've been told playing it on ""Easy, Normal, Hard, Epic"" really does not affect loot etc that you get while playing in this mode, so you COULD just play through on ""Easy"" just to get the story background as that is skipped in the multi-player mode. For me, gosh darn it.. I don't wanna play easy! I'm stubborn like that.

I know a lot of people will probably come in and say, did you try this, did you change driver XXX + YYY, did you do this or that? Down under the review more is my hardware and more on my system and everything I tried. I waited versus buying the deluxe because of the bad performance people were getting, PRAYING there would be a fix on Friday when it came out for everyone else. The first mission never got above 30fps till after I got to (Spoiler) Ironman + Thor flying to the bridge and than the game performance increased some. Why? This made zero sense. I spent over 2 hours adjusting settings, Nvidia control panel graphic adjustments. I'm now at 30 on Resolution scale + everything on low and I can barely play it. Heck half the time it crashes saying I don't have enough memory which is a load of dog poo. I know i'm ranting but I'm so frustrated and disappointed all the same. It's unplayable at anything higher than a 1080p resolution UNLESS you seem to own a 2080 TI and maybe it seem to run, okay at that. The most frustrating thing is my son who's next to me on an IDENTICAL system is fine at 1080p. It's disgusting that a company who has beta testing, along with even pushing back the release, can't even produce a game that will run on a system above and beyond the recommended requirements. 

Now I will say when you do get to play, the story is great. It's the only reason I keep 'trying' to get through it to play it. This game has caused me massive headaches from being at 80+ fps out doors to 1 fps in a Elevator. This game could have been something incredible but I wouldn't touch this game if I were anyone else unless you meet the 1080p only requirement OR it's 50% off. I'll keep playing it as my son wants to really play with me on co-op but I finally got tired of the 20th+ crash that I had to get this off my chest.

This machine ONLY play's games, it doesn't even do any web browsing or what not as I use my other PC next to it for anything in this area. i've tried different video card drivers, settings in the control panel, graphical adjustments in game from the highest/middle/low/etc, nothing seems to change the actual performance.",1599323194,1599323194,False,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,76561197970289901,248,3,967,3,603,1601670982

35,75491592,english,"Yeesh. Where do I start.

In general, the game can be intense but also great fun. 

I see some spelling mistakes (in subtitles and armour names) and I also see a lot of glitches. Especially when Iron-Man shoots his repulsors, they can sound like a wet slap from time to time; after entering the Hulk Buster (please fix). 

Hoping they expand the characters by giving them new heroic abilities. However, what we have now will suffice.

I like looter shooters so I don't have a problem with the addition of a loot system but what's weird is when you're putting loot on is that it doesn't change the look of the character (hey I know they gotta monetise this game but surely you make it so loot can still change the look of a character). Square Enix you could have paid skins override the look as an option. It feels weird having a looter shooter when the loot that your character has isn't aesthetically reflected during game-play.

Combat can feel iffy - I feel if they add  impacting sounds and add better cinematic cameras for takedowns/cool moves that combat will benefit from this. 

Another thing that pisses me off is that SPIDER-MAN is a fucking PS exclusive, I chose to play on PC because I don't want to play with 30-60 mere frames on a shitty resolution. They better say in a couple months time that he is a timed exclusive otherwise I'm going to be MAD (like Hulk).  

Over half way through the campaign and I recommend it. There a lot of cool moments that made me smile.
Buy this game to support it so they can add more content.

PS. If they give Sony another exclusive I'm boycotting this game.

40,75491091,english,"While I do recommend this game! It has its cons. However i believe these will all be fixed and patched in the future. Avengers is just like Destiny and Warframe, but I have major gripe about how this game differs, and thats AI teammates. I enjoy playing this game alone with AI Teammates but you cannot direct them in anyway, for example only 3 of 6 characters can break barriers using a heavy attack. So if you are playing as the other 3 that cant you will be unable to open that area for loot. Which brings me into the 6 characters it can tough to decide who to play as. Because each one is legit a real grind. Which is why i think the AI SHOULD LEVEL UP TOO! so at least you can unlock skills with them once you want to play with them and its not level one character to 50 and then switch to a level 5 and it be another slow build up. However this is only for leveling and not looting. Looting should always be for the character you are playing as only.
Pros. The story is fun! and it even goes beyond the campaign. Each character feel unique and plays different from each other, which i like. Even though both iron man and thor can fly each flies differently. I am really enjoying this game and every time i stop playing and am just thinking about when i can play again and what i should do that time. 
PC Version: This game crashed on me randomly 4 times now. different stages and missions. It even crashed on the final boss of the campaign and i was about to uninstall if i had to redo all of it, but thankfully the autosave saved me put me roughly right where i was in that fight.

62,75489632,english,"Overall score: 8.5 out of 10

This game is an RPG. That means at level 1 you will not be extremely powerful, which is why a lot of people are saying they don't feel like an Avenger. By level 13-15, your character will be *much* more powerful. My current Hulk (level 14) demolishes five or more enemies at a time, while recovering health and heroics are a furious pace. My Black Widow does absurd amounts of damage to a single target at a time.

For me, the combat is overall great. That being said, when it is working it is amazing, when it is not working it is really bad. However, the issues in combat are fixable, in other words, this isn't a case where the underlying gameplay is bad and needs a total overhaul. It needs some tweaking. Dodge notifications could be better, I think Black Widow's intrinsic power could be improved, chain staggering needs to go away. All fixable. Will the devs fix it? I think so, and of course, I hope so.

The campaign is absolutely fantastic, and nearly worth the price of the game alone. To complete the main campaign and all of the iconic missions takes maybe about 30 hours (I'm estimating based on how far along I am at this time).

Much ado has been made of paid cosmetics. Overall, I think that the battle pass system is fine. You don't need to buy them to get the characters and story only the premium cosmetics. So let me say this again, you do *NOT* need to buy them. At all. Ever. You might buy them for, say a character you really like and are going to play a lot. That seems like a fair trade to me (playtime for money). I do think the marketplace items are overpriced. Personally, I more inclined to buy 50 items at $2-3 apiece than 3 items at $15 apiece, because I'll buy something cheap on a whim. But overall, I think the game is reasonably fair in terms of monetization.

I find all 6 characters to be fun and they all have their own differentiating combat mechanics. Captain America uses his shield a lot and has quite a few staggering effects with it. Thor can pin people with his hammer. And so on.

So, overall, is the game perfect? Ha! No, absolutely not. Is it fun? To me, yes. I like the combat, I like the way the loot works to facilitate a fighting style. I'd like to see a bit more variety in the individual slots, but overall it mainly works. The campaign is excellent. And the issues that do exist with the game are all things that can be fixed without a monumental overhaul to the game.

80,75487465,english,"[b]I SHOULD NOTE THAT THIS REVIEW COVERS THE SINGLEPLAYER ASPECT OF THE GAME:[/b]

I don't know if my game review shows my early access playtime of 7 hours, but man what a 7 hours it was.

I need to make it clear, the game itself has... SOMETHING in there. But man did they drop the ball. Really disappointingly so, because this game has the ingredients to be something good.

The story and voice acting is quite possibly the best part about the game for me, because the gameplay is highly repetitive to the point of being boring. There is absolutely zero variety in the enemies you face other than maybe a different coat of paint, but other than that the enemies you face are largely the same throughout.

The combat itself - while there's a LOT of variety there with different attacks being unlocked and different characters to choose from, it still feels like everyone in the game plays the same way. I had more fun playing as certain characters more than others, but it felt like it made no difference if I approached a mission as Ms. Marvel or the Hulk, despite having two very different intended playstyles.

I did enjoy playing as Iron Man, however. But despite all of its variety that the game presents you with, it still just feels like the combat comes down to pressing the same buttons over and over again while you clunkingly attack until the enemy falls over and dies with no real thought put into it. 

Now, as I mentioned this review focuses on the offline aspect. But if you're a solo guy like me? You probably might want to skip this one. Mainly because a lot of the missions features a 'capture the point' deal as a part of its objective which when all of your companions are AI it makes it incredibly difficult to do.  While I appreciate the effort in them trying to account for someone who might not want to play online it just feels like they didn't even attempt to make the companion AI competent. Being able to command your companions to stay in a specific spot would go a LONG, long way in making things less of a headache that would be much simpler if you went online to play with others.

Much like the combat, the mission structure is also repetitive. As I mentioned earlier there's an abundance of 'capture the point' objectives, but the majority of the game either comes down to that or just beating up the same waves of enemies over and over again until it's time to move on to the next room. Which I'm sure IS more fun with friends, but alone and dealing with AI companions it's just completely dull.

It's a shame because I really wanted to like this game and I DO like some aspects of it. In fact I do recommend grabbing it on sale, or just grab it right now if you're not like me and want to check out the multiplayer. But for singleplayer? I honestly just cannot recommend it at all.

tl;dr:

Story
Voice acting
Iron Man rules

38.5 hrs on record (21.8 hrs at review time)
From the play of the beta alone, I'm so happy I pre-ordered and bought this game. Not only did I make some new friends from the weekend experience, but I constantly found myself wanting to search every nook and cranny of the maps, I found myself countless of times wanting to grind for loot and resources to upgrade it. More than not, I found subtle but noticeable differences with almost every mission I ran back to back and enjoyed doing it. It is highly addictive for a PvE game. and when you have a group of people who communicate, and work together it gets even better. Even with a friend constantly putting it on the hardest difficulty to where we were fighting enemies that were double our levels and power levels. Boy was that a challenge.

Yes, there were some issues in the betas, but it's a beta I will touch base on the issues I met in the beta WHEN the game fully launches, and its FULL optimization is implemented.

I can NOT give the game an overall rating just yet because it's not fully out yet, but if it were, I’d give it 7.5 easy and that’s even with the few crashes and optimization issues I met in the beta.


In all, would I suggest this game to people? YES
Would I strongly suggest it for players who wanted a FUN game without PVP? Hell yes
Is it worth the money at this point? YES
Would I suggest this game for the story and Co-Op content? I couldn’t say yes enough

Now its Launched, the full game is  out and Almost all of the Beta bugs are GONE and even though matchmaking needs some  improvement still i cant get enough of it. i stand  by my  previous  Review from the beta and can not Suggest this game enough. im  at 40 hours and climbing at the time of this review... and i cant get enough

90,75485727,english,"This game is completely soulless. I'm sure it doesn't need explaining that microtransactions are poisonous and exploitative, and the way they've been announced to be implemented into this game with future hero releases is particularly disgusting, but it really is funny -- in an oh-god-capitalism-is-ruining-video-games-as-a-creative-medium kind of way -- that any errant click on the character card screen opens a page to purchase premium currency.

Any superhero power fantasy the game might have had is immediately ruined in the prologue when you notice Captain America hitting as hard as the Hulk does, and he's better at it because he can use his ranged attack faster.  The game's attempt to include every Avenger -- the ones MCU fans will know, at least -- and, for some reason, loot, leaves little space for mechanical individuality in the cast as they struggle to justify everyone's skill trees and abilities;  heal or do extra damage every two or three minutes! Click frantically at robots and goons that look like robots until they fall over and hope you don't get hit, because, if you get hit, who knows when the stagger-chain will let you play again! 

And the loot! Why? My favourite part from the comics was watching the Hulk deliberate over which spine (all of the Hulk's gear is gross) was warm enough to take into the arctic. It seems a characters specific abilities and specialities should determine which one you pick for each mission, but, because they want you to play and grind and spend money on microtransactions to take the pain away, they've slapped this mobile-game gear and upgrade material system on to a game that -shouldn't- need it. The only thing that halfway justifies the gear system is each character's stats, though the choice's are shallow; of course the Hulk wants to hit things harder, obviously Iron Man wants to shoot things better.

The visual character designs are immensely bland, like MCU leftovers, halfway between realism and the kind of overly intricate design only Japan is good at. At least they let Kamala be bright and comicbooky -- everyone else could have done with a second look or thirteen. Black Widow, Thor and Ms Marvel get away with the least amount of damage. However... Tony Stark looks like Jason Lee but whiter, and the only Iron Man suit with personality is the one with the pilots helmet. The Hulk looks fine -- it's hard to mess him up -- but Bruce Banner is... hot? And fit? And looks nothing like a man tortured by his alter ego, you know, the thing that makes him interesting as a character. By far the worst offender is riot cop Captain America -- it should be obvious why that's so tasteless.

I'll finish the campaign because its nice to see MODOK get some mainstream attention and, apart from the obnoxious heroes-mess-up-once-now-everyone-hates-them trope, it's alright so far, but that's where I'll drop it. It's not worth the money you spend on the base game, and it certainly won't be worth the money you spend on future characters.

starting out with the gameplay tho,first time i saw the gameplay it didn't interest me but as i got my hands on it it really grew on me each character plays how you think they would play and with their own unique set of abilities and passives like tony's passives he can hover,fly and has 3 different projectiles and each character also has 3 set of unique abilities each one set to a class like support,assault and heroic like for example iron man's support is that he has an infinite supply of ammo until the ability runs out then he has to wait for it to recharge while assault is more focused on dishing out big chunks of damage like iron man's assault ability which is a beam that shreds anyone,and heroic is basically the ultimate of each hero with iron man taking out the motherfuckin hulkbuster as his ability and combining these with combos of your basic and heavy attacks can make out for a pretty fun combat with variety with each hero so not half but it's nothing speical,it's good at what it wants to do but what it wants to do is nothing new or special also boss fights are pretty cool

the story started out really fun and mature with light spoilers captain america dying in the first mission and setting the world for this broken aesthetic which was nice but as it goes on the story starts to go into a really comic book direction especially around the end and it's a shame cause for the first half it was pretty fun

Yes, It's a live service game & it's a bit repetitive but, The game play is good enough for me to want to come back & play more.

One big issue that is plaguing my experience as of now (09/05/2020) is the optimization, It really needs work. I started to get constant stutters & frame drops towards the end of the main story which was annoying. Honestly though, I didn't crash one time playing through the main story missions which is a plus!

Now, this game is getting a lot of hate & it deserves it in SOME ways but, NOT others. The story was really exciting & fun to play through & the missions were fun but, kind of felt the same at times. The combat will keep me coming back to play though! It just never gets old beating people up with Captain America's shield or soaring through the air as Iron Man!

Is it worth the full price though? I think YES! It has plenty of content to keep you busy & like I said before the combat is just great! It works well with a mouse & keyboard & I also played the game on my 21:9 monitor & it worked great! So, If you have an Ultra-Wide monitor you're in luck!

38,75479799,english,"Overall a pretty good game, despite what I thought it would be. During the beta, you had a few missions and a few mini-bosses and I had my fair share with that, but then in the actual game, you get so much more. I constantly sat on the edge of my seat as every mission escalated from the last. It's hard to put in examples without spoiling anything, but all I can do is quote the infamous IGN line: It makes you feel like those superheroes.

Kicking enemy ass either with Cap's shield, Thor's Hammer, Iron Man's thrusters and so on is such a rewarding feeling and I can't get enough of it. I completed the campaign yesterday and I can see myself playing this for a LONG time to come.

PROS:
- The story is pretty good and I felt like I was watching an Avengers movie, but also acting in the fight scenes
- The combat is fluid and you can set up your own combos pretty easily
- The controls are easy to understand and responsive to execute
- There are a lot of skins for you to customize and if you don't like the charatcers' appearence, most skins cover them
- It grants you a good sense of progress
- The campaign gives a lot of ""This-shit-is-going-to-hell-wtf-do-I-do""-feeling with everything exploding and on fire, so you feel like you have an important role in this
- The characters are pin-point accurate and I love doing missions while listening to either an awkward Bruce Banner, a sarcastic Black Widow, a narcissist Thor or a witty Tony. Tony by far has the best dialogue in the entire game and I loved it.

CONS:
- Can be a bit repetitive
- Not many maps outside campaign
- After the campaign, it goes kinda downhill, where nothing is as exciting as the campaign missions, but I haven't done many warzones or raids yet, so I hope they bring it back up a notch
- Kamala is written in a mediocre way at best, which wouldn't bother me if she wasn't the protagonist and the whole story revolves around her
- There were a few bugs, from dead enemy models stuck in the air, Thor glitching when he flies and Cap when he throws the shield mid-air, he starts gliding until he hits the ground for some reason
- Not sure if a looter shooter, or a looter ""brawler"" if you will, was the best choice for an Avengers game
- The different items you loot don't show up on your character, which I guess is for the skins to make sense. Wouldn't make much sense to have gauntlets and belts be individual from the skins, but still a bit weird approach

All-in-all, it's a very good game in my opinion. It gives me a good sense of ""Holy shit, did you see that?? I was amazing!"" feeling and that has been something I have longed for in a game for years. I have played this since the 1st of September due to my deluxe edition and I will keep on doing so, seeing this is a game I can put up with my favorites.

Does the combat require skill to master? Yes. But that to me is a plus.

Learn the combos for the heroes, execute them correctly, know when to use the charge up abilities and when to dodge or go airborne. If you take the time to learn and get better than the combat is great. Not all of the heroes/heroines play the same or are created equal.

62,75476796,english,"Gameplay is fun, fluid, and has some decent weight to it (I say some, there are instances where it doesn't, example while you do feel like the Hulk whenever smashing people's faces in, the fact that small units can stun him with certain moves can take you out of the experience abit). Campaign is actually pretty great, Kamala Khan as the main protagonist I originally thought was gonna be awful. Wasn't a fan of her comics (her comic origins are too teenage angst. Combine that with them being tainted with SJW bs, it just wasnt my taste) but she's done more justice here. While she still has that teenage fangirl-ish quality, they do make her an interesting and sympathetic character. 

Also I like that you can have AI team mates with you on missions. Im not a multiplayer guy and I hate games that promote co-op but essentially leave single players on their own with no ai support to help them. This game at least allows you to take AI bots with you, pick the heroes you want (unless its campaign mission specific), and have a blast. I feel like Im actually assembling an Avengers team which is awesome. It helps the AI is at least somewhat competent too (I mean Ive played games with way worse friendly AI than this)

However two big things weigh this game down
#1. Microtransactions and Battle Passes. Ima say this right now f#$k Square Enix for pulling this garbage. Maybe Im just old fashioned but I believe in the mantra ""If you pay $60 for a product, that product shouldnt nickel and dime you like a free to play game would."" Expansion packs are totally fine, Im all for that. But when I put down $60 of my hard earned $$$ on a game only for it to throw ads and the marketplace in my face screaming BUY THIS COSMETIC CRAP TOO! (for like $8-15 a piece), yea no I have a middle finger right here for ya Square. Thankfully I dont care too much about cosmetics so I know I will hardly ever use that damn marketplace. But I know others do value cosmetic stuff and to the fanboys who say ""You dont have to buy anything, the devs said its optional""-jackweed if they reaaally didnt want us to look at it, they wouldn't put the Marketplace front and center whenever youre in the menu, customizing your character, putting up daily quests to get you rewards you can use in the shop, etc. They CLEARLY want you to use that store and they'll use every incentive and subtle temptation they can to get you using it. Stop defending bad business practices. Also charging for a battle pass for EACH AND EVERY INDIVIDUAL HERO?! This is dangerously close to Battlefront 2 (2017) levels of greedy. 
#2. Optimization. This game has god awful optimization for the PC. Even on Medium settings, my framerate varies wildly almost every second from 60fps to 30 to 45, etc.  This shit needs patching. If I can run Total War Warhammer II, Battlefront 2, Borderlands 3, Hitman 2, Rise of the Tomb Raider, and Doom Eternal on Ultra for 60FPS, I should at least be able to run this on high 60FPS. 

TLDR
My recommendation: It is a Thumb Up but with several asterisks***.Campaign is great, Graphics are great, Gameplay while abit simplistic is fun especially when you go into a fight with 3 other Avengers AI or with Friends. HOWEVER-First asterisk is If you love cosmetic stuff for your characters and try to stay away from games  that incentivize that concept so hard, stay far away from this game. It will prey on your love for cosmetics to get you spending ludicrous amounts of $$$. If you can ignore that, you have nothing to worry about. Second asterisk is if your rig is not as good as a GTX 1070 8GB like mine is, also stay away until optimizations come in. If Im having problems running this damn thing, your experience will likely be far worse with a lower spec rig. Third asterisk-This game can be grindy as hell but I dont mind that. Others might however, take that how you will. Overall, I give it a 7.5/10. Will give it an 8.5 as soon as it is optimized.",1599300837,1599301132,True,0,0,0.497737526893615723,0,True,False,False,76561198008991306,613,12,685,22,78,1601671288

79,75475351,english,"So far so great. I am only a decent ways into the single player campaign and haven't even touched multiplayer so I will have to update this later.
But this has been an amazing game so far.

To go into greater detail:

--Story -- 
Not that far in but this has surprised me. Was half expecting a multiplayer game with a few cutscenes here and there but this feels like a solid single player game. The story so far is great with excellent voice work and.... well you know how so many game just toss you in mid fight....to get straight to the action. This game has a fairly long slow opening followed by the frantic action. I find that it is the little quiet moments that I appreciate and am glad are there. Like sneaking past someones window whiles an aim bot comes in and scans them. Just top notch all around. There is just a lot of attention to detail that you would expect from a major story based game, like walking up to the quinjet in the helicarrier and seeing the technicians instructions written on the side of it, you know ""Use latch to open panel B"", just well done all around.

--Gameplay--
Again not that far in. I have only played as *Minor spoilers maybe* Ms Marvel, Hulk and Iron Man. Starting with the level up system and skills. Just wow. Again surprised. I have wanted something like this for soooo long. MUA never got there. So I am so happy to say that this is a game where the different characters FEEL different. With different movement and abilities both offensive and defensive. They even have different types of power gauges. Iron Man FEELS like Iron Man, with the repulsers sure but also the lasers, missiles, defensive systems, etc.
I mean I finally play a superhero game where I can blast and fly. There are also little things like how...heavy the Hulk feels. Lots of little tricks are used to make you feel like you are playing as the Green Goliath. 

--Multiplayer--
Haven't tied it yet. I am more into single player in games. I am of the Sony style setpiece games crowd :). Still plan on trying the multiplayer tho so.... Watch this space I guess.

--Performance--
This is the catchy part.
For reference. I am running a:
i7 8700K 
32GB 3200Mhz DDR4 Ram
Nvme SSD
MSI 2080TI Gaming X Trio
No Overclock.

This game made me wanna upgrade :| . The 30 series can't come soon enough.
On one hand it is GORGEOUS. I cannot stress that enough.
On the other hand my computer is getting one hell of a workout both CPU and GPU.
Still I am running High settings with Anisotrophic turned up.
I get a locked 4K 60 fps.
But I haven't tried the multiplayer yet. May drop down to 1440p for that.

I HAVE encountered one problem, which may be my computer.
Sometimes my fps will drop when something is loading.
Like I will enter a scene and it will drop to 40+ for a second or two.
But then I die and try the exact same scene with no drop at the same point.
It may be my SSD or ram but for full transparency I will put it here. Will alter this if I get a fix.
-Note- I actually wasn't sure if I should leave this in. See I started playing on the 2nd (I am SO BUSY, it sucks). Where I had this issue. But I haven't had this issue now in 2 days. Will leave it in for clarity but just to note whatever this was seems to be fixed.

86,75474696,english,"Technical:
Yeah there's some bugs and crashes and whatnot but that I can deal with.  These usually get ironed out eventually.

Combat:
The combat is just not fun. Enemies (even the small normal mobs) do way too much damage. Shielded enemies can only have their shield broken by held heavy attacks but the wind up on ALL attacks takes WAY too long. Combine the long windup times with enemies that will mass swarm you with attacks and you can never get moves off because even weak attacks can cancel your moves.  There's also wonky targeting on the heavy moves so even if you do get one off you only have about a 50% chance at best to hit the enemy you wanted to.  It just feels like clunky chaos to the point where I achieved just as much (probably more) by just mashing buttons as I did when I tried to go at it with strategy.

Loot:  
Generic.  I'm probably to early in the game to get the interesting loot but it pretty much just has a number on it that tells you how good it is.  Light Level from Destiny all over again.  The gear says it has stats on it like Valor or Resilience but there's nothing in the game that I've found that tells you what Valor or Resilience actually is or what it does for you.  I'm guessing resilience is a form of defense but what does it actually do?  No clue.  Regardless it really didn't feel like it does much of anything.  I decked out a character in all resilience gear and I still took just as much damage from everything as I did before.  Boosted several pieces of gear with resources and I couldn't tell the difference in the amount of damage I dished out or took.  

Graphics: 
Like the loot it's kind of generic looking.  Not bad but not good.

Sound:
Pretty decent.  It serves the game well but nothing really stands out.

The Rest:
Forced stealth missions? Fuck off.  I never thought I'd see The Hulk as a weak little bitch, but they managed to do it.

89,75474361,english,"[h1]WARNING: MULTIPLAYER AND COSMETIC UNLOCKS ARE LOCKED BEHIND A SQUARE ENIX ACCOUNT. - MULTIPLAYER SAVES CAN BE HACKED WITH CHEAT ENGINE TO MAX CHARACTERS.[/h1]

[b]Review Preface:[/b]
Did you pay for Delux Edition? Did you unlock cosmetics? Do you want to play multiplayer? Well - get ready for fork over your personal information to Square Enix because why should you be able to play a game you paid for without strings attached?

And when you do play multiplayer - did you grind your character to get max level? Why bother? Your save is locally stored and can be hacked with cheatengine. You will be online with plenty of cheaters, which essentially cheapens any effort you may invest in this game.

[b]My experience in the first 60 mins of gameplay:[/b]

Launch game, stuttering menu animations and frame drops in the intro...in 2020.

First level is pointless and ham-fisted and literally serves as a cheap way to have the protagonist get super-powers without any real effort or character development. The only character development we get is that shes strong, female and 'totally the biggest comic fan ever, omfg'. It then quickly segues into the campaign's first combat mission where you rotate through the various Avengers.

At this point, you play a corridor/on-rails style beat-em up getting exposure to the various mechanics for each hero. Thor can bash and throw Mjolnir, fight without it, pin enemies to the ground with Mjolnir, summon it and with all that, he can infuse himself with lightning powers. Then you get a run with Hulk, who smashes some stuff, his signature move is to grab people and use them as weapons...he can throw a rock and other than that, he feels pretty under-powered for the _hulk_. But I guess with progression, at max level he would be a beast? I don't know, I don't care as I refunded the game when I learned you can hack your save game as its stored offline. Then we get to play a little bit with Iron Man who is underwhelming to say the least. Again - I assume with upgrades Iron Man will get more powerful, but as it stands he has his Repulsor Blasts and Unibeam and can fly - slowly.

Next up we meet Cap America, who is probably the most enjoyable to play because the shield mechanic is kinda fun, you can ricochet the shield and get around enemies with riot-shields easily but again, Cap is 1pretty much a one-trick pony at this point in the game.

The finally we meet Black Widow, who has the super ability of being absolutely normal. Top Russian-trained Spy; she can kick, she can punch but most of all, she can provide the least utility on a team composed of a robotic exoskeleton, norse god, gamma radiated monster and a 120 year old Super Soldier. But its okay, she has pistols and stun batons. Which makes me think; if Lowest Common Denominator here can deal with all of the Avengers enemies with human level skills and weapons, then the rest of the Avengers are quite lame considering how much of a struggle the same enemies put up.

Then the combat level culminates in the most underwhelming boss fight. The boss is [spoiler]Taskmaster[/spoiler] who has a shield, fire-sword and jet-pack. It is essentially a boss fight from Dark Souls, except the game feels less like it requires skill to over-come, and more like they've intentionally increased the difficulty in the first leg of the campaign to increase the chances players will hit their 2-hr playtime limit for refunds.

Needless to say, I refunded this hot mess. I'll probably pick it up on G2A when its 5 euro in the Xmas Sales.

I follow this game for a long time because i love super heroes. I play marvel omega a lot but now it's gone so i wanted another marvel games.

I hesitate a lot before buying cause i read A LOT of bad thing and performance issue on this game. But i tried.

And, for me, it runs great. The 1st time i launched it it was atrocious, but i put perfomance in the nvidia panel for this game and now it's smooth as butter. I also let texture on high instead of ultra.

About the memorry leak, i have none. I have msi afterburner running while in game to check everything and i never go above 9.5gb ram.

I play on high setting in 1080 with a r5 2600 rtx 2060 super, 16gb ddr5 3200mhz 1Tb nvme.

Some people really need to check their computer before saying that is the game fault. I have nothing else running than the game, discord and msi afterburner and like i said, it runs really smooth.

So, if you want it but hesitate because of what you read, go for it. If you can manage your computer properly and if you have the same spec as me or above, you're not gonna have any problem.

0,75473198,english,"I have read hundreds of Marvel comics, and just recently caught up to the new Avengers comics (i have read all of the Avengers member comics as well, dating back all the way to 1950's) and when this game was announced way back when, i was ecstatic and also cautious primarily because it is a GaaS (Games as a Service). 

Now, the main big pro's are the settings and the lore/story. The game isn't necessarily a next-gen beauty, but it's graphics and overall visual appearance is nothing short of breathtaking. Finally, our favourite heroes are in current gen 3D. The Lore is also on point, with the codex being chock full of information and readable documents that are also voice acted by an incredible talent. 

Unfortunately, that illusion fades fairly fast. A plague of performance issues, including hard crashes, soft crashes (game freezes, sound repeats and there's no ""error"" seen, it's hidden behind the game crashing), FPS drops, and if you wish to include audio in performance issues, then Audio is missing in many parts of the game, as well as cutting out every now and then. 

If you're planning on getting this game, please wait a bit. Wait and see what the next major update/patch does to fix the underlying problems, because it broke my heart to see a game with such a strong backbone, a strong foundation, slowly crumble before my eyes. 

It's a great game, just, not right now. I do not recommend this game right now, give it time, there is no ""maybe"" option that i can tick for this review.",1599295346,1599295346,False,4,0,0.549549520015716553,0,True,False,False,76561198068588624,396,14,1126,0,1019,1599304879

10,75472183,english,"So, since I barely have the minimum settings acquired for this game, I expected a very bad quality for me, but that isnt the case. The game is quite nice to look at, even at the lowest settings. it looks like a normal AA to AAA title on low and not like say Final Fantasy 7 from 1997. THe Amount of details on lowest settings is wuite impressive, but I think higher settings might be even more impressive.
I am playing on an intel i5-4690k @ 4.5-4.6 GHz
NVIDIA Geforce GTX 960 4GB VRAM
8GB RAM
at the lowest settings to play with and I achieve a normal amount of 60fps capped, I didnt try to uncap it because it would probably grill my PC.

The Story so far is very nice, I kinda wished, that there would be more to it. after getting to 44% story you make 2 missions and then you are told, that there is only one more mission to make to complete the game, so you should prep for that. 

The Characters feel very different from one another, yet are always the same to play with. You mostly want to just use ranged attacks for anything, as getting near enemies on hard or higher difficulty would nearly instantly kill you. If you somehow are near an enemy you will have to mash your dodge button so hard it gets nearly impossible to hit them back. with Iron Man being available I, as a big Iron Man fan, thought it will be very easy from then on since he can fly and shoot repulsors rapidly at others but well, you cant do that. He needs to charge his bar every four to five repulsor shots. you could also use his lasers, but they dont do much damage, even though you are constantly hitting the enemies with it. He also utilizes rockets, which do a little more damage, grant heavy knockback and disrupt most enemies from hitting you and it even is a little AoE damage since it explodes but again, you will have to wait for his bar to charge after four to five shots.

The generel problem, at least for me, is a completely different thing: My game just crashes without a warning or a crash message. I am in the middle of a fight and it just closes as if it never was played. This is very frustrating for me because it normally crashes while I am in the HARM-room and it is quite hard in there to manage the higher missions in it, especially on the higher difficulty settings (I started out on brutal but went to hard after getting the Hulk as he is a hard character for me to play with) and I therefor am quite pissed on that.

I never experienced other game bugs that others are describing, but that doesnt mean that those dont exist. 

If you want to buy this game it might be advisible to wait, until it is in a sale or most of the negative reviews are disappearing.

15,75471867,english,"I wish there was a sideways thumb because this is mixed for sure. 

The story is pretty good I think, I thought the main character Kamala Khan (Ms. Marvel) was rather endearing and to me the story/characters came together in a nice way. MODOK was done well and it gave good hints of what's to come while also being a decent plot featuring the Inhumans.

The most dreadful part is the combat, every single sin of action games is here. Stagger/stun locks, enemies able to combo you while you're in a hard knockdown state, homing projectiles (hitscan and rockets), projectiles that interrupt you, very very tight parry timing in hectic situations (10+ enemies, at least 50% ranged taking potshots to interrupt your parry), it feels like a good amount of the enemies have super armor but even Hulk doesn't have any super armor, and worst of all on the hardest difficulty 50% or greater of the attacks are unblockable and sometimes they stagger+home.

It feels like Devil May Cry 2. If you've never played Nier: Automata, Devil May Cry 3/4/5, Bayonetta 1/2, Batman Arkham Series, Spider-Man PS4. Those are definitely games in this genre you should be checking out first in my opinion.

P.S. There's pretty dreadful performance (dips to 10-20 fps on 2070 super with dynamic resolution scaling on), sometimes it goes straight slideshow, most of the time though I would say it's alright. The matchmaking is straight up broken, and the monetization is pretty questionable.

59,75468892,english,"People want this game to fail because it has a ""games as service"" model and the beta was fairly buggy. I decided to give it a real try, and I think you should too. I've now played through the campaign and dipped into the multiplayer, and I've had a great time. 

The story was compelling (and felt complete without the promised free DLC), the characters very quickly distinguish themselves from the MCU in good ways, and in general I'm excited that there will be more added to the 20 hour campaign with a live service. I've already got my money's worth, but I plan to keep playing as I've barely scraped the surface of the combat and talent systems on even the highest level character I have. Seriously, even if you stick to the same character throughout the campaign as much as you are able, you''ll still have like 5 skill trees to fill out and customize for each character. It takes some time to be truly good at the game and learn the movesets, and its always expanding as you add more talents. Then of course there's gear on top of that, but so far since I'm not at max level, it's still just mostly about equipping the highest item level. What little I've seen is standard but diverse enough to be interesting.

To quickly address some things people often cite about the game:
- MTX. Honestly if you like the game enough to play it often, you'll get all the battle pass style stuff for free, and from my perspective, none of it is really that cool that you'll feel like you'll need it. Easy to ignore, and all doable and free if you care. The meat of the progression and fun is in talents that give you new moves, learning to use them well, and the gear that helps prop up your chosen style.
- Bugs. I will say the game had two hard crashes in my time playing due to video driver issues. Once the game ready drivers come out, I imagine that will be cleaned up. Even then, twice in 20 hours is not the end of the world. I haven't ran into bugs otherwise.
- Framerate. The frame rate of the game is not great, but with some tweaks I found it easy enough to keep 50 to 60 frames 95% of the time. I think the special effects were a real killer, so I turned those down right away and dropped some lighting that was trying to individually light a billion particles I can barely see on the screen as well.

Worthy to note that this game will have heroes, stories and maps added to the game for free, with that argument you will think most people will love it, but no, most content creators took it as the new punching bag, and they complain about everything, ""paid battle pass"" for each hero, when in reality you earn enough credits in the game to purchase all future battle passes without spending a cent.

71,75467737,english,"TLDR; Fun game and if you're a fan of the Avengers you really should experience it. For everyone else, it is a fun action RPG that is oddly very similar to Destiny. It is hard to say how this game will turn out with post content updates. 

My thoughts on the game: Avengers Assemble!

This is a good game and really a must play if you are a fan of the Avengers. The story is worth it alone with great voice acting and awesome fan pleasing scenes. 

Game play wise it is fun, the combat feels great once you start leveling up and unlocking more abilities, figuring out how to use the abilities to counter and dodge. You might be surprised how deep it can be other than spamming light and heavy attack, although you can get away with doing just that (probably not on harder difficulties).

Each hero does feel unique but they all have an ""answer"" for everything.  Meaning each character can deal with anything, you don't have to play as Iron Man to blast guys out of the sky, Hulk can do that too by throwing boulders and Ms. Marvel has stretchy arms that hit bad guys from afar. So you can play whatever hero you like best. That's not to say they are all the same, they aren't. You will have your preferred hero. 

Getting new loot is exciting like you'd expect although during most of the story you wont notice much of an impact. The main thing to go after is increasing your Power level. Some gear will have passives that increase ""something"" or do ""something"" when equipped. Most gear can also be boosted up to higher power levels by dismantling older gear or find parts in the missions. You should not have any issues with keeping your power level high enough to tackle the main story missions but other optional missions require you to have much higher levels to complete.

Oddly enough this game takes a lot from Destiny, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. For example you will eventually get access to various factions that you can take bounties and daily challenges which when competed offer faction reputation. Higher reputation allows you to purchase better gear. Your Power level is similar to Light level. The way you dismantle gear is the same. None of this is bad by any means but if you have played Destiny before you should feel right at home here. 

Another thing that is odd is that campaign missions are solo only. All other missions can be played with others online. I am not sure the reasoning behind this, I'm guessing it has to do with the cut scenes and making sure no one ""ruins"" your story play through, but I would have loved the option to play with my friends during some of those missions. 

Only time will tell where this game leads. Later on down the road they could potentially add X-Men, technically Wolverine was an Avenger and who knows what other threats they could add in. This game could continue to evolve over time and become great. I also think its complete BS that Spider Man is PlayStation only. I personally could care less about playing as Spider Man but for them to make a whole hero locked to one platform without even the option for others to purchase is kinda shitty in my opinion. They have stated that he will be the only one like that but we will see. Even so, if you're on the fence about this game I still say its worth it for the story. If you have any questions feel free to ask me. I do plan on playing this game online and learning as much as I can about it.

88,75466680,english,"Marvel’s Avengers can easily be summed up as “it’s Destiny but a brawler instead of an fps.”
There are power levels on your gear, daily and weekly challenges, faction rep/vendors, and about a dozen different currencies and mats for buying and upgrading. No open world, you select your missions from a map in your base.

Combat is fun and satisfying. Every hero feels and plays differently. All will have light, heavy, and ranged attacks, but for example Iron Man’s heavy uses his pulse cannons and drains his energy, while Kamala’s ranged attack can grab and move enemies but has far less range. Add to that different combos and powers to use, and I’d say the only way they could have done a better job is if they had given every hero their own game.

This game is obviously built with co-op in mind, lots of objectives reminiscent of Destiny. However you can bring in your other heroes as AI to help you, so it is very singleplayer friendly.

Story missions feel unique but don’t transcend what this game is, a fun co-op brawler. If you really wanted an amazing immersive singleplayer Marvel adventure, this game will fall short of that, but it still has a lot to offer.

5,75455920,english,"Love the game, few bugs. But what game doesn't have bugs now days at launch? None were game breaking.
Each character feels and move totally different from each other. 
The story is top notch, fun and exciting.
Been playing through the campaign during early access. Due to limited numbers for match making and to just wanting fully take in a mission and not rush through it like people did in the beta i've been playing solo. 
The companion hero are rather useful in some situations and in others they are terrible, multi floor fights with endless waves until the objective is destroyed i've noticed are their achilles heel. They don't always follow you or make their way up with you which can lead you to be overpowered at the objective. Which its not entirely your fault. 
There is no way to even tell the NPC Avengers to ""assemble"" on you when they have wandered to far in the fight. Except for [spoiler] Cap [/spoiler] he does have an ability called Rally, while its actually a attack buff it does make them all attack the same target, which feel more by accident assembles the Avengers.
Playing each character does feel completely different, and its not just in the DPS vs. Tank rolls. All the characters have light, heavy, and ranged attacks but the way its implemented is where it shines. The Hulk lumbers or steam rolls into a fight doing slow but heavy hitting attacks more about managing the hits your take well with rage and getting your Hulk Smash on. Black widow of the other hand if she gets surrounded shes likely going to go down but shes got the maneuverability to not be there, but she can have the highest damage output on the team. 
I don't want to go into much detail about each character as part of the fun is figuring out the different play styles of each character. But sticking with my examples if you play Hulk like Black Widow you'll die and if you play Black Widow like Hulk you'll kill a few then die from being out numbered.

Now Some Bullet Points

Pros:
-Exceptional Story (SE is known for good stories in games)
-Great Characters Feel Diverse In Play styles
-Ability Customization (between gear and other move specializations)
-Superheros (because duh)
-Great Graphics (runs smooth on the machine and a lot of options to assist with getting that perfect FPS)
-Free Updates for the game (they are free, free is good)
-Daily Tasks (these range from simple tasks that happen while you play to more complex difficult missions)

Cons:
-If playing online (from the beta experience), people can rush through missions making it hard to enjoy. But they usually do put a marker that requires the team to all be at to continue to the next stage of the mission
-Popular Hero's are going to be popular when playing online. While this shouldn't stop you from finding a match could make a longer wait time. But as the roster grows should be solved in time.
-Some of the keyboard controls are in weird places by default (EX. left mouse is light attack, f key is heavy attack, q is parry, left ctrl is dodge)
-Shops in the game randomly stock items and refresh items after hours, with no option to refresh the list now (good if your trying to get something and need extra what ever to get it, sucks if they don't have what you want)
-Item price in game shop doesn't match the grind you go through for it. (EX. the cosmetic shop stuff costs 1200+ units to rare stuff being 3200+ units. Units are gained about 10 at a time from random boxes in missions. More just needs to be balanced more)

Bugs:
-Some bugs nothing game breaking just needs more spit and polish. Mostly animations failing to play and some character audio dropping out for background chatter.
-Sometimes while climbing your character will animation lock at the end of the climb jump fixes it. But has resulted in being downed after climbing
-Being killed while still in animation lock for take downs. In a take down you cant be hurt but at the end for  certain ones sometimes you haven't been returned control yet but are able to be injured and downed.
-Being Revived comes with a few seconds invulnerability buff that i've been killed in while the standing up animation is playing and i don't have control
-Menu navigation can be buggy sometimes
-Day one patch broke aspects that were working, such at memory leaks and enemies disappearing.

In Summary i would recommend this game. SE is a solid company and has been around for a while and has a history of doing great stories and taking care of games over long terms which is their goal for this game.",1599265762,1599282390,True,0,1,0.493827164173126221,0,True,False,False,76561197992805753,173,34,5624,143,3495,1601003253
6,75460278,english,"Very enjoyable combat, and pretty nice campaign story that make the entry price worth it knowing that there's more to come for the story and unlocking new Avengers to play as.
I was glued in my seat while playing to get to the next story beat, and the more directed missions felt amazing to play through.
The free form combo system is very rewarding once you begin to unlock skills that define the characters, and air juggling is super fun.
I've liked the couple of end-game missions that I played that included cinematics and am looking forward to playing through the new ones that come out.
Characters feel unique and give you different ways to approach a fight.
Gear is pretty well done in that when you get an upgrade or specific effect, you can directly see the impact in gameplay. I don't care that it doesn't change the look of the character due to costumes, but maybe that might be important to you.
Breaking down gear is kind of annoying due to having to repeat it for each piece, and we should just have a favorite button and then a button to break down the rest instead of an equip best gear button that isn't actually that good at picking the best gear.
AI can be wonky/downright stupid sometimes.
There's a few issues with quality of life like breaking down gear as mentioned above, getting to areas that require hacking or breaking doors when you're solo as someone who can't, and walking through the Chimera to get stuff done taking just way too fucking long.
It has some areas with fairly uninspired level design and some that I think look pretty cool.
The pacing of progression through the main storyline due to the inclusion of the multiplayer missions prior to finishing the story makes it feel a bit unstructured. I think it would've felt much better to just let the entire story play through naturally before including literally any multiplayer until Avengers Initiative (end game).
Matchmaking is broken. I didn't crash a single time during beta and now I crash once every few hours.
It needs more villains, even garbage tier villains thrown in as minibosses, because enemy variety could use some more personality. They're the avengers, they should be fighting mostly villains.
Speaking of pacing, sometimes missions end abruptly after finishing an objective, even with enemies still on screen or in the middle of a combo. It should let or require the player finish wiping the board before ending the mission, and do it in a way that feels more immersive.
There is some gameplay balancing that needs to probably be tuned better, but it's not game breaking. Difficulty is artificial -- don't play on hard or brutal unless you like repeating a section because you got sniped by an off screen enemy. However, when your gear level is similar, the game still provides some challenge due to the number of opponents but has much less insta-death/sponginess.
Challenge cards aren't that bad since they're included with the purchase price, give you enough for a new card plus some, and DO NOT EXPIRE. You don't need to pay a single cent over the box price for this game unless you're impatient, and that's not predatory -- that's consumer friendly.
Other microtransactions are ridiculously overpriced for a paid game, but are just cosmetic. They would make more money anyway if they were reasonably priced, so I don't get that decision. Most skins can be paid for with in-game currency.

I don't want to rate it because the campaign and the end game are fairly different and we don't know how the story or raiding DLC is going to shake out yet.

Don't buy this game looking for a Destiny-like, at least for now. I think end game is probably going to be designed around coming back whenever there's an update, beating that content, and then stopping until the next patch.

DO buy it if you like beat em ups or games with decent combat system that relies on player skill and combo creativity that feels kind of like a DMC/Arkham mashup at times, if you like the Avengers, and you like a well made campaign with free post-launch characters and storylines... but understand that it is a flawed experience that probably got released a little too soon with some polishing left to do for the end game content.

Ultimately, it's worth picking up from somewhere like GMG with their weird discount system for under $50 if what I said above fits your taste.",1599273446,1599282366,True,0,0,0.495426803827285767,0,True,False,False,76561197964399131,679,10,2770,167,1311,1600916734

And for me that's fine, in the mediocre history of Marvel games this is one of the better ones outside of Spider-Man games. It's biggest problem is it lacks charm and is buggy as hell, but being a live service game doesn't do it any favors either. 

Luckily all the things you buy with real money are just cosmetic, so it's negligible. The problem comes from the actual gameplay being built around RPG elements, as these powerful super heroes won't feel as powerful as they should in multiplayer missions. It also doesn't help that the missions are incredibly boring and repetitive, not living up to any kind of super hero fantasy. Luckily the characters play as you would expect and that at least makes the combat somewhat better than it looks. It's obviously not complex, but it's about what I expected. 

Story is braindead, dialogue is so corny and out-of-character that once again that lack of charm really makes itself known. Aside from being an okay game, there's nothing really much else going for it and maybe that's the biggest problem. For a comic book inspired game, it's very uninspired and bland.

Con:
-Short story.
- Only 6 characters to play as. 
-60% of the time get smacked from nowhere.
-the kid makes too many 'hero speeches'.

Pros:
-nice cutscenes and pretty world.
-any time Bruce Banner is in a scene, the voice and acting, beautiful.

Final Thoughts:
-buy it at $60, nah. Buy it at $40, nah. Buy it at $20, maybe.
-wanted it to feed my Marvel Ultimate Alliance itch that I grew up on back on the Xbox 360, but only scratched 40% of the itch.

Conclusion:
If you want to get it cuz its Marvel, feel free. Do I recommend this to my friends... nah, but buy at your own spare expenses if you really want to play.

I can't remember getting so pissed off at a game since the Xbox 360 era of trash movie game adaptations. I cannot express how actually unfun this game is. There are so many parts of this game that feel that the developers really and I MEAN REALLY actively worked to develop the game as unfun as possible. The Walmart Avengers stunt doubles you play during the campaign feel so brittle they might as well be made out of paper mache. I struggled to think of who this game is actually made for. I think deep down square enix imagined a literal walking wallet with arms and legs dumb enough to waste their hard earned money on the micro transactions of their Avengers in game Disney store.,1599278722,1599278722,False,2,1,0.513513505458831787,0,True,False,False,76561197988060289,960,18,2412,0,968,1599521923
43,75463509,english,"I've played the game and I've enjoyed a lot of things about it so far, this game holds a lot of potential and this may be too early but I'm 4 hours into the game and I just need to talk about it.

The Pros-
- The characters all have that team essence allowing you to work with a lot of people using different characters to finish a mission, me and my friend have had a lot of fun and every mission was amazing up until now
- The voice acting while cheesy and not what you expected is actually done pretty well, especially with flushing out the characters and their emotions. I didn't see any major issues with any of them and quite liked it!

The cons-
- I'm not sure if this is me or the game but I've noticed it's large requirement for the game to be played, I have a very strong PC but I do encounter a lot of frame drops that maker it look like powerpoint and a lot of stutters, remember this is in early access so these could change to make it flow much nicer but I thought I should bring this up for everyone with a pc that isn't the strongest.
- Again this game is in it's early infancy so I am expecting some balance changes since a lot of the missions right off the bat require high power levels that could take a lot of grinding, I can say that enemies with elemental effects feel like the do more damage than the Hulk in some cases, but I do love the combat and the ways you can get around that for example his rocks to throw them off or his charge ability to knock them on their asses

My question-
- If people are offline and still want to play high level deadzones why not have them call upon a hero that they unlocked to assist them like that Hulk mission, up until that point I've not seen the ability to call for more members on the offline side. Will this be changed on full release?

Final thoughts-
This game is already amazing and I know even with the some of the glitches like Khan jumping through the wall at the beginning of Starks mansion (Which was funny and not at all bad) or the PC requirements being subjugated to various forms of torture in the beginning of a scene will not swade my opinion on putting this game on my high tier list, this game is worth the price tag (especially if you wanna spend a little more for the deluxe), with everything said and done I hope you can all find some sort of understanding to the early stages and hope to see one of you in my party for some destruction.

45,75463173,english,"So, I'd like to start by saying that Marvel's Avengers is in no way, shape or form a perfect game.
I think that for anyone who is indifferent about the Marvel Universe or to the Super Hero genre as a whole, this game will be one of those that you will pick up, play for 5 to 10 hours and then you will forget about it.

Having said that, I do believe that despite it's many flaws, the people who consume this type of stuff on the regular (the Marvel fans who watched every movie, the people who collect tons of comics, the audience that follows Marvel the same way the Star Wars's audience follows that universe), those people will try their best to like this game and they will succeed in doing so.

If you are willing to give this game a chance, despite the occasional crash, the somewhat clanky gameplay, the not so great optimization or the destiny like grind, believe me that this game can be very fun!
If you are able to enjoy it with friends, than the experience becomes even better.

Despite it's lows, the character development in this game can really make you enjoy the characters a lot more... Together with the voice acting from some of the best in the business and a story telling that can really get you immersed, in conjunction with the despite clunky but still fun gameplay and the promise from the developers to bring even more, if you are willing to oversee it's flaws you can really have some good moments in this game.

The gameplay is not easy... It is not hardcore either, but the casual Joe will have some trouble grasping the fighting patterns. In a way, it feels kinda like a Batman game except you are not so safe whenever you are doing your moves. It can be simple to understand, but it will require some experience fighting with every different Avenger and against all the enemy types (especially when they all jump on you at the same time).

In the end of the day, I truly believe this is the best representation these characters have ever had in videogame form. Not only by the way they look, but also by they way they sound and by the way you control them. Each character truly feels unique and hopefully the characters to come will be as fun.",1599278118,1599278118,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,76561198016550381,363,13,6217,1951,1450,1602021269

I totally understand the people who played the beta and complain that all the characters feel ""same-y"" and simple. But I also realize that anyone saying that likely didn't level the characters very far. The intrinsic skills immediately start to differentiate characters. Then when they make their way up the primary tree, they start to slowly become more and more distinct, and need an understanding of that character. And that's without even accessing the other two skill trees, which are almost purely skill customization modifiers, and without any kind of gear build.

The difficulty you're playing on also makes a significant difference in how much you need to really utilize your characters specialized skills. For example, on harder difficulties, Hulk gets torn to shreds at low levels if you aren't managing his rage. And that makes his intrinsic section of the skill tree have a lot of impact. And some of the gear perks, like health boost on critical health will make a lot of difference to this stuff, especially at higher levels.

I bought the game for the end-game co-op loot grinder beatem up. But after finishing the campaign, part of me wishes it were a single player 100 hour campaign. They really surprised me with the story campaign. IMO it's superior to a handful of the MCU films. Good stuff.

There's some work to do, and some QOL stuff that will need to come along. But for a game at release, I couldn't be much happier with what Crystal Dynamics has provided with this one.

all the heroes and future content will be free. there is a battlepass (challenge card) but the first 6 are free and you earn 1300 coins from them so you wouldn't have to pay anything for the new ones which will be 1000 per hero when they come out and the old ones don't have a timer so you don't have to work yourself to the bone to get everything before it goes away.

combat is great each character feels fun to use, even ms.marvel is good. with plenty of skills down the tree and higher levels has masteries that can be switch at will to change buffs to your ultimate moves like causing everything you kill to drop health or increased damage.

The loot is pretty neat addition along with the hidden files and comic books. I played the beta a couple weekends ago and will confirm I enjoyed it as well.
I think some balancing would be a good thing. The most popular complaint is Hulk feels a bit weak at times its not major but it is noticeable.

What I Like:
- Story Has Epic Scope!
- Main casts are very likeable.
- Combat is satisfying and fun. (Easy to understand, difficult to master) 
- Diverse skill trees. (3 large skill trees for each hero) 
- You can mix and match different skills and pull off some really cool combos once you've learnt a character properly.
- Even though every hero starts out playing quite similar, you quickly learn they excel in different ways through leveling up and picking different skills to invest in. 

What I Don't Like:
- Some rather lame side quests.
- Loots are basically just numbers and I don't care much about them. 

What Else? 
- Don't worry about the micro transactions because they are all cosmetics only and not invasive. 
- The 6 heroes at launch will keep you playing for quite a bit because of the varied skill trees and there will be more free heroes coming later (Black Panther, Kate Bishop, Hawkeye etc.) so longevity is not a problem at all.",1599272576,1599272886,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198077309258,66,4,4095,209,585,1601781734

Could this be a game you play for a bit?  So far im nearing 40 hrs and still haven't finished all the quests.  Im close, I think.  As I said the main story is a good story.  Im surpised by this, as lately marvel lately has been going on the woke side.  But the story is a heartfelt one that really does have a great use of your time.  I grew up reading marvels, starting in the 80s and up to roughly 2000.   So all the old characters are great.  Iron Mam, Captain America, Widow and my fav Thor all play different.  Thats a good thing.  

Yes the game can get a bit the same ole same ole after a bit.  But 40 hours, of gameplay in I still havent maxed out all the character.  Im close on 2 of the 6.

Bugs
• 1 Crash
• 1 Soft Lock
• Several Graphical Bugs which had no effect on the game but were funny to look at.
• A Certain Character Chasing me around in T-Pose outside of Combat.
• Some Very Slight Audio issues that were fixed within 2 seconds during Cutscene's only noticed it twice.

Pro's
• A Wonderful Experience as a Fan of the Avengers
• Kamala was a joy to ""Experience""
• Character interactions are fun
• All in All Combat is Enjoyable
• New Skills make a character better in a nice way.

Con's 
• Gear. If you go into a mission and your gear is not up to snuff (I mean within like 3) You can get your booty whooped quickly and readily. Gear is thrown at you quite quickly, but its still somewhat annoying when you are behind. 
• The Bugs. While some charming are a bit off-putting, Kamala not moving her body but her neck spinning around would be funny if I wasn't terrified. 
• Wait times for people to join missions are a bit slow. Obviously wont be a problem if you are playing with Friends.
• Combat.

It's great to just turn your brain off and beat up a bunch of people in a pretty satisfying combat system. The characters are great, minus Kamala, and actually got a few laughs out of me. 
Besides some minor bugs (the Abomination fight got annoying), the only complain I have is Kamala. The cringy fan girl gets annoying REAL fast, and ""OMG!! YOU'RE THE HULK!!!"" can only go so far. Also, Tony Stark's super secret password for his top secret account was ""Iron Man"", and for some reason no one could figure that out except Kamala because she's ""such a super fan"" (see my point).
This game is a genuine return to games of the past, a nice and easy linear story mode with some side content to keep the player playing a few more hours after the campaign, but nothing else than that.
I'd buy this now if you are some insane Marvel fan or if you just want a nice and easy game with a satisfying combat system. I HIGHLY recommend watching some of this game prior to purchasing.

For example in my opinion Tony in this game almost does justice to RDJ's Tony, which lets be honest is pretty hard to do. Graphics are extremely good, the game looks beautiful and although some say it doesn't run well on their 2080 TI's, I've managed to run it on max on my 1060 ( in some not very intensive scenes ) but usually run it on medium with very smooth gameplay. This is a combination of optimising the graphics settings, your nvidia drivers, undervolting gpu and more, no need to get into detail just search google.

There are negatives however, in the form of bugs, not many villains, and for now, post-story gameplay. I hope future patches will address many of these issues and make the game more fun... 

Lastly, It seems that Marvel Heroes was a step above this in terms of combat system, loot system, number of playable characters and even villains and many more, so I'm hoping they can do something to at least get on the same level as that game, since they're not planning to bring it back.

Also, the story may seem different from what I'm used to, but it really does make a big impact in the settings.

92,75454727,english,"Marvel's Avengers has been the spark of mystery in the months leading up to it's official release. Now finally, with the game only days away and the game ready to go we can now paint a firm picture of how the game truly is.
However, it's hard to know what to expect from this game, no doubt you have likely run into countless streams and recommendations on you-tube with titles that give extreme and often melodramatic impressions such as ""this game is SO GOOD"", ""I'm deeply concerned"" and ""this is the most risky pre-order"" to name a few.
My advice is to ignore as much influence as you can and judge it for yourself as I did, so you can paint the picture and not someone else.
That being said, the purpose of this review is to provide clarity and a clear picture of my experience with the game to hopefully help you in your decision of whether or not you should buy this.

Launching the game puts you straight into the action where you are introduced to Ms Marvel and the main cast of avengers in a solid introduction and shortly after their respective play-styles. Immediately I noticed that some characters were much more enjoyable than others but all were distinguished by a unique play-style.
Thor=Tank like build with Kratos like game-play with limited ranged abilities
Iron-man=Mobile medium hitter with diverse long range and short range abilities
Black Widow=Standard 3rd person shooting mechanics with some surprisingly diverse set of abilities such as a grappling hook and invisibility to name a few.
Hulk=Up close brute/tank with good crowd control and some unique special attacks
Captain America=Sturdy offence class, crowd control with grounded abilities
Some characters definitely felt better than others but the gap between their fun factor was not large and is also subject to personal taste. I myself prefer high mobility and adaptability and found myself gravitating towards Iron-man and Black Widow the most.

THE AVENGERS DO NOT FEEL WEAK!
Many have brought up this issue that the avengers feel weak, specifically the Hulk. Initially my experience was similar, the Hulk seemed to get stunned to easy and going from lifting a tank in the first level to getting stunned by a small robot was quite underwhelming. However, the more I played, the less I spammed left click and the more I took advantage of the hulks ability's. Specifically pressing Q allows the Hulk to gain poise giving you the opportunity to deliver a beat down while also building up your special to keep the ball rolling.
The other heroes felt balanced and it's clear that the game wants you to participate as a team to accomplish goals. A great example is iron man managing aerial threats while hulk delivers the beat down on heavy's that are on the ground while Black Widow is working on hacking consoles. This unique setup encourages teamwork and penalises the one man show play-style which I think is great.
Graphics are also great with highly detailed environments ranging from forest, industrial labs to the helli-carrier and a snowy tundra providing plenty of variety while also making progression through the levels enjoyable. These terrains are not just for show either, it was a pleasant surprise to see that the environments would have modifiers depending on the location and different gear or play-styles would be necessary.
Loot and other extras were not an issue, I found myself coming across them naturally and they often felt as a nice reward for exploring the environments.
If you want proof of how powerful some avengers can be and how fun they are to play, look up game-play of Thor or Iron man with majority of their tech trees filled out. 

The story is a solid 8.5/10 and we get to see a different side to some of the characters and how they have changed since the games proclaimed A day. For example Bruce is conflicted between his views on the avengers, originally testifying against them only to change his mind and fight for a revival of what once was and could be again. Interactions between Bruce and Ms Marvel are great to, the awkwardness feels real enough although some interactions can be exaggerated. Most importantly the story gives purpose to the players actions and it makes me keen to see what comes next.
Some things did fall out of place for me, the game would stutter on occasion and I crashed on one instance. FPS would often dip to a low 50fps on my 1070 i7 setup at high settings during high combat scenarios but ran smooth for 95% of my play-through above 60 fps. Hulks jump felt odd in more enclosed areas and feels like it would benefit from a larger, more open environment.

Looking at some reviews for this game on you-tube and steam alike, it is clear that so many had already made their minds up about what they thought about the game is before playing it or have gone into the game looking for the worst. This is the first time that I have strayed away from the opinions of my trusted online reviewers and finally forged an opinion based on my own experience and despite what the overwhelming masses have to say. For me it came down to one simple question, Am I having fun? and the answer is yes and I think any one who buys this will to.

So what is my verdict?
Marvel's avengers has surpassed my expectations in some fields and has fallen short in others. Despite what others may say about the game having dull combat I instead found the characters to feel unique and that their potential has been realised enough to justify a purchase. This coupled with a truly great story, great characters and environments that make the game fun to play I feel like the game is certainly worth your time.",1599263716,1599263716,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198060369505,126,8,4072,0,885,1600731194

However I though Banner's melancholy was done really well.

You end up playing all of the characters in the story mode. I thought that I would enjoy playing as the big name heroes the most. However, I ended up liking the character you experience the game's story through, Kamala, the best. She has incredible strength, long ranging attacks, quick way to recover, and traveling around the maps was an almost spider-man like experience with her stretchy arms acting as the webbing.

The only thing I wish was difference was that none of the heroes you bring along as companions on missions level up. Only the character you are playing levels up so you end up having to play as each hero a ton just to level up their skills and gear. This is especially annoying if there is a characters that you don't really enjoy their game play mechanics but like having them as a companion.

It is a great introduction to people who do not know the character. The combat is more defined than my expectations and multiple systems were created for it; it is essentially the framework of a shooter looter but with Marvel Characters.

Those who do not play shooter looters will call it grindy but that is just the nature of that genre, each character has its defined strengths and weaknesses and i 100% appreciate that. My eyes may be clouded with fanboy-ism since i collect comic books and i have always admired them but the rush of happiness from seeing a 4 man multiplayer group jumping/flying the rooftops and fighting together has me hooked.

Once you clear the campaign you are no longer forced to play different characters.

Cons - 
Few bugs like repeating voicelines; hanging animation getting locked until hard corrected by the code and the occasional load screen black out which fixes itself as well.

First the obvious. The graphics are stunning, to say the least. Crystal Dynamics really show what they are capable of and have done an outstanding job in bringing the Avengers to the game screen. Incredible texture detail(s) and lighting provide a depth and dare i say ""realism"" like no other game in recent memory for the PC. After the superb work done in Shadow of the Tomb Raider it boggles the mind how it's even possible to achieve better graphic's presentation. The level design is well crafted although straight forward for the most part. However, it doesn't give up it's momentum from the start of the game as you explore and engage in combat, pummeling enemies and objects throughout.  

Play control as well as the melee combat are solid and responsive. It doesn't seem ""janky"" at all compared to earlier builds of the Beta.  While playing, you'll find various materials in which to upgrade your character(s). This aspect ads more playability in that, you can build your characters play style the way you want to. While not massively in depth in terms of upgrades, there's plenty to work with here. I've reached the ""base"" level (carrier) so far. From what I've played in comparison to the Beta, the game has really been polished. The developers and publisher alike listened to the feedback from the Beta testers and it makes for a better experience overall.  

Sound quality is great, with sounds detailing the environments and character game-play. You can almost feel the impact in your bones as HULK obliterates his surroundings or anyone unwise enough to get in his way. The music is well done too and it's not annoying during game play. The only thing I wish and i think many, many players and fans out there would agree, is the lack of voices from the Avengers movie actors and actresses. It really would have made the game shine even brighter if we were able to hear them. But don't let that defer you from enjoying the game because the voice-work is still well done and not ""cheap"" in that regard. 

Crystal Dynamics have done an outstanding job in handling this game and I'm fully confident in any future installments which they may create. Or even other characters in their IP portfolio. Really hoping for a new Soul Reaver game. One can only hope. Very highly recommended.

Pros:
-Incredible graphics, animation(s), and environmental detail
-Outstanding level design, although a bit linear in scope 
-Excellent sound effects, music, and voice acting
-A decent story, very comic book-esque. It melds nicely in relation to the game-play
-Fun, creative, and engaging play control and game-play mechanics

Cons:
-Lacking the voices from the actors and actresses of the Avengers movies 
-Some of the jumping areas of the level(s) can be frustrating
-Some minor sync issues from level-load to game-play. As an example: The ""sewer"" part second area, when the main character begins to wade in the water while the enemy robots begin to appear. The enemies kept being alerted too fast causing reload of the checkpoint. It was only after a couple of tries did the scene move forward. Have to keep your finger on the forward button/forward key in order to move past the enemy robot, otherwise they'll detect you immediately",1599259766,1599259986,True,1,0,0.516574561595916748,0,True,False,False,76561197969402037,1017,50,420,0,326,1599426135

Things get repetitive after a while and the avengers themselves feel weak even after being upgraded, I feel some missions on harder difficulties are almost impossible if AI wasn't there to revive you. ( Yet again I could just be bad at the game XD)

48,75452379,english,"I kinda fought with my decision to rate a Yes recommend because this game is pretty cool. The little things like pinning enemies against the wall with thors Hammer. Really make this game an avengers game. However, The game feels like its incomplete. Let em explain. There are only two small time villains and one main villain. You wonder why you only see task master and Abomination in every war table and game-play video? that's because those are the only two you will be fighting for the next two months until new Battle passes are released. ""You want a new experience? Pay me now please..."" Kinda odd that a game that tells its community it wants to last for years to come really didn't even last longer that a few days... if not hours. This game will get repetitive after 8 or 10 hours. Like i said before its still fun. but I feel like the length of the game could have been further extended. They want you to play multi-player more but only give you single player bosses missions. Because there's nothing new after you beat the game. Also the game is heavily geared towards ""Go to the marketplace and spend your money."" Sure you can unlock stuff by playing but just like other games that say and do this... it's a horrible grind they plan to milk until enough people complain about it. So that's my review.

50,75452208,english,"if you're not really interested in comic books or marvel or whatever, don't rush to pay full price for this 
this is a really harmless and generic beat 'em up/character action game and it's definitely nothing special 
but i wouldn't really feel the need to wait for a deep sale if i'm being honest 
i actually like superheroes so i don't mind buying it at full price, and the combat is fun 
it can seem button mashy but i honestly think you're making it less fun for yourself if all you do is mash square/x to get through the game 
there are some fun things you can do with combos and mixing the characters' abilities together 
i also noticed a lot of hallmarks from crystal dynamics's tomb raider games, like some semi-janky movement (ms marvel especially feels like i'm just controlling reboot lara croft, which i don't necessarily mean as a negative) 
the double-press, two-stage dodge comes straight out of the tomb raider reboot 
and there are some sliding/running-away-from-bad-guys segments that remind me of the cinematic segments from those games as well 
but don't think that you'll like this game just because you liked the tomb raider reboot games, this is not really like them at all aside from those pretty specific details 
i noticed some mechanics similar to dmc, like actual juggling, and that's pretty fun 
there's also takedown moves you can do with y+b or triangle+square (i'm playing this with a ds4) which comes straight out of the batman arkham games 
and apparently there are some different unlockable takedown animations for each character 
ms marvel is basically the protagonist of the game, and the actual avengers take a bit of a backseat 
but the cast had to be grounded somehow
we've never seen this iteration of the avengers anywhere before so it might not have been the best idea to try to give them all in-depth characterization in just this game 
but unfortunately i think kamala is the least interesting character to play as, and you spend the first several hours playing exclusively as her 
i actually think hulk is the most fun character to play as, he is super satisfying and it's especially fun to do the move where you grab a smaller enemy and slam them around 
i think iron man is a close second and i really like his flight abilities 
if i had to give this game a number score it would probably be a 6 to 7 out of 10 
it's a harmless and generic game and it won't win any awards, but it's fun and that's most of what matters to me 
i'm perfectly content paying $60 for this, but i wouldn't fault you for waiting for a half-off sale

52,75452051,english,"I'm very lucky to not get the optimization issues others have gotten and hopefully they patch this game for those people very soon. My gaming rig is modest compared to some people who have had these issues so I am convinced the performance issues are a bug rather than just being poorly optimized, because the game can run super well under the right conditions!

I've played through the full story on PS4 before early access came to PC and I've been playing here too. I really enjoyed the story, it has some great set pieces and a lot of love was put into it. I have a few issues with the singleplayer campaign though. It's rather short compared to your Spider-Mans and God of Wars, and there is very little enemy variety (and ESPECIALLY boss variety). The game has 3 main 'factions' of enemies; AIM, Taskmaster goons, and Watchdogs. I believe that if these 3 factions were split evenly throughout the story, it would be a much more varied experience! But sadly this isn't the case, as Taskmaster's goons and Watchdogs only really appear for about 20 minutes in the story and the rest of the time you'll be fighting AIM enemies. There is variety in the AIM enemies themselves but I would have loved to see a more visually diverse set of enemies. And there are about 6 bosses in the game at launch, but only 3 of them are actual supervillains you'd expect to fight in a superhero game. The other 3 are basically big robots. I have hopes that this will be improved with future expansions but after seeing the post credits scenes and the trailers for the Hawkeye DLC story, I have a deep fear that we'll be seeing AIM a whole lot more in the future unfortunately.

There are numerous game breaking bugs that caused the game to crash or freeze, or just look really goofy. Sometimes a character will have the lowest mipmap of their textures spawn so they look blurry as heck, or sometimes a costume you can only unlock with real money or via the un-replayable story will just be... gone permanently. And this is both on PC and PS4. I think CD have a bit of progress to make before I can really feel safe enough to go ham on grinding in this game.

The gameplay is superb! It has an easy-to-use control scheme which I understand may tick off some people BUT it is really satisfying to find creative ways to combo enemies, and all the characters feel unique. If I were to rank them I'd say Black Widow > Captain America > Kamala > Hulk > Thor > Ironman. Ironman is a little underwhelming, because you'd expect to be able to play a full ranged build with him, but he's the ONLY character that has a limit on ranged attacks and forces you to fight with melee attacks which is a shame.

The game is hard during the early stages of the game because of your characters being limited in strength and abilities at the start, and the strength of enemies. But I've noticed that once you start upgrading your gear, it creates a snowball effect that allows your character to get better and better gear and get stronger constantly! It really improved the way I look at the game as I started focusing on improving my Hulk and he suddenly felt like an absolute machine! So I am very excited to playing at a higher level with better gear.",1599258945,1599258945,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198087702379,844,3,3623,57,556,1601665838

74,75451371,english,"TLDR: At $60 I can't recommend this as is i understand the epidemic messed a lot of things up but this game was clearly not ready for release bugs are everywhere from the game crashing constantly to sounds just not playing or breaking completely and even falling out of the world which admittedly only happened once. A disgusting in-game market with horrible pricing. This game wasn't pushed out the door it got kicked out. It seemed like the writers were the only ones actually trying here.


Avengers is a broken mess right from the word go. At the start i expected all the issues i had in the beta to be fixed by release like not being able to interact with things that are needed for progression to traversal only working when it wants to and such. I am getting ahead of myself though let's start with the story. I think it's good not amazing but it's a good Avengers story. I won't spoil anything but the story kept me engaged the entire time. To bad i can't say the same for the combat. The combat is repetitive and bland. Wanna play as your fav hero well cool pick anyone other than black widow since she kinda sucks. She is basically the hawk eye of this game where everyone gets decent power attacks and combos she is at such a disadvantage with almost nothing worth while to her name. Her ultimate is a literal stick with a you shall not pass button that is absolute garbage. Even Cap's ultimate turns his light attack into a constant shield throw giveing him more range but widow get's a stick THAT IS IT. You want a character that will get you through the post campaign stuff with relative ease pick the new comer Ms. Marvel since her abilities are the best of them all and can keep an entire group occupied and at range which in this game is OP as hell. The enemies will be the worst nightmare of your worst nightmare since there is always a massive group and there is no post hit invincibility so if you get swarmed and trust me you will it's gonna be game over before you can say HELP. The game is so broken however that even if your down and mind you you only get three downs the game may let the enemies take another one of those downs away from you even if you haven't  been revived yet. so prepare for a lot of unfair restarts and angry screaming. The gear and unlockables are nothing to wright home about either. the game lets you unlock comics for a power boost and they have the covers for real life comics which is cool TOO BAD YOU CAN""T ACTUALLY READ THEM. This would have been something great to keep me coming back to find more as there are several sets for several characters and may have even made me go out and want to read more of them BUT nope just a small insignificant stat boost and a pretty picture to look at YAY... The costumes are ok but none of them are worth getting since you will probably only use one or so and almost none to my knowledge are form the characters respective comics like in spider-man on PS4. I can't really speak for the others but aside from some pre-order costumes MS.Marvel to my knowledge only ever had three costumes she wore and i mean costumes not street cloths but i only see two the rest are made up for the game and don't even look good i end up only using the costume i got from beating the game. and don't get me started on the in-game market. I have never seen a more disgusting cash-grab IN MY LIFE $14 FOR A SINGLE COSTUME. The in-game market currency averages to about $1 for every 100 credits most of the ""legendary"" costumes in the market are 1400 credits THIS IS A JOKE, TOO BAD I FORGOT TO LAUGH. So in conclusion with the Good story, repetitive game-play, mountain of bugs, and disgusting in-game market this game is a hard pass. I wanted to like it, i wanted to run to my friends and say buy this so we can play together but i can't. In it's current state i can not recommend this game. Maybe when the game is patched and all the content is out i would say get it at a discount but as is DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! 4/10",1599257878,1599257878,False,10,0,0.531370401382446289,0,True,False,False,76561198041551639,1310,10,3392,0,2952,1600735048

Pros: 
-Excellent character design
-Good detail on graphics (like threads on uniforms, little design details, etc)
-Choosing your preferred hero to play as is cool
-Interesting and intriguing story

Cons:
-Combat feels slow, or overwhelming, no inbetween.
-VERY easily staggered/stun-locked by enemies
-Heroes feel vastly underpowered, and enemies feel vastly overpowered
-Save function isnt reliable*

Details:
This game has promise and i really want to like it but as it is right now, i cannot recommend this game to anyone. The story is really good IMO but the core component (combat) of the game isnt good at all. The worst part is the balance of heroes and enemies. I get that the heroes need to be dialed back a bit to actually add an element of difficulty to the game but this is The Avengers. The Hulk should not be getting staggered by the most basic enemy in the game, while he cannot stun or stagger the same enemy. [spoiler] Like how are you gonna show Kamala smack The Hulk straight in the chest and he doesnt budge at all, but a low level AIM drone hits him and he basically falls over...[/spoiler]. Honestly the only character who had reasonably good combat was Captain America. 

*: There are checkpoints and autosaves but the part that got me was, my game crashed during a boss fight and rather than picking up at the checkpoint, the game forced me to restart the entire mission. 

TL;DR: The character designs and personalities are perfectly on point and the story is enjoyable but its ruined by poor combat mechanics and wildly unbalanced enemies and heroes.

Can upgrade abilities and find useful loot, which adds some variability in combat and some strategy. 

Animations and graphics are pretty great, not gunna lie. But the core gameplay leaves me wanting either a more open world experience, or a more linear level system, similar to Tomb Raider's gameplay model. Haven't played with friends, but you have that mechanic to work with similar to Destiny.

6,75449896,english,"Do you like Destiny's game model? Do you enjoy Marvel Super Heroes? Are you a fan of face-paced frenetic combat and amazingly choreographed abilities?

Avenger's isn't perfect, and I'm writing this review from the 3 day early access. The campaign itself is fantastic. Yes, there's a lot of robot punching and similar goals/objectives, but the game play and mission style is varied with many set pieces. It was an amazing hero journey, on par with some of the best comic story arcs (or film), and could make for an amazing multi-episode high-budget TV show or something similar.

Basically, I love the game, campaign was superb and I want Square and CD to open it up so I can replay it again without changing any of my hero progress.

CONS

Weird mechanics for some things, it's a hybrid between Souls combat for dodging and parrying and the Arkham Batman series. Leads to getting hit or stun-locked despite doing everything 'right'. Can get very irritating.

Bugs - There are still quite a few that I've run into, HARM Room enemies falling through the floor/world as Hulk smashes them into oblivion, locking progress on the waves, death/revive triggers either locking you in a 'playable' death state that bugs out the AI and blocks progress (a reloaded checkpoint fixes it), Objective screens disappearing from the HUD and can't get them to come back.

There were some crashes, mostly hardware related due to nVidia 10-series cards having some issues requiring a new patch from nVidia themselves. I rolled back my driver and my computer thanked me. Annoying/Irritating bugs, but not enough to take away my enjoyment.


Ms Marvel - I was extremely skeptical about her inclusion due to the fact that politics/ideology seem to be influencing everything in our lives now. So, while I was very hesitant and resistant, she grew on me and the hero's journey here was a good enough story over all that I could ignore any possible intentions for the above. She's actually a very strong character, move set and build-wise, but her story in the game was great. She doesn't bring the game down at all.

Overall, 78-85% rating for the game, not the greatest I've ever played, but definitely up there in terms of love. I'll be playing this for a while to come. Each hero is unique when you start unlocking their skill trees and flying around a massive battle tank as Iron Man while the rest of the Avengers handle the ground threats was AMAZING.",1599255594,1599255594,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198057681571,140,5,10782,222,2449,1602060015

Could just be regular people if you didn't know better. She's a good character & fun to play with though & the voice acting is good but they could of had a better character.

The gear system is weird as well never really sure what to use so I find myself always using the equip best gear option, I'm sure if you look in to it a bit more then it would make more sense. There is skins in the game but you need to earn in game currency to get them, I didn't go out of my way to find any but ended up with enough to get one skin so I'm not sure if you can get enough to buy a skin for all 6 heroes but there is the option to buy the currency with real money if you really want a skin.

About a 22 hour EPIC story campaign. Let me explain that I've been playing games for about 40 years and this is the BEST representation of The Avengers I've ever played. They feel like themselves. When you play as Iron Man, you feel like you're Iron Man, same with all the heroes.

The combat is fluid and varied. The graphics are AMAZING, the sound is rich and deep. There's tons of costumes to unlock for each character. The RPG leveling and skill unlocks systems are DEEP. I'm talking 9 different skill trees per character, and tons of new moves and powers to unlock. Depth depth depth. And I'm just now getting into the multiplayer. 

I went into the game not knowing anything about it. It was basically, ""Oh Avengers? Here take my money."" and I am not disappointed. I'm actually upset that I have to stop playing and go do other things before I go to bed.

Extremely fun beat 'em up co-op game with deep customization! A contemporary Marvel Ultimate Alliance with Destiny elements.

[h1] Pros [/h1]
You play as the Avengers!
[b] Great custom combat [/b]
[list]
[*]Hero gameplay can specifically be customized to how you want to play them via perk trees
[*]Powerful abilities and melee attacks become more powerful as you augment them, for example [spoiler] I've been making a ranged Cap because the ricochet kick move feels very satisfying to me and now that it has been upgraded, I take out crowds easily [/spoiler]
[*]Supporting perks with proper gear can be devastating
[/list]
[b] Great co-op [/b]
[list]
[*]Quite a bit of variance: [spoiler] Large boss raids, villain raids, campaign style character driven missions, horde mode (Harm Room), domination objectives, rescue missions, dungeon style missions, etc [/spoiler]
[*]Most missions come with optional objectives
[/list]
[b] Fun custom skins [/b]
[list]
[*]They throw them at you, plenty of ways to earn skins for free
[*]Vendors, via completing missions, via [spoiler] unlocking in the tech lab [/spoiler]
[*]Seeing your own custom Avenger squad is pretty bad ass
[/list]

[h1] Cons [/h1]
Average optimization - 09.04.2020
[list]
[*]The FPS varies significantly depending on the area. All my friends I played with complained of this issue, all with varying GPUs
[/list]
Issues with models disappearing/reappearing during cinematics and gameplay
Connection issues causing crashes
Loading times can be long
Some hub layouts can be frustrating

[h1] Middle of the road [/h1]
[i] These aspects of the game can be good or bad, depending on your perspective [/i]

[b] Monetization [/b]
[list]
[*]There's hard currency (credits) and soft currency (units)
[*]There are ways to earn both by playing the game: [spoiler] completing Faction missions or exploring to get units and completing battle passes to earn around 1000 credits per pass [/spoiler]
[*]Battle pass for the starting 6 playable characters comes free
[*]Hard currency only pays for emotes, name plates, and skins
[*]Feels more like a choice to pay for custom content than RNG
[/list]
[b] Gear [/b]
[list]
[*]Can be a bit of a grind if you aren't paying attention to it
[*]Upgrading the right gear requires resources you receive from missions, receiving the most from exploration. If you aren't doing this during missions, you're shooting yourself in the foot
[*]Interesting gear effects and combat interaction
[*]Buying gear from vendors requires another soft currency (fragments) which you find by exploring missions
[/list]
[b] Campaign [/b]
[list]
[*]Average length, decent writing, great VA cast
[*]I enjoyed watching [spoiler] Kamala become Ms. Marvel and George Tarleton become MODOK [/spoiler]
[*]Feels like a model for how additional campaign missions with new heroes will be added. Short, sweet, and episodic
[*]Stay for the post credits scene and its implications for the future of the game
[/list]

I never had an issue feeling powerful in this game. Many of the customization options you unlock from leveling up your character make your attacks/abilities much more powerful based on your perks. I often found myself one or two shot killing enemies on Hard mode. I played a lot as Iron Man and [spoiler] his mega unibeam was almost too destructively powerful in the middle of the game [/spoiler]

Showing that superheros are humans too who have emotions and feelings and not just these larger than life people who never fail. While i would highly recommend this game i do have a few negatives. For one i think that the power system while very cool and unique, is kind of unbalanced. hulk can regen his health while having super armor, while thor has super armor and electric attacks. Sounds like thor is the cooler pick with his basic power but if he takes any damage during his, he loses basically the entire bar which feels very weird while hulk just carries on. Also this game is a buggy mess. sometimes its funny like characters floating or mething where they shouldnt . But it becomes a lot less fun when you have to restart a mission 7 times to get the right amount of high priority enemies to spawn so you can move on.

Yes loot doesn't change your appearance but do you really want your avenger to look like a fashion mistake because you don't have the right gears to match? There are a lot of good skins that the game just gives them to you. By simply finishing a mission or working your way through the character card. If you take time to see what kind of skins there are on character card then you will realise that it has almost all the best stuff there. And guess what, character card is free. Once you finish it, not only you will have the best skins for ur character but also will end up with 1300 credits which u can spend on future character cards of new heroes.

I am not blind to the problems this game has. The last enemy from an elite team getting shoved in the wall and I am not able to progress in the mission- This scenario will probably happen to you too.

Mission variety is also pretty basic but this is a live service game so don't judge completely from day 1. Its gonna improve with more characters and story and all for free. I love the monetisation model of this game and wish other games take something away from it.

[i][b]Marvel's Avengers[/b][/i] is a [b]third-person Action game with RPG elements[/b]. Players start playing as Kamala Khan, a young fan of Earth's Mightiest Heroes who'll try to reassemble the Avengers, split up and criminalized after the catastrophic events of A-Day. Surprisingly enough for a ‘GaaS’, the [b]story[/b] has a pretty [b]decent length and good writing[/b], and it’ll be [b]expanded[/b] for free as new content arrives.

Players are able to play with all the Avengers as soon as they unlock them in the Story Campaign. [b]Every character has its own unique playstyle[/b] which differs them from the rest. For example, Black Widow acts as the typical Rogue from any RPG, applying statuses and dispatching single enemies very quickly, while The Hulk is a tanky giant with a Taunt ability and massive AOE capabilities.

The [b]combat[/b] is pretty [b]straightforward and easy to learn[/b], but it hides a lot of [b]depth and mastery[/b] potential, with [b]three pages full of skills to unlock[/b]. Some skills have to be chosen over others, potentially changing the playstyle of the character. The game also allows the player to create combos that can be extended for long and complex sequences for devastating results.
As with many games of the genre nowadays, the game features a [b]dodge/parry mechanic[/b] resembling Batman: Arkham and Dark Souls, which is fundamental to learn quickly in order to survive the battles. As a bonus, every character features [b]three unique abilities[/b]: A Support ability to weaken enemies and help allies, an Assault ability to deal massive damage, and an Ultimate ability which deals even more massive damage… or even summon the Hulkbuster armor.

As with the [b]RPG elements[/b], the game features a [b]gearing system[/b] similar to Destiny. Enemies and missions will drop/reward different pieces of gear with random stats and quality that'll boost the character's power. Players will also be able to find resources while destroying enemies or exploring, which can be used to boost actual equipment or buy new one from NPC vendors.

[b]Visuals are extremely good[/b] and the game features a photo-mode to catch our favourite Heroes in amazing screenshots. Animations are top-notch and compliment the combat beautifully. Combos look very flashy.
On the other hand, [b]optimization[/b] seems to be a problem for some players, and FPS can drop exponentially in some scenarios, but it's stable overall.

Regarding [b]Missions[/b], [i][b]Marvel's Avengers[/b][/i] is a [b]lobby-type game[/b]. Once a mission is selected and a fireteam assembled, players will load and jump into the missions. There are [b]different types of missions[/b] and most of them allow the player and it's teammates (AI or other players) to explore decently [b]big open areas[/b] with secondary and hidden objectives. Sadly, these maps will get [b]repetitive[/b] very quickly.
As a [b]multiplayer-focused game[/b], it features [b]endgame content[/b] in the form of [b]Mega-Hives[/b], which could be defined as Nightfall Strikes from Destiny or Mythic+ dungeons from World of Warcraft, and [b]Villain Sectors[/b] in which fireteams will fight a [b]Supervillain Boss[/b]. New endgame mission types called ""[b]Operations[/b]'' will be added [b]post-launch[/b] and will feature the typical raid from any MMO, which will require high player cooperation and gear. There’ll be [b]special missions[/b] only available through weekends and in-game Events.
There’s also [b]daily missions[/b] which reward various resources and reputation with the two main factions of the game. With enough reputation level players will unlock more items to be bought from the vendors. These daily missions [b]aren’t a hassle[/b] to complete at all like other similar games, so players can (and should) accept them all in bulk and they’ll be completed automatically as players play other missions.
The game will launch with [b]80~ different Warzones[/b] (term used for Missions) with four levels of difficulty, so there’s plenty of missions to complete. Sadly, as well as Level Design, they get repetitive very soon.
As of today, there’s no information about the game getting some sort of PvP, so [b]only Coop multiplayer[/b] for the time being.

In the [b]Customization[/b] aspect, players are presented to a plethora of [b]skins, emotes, takedown animations and nameplates[/b] from the official Comics to customize their Heroes. A lot of them can be acquired with [b]Units (Free Currency, gained by playing the game)[/b] in NPC vendors, and others can only be obtained in the Marketplace with [b]Credits (Premium Currency, available to buy with real money)[/b] and via character [b]Challenge Cards[/b], which acts as Battle-Passes for every Hero. Thankfully, [b]players get all the Challenge Cards for the base game Heroes at no additional cost[/b].
Surprisingly, these Challenge Cards [b]do not have an expiration date[/b]. Once acquired, they can be completed whenever the player wants, so [b]no FOMO[/b] or pressure is involved with these.
The [b]Marketplace[/b] is the place where players can buy Cosmetics for Credits. Honestly, some of them are a [b]bit overpriced[/b], ranging from 2$ for a nameplate to an outrageous 14$ for some skins. These prices would be acceptable for a F2P game, but as a 60$ game, I can’t complain enough.
There’s a selection of cosmetics rotating every hour in the Marketplace and NPC Vendors, with three featured cosmetics rotating every week. Some skins will also be available only during certain events, so here’s where the FOMO could come in.

As for the [b]future[/b], Crystal Dynamics promises [b]regular new free content featuring new Heroes, Supervillains, Locations and Cosmetics[/b]. Aside from Challenge Cards for the new Heroes and cosmetics in general, [b]everything will be completely free[/b].

[h2][i][u]Personal Opinion[/u][/i][/h2]
[i][b]Marvel's Avengers[/b][/i] is not going to be a game for everyone. It's a 'GaaS' like Destiny, a [b]loot grinder[/b] with a repetitive gameplay loop, and not everyone enjoys that kind of gameplay. If you’re only looking forward to the Story Campaign, then you should wait for a sale.

For those who do enjoy it, they'll find a [b]great fun game[/b] despite its flaws, which I hope to be addressed soon or in the future. The combat never gets old and it's very satisfying, and with the FOMO tuned to the bare minimum, it's a game that [b]doesn't force you to play every day or feels like a second job[/b]. The game nails the [b]fantasy[/b] of playing as the Avengers, and every Hero is a different experience from another one, so learning to play every character will take some time and training.

[b]If anyone feels undecided because of the 'Game as a Service' and monetization, you shouldn't be afraid of it[/b]. Everything available for purchase with real money is [b]cosmetic[/b], and there’s plenty to buy with ingame money. Challenge Cards award a lot of amazing cosmetics and they're all given for free for the six base game characters.
Additionally, [b]Challenge Cards award 1.300 Credits when completed[/b] (7.800 Credits in total between all Challenge Cards), with 1.000 being the standard price for Challenge Cards, so [b]you can get the new ones for the new characters for free[/b], as well as a few premium goodies you decide to buy.",1599235492,1599252986,True,345,33,0.760361373424530029,0,True,False,False,76561198018818847,184,2,5840,862,1276,1601242538

besides the really good story it feels very short only really took me a day to finish next to the non stop crashes and weird animation on one of the captain America outfits the face doesn't move right i also experienced a duplicate issue with Kamala after a training mission 

Overall the issues are the biggest problems with avengers and the fact that multi-player is so SLOW when it shouldn't take long to find one player

My recommendation if you really wanna play this game since it is going to be pushed forward with new characters in lineup of future updates like Spider-Man and black panther id say just wait it out and see if a sale happens in a few weeks

Part of me thinks it should have been delayed and worked on more this is honestly my opinion the most Broken Game Launch of 2020 and its not even funny also shakiness to combat might turn some peoples heads away cause it sure did give me a headache 

Side note: turn off vibration and work out your settings before starting it will lag and skip scenes next to crashes put on Exclusive Full-screen it helped for me and lower your Resolution.

83,75446232,english,"The game can be fun. If solo player then I would recommend passing on the game as putting anything in the game that only certain characters can accomplish in a map makes no logical sense. ""Here is something extra but did is your favorite character one that can open it or did you play someone you didn't want to to open it?"" That to me seems horrible choice for playing who you want as you are punished for doing so.

There are decisions that make the flow of the game feel bad to me. Having charge attacks that get interrupted by any hit when need charge attacks to break shields can make it feel like I am being air juggled at times to finish off an enemy. Not being able to dodge tracking projectiles because stuck in a combo animation means taking free damage and if AoEs are on the ground then you get more. Plus there is only one hero to me that doesn't feel sluggish to me. I expected things to feel fast and instead feels like an extended slug fest. Maybe it is how slow everyone moves. Even flying feels no faster than sprinting.

That is not all. I will have to wait and see what else I find as I am curious about seeing what max level is like and whether it will be fun to jump in for a fix of playing one of the heroes or will just sit in my library. The grind at the moment is not fun.

Solo seems even worse as leveling up heroes that might not enjoy while depending on companions seems like frustration.

There's no Spiderman and even though that character and it's storyline/exclusive enemies etc will only be on the PS4/PS5 in 2021, it won't really matter cause the game will be dead far before then.

Maybe wait until the game goes on discount but again, by then, the online part of it will be dead for sure so if you're only looking to play campaign and don't care about the online parts, then go for it. Otherwise, like I said, hold out for a 40%+ discount on the game.

89,75445971,english,"Extremely well done story. Damn near MCU quality. IMO, worth the price of admission alone. I never really cared much for Kamala, but her journey here has endeared her to me =)

Graphics are top notch. I use the dynamic resolution option to keep things running smoothly on my 4k system - but even without it runs well enough for me. The ridiculous amount of debris you can cause with the Intel enhancement turned on is just insanely fun to experience =) 

Combat starts out simple and button-mashy - but as you level the heroes and get used to their skillsets it rather quickly evolves into a deep system of combos and counters, with passives altering moves and personalizing your hero. For me, a couple heroes felt kinda 'meh' until I got more of their skills unlocked - then they went from 'meh' to 'damn this hero is a blast!'.

The co-op side of the game is more or less what you would expect. If you've played Warframe, Destiny or The Division - you know what's in store. Lots of various repeatable missions that cycle over time, from quick and simple 10 minute drops to sprawling locations with many objectives, both optional and primary. Lots of loot, much of which give added damaged types, boosted stats and/or various types of proc chances - more uncommon are the bits that alter the way a skill behaves - those make things pretty interesting.

The pass system is well, a pass system - you earn points for the pass via two dailies and two weeklies at a time, per hero. Some don't like that the pass is time gated this way - I don't care.

The micro-transactions - right now I think emotes and finishers are perhaps a little overpriced - but everything else seems fair enough, relative to pricing in other games.

I've had a few crashes during the early access - not sure what is causing them but it seems to be something with either my graphics setup or my sound setup. Regardless, they have been very few and I usually am able to play for hours at a time with no interruptions. Other than that and a few UI glitches, I've not run into any major bugs or problems.

Hero Gameplay - The variety in character playstyle are diverse, with much more heroes to come.
Campaign -  Somewhat short with today's standards but overall a great unique experience. It may branch out even more with more campaign for new heroes.
RPG aspect - RPG aspect with loot and skill tree makes it a bit more interesting than just a plain beat em' up.
Free DLC - All new heroes and DLC moving forward will be free. 
Friends paradise - Awesome time to team up with friends doing missions

Negative:
Repetitive levels - Levels are re-used. About 2 hours of doing missions, you've probably seen all the maps the game has to offer, needs work.
Bugs - Lots of bugs that can be experience ruining with crashing, visual, or matchmaking, big issue that needs work.
In game shop? - It's all cosmetic, don't see this as a negative unless you have no self control but might as well put it in negative, you can grind in game currency to buy skins (Like Fall Guys) but it does take awhile to gain. 
Replayability in long sessions - It can be a bit of a slog since the repetitiveness is a bit bare. The combat/gameplay somewhat helps keep you engaged. 
Exclusive Hero - Spidey is going to be an exclusive hero for Playstation, let's hope it's just a timed exclusive though. 

Overall, this is a game that you can leave and pick up for the next couple of years, worth a buy, especially if you're a marvel fan. Whether you get it at 60 or a reduced price, up to you.

Replayability, after main story mission, all sidequests are all completed, and every Hero is maxed level, is minimal. I do recommend the game just for the story alone. Take all this with a grain of salt though

Pros :
1. Story is solid, but feels rushed towards the end, good voice acting for majority of the characters. 
2. Combat can be fun or utterly daunting and boring depending on Hero. 
3. Cosmetics are nice and doesn't impact gameplay in any way.
4. Diverse maps
5. Multiplayer's fun 
6. Fanservice 

Cons :
1. Minimal sidequests that tends to reuse the same map designs or encounters with different dialogue(s) thus becoming repetitive and boring after you do them 1-2 times.
2. Barely has any meaningful boss fights besides the final Boss. Would've been nice to fight other named Villains 
3. A few amount of bugs that can happen at any time which will sometimes require you to reload the most recent checkpoint to hopefully progress
3. Battle pass progression takes way too long especially when you have to focus on them one at a time.
4. No way to level up other heroes, like in Marvel Ultimate Alliance, unless you specifically play them.   
5. Only 2 enemy factions with diverse units. 
6. No option(s) to start a mission from anywhere else but the War Table. if you're at the dock bay on the Helicarrier and want to launch a mission you have to trudge back to the War Table. 
7. No real open world patrol, like Destiny's or Anthem's. This game's version of patrol is adding 1-2 tiny events into a mission, like rescue this person or defeat this unit. 
8. Combat with Iron Man is boring. His dialogues and ""humor"" is also bland and not funny, makes me want to punch myself whenever he speaks.

21,75443759,english,"Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Whatever you heard about this game before today, doesn't matter. Because most of it is old information and sometimes, straight disinformation. This is one of the best Marvel games that's come out some Ultimate Alliance. That's not hyperbole, just truth.

There is serious time and love put into this game that you won't appreciate until you play it. The style may be realistic, but the heart and soul is the comics. Actually not just the comics, but perhaps the Marvel universe as a whole.

Kamala Khan is the breakout star of this game, and truly it's HER game. And it's awesome to see. Her lines are both endearing and funny, and the way she gathers the Avengers strikes hard as a fan. She doesn't just show up and try to be a hero, she understands it like a fan. Like someone who watched the Avengers do amazing things while she grew up and now she wants to be THAT.

The gameplay is also far deeper than what trailers or the beta show. It takes a little bit to see the full power of a character as you can't put points in the third tree till Level 15. When you use all the trees together it gives you a feeling more like Diablo where each character can be tweaked for a playstyle within each build.

The Avengers Initiative is also really fun as it's a great way to do post game multiplayer. It's not just a lobby where you do matchmaking. It's an extra experience that continues post campaign, in a Destiny-ish way. But also in its own way. There's a lot of room for them add stuff so I'm looking forward to where they go with it.

23,75443678,english,"so far i'm a little disappointed in this game, i was really excited for it (especially since the Hawkeye announcement) but repeating the same four missions in multiplayer absolutely killed it for me, it's much less boring if you're playing with a friend (or group of friends) which i was but
idk, i gotta admit it's a real letdown for me. one thing i was super looking forward to were the skins, though this game has about as many skins as mortal kombat 11 if not less (4/5, not counting the recolours though there's one or two who are the exceptions) 
i can't say that the particle effects (pym particles, gamma rays, shield tech) are super noticable, sometimes you'll impact them enough and it'll show up but i've only seen it about 2 or 3 times with pym particles since they usually die beforehand (i'm playing on the maximum challenge every time, by the way) and the gear is just replaceable so i can't say that anything will stand out to you. could've been an easy fix with appearance changes (then have the option to wear a skin, could do it like Odyssey did)
the story is alright, kamala is a great character and shines so god damned hard that it should make you go pick up her run(s). bruce is another standout for me. tony was surprisingly irritating, especially in multiplayer (he was worse in the beta, dropping wisecracks every 2 seconds).
movement is usually an issue too, iron man doesn't blast his repulsors when flying (unless you're just hovering) despite doing it in the tutorial mission (A-Day) and Cap's movement is useless, genuinely. i have found about 3 times when his parkour movement has been used and it always slows me down (what's the point of swinging off of the poles when it brings you to a complete stop briefly????)

27,75443392,english,"Personally loving it, but people should be aware that it's not for everyone. After the great story campaign, the game is mostly a grind for gear and loot in rather same-y locations. I personally enjoy ARPGs and whatnot, so grinding stuff is something I like to do plenty of. If you hate repeating content, you may want to be wary. 

Also, people are experiencing severe bugs (2020-09-04). Personally had two crashes and some frame drops, but that's it. You may want to wait with your purchase in hopes that any issues you would have may be patched out.

All the heroes feel unique, their skills and abilities feel very in line with who they are. Attacks can feel a bit sluggish at times, and there are a few too many large unblockable attacks, killing of that skillful feeling you got in the Arkham titles. So it's not fully polished, but it's good. 

Some negative reviews complain about microtransactions. There are some skins and emotes you can buy, but that's it. Most skins and emotes are available by simply playing the game, and some real money-currency can be earned in-game as well. It's not presented in any intrusive way either.

My only real gripe right now is that gear doesn't feel as impactful as I would like. 

Cap is my favorite to play with but he either lacks the ability to break down the doors that everyone else can or I just haven't figured out how to do it yet, which is a real drag because it's prevented me from completing events while playing solo. I only had a handful of dips in framerate or graphical issues and everyone of them occured either during the final battle or shortly after, and none of them were game breaking, such as a floating Iron Man helmet next to the SHIELD emissary on the Chimera.

After playing for almost 4 days now, I must say this game turned out much better than I expected.

Pros :
-Each hero has cool skills and moves to master.
-Combat feels pretty good, although it takes some getting used to. ( At least on my end )
-Game looks good in general, in terms of the environments and character designs.
-The campaign is well done, well written, and it's a good length as well. Not too short, but doesn't takes days to finish.

Cons:
The cons mainly come down to the bugs and issues the game comes along with. Most recently I came across quite a few crashes which I hope will be fixed soon, plus bugs that cause you to fall through the map once you get into a mission occasionally.

In the end, this game impressed me when first playing the full release.

42,75442709,english,"Interesting take on the Avengers disbanding then reforming.  Wasn't sure if I would like the direction they were heading with the main story line but it eventually sucked me in and by the end I was fully onboard.  Each character has their own unique skill set and they all play very differently in terms of melee, ranged, mobility, etc.  Simply mashing buttons will get you downed quickly as the AI does a pretty decent job of dodging or blocking and some of the more tougher baddies have high dmg and hp thresholds.  

Graphics wise, the game is gorgeous.  It really does feel like a full on MARVEL movie when you have a power team in play.  Hulk, Thor, Iron Man, Captain America etc really have some nice effects and the pyrotechnics show is fun to watch.  Lots of people have had performance issues but I can honestly say that 21 hours in and with my older rig I have had ZERO issues.  No bugs, crashes, etc. so for me at least, the game seems well optimized.

Early on your characters feel slightly underpowered but by the time you have finished the campaign and your roster is full the heroes really start to shine.  Loot has quite a variety which enhances your play style and the skill tree customization is pretty meaty (many more options than I expected tbh).  Overall, I am quite satisfied and am enjoying the game thus far.  Fun factor is off the charts for me and it really does feel like a properly made superhero game (a genre we can all agree needs more options).

Although playing the full release was a much better experience and I am very excited about the future of this game. The skill trees in the game are way more in depth than I was expecting and all of the characters are very unique and fun to play in their own respects. The story was enjoyable and a good setup for the universe that they are trying to build. 

I haven't spent much time in the post-game yet and my first experience with multiplayer last night was a bit buggy (with enemies not spawning so not being able to clear the mission objective and progress), but with a large release like this you have to expect multiplayer hiccups at launch. I'm sure that issues like that will not be persistent. I was able to switch over to soloplay with bot companions (who are pretty decent) to finish the missions and it worked fine. I'm having a lot of fun leveling up my characters to get new powers and abilities, I only wish the gear system was not so arbitrary. They do not provide visual differences and aren't tied to the skills or abilities you get. If I unlock a new super move I'm not any stronger, but if I get an invisible chest piece my power increases by three levels, just feels weird. 

I'm hoping that the negative press about this game pre-release does not do too much harm to the game or keep players form jumping in. I did not have confidence that this would be good but I love Marvel so I bought it anyways and am having a ton of fun. This game is what I remember the Ultimate Alliance games being except it's actually fun to play, going back UA is not that fun and the new game was also a let down.

I really hope that the devs continue to work on the game and keep the promise of expanding the game over the next few years. It would be really cool to see some more heroes like the X-Men or Fantastic four join the fold.

13. whoever made the control point that size should be forced to live the rest of their life in a control point that size

14. i literally just did a mission where the AI stood there watching me, and then when i died they started fighting and didn't rez me, marvel never healed, nobody used any ally ability.

15. the character balance is so bad, there is no falloff damage from range attacks and marvel has a nearly full group heal... where other ults... are junk

16. the item variety is so bad, the only thing worth building for is GIVE ME ULT FASTER. everything else is pretty colors, shiny graphics but just... low damage.

17. get ready for the last trash mob you need to kill either falling through the world and being unkillable or going invincible. clue: they have ""reset checkpoint"" in the game. gosh, wonder why they thought that would be needed

18. matchmaking is so atrocious. half the time you can't start a game, and everyone just sits there waiting because you have no idea if it's going to load. the host sometimes loses their ""checkbox"" and has no button to start the mission, which annoys people, and then they leave, continuing the delay. IT JUST TAKES A LONG TIME

19. and then after 5 minutes of matchmaking, some of the missions literally take 1 minute to win. wut

20. matchmaking is also BROKEN if you up the difficulty, it then matchmakes for ""normal"" ... i cannot find a way to actually matchmake / play harder difficulties in multiplayer this was bug in the beta and everyone swarmed it saying ""bbbbbut its only beta!"" well here we are.

21. what is the point of the ""item vault"" ... i get too many items in a mission and then have to exit out to run to some vault just to then be able to move it to the hero?

22. crashes all the effing time, right when you're at the end of a long mission where people were wasting time

65,75441638,english,"This is gonna be broken up into a few segments, the first of which will be how the game plays and my general thoughts, and then some more things which I'll just label to make everything easier. This is the only real review I've ever done and I've ever put thought and effort into, mostly because I've been waiting for this game since the initial leaks in 2016.

CURRENT ISSUES AND CAMPAIGN: Every game has it's flaws. This games current plagues are crashing and graphical optimization issues, and some multiplayer lag and desync issues, which are big but also fixable and will be fixed in the future. Campaign is amazing, you really do feel like you're stepping into the shoes of these characters and the game also has comedy that isn't gonna make you roll around laughing but it's comedy you've seen in the movies and is a great addition by that standard. Subtitles have many typos and errors, but if you think that's a big issue you're nitpicking way too much.

GAMEPLAY: Gameplay is kind of button-mashy but as you progress you unlock new abilities as well as new and unique ways to use your old abilities. No character is really stronger in any way compared to the others, but each character does have a unique role that they can play (Ex. Iron Man and Thor can fly around and handle both enemies on top of structures, as well as flyers, while the other more hand to hand focused characters can deal with enemies on the ground. Another example is Captain America's ability to buff teammates and debuff enemies, and being able to use his shield in pretty much any situation). No matter your selected heroes, they can have chemistry and all work well together. The gameplay is simple but fun.

FUTURE: Marvel and Square Enix claim this game is going to grow and evolve for years to come, rather than them making new games and slapping on Avengers 2, Avengers 3, and so on accompanied by a $60 price tag. I hope that they stay true to this and the planned expansive and ever expanding universe comes to fruition, and we get to play as every hero in the franchise (""The Avengers project is being designed for gamers worldwide and will be packed with all the characters, environments, and iconic moments that have thrilled longtime fans of the franchise. Featuring a completely original story, it will introduce a universe gamers can play in for years to come. More details on The Avengers project and other games will be announced in 2018"". That is a quote from the initial teaser in January 2017""). With Hawkeye already on the way as a confirmed post launch DLC, and Spider-Man (A PS4 exclusive but hopefully will end up on all platforms) to join him, certainly many more characters will be revealed in the future. The game only fully released today, but I got the deluxe edition so I got 72 hour early access, that's not important other than to show that before launch they already have their eyes set on the future of this game.

CLOSING THOUGHTS: I don't do reviews, frankly I find that it's easier to just let people make up their mind on their own and just play the games I enjoy and let the people who aren't interested move on. And I still feel that way, even about this game, but I just felt like writing this review even if it's only for my friends to see and ask questions about. The campaign was great, not the longest but I love how it ends and can't wait to see how they build onto the foundation they have already placed. If you don't seem interested in the game, watch some gameplay and maybe even pick it up just to try... Steam has a refund policy, take advantage of that blessing. If you are interested but don't think it's worth $60, just wait for it to go on sale. But yeah, that's all I really have to say, and I doubt many people are even gonna read this whole thing but I had time and I'm bored so here we are. Stay safe out there everyone, and be blessed!",1599244433,1599244433,True,2,1,0.505519866943359375,0,True,False,False,76561198159442295,140,1,1655,14,1258,1600952857

67,75441600,english,"the game is alright. the game is fun at times but the issues out way the fun parts. the fun stuff is the story, the story really good that's what really keep's you going,because there actually a story with cut scenes and level's . the gameplay is alright,it's the gear or loot systems is what really hurt the combat. because basically your power level is not base on your character leveling, it's base on your gear.also game keep's crashes all the time during story level's. also the gear system is trash. the gear is not cosmetic so when you put it on your character,you don't see anything on your character. The actual marvel's skin for the character's i haven't really unlock at all after 14 hours of play.Some may say the that gear or loot should be separated.I say i disagree because the point of this hybrid live service game is to keep you coming back,and if my loot is not cosmetic? so there's no point to it or playing this game.Also there is a rumor that new characters like Black panther(RIP Chad Bosemen) that the character will be free, but there marvel's skin will be under a battlepass and you have to buy the battle pass, which basically kill's the WHOLE POINT OF PLAYING THIS GAME!!!!!! So image your a marvel fan and read the comic right and you want to play as black panther right, and you want the space black panther skin from the Intergalactic empire of wakanda story line,so i would't be able to play the game and get it. i would have to spend 60 dollars and then 10 dollars for the skin,at that point you might as well just not buy the game and just buy the 5 dollar comic instead.So last il say is this, i bought the 80 dollar verison of the game,so i had a lot of time to play the game, and to me it's not worth 80 or even 60 dollars.I am not saying the game is bad.But the bad out way the good,and this game might become a new stander in gaming so don't buy it.because another game company's might use this for the future",1599244397,1599244397,False,7,0,0.474818170070648193,0,True,False,False,76561199039876720,47,4,1771,0,897,1600475995

7,75439803,english,"10-15 hour campaign is worth a play through when it goes on sale - some quality set-piece moments and the voice actors give good performances but the game doesn't have much to offer beyond that.  Repetitive mission types that place you in the same play spaces over and over with no real meaningful loot choices don't do much to propel you to keep wanting to progress your character.  I suppose the latter stages of the end-game probably have more interesting loot but the content is not engaging enough to keep the player's interest long enough to reach that point and Crystal Dynamic's really should have included a piece of loot in the campaign that really demonstrates what end-game look looks and feels like.  

Combat encounters are probably the biggest flaw with the game - lots of visual clutter with a camera that doesn't do much to help you out in regards to spatial awareness.  The game loves to throw turrets and ranged enemies at you that slow down the pace of battles and that also inflict stuns and status conditions that disrupt your attacks.  If you can manage to evade and dispatch ranged attackers, you'll be greeted with lots of tanky minions who have shields that take some heavy hits to eventually go down.  Some points in the game it just gets exhausting even attempting these encounters - some encounters I found myself saying ""let's just move on with these battles already.""  Even when you know how to approach encounters, it doesn't quite feel as cohesive as it should - switching between ranged combat, melee combat, and flying/aerial movement is clunky when you using the more grounded abilities and combos feels more gratifying.  

Performance wasn't terrible but did have about 5 random crashes during my playtime and odd graphical bugs here and there.

Great game, great story, great combat, fairly janky loot system
worth full price IMO

As a Marvel fan I think I can say for pretty much any Marvel fan out there that is game is a dream come true.
First of all, the story: 
It's a nice take on the avengers and the inhumans. I won't go into details to avoid spoilers but the story is great and is of decent length. This is only the beginning though, as after the campaign you unlock a ton of other missions and stuff to do or work towards.
Next up; the combat:
Oh man, do I love the combat. It's not just a ""mash X or Y to win"" You have to dodge, block and parry at the right time with any of the characters to succeed in combat and make it look sick at the same time. The further you level your character, the more moves you can unlock. I love these upgrade trees; they're simple and make the combat way more fun over time, no matter your playstyle.
The leveling system is pretty good too.
There's 50 exp levels per characters and 40 hero challenge levels. Exp levels are earned by simply beating up bad guys and completing mission. You'll need these to get skill points to get more and stronger moves. Hero challenges are completed by doing daily and weekly challenges which vary per character. These let you unlock loads of cosmetic items for that specific character.
Now, there's also equipment you can find hidden in levels or that can be bought by faction gear vendors.
These will help you increase your power level as well as grant you certain buffs on certain moves.
I.E. a helmet that gives you a defensive buff after executing a power move with Captain America. I'm not gonna get into that much since this will be more relevant in the endgame, which I haven't reached yet.
The characters
They all play similar while feeling very different. Ofcourse they all have light and heavy attack combo's, but they feel very different. I.E. the Hulk feels like a tank, smashing bad guys easily with AOE attacks while Black Widow needs to dodge more often to survive combat and does sick single-target damage. There certainly is something for everyone. As of now there's 6 playable characters, but more will be available post-launch. Hawkeye will be next up and I'm stoked to see one of my favorite avengers to enter the battlefield.

I've been waiting for this game for quite a while and it is totally worth it. Can't wait for Kate Bishop and Clint Barton to release in the next couple of months.

Keep in mind, this is my personal opinion as a hack-and-slash and Marvel enthousiast.",1599242349,1599242349,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False,76561198032562264,483,6,2997,0,990,1600362267
10,75439535,english,"[h1]Pros:[/h1]
The story campaign is fun, decently written. 
The heroes all feel and play different and have decently interesting skill trees.

[h2]Cons:[/h2]
The rest of the game is an unapologetic buggy and unfinished mess. 

[b]>Performance:[/b]
Expect to crash every few missions on most PCs, sometimes the crash will hard-lock your computer and require a manual restart. 

The frame drops are all over the place and don't seem to correlate with increases or decreases in action and the same with crashing, I've crashed standing in the hub, mid-mission, loading a mission, mid-cutscene, and even at the start menu.

I initially thought it was my PC but a simple internet search will show dozens of different theories with complicated process of how to dig through in-game settings, .ini files and gpu settings as well as other stuff to band-aid things to get to a point of slightly workable(wowee, it only crashes half as much and the frame rate only tanks to 40 instead of 20!). You can also see any big streamer or Youtuber running $10k PCs experiencing the same issues left and right (some of which are laughably getting paid sponsorships to play the game, which seems like a really bad PR decision when its known across the board to have all these issues and it ends up being what you're displaying to the masses). 

Unlocked skins will randomly disappear and become re-locked, even ones you directly buy for money. As well as currency and items will randomly disappear such as the credits which are a long treadmill to unlock skins/emotes/etc.

You can frequently glitch through walls/floors, in the higher level HARM room specifically you can fall through the fall and infinitely fall and permanently brick your game till the developer finds a fix.

Speaking of which, there is no requirement for online outside of a first time connection when starting the game for the first time, however its clear based on the multiplayer aspects, the rotating missions and community challenges, that there is a heavy online focus. However saves are not cloud-saved and are completely client side, so if you lose, things bug out on a mission or get stuck somewhere, your only option is to delete it (along with any purchases or unlocks) and start over since without the cloud-saving nor online aspect there is no syncing with any servers.

[b]>Gear:[/b]
The gear was promised to give tons of build diversity and lead to deeper customization, but in practice you're always better equipping the one with higher item level and 90% of the time it just adds a randomly status effect to some attacks, changing your actual play-style isn't much of an option as most enemies fall into a rock/paper/scissor style combat where you are forced to engage them in certain ways. Sometimes gear adds an extra button that's just a buff.

The game does not have gear scaling based on held gear a'la Destiny, so the dropped gear is dropped based on the level of your equipped gear so even if you wanted to utilize the specific effects on your gear you are almost always better off just equipping the highest level piece to every slot.

[b]>Level Design:[/b]
Most of the Campaign feels fresh as you play it but about 2/3 of the way you start seeing the same areas and once you're in endgame / multiplayer you realize its the same 4 or 5 mission layouts (as well as the same exact 4 or 5 buildings) of control the point/s, kill 4 glowing things or kill the villain. 

Which brings me to my next point, there are 3 villains in the game Taskmaster and Abomination who you encountered in the beta and are in the first 20mins of the campaign and MODOK the big bad of the story, there are no other Marvel villains in any other part of the game, so you will be fighting henchmen 99% of the game and endgame, outside of villain sectors where you will fight Taskmaster or Abomination.

[b]>Gameplay:[/b]
As I've said above the skill trees and play of heroes is competent. But, the game seems to scale difficulty based on increasing projectiles, and the game has no i-frames on hard knockdowns so you can just get infinitely stun-locked very frequently. You want to pull off cool combos but you need to dodge constantly since a large portion of attacks are un-parryable, and god-forbid you get hit by an attack that causes a suppression debuff which drains you ability to dodge or sprint (as well as draining you energy to use your cool super hero abilities) leaving you open to continuing to get hard knocked downed by a barrage of projectiles.

The AI is dumb as a brick, Hulk seems to be about the only somewhat competent AI in combat the others you can frequently spot standing around while they're surrounded by action or in Ironman and Thor's case hovering in place while enemies swarm and explosions go off in their face. You also will not be able to use the AI to open any areas that require breakable walls, stealth switches or hackable terminals, sort of leaving you with Ironman as your only play option as a solo player since he can open most of them while others can only open one type of area or in Captain America's case, he can open none of them on top of moving way slower than everyone else through the sprawling maps of nothing to get to objectives.

The camera is all over the place, and you'll spend just as much time pushing buttons to fight as you will trying to whip the camera around to see what you're even doing, which won't matter because theres 10 drones and henchmen shooting projectiles from behind you and only 3 of them are indicated, but they're only indicated that is a ranged attack and not if its a single shot, slow moving projectile or barrage of gunfire, so good luck rolling the dice on your dodge timing.

[b]>Multiplayer:[/b]
The multiplayer match-making doesn't work at all.
 
Open mic is default and you need to dig into menus to enable push to talk. There is no global voice mute so you have to every missions manually mute people one by one if you wish. There is also no text chat or pinging system in the game.

[h3]Final Thoughts:[/h3]
I'm sure I've missed things in the long list of blatant problems with the game (and I'm sure people will complain about cosmetic prices and corporate sponsorship tie-ins where you need to buy their product to unlock something in game, but those don't even become an issue till all the glaring issues are fixed). 

The game itself is a good base, if all the tech issues get sorted out and there is like an year or so of content updates with new map layouts, new enemies (especially Villains, which in the Marvel Universe there's countless major and minor ones available that they chose not to put in the game for some reason leaving you feel like your a superhero janitor doing the work that SHIELD henchmen should be doing most of the game), better gearing options maybe something like unique or set items that make you feel like you got something more than a higher item level with random traits of the previous item you had and maybe some more heroes to play, then the game itself will be great.

But right now, unless you have the money to throw away on a ~10hr campaign (that you cannot replay at all by the way) and tough through crashes (that reset your mission progress back to the beginning of the mission at times no matter how close you are to finishing, even if its a cutscene post-mission) and glitches that you typically see (and expect) in amateur early access games then I cannot recommend the game in its current state.",1599242192,1599242215,False,0,0,0.455344319343566895,0,True,False,False,76561197974461518,1006,7,932,0,932,1599088451

16,75439450,english,"This review is just my opinion and is representative of my experiences. The game is fun for awhile , especially if you are a fan of Marvel. There are two types of mission ""layouts"" in this game. The first is the campaign missions which are more linear and focus on Khamala or Ms. Marvel until other characters are usable but it is linear and the missions are more focused. The second type of mission layouts are this weird mixture open world environment mixed with a shooter capture this zone or point to proceed ,  which I wasnt a fan of. It lacks the focus of the first type and the mission consist of being dumped in the open area finding the objective and completing it , whether that is defeating an enemy or capturing a point. Regardless , it comes off as lazy or rushed. 

The characters all have skill trees that can be upgraded , I believe at max level you will be able to unlock all abilities for your character of choice. The campaign takes around 10 hours somewhat and you play some missions where you are locked into a certain character. The campaign is also a prelude sort of and the real game or end game starts after the campaign. 

The combat feels alright for some characters ,there are annoyances with projectile enemies shooting you from off screen so you will need to get in a habit moving your camera around during combat to be aware of all enemies. Some characters can parry but all characters can dodge. 

There are some technical issues that I notice are a problem which are frame rate drops , and the game crashed a lot for me.  Currently I have around 25 hours of game play ad the game has crashed on me around between 10-15 times. 

Hopefully this helps , I wont go into any further details as everyone is different and there may be a difference of opinions on some things. Like all games , when they are played with friends , one can easily overlook the flaws of the game.

It is great actually seeing muscle fibers flex in Hulk's neck and chest as he performs animations.  Voice acting is incredible!  Lookin at you Kamala!!!  It is very believable and I really feel the emotions that Kamala (above all others) feel when she is going through her character development.  Music and sounds are alright.  Not great.  The fact that Cap's shield sounds like a trash can lid is very disturbing.

Things I don't like: The combat feels very ... clunky at times.  Dodging doesn't always put you at and advantage and alot of times the things that you need dodge you wouldn't need to block.  It is pretty easy to get cornered or stun-locked in the sense that an enemy action can put you on the ground, and the animation it takes to get back up is long so you're getting pummeled with other things that put you on the ground until you die.  Annoying!  The war table makes the game feel disjointed.  Sometimes I just want to go back to the Chimera between missions, but I'm stuck on the Quinjet.  Not exactly my idea of a smooth transition.  Especially when said quinjet is in San Francisco but I want to do a HARM room challenge when the Chimera is in Utah.  Just feels weird.  Enemies spawn under ground as well making it a huge progress blocker.

36,75439010,english,"An amazing campaign and solid fun core gameplay make Marvel's Avengers a competent super hero game.

What kind of game is it?

An archetypal super hero game that falls somewhere between third person arcade beat em up and Destiny game play loop. Controls very similar to Batman Arkham and Spider-Man PS4 games which has become the standard for many of the best super hero games of the modern day.

Pros:
+ Excellent acting, facial capture, and original story-line that does for Avengers what Arkham and Spider-Man PS4 did for those IP's.
+ Fantastic interpretations of the character playstyles, allowing the player to play each unique hero in a variety of effective ways to feel comfortable while still delivering the dopamine high of using iconic moves and abilities.
+ Sound effects are amazing, and like the hiss of a lightsaber or the ""boing"" of Mario's jump, the sound catch on and become infinitely imbedded in the experience.
+ Combat is impactful, fun to watch, and the core loop of combat gameplay is excessively enjoyable to approach in different ways each time.
+ Kamala Khan is a wonderful protagonist, and is a standout performance even alongside the other main Avengers, who are voiced by some of the best name voice actors out there.
+ In a nutshell, the game is a perfect destress tool on easier difficulties, and makes you feel like a badass on higher ones. Highly customizable experience and tons of replayability.

Cons:
- Some framerate hitches when all four characters are doing something crazy or a metric ton of enemies hog the field.
- Music is kind of forgettable.
- For me, I have had near consistent issues with matchmaking, from matches not starting, to taking super long to find players, to starting with no one and having less than 4 heroes in play for the mission.
- Seems like there are too few bosses.
- Dodge indicators aren't consistent, and many enemy types have unique attacks that need to be timed properly, which the indicators do not account for, leading to some frustrating damage taking.
- A lot of rooms in the multiplayer missions feel too similar to each other.

Verdict: 8/10

Far from the best super hero game, but a loveable main character, excellent story, addictive gameplay, and tons of unlockables and challenges, with the promise of more to come for many years, make Marvel's Avengers a must play for any super hero fan, or anyone who wishes Destiny or Diablo was a super hero game.",1599241545,1599241545,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198040314984,785,13,1304,83,845,1601849309

Kamala Kahn's Ms. Marvel is fun protagonist. Shes a humble and refreshing character who's plays well into the story. Each Avenger's power set feels fleshed out, combat is less button-mash and more timed light/heavy combos and defensive strategy, much like Jedi: Fallen Order. The gear system is more-or-less just stats, without having any real visual impact otherwise. Story is pretty good though, the dialogue isn't cringe-worthy either. I'm entertained by the gameplay and story, and invested in it. On Brutal Difficulty, you're a superhero but not invincible. Even when playing The Hulk, I cant just run in and get crowded too quickly.

Pros:

1) The bad stuttering that was in the beta has been fixed. I was running the game on medium with bad stuttering in the demo, and now I'm on max with 0 stutters in the full release. They optimized it.

2) I am enjoying the story so far. The beta basically gave you the intro mission, then skipped maybe 30 minutes of content, then had that Hulk mission. Seeing that in-between content filled in a few gaps, and the story, so far, is really nice.

3) I have not done public co-op (I never pub), so I can't comment on the co-op aspect. I will edit this review once I play with my friends.

Cons:

1) When you tun on subtitles, it turns on closed captions as well. So you get '[Iron man charges his unibeam.]' in the cinematics.  Or '[Hulk leaps into battle.]' or '[Kamala rummages on the desk]' or '[Explosion in the distance]'. Things that are obviously happening on screen. Even if closed captions are OFF, they are on.
It's silly that Closed Captions can be OFF and still be on because Subtitles are on, and it might be annoying to some. I had hoped that would have been fixed between the beta & release.

Let me begin by saying, that this game imo is great, enjoyable and I love everything about it. The dynamics of different characters, how different abilities work for different situations and it's just a lot of fun. As you can see, i've only put ion 11.5hours and i'm still doing campaign missions, imagine that.. majority of players completed it in less than 10 hours but there's so much to explore in this game I love it. The level designs and mission designs have beyond exceeded my expectations. Tell you the truth, my initial thought when they first showed some gameplay, I was like oh boy this is going to be bad, but turns out, they put in the work and it feels and plays so much better than initially shown, I can't wait for future content and I believe that this game is going to have a very long life as long as they keep supporting it, content updates, patches and etc.. especially making the looting experience worth while.

Does this game have performance issues? Yes, i'm running an RTX 2080, I7-8700k 16GB Ram and 1440p resolution. My settings should be on very high - ultra but at the moment they are not due to poor optimization. Do i believe they will fix it?Yes i do, and i hope we see some nvidia game ready drivers too. Additionally, with the new patch they included Steam Cloud save, which is amazing news! 

Overall, i def. recommend this game alone for the campaign. I have not touched multiplayer but I love what they did. The campaign alone is wroth anywhere between $40-50 (USD). That's just my opinion, others might think differently for sure.

62,75438397,english,"I really enjoy the game play of most heroes and the actual campaign mode was an awesome experience that I hope is continually built upon with the release of new heroes and events.  I have not tried multiplayer so I will not speak on that aspect but will say I appreciate the fact I can take AI companions into battle instead of other players if I wish.

Although I was not a fan of every heroes combat abilities I looked at that as more of a positive than a negative.  I realize some people will dislike the aspects of characters I enjoy and like the parts I don't.  I appreciate that there are characters to fit a variety of play styles and I have not even begun to get into the mastery portion of any character at current. 

With all of the outcry over micro-transactions in this game I have yet to feel like any purchase is pushed, even slightly.  It took me more time than I would like to admit to even find the marketplace and even then I thought the cosmetics available in the free battle passes were far superior to any of the current offerings.  I was also surprised at the amount of free micro-transaction credit you get (1300 creds) within each battle pass, of which there is one for each character.  Out of all the paid games with micro-transactions I have played, which is too many, this one pushes them the least and the amount of emphasis Youtube personalities have put on this part of the game did initially turn me off.  I am glad I decided to try it out for myself.

64,75438226,english,"I've just finished the Assemble's campaign on my PS4; playing this PC version is my next experience. These are my conclusions so far:

POST-BETA

The developers have fixed several bugs present in the Beta, although there are still some things that they should review as part of the upcoming updates. There are no significant changes in regards to the graphics.

Square-Enix support has come back to my messages, and confirmed that they forwarded my feedback to the relevant team to address the new bugs and suggestions that I have found so far. Let's see if they fix them all!

STORY MODE

It's a quite interesting and original storyline, totalling 20 chapters that you can extend with another 27 chapters of HARM trainings, War Zones and Drop Zones, that allows extending the story due to it helps getting better gear and levelling up.

The new HARM tutorials for each one of the Avengers help you to get familiar with them and to improve your knowledge of the primary skills and how to push them to the limits. Sadly, these tutorials are available after you have already played with that Avenger, so it seems useless at that point.

There are also weekly challenges for the whole community of players, so it encourages you to keep playing aiming to get prizes at the end of the week.

However, the main problem is that I can't see how I can re-play any chapter of the main story with any character or at least taking advantage of the new skills. It's also a problem because I didn't get all the collectables, and now I don't know how I can get them all.

THE AVENGERS

Six Avengers on the release date: Ms Marvel, Hulk, Iron Man, Black Widow, Thor and Captain America. More Avengers will be included in the game as part of the upcoming updates.

The skills for each one of the six Avengers are unique. There are more skills for all of them, but also there aren't significant changes compared with the Beta due to it included the most important ones. The main point now is that there's no limit to Level 15, so your characters can keep improving and learning new attacks.

Each one of them has their style in regards to attacks, defence and skills, and it allows you to have different experiences, so when not playing the story mode is up to you which Avenger you want to play and master, depending on your game style.

GRAPHICS

I couldn't see a significant improvement compared with the Beta. I hope that the upcoming updates will include new Avengers, new missions but also better graphics. Knowing that we're now in September 2020, I expect better graphics, especially for a game like this.

SOUND

Nice to see there are several translations available, that opens the game to a broader market. Still, several dialogues are not translated (at least for the Spanish version), especially at the end of the storyline. There are also a few times where you can see the character ""talking"", but there's no audio at all.

I found myself with audio bugs a couple of times, where I could hear just some environment sounds, but I couldn't hear anything else. So, it was harder to keep fighting on because I couldn't hear when the enemies were attacking me.

Thanks to the subtitles I could follow the story, mostly when the audio issues were present, but I also noticed the subtitles are horrible most of the times due to they don't match with the dialogues most of the times.

DELUXE VERSION

It just brings a few additional in-game items such as a unique armour for each Avenger and also a nameplate that sets the same logo that each Avenger has. It's nice to have them, but I ended playing most of the time with the armours that each character gets as part of the storyline.

CONCLUSION

This game brings an exciting and original story, with a new view of what an Avengers game can be. My impression is that the whole storyline is short, compared with other games (but I probably compare it with Marvel's Spider-man released exclusively for PS4, due to is a Marvel game too).

I would recommend the game if you are an Avengers fan and want to play it (like me). Otherwise, maybe it is worth to wait for a few months so the developers can fix the known issues, including new content, and perhaps save some money too thanks to the Steam sales.

65,75435989,english,"Really loving this game so far from early access! It's more than I could've ever hoped for, and I was VERY meh on the game until the first or second War Table or beta. Being Iron Man is just the best, though every hero feels fun and very distinct from one another in their own way. 

The story is surprisingly compelling and the characters feel... like the characters I know and love, just different. The voice actors really sold the performance in a way I didn't think anyone but the MCU actors could. It's really hard to make my mind accept anyone else as Iron Man, but Nolan, Troy, and the rest knocked these characters out of the park! Great dialogue and unexpected interactions between the cast. 

The game has actual set pieces! I'm stunned. Crystal Dynamics really did an amazing job... oh and it it looks piping gorgeous! Maximum destruction settings for VFX settings FTW! 

Just please give us a way to replay the AMAZING campaign missions again without replaying the entire thing. We should be able to still earn loot too. At least let me get screenshots and collectables :D 

The campaign is seriously worth it by itself. I haven't got to the end game yet, and, honestly, right now, it's all been so good, that it wouldn't matter if it all ended after the campaign. That said, the combat is so fun, and the visuals so good, the enemies so varied, and heroes so powerful, that I am very glad I can keep hitting combat scenarios with them and unlocking cool outfits, finishing moves, and emotes. 

On the topic of cosmetics and the cash shop -- You can get like 70-bucks-plus in premium credits from just playing as the launch heroes, which is more than enough to buy whatever cosmetics you might want that are only in the shop plus have credits left over for the post-launch heroes. It doesn't feel cheap or unfair once you understand how much content is already in the game and how much they're intending to add. Very little content is pay-walled off, and, again, you get tons of premium credits by just playing the game to buy the few cash-shop items.

75,75437879,english,"I got the Deluxe Edition of the Game so I got to play it 3 days early and I can say the Story is really good at some points but the multiplayer Missions after you beat the game are kind of Lackluster and really need some improvement.  The side missions outside the main story don't feel attached to the story at all minus the AIM characters and that's why they don't feel worth doing other than for leveling up your character.  The side missions outside the story should've had more cutscenes and tied into the story more with MODOK's reactions of the Avengers destroying his facilities and it should've affected public opinion on the Daily Bugle Brodcast station in the Chimera.

Also little gameplay tip:  You can level up your characters really fast by doing the 10 wave HARM Room mission in the Avengers Initiative section of the game repeatedly on the Easiest difficulty and also Difficulty doesn't matter in this game when it comes to leveling up your Character, higher difficulty only affects what kind of Loot/Gear you earn such as common and Rare on Easy but you can get legendary Gear on the Hardest Difficulty. Also the only Way to level up the challenge Card system in the Game is to complete the daily and weekly challenges which is a long Grind especially if you want that level 23 classic Captain America Suit at the end of his Challenge Card or you can take the easy way out and spend $100.00 dollars on 10,000 credits to skip levels in the Challenge card system which I do not think is worth it

Also I'd like the developers to not use Kamala Khan as the main character in every story update I liked her character I just think they should change to a different Avenger depending on who the main villain of the story is in the story update.  Example if Red Skull is the main Villain make Captain America the main character, or if Ultron is the main villain make Tony or Hank Pym the main character depending on if they go the comic or MCU route I'm just saying Kamala doesn't need to be the main character everytime but that they should switch it up between the other Avengers so it doesn't get stale.",1599240155,1599240359,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198171748302,221,2,3072,0,1010,1599787274

77,75437992,english,"So far a great game. If you are a fan of Marvel and the Avengers, you're probably going to like this game. Each character feels like they bring something to the team whether you're bashing away things as Hulk or Ninja take-down things with Black Widow. The campaign is a great story, Multiplayer is fun and better if you have friends to join you.

So I know some people have some contention with the Marketplace Game store. Let me be clear all it has are cosmetics in it (Skins, Nameplates, Emotes, and Take-down animations). A lot of this kind of stuff can be unlocked by doing the Hero challenge cards, by looting, by completing missions, and by playing the campaign (although it may not be the same stuff in the store). It is completely optional so you don't even have to touch it if you so choose. If you do decide to purchase currency to make purchase from the marketplace, it has been stated that this will help keep the future dlc content free. Personally I don't mind this myself. 

Game feels pretty solid so far (I know flying took me a second to get use to but it is tons of fun once you adjust for it). One thing I do wish the game had was a way for me point out things in multiplayer (i.e. like chests) so I don't have to wait on my friend to come to me to get the loot (I didn't find a command for it but if I missed it I'll edit this).

They just came out with a patch to address some stability issues. So far the main concern has been the connectivity for multiplayer but reading the patch notes they seem to be well aware and addressing the issue. Other than some minor glitches I found that weren't really bad (i.e. enemy stuck in wall and needed to be kill to move on, I just left the vicinity and it completed so all good) I've hadn't had too much issue with the game.
 
I feel like the controller is the best way to go on this game but the keyboard and mouse controls aren't bad either so its kinda of a personal preference here (Don't really need too much precision like the mouse and keyboard will give you).

Playing around with the graphic settings I can run it on the highest settings and the game looks beautiful. On the lowest settings, though noticeable, the game still looks good so if you have only the minimum requirements to run the game it still looks like a polished game. 

All in all I am enjoying this game very much. I'm glad that the developers are asking for feedback and making adjustments to the game to make it better. It definitely has secured my recommendation.",1599240291,1599240291,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198027282060,163,9,4241,0,1350,1600572916

The campaign story itself was surprisingly good, but it felt a little bit too fast paced at times. It did a decent job of giving every Avenger the spotlight. There were a lot of people (myself included) who didn't want Ms Marvel to dominate every scene and detract from the story. They managed this well, I wasn't forced to really play her any more than the others. I even wanted to go out of my way to play her by the end because I hadn't so much early on. She grew on me despite my initial stance against her.
 
Multiplayer was available from the start for everyone who didn't want to do the campaign. It openly warns you there will be campaign spoilers if you do this first. Nice and accessible for the guys who just wanted MP.
Matchmaking isn't fast right now, I'll put that down to only the pre-order deluxe buyer playing at the time this was written but worth checking later. 

The characters felt good for the most part. Cap felt like a super soldier, Thor felt like a god etc. You do have to level them up a bit to get to this point mind you, but that's the whole point of a progression system. Hulk needs work though. Personally, I felt his big issue was he was easily staggered during his heavy attacks which is where most of his damage is. They all play differently too as some are better at ranged, some at CQC etc. But you CAN push any character any direction if you want and still be okay. 

Gameplay has a touch of repetition to it, not uncommon in any game but I quickly found myself using the same combos. I had to make myself try different things sometimes. The levels begin to get quite familiar too, not ideal but this is supposed to be a long-term story. Should mean new level designs later but right now it's a bit underwhelming. 

Performance is again still an issue, although it does appear improved since the beta. There is a patch coming soon so fingers crossed. It wasn't bad enough to ruin the gameplay but I more than meet the recommended specs. If you're a bit further down, I'd recommend holding fire until performance is better. 

The gear system is forgettable. Aside from legendaries, gear doesn't have a huge impact on your playstyle. It's just a system of getting higher numbers so you can do more damage and resist more damage. I guess it makes getting the legendaries much more rewarding, but I feel this isn't a strong point of the game at all. 

Cosmetics are handled well enough. Some are locked behind payed currency, but quite a few are actually available at in-game vendors for currency you obtain from missions. Plus you can find ""patterns"" that you can then scan and unlock a random outfit for any character. I don't know if that means you can unlock payed cosmetics from this, I doubt it. Nevertheless I think the issues people had with this system are largely overreacted, it seems to reward players for their time well enough. 

I'd recommend this game, especially if you like the Avengers. It has issues, some will be fixed (performance), some might be fixed (repetition) and some probably won't be (gear). Despite this, the story is good, the MP is good when you find a match, the character largely work great and feel like your favourite hero. I said it in my beta review, this ain't a GOTY but it isn't the unholy trinity of games either. It'll scratch that avengers itch for a while and you'll probably come back to it every new DLC.

While there are technical issues, marketplace pricing concerns, and some gameplay improvements to be made, there is a really solid foundation here for a genuinely good Marvel game. If you were a fan of Marvel Heroes I definitely recommend giving it a try. 

I resolved most framerate slowdowns by setting the game to ""Prefer Maximum Performance"" in Nvidia Control Panel, but optimization can still be improved. FoV is a big concern, the camera is way too close most of the time, hopefully that will be addressed. Dodging responsiveness can also be improved, I feel like sometimes I get animation locked while fighting loads of enemies on screen. Marketplace pricing is through the roof for a game we're buying though, $12 for a takedown animation and $10 for an emote? Not to mention $14 for the legendary costumes. It is just too much.

As for the good, the heroes feel extremely good. You can feel that they put time and effort into making them feel as different and satisfying as possible. The story is nothing to write home about but it is a decent Marvel story and feels like a movie, especially the final mission. They left a lot of hanging threads that they can explore in upcoming story drops for different characters and such which is exciting. 

Overall it is a recommend from me since I've been having a lot of fun with it and the progression is nice.

87,75437640,english,"Ok, I played the beta for like 15 minutes, and it crashed. I did not intend to buy this Game.
A good friend of mine and I talked a lot about it and I was very skeptical. I spontaneously decided to buy the game to, you know, give it a try and to play together with him (which honestly was the main reason). 

I was not disappointed, in fact I got very positive thoughts and feelings about MA.

Graphics are great, and compared to the performance of the beta its light years better. I actually did not think they could pull off such improvements. Yes, still some issues and crashes, but it looks good and I´m above 60 fps with a 1080TI.

They listened to player feedback from what I can tell, and I hope they will continue to listen. Specifically for QoL changes... 
C´mon why do I need to cross the WHOLE ship to get to this freaking faction vendor and move with the speed of a turtle?

Positive stuff:
-Great Campaign, great acting and the plot was fine with me. I enjoyed playing it a lot. Took me 14h to get through.
-Combat seems to be super super easy, but it's not, actually you can make some insane combos once you stop smashing buttons. It's not like ultra crazy complicated, but you get used to it.
-Heroes: They are all awesome, and they play different and somewhat similar, I really love Black Widow so far!
-Graphics: It just looks really good! I`m looking forward to more improvements!
-Multiplayer: It's a little odd to kind of have two games melted together, in a strange way, but we did not have any BIG issues so far playing together.
-Micro Transaction: To be fair, I thought this will be a $$ grap title for sure, but once you understand the whole store concept it's actually pretty fair. I already bought an awesome IronMan Skin for the currency which I got by just playing the game. All the stuff you can buy is only cosmetics, and you get great looking stuff automatically. Hopefully it will stay like this.

neutral
-UI: well it's a console driven UI, Its ok, but some things are just odd and I´m looking forward to some QoL improvements.
-Hero specific Missions: I actually thought they are a little bit more, but see for yourself and there is room for improvement.

Negative:
-Multiplayer: ;) Yes, if your game crashes you can start all over, because the mission is not rejoinable.
-Replay-ability: The party used for the maps are heavily reused, I would really like to see a randomiser and more scenery 
-iFrames/combat flow: Sometimes the block timing feels odd, and just does not work. I think this can be improved over time and as the devs get more data
-Random Stuff: Jarvis, please talk less. I want all vendor dudes in one place. More transparency about XP gain / need etc.

I actually really enjoyed my time with MA so far, and I was positively hyped instead of hyped to death and then disappointed.

Step into a cinematic journey of discovery and adventure that captures the heart of each Avenger you know and love, and introduces one that maybe you don't know all that well. Reassemble Earth's Mightiest Heroes from the four corners of the planet and take the helm as they re-learn what it is to be a hero. I have only played the campaign and few side missions for purposes of leveling characters, but the story does not disappoint, with excellent mocap, stellar voice performances from Nolan North et al., and a plot that keeps you engaged all the way through. 

Gameplay wise, it plays a bit like the Marvel Ultimate Alliance series, but without the limiting top-down perspective that forces players to stay close to each other. This game allows you to fly solo (literally, with Iron Man and Thor) or team up online (though I haven't yet tried matchmaking) to combine power or split up and multitask. With the large open-world arenas you're thrown into, you'll find yourself on the wrong side of AIM's worst of the worst. At times, it is much easier to get overwhelmed by the sheer number of enemies than I would like. The Hulk and Thor in particular should be able to shrug off certain attacks like the bite of a flea, especially from peon enemies that can occasionally interrupt your combos. 

The combat system itself is a bit like Arkham's Freeflow--easy to use, difficult to master. From counter abilities that can knock multiple enemies to the ground to the innate buffs unique to each character that will turn the tide in a critical moment of battle, every tool in your arsenal is important. Some are inherently better suited to certain tasks--flyers for taking out dropships, tanks for taunting and eliminating clusters of enemies, fighters to hammer strong single opponents--but all are useful and bring unique playstyles to the table.

There are some notable bugs to mention. Namely, the audio cuts out during certain gameplay moments or cinematics. I played without subtitles the whole way through the campaign, and it wasn't until one stuttery section of the finale that I had to turn them on so I could read what wasn't being played. The game also crashed a handful of times, and I'm working with a pretty decent rig (GeForce RTX 2080), but I also played for about 12-14 consecutive hours when deluxe play became available, so it might just have been my computer telling me to sleep. The connection issues from the first day have already been patched as far as I can tell, though I haven't even touched the multiplayer so I'm not sure how it works practically.

Good thing is, this game is here to stay for years to come and I hope they can fix the issues I have with the multiplayer. The main issue is, the maps are just so generic and same-looking. It's the same corridor after corridor, same assets with different layout variations. But that's something they can most definitely fix in the future and I have a feeling as the game ages, the environments and level design will become more varied.

As for my hero complaints... I have to mention I HATE that I can't jump very high as the Hulk in the big open spaces. I HOPE they add an update that allows us to jump higher as Hulk, at least double his current max jump height, just like the Ultimate Destruction game... Keep the rhythm based system in where you time each jump press to gain more height/distance. Could be really cool.

16,75436685,english,"TL;DR - It's a good game, but its not without its flaws.  I recommend it, but go in with your eyes open, and hope the future of the game pans out. 

The good

It's a fun game. The combat was supposedly handled by the guy who did God of War's combat. You can see its influence pretty strongly. The fights are more hectic though, as the expectation is that there will be up to 4 people fighting. There are six heroes at launch and they play pretty differently from one another, which is great. The skill trees add to the depth and allow you to customize to fit your play style. The campaign is medium length, you'll probably finish it in about 14 hours give or take a few. It's pretty enjoyable, if you like Marvel stuff. The campaign isn't the only thing to do, once you finish it, you'll unlock a new missions to level your heroes, get new equipment, and find more collectibles. 

The bad

Performance has improved considerably since the beta, with many reporting minimal issues, but the game ain't perfect. There are still bugs, crashes, and the like. That being said, it seems really random which set ups have trouble. I think the only way to tell how it will run, is to try it yourself. The campaign is over relatively quickly, but the end game is clearly designed around a time sink. If you are used to blitzing to the end of things, it'll probably be a frustrating grind. 

The misunderstood

The monetization in the game is not as bad as some people are making out. Don't get me wrong, the prices for some of the mtx, especially the skins, are a little wild for game we already had to buy. The battlepasses on the hand are much better  with the first six heroes battlepasses being free. More importantly, unlike battlepasses in other titles there is no time limit. There is no rush to finish a heroes battlepass before the end of a season lest you miss out on content. On the other hand, it will take a long time to finish each battlepass. Finally, there are no abusive lootbox practices. No lootboxes at all. 

The future
If the devs make good on their promises for future content, I suspect this will be the best multiplayer Marvel game we've had in a while. We'll be getting new heroes, missions, raids, and other assorted things frequently.

the game has absolutely terrible performance, constant heavy stutters and freezes. Only way I was able to play at all was to set everything to lowest settings, turning off every possible feature and I could game for about an hour at a time. After that it seemed to go into memory leak and the stutters and freezes re-appeared.
From what I could play however I did enjoy the story and there is definitely a lot they can build on with future updates. The game is like a mix of destiny and anthem, in terms of ""open"" world and mission build up. You go from hub to hub, start missions from your base while leveling up and unlocking skills for your characters.
Soon you realise though that the gear you find is all the same with: 
1)x combo does x amount of more damage, 
2)ranged attacks deal x elemental damage and 
3)get a buff from x attack chain
Nothing enhances your actual skills, kind of the same problem another game had I might have mentioned.

62,75435376,english,"If you are a fan of Borderlands, Destiny, Warframe or any of the co-op class based shooters, you owe it to yourself to try this game out. The story, while short, is leagues better than anything on offer from the games mentioned: Kamala Khan (Ms. Marvel) is an incredible character that grounds the campaign, which isn't that  long if you only play the campaign and none of the Iconic Missions (individual story lines for each hero). 

As great as the campaign is, it is once you get into that post-game grind where the game really starts to tick off all the right Looter Shooter boxes. Playing multiplayer with a full team running around the three larger environments or fighting room to room in an AIM base is spectacular fun with a group of people. The performance can get a little dicey when things are exploding all around you in a glorious mess of abilities, but with the right tweaks it's not hard to keep 60 frames.

This isn't to say the game is flawless. There are a number of technical issues (crashes to desktop, multiplayer matchmaking taking an ungodly amount of time, load times for some of the larger maps) but I imagine these are all things that pop out in large scale player use and will be fixed shortly. Despite all that, at the end of the day, this is a good co-op game that has limitless potential in terms of content delivery.

68,75433589,english,"[b]The Good:[/b] The graphics are gorgeous. The combat is fun enough to keep me engaged and each character feels unique and fun to play. It's fun to smash things as the Hulk, fly around and blast things as Iron Man and beat people up with stretchy arms and legs as Ms. Marvel. There are plenty of missions and quests to take part in, so lack of content doesn't seem to be a problem thus far. Also, despite what you may have heard monetization isn't as bad as everyone is making it out to be... provided you have some patience. [i]Marvel's Avengers[/i] has a battle pass system (called Challenge Cards). Each of the 6... let's call them OG Avengers has a free battle pass that will award you with credits. These credits can be used to purchase premium battle passes that (If I'm understanding correctly) will come with whatever new characters will come at a later date. So, in theory if you have the patience to grind out the battle passes you never have to spend any money if you don't want to. Also, unlike some other games with battle passes these never expire or rotate so you can take as long as you want to complete them. Would I rather have no battle passes and just get all of the cosmetics for free right out of the gate? Yes. Is this system as bad as most Youtubers are making it out to be? No.  Also, all of the missions that I've played so far allow for AI companions, so if you want to play this game entirely solo you can (to the best of my knowledge).

[b]The Bad:[/b] Spider-Man is a Playstation exclusive. I don't think I need to explain why that's bad. Kamala Khan is just flat out annoying. As much as I love her powers and kit, I just can't stand her personality. I wish Crystal Dynamic had chosen any other character to be the main character of this game. If they wanted a young, new superhero why not use Miles Morales? Yeah, he's Spider-Man but he's not Peter Parker, so I doubt Sony could complain too much about his inclusion in non-Playstation versions of the game. Though to be fair, Sony doesn't have the rights to video game or comic book versions of Spider-Man.(Look it up if you don't believe me.) While, the graphics and character models are good, it's clear that Crystal Dynamic/Square Enix is trying so hard to make these character models look like the MCU actors and actresses without actual having to use their likenesses. Which leads to this weird disconnect where you know Banner is supposed to be Mark Ruffalo but isn't. Cap is supposed to be Chris Evans but isn't, etc. Also, while I enjoy the combat, the timing for perfect dodges and parries seem to be a little iffy. Sometimes I can dodge and parry with easy, other times it feels like I'm getting hit even though I pressed the dodge or parry button. This is especially noticeable on Hulk. I don't know if each character has their own unique dodge/parry timer but it feels like Hulk is the hardest one to get right. Speaking of Hulk he feels very weak at least at low levels. He just doesn't seem to do much damage nor can he tank a bunch of hits. Despite the fact that I defended the battle pass system as being relatively fair, the prices of individual cosmetic items in the in game shop are ridiculous and should be lowered in my opinion. Oh yeah, before I forget, the camera in this game is pretty terrible. Even at the most zoomed out distance the camera feels claustrophobically close to your character making it difficult to tell what's going on at times. You'll often find yourself getting hit by attacks from off screen because the camera simply won't let you see what's happening. 

[b]The Ugly:[/b] Did I mention that Spider-man is a Playstation exclusive? The performance and optimization of this game is just atrocious. Here are my specs:

R9-3900X
RTX 2070 Super
16GB 3600mHz
 
With these specs I have to turn down the settings to Low to get a playable framerate at 1440p. Anything above low will result in regular drops in framerate down to single digit numbers for prolonged periods of time. The framerate at low is so unstable one minute I'll be getting over 100 fps and then it'll drop below 50 fps the next. So far in the day that I've been playing this game I've had 2 crashes. One crash direct to desktop and one that froze the game so hard that I had to force close the game. I've read reports on the discussion page of people losing progress because of corrupted save files. That's right an always online live service game has local save files. So expect cheaters to find away to manipulate game files sooner rather than later. Apparently, Update: Steam Cloud saves were added today (September 4, 2020) right before launch, so disgrard everything I said about local files. Also, there seems to be a memory leak that will cause framerates to drop to unplayable levels after a few hours regardless of graphics settings requiring a restart of the game to fix.

[b]Final Verdict:[/b] I am enjoying this game and at it's core this game is fun. However, I cannot in good conscience recommend this game until: 

1) Spider-Man is in the PC version.

2) The many technical issues this game has are fixed.

71,75435087,english,"TL;DR: Game has an amazing narrative better than some of the MCU movies, with in-depth and addicting combat and RPG elements that make the game re-playable for hours to come. With only minor bugs and some needed improvement in optimization, the game is worth the price especially with friends!

Having 30 hours in the first couple days I have to say this game is all I've ever wanted from a Marvel Game:

The combat being fun and extremely in-depth when it comes to leveling up your skills trees and combining those elements with the gear you have on to make your superhero feel stronger and more god-like as you progress through a series of different gamemode types. Each character feels like they could star in there own triple-A game when leveled up to the max.

The campaign is surprisingly well written and well casted. The story is intriguing with many references and easter eggs to all types of Marvel content along with great visuals, strong narrative, and magnetic characters to feel attached too. The campaign has something for everyone and is absolutely hilarious.

The game has a lot after the campaign too, including end-game content and mission types that will keep your team struggling for the best legendary and exotic loot in the game to truly complete your characters. Not to mention faction based missions and daily quests/boss fights. Personally I haven't felt the ""heavy bugs"" of this game and have been fortunate to have almost no crashes, no game-breaking situations or even any multiplayer problems, but I believe there are some issues with that soon to be fixed.

The game could work on some things like optimization still, which the developers said they're making a constant effort to improve, also some quality of life changes when it comes to menu and certain areas of the HUB.

The Campaign is very endearing and has some nice little side things for you to do. I would prefer a little bit more variation of going here and beating up x y and z robots. Perhaps future updates can add more disaster relief style missions where you have to save civilians? Hero stuff you know. 

Also I appreciate that the scope of the game necessitates that we will see future villain fodder show up, but the current cast of bosses aren't that inspiring. Really need some of the marvel goon squad gallery to start appearing and just being general menaces.

93,75434134,english,"After 3 days of testing due to the Deluxe edition, I try to talk about the most important points.

First of all, I recommend the game in the current state. I have no technical issues at all so far.

Graphics, especially with the HD package installed, are beautiful to look at and the cinematics which help telling the story are great as well.

I need to split the sound into two separate opinions, because I think the music and the SFX are really nice but some voice actors could’ve been chosen better. Most of all, Tony Stark, he sounds too young in the German version, therefore I switched to English. Not perfect either, but much better.

Let’s talk about the battle passes.
Yes they are there! And yes this is a full price game.
BUT!
Honestly and personally, I don’t care. There are 6 heroes at launch, and each of these 6 heroes have their own battle passes directly at launch. And the premium pass is activated at no cost, they are free.
Each pass grants 1300 currency when fully levelled, granting you 7800 currency from the free passes at launch.
Future passes have been announced to cost 1000, and grant 1300 as well.
So yeah, battle passes are included in this game, but if you are patient and don’t wanna spend money, then you can get EVERYTHING from the passes without spending a dime, and you can also save the 300 extra to buy other things in the shop as well.
So as far as I am concerned, i will buy everything „for free“ since I will collect the currency from the free passes and work with that.

Also: ALL future Story DLCs will be for FREE! So I get why they need to get some money otherwise to make it work for longer.

Story:
I don’t have finished the campaign by now, but I really like it, and like I told above the cinematics are doing a fine job storytelling.

So yes, i recommend!

I expected to skip every cutscene after being very unimpressed with the story when I played pre-launch, but I'm happy that I didn't. 
Story is much better than I expected, and Ms Marvel, and her interactions with the core Avengers team is the reason. 
I also enjoyed the fact that they managed to turn what is basically a marvel slapstick & comic relief villain into something believable.

4. Diverse maps, ranging from wastelands to snowy mountains.
5. Multiplayer's fun when you play challenging missions.
6. Boss fights are also fun but there aren't a lot of them.
7. Fanservice that references comics, and they are somewhat frequent.

Cons :
1. The sidequests are fun, but there aren't a lot of them.
2. Not a lot of game-breaking bugs, but there are some bugs that are annoying, for example locking some cosmetics that you've already unlocked
3. Battlepass progression takes wayyyy too long, as there are only 4 challenges that allow you to get points daily.
4. PC version seems to suffer from less crashes and freezes compared to consoles, but the optimization in the game could be done better.
5. Enemy types are really diverse, but the faction types are not. Currently, there are only two enemy factions.
6. Endgame currency takes a bit too long to get.
7. Once you unlock all skills for a character, it's just gear and cosmetics grinding.

32,75433647,english,"Marvel Avengers is an ambitious game that was designed around a live-service game. Similarly, to Destiny 2, the real fun is the endgame AND Multiplayer. Firstly, this is not a story-driven game, the story itself is around 12-20+ hours depending on your playstyle. It’s an original story made by CD where the main character Kamala tries to get the help of the Avengers to take down the villain of the story. With the story, there are a ton of side missions that come as you complete it. Each hero also has their own story quest/questline. Multiplayer has multiple difficulties and you’re able to play with 4 in a party, with a lot of quests to go with it. Multiplayer isn’t something that’s required as you can bring along companions of your own for said quests. As for internet connection, this is a game you can play offline, but you need a 1-time internet connection as you load up the game and start the story. Two BIG aspects, that makes this one of the most consumer friendly games-as-a-service type game, is the challenge cards and the future content. For the 6 launch heroes, all the challenge cards are FREE, and each one nets you 1300 or so credits. Said credits can be used to buy skins, finishers, emotes, etc. The challenge card for future characters will cost 1000 credits, so if you max out every characters’ pass and save the credits, you’ll have enough for around 7+ future heroes. 

The combat is fluid and allows for more variety as you level up and access other skill trees. There are 3 trees in total for each character and each play uniquely compared to one another. There are also Team Finishers in which you can team up with another companion on a finisher to get a special combo. Your AI companions are reliable and actually do things unlike the ai in some other games. In the future, a ping system and order system will be implemented so you can give orders to your AI companions.

This game is not a cash-grab and it is clearly shown that CD put in a lot of time, effort, and love into making this. They communicate about what they will be doing and have been taking the constructive feedback given to them. The graphics as well are incredible and they are committed to making the game as best as they can. One final thing, there will be new heroes, which are fully free and come with their own stories/villains every 2 months or so, and constant updates, so there will be always something to do.",1599235222,1599235222,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198110948674,174,8,1409,0,565,1600478624

It features an Awesome original Avengers story and currently features 6 unique Heroes with their own skills, gadgets, abilities and most importantly powers. Each character has their own gear and leveling system which encourages you to play and level up as all characters. 
Although this game is quite pricey if you are a fan of Warframe and the Avengers, then this game is perfect for you.
Highly Recommended.
