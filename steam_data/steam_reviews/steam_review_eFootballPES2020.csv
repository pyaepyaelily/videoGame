17,eFootball PES 2020,75980633,english,"[h1] MASTER LEAGUE IS HORRIBLE, LOOKS UNFINISHED, GENERIC, AND TOTALLY UNREALISTIC (when it comes to alot of stuff), ONE OF THE WORST OF THE FRANCHISE..[/h1]

[b] first: PES team, go learn with Football Manager on how do you make a proper simulation of a Championship mode.. (and what it is a real players database..) at least make a similar / ""LITE"" version of it.. and not the cra-pp~y and super generic / lazy made we received [/b]

don't believe the hype, the Master Leagues SU-C-KS, [b] is pure sh-it!!! [/b] , (if you played Football Manager, Championship Manager at some point of your life, prepare to hate it even more), is so unfinished, generic.. the uncompleted interface is a torture, you always has to waste lots of times to get a simple information, it's a complete joke and time waster.. zero workflow, and navigation through that is always a test for your patience, unless you don't give a s~h-it about making a proper formation/tatics for your team..

it's like they had ANOTHER team of designers that never had some contact with a proper football management mode in their life and ended up designing that bizarre thing they call master league, and i didn't even started to talk about the Interface of the thing.. the contracts how ridiculous limited are, scout list another pain to navigate through.. man, it's too many things that I can't even remember it, IT REALLY IS GENERIC, AMATEUR AND LAZY MADE.. 

[b] With is a shame.. that thing could be the Golden Goose of the franchise if made in a proper way (proper players database, interface, how to handle contracts, etc..).. The moment these guys *reverse engineer, or, make a partnership with the Football Manager guys, this will be a undisputed champion of the franchise, easily. [/b]
*(contracts wise, some of the interface and specially, players attributes database + some other stuff that could benefit the game, these development decisions that are decisions that don't take too much time and money to make, or at the very least, it's worth it in the end.. it really is only good production decisions and how a football management mode should be, at least a ""LITE"" version of it would be very welcome, and necessarily a cra-pp~y and super generic / lazy made as the actual one)..

[h1] INTERNET MATCHES / ONLINE PLAY SIMPLY DON'T WORK [/h1]

Get ready to be tested.. not by your skills, but your PATIENCE..

Even with 250Mbps internet speed, [b] EVERY [/b] match is laggy at the point of in your 3rd match you will quit / turn off this game frustrated for not being able to play one decent match without glitchy interferences.. The ONLY game of dozens & dozens here that I experience that, even the indie games with more players online I am able to play smoothly.

Without mention, during the matches, there's ZERO communication, sense of community or social vibe (because of that) or even a subtle online feel of it, since every information about the other players is super obscure.. you can even forget that you're playing online because everything is so dull, looks like a 90's generic online game experience, with no talk, interactionl, etc... [b] THIS IS NOT FOOTBALL.[/b].

If you guys are afraid of players crying because they're being abused.. JUST GIVE THE F U C K I N G - O P T I O N to each player choose if he wants to have mic ON or OFF.. and a signal showing that, obviously.. 
Go learn one thing or two with CS GO, it would improve x1000000 the experience of the online play, and the addiction of it.. It's looks very [b] AMATEUR [/b], don't feels like a 2019/2020 game.

[h1] FORMATION / TATICS INTERFACE IS HORRIBLE, A PAIN AND SLOW TO NAVIGATE AND GOOD LUCK IF YOU HAVE MORE THAN 3 TACTICS TO SAVE [you simple can't] [/h1]

These konami guys must be sa*dis-tic, year by year the PC and videogames got even more hardware space and these guys year by year limit yourself to save tactics even more, like, you can only save 3 tactics.. W-**T*-F*-?????? even Winning Eleven on PS1 you could save at least 10 different tactics, so you could use your top 3 or 5 favorites for example, and polished the other ones.. 
Wake the f*-uc-k up!! you don`t need a f-u-c**,k-ing memory card anymore, no need to save f-u-cking space..
(To be completely honest and not only point out mistakes, I have to highlight the advanced settings, that thing works, and is one of the best of the franchise.. to be exactly only the Attack and Defense section.. if you want, it`s simple to have a team that pressures the adversary in their field, or a team with like possession and plays like Guardiolas`s tik-taka..)

[h1] [b] INTERFACES S**U-C-*-K-S [/b] [/h1]

It explains itself, one of the worsts of the franchise, everything needs way more clicks, there`s almost no shortcuts.. you have to travel with the game cursor all the way again everytime you misspoint some menu, choice, option, etc.. The same goes to the Tatics / Formations menu too.. It`s horrible

[h1] STAMINA IS UNREALISTIC, THE PLAYERS DOESN`T LOOKS LIKE PROFESSIONAL PLAYERS [/h1]

Pro tip, if you manage to use tik-taka, constant pressure, etc.. your players will run out of Stamina way quickier.. BUT... EVEN WITHOUT THAT, that sh*-itty unfinished game treat players like they are amateurs who can even manage to play a full match with being 0% to 10% stamina at the end.. WHAT THE F**-UCK?? You Konami guys know these ARE PROFESSIONAL PLAYERS right??? Their resistance is no fu-*cking joke.. Is clearly a case of nerd designers who never player football in real life, and think that a human being can`t resist playing a 90min football match.. Horrible design, direction and choice of the production team..

[h1] DATABASE S-*U-C-*-K-S [/h1]

Nothing new here.. always was like that..

KONAMI GUYS, GO LEARN ONE THING OR TWO WITH THE FOOTBALL MANAGER DESIGNERS WHEN IT COMES TO FOOTBALL PLAYERS ATTRIBUTES.. NOT ONLY BARCELONA AND VERY FAMOUS CLUBS HAS PROFESSIONAL PLAYERS YOU KNOW??? THAT DATABASE IS DISGUSTING.. YOU AND THE FIFA GUYS LEARNED NOTHING WITH ALL THESE YEARS.. If I was the PES director, I would use the Football Manager database as a reference, even the one from the year before it would work marvelous.. [b] It would be the perfect fusion [/b].

[h1] ONE POSITIVE THING, GAMEPLAY [/h1]

That thing here, I believe they got it right, or almost right at least.. The matches can really be a cool experience.. (but since you can`t play online vs random people, this don`t matter, since you will be bored of playing vs computer only).. without mention, it`s annoying to not know which player had scored through the match by the way, and which players has the best Free Kick attributes in a detailed way, since they only show 1 attribute there nowadays, and hide stuff like Curl, and Loft Ball..
One thing that is very strange, is that the ball hits the post much more than in the real world.. it's like it's purposely codified / programmed to be like that, maybe to give it more 'emotion' or climax through the match, BUT ends up feeling synthetic, even predictable, and not a skill based thing and gameplay, it simply don't feels right.. It needs a little bit more of randomness to give it a real experience so you don't feel like you're playing in a digital pre-manipuleted world, but a organic one (at least in this particular topic to be specific)..
Ah, almost forgot: THE PLAYER RATINGS AT THE END OF THE MATCH IS THE WORST OF ALL FOOTBALL GAMES..


----------------------------------------------------------------

[h1] CONCLUSION [/h1]

[b] That`s it.. since they don`t seems to care to their old huge time supporters and fanbase, think twice before sending money to them.. Probably your complains will be not be heard (AGAIN).[/b]

I've played iterations of football games since 1995 and this is by far my worst ever experience with a football sim game.

Defending is atrocious. Don't bother trying to win a header off the opposition goal kicks, their attacker will calmly chest the ball to their feet despite you flailing over them to win the ball. Try to tackle them when the ball is on the ground and you'll more likely just draw a foul than win the ball. Even minor contact results in AI foul. They're able to jockey you off the ball 100% of the time, regardless of player size and skill. You might win 1/10 tackles. 4/10 they'll beat you or pass it. 5/10 will be a foul against you.

Good luck having your AI intercept a pass too. They'll just idly watch it go by them unless it happens to go directly to them. Player AI is so sluggish and unresponsive that players take a few seconds to realise the ball is in their vicinity.

Attacking is better but God help you if you try and dribble or do a skill move past a defender. They'll pick the ball of your toe 99% of the time and your attacker will flop to the ground and start complaining so you can't even try to win the ball back. First time shot with player rated 85+? Good luck hitting the target. It's almost like watching a Sunday league player take a shot. Even 1-on-1 with the keeper from 18 yards and players 80+ don't want to hit the target. Player with 85+ ball control? Enjoy the ball bobbling and bouncing on your first touch every time.

I know that there's a line between having players that are infallible/godly and having the game be realistic (taking into account ball speed, balance, strong/weak foot) but it sucks all the fun out of the game when you make a break and the player with 86 in finishing forgets how to place his shot and instead flops the ball to the keepers hands.

Keep in mind I didn't play online, only Master League and BAL. I started with the difficulty on Amateur to begin with and despite it being quite boring and easy to win matches, I still experienced all the things above. I did move up to Regular difficulty and it just increased the instances of these things occurring.

I love PES, honestly. But I can not accept the what the developer have done to this game. 

First, the higher levels do not mean the harder your opponents bring. It is just that your players keep processing more and more idiot.

Amazing graphics (10 times better than FIFA), nice physics, nice passes, nice shots, seemingly OK controls. Much more realistic than EA's title. But then I started playing myClub online - the thing I actually bought the game for. Guess what - the gameplay is equivalent to getting kicked in the balls multiple times (so it's basically the same crap as FIFA).

I swear to god - whoever scores first in a match ends up winning at least 4-0/4-1, maybe even more. It's like the team that concedes first can't play football anymore after that - simple passes fail to reach their destination, shots lack power and direction, and there is no way you can steal the ball as it is magnetically attracted to the opponents to a point where it's ridiculous. 
Meanwhile, the player who scored first is having the time of his life scoring impossible goals from every shot like real life ball physics don't apply to him anymore. It's been like this since day 1 and hundreds of updates later this is still the case. I thought I am just an idiot who can't play until I looked online on forums to see what other people had to say about the gameplay. Turns out we are all idiots. Or the online gameplay really sucks, one of these 2 things. Probably the latter.

Also, menu loading times are frustratingly long, the game freezes for 1-2 seconds at each corner kick/goal kick, the music is very repetitive and gets annoying fast.

Ok, so here's the thing, I've played FIFA from 2014 to 2019, I used to absolutely love it, to the point where I had more than 800h of play time on fifa 16, and I only play Career Mode! But over the years, I've spent less and less hours on it because I couldn't have fun with it anymore. And that's the key for me, having fun. And I lost that, I stopped playing football games for a year before I decided to try PES 2020.

I love the gameplay on PES 2020, it's fun, challenging, and it feels realistic, plus I was always a fan of build up play rather than one man dribbling the entire defence, so seems like PES is a perfect match for me. 
Now of course, PES and FIFA aren't perfect games, far from it, both have their strength and weaknesses.
I know the lack of licensing can be annoying, but there are solutions for that on PC, and it's worth the effort, especially since it isn't a particularly hard thing to do. The UI isn't as pretty as FIFA, players aren't as responsive sometimes, and referees are... weird. But again, it's fun! I've felt the love for football again playing this game, something I haven't felt in years! And when I score a screamer in this game, I actually get up my chair and celebrate with the players.

So, if you're like me, and miss the joy of playing football, you might want to give PES a try.

PS: Don't be that ""PES/FIFA is trash"" guy, keep your mind open to trying new things. Like I said, they aren't perfect game, and it's about weighing the pros and the cons, for you personnally.

- Beautiful graphics. My PC can run this game although it's not a high-end PC.
- Stadiums in the game are gorgeous. Player models are full of details.
- There are many national teams in this game, especially all of European national teams and some from Latin and Asia are full licensed. (I like to play national teams as well as master league)
- You can use patch to have real logos, kits, balls, competitions, personnel and all that jazz in the game.

Cons:
- Sometimes I've felt AI's taken advantage of player e.g. refereeing, stamina, second ball etc.
- Can't access the game if you have no internet connection.

Neutral:
- I prefer single player mode. I don't care about online mode. I have no comment about that.

I've never played a version of PES as bad as this with the lack of decent passing. Konami can't even get the right licenses, least ya'll could do is sort your s**t out and make the game a decent experience. Christ.

Additionally, is it just me or does everyone have nobody to play against on MyClub? I spend ages searching for literally no one to connect too. Konami, little advice... Get good or get f**ked. I put time into this game to build a decent team and use and the best connection I can get is on one bar and obviously using Wi-Fi from Mars. 

This feels like what FIFA was like years ago with slow as s**te defenders being able to catch attackers with the 'Speeding Bullet' trait... Sorry? Didn't realise Pique had 96 speed to keep up with a through-on-goal Sancho...

Also, have some bl**dy desire as a company! You have this insane system of earning points for players to rank them up, but have so little imagination at doing competitions.  Where in MyClub are constant lower level cups? What's the point in you having any players under Rare? There is literally no incentive. And when you want to play with them you either have to play offline as the person you connect with has a full stacked team with all rares which they just spent £20 on. Or you get someone who connects to the net via a very energetic hamster. 

I seriously feel like Konami have NO CLUE about the direction of this game and are just smashing out money grabbing tactics. The passing on this game is SO SH*TE. I get Rijkaard as a player, with insane passing and he can't even get the ball out from under his feet to make a decent pass. And when he does he smashes it into an oncoming players chest or mashes it to someones feet on the other team.

I doubt Konami will do ANYTHING to make this better and I suspect 2021 will be rubbish and taking until 2022 will be anti-climactic at best and be a tremendous return to everything that this series should not be.",1597002977,1597509174,FALSE,2,0,0.503184736,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,208,3,1959,0,627,1597627772

Of course the game has its fair share of issues but they are minor. The UI is still dismal and I really reallllllly hope that someone at Konami can realize how bad of a job they've done when it comes to it. A game this good deserves a good UI. I think this is the one area where PES just loses out to FIFA.

Additionally, the player response rates seriously need improvement as well as the AI.

72,eFootball PES 2020,74194140,english,"Alright, after almost a year playing this game, I can honestly say that is the best football game out there when it comes to realistic player movements, have in mind that FIFA is awful, so beating them in this aspect is not a big accomplishment.

The issue with this game is not the OFFLINE mode but the ONLINE. It is highly based on users consuming new players that are promoted by the game every week, but the game does not offer new and exciting competitions that can actually get you somewhere within the game, the competitions are vague, boring and do not add to your MyClub goals.

If you are an okay player like me (I have 969 points) you will find that MyClub is a painful and horrible way to gamble in each game. The artificial intelligence (AI) of the game is very important because when you control a player, the AI controls the rest of your team, the AI will decide how they will position, the AI will decide if they will make a run or not to an open space and the AI will decide how fast the player will go, regardless of stats, how they will protect the ball, etc.
Well, the AI adjust the difficulty of the game for all players by making great or horrible decisions on the players you are not controlling, for example: if a ball is lose or coming your way, they will often run away from the ball, jump so the ball will go underneath them and go straight to your opponent, or you will not be able to select the player rapidly so you can control the ball that is coming your way (this is the worst, because our feel helpless while the ball pass right next to your player and the AI does not do anything to catch the ball). 

The frustration is huge because AI decisions tends to ruin game plays for you and the game tends to favorite those who buy new cards every week (so now you see the business behind the AI way to operate). There is also a huge problem with the pass decision the AI makes: Let's say you have two players who can receive a pass but one of them is on offside, it won't matter how nice you aim with your L joystick, the pass will always go to the one who is on offside. Another example of AI stupidity (which is easy to defend, but it bothers me) is when you are defending with 4 players, the other is attacking with only 2 players and he is waiting for his center forward to open up, what you do in real life? you press, right? well, here you need to press carefully by first selecting the closest player to the center forward and following him and then press the player who has the ball, if you don't do it this way, the stupid AI will take the closest defender from the center forward and use it to press the one who has the ball, creating a huge gap. Dribbling is painfully slow and not effective, useless unless you are really good at the game.

Many of the ranking games are a gamble since you highly depend on how the AI will perform in your team, the AI makes the difference from winning to someone with 2000 points or to lose against someone 200 points, is unpredictable and frustrating because you are not actually in control of your performance, you can have the best Ronaldo max out with all strength and balance but let's say you are playing against someone who also has a Ronaldo, normal card at LV 1. I make no joke when I say that if you do not have the AI on your side, you will painfully watch your Ronaldo lose the ball very easy or been thrown to the floor like trash by any defender if the AI wants it this way, while your opponent and his LV 1 will run faster than a bullet and will go through the defense like nothing is there because the AI boost his Ronaldo and has lower the performance of yours (and probably the performance of your defense as well).

So, the game shamelessly intervene in a 1 vs 1 matches and it can go either way, it's a gamble, thus a clear and honest online competition to see who is better at this game is not possible since you can have the opponent and the AI as rivals, you can shoot the goal 20 times and I kid you not: his goalkeeper will become superman and stop all 16, the other 4 will go to the post... and then, in the only approach of your opponent, a weak shot will hit in the back of your defender, deflecting it to your goal and your max out goalkeeper (which cost you money) will act stupidly ( is controlled by the AI) and boom!, you lose the game: 70% possession and 20 shoots?... does not matter, you did not have the AI in your side, so you lose.

I have been experiencing headaches, a lot of frustration and really bad mood which can seriously affect my health, is hard for me try to compete and tell to myself: ""this is just a game"", and it is just a game, but I don't like to be robbed, and this is how I feel when the performance of my players go incredibly lower of what they normally are. This game definitely feels like a robbery. For these reasons I don't recommend the ONLINE game, if you go for a single match against your pal on offline mode, then it's good. If you want to compete against others around the world, please, do yourself a favor, take care of your health and just stay away from it.

Graphics : 9/10
For a football simulation game the graphic is in overall great, you can't compare it with other kind of games. But the faces, stadiums, attire, etc looks quite monotonous. PES 2022 in Unreal Engine 5 looks very badass, you might want to wait for that. 
Gameplay : 9.6/10
Comparing to the other one of football simulation game, PES 2020 has different height of realism in gameplay. Dribbling, shooting, passing, touch of the ball, movements of the player, tactics, etc is close enough to real life.
Game difficulty : 8.5/10
This one has many complains from players, the unbalance of the difficulty is making the gameplay a little more difficult. The regular difficulty is too easy and the professional difficulty is too hard. Some says the legendary difficulty is unplayable because even Cristiano Ronaldo can be beaten by some weak defenders. Even for veteran players like me, it takes some time to adjust to the AI. But I see this as something challenging for the PES series every year.
Master League and Become a Legend : 9/10
Significant changes to the systems compared to the predecessors, added some cutscenes and interviews. The manager face isn't customizable anymore and you are to choose some of the world-known managers. Retired players will be reborn as new 16 year old guy available to be signed with cheap price, some players doesn't want this to happen tho. As BAL I haven't played much yet.
Licensing : 7/10
If only PES has complete licensing over all the clubs.. 

As the online mode, I have seen some complaints about not able to find a match/opponent, laggy gameplay, unbalance matching, etc. I haven't got the time to test it yet. Overally if you like football, if you want to play football simulation game, PES 2020 has the better gameplay in my opinion. I haven't encounter glitchy gameplay that occured in FIFA so far.

35,eFootball PES 2020,73279307,english,"It always baffled me how companies can release product every year which base on the same core game and just change title, make it look a bit different... fifa, pes, nba, nhl, and many other games based on the same principle... very poor attempt to try to sell the same product over and over again with minimal work and expenses done... Got this game on sale, had previous version on sale too... differences? Apart from menu , colours and roosters PES 2020 is step back in almost every level. I am interested only in be a legend mode and this is where all AI - or rather scripting is being exposed. Where do I start?
When you ask for a pass, there are 3 options. When team mate had a ball for a longer than 1 sec, he will either pass you (and that's the only good pass you ever can receive) or he will pass to his team mate and that other team mate will pass to you from first touch, of course not accurate and basically pass is always intercepted. Second option is when your team mate is just about to receive the ball, he will try to pass from first touch, always inaccurate. Last option is when team mate just making a pass to another team mate, that another team mate will attempt a pass to you from first touch, of course inaccurate. So basically asking for a pass shouldn't really be used... Also you can't ask for a specific type of pass like in fifa, so you rely on scripts... Very often your team mate will make a 10 m long pass and lift the ball so opponents could intercept it. Passes forward almost not exist... behind defenders? Again, no.... 
Another game braking issue pass related. You pass to a team mate, only that team mate can touch the ball, no one else except opponents can get it. That leads to ridiculous situations where after inaccurate pass all other team mates just ignore the ball rolling 1-2 meters from them and waiting until opponent gets it...
Similar issue when you pass somewhere and sometimes no one is allowed to touch the ball except target of the pass - even opponent defenders! NPC defenders cant intercept the ball rolling through them...
Really, long time didn't see so bad football game in terms of AI...(or rather lack of it). 
More about passes... try to run with quick contr-attack and ask for a ball when going into clear position with full speed... Guess where the pass will go? Of course not in front of you but behind you where you were standing when asking for a pass...... 
Full backs covering wrong spots on a field not helping wingers, central defenders leaving space to strikers, opponent defenders always being quicker than wingers, players sticking to assigned spots ignoring opponets or ball nearby and so on, so on....
The most laugh I had when after second season as a player of Brighton I was picked to a Premier League team of the season as a attacker with below stats: Right Winger:  22 games played, 6.5 rating 2 goals, 4 assists.... Is it a joke?
The same joke was when I got call up to national team....
I am not even start here on broken free kicks (75%-80%) of them ends with goals.... and also broken player collide boxes contacts leading to far too many completely random fouls in any direction...

I only play single player and the lack of innovation and progress in both games in both Master League and Career Mode in so frustrating. But FIFA is more fun despite some awful features like the scouting.

We all know that everything except the gameplay has over the years been better in FIFA. But I can't say this anymore. The gameplay in FIFA is more fun, it's one dimensional (good luck if you want to play a target man and get crosses in, headers are impossible), it's scripting can send you over the edge sometimes but at least it's fun sometimes. PES is just floaty, passes often don't go where they are supposed to, keepers are dreadful and the worst bit is the player movement. I've lost count of how many times one of my players starts to make a good run and then stops dead... It's infuriating, at least in FIFA you can tell a player to make a run... I've not had a lot of fun with with game but the most has come from FIFA.

I can't recommend either game and what PES and FIFA have now become is extremely sad as a player of the games for over 20 years that there is no longer a great football game.

-AI defenders just stop and/or never engage a play despite the ball being a foot away. Absolutely kills any Become A Legend play as you're reliant on defenders that refuse to do their job.

-Referees are worse than any recent PES by a country mile. Massive collisions go uncalled while the slightest of touches will be penalized. The refs in PES have always been horrible but with the new physics and collision detection this is amplified even worse.

-AI never adjusts tactics during a game. If the tactics are set to long passes, the AI will lump the ball forward again and again and again no matter how unsuccessful previous attempts have been. Have seen games where a team has less than 20% PASS COMPLETION because all they do is kick it back to the other team.

– Here are my observations & hopes for the game:
- Hope to see more ""coin integration rewards"" and ""discounted sales"" on the coin store like on mobile.
- Also wish more options & variety on ""cpu play on (MyClub)"" and options for difficulty on it too since you can't find may people to play with.
- ""Unlimited save replays"" would be nice since you're ultimately using your own pc for that. Or at least have the option to save/transfer them as mp4 to & store in pc hard drive to clear the list in game when full so we won't loose replays when the list has reached the limit.
- More ""replay camera views"" especially one that moves everywhere and with ability to move the cam angle a lot higher not just on terrain/player level.
- A faster progression on ""Star or Become a Legend mode"" would be great. And extra player leveling when scoring goals on matches.
- More ""upbeat EDM type songs"" (got a lot I like at my soundcloud btw).
- Anyway, great effort on the 4K resolution as well since I normally play that way and it manages great.

Keep up the good work.

Also, I have Aduriz as my target man and he has rating of 91 in heading but can't even score a header and lose air challenges to a shorter and lower rated CB. 

I use to believe that FIFA was the only game that use scripting but unfortunately this game does it too. During derby matches, my opponent striker can finish outside of the penalty box while running with the ball at full speed meanwhile I have to let go of the R1 button to give me at least a CHANCE too score something like that and if the opposing team defence didn't manage to do a world class tackle to my striker like they always do.

Somehow, they made it a LOT worse in eFootball PES 2020. Most of the time, defending is utterly broken, with players just not going for the ball, but running straight past it and defenders taking ages to clear a ball out.

Proporcionalmente inverso, se você for na base do toque de bola, consegue fazer um gol muito fácil. Essa disparidade faz enjoar o game muito muito fácil. Sem falar no nível da IA dos árbritros, é irritante de tão tosca. Um carrinho perto da área, em uma jogada para gol, não é para cartão, mas uma disputa ombro a ombro no meio campo, é.

+somewhat enjoyable and satisfying gameplay, something I struggled to find in FIFA for a couple of years
+the servers aren't garbage
+way more national teams than FIFA has (all UEFA teams are here)
+master league is really good and immersing, despite not being anything special

-the scripting gives you a huge boost in the last minutes. for example it's way easier to score a goal in injury time than normally 
-I will never understand the point of PAS League and fake national teams

I don't play PVP. I only play PVE in campaign modes on Top Player difficulty (I believe has been the most balanced difficulty even since the older PES). Here's my review:

[h1]PROS[/h1]
[b]x- Crowd reactions are cool (atmospheric, vibes etc.)
x- Animation- fantastic (with exception to cutscenes, will explain why in CONS)
x- Innovative dribbling/defending control schemes and mechanics- a major improvement from 2019 [/b]


[h1]CONS[/h1]
[b]e- Cutscenes- massive downgrade from previous versions.[/b]
They made it so that every player is the same height e.g. Messi is standing shoulder-to-shoulder with VVD in ref cutscenes. I understand it's so that it's easier to animate the interaction between the players (skips clipping/hoverhands) but honestly I prefer the clipping and hoverhands than making Cristiano stand as tall as Hazard. It's super awkward to look at.

[b]e- Defending/dribbling is ridiculously stacked against you (vs. COM).[/b]
If you dribble with Suarez (who not only has good technique, but is strong enough to maintain balance while shielding away many defenders), even the flimsy Coutinho can simply stick his leg in, make you trip, and take the ball from you (nothing from the ref).
If you press with VVD and bump with your shoulder, even the skin-and-bones Sterling can hold you off as he dribbles from the middle line all the way to the penalty box and take a shot.
The Physical Contact, player height and weight stat are essentially useless.

[b]e- Refball.[/b]
You can be dispossessed by obstruction, pushing, pulling etc. and the ref will pretend he doesn't see it, but it goes the other way when you dispossess the same way. The ref will always blow foul.
Also some very outrageous tackles that gets my player a 2-month injury gets no booking.

[b]e- Flawed contact-ragdolling system.[/b]
Sometimes the animation follows through which causes some players to trip, stumble and fall, and the ref will foul you for this (never the COM, just you), when it clearly has nothing to do with the ball or possession or even anything cynical.
Also you can abuse the contact system by placing your player in the way of a running COM player. If he's running to chase the counter-attack, you will slow him down. He will keep the same path despite your obstruction instead of avoiding you. It looks ridiculous.

[b]e- VIRTUALLY ALL THE COM FREEKICKS GO IN. ALL OF THEM. EVERYONE IS JUNINHO WHEN THEY TAKE FREEKICKS.[/b]
Even Juninho misses IRL from time to time.

[b]e- Scripted player movement.[/b]
Whether or not that pass will connect is determined by:
1. The passing stat for direct passes.
2. The passing stat, and pace stat of the recipient for through passes.
This is logical up until you visibly see that that player should have been able to receive the pass but suddenly slows down because by measure of stats, he shouldn't have been able to. It's a stupid way of implementing stats logic. This has been the case for PES for many years back-to-back. The same stupid implementation goes for defending. A player who should've been able to intercept suddenly slows down and allows a goal to be conceded.",1591595581,1591596408,FALSE,163,9,0.862837732,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,169,27,7274,0,7274,1591454700

10,eFootball PES 2020,70383370,english,"Okaaay, so Fifa player here, I've given PES a good run, and it's alright, physics are the main selling point, most definitely. As in collisions, and the impact of player motion on the game in general, that's where PES shines, while Fifa in comparison has the tendency to feel like it were played on ""rails"" at times.. 

When it comes to looks, PES is in all honesty outright atrocious.. The visuals in PES only work from the ""gameplay perspective"", thus from relatively far away, as soon as the camera gets closer, things start to become so clunky and ugly it almost comes across like a game from the late 2000-era.. Furthermore, everything that is UI or menu/tab related is significantly inferior to Fifa, especially on PC. In Fifa the game at least recognizes that you're using mouse+keyboard, so if you like working with stats et cetera, Fifa is easily way more convenient. 

Talking about stats or attributes, there are fewer ones in PES, so less stuff to play with when you come from Fifa.. Online sources like sofifa are also more sophisticated than what is available in comparison.

Licenses, you are completely dependent on the goodwill of modders in PES, something to think about.. Additionally, downloading +10 GB from some free download site with extremely low download speeds every single time Konami releases an update is, oh well, you get the point of what I mean when we talk licenses.. 

Refereeing seems even more incompetent than Fifa's. PES punishes you more for button spamming tackle or not timing your passes correctly, but offsides, fouls, refereeing in general is convincingly incompetent in PES.

Set pieces are way too easy, I needed about two attempts before I started scoring almost every single time.. Fifa is better..

Scripting, well, in all honesty, in Fifa, I am actually able to “handle” scripting, I kinda get its language, and what it wants me to do.. It’s mostly a matter of trying “hard enough”.. PES is mostly similar when it comes to the ways “scripting” is being expressed on the pitch, so be prepared for the usual nonsense...

After playing PES for almost 100 hours, playing Fifa 20 for the first time since I dropped it back in February, after they changed ultimate difficulty, I really must say that I appreciate the high production value Fifa actually has, it feels so much more polished and refined that I simply prefer it over PES, even when PES’s gameplay indeed has aspects that are superior over Fifa. PES’s advantages, however, are simply not meaningful enough to me to make the switch over to PES.

24,eFootball PES 2020,67426857,english,"OK so I have spent ~150 hrs with this game. Here comes a fairer review:
THE GOOD:
- Shooting is better and easier. In 2019, most of the time you can only score with R2 + X (controlled shoot).
 And that's it.

THE BAD:
- Default passing control is totally shit, very hard to pass the ball to the right player and the right power. PES 2020 downplayed through balls and passing to a point that game is much less enjoyable.  I had to set Passing Support to Level 2 to have better passing and attack. I can easily beat the Super Star level but still struggling with Legend level, mostly draw 0 - 0 with them all the time. Football is a team game, passing, one two, through balls are the main methods of attack, remember that.
- AI still does shit hack sliding tackle like 2019, very frustrating. They get away with sliding tackle from behind or just yellow cards all the time. Sliding tackle has very low accuracy and rarely used in real football, remember that.
- AI now is fouled every time you touch them although ball is clearly won, this is much worse than 2019.
- Attackers took too much time to accelerate on-the-ball that's why you always feel defenders are too fast.
- Years gone by and your defenders still can't intercept balls or watch lose balls slowly passing...
- AI dribbling is ugly, always show their ass against your defenders and start pivoting around until your defenders are behind.
- AI shots are insane, always with tremendous power and accuracy even with white stats strikers
- Online: forget about it. It takes you 30 minutes to get matched with someone and then you need to endure all the lags.... COM match is always at Regular level, low rank team vs your legend team ... so boring to play...

CONCLUSION: It's shit, worse than 2019 and a waste of money to purchase the full/legend edition if you want to enjoy offline gaming...",1587037569,1591261028,FALSE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,7,1,15973,0,3677,1598765455

36,eFootball PES 2020,70181721,english,"Frankly, I have been a WE fan for 10 years or so, well of course it is called efootball now. I am always looking forward to new series every year and KONAMI has always been providing new ideas for the game. But I would be dishonest to say efootball PES 2020 was a perfect game. Truths is PES 2020 is barely satisfactory. Since PES is an annual type of game, KONAMI seems less motivated to run the services for long. MC online games are frustrating due to high pings, needless to say. Online players are insufficient to maintain a high level match making which will only make PVP condition worse. 

Online mode aside,  PVE also presents serious problems. PES now have 8 different difficulty levels which , if I remember correctly , was 6, several years ago. Well it is nice trying to bring challenges to players like me with a lot experience playing PES. But legend mode and super star mode went a little too far. It is almost impossible to tackle the dribbler using X, but when I try to block the ways of further going, the AI will cross over with great ease like everyone was Messi or CR7 no matter what OP the player truly was. Even if I successfully block the ball without X, the defender won't know he had the ball and it would be taken back immediately. And when AI MF sends the ball forward to their FW, my DF just somehow step back allowing the opponent to turn and face the GK directly??? What the hell was that? I didn't say this is uncool, at least make it fair, after all players have delays after pressing the button. How do we play when AI tackles the ball easily and never lose the ball in possession. And when play a slide tackle, any slightest miscalculation will lead to a yellow card, the player seem not know where the freaking ball was and AI seem to avoid a slide tackle smoothly only for you to tackle their leg. who does that???

Expect for the imperfections, I am always rooted for the game. Do I recommend this game? hell yeah. All the CG and press conference in ML makes the mode more pleasant. One humble advice, why not add the same to BL mode or more details when experiencing a player's career, wouldn't that be great?

42,eFootball PES 2020,70144598,english,"Excellent improvement from the last iteration I played, PES 2018. I am a strictly offline (Master League) player so if you are someone that plays online, this review most likely won't be for you. Spoilers for Master League do follow!

Master League has been improved upon with some more depth; you get to decide what your goal is at the beginning of the season (Win the league, 6th place or higher, or 13th place or higher). Failing to reach the goal could lead you to be fired. Gone is the ""Owner Satisfaction"" percentage of 2018; you only know how satisfied the owner is at certain (sometimes random?) points in the season. I hear you could be fired at any point during the season, but as this has not happened to me yet, I can't comment on that.

Also retooled is the crowd audio slightly; gone are the generic English chants that blast out every single game. It does appear that changing the camera from the default view to ""Player"" (which is what I always use) oddly affects whether some chants are playing or not (I remember 2018 having this issue too). However, when you score, the crowd cheer is different depending on what region you are playing in. An English crowd cheers differently than a Japanese one, for example.

The PA announcer is also brand new. After a goal he announces the number and name (if available) of the player that scored, and the crowd cheers afterward. A detail I've yet to hear anyone else mention is the fact that the PA announcer announces the attendance of the match during the 60th minute; these numbers are not random, it is chosen from a pre-determined number total. However, one thing I truly like is the ""network"" feel of the scoreboard; with the purple Premier League on it it almost feels like a real broadcast.

The game's difficulty in general seems to have been increased as well, but I cannot talk about this too much either as I have not assembled an all-star squad yet. However, I can say that it *does* feel harder, and every goal feels EARNED. I 
can't do the same thing every match with good success like I used to in PES 2018. The ball physics are the realest of any soccer game I've ever seen, undistinguishable from real life if I was to be honest.

The game's optimization seemed to be bad when I first bought this game in November 2019 as I had struggled with framerate issues; however I looked up gameplay on YouTube with my specs and copied the settings I saw in the video and it now works flawlessly. I can even stream gameplay to my friends without any lag, which is a very delightful surprise. If lag was an issue for you before, I recommend looking up this game on YouTube with your specs and copying the settings shown in the video. 

I highly recommend installing some CPKs and getting option files for the most realistic experience. I have one that removes the generic/KONAMI ads in stadiums, and replaces the PES adboards with adboards of real company logos. There are ""patches"" out there that add leagues such as J1 League, MLS, and Bundesliga, but I do not recommend using them as the format of the leagues in-game do not change and are still tuned to the PEU, PLA & PAS Leagues. One patch I used replaced the PLA League with the MLS, and I was disappointed to see that the PLA League format with its first and second phases was still intact, and also missing was the Seattle Sounders & Portland Timbers.",1591016518,1591016518,TRUE,7,1,0.583108962,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,66,6,15640,2,4521,1601062896

If the pass gets blocked and it bounces back to the player, the player then just ignores that the ball ist within grasps. He continues to run forward as if he put his mind to the fact that it will reach it's teammate.

43,eFootball PES 2020,68736383,english,"This is a football game where players don't want the ball. It takes at least 2-3 seconds in game for a player to register and react to a loose ball in their vicinity(way too long and too late at the speed the CPU play in this game). This results in through balls going nowhere because your players don't run or move to it, player switching also doesn't register the player closest to the ball so whether its assisted or manual you can't toggle to the player you want to control in  time. 

 This also leads to you conceeding ridiculously brain-dead goals that would have been avoided had your player just done the bare minimum or what you instructed them to do. This includes headers which are 1 in a million this year to actually connect or hit an open goal that is 2 mm away. 
The catch up bug also lives, try switching to a player closest to the attacker on a run and your player will pause to let the attacker continue on his headlong attack.

 You can play for hours, 959 by my estimate and experience only one penalty given for you. Appaling and obvious kicks, tackles, eye gouging and fouls happen on your players during gameplay and the game just does not register them as fouls. 

Players love the grass this year, the slighest touch or contact sends your team careening to the ground and losing balance. In fact, the players fall to ground so easily that its common to experience headache inducing interactions where players just fall get up run into each other fall get up and repeat like some slapstick bit.

Physicality makes no sense this year, opposing players turn into Hercules when they are near the box, literally walking through and around 2 to three players that are pressuring them on the ball. This is not to say that they dribble through your team, no they literally just walk and push them aside, three men to one? No contest. I have seen Lorenzo Insigne bully Van Djik and Matip to outmuscle them into goal. Lorenzo Insigne! 

Indeed it feels like you're not even controlling your players, instruct your player to pass left and around a player marking them, no they insist on shooting the ball straight center at their marker.

This game has gone the deep end, their commitment to realism have created a code too complex for them to figure out, and a game too buggy and broken to enjoy. All the problems they experienced from launch day are still in the game. Empty promises, empty assurances. Get PES 2018 instead, or even 19 which became better after the numerous data packs but leave this version in the gutter because its filled with bad ideas and bad follow through on promises.

55,eFootball PES 2020,68628084,english,"I have been playing football games (mostly career mode) since 2008 , i stopped buying pes after pes 2013 because i didn't liked their new engine , also they did not release the pes 2016 and 17 new engine on PC , meanwhile i really enjoyed the fifa games over the years, however in last couple of years i am tired to playing the same fifa game every year with totally neglected career mode and wanted to get back to PES , hence , I brought this game exclusively to play the master league.

There are some things i really liked in PES 2020 -

1) The graphics are miles ahead of FIFA.
2) The Master League mode is really nice , offcouse lot of cutscenes and all but its all skippable and feels immersive to me.
3) One feature of PES i always liked (which some people hate) is retired players are added back as youth low rated players .Personally i hate playing with generic players and this feature is something i really admire.
4) Ability to install MODS/LICENCE patches is a great addition and take care of team licensing issues.
5) Gameplay is realistic.
6) Contract negotations are not that straight forward , u cant always get the players u want as players sometimes will refuse to come to a lower ranked club or ask for a lower release clause , it feels much close to how actual transfer works,

Now things which i don't like about this game -

1) The gameplay , though realistic , feels a bit too realistic and sometimes spongy, the ball does not feel like a ball but like playing with a feather it feels like it got no weight, , also my players cant dribble 2m without heavy touches and almost every 1st tough feels like playing with Lukaku , these are professional footballers and not street local kids playing football forgodsake.

2) Performance issues - I have a 144HZ screen and the game gives max 118 fps for me , but it shutters like hell , i tried all the soultions , locked fps to 100 , turned on vsync , cpu affinity solution and everything , only way games runs in playable non shutter is selecting 30fps on setting menu which locks my fps to 72fps. I did not have this issue with the DEMO version.

Overall i would kinda recommend this game if u want a immersive career mode / master league experiance.",1588700373,1588700373,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,98,20,10784,254,646,1601832391

After playing a solid amount of time, I have a question for the team that developed this: ""Do you want to end the franchise?"" Because if you do, you are moving in a right direction.
Playing against AI in Master League mode is now completely idiotic, like they reused some code from the 90s. Almost every free kick AI takes is a goal. Incredible shots go in. If you start leading, suddenly opposing players are lightning fast and cut your passes as if they read your mind.
Playing against other humans is also frustrating, as it comes down to only one skill - pushing opponent players out of balance. That's it. Literally. Nothing else is so important as this stupid trick.
As a long time fan, I must say - Disappointing.",1588344194,1588344194,FALSE,1,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,3,1,19480,0,15547,1594665220
73,eFootball PES 2020,68364156,english,"I don't get why they keep going 1 step forward two steps backwards, PES 2013 was almost like the perfect football game and then 14 comes along and ruins the whole franchise and it took until 17 to fix it again. 17,18 & 19 were all pretty the same and good enough and made good small changes now this comes along and instead of making good changes it does a PES 2014 again and makes all these changes that no one wanted like making referees give the AI fouls over just winning the ball and then not giving you one when they basically break your legs. These last 3 games felt different on each difficulty where as on this game it feels scripted as i can beat a team 5-0 on Super Star then play a game on Amateur and every shot hits the crossbar and the opposition score every free kick given to them.  Online matchmaking is absolute ass and the UI is a massive step down with awful PNG images of Messi, Dybala & Gnabry and i can barely see the the text at the bottom of the screen which is promoting things about the MyClub mode. One step up in this game is that we get alot more legends with scanned faces and real names which saves us time from needing to change them ourselves, although i would've liked more but that isn't a big issue as you can download mods with plenty of legends available to you. Master League also has new cutscenes which are cool at first but then seeing them season after season with different managers gets old and i rather just get an option to turn them off. Another thing when it comes to master league is im tired of there being old players being regnerated as 16 year olds, i much rather have more fake master league original players or have the option to have legends be introduced as youngsters later on. All i want is a game like PES 2013 with the realism of the new games (17 & 18) plus the great random selection mode is that too much to ask for. If anyone thinks i only like PES 2013 because of nostalgia i assure you that is not the case since PES 2014 was so bad Konami kept the Online Servers Of PES 2013 up for an extra year. Its like these developers know this yearly release schedule is stupid so they just make these changes to act like the game is different, i rather them release these every 3 years kind of like the UFC games but that will never happen as this is a much more popular sport and if Konami choose to do this they will lose out on money compared to FIFA who would never switch their release schedule since EA are scumbag Money Whores.
Also it has been 4 years and the commentary is the same im getting tired of the commentator saying MoHaMMED SaLah in his robotic ass voice, saying Wjnaldum's name in that weird sneaky tone and saying the same quotes for players for example when someone scores with Dele Alli the commentator would say ""Dele Alli is there anything this kid cannot do"" he has literally been saying this for ages same with Mane he says ""Tremendous from Mane"" can they at least have these guys say the players name in a different tone after 4 years and either give the players multiple compliments or just give them new ones ever year, surely you guys make enough money from you stupid Pachinko machines and the amount of people that buy this game every year. If Peter Drury & Jim Beglin are refusing to record new lines then just keep their lines but offer alternate commentators in the settings. 
If your coming over from FIFA to play this then this is still a step up as FIFA is that bad and you can literally use skill moves and get past the whole team without even knowing what you are doing where as in this game you have to learn to do those kind of things and even after you do it is much harder. I had to get a refund for this game im sticking with PES 2018 with mods which is much better than this game & yes the servers for 2018 are no longer up but the online matchmaking in this is so bad it might aswell not have servers.",1588338955,1588338979,FALSE,2,0,0.512923598,1,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,35,10,46,0,46,1588306072

I am using PC for playing. I have playes PES 20 for 23 hours and found it lacking. While it has depth than FIFA AI is as terrible as in FIFA. PES has been promoting itself by claiming most authentic version of simulated football. In real football goals are scored through team plays, thorough balls and crosses. In PES most of the goals can be scored only if you lodge long balls to the striker and that too if your striker has an overall of 85 or above. While its very hard to score freekicks even with Cristiano Ronaldo's ability , even the lesser player's of opposition can score easily with the freekicks. Another thing I would like share is that when you are in control of your player and you want to do a fast dribble to overtake the defenders, viola you find out that you can't outpace even the mediocre defenders. If this is the case why PES is provoding a control button for pace???? And while you try to outpace you are going diagnoly as supposed to go straight...... While defending the  defenders doesn't come forward to attack the ball even if the ball is in a blank space and providing opposition attackers to create chances........

The only option is to remove all restrictions and even then, it is taking around 5-10 minutes (if you are lucky), but quite often it's not finding a match. Also, without the matching making restrictions, it is matching you up with somebody like 10k km away. Understandable, this is resulting in a poor connection with a lot of lag, which is making the game unplayable. This is not a game which could be played this way, as it is fast paced game and you are making sudden moves all the time. I understand this is mostly caused by the fact that the game does not have too much players.

Aside of the matchmaking, the game it self is not bad. Still think this is the most realistic representation of the PES series, but of course, it is having some issues which i think should be taken care of. Fouls are a mystery to me as some cases are looking like an obvious foul from a mile away, yet it is not whistled as one. Literally the opponent is launching my player to the moon and it is considered a clean tackle. There are some weird stuff like this happening.

96,eFootball PES 2020,66853210,english,"** It was a very bad experience for me at Master League mode, so when I decided to buy this game, I tried it in the Local Match mode and it was great because I can choose the good stadium in Day time with shade for my eyes comfort, but in Master League mode the playing at the Night time is obligatory and the kind of stadium is also obligatory which caused tired in my eyes Because of poor lighting and the very pale green color in ground of most stadiums, even if you playing in the Day time the high sunlight also harms your eyes. In my opinion the most beautiful stadiums is in PES 2018. The perfect green ground color and good lighting in the Day and at Night time playing you can found it in PES 2018

** In addition the buying and selling players in the Master League is difficult and there are not many options available as it was in PES 2018. In PES 2018 you may buy a young player at a low price but it alters your playing style completely because he has a special skill that you really need and feel it performed during Play and give you the reason for winning. In PES 2020 all players from 70 to 75 rankings are the same level of performance. You do not feel any difference between them, so they almost playing with same style, which causes boredom during the game. If you want to buy a excellent player maybe you must buy players is very expensive and will take all the club's balance (money) !!

** The simulation of real playing that programmed in PES 2020 is not absolutely amazing there are no creativity from the opponent. All attacks are normal even in the high level playing and always done through one method of attack. When I was in PES 2018 I feel the tactical is very amazing the game does it automatically and game has a lot of variety so I really enjoyed playing in PES 2018

** Really I am very upset after buying the PES 2020 I wish could find it better than the previous versions. I do not deny it has some new features, but unfortunately it does not contain the important basics of fun and professional playing. 

** I hope the programmers of the game read this comments and try fix it in the next version of the game especially in the shape of the stadium (lighting and appropriate green color) it is really important for playing, enjoyment, eyes and nerves comfort

Anyways I have been playing PES since the Playstation 2 era (fanboy) and must admit that this game is the closest it has come to those golden years (PES 3, 4, 5, 6).  

The Good:
- Good graphics
- The gameplay is smooth and fluid (much better than previous games)
- Opponent AI is also been improved from previous games

The Bad:
- Team mate AI can be a bit wonky sometimes (can be really frustrating)
- The passing can also be a bit annoying, does not always go to the intended player (would suggest putting pass assist to its lowest setting)
- Master League really needs an overhaul.

All in all it is a good game, is it revolutionary, no...but it is worth picking up if you are a PES fan.

16,eFootball PES 2020,67723697,english,"haven't played PES in a couple of years, so maybe take these pointers with a grain of salt.

- BAL mode is the same as all the years before

so the ""create your player""mode is 1:1. garbage and terribly dry presentation, no option to skip when you get subbed, teammate AI utterly broken (playing long balls straight into opposition 100/100 possessions, no adjustment of tactics), still won't hit you with a cross if you're wide-open in the penatly box etc)

as far as controlling an entire team... it feels less responsive than previous PES titles (e.g. 18), where you could control the ball really tight with the right players. a lot of the times the opposition straight up bullies you off the ball, even if you try to use their momentum against them to sidestep, and dribble past them, shitty defenders will turn on a dime and just easily nick the ball.

to summarize my thoughts: i used to like PES because of its realism and really rewarding, responsive control/animation feedback, with that (imo) no longer being the case, i think Fifa's probably the better football game for now. not that Fifa's particularly great, but yeah.

25,eFootball PES 2020,67617377,english,"Overall I would give it 6.0. It's still above 5, so I still would recommend this game if you only want to play with a friend. This is quite a major improvement over PES2018 which I had, especially the graphics, player body movement, physical contact, and UI/menu layout. The gameplay is more realistic too, in a sense that you need to really think ahead and cannot just press a button and expect the player to do what you want. However, there are still some disappointments, especially in the Become a Legend. The player ratings are super weird, I played at Man U as a CF in a front two split striker with Greenwood/Rashford as my strike partner. On one game, which we won (2-1), Greenwood was given chosen as the Man of the Match with a 7.0 rating. He only scored 1 goal, no assist, shots 3(1), passes 14(12), touches 17. I was only given 6.0 even though I scored 1 goal, 1 assist (I could have made more had my teammates not miss tap-ins), shots 4(4), passes 16(16), touches 26. On some matches I was even given a 5.5 rating even though I scored 2-3 goals which won the game and tried to  create chances for my teammates who couldn't even convert tap-ins. Then, I was often forced to receive a long pass from the back even when Greenwood/Rashford was closer to receiving the ball, and often times I could make it in time and Greenwood would run away.

47,eFootball PES 2020,67369102,english,"I played PES since I think PES 5, and in the last few years, I get disappointed each year a little more.
PES and FIFA are placing games on the market even if they are not better or improved from the year before, in the case of the last few years they are even worst than then the year before.
Sure there are some improvements in graphics, ball physics and realism of gameplay, but I feel that they are giving you small portions of improvement each year so they can say that they are having improvements rather than give the best game that they can have and a game that player want.
You can find on the Internet a lot of articles on Reddit or on the Youtube from players listing things that they want to see change and every year there are no changes what so ever. 

There are no improvements in some modes what so ever.
I really like to play Become a Legend, I play it since 2008 (PES 2009). 
This mode gets worse over the years or it didn't improve things that needed it. For example, if you play a certain position, let's say attacking midfielder, and you go to the team that doesn't play with AMF you would be forced to play different positions even if you are one of the best players in the world. In Football Manager, for instance, teams adapt for players that they have. For all of your career, let's say 15 years or more nither team would change their original position from the start even tho their team doesn't have an original lineup and would benefit changing of formation. This is extremely frustrated with the national team. 
It need change in algorithm and no one bothers to fix it.
I am not even going to begin that teammates that you play with are playing like they just had brain surgery. Sometimes they just ran away from the ball like they are petrified. I'm not asking for special AI I just want them to be normal like in other modes like in Master League.
All other modes have thair problems, and those problems are dragging for years now.
This is issue for few years now and we cant see changes.
Just improved graphically, updated squads and that's it.

If you are looking to buy this game, don't be bothered.
Play the game that you have, find some squad updates and that's it.
I would really like it if some third company enter the game and PES and FIFA as well would find out that you cant sell your merchandise without customers.

Lastly, it might just be my current skill level, but shielding the ball when you have it is virtually impossible. AI players steal the ball off you way too easily.

yes, the gameplay seems great at first, until you see your players running away from a loose ball, keepers concedeing goals that should be easy to stop, 96 rated defenders missing easy balls, 99 pace 99 acceleration players getting outpaced by piqué and so on... oh and refrees are a joke. Worse than last year if possible. FIX THIS KONAMI!

then comes the online. what a mess... the matchmaking system is completely random, I'm around rank 700 and i get constantly matched with poor 300ish guys AND 1k monsters. Lag cheaters are still there since idk pes 2016? How hard is it, KONAMI, to detect them, ban them, OR maybe change your stupid system so that if they mess with the connection (and mine is still running fine, which is the case) they loose the game and move on? Why on earth should I waste 20 minutes of my day just to see the game cancelled at 90'+3?!?

You still face players who when loosing just leave the joypad for the rest of the match, and that can mean 15-20 minutes of pointless gameplay. I mean, KONAMI, is it that difficult to implement a timer and kick inactive players like almost EVERY other online game does?

GP prizes for wins and tournaments are a joke compared to the cost of contract renewals and packs, which are useless anyway if you decided to buy a few Myclub Coins, since almost EVERY special player is WAY better than any other, so you'll end up finding useless players that will become trainers... for 25k GP?!? seriously? oh and limiting purchases of special players to 3 at a time, and letting you get duplicates is soooo frustrating!

what else... MUSIC is HORRIBLE and repetitive as usual (got a tank full of gas yeah you know really fast gimme everything you got gimme everything you got...). REALLY?!?

MENUS are the same stuff as last year, they've just redone the main menu, the rest is still the same unresponsive mess. going from one menu to the other takes forever, there are loading times every two seconds, plus you can barely tell which menu entry is selected (dark purple vs black: genius choice KONAMI!!)

OH, and you CANNOT reset your block list... so if you're, like me, blocking cheaters and AFKers etc... you'll have your list capped pretty soon. Then one day you'll tell yourself, let's reset, maybe those cheaters quit playing and i can block more active ones... well you can't! You have to unblock every player one after the other, and everytime there's a loading time, a confirmation box... RIDICULOUS.

I could go on and on forever with the flaws of this game, but i think this is enough. Hope KONAMI gets their stuff together really fast, cause this game is an insult to the player base.

Put the money into development, bug fixing, network optimization, idk, SOMETHING, instead of useless partnerships... it makes no sense when 75% of the teams and players are unlicensed anyway and you'll NEED to get an option file to get a decent experience... Let FIFA worry about that and get back to the drawing board to deliver solid gameplay, solid online experience and a 2020 interface AT LEAST.

Until then, i won't be buying this joke anymore

Oh and how hard could that be to implement a way of quitting the game other than goin back to the main menu?!? why do you force us to Alt+F4?!?",1580343682,1581247987,FALSE,59,1,0.816173315,10,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,89,10,22826,0,20677,1589118690

2,eFootball PES 2020,62130767,english,"pes is a really good game don't get me wrong, but i just can't recommend it, over its obvious competition fifa.

PROS
There are many pros to pes, the player career is amasing, with good detail on your stats, i love how you can see your appearances and goals for each club over your history, and how long you were with them. manager mode is quite cool as well, and both modes help you see how your club is growing with the social media follower system. the gameplay can also be quite realistic, it feels like a real football match at times.

pes also has an amasing customisation system for the teams and leagues, allowing you to import kits, logos and even sponsors (which can be seen on a sponsor board behind you in interviews or player signings) adding even more to the endless customisation and realness it can create.

CONS
the gameplay, although satisfying and realistic at times, is often frusturating. so many times I would be in an easy goal scoring position and miss, more often than not. its hard to see why, aiming in pes is very hard to do. players can also feel sluggish and slow to react, making attacks sometimes fall apart because the player didn't react when you told them to. also, once you tell someone to do something there isnt a way to undo that, if you tell them to pass they will pass even if the circumstances have changed. 

the difficulty settings are also annoying, and there isnt much you can do to tweak them to your liking. on one difficulty i would find the gameplay too easy and i would score a significant number of goals, but with the next difficulty it would be far to hard and i wouldn't score at all, there was no perfect or even acceptable middle ground

To add to that, character customisation is lackluster. pes used to have a plethora of hairstyles, but now there are only a few different settings that allow you to make your player, and although they allow you to tailor the hair in a unique way, like how it is parted and its length, i don't think this is good enough for character customisation.

CONCLUSION
although pes is a good game that can capture a realistic football experiance, and has some good features, the only ones that are actually unique are the indepth stats for both your player and manager in career, the ability in both player and manager career to choose your next club, and a kit, team and competition customiser

I made a slow pass, and my player missed it, like it was a shot instead of a pass. Opposition already had very little stamina left, yet they easily outpaced fast players. I had enough of this.

6,eFootball PES 2020,62061452,english,"If you're primarily a player who plays these games offline, such as the Master League mode, then I can't recommend this game. Whether it's a flaw with the game, or my actual skill level, I've found the Top Player difficulty to be too frustrating to find the game enjoyable, and Professional not challenging enough. So I find myself playing Top Player which usually just leaves me incredibly annoyed with this game, and that's not why I play games.

To sum up my frustrations:
The AI can all too easily shrug your players off the ball, and it isn't tied to stats, it seems tied to Top Player difficulty. This does not work the opposite way however, and trying to shrug their players off the ball just leads to this awkward and unrealistic shielding animation where your defender will just kinda ride the AI player without actually disrupting them. It's difficult to put down in words what this actually looks like.

Your players react way too slowly to any loose balls, and there isn't any assistance from the game. Pure and simple, this just results in your plays just staring gormless at a ball rather than doing anything about it, meanwhile the opposition does not have this issue. For example, if you play a ball through the opposition touches it, but doesn't really effect where the ball was going, then expect your forward to either stop and watch it roll past where he would have been.

Briefly mentioned above, there isn't any assistance from the game in places where it needs it. If the opposition puts a cross into the box, there's firstly this issue where the defenders only do what you tell them to, and in some ways that's fine, but in practice it means that only the player you are controlling is challenging for that ball. All your other defenders are going to ignore it, regardless of how close they are to that ball, and the player selection function is hot garbage this year, so you really need to be proficient in using that right analogue stick to select the best player to deal with a threat. And in another aspect, this means in those situations where the ball is bouncing between players in the box, and all you need is someone to put a foot in? The game ain't gonna do a thing to help you here. There used to be an auto-shoot / auto-clear function in a previous PES games, where if the ball went to a player and there wasn't any plausible chance of a player being able to react in time, the game would do it for you. In PES 20, if the ball quickly comes to one of your defenders, doesn't matter how quickly you pressed 'X' or 'SQUARE', he's gonna take a touch and probably be quickly dispossessed and cost you a goal. And likewise at the other end.

All in all, this game took many a step forward from last year, but just as many steps backwards to the point where I play this game and just get angry. I think passing and shooting feel better, the randomness of a players first touch seems more on the realistic side of things. But then it takes these massive steps backwards by absolutely ruining the physical aspect of the game by it massively favouring the opposition AI. Or your own players just constantly feeling sluggish. Whenever I play a game of this, I feel like I'm just battling against some AI.

And in some ways this is always the problem with PES and Konami, every year they have a solid game that could just do with a few tweaks to make it feel much better. But it almost feels like they're avoiding making a close to perfect football game, instead of making the little tweaks where needed, they just flat-out introduce something horrible so it never feels complete. Last year it was low-cross spam that seemed to take forever to fix.

22,eFootball PES 2020,61805675,english,"eFootball PES 2020 is one of the most realistic game ever in the history of Pro Evolution Soccer Franchaises. The game has it potential to be a Winner,  However the game has it highs and low so far. 
The Highs : The Gameplay is fantastic, the cutsenes in Master League is brilliant, myclub in oline mode is fun and addicted to play. The game can produce comeback kings, Giant Killers, Shock Wins and Miracules no matter what mode such as league, master league, myclub, kickoff and cup mode you will play depending on the results. 

The Lows : The game lack of licences of official leagues such as PREMIER LEAGUE, BUNDESLIGA and JAPANISE FOOTBALL LEAGUE and their Clubs too, also there is no UEFA CHAMPIONS LEAGUE AND UEFA EUROPA LEAGUE licences mode because KONAMI didn't secure it partnership because of EA Sports FIFA which is so Frustrated. But Hopefully they would bring back UEFA CHAMPIONS LEAGUE and UEFA EUROPA LEAGUE and other Licences League in PES 2021 Game in the Future.   

In My opinion, Pro Evolution Soccer Game is like a Relationship, Marriage and Divorced which is better saying that You love the game and You Hate the Game at the same time. 
Also, If EA Sports FIFA didn't have all of the licences in the first place chaces Pro Evolution Soccer would become the best Soccer game in the world.

This version requires some getting used, some acceptation that there are many big gameplay flaws, more than previous versions, however, when it clicks, it feels like the best footy game ever played.

83,eFootball PES 2020,61053692,english,"Positives:
1. You can get basically any player in the game, legends are absolutely viable within a month of playing. You can have your own IRL favourites in one team without an issue, probably even without spending money on the game. 
2. Players look good graphically.
Negatives: 
1. Learning curve is massive. Nothing works logically, you have to pass-direct-press 5 button within a second to perform any basic move. Tutorials are there, but will not explain you anything else beside the basics. Then when you try it online, you will get hammered 6-7 goals at least every game until you spend 100+ hours to git gud at the game. No positive experience at all in this regard.
2. Online community even more toxic than FIFA. All players do lineup changes for 180 seconds before a casual matchday game, use up all the pause time in-game. Also very few people play the game at least on PC, so casuals are not welcomed as most of the myclub ones are seasoned veterans who will destroy you. There is NO entry-area for new joiners. Horrible match-making system (star/player rating abused).
3. Dribbling is non-existent, agility is only for Messi, the other players turn like a bus. Overall slow gameplay which is more realistic, but the reactions-delay feels like a second for everything.
4. Interceptions...no matter how good you read the game and position the player to get the ball, it will just roll through right at his feet. 
5. Tackling is really bad at this game, lot of rebounds (not as much as in FIFA20, but still unrealistic). 
6. Overpowered cover players. Yes Messi is the best player ever touched the turf so that is reasonable, but come on Pique...that guy is a cheat code, faster and stronger than any attacker, no matter what is the attributes for it.
7. Scripting. Although I did not played a lot of AI games, it is there and believe that even worse than in FIFA.
8. Tactical-setups are just plain horrible. Even Football Manager has a more simple way of describing and implementing the methods.
9. Become a legend. I bought it for this mod mainly, but holy shit what a scriptfest. All the AI does is hoofs the ball up to the strikers all the time. No variance in play, no different tactics. After 2-3 games you will get bored as all the moves/scenes/goals will look the same.
10. Terrible console-port for PC. The menu system is just an aberration of how an user-friendly interface should look in 2019.

Don't buy this game. It might look better than FIFA if you are bored/had enough of that, but overall it is the same money-milking-scripted shitshow. Also it is the same as PES2019. 
Buying this on sale for 50% off when there was a free version of it coming out within a few weeks was my biggest mistake,. Now I learned this, so not going to touch anything konami-related in the future for sure.

93,eFootball PES 2020,60950761,english,"So, I've been a FIFA lover for about 17 years now, ever since FIFA 2001. Aside from FIFA 2009, I have bought and played every single FIFA since 2001 as well, and I have spent a lot of hours. I have no idea just how many hours it has been at this point, but it has to be anywhere between 3000 and 8000 hours played on FIFA.  

This small review comes from a place of having tried to get into PES in these last few years, but ultimately still sticking with FIFA. In recent years, I have the money and the interest to be more of a discerning gamer, and having heard a lot about PES as the better-playing of the two, I wanted to check them out. But my friends play FIFA, and I love FIFA, so none of the previous PES games got more than 10 or so hours of playtime. 

But this time is different. I bought eFootball PES 2020, and did not buy FIFA because the demo convinced me the gameplay was exactly the same as 2019's FIFA, and while the Street Football (Volta) mode intrigued me, I managed to give myself some real time to spend with PES. And now, I have really have turned the corner on FIFA. I have no idea what I will buy in the next few years, but it could very well be PES as opposed to FIFA, which is really saying something when you consider what I've written above about my perennial relationship with FIFA.

So, my opinion on the game then, and why I think people who love football/soccer video games should try this, even if they are FIFA fanatics like myself? It comes down to one thing. The gameplay is simply amazing. I think FIFA's is amazing as well, but this is different, in that doing many of the actions on the pitch requires some thought on behalf of the player in PES, whereas in FIFA it sort of doesn't. 

I summarize the major difference in feeling between the two games as follows: FIFA is a simulation of football where every player has the close control of Lionel Messi, the playmaking ability of someone like Kevin De Bruyne, and the finishing ability of Ronaldo or Lewandowski. PES is a football simulation where every player has to be forced to correctly perform the actions on the pitch as though they are lower-league players. Most of the time, a pass will really only work out in PES if your player is facing the correct way, has the correct form to put his foot through the ball, and so on. In FIFA, you can ping the ball around irrelevant of where your players are in relations to each other and what they are doing a moment before. As a result, though there is a considerable learning curve to PES (at least in my experience), once you start understanding how to be patient, shield the ball and set yourself up for the move you are trying to pull off, it can feel amazing when attacking moves come together. Then, after a while, it becomes muscle memory and you forget how difficult it was before, much in that same way in which you wonder how you ever struggled to beat an early and previously-difficult-to-beat boss when you replay a Soulsborne game after having beaten it. You internalize the rules, and it becomes second nature. 

In this way, PES can feel much more satisfying, and is more of a simulation of real football than FIFA. Having played football in real life myself, I appreciate how difficult it is to do even basic things like dribble or shoot with a football, even though the pros on TV make it look easy. This does not mean spectacular, Messi-like or Ronaldo-like goals and combinations don't happen; they just happen a lot more in FIFA. When that amazing goal does happen, it feels extra amazing in PES though. 

However, FIFA does win clearly in one department: close control. Yes, dribbling is hard in real life and so PES makes it hard as well, but beating a player just feels more clunky in PES than it should be: there is something that is off about the way players sometimes interact with each other when they are in a duel over the ball. To me, there is a sense of diminished control over the ball in PES 2020 when you are trying to beat a man, whereas in FIFA dribbling feels great. But again, in FIFA it also feels great because you have nearly infinite power over the ball: even a player from the 4th Division can move a ball around as if he were Messi himself there. 

There's the licenses issue, but it is of course relatively easily solved with the fan-made patches. FIFA still just looks better though, in my book. I cannot understand people who say PES looks better. Yes, the players in FIFA have a more waxen-faced look about them sometimes, but the overall quality of the player models as well as the look of the pitch is just closer to the real thing in FIFA, in my opinion. The lack of most Bundesliga (Germany) teams in PES is also a bummer, as it's one of the biggest leagues in the world. Having no Juventus in FIFA is a pretty major win for PES, on the other hand, because FIFA is more unyielding than PES, and so you can't just slap the team back into the game in FIFA like you would be able to in PES.

Other than that, I have only played regular matches and the manager mode, and I like PES' manager mode. Some things are annoying (I think it's not possible to look at a player's detailed information in the menu that allows you to deal with contract and transfer negotiations with those players, for instance, and having to quit out every time and look at the players in another submenu is quite annoying) in it, but it has given me a lot of fun thus far.

This review is getting too long, but here is the gist to summarize: this year's PES has blown me away with its gameplay, and has caused me to abandon FIFA in its favour, which really says a lot considering my everlasting loyalty for FIFA. The gameplay is less intuitive than FIFA's, as it tries to mimick just how difficult it is to do anything with a football in real life, but when you come to grips with it, goals can be twice as satisfying in PES. In FIFA, every player is Messi; in PES, every player is like the striker of your local team who has quite a bit of talent, but can't be arsed to be completely sober before showing up for the game on Sunday morning. When that guy ultimately scores though, oh boy does it feel great.

Por tanto, para quem gosta de ter uma experiência local mais rica, recomendo ir de FIFA 20 até o momento. A modalidade da Liga Master, passou por algumas modificações, e inclusive tem algumas interações de diálogo entre treinador e diretoria - que são totalmente inúteis -, mas herdou o mesmo motor de transações do jogo anterior, tornando a experiência muito superficial de compra e venda de atletas.

47,eFootball PES 2020,60231630,english,"If you're furious at FIFA for its rubber-band effect and totally unrealistic AI behaviour (I'm talking about those games in which no matter how well you play, you simply CAN'T win because the game decided so, and everything seems scripted to the point you just feel like throwing the gamepad at the screen) then...
You have seen nothing yet.

Enter PES 2020, the game in which you can play in the Master League fairly decently at a medium/high difficulty level, and while by no means being a pro player still hold your ground as an A-tier team (say, Tottenham, Rome, and the likes) against S tiers behemots (the likes of Barça or Liverpool)... Then one national cup match comes up and the AI flips that switch: what happens is that a blatantly mediocre 2nd league team (which in real life would have no chance in hell of even challenging your carefully crafted goal machine) magically becomes an ensemble of 10 Messis and one Alisson, backed by a referee who will punish any attempt at even getting close to the opposite team's ball carrier.

I'm talking free kicks taken from the middle of the field (yesterday I had one game in which this happened twice in the same game, literally 5 minutes of ingame time), around 25/30 meters from the goal, sent directly in the corner below the crossbar by some unknown, 60-something skill player - some other reviewer said free kicks in favor of the AI are more lethal than penalties, and I totally agree. I'm talking about other team's players ALWAYS nailing the headers against much taller and more athletically apt defenders (and if that happens in your penalty area, it's a goal 50% of the times). I'm talking every single one of your pass interceptions instantly becoming a perfect through ball to the other team's players. I'm talking about the impossibility of clearing your penalty area without serving a perfeclty placed opponent.

I know what you're thinking: it's just me not playing well and having a bit of misfortune - I should just accept it and enjoy the extra challenge... Problem is, the same switch magically turns my Sané, my Lukaku, my Rakitic in bench-sitting b-leaguers who should never even enter the pitch.
Suddenly they become so inept they couldn't complete an easy through ball even if their life depended on it. They start stumbing on each another while running. They shoot the ball past the sideline after shooting at the goal from inside the penalty area. They jump and completely miss easy crosses while left unchecked in front of the opposing goalie.
(Btw, I played FIFA and PES on and off for over 20 years now, I do know my way around stats, player's statuses and fatigue levels, etc., so this has nothing to do with me fielding out-of-shape or exhausted players, or even having them play off-role.)

And don't even get me started on how the opponents become stamina supercharged running machines while your players always ""stutter"" as soon as you take control of them, so no chance of getting first on that loose ball... Ofc you manage to take a shot, their keeper will ALWAYS manage to deflect it (well, at least that 10% of the times you manage not to incredibly miss the goal completely while shooting from less than 12 meters).
And mind you, when the defence clears the ball, it will NEVER end anywhere near one of your multiple players prowling outside the box: it will always land  very near (if not ON) their only player not on the defensive, who will easily shake off any of your defender's challenges just to run towards your goal and score from 20 meters while your goalie helplessly jumps on the spot.
Another thing that literally drives me crazy (happens SO often) is when I pass the ball forward to one of my strikers facing backwards (i.e.: waiting to receive the ball, his back to the opponent's goal), the ball travels straight towards its intended target, and just before it reaches it the other striker runs back from behind the opposing defense line (running at a pace you'll never see employed when you pass the ball to HIM), intercepts the pass and causes an obvious (and infuriating) offside.

Don't get me wrong, most games just feel fine, with a somewhat fair balance and the sensation that, if you lose, it's just because you didn't play well enough or your players simply weren't on par with their opponents skill-wise.
It still seems the AI cheats A LOT when playing very phisically, trying to outmuscle them or dispossess them of the ball - apparently even their thinnest players can hold their ground no problem against opponents twice their size, while if you're defending the ball, the norm is getting dispossessed of it from behind if you let the other team's players anywhere near you (so you better be good at first touch passes), but that's nothing new.
Problem is, when THAT damn switch flips, there is nothing you can do except try to control your frustration and accept the simple fact you ARE going to lose, or just close the game and hope the switch doesn't turn on again on reload.

Again, the problem is not losing a match: the problem is, the way this happens - a way more befitting a Space-Jam inspired arcade than a wannabe football simulation. I get that making the game challenging and unpredictable is an effective way of keeping it interesting, but this should in no way come at the expense of every single shred of realism, especially if the game's supposed aim is to SIMULATE football.

As you can easily guess, this rant-like review was sparked by one of the aforementioned switch-flips, but then again now that I'm finishing typing this very long text-wall, the rage has subdued, and yet I am still 100% behind what I wrote so far: I would just like to have a football game in which there are no ""momentum"", ""rubber-band"", ""scripted"" or otherwise ""coreographed"" matches... Even if their ultimate aim and result is making me score that last-ditch-effort goal in the most nail-biting extra time... I want that to happen, if ever, because of emergent gameplay (and I've seen enough assuring me this is not the case).
Is that too much to ask?
I know for EA it is (after all, they really don't care about the games, they only care about how much money they can make) I was just hoping Konami, having finally managed to put out a decent PES title after years of mediocrity, would do better.

P.S.: small technical side-note: I played close to 30 hours now and I haven't experienced a single crash or any other technical issue for that matter. Granted, my rig is pretty decent and very stable so I rarely experience technical difficulties, however I thought it was worth mentioning since I see many other people lament crashes and the likes.

P.P.S.: I forgot to mention that localization suuuuuuuucks... Some sentences don't even make sense at all, others say just the opposite of what they should mean - for example, let's say you manage ManU and find an agreement with Barça to give them Pogba in exchange for Rakitic: the game will tell you that Barça agreed to sell you Pogba... WTF?
Also, the ingame commentary is amateurish at best from a technical standpoint (sudden changes in tone and volume in the same sentence, same way an old-tech automatic voice machine would do) while content wise is so poor that quickly gets nauseatingly repetitive while at the same time being completely inaccurate in describing what's happening on the field - EA is years ahead Konami in this compartment, and they're not even the best as 2K sport titles blatantly annihilate the competition on this aspect of the game.

P.P.P.S.: I just discovered this very accurate guide https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1864353869 which details perfectly how frustratingly annoying playing this game can (and will) be. Sadly, I wish I had read it before buying the full game - I didn't know these issues weren't present in the demo (it's even worse). I must agree with those vowing not to buy any more PES (or FIFA, for that matter) titles until that scripting s**t is gone.",1576925347,1576980209,FALSE,1,0,0.5,3,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,93,6,11559,0,1758,1599427138

There are some small quality of life improvements for master league like UI updates, and transfer market reworks. If you have PES 2019, get this one on sale or stick with 2019. If you haven't played PES in  awhile, pick this one up on sale. It's worth $30 in my book, especially when you get into modding the game and creating your own ""what if?"" leagues. I find that the career modes on PES just have far superior customization and simulation to FIFA. That's where the value in this game is: all of the cool single player stuff you can do. If you plan on playing online mostly, just buy FIFA. Don't even waste your time. KONAMI apparently doesn't want you to play online because of how bad their servers and multiplayer reworks have been for the last decade or more.

Playing as single player :

Pros : Graphic is great
Works even with VGA below the minimum requirement of 2GB (I am using 1GB ATI Radeon R250 and only experience a slight fps drop)
control is tight
Ambience is great. If you score at home ground, your fan will cheer and shout. Score at away ground, the stadium went silent for a few seconds before exploding in whistles.
Goalkeepers are not easily beaten. Especially high class ones

cons : I don't understand you can tackle the AI, but the ball can rebound back to them. They can also slide tackle you all day, but not get a yellow card.

I always felt like the Become a legend mode or whatever it's called was really poorly done. No story events, lack luster choices on progression. It felt like a rushed job. Made me so disappointed that I gave up on football games entirely.

On a whim I decided to buy PES2020 to see what had happened since I last played. The answer is: Nothing. I'm sure the graphics engine is way better today than it was those years ago but where the game really needed improvements nothing has changed. Become a legend is still a joyless grind. The progression system is uninspired to say the least and still no interesting story events or mini games/systems. I would like to blame it all on micro transactions and the online mode but to be honest it seems nothing did efen evolve in the years before that was introduced.

In the master league mode the number of tactical options is laughably low and the AI is as frustrating as I remember from many years ago.

Don't buy this game. Mediocrity shouldn't be encouraged. And this game is really mediocre if not bad.

Imagine your playing COD or BF for example. For no apparent reason, your player is slower, your bullets all miss and your enemy kills you easily, with little to no efforts. That's a good analogy to what happens with this piece of biased garbage.

After hundreds of hours playing MyClub, I can say for sure it happens on me and my opponents.
It's really frustrating. It's not worth it. I don't even know if I earned my victories or if the game ""lent a hand"".

Nothing is more frustrating to play against a 600-400 and, no matter what you do, the game doesn't allow you to win. Nothing personal, but the chances of a 400, 500 winning against a 700,800+ are slim at best.

I'm ok with losing if the game is fair (it sucks, but it happens). But I'm definitely not ok with the game sabotaging me or my opponents.

Literally everything is a foul to the opposition. There's no point in the X button because it's 90% of the time a foul to them. 

It'll even gleefully show you the slow motion of you winning the ball cleanly well before they kick you just before you're sent off for it. 

WIn a header but the opposition bumps in to you while you're landing? Free kick yellow card. 

What makes it painful is that the same rules don't apply in the slightest to the COM. I've literally 3 free kicks in 9 hours play despite them booting the crap out of me, often in the box. 

Can't review how penalties work in this game because the COM is allowed to do whatever it wants. I have not been awarded one despite being sent sprawling or just plain tripped while on the ball.

27,eFootball PES 2020,58458430,english,"So let's break this down, cause there's a lot of good, bad, and annoying. First, is this game worth 60? I think so. Is it worth it for anything less than 60? Absolutely. If you can get it on sale, do so, but it's still worth the full price. 
Pros:
~Impressive gameplay and realism
~Impressive graphics and visuals (but not the best optimized game, takes ALOT out of your computer no matter what specs you run)
~Modding community is strong
~Constantly updated with various fixes and tweaks, namely at launch the game did not have the updated goalkick rule (you can now be inside the 18 yard box to receive a goalkick from your keeper) but it was updated to include this rule. 
~Constantly trying to get more licenses with teams and players, and is the FIRST SOCCER GAME to have a fully, i repeat, FULLY licensed Italian second league (Serie BKT).
~Adds in new player faces, and updates poorly done ones to match the quality of the rest
~ML updates and such are a lot more interesting, you can select the transfer frequency, difficulty, your starting budget, and so on now. 
~Adding your own created content is easy to learn and do
~Konami seems more invested into being a better publisher this game, and it really shows, they blow EA out of the water this year in most categories.

CONS:
~Even with new licenses and player likenesses being added regularly, thanks to EA's POS of a game, PES still doesn't have a lot of licenses nor player faces, especially US based ones. 
~Arbitrary difficult hikes, scripted games, and so on are more prominent in my opinion this year, but it does fit more with the realism of what COULD happen in real games.
~create a player still has outdated everything. To the point I can't bring myself to create players because they look so poor compared to the players with even the worst important IRL faces. It's really sad and disappointing to not have creation updated with new models, mesh's, patterns and so on. Namely the same crap has been in game (never had it added, but instead taken out of) for creating uniforms and players. Please Konami, do better. 
~Over all the game still has similar issues to the last few years, similar bugs and such as well, but this time around, Konami IS VERY ACTIVE IN THE COMMUNITY AND LISTENING TO US. I cannot stress that part enough.

Pros And Cons :


Pros
-----

1. Realistic Graphics
2. Major Club Sponsers [ Barcalona, Bayern, Juventus etc ] 
3. Great ways to celebrate a goal
4. Brand new dribbling system
5. Master League Changes
6. Option files [ As Usual ]
7. Despite all the woes and bugs, KONAMI listens to its playerbase but fixes problems once at the time which makes it really hard to enjoy a bug-clean game
8. Realistic and Unusual goals really fuels the game and very entertaining
9. The unpredictibility of Master league matches makes it really realistic and nice
10. Not everything goes to plan which is a motivation for getting better and trying harder next time
11. Tactics and team management alongside team spirit is Too good for FIFA tactical system and offers more depth and ideas to outsmart your opponents
12. Live simulation and Fast simulation is a great addition and saves the noob from losing in a hard match at times
13. The live updates and face scans happen more frequently than fifa updating Faces and team sheets
14. The difficulty of signing new players is really good and realistic
15. Contract re-newals are pain in the ass but again, Realistic
16. Goalkeeping is often moody and their form is based on their condition and their effect, As a goalkeeper IRL this is also nice and correct, In PES 20 they can be your hero or your flop in a game



Cons :
-------

1. Messed up AI response rate to passes and ball control
2. Defending AI's Too powerful and not balanced to a point that defenders predict the next direction you going to 
3. Really hate the commentating lines and their too late reactions
4. No difficulty selection in MyClub which makes it really hard for new Players 
5. Your own players often walk too CLOSE to you while you have the ball which leads to possesion loss and its Pain in the ass
6. AI is too powerful at Free-kicks, almost 80% of all the 20m Free kicks got in and when its far its even worse
7. Defenders often cancel the Button input aka [ Shooting or passing ] for no reason
8. Really gets on my nerves when the game is scripted and you concede in the very last minute and the ref adds 0+ minutes
9. Referee Is a disgrace in this game, If you win the tackle cleanly and the right way you still get fouled for physical contact even if you touch or clear the ball away
10. literally nobody plays online on a daily level Due to small community on PC
11. Servers are laggy and messy at some point
12. Game stuttering is common and happens ever more when you plug in an HDMI Cable from your PC to your TV
13. Tackling is useless at some point after tackling the same player 5 times and he normally gets the ball back after being deflected back to him and 70% of the time when this happens it usually ends in conceding a goal.


7/10 From me, I only switched from FIFA 19 to PES 20 for Bayern Munchen sponsership and the Master League, Its neither bad or good for me but i live for career mode and im really enjoying master league at the moment after leading Bayern Munchen to the treble win and it was great!",1571506070,1574800004,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,91,22,27450,0,10892,1592514750

97,eFootball PES 2020,57364743,english,"Game is a complete waste of time, if you are looking to play long-term modes like the Master League. 

Before getting to the negative points, it's true that the physics, playing style, graphics etc. have improved a lot in this iteration of PES. The way players move, pass, shoot are fantastic and the overall gaming experience is actually pretty good. This is where the positives end, though.

My main gripe so far, is that there is heavy scripting involved to the point where it basically determines the outcome of the match regardless of your effort. Teams like Wigan and Huddersfield suddenly play like Barcelona, with perfect passing, completely accurate long balls, perfect long shots and ultra fast players. It's completely unrealistic and it robs you away of your sense of accoplishment for acing a match. ML matches end up being a chore where you defend your goal advantage against an AI on steroids. This becomes especially evident if you are close to the end of a match (80+ minutes). It's a futile effort against a clearly cheating AI.

Moreover, the referees in this game make completely unrealistic calls. Even a simple touch of the opponent is instantly a foul and in many cases a yellow card. In reality most of these would not even be called, let alone warrant a card. AI will almost always avoid fouling you (this has improved a bit lately) so you end up the match with 5 yellows and possibly a red for playing normally. Even things like Offsides end up being wrong occasionally, which is unbelievable considering how straightfoward an offside usually is.

Your own AI is completely broken. Defenders look at the ball pass in front of them without taking action. In the offense, no one makes an effort to free up themselves so you can pass them the form an attack. It all comes down to an annoying passing game with no end, hoping for a good cross to save the day. Sure, might sound ""realistic"" but ends up being pretty boring and fruitless if you don't play long matches. Headers have been severely nerfed. It's super hard to actually score one even if your player is completely alone with the goalkeeper. Same thing with longshots, I would say but don't quote me on that. The general feeling is that longshots are only reserved for some special players with specifics traits that can actually score from a distance.

Exhibition matches are ok and obviously if you play with a friend you might not notice some of those things. If however, you wish to play ML or BAL modes, you are in for disappointment. I don't know if Konami has any plans on improving this but I really hope so because right now that game is a completely luckluster experience. I've tried getting into the game again and again because it really looks like an improvement compared to the previous games but a single match in ML reminds me all the points made above and I end up turning it off before the match ends.

As usual the licensing constraints have made the vanilla version look a little bland.However the pes community at www.pesuniverse.com and www.pes-patch.com have fantastic mods for full kits,correct team and player names,emblems badges,crowd songs,boots,faces and so much more and I have to be honest when I say that when these are added it is the most beautiful looking football game I have ever seen. (I started in matchday on the sinclair spectrum with the rubber keys) So I`ve seen a lot.
The game had somewhat of a ropey launch and has undergone some tweaks since then. Most notably your team-mates dont run away from the ball now....most of the time.The player select isn`t the best at times and still needs some work from the devs as well as a goalkeeper buff and an adjustment to referees for certain collisions.But overall this is by far the best football game ever made in terms of gameplay.
Nothing much new about the game modes,Master league,BAL etc are pretty much as they always were and the UI still looks like something from windows 98. The commentary is probably best left un-mentioned..and if you`ve added the crowd packs from pes-patch I`d strongly advise muting Jim Beglin and his honking patter and enjoying the atmosphere from the real fans of loads of clubs.
Go on Buck! Tell us about the online mode,I hear you say. Okay then,it`s the same as last year.Why Konami haven`t copied the structure of the Fifa online is beyond me. Scouting system is awful,no marketplace to trade for worthwhile players and a questionable ""scheme"" enveloping the signing of classic players.....cough:cough:buy cashcards,ahem!
Without the mods its a boring old 6 out of 10. With the mods I`d give it an 8...maybe even an 8.5.
Buy it cheap,mod it and you won`t be disappointed.Unless of course your PC has the components of an old toaster.

No, it's not. This is the full game. This is what KONAMI looked at and said: ""good enough"". Unbelievable.

The game play is overall descent. I like that the game is a bit slower to make it more realistic. Fifa should learn from that. But there are too many issues to make it enjoyable. And I really tried to make it enjoyable in all of my 70 hour game play, but it's just not. To name the most annoying ones: 
* Players don't make runs. I know about the LB+Right analog and I've played for almost 70 hours, I know what I'm talking about. The players just does not run.
* Referees are completely stupid. It would almost be better to just remove them entirely. Tackles ON THE BALL are not allowed if you also touch the player. Meanwhile, shirt pulling is encouraged since you won't get any penalty for it, EVER.

1) Improve the commentary. The commentary is my opinion is boring and inaccurate. This makes the game less realistic.
2) The game menus are still the same. C'mon guys, you guys did well to add so many new features to master league, despite that the game still feels like the same old because of the repetitive UI. 
3) After a while the game feels like there is no progress. I think a few more tweaks and additional features like the commentators talking about the performance of the club in the previous season (At least during the start of a new season) can improve the game 10 fold.

55,eFootball PES 2020,56584551,english,"I am a long-time fan of the series, been playing since Winning Eleven for PS1, and this could have been a masterpiece. But if I could use one word to describe this game is LAZY.

Konami makes hundreds of millions of dollars with this game and it amuses me that they just do not seem to care about their fans and players. Go ahead and read the reviews, the same complaints over and over which Konami simply ignores. This is a huge disrespect to the people who made them who they are today. 

My main issues with the game are:
1. AI is virtually non-existant. They seem to have taken shortcuts instead of doing a competent job at programming the game. The players' abilities do not seem to matter, it is almost as if there is a gameplay baseline which is moved up or down depending on opponent's strenght, difficulty level and whether match is home or away. Your players move slower, make more mistakes, ignore the ball, etc. while your opponents all of a sudden become flawless aliens who just score with ease, no matter what you do. Making your players worse and opponent better instead of improving AI quality is just LAZY and DISRESPECTFUL.

2. Master League has no immersion at all. All championships feel the same and it just feels like we are playing and endless stream of individual games. Forget about the amazing feeling of hiring a good player and how he would change your game, and that drive to win and get better ones. It is now just boring and repetitive.

3. The lag and unresponsiveness. Remember back when we pressed right and the player moved right? Forget it, now the players receive the ball, think about their tax returns, then maybe start to move towards... nevermind they already lost the ball and are still performing the movement animation. Playing online is incredibly annoying due to the constant lag - I have a 300mb internet connection with very low ping, yet I have to press the buttons 2 seconds before I expect them to take action.

4. Physical contact is everything. Nothing else matters, this is now a wrestling game. There is no more dribbling, feints, awesome through balls, nothing, just have a strong player and win the ball or get ahead regardless of pace and acceleration.

5. Become a Legend. If you hate maths and need to study for a maths test, play three BAL matches. It will crush your soul in such a way that 12h studying algebra will feel like a walk in the park with a cute and nice girl. Your team's AI is so bad that is almost funny, but you cannot laugh because the anger turned your heart into lava and your soul into a dark and cold abyss of misery and pain. DO NOT PLAY BAL if you like anything about your life.

6. MyClub is not as bad as some comments suggest. It is pay-to-win only for kids with desire for immediate reward. I have not spent a dime on in-game purchases and have been managing to build a decent team. Enjoy the ride you know? However, it is also clearly a cash grab and the lag makes it impossible to enjoy playing.

This game is decent only for playing for fun with mates, but if you already own a previous version this one is not worth it. Not yet. If Konami decides to use some of their millions in profits to improve AI and responsiveness and gameplay overall, then it might become a good purchase.

If you want to have fun, do not buy this game. If you are searching for something to make you really annoyed then go ahead and purchase it.",1572985875,1572985875,FALSE,156,39,0.860479593,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,16,2,14784,4,5022,1600873303

The BAL mode is infuriating as the only tactics they use is 4-5-1 and the 5 midfielders are usually just sat in front of the defence. So you are literally the only player in the oppositions half.
This game is anti-football, if you ever want to put someone off playing a football game, give them this.
A word to the developers, I can not believe how bad you have made the game play in this, it was always the best for me, but FIFA even if it was just a loading screen, would still beat this hands down, and I am trying to like the game. Its slow, clunky, the animations aren't great, the passing is woeful, the all round play is well to be blunt, needs to scrapped, the lot of it, and go back to bare bones.

99,eFootball PES 2020,55109891,english,"The good:
-It is less scripted then fifa 20.
-Visuals look really good.
-Audio is a bit better then last year but still meh.
-Way more freedom in this game then fifa and then last years pes (i used to love fifa but for years its the same).
The freedom and ball control adds a lot of realism which i love.
- I actually love the fact that not all passes are accurate, especially when your not facing the side that you want to pass in. I see a lot of people complaining about that. I like it because it is realistic and you need to think more about your gameplay.
It also makes the game less ping pointy. In earlier titles it you just pass wherever you want and the ball will almost always get to the other player. The bad thing about that was that you are almost not able to defend anything because the pass was given already everytime and will be accurate anyway. Now it requires more skill to pass which i like and which is good for Efootball, there is a possibillity of a skill gap which is nice.
- The defending is not fully automatic which is huge. I hope they improve it even more because holding the X botton is still doing to much imo.

The bad:
-It is scripted while in the demo they didnt seem to do that.
-There were a lot of good things in the demo. Snappy player switching no scripting etc. You removed all this in the final version and switched to fifa style. WHYYYYYYYY??????
- Efootball hmpfh krgh :'D. I have to laugh. You have to have patience for Efootball cause waiting 5-10 minutes is normal in pes20. In this state with the scripting and clunckyness this game is not Efootball ready to be honest. 
-Blocking is a joke. To many times i blocked a ball good with a defender but somehow it get weird deflections and almost always ends up in the feet of the opponent especially around the box. I know that in real life you get some weird deflections aswell but the difference is that in real life it is not scripted and in real life  you can actually have lucky deflections on both sides instead of one side only.

Final:

Overall i like the way pes is going and i think with the freedom and ball physics that pes is better suited for me because it feels more realistic and my biggest point LESS SCRIPTED. I actually have the feeling (most of the time) that the players do what i want which resulted in some sick goals but also some sick passes and combinations. 

I absolutely hate the fact that Pes is going back to this hard scripting in some areas.
I also hate the fact that Pes removed features from the demo which were well received. It feels like they were not confident enough about it or something i dont know why they did that. 

I feel kinda tricked by these actions.
This is a mixed review because there are many positives in this game but i think they need to get back to some things out the demo.

Final say:
Don't buy this game yet if you expect this to be the expanded version of the demo.
Buy the game if you are tired of fifa being fifa and cashing out easily for many years. Really give this game a good chance. It is getting in a real good direction. This game is far from perfect but the future looks bright.

All in all, I must say, that I like PES 2020 a lot this year. It's a big improvement over last year.
However, it's not perfect. Gameplay is fully different from the demo and the referee is complete nonsense.
The referee either blows fouls when it's not a foul or when the last guy is tackled in the penalty box, there is no red card nor yellow. It's only a free kick or penalty. This is far from realism. If they manage to fix the referee in this game, I think I can consider this game nearly perfect.

This game is great tho and would recommend it. Especially if you are done spending a ton of money into FIFA, since PES is much more playable within throwing dollars at it.

15,eFootball PES 2020,55550402,english,"Had to change my review after playing more. The AI scores nine free kicks out of ten, the player rating system is absolute crap, it's impossible to score from outside the box (except free kicks) because every goalkeeper is a freaking superman, the loose ball bug just got worse after the patch that was supposed to fix it, the commentary is extremely boring and a million times worse than FIFA's, BAL is the same crap I described in the original review, no custom ML managers. The only good things are the graphics, edit mode and mods (like Scoreboard Server).

So, if you don't absolutely HAVE to play football yourself, don't buy PES or FIFA, just buy Football Manager. If you really want to play yourself, wait for a sale or play an old FIFA. In its current state this game is not worth its price.

Original review:
Better than FIFA no doubt. Great realism and the match gameplay itself is fantastic but Become a Legend has disappointed me. The manager starts me in every single match, never rests me, even if I'm not my team's best player in my position. The whole mode makes no sense unless you're realistically a first squad player in your team. I'm disappointed by this because BAL was my main reason to buy this game, but in reality BAL is almost not any better than FIFA's player career.
So yes, I recommend this game, but not if you want to play a player career. For that, as far as I know, there is no good game.",1570794200,1572169975,FALSE,0,0,0.491560668,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,100,15,11799,0,4310,1599230580

1. There is practically no difference to PES 2018 , you pay half a hundred pretty much for nothing
2.

31,eFootball PES 2020,55644017,english,"I so very much wanted to love this game, but quite honestly I can't say that I would recommend anybody to buy this game at this price point.
PES is still very much a game that has a lot of potential, but somehow it simply can't tap into it correctly. What do I mean by that? The game has a nice slower pace to it than FIFA, which feels a lot more realistic. The problem with PES gameplay however is that you feel very much out of control so much of the time. That is mostly because of defense - player switching is utterly broken and does not work properly, 50% of the time you switch to the wrong person. More importantly however, defense itself is almost impossible to play, tackling still feels so out of control and when the opponent strings a few passes together then because of the slow player switching you can't defend against themselves yourself which in turn means that they will do whatever they want, as AI is simply totally useless in defense for you. If you don't play with them, then they won't do anything, they won't fight for the ball and they won't even take the ball if it comes straight at them.

Similar things lead to problems in offense, if the pass goes a little off, then the player is unable to react to it and get it, this leads to the most frustrating turnovers in possession I can remember from a recent football game. More importantly however, it is almost impossible to do any kind of dribbling because all the players feel so very slow on the ball because of the lack of responsiveness you get from your input. This leads to simple frustration in gameplay.

Third, most obvious problem in gameplay, is fouls and bookings. It seems like the system does not understand what animation it is showing, so many times there simply ain't a foul but you get a booking or something. The frustrating part is that bookings are absolutely utterly inconsistent, similar situations may lead to anything from no foul to a red card. Some humoongous fouls I've done have garnered no attention from the ref, while other fouls have lead to a straight red card even though there is nothing to the foul. What is also frustrating, is that you can do intentional fouls if you want to do a standing tackle, I still have to reinforce, why not just give a separate button for that?!?

All in all, the menus have had the tiniest amount of improvement and are still stuck in late 2000s - the way how the menus are built up, simply don't make sense and I've had so many times, I keep looking for the most basic stuff and I can't find it in a logical place. This game is one of those you really want to love, but you simply can't.

There are no substantial improvements from the last game, there is a lack of licenses, frustrating menus which annoy the heck out of me while doing anything, incl. modding, there is a surprising lack of gameplay depth in terms of difficulty (in 10 hr having not played PES since 2017, I'm already playing at Super Star level) and moreover the gameplay is super-frustrating, heavy and uncontrallable.

- Would recommend if you are tired of FIFA, and want something new

- Passing in the game is perfect and very intelligent.
- Attacking in the game is also very fun and always different, no same thing that works over and over
- The game has very challenging gameplay at first but when you master it, it feels so rewarding

Bad:

- Some minor issues in my opinion with defending, for example many random balls in the box that defenders just sit and watch
- A tad pay to win game, (my club) Ronaldo, Messi are headaches, and you will play them often

Who will know that Konami can make a game even worse than the last one. At demo,  game play seem almost perfect, it is actually what I want all along but for some reason Konami design to change some elements in the game and when it release, it feel I it is another game for me. The game play is on another level of broken, it is more broken than 2019 combine with FIFA19. How can u make almost the same game but more broken that ever before like this.

Enough with shit talk. Before anyone who read this will call me a hater, let me say that I am a PES fan and I play this game more than 100 hours so please open your mind at least a bit. In this review, I will only cover the problem with on field game play and Bot so let start with on field experience first.

When 2019 release, there are a shit ton of problems and in this year Konani design to upgrade it into a fuck ton of problems. I would say Konami never disappointed me once. 
The major problem that I consistent face is a power bar never seem to work the same in every time, I use to push a power into kicking, include passing and shooting, around 70-80% but each time result never seem like the same at all, sometime it go shortly and some time it go so far that nobody reach that pass. I fully understand that there are many factor that need to be consider such as position of player but even if I use the same player, passing in the same direction to the same player, it still so different in each time. 
Next is first touch problem. in the world of actual football, I never see any player even GK receive a ball and the ball go up over their head or it go up, hit the chest and fall into no man's land then they lost a chance to score or lose possession. It happened a lot in this game, I couldn't remember how many time it happened. As the same, there are so many factor to consider but if I try to do what ever I can think of to touch the ball right and it still happened more then 10 times per game then I don't know is it my fall or not.
Another problem is about player reaction. They react to everything that happened around them too slow, for example when the ball go near to them they will just stand right there do nothing, they not even move. Sometime when I pass the ball to another player they will just walk and look the ball pass by right nothing happened.
Pressing is useless in this game. There are so many time that I try to press opponent, both manual press and auto press, it doesn't seem to work. My player will just run into opponent and some how he will end up behind opponent almost every time, else if another possibility is I got foul, and last possibility is I successfully tackle the ball and then it went back to another opponent player. 
Dribble in this game is not respond at all. I didn't want dribble in this game to be like FIFA, I do like this type of dribble for some reason, I am ok with it for very long time but in this game I don't know why do they make it even more difficult to dribble than before. In the last game and in the demo it is fine but they change it when the game release. The finesse dribble is perfect in demo but it is not respond at all in the full game, i never try to use it anymore.
Hit box of player is still broken. There are so many time that I make tackle and my player foot doesn't hit opponent at all but some how I got foul from that. Also, there are time the opponent make a tackle and it is clearly hit my player before the ball but some how they got away with that with no foul at all, ref is not even make play on sign. I have a fuck ton of replay for this.

For a bot, I would say it is better that the last year, I don't have much to say about a bot since I am not a great player or anything like that, I am just a normal dude with no talent. But there are 1 problem that is so annoying, it make me frustrating every single time it happened which is every single bot dribble like Messi. I use to experience every single bot dribble pass my player with incredible dribble skill, they use all of skill in the game and I couldn't do anything to stop them since I can't make a tackle. And when I say every single bot I mean it even GK can do that. The point I try to make is why CB or GK can dribble like that, if u play this game with bot, I dont recommended u to buy this game at all, u have to face this situation once for a while.

In conclusion, Konami manage to make the same game even worse than the last year and they try to fool us with proper demo. For anyone who already buy this game, I feel sad for u bor. I write this shitty review to hopefully rescue at least one poor soul who thinking about buying this game and some how happen to my review.

Konami might be sending the free copies of PES to shitty youtubers, but I need no free copy.
I have more money than most of these fks in KOnami anyway.

So, is it wotrh it? Firstly, check my PES 2019 review. I stated it is garbage, I stand corrected, it is garbage powered by two.
I have to say I am only reviewing single player. I am not interested in MP at all. So FO if you are multiplayer type.

PES 2020 is better game than PES 2019, by far. It is drastically better, but do not forget - PES 2019 was and is a garbage game.
So, is PES 2020 garbage? No, it is not. It is good but not more than good.

Yesterday was playing Juve vs Bologna. PC controlled Bologna. 91% of passing accuracy. Bologna. They never had 60% of accuracy, they are mediocre Italian club. I still do not see clear differences between Ronaldo in Juve and SHITANDO or whatever is his name in Bologna. Just a minor advantages.

Except cheating and passing like Xavi Hernandez, PES dramatically improved on every single level.

It is a good game and worth a try. I actually think it is much better than FIFA, which is also garbage btw. Especially last 2 years. Same  FIFA repacked and sold to morons who need to have the newest one.

This is WORTH A BUY, with score 7/10. Much much better than PES 19.
Come on Konami, you can do it better.

53,eFootball PES 2020,55499416,english,"[h1]Comprehensive Comparison of PES and FIFA[/h1]

Let me start by saying, that [b]I have been a religious FIFA player since FIFA 09.[/b] FIFA has been my #1 most played game by far over the last decade. I, like many others, have grown tired of EA's continued b***s***, and this year I decided to actually do something about it, and give PES a chance. This is my very first PES title, and actually my first ever non-FIFA soccer title.

That being said, I am going to try to compare my experience so far in PES to FIFA, in as many detailed categories as possible, grading each game and explaining which title excels at what, in my personal opinion.

[b][u]1. Graphics[/u] 
[b]Winner?    PES[/b][i]...but barely[/i]
Let's not kid ourselves, no one is complaining about FIFA's graphics. That being said, if you take the time to get the data packages, PES's graphics are such a breath of fresh air, from the same graphics in FIFA's previous 3 or 4 titles. Celebrations, animations, and fine details are all on point. I very rarely find something out of place on screen, that takes away from the realism of the game like I do when playing FIFA. The movement of players feels realistic, compared to the feeling of players being on skates with FIFA. The only department that I could say needs work in PES, is obviously better stadiums, and stadium ambiance (backgrounds, fans,ect.) 

[b][u]2. Audio & Commentary[/u] 
[b]Winner?   FIFA[/b][i]... by a landslide[/i]
I will start by saying that I do enjoy the songs that are on PES's soundtrack. That is the last good thing I will say about PES's audio. The very first match, I found the audio quality of the commentary team (Peter Drury and Jim Beglin)to be refreshing. By the second match, I had already heard one phrase three separate times. They make no remark if a ball goes off the post, will tell a random side story in the middle of a counterattack, and repeat the same phrases towards the end of nearly every match. It is tiresome. I am not advocating for FIFA's commentary, by any means. But it is marginally better than PES's, for now. FIFA's soundtrack also takes the cake here, being four times the size (104 to PES's measly 25) and also being, well just better. Looks like FIFA can keep the crown of best video game soundtrack, for now. 

[b][u]3. Career Mode[/u]
[b]Winner?   PES[/b][i]...but barely[/i]
Career mode is the main reason I play FIFA or soccer games in general. I do enjoy online play, but most of my play time comes from Career mode. So you bet, the first thing I did after finishing the data packages, was to start a career with Fulham to get to the Prem. [b]OH BOY[/b] am I having so much fun with it. Managing finances is fun, I enjoy the way training, and skill training is done. I enjoy being able to play as Diego Maradona or Johan Cruyff. I especially enjoy the stat tracking, and the ability to take part in Europa league (assuming you have the data packs). The biggest thing for me, is that I've yet to experience a single bug. As we all know, FIFA's career mode is still bug-ridden, and has been for years with little change.

[b][u]4. Ultimate Team/My Team[/u]
[b]Winner?   PES[/b][i]...but barely[/i]
This one was difficult for me. And at the end of the day, PES gets the edge for me, soley for being [i]only less[/i] pay-to-win than FIFA is. There are several changes to PES's version of UT. There are several good ideas littered in, such as the way PES does chemistry (known as Team Spirit). It focuses on positions, play-styles, your managers tactics, and player's ability to match these tactics, instead of coming from nationalities or leagues played in. The scout and agent system results in a much fairer allocation of decent players (I have spent 10$, and played roughly 10 matches of ranked online, and I have packed Ronaldo, several other 85+ players, a classic Ronaldinho, ect. It is not nearly as gamble based as FIFA is, if you put in a few dollars into the game, and spend your coins the right way, you can eventually get a decent team, guaranteed. It is however, more difficult to find specific players, however this matters less with the change in chemistry systems. My biggest complaint with PES's Ultimate team, is that it feels, I don't know, incomplete? Maybe I am spoiled with FIFA's squad building challenges, tournaments, and events. But other than playing ranked online matches, there seems to be a lack of actual things to do in PES's My Team. I'm still going to give it the edge, however because it does not feel scripted, and hasn't been completely ruined by micro-transactions. Yet. 

[b][u]5. Online play[/u]
[b]Winner?   FIFA[/b][i]...but barely[/i]
I wanted to give this to PES. FIFA has become so scripted lately that it legitimately isn't fun playing online. And I would probably give this to PES; If, that is, people actually played it. I struggle finding matches at all hours of the day. The only consistent mode I've been able to get a match, is on My Team's ranked mode. Lag isn't really an issue, but having to wait so long for a match is always a pain, no matter what game you are playing. Sadly this seems like a paradox, but until FIFA players migrate to this game, FIFA will still be the go-to for playing an online match.

[b][u]6. Overall Gameplay & Football Realism[/u]
[b]Winner?   PES[/b][i]...by a landslide[/i]
This is the category I've been waiting for. This category is the reason I cannot put PES down. It just feels so, right? Gone are the days of skating through opponents like they're ghosts. Gone are the days of being able to wack a pefectly scripted belter in to the upper 90, when your opponents back is to goal from outside the box. Tactics are actually tactics. The players actually do what you want them to. The best way I can describe this, is that in FIFA, you control 1 player at a time, and the ai controls the other 10 on your team. In PES, your tactics control the other 10 players you don't control. They hold their line where you tell them. They press if you want to press. They park the bus if you tell them to park the bus. Fouls feel real, like real, coliding bodies. My [b]ONLY[/b] complaint with PES's realism, is that I think I have yet to see a single injury, for either side, in every game I've played. Otherwise, It is such a nice breath of fresh air to EA's ""arcade soccer"" as I'm now calling it. This will be enough to keep me off of FIFA 20 for the remainder of this year, I think. 

[b][u]FINAL VERDICT:     PES[/u][i]...but barely[/i]
Disclaimer: I am really mad at EA. I'm tired of what they as developers have done to so many good franchises. Unfortunately, they are here to stay. So the best we as a fanbase can do, is show them that we won't put up with everything. Me purchasing PES this season, instead of FIFA, is my way of telling them that. I understand the game, and change, will not be welcome by everyone.
[b] But if you, like me, are tired of FIFA giving you the same game every single year, I promise that this year's PES will be a nice change that will keep you entertained if you keep an open mind.[/b]

77,eFootball PES 2020,55290778,english,"This review is done after 1 full season of Master League (I mainly play Master League and Local Coop Match)

Summary:
Recommended, the feel of the game and the animation is way better than FIFA IMO (i play both FIFA 18 and FIFA 19) 

Pros:
- Gameplay is very good/realistic, animation were outstanding, and no random glitches so far
- Less physical contact allowed than FIFA (FIFA body contact was like NFL), heading was less effective as well except on a clear opportunity
- Developing Player in Master League is very good, you can add trait, training is very flexible, and change their playstyle to suit your game plan
- Team Role in Master League is good, giving a veteran player more valueable than before.
- Editing player number in Master League is very easy

Cons:
- Goalkeeper reaction was slow if chaotic condition happened in front of the goal
- Difficult to change player when a lose ball happened (generally on offense when a missed pass occured)
- Managing player in master league is quite confusing, because it has so many sub menu for player management
- Commentary is more or less the same since PES 2016
- Dynamic Cutscene without audio, really bad
- Master League do not track player's attribute growth in detail
- Cannot play in offline mode",1569518089,1569774253,TRUE,3,1,0.508684874,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,255,10,21892,361,1475,1601993894
78,eFootball PES 2020,55330455,english,"The demo was great, almost a masterpiece regarding gameplay, but the full release is a completely different game. Ok, I got used to it, I had fun playing it, even when I was beaten heavily. It was a generally fine game.
But gameplay became totall f*ck*d up this thursday. Don't try to tell me that it's normal that I won 17 games out of 20 before thursday (myclub rating above 850), and I have literally ZERO wins since then. My players went full retard, the game is totally out of my control, and it doesnt matter which manager I play with, there's no difference on the pitch. My attackers just stand in one place, waiting for a pass that never comes, because even De Bruyne can't make a good pass from 10 meters. The ball control of my players became awful, the opponent chases me down and gets the ball before it reaches my attacker, but on the opposite side my defenders just watch the striker from 5 meters away, letting them do ping-pong passes.
I could continue it till next week, a lot of threads are about the scripting, which makes the game simply unplayable. I'm a PES player since PES3, and it's the first time that I seriously consider quitting the series, because I never felt so scammed and disappointed like this right now.

Regarding PES 2020, I was initially mesmerized by the graphic of the game. However, as time goes by, the gameplay hugely bugged me mainly in terms of referee and AI.

1. Referee is simply a joke as a minor bump to an opponent can result to a foul and even a weird yellow card. This really destroys gameplay as tackle feels useless so what i started doing is simply hold X to take the ball out of an opponent feet and this is annoyingly boring.

2. Regarding AI, most of the time they would let a simple ball pass goes through them . Even if you decide to manually control the player and direct it towards the direction of the ball, he would stupidly still let the ball through.

So, i guess it's time to give FIFA 20 a try and hope to not get disappointed again *fingers crossed*",1569225445,1569225445,FALSE,4,0,0.501029611,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,30,1,682,0,662,1569935201

PROS:
1. The graphics and effects have few more details, the 3D feeling while playing is great. 
2. Now you must play more in the middle field and use more your players if you want to success in the offence. 
3. They recovered some soccer leagues that were gone in the previous year.
4. Some additional options while customizing your Master league at the beginning.
5. The COM uses and changes the advance strategies according to the game situation, and it has slightly improvements in its gameplay.  


CONS
1. The referee is bad programmed, as consequence, is frustrating.
2. IA controlled players don't react to the ball when it passes close to them, even very close. 
3. There are almost not chances to play first touch with the ball, for KONAMI the player first needs to control the ball and then execute the command that you ordered. 
4. There are still sliders in the game, and they change for bad depending on the match relevance. 
5. The game has horrible issues with choosing the player who will receive the ball or who will defend, in some cases I saw that it doesn't obey the pad direction.

4,eFootball PES 2020,55179374,english,"Alright, first of all, this is not PES 2020.
""PES 2020 DEMO"" was the actual PES 2020. This is rather PES 2019.5.

I think Konami just made it clear that they don't want us to have their best work. Because whatever they did on the demo, it's so obvious that it's been reverted.

[b][i]This is PES 2019 all over again, and in some cases, it's even worse than PES 2019: 	[/i][/b]

[b]1[/b]- Refereeing is the worst ever. They call fouls on easy contacts and ignore actual fouls for some reason.

[b]2[/b]- Dribbling is dead. Even tho they introduced finesse dribbling and sh!t, the dribbling is dead. #RIP. Because you can't even use the finesse dribbling, you have literally no time to use it. Just like the previous years, playing with high pressure is the key in this game and when you get the ball or pass it to another player, 1 or 2 or maybe even 3 opponent players will run like horses towards you. Most of the time they will knock you down and get the ball without a foul just like I said earlier. It's like all the opponents you face are the same guy. Unbelievable. Plus you can't even dribble with basic controls anymore. Because I don't know, it won't work. Your opponent's player will stretch his leg and block you somehow. Even if you trick them by changing your direction suddenly, it won't work. Your opponent will get the ball by pressing only 1 ret4rded button. It's a no brainer seriously, defending system has to change.

[b]3[/b]- Last year, the script was the worst ever. But hey, it turns out it can be even worse, lol. Get ready to concede 90th+ minute goals while you are leading by 1 goal, get ready to draw after the 76th minute even if you are up 4-0. Yep, you heard it right.

[b]4[/b]- Intercepting passes manually is impossible. Even if you read your opponent's movements and take action before them, your players will watch the ball go through most of the time. Utter bullsh!t.

[b]5[/b]- Along with defending, also supercancelling is broken atm.

PES 2020 DEMO was miles ahead of this garbage final code.

[b][i]Other than those above:	[/i] [/b]

[b]1[/b]- Commentary is still the same. Although I noticed that they've added some different dialogues, it's still not enough. And those dialogues have diferent tone so it's obvious they're different and kinda annoying.

[b]2[/b]- The UI is still garbage. Just as I mentioned last year, in-game menus are like endless. They don't know how to organize stuff properly and effectively in a single screen. After you complete a match, you have to press X like 10 times. It's even more if you play a match in ""What's On"" Mode. You have to leave the tournament page manually whether you win or lose and if you lose, there is still no RE-ENTER COMPETITION option and you have to come all the way back from the fkn main menu.
In addition, new squad list page is garbage, there isn't enough information on players and everything is so big.
Similar to that, trading page is also trash. Again, everything is so big unnecessarily and the listing system is idiotic. Let's say you have 3x Mustafi. Those Mustafis will be listed separately from each other. I mean, why? Just list 1 Mustafi and add a number next to him like x3. But no, they'll list all those mfers so people have to scroll down forever. At least we were able to press right arrow key to skip pages in previous years but we can't even do that anymore.

[b]3[/b]- Replay system is a failure for years. They either don't know or dont want to develop stuff. Did you score a fantastic goal in late? Well my dude go press X 50 times so you can see it and save it.

[b]4[/b]- Speaking of the replay system, we still can't save the matches we play. Why?

[b]5[/b]- Lag-cheating obviously still exists since the matchmaking is still p2p. Well, let's be honest here, it will exist forever, right... Unless Elon Musk's global internet provides incredibly fast connections to everywhere on the planet, maybe then Konami would think about building actual servers, lol.

[b]The only thing good in this game is probably the Master League. If you gonna play offline, go buy it.
As for online, long story short, this game is garbage, a heavy scripted game where horses play tennis.	[/b]
Hence we can simply call this horsesh!t game as ""eTennis, Pro Evolution Script"".

p.s. don't let my playtime fool you tho, I mostly simulate matches in MyClub to farm GP while I'm playing something else (mostly WoW Classic nowadays but hell I even forget about it often and it just stays idle lol) so I can get some of my favourite players and use them in co-op which I play rarely with a friend.",1568873633,1569078536,FALSE,55,2,0.741907239,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,97,5,78432,0,4780,1600006263
5,eFootball PES 2020,55214381,english,"Well for an ex fifa player this game dissapointed me a lot! In the demo the gameplay was so good! until the patch that made the game faster like fifa and my god it's awful! I can't dribble 2 meters without getting harshly tackled and not given a foul by the AI It's literally awful! Even when you start dribbling a shite team can easily heavily press you like Liverpool do it's awful! Bloody awful! And to make it worst you can't ping pong (Which is good) But at the same time you're forced to ping pong at times because even when u pass to a player you get heavily pressed and if you don't pass quick enough you'll lose the ball.

Another shit thing is that the AI's passing is so good and it'll rip through your defense like it's nothing. Even if you chase the players and win the ball like the AI does your players will get tired faster (Which is a good thing) But at the same time the game is forcing you to do what the AI does in order to get the ball back.

Tacking will get the other team a foul and a yellow card so it's like u press S and hope that the player will get the ball. Honestly it's ruined for me

So what do I like about this game? Shooting (Shooting in my opinion is very well done, shots that should go in go in unlike FIFA 19 where 1 v 1's are 100% gonna get saved)

I like that also in myclub when you spend money you get a quality player, unlike fifa which gives you a shit 82 rated that's not gonna sell for more then 4K on the market meaning you'll get ripped off. However on PES when you spend you get! I got Mbappe the first pack I got when I spend coins.

I sorta regret it as I won't really be playing this game due to the shit gameplay it now has. And I regret spending yet another 60 euros on a football game, something I won't be doing anymore!

Unless you like what I mentioned then yeah buy it but PLEASE STAY AWAY IT'S JUST AS BAD AS FIFA ONLY A TINY BIT BETTER BUT STILL DOESN'T JUSTIFY!

6,eFootball PES 2020,55212410,english,"Just trying to provide a 'headsup' for any old school PES 6 fans like myself who got sucked in. This game is broken at present, please do not go for it. Maybe patches will fix some of these, but if you play against the CPU mainly (i.e. Master League) just don't do it to yourself. 

Game breaking issues: 
This game is genuinely broken, in a way that makes me wonder if we could sue for a refund. There are magical, wonderous things in it which clearly got my attention, but it's fundamentally flawed in such a way as to render any long term playing impossible (unless severely patched). Note I only play against the CPU, so maybe Konami would waive off concerns as immaterial to their business model. But, as someone who has been around a LONG time:

1. Your 'second' teammate literally doesn't respond to the ball. I've had so many situations where a teammate is within touching distance of the ball, both on offence and defence, and they just stand there, as if unsure what their name is and how they came to be on a football pitch at that moment.
2. The delay when using advanced throughball makes it utterly useless. Like, worse than any football game I've ever played, for 3 decades.
3. There is painfully clear scripting on long balls about which player is going to get there first, to an almost comical level where the little legs of a Daniel James are moving in slow motion relative to the immense speed of a Mustafi.
4. Every single match I concede a goal which is the product of the only CPU move I've actually seen: midfield you can't get near plays it into the feet of the striker (who has previously been left by your AI CB) who waits for you to switch to the defender, reads which way you're moving, goes the other and scores. It's incredible that someone thought we wouldn't notice (jokes on me to be fair).
5. There is a magneticism to the ball which only applies to the CPU. They get within a few feet of your player with the ball, and it kicks off a tackle/stumble animation. Whereas I've had shots and passes appear to travel through my players who are on top of the opponent. It's worse if there's a deflection and you're desperately trying to get your player to 'glue' onto the ball.",1569063457,1569063457,FALSE,6,0,0.495112717,1,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,101,3,513,30,316,1602033587

The scripting in this in game is so obvious is embarrassing. I'm playing Become a Legend (BAL) [I don't care of online features] and the referee calls foul for opposite team every time without being a foul. Meanwhile I get fouled many times referee never calls it even that obvious foul. My player is 99 in everything[ *is experimental offline build in order to  verify the theory that scripting does not  consider numbers at all ], and just get called in game from the bench with full stamina, and the opposite defender which stamina is fully depleted can not only catch up multiple times but commits very obvious foul and not even a card from referee or call it a foul. This game has become a joke, a shadow of itself. The scripting has make the game embarrassing. They have implemented heavy scripting in order for people to spend more money buying cards and for the beginners to get to buy cards. Scripting is in place to make people spend is so obvious. Konami has become a total greedy joke, as EA with Adam Bhatti copying Fifa point by point in scripting and marketing and in game sales techniques. Beside that BAL has no changes not even any single upgrade let alone a full lifting, every year is the same vapid game. Total focus on online features and in game purchases as Fifa does, forgetting BAL totally. Also they have brought back political correctness and studio politics instead of having a true sim leaving politics out. Is this a game of football or game about studio politics? There are so many wrong things with this game, is not even funny no more. Has become a total joke. Being a fan of simulator based games, I use to think FIfa was a joke arcadish, greedy, politically correct story with no potion to customize from scratch a player or give us a  real existing player in world, online focus most of the game, super aggressive marketing with most of founds going there, but now PES is right there is the lost twin of Fail FIFA. PES use to be proper simulator until 2013, 
 PES 2014 was the beginning of BS, from than everything went downhill.


And I do have plenty of replays to confirm how many times the  referee totally ignores fouls committed from opposite defenders. Just recently had a a replay of opposite defender hitting straight the leg, and not even close to the ball. No foul. Is just one of those moments that you go : WTF are you serious? Look at this BS. Not once but In repetition.

[  If anyone knows how to post replays here I would appreciate if they help me out]  [otherwise check out my replay to prove it] I'm going to save every time in replay how many times it happen in single game.

No more will your non-controlled players ignore the loose ball right in front of them. No more will the AI attempt to score from crosses 90% of the time. This year the football feels vastly more realistic. Passes from the off-foot, off balance, on the run, or in an off-direction are no longer precision. You will lose possession a lot. And the AI will lose possession a lot. Good scoring chances are few and far between. Last year I had the match length at 10 minutes in order to achieve realistic scoring levels. This year so far I'm at 20 and thinking I could probably push to 30. The ball feels properly weighted and the ball physics are improved. The player animations are on another level compared to last year. This is a big step forward and Konami seem to be listening to the community feedback as well.

I prefer games that I can sink 40-80 hours into and there's no doubt this is one of those titles - particularly when the option files are completed and we can play with licensed franchises/teams. This is my first soccer game on the PC (preferred way to play now that I have a daughter that uses my primary tv) and it's been fun to date. I did not play the demo beforehand - which seems to be where a large majority of the negative reviews are coming from.

39,eFootball PES 2020,55126579,english,"TLDR: The game is deeply flawed. After making an amazing PES19, Konami was set to create a masterpiece but they have receded to absolute trash quality AI with this game. I mostly play offline against AI and PES used to be the gold standard for it but this year tackling, passing, and pressing..the main three ways to control any match are absolutely broken.

Players like Thiago and Iniesta will regularly misplace 80% of their passes(no matter what pass assist level you have). So you give away the ball and try to win it back, right? Wrong! You can try double pressing with another player but the CPU will not yield the ball and when it does..WHISTLE..a foul is called without fail. 
On the other hand, CPU AI will make fifa 18 style bee-sting tackles that will take the ball over from you and place it in a perfect place for the CPU to attack. It's ridiculous how blatant this is. Also, after a tackle your player will be in a weird ragdoll timeloop where he will flail about whilst the CPU regains possession. And if you ever make a tackle near your penalty box, its a guaranteed foul. 

Pressing: Is not dysfunctional, its outright broken. Check out the video on youtub3 titled ""Horrible Defending and AI PES 2020"". The author of the video covers cases where your defenders actually recede away from the ball instead of attacking it from clearance. In the penalty box, your players will suffer with extreme paralysis and tunnel vision. Instead of going for the loose ball, they actually back away as if a ticking bomb is going to go off inside the football. PES 19 had some issues here and there but this PES is absolutely broken with your midfielders not even attempting to trap the ball, they just walk past the ball and somehow CPU is in Klopp-mode Gegenpress to just intercept the ball and make a run at your defence. No amount of advanced settings such as Gegenpress or Swarm the box will fix this issue.

Tackling: The problem was rampant in the demo but I saw some twitter threads raising this issue. So I assumed Konami will fix it but good lord, they have made it worse. Almost 70% of your tackles will result in a foul, no matter what angle even if you win the ball. This simply destroys the flow of the match, almost penalizing you for trying to have the ball. The problem is exaggerated bbut the fact that most of your passes will be misplaced so you'll have to tackle a fair bit to try to win the ball back.And these issues occur at everything from Beginner to Superstar.

General feel: Your Messi won't be able to control a simple pass, however, Ben Mee can tackle him perfectly, take over the ball and push forward like a De Ligt regen, whilst Messi is left in an uncontrollable daze for about 3 seconds and absolutely unable to track back and press him. It's just unbelievable how having players like Thiago, Messi, Ronaldinho and Iniesta in MyClub makes a 65 rated team of silver-balls look like Pep's Barcelona. This isn't a one-off issue of getting tackled at high pace, your players will be unable to control the ball and take upto 2-3 seconds to make a pass on a half-turn. The players I have mentioned above are possibly 4 of the best ball-controllers in real life but in this game they play like a sunday league team. What's the point of rating a 85+ ball control on Thiago Alacantra then?

Other PES issues remain, every darn screen to screen switch takes 5 seconds, the whole menu needed a re-work of flow, not just replacing the icons in place of the different screens.

Adding videos to Master League isn't going to help if the whole menu for Master league is so trash, slow and hard to tell which option you even have highlighted. Hard to understand Konami can't hire someone over the age of 7 to design this stuff? It's been like this for the last half a decade really. But no, they'd rather spend money on putting Johan Cryuff's face on your manager instead of ensuring they nearly half the time isn't spent staring at dark screens between transitions.

PES19 for all its smaller flaws remains a much superior game. PES2020 feels like it's gameplay wasn't even beta-tested. Slapping eFootball to the title wouldn't do any good if core gameplay is fundamentally broken.

Cons :Misplaced passes, horrible tackling logic, Players feel lethargic, non-agile and can't control the football
Pros: Shooting is very satisfying when you score a goal it doesn't feel like a slingshot

44,eFootball PES 2020,55121716,english,"Worst 50 Euro spent on Steam EVER. Do NOT buy this game. 

I took a break for 3 years from playing football games, and Ive placed a pre-order after playing the demo which I really liked, the game seemed really fun. This was a big mistake if you liked the demo do not think the full game is the same, actually it got way worse. 

The AI of your players in this game is pretty non existant. An opposition pass goes into your player? it will just hit him and go 10 meters away in a random direction, oh a ball is 30 cm off your feet? ah just let it pass - ball is lava, wow theres a pass to an opossition player next to me nah let him just run, goalkeeper has a shot flying at him with a turtle speed? Let me punch it in front of me of course theres a striker to finish that, balls goes so high so  the goalkeeper is the only player who can simply catch it? He will just punch it to a corner, your player has 90 ball control? his first touch is heavier than the ones in 5th Russian league, and many many many many more annoying things.

This game has so many bugs and such a crappy AI of your players that if you want to play online, then dont do it to yourself and dont buy this ""football"" game, probably in Master League vs COM it might be fun, but online play for this is just pure random. Im having a record of 15 wins 1 draw and 8 loses, and most of those came randomly. Either I had a lot chances in a game but nothing hit the net, but then my defenders just decide to go for a walk, and boom 0-1. And on the other hand I had games where I did nothing the whole game still I won because of some bullshit play of the game.

Im really feeling bad that Steam doesnt allow for a return after 2hrs were played, after 5hours Ive been sure I would give this back, and that those 50 euros spent were the worst spending of my life.
The menus have such a bad UI that you will spend a lot of that time in there, searching for something really obvious. 

And at last but not the least the myClub mode which I bought this game for, this mode has actually no point of playing it. Obtaining best players is fairly easy, you'll end up with the likes of Messi, Mbappe, Ronaldo, and other 90+ players fairly quickly, but wow the game wont let you use them pretty much because of contract costs, but even taking that contract costs away. This game WILL punish you if you want to play a lot. Simply because the contract costs are so high, the best way to play this game would be playing 1 game per day to get win bonus lol.

Okay so you go for silver players so you afford playing this, cool idea, but hey stop obtaining those is pretty ass because you need to search for some scouts do some combo wombos and maybe you'll get a player you would like to use. Lets say you want Moise Kean - so you search for some specific scout cards to get him fairly easy, you can obtain them through auction house, lets say you want Nationality: Italy card with 4*, you go search for it and boom theres non on the market, so you login in 2 hours still nothing like that, so you end up saying to yourself I dont care. 

The ranked games has  near to zero use - even if you win your group the rewards are so low that you paid way more already for playing those games. Tournaments have decent prizes but after you complete it once (pretty much 3 games only required) they wont give you any reward. 

The only great idea here is the leveling up of your players this adds some fun to  level the players you like, but thats all.

Im trully disappointed with this game. It doesnt give fun, it actually makes me mad every time I play it, because of the retarded AI. MyClub has nothing to play for in it,  you want a dream team? Theres no point in that, you want to level up players you like? good luck finding the scouts for them. Generally for me this is a 5/10 game, might be decent in offline, but online its super crap.",1568542804,1568543022,FALSE,75,12,0.706194282,16,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,143,2,3618,0,810,1589627876

Referees are also behaving much sane in this version. The only slight complain is the sluggish defending though I am not sure if it was made that way for better manual control.
Not sure how FIFA 20 is, but generally FIFA is all about TV presentation (like to the cable broadcast) and all the bells and whistles with it but never really about a simulation. All gameplay is fast & arcade based which definitely PES is not. Yet, the lack of licenses is a slight hindrance which can be partially overcome by the option files available all across the PES fan sites.

The pace of the game is closer to real football. Building up an attack and scoring a goal feels so much more satisfying.

They are both going to have their pros and cons when it comes right down to it. But like i said if you care more about the physicality of a football sim more than 'official' kits etc. PES is for you 100%. 

There are endless mods in which you can do some research to obtain the official kits leagues and more licensed features in PES which is great. And as this is a steam review i dont need to mention the lack of modding available on xbox players.

There is some input delay that seems to be on purpose to allow for more mistakes but it makes the game frustrating and causes 
dribbling and tackling to feel slow and unresponsive.

Players controlled by the a.i. for both the CPU and you make strange decisions, such as attacking full-backs staying really deep and midfielders behind defenders. In the demo it felt like there was enough space to run into and pass around but not enough to just walk through it, now it's either no space or too much because of player positioning.

In the demo, you could pressure the CPU into mistakes through pressing, either winning the ball high up the pitch or forcing them into a mistake. Now the CPU doesn't get pressured and every team feels the same and can pass like a prime Barcelona. 
The CPU will always pass rather than dribble. I have not seen any players try any skill moves or take a defender on instead they will pass through. This means you have to play passive and cannot play aggressive. Again in the demo, this wasn't an issue.

If these changes a reverted and are made like the demo this is the best simulation of a football game ever and is close to perfection. 

There are improvements from the demo such as, shooting is now more varied, more physicality, more emotions and animations on the pitch and much-improved heading.

Kick Off, Sensible Soccer, International Super Star Soccer, Actua Soccer, Fifa,m Winning Eleven and PES. FIFA has had the edge in recent years after being behind PES. Now PES 2020 has for now moved ahead of all past football games. The gameplay is fun, the pace is realistic, the attention to detail is absolutely amazing, water splashes on a wet pitch, grass is kicked up when players slide along the floor, sweat pours off the faces of players, the crowd is the best ever in a football games, they are lifelike with different animations. The shirts of the players crease and even the hair is not just a blob of textures and polygons. The AI is not stupid either making some surprise decisions and now doesn't just cut it back or cross it in. Watch our video gameplay and you will see what we mean. The best football game ever made to date!
