I can see the whole backyard. Since these only early access only i can do right now is Building multiple base for the future UPDATE. My plan is Build a lot of Tower in different places. So that i can focus on the New Content Every Month without making a new base nearby. I cant wait for the ZIPLINE. I will put them at the top of my towers. Making a new base is not easy. It took me 10 hours to make a normal Base that have all the utilities inside. Grinding Materials is really hard and tedious job. Chopping weed steam and grass plank is really easy because of the new Mutation perk. Carrying it to the base area is the hard part. You going need atleast 300+ grass planks or weed steam. I want the base 2 floors minimum for utilities and a lot of storage chest. This game going to have a lot of Items.

Until last week I found out it releases on Steam and I was really overwhelm. Played this with my friend for few hours and I think there's still a lot more to explore out there in the wild backyard.

Just a few suggestion that I think could be improved is:
1. Equipped armour should be removed from inventory once you wear it.
2. A compass would be nice addition (perhaps it is already implemented but needed to be unlocked in the game when progress forward, Im still new to this game).
3. Mark a waypoint on the map and can be viewed on HUD.
4. Mark respawn spot or custom point so that we can review back the map what we have explored.
5. Maybe add some human walk by randomly and we need to dodge them.
6. More backyard (eventhough Im still new to this game, saw some review saying they finished all the mission in few hours).

So you start out as 1 of 4 kids (there are 2 boys and 2 girls to choose from) and you are shrunked down to the size of an ant. You also play the game in your backyard with a ton of things to do and find, like building your base or finding pre-made bases around the backyard. I have built a couple bases in different areas and at the moment my latest base that I'm working on is a pyramid base. Also there are a ton of enemies to fight like Ants (worker ants & soldier ants), Lady Bugs, Stink Bugs, Mites, Infected Mites, Infected Weevils, Gnats, Bombardier Beetles, Larvae, Tay-Z (enemy robot), Spiderlings, Orb Weaver Spiders & last but also the most terrifying the Wolf Spider. I give this game a 10 out of 10 and the developers usually have a update out every month. The most recent update added a huge hedge base (pre-made) and zip lines so you can get around the backyard a lot faster and much easier. There is also a friendly robot named Burg-l, who gives you missions to do. You also can find science parts that can upgrade tools, weapons, armor and bases.

The clay seems to be a bit of an issue, though I finally found a good spot. . .if it re-spawns at some point? 
The science points for upgrades seem pretty scarce, but that may be by design. I plan on trying it with some friends at some point. 
When it's all said and done though, I'm actually growing bored at the ten hour mark. Maybe because I can't find what the robot sent me to look for. Something at the end of a red tunnel and down a hole? And something in a jungle ruin? The whole yard is a jungle. . .

0,76971004,english,"Currently, the game is not worth $30. I am sure it will be. It has a lot going for it. And I will change my review when they fix the issues (I know it is early access). 

THE GOOD: As an early access title, it already looks and feels pretty good. Combat is not innovative but it works. Survival mechanics like food water and stamina are not impossible to manage like some survival games. The actual world is super neat looking especially when you get high enough up to get a good look at the yard. The bugs seem a little unbalanced but that is to be expected in early access and so far the patches have been consistent and useful.

THE BAD: The building mechanics are currently god awful and completely pointless. Considering the lack of much to do in the game, I would imagine the base building would be a highlight. Instead, it's an afterthought. You just need a few boxes and a label so you know where to come back and get your items since the bugs do not actually do anything to the boxes when left alone (even on the hardest difficulty). Placing walls, floors, and scaffolding is not intuitive. Parts rarely snap together and your base will ultimately look like a ramshackle mess. Many placed items do not seem to want you on top of them and make your character do a weird falling/floating/slide on top until you slide off (if you know what I mean great, if not i'm sorry I cannot explain it better). Co-op bases are even more useless. If you are not the host, every placed item vanishes... or at least becomes invisible. The box is still THERE... you just cannot see it... so you need to be well aware of where things were initially placed. If you build a tent or bed (respawn point) you must build it outside of your home because if it is INSIDE your building then respawning often glitches you into the ground where you fall into oblivion.",1601735178,1601735178,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True,76561198034746837,427,51,819,394,819,1601344770

Had already a friend that didn't want to play it anymore because of this.

In singleplayer it doesn't happen except that sometimes there is an empty slot in inventory and also the storage chest and when i try to put something in that slot, OR nothing happens, or the item you try to put in that slot, just vanish... But you will never know what slot it could be so. That is a minor bug but yea..

I just wish that, when someone or a company make a game and wants (or must from another company) co-op/multiplayer for that game (no matter if it's for more money or just for more attention or whatever...), why not make that just working, why do stuff have to dissapear and all that nonsense?
Why IF someone finally play a cute game with someone in co-op, the game does things a player totally turned down by. Okay, as long a guest player stays in the game, there is no problem but.... when the host save the game and both log out, go for diner or somethin' and later they return to play further, all stuff is gone for the guest player. That's not fun, totally stab in the back IF players must wait a month (or even longer as they described on their site)
It says: ""Coming soon (These are approximately a few months off)""
source: https://grounded.obsidian.net/feature-board

And without hotfix in between we are left with (yes again), a game that is broken in co-op.

Seems a good way for companies to make a single player game into a co-op game so they can raise the amount of people to buy it, nothing wrong with that but at least give us a working one.

My biggest point of critique right now: The Updates.
The game was released as EA and that is fine. Approx. 20% of the story and 2 Tiers out of 5 regarding weapons and armor were implemented.
Right now we are at approx. 30-40% of the story, which will be laughable if the scope keeps. And we have 2 of 5 Tiers of weapons and armor.
The updates included Fixes (which he had to wait 4 weeks for, as the DevTeam coulnd't be arsed to release faster). And... bird feathers. Yes. In 4 whole weeks, while speculations went for Kois, Mosquitos and Bees, all they accomplished was a bird flying across the yard (it's only rendered, mind you, you can't interact with it) which drops feathers. 
BOOM! BIG THING! THAT'S THE UPDATE!
I am not kidding. 
The second update which dropped just now is even less noteworthy.

All in all, I wouldn't hold my breath for this one.
Treat it like an X release. Wishlist it, forget about it for a year or two. Then check back. Difference is, with X we KNOW it will be better. This one...? I'd refund if I could.",1601547200,1601547200,False,3,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,True,76561198007627088,196,13,1563,0,1563,1596495744

64,76637098,english,"First-off, I'll say that, because this is an early-access game, know that it's buggy, so crashing out of the game, and experiencing other problems can be common. But the devs are a very dedicated team that read the bug reports people post, and are working on fixing these problems, as well as introducing new game content that make the game more exciting. 
In spite of the fact that this game can be buggy, I still recommend Grounded, because there's not so many bugs that it prevents you from having fun; it is an absolutely fantastic game. I've played survival games before, like Subnautica and Ark Survival, but wasn't really into them that much. I looked for other survival games, but never really found any to my taste, so kinda lost interest in the survival game genre for a while. Then I decided to try looking at good reviews my friends had made on games, and found Grounded:

A survival game that, upon looking at the videos and pictures on the store page, immediately caught my attention. because, it was unlike any survival game I had ever seen or experienced, flipping your normal perception of things on its head - instead of being a normal, human-sized character fighting to survive against normal-sized (ish?) opponents, and building normal-sized buildings, this game, Grounded, has you playing as characters that are downsized to the size of an ant, where everything that would seem normal sized and harmless to us is now monstrously huge, or poses a threat - from garden equipment like rakes, weed killer canisters, discarded juice boxes and toys (even food, like an oreo, eww :P), puddles, leaves, human footprints on the ground, feathers (which comes from a crow that flies around in the garden, that, compared to you, is bigger than a T-Rex), down to the plants and grass on the ground. And, of course, the insects, like ants, stinkbugs, larva, spiders, etc. To give you an example, compared to you, grass looks like a forest, spiders are roundabout the same size as Shelob (a spider from the movie Lord-of the Rings, maybe slightly smaller), ants are big enough that they could be ridden, outside ground lights in the garden look like towers, and swimming in the pond feels like you're swimming in a lake.
Because of this, the game can be very scary at times; if you specifically have a phobia of spiders, there's a setting you can adjust to do with arachnophobia, that allows you to change the spiders' appearance - raising the bar/having it at the highest setting, makes them look more scary/keeps them at their original spider-like appearance, while lowering it makes the spider look less like a spider, and, well...comical, to be honest ^_^

Going about collecting resources for multiple things like weapons, armour, tools, and buildings is lots of fun, too:
Tools - You can craft handy tools like axes, hammers, shovels, to help with collecting building materials, or just simply finding small critters that you can hunt for food - the shovel, for instance, is used to unearth grubs in the ground, you can spot their location as a dirt trail moving around on the ground. Axes are used to chop down grass stalks and dandelion weed stems for building materials. 
Building - You can chop down grass stalks and dandelion stems to collect grass planks and weed stems, used to build bases that are made out of grass floors, walls, windows, stairs and ceilings, with frames. New building content, I am absolutely certain, will be introduced in the future with upcoming updates. 
Weapons and armour - You can hunt insects to craft weapons and armour, which each have their own perks. For instance, hunting ants will give you ant armour, which, when worn, will allow you to carry more heavy items at a time (such as grass planks and weed stems); crafting aphid slippers or spider armour will make you run faster; wearing a gas mask will allow you to explore the weed killer area, which is coated in deadly gas; trying to explore it without the mask will cause you to suffocate. 
Utilities - You can craft things like dew collectors (a spider web that produces water droplets over-time for you to drink), a spit where you can roast food (which you can get from hunting little critters like aphids, grubs, gnats, etc.), a jerky stand where you can hang raw meat that, overtime, will turn into meat jerkies that will never spoil and will replenish a very large amount of hunger.
Or simple things like canteens that allow you to scoop up liquid to carry them with you either to drink at the moment or later; or healing items like smoothies (which, when consumed, replenishes your health) or healing bandages, that, when applied also replenishes your health. Very handy to have when you're fighting insects, and are low on health. 

Also, something that makes the game exciting, there's a certain someone you can visit, at any time, to obtain and complete quests, which require you to do a range of things, from hunting certain insects, to crafting a specific weapon, armour, or tool, to collecting little chips (the electronic kind) or building trail marks on recognizable landmarks in the garden, that, when built, will  place a beacon on that landmark that will show up on your map, so you know where to find it again. The chips are something you can give to the one you can get the quests from, which will then unlock upgrades for purchase that will make your gameplay easier and better - for instance, one of them allows torches to burn for longer, another one unlocks new building items, another allows you to scoop a bigger amount of water into your canteen, and - a really good one - one that enables your scanner to be able to detect any raw science in the vicinity when exploring the garden, whenever you come in close range to it. Raw science is something you receive upon completing quests, or from collecting them when exploring in the garden; they look like floating hot pink, glowing orbs. You use this raw science as a currency to purchase the upgrades from the one you get the quests from. Quests, 3 at a time, refresh daily, with every single in-game day, so there's always something different to accomplish, regarding the quests.

It can be hard to find out what to do when you're starting the game, but there's plenty of information on the internet that covers what you need to know in Grounded. And this game is constantly being updated with patch fixes and exciting upcoming game content that improve the game (this game starts with a bit of a story, where you have to find the shrinking equipment. It comes to a halt at some point, but there's hints that it will continue on in coming updates), it's a great game to consider getting! :)",1601181496,1601510012,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True,76561198377738658,20,32,3386,2410,3182,1602072702

Not worth 30€. Veryl ittle content. Maybe worth 10€ at best.

49,76352176,english,"Updated review:

Shrinking down life-sized humans down to ant-sized figures is an innovative idea that has only been seen in movies until a company that was known for classic games like Age of Empire brought it to life. This new genre brings in excitement like never before, and I thought I have seen all that the survival games had to offer.

This tiny game packs a big punch with daily tasks to complete, as well as plenty of nightmarish creatures to kill or most likely, run away from. You can play it together with a group of trusty friends or you can go in solo, like myself, hardcore style. Things get more tense and creepy when you are getting chased down by a bazillion amounts of ants army in complete darkness, but it won't last too long as you will quickly find yourself at the respawn point if you are out-geared, nothing like being mowed down to death by red trap-jaw ants AKA soldier ants in-game. 

Nothing like spending all day scavenging for food and materials only to come back to your base at night facing a giant cluster of ants stealing your goodies right in front of you. Apparently a thin layer of wall made of grass will not stop the ants from taking your valuables so don't build a storage box right next to the walls! 

Ladybugs in this game is very OP, one ladybug can fend off more than a dozen ants, and it's easy to bring the aggro on to the ladybug, as it will auto attack once it takes a hit. Riding on the ladybug and watch it kill off all the ants is a great experience.

I [b]do[/b] love the game [b]but[/b] there is still a lot of work to be done by the developers.

The game feels very solid in single player mode, apart from the infrequent crashes sometimes. This changes quite a lot (in my experience) when going multiplayer. To name a few:
[list]
[*] Desyncs (items/players/npc's not on same place in everyone's game)
[*] Drinking juice producing gigantic lag
[*] a (kind of) duplication glitch with the weapon rack
[*] walking on grass planks makes your screen go all jumpy
[/list]
The game feels unpolished at these points, but also [i]because[/i] of these bugs i've had a lot of fun with friends in this game. Aim for someone's head with grass planks, miss because of desync, and discover that everyone in game sees you missing because you are the one desynced...

However, I do still recommend it. Why? Because i have high hopes for this game. I think they've shown a lot of content already, and content-wise this game is pretty solid to me. They need to work out all the kinks and bugs [i](badum tsss)[/i], and i'm pretty confident they will do that. The only thing i will say to you before buying is: [b]Step into it with an open mind.[/b]

[h2]Edit 2020/09/23:[/h2]
I no longer recommend it. Update 0.2.2 made my experience way more buggy than my last playthrough. In one hour i experienced the following:
[list]
[*] 2 Disconnects without any reason
[*] 1 crash
[*] Spawning through floor and falling
[*] ... to force leave, only to come back and see your backpack still falling
[*] ... while your friend sees your backpack right in front of him
[*] Items that are suddenly gone from inverntory
[*] Chests or other placeables that are in another place when returning from exploring
[*] Getting stuck in walls or other non-obvious small boundaries
[*] [spoiler]Crawling into the mint box doesn't work anymore, it used to work just fine[/spoiler]
[*] Server desyncs and rubberbanding, or complete skipping of parts of your exploration
[/list]

Yes, i know this is still EA. But i expected bugs to be fixed, especially since we are now a whole minor update further since my last review (0.1.2 -> 0.2.2).

62,74896786,english,"In its current state, I recommend Grounded if it's on sale.

My boyfriend brought this game up to me last week and the ""Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"" vibes really piqued my interest. I love games like The Forest, Green Hell, and Raft, so this seemed like a no-brainer to me. The only regret I have is not reading a lot of the reviews because I think I would have waited had I known I was spending $30 on something that I can't quite pinpoint if it's in its pre-Alpha or Alpha stage. There's not much content here yet, so keep that in mind if you're itching to buy.

What [i]is[/i] here, however, shows a lot of promise and I'm very hopeful. The atmosphere in Grounded is awesome and charming, and it reminds me a lot of the ""Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"" playground that used to be at Disney World's MGM/Hollywood Studios.

Building is my favorite aspect in these survival games, and I feel like the developers took the mechanics found in vanilla ARK, learned from the mistakes, and polished them up. There's not a lot of customization just yet, but there's lots of potential with what's there when they have things like basketball hoops and bounce webs.

Combat is smooth and has more variety than I expected. Different armor sets have different buffs which is a nice touch. For example, the ant set lets you carry an extra plank or log per piece you're wearing. Spiders are outright terrifying, but you can toggle the games arachnophobia mode if you feel like it's something you can't handle. We thought we were safe in the lab by the oak tree until a Wolf Spider kind of glitched through the wall and chased us down the ramp. They can go pretty much anywhere which is odd, but hysterical.

I'd say there's probably about 10-15 hours of learning, building, and exploring you can do here depending on how diligent you are. Obsidian is responsible for making one of my favorite games (South Park: The Stick of Truth) and the wildly popular The Outer Worlds (which I have yet to play), and their good track record makes me optimistic. If you want to watch this game grow and you're a fan of the developers, this is a game worth keeping your eye on. I'd still recommend getting it on sale or waiting until there's more content if you're going to pay full price.",1598372426,1600842514,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True,76561198077250884,140,15,482,0,482,1598556764

67,76408175,english,"Let me start this by saying, I loved this game. I'm going to sum up this with a couple sentences. The combat is really nice and is still lacking a bit. The world is semi lack luster as of now and that's to be expected with early access. The missions as of now are  great and keep you wanting to come back and check the logs to see if anything new was added. 

Now that that's out of the way here's to all of you who want to know a bit more in depth on my opinion. -SPOILERS AHEAD-

Combat - The combat in this game while being rather amazing is a tad lack luster. I'm seriously enjoying how powerful I am with just lady bug gear and a mint mallet but that also leaves me wondering how things are going to get balanced out and how difficult its going to be for new players when the game gets balance checked. As some may know currently the mint mallet is the strongest weapon in the game CURRENTLY I say currently because it is only tier 3 and ive seen weapons in the files and on youtube from data mining that suggest there will be weapons tier 5 and beyond. Mind you im killing wolf spiders in close combat without worrying about dying with a hammer and a few smoothies and obviously some armour. How is the game going to fare when we have these newer tier V and beyond weapons compared to old ones. Am i going to be one shotting all of these enemies I once found terrifying and impossible to beat?? The other thing im concerned of is if they do either reduce the damage of weapons or increase the health and damage of the bigger badder bugs is it going to be a pain to adapt as im now struggling where my base is situated just to leave my base. I understand in the change logs they've stated they're all subject to change and i'm excited for it and im sure we will get further confirmation when the game is updated further on future changes of the insects. 

Survival - The survival aspect is very well rounded and i'm loving it thus far. There is really nothing to touch on other than the juice being overpowered and eliminating the need for some other food source but im not too worried about that.

The Map - The map is very strong and highly impressive though it feels empty at times and can be a bit buggy (no pun intended) it feels very well rounded for being early access.  I do hope to see some more areas in the map and maybe an expansion outside of the backyard is possible in the future. Maybe some sort of traveling system between back yards via saddled insects????? The map does seem lacking in resources and thats understandable considering the state of the game currently. I also hope there are more landmarks as after you've collected a decent stockpile of underground resources theres very little reason to travel underground. Im sure that will change in the near future though. 

Creatures - The game in this state has a decent amount of creatures to find and each with their own unique properties. As stated in the dev vlogs there will be a plethora more in the future and as of now im satisfied with what i have to work with. The spiders are always fun to scream my head off about and the aphids are always a joy to hear when im scared. The aphids are absolutely adorable and i love them. The crow which was recently added has also been a joy to work with and also terrifying wondering if ill be eaten on sight. Its nice to see more creatures other than insects around the back yard.


Overall this game is easily a 7/10 for me but i guarantee when more creatures and landmarks are added that will shoot up drastically.",1600827369,1600827369,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True,76561198312462766,68,3,862,0,862,1598720497

The music mixed with the spiders gave me anxiety (arachnophobe) so I just turned it down and listened to the amazing nature ambiance, It seriously felt like youre in a backyard. It was beautiful. Shooting a spider with my lil bow made me scream and fall off my chair...more than once, and lose my voice for 2 days, as I didnt think they would make that noise or move that fast at me....

43,76253276,english,"Note that this is an ALPHA stage build. They are still adding new features and content at a great pace. There are bugs, and yes there isn't much story YET. With that said, this is pretty fantastic. The ambiance, the writing, the voice acting, and the game play all come together and create an amazing experience. 

The graphics are amazing, everything is so pretty and pops off the screen. Often times, I feel like I'm running around a pixar movie. A Bug's Life is strong in my mind when I climb my way up blades of grass, and finally crest the top of a juice box to survey the yard. It really is a gorgeous sight.

The crafting and survival loop are engaging, but not overbearing. building bases are now a joy, and really easy to do. Food is plentiful, and newer players seem to have a hard time finding good water, which is the dew that forms on the blades of grass. #lookup Just hit the grass with a tool or fists, and the water falls to the ground. You can find mushrooms, and kill bugs to eat their meat. There are several types of armor and weapons to make, most of the recipes are locked behind very difficult bugs. This isn't a bad thing, with a team of 2, it made killing a lady bug easy, I'm sure with 3 or 4, you can make short work of the strongest bugs in the game. 

Moving on to the real threats, the bugs can vary from cute to terrifying. All of them are able to be taken down, but do so at your own risk. Some will actively run from you, most will ignore you unless you attack, and some will hunt you. I'm still unable to take down a lady bug reliably solo, so I've a while to go before end game content. If you have arachnophobia, don't play this game. Spiders are the size of cars or trucks. They are mean and vicious, but if you can time your blocks and dodges, they aren't that bad.

Co-op is good when you're in the game, but the way saves and servers are set up, p2p, it can be frustrating if you or your friends don't have good internet. Or if you wanted to work on the base, but it's your friend's save, so you can't. I think this will need to be addressed soon. (If they need to be paid for monthly, that is understandable, but pricing needs to be reasonable. *conjecture!)

I suggest to buy craftopia instead which they UPDATE DAILY compare to this game which is once a month and the updates are not mindblowing...

I will come back to this game to maybe change the review a year later assuming they even make mind blowing changes...

Pros: Pretty Good graphics similar to raft, different type of monsters compare to other games, Gameplay is similar to The forest which is a zombie survival (prefer if you buy that instead of this)

Unlike many other games in the survival genre the amount of optimization & content is surprisingly more involved and interesting than games such as ARK: Survival Evolved (which has been out of early access for some time with massive bugs) & Conan Exiles with horrible net coding. Of course Grounded comes with a share of bugs in it's state of early access yet if you visit their site directly there is an issue tracker that allows the community to be actively involved in the communication of what is known and to be fixed.

With an in-game feedback system much alike Subnautica's— which inevitably was a large part of that game's success whether we like to admit it or not, that actually allows players to give their feedback alongside their coordinates for specific locations that might tie into their feedback given.

Pros
- Extremely good concept
- Beautiful graphics
- One of the most realistic games I've ever seen (given the story behind it)
- Extremely fun for the first few hours playing the game
- Background and map layout is just fantastic

Cons
- Depth of field is headache inducing 
- Gravity and physics are... interesting...
      - For example, if you set a stack of dandelion leaf things down and walk over it, 90% of the time, the entire stack will fly all over the place
- CURRENTLY not enough to do in the game from what I've played. I felt like I got stuck right after the quests stopped, and got into a place where I didn't know what to do or how to progress
- I got killed by ants a LOT for absolutely no reason. I would come back home, a horde of ants would be at my base, and then a soldier ant would appear for NO reason and kill me. This process repeated about 6 times in my singleplayer world that I spent 2 hours in.
- Some bugs were... Too difficult?

95,75981154,english,"I want to like this game for what it can be, but I must remain fair and review it for what it IS currently. 

This game like many other in its genre does a good job balancing survival, exploration, base building and a hierarchy to armor/weapons and enemies. What small amount of ""questing"" and storyline  that is present is fun and well thought out, to the point where it borderlines an rpg at times. That being said there just isn't enough of this element which is a shame but understandable as it is in early development. 

I have been playing roughly 2 and a half days off and on and already have defeated seemingly every enemy in the game and made best in slot armor sets and weapons for most everything other than a few items that involves more grinding of the same enemy. This is playing on medium difficulty so I'm sure this can take more time as the toughest enemies took over 60 arrows to kill. I had also been able to explore about 75% of the overall map from what I can tell landmark wise. Once again, early development but if you're going to put 30 dollars into something just know what you're getting. 

Overall the graphics and performance were really great and pretty well polished for an early release. I played with my wife the entire time and she (non-host player) more so than me encountered issues with object permanence in game; built items moving around or unusable for her, ect. Restarting the server or having her join / rejoin fixed about 90% of the issues but hopefully this will be remedied as this game develops. I'd say for a prelease and for its concept and potential alone this is a solid 8/10 addictive distraction from the world right now!

Not only is the gameplay loop fun but the game world is enthralling despite being a very familiar concept that's never really been explored too deeply.

As of the last 2 updates, we can now open save files and they load properly. (You know..something that should already happen in any game) But we can't do anything actually new story line-wise. Some map aspects have changed. That's about it. 
Let us burn webs with torches. Add a chem light that we can drop down dark areas or we could throw and enemies would be attracted to them. Or a chem light arrow that lights or way. 
I changed to a thumbs up only because IF it' ever finished, it'll be amazing, Right now..it's a demo. 
Older reviews
17Aug updates: Over time, the loads for new saves has gotten longer and looonger and loooooonger. a 5min waiting for the save file to load, I have given up. Obsidian claims long loads are due to antivirus of firewalls stopping it. I disabled both and it still loads FOREVEEEERRRRRR. It seems like the more I build...the longer it takes to render the save file. As of today..it won't load..it just hangs. But the last time it worked..It stopped crashing. So there's that.  
3 Aug Updated: Consistent crashes every time I try to walk more than 3 min at a time have stopped me from playing all together. It appears it will constantly crash every time you try to pass through specific areas. I've found 3 specific spots on my map where I can't go near or it crashes EVERY time. A few times, the game loads some weird save file that doesn't even exist in my saves. I saved near the water/tree and when I load that save file, it plops me down in the middle of the dry grass area with zero health and I die within seconds.  
The help screens on the Obsidian page are useless unless you create an account. That means you can't even read the FAQ's they default you to when you try to submit a bug. Losing faith quickly.  
The inventory system forces you to still count armor items in your pack even after you wear them (mistake). So helmets, chest and leg/feet armor ALL count against your inventory. As of the late July updates, the chest armors no longer sync with your clothes properly. I see my regular shirt with sort of shoulder pads sticking out. 
A much smaller complaint is, if you drink dirty pond water, it makes your hunger go down? Not very realistic and maybe it should make your vision blurry or maybe affect your walking for a while (staggering) but not make your hunger go down. Old soda or juice is OK to drink? They are considered clean for some reason but should be energy boosters (in my opinion).  Water drops are your best source of clean water. 
One of the quests are to analyze a ant egg. They NEVER SPAWN inside the nest.Someone said, if you killed the worker ants around the ant hill, the eggs won't spawn inside the cave/nest? That's according to one guy online. So you have to go kill other ants outside the cave (further away) so they respawn back at the cave? THEN the eggs appear? This hasn't worked for me since the game crashes every time I try to walk ANYWHERE near the cave these days. Edit: I finally got inside. I read that you have to kill all the soldier ants. I did it. Went back later..no eggs. I killed every ant in the area (worker and soldier)...went back days later, no eggs. I killed NO ants. Ran past them. No eggs. Dropped the quest. 
Pro tip: Apparently the devs don't care about physics. You can build off of a thistle leaf that's like head level or off of a rock and your house will be JUST off the ground..the bugs won't attack it unless you built RIGHT on top of their spawn point. People complained about their homes being wrecked and they built around the bug's homes...I'm shocked...well not that shocked. Build in better locations numb nuts.

Unique game with absolutely stunning graphics.
Fun world map to explore
Scary roaming map bosses
Simple and easy to understand crafting
Co-op with friends

Cons -
AS IT STANDS, game is not worth 30$ BUT I have high hopes for this game in the future when its finished
Story only last maybe 30mins as of review. Its a work in progress.
Can be buggy at times. Nothing game breaking.
Without playing with friends and no story the game can get a little boring after a few hours of exploring.

CONCLUSION: This game is a investment. If you wish to support them buy it now, I have high hopes for this games future.
although right now it does lack a lot of content, It is still a unique and beautiful survival game. Lots of stuff to craft including base building.

38,73429220,english,"*Update: Patches to the game seem to have either optimized a bit or fixed bugs causing lag, the game runs smoothly now!

TL;DR : This game is very short, almost no story has been implemented as of release (about 30 minutes.) This is understandable as it is an Early Access title. If you want to buy this game for the story, I would say to hold off until further updates. This game as it stands right now is not optimized so if you have a low tier - mid range PC, be mindful that you might have frame rate issues. Also be mindful that as of right now, if you want to engage in COOP play, you have to go through your Xbox Online Services and add your friends on your Xbox Account.

**Edit, Edit: I'm disabling comments, they are not constructive in the slightest, I am also changing from Not Recommended to Recommended because while the game itself is fine, the issues I'm experiencing are ultimately what causes me to not recommend it. Adding a TL:DR.

*Edit: I am in fact aware that this game is in Early Access and that it is subject to future updates and fixes, the goal with this review was to point out some problems I had with the game, the game itself is fine, however, due to the technical difficulties I have with this game [b]currently[/b], I cannot personally recommend this game. I am more than happy to change this review to a positive one if the frame rate issues get resolved. I've seen people with RTX 2080 cards getting terrible performance so I believe there's some kind of an issue there. As for the Xbox log-in, sure, it's a mild annoyance, but an annoyance that is not disclosed on the steam store. (Usually, titles that require 3rd party logins have a little warning on the store page.) I am not critiquing the content of the game, this was not the goal of the review, my hope was to inform buyers of potential problems I had with the game.

[b]This game has a lot of potential.[/b]
However, in this current form, I cannot recommend it.
I know this game is in Early Access so I am hopeful the devs will fix these annoyances.

Firstly, the game is poorly optimised, I play on a GTX 1060, 16GB RAM, AMD FX-8320, SSD and I can barely get over 40 FPS on the lowest graphical setting @1080p.

Secondly, the graphical settings aren't customizable, this means you're stuck with the pre-made settings (Low, High, Epic, etc..). I would love to be able to tweak manually every detail, especially since the game runs so poorly on my end.

Thirdly, to play in COOP, you need to log into an Xbox account, it would be fine if it required you to log into your Xbox account if you wanted to play cross-platform with Xbox but right now, if you want to play with your steam friends, you still have to go through your Xbox account which is not optimal, I would love to see the devs using Steam's online services for Steam-Steam COOP.",1595962829,1599772823,True,8,0,0.491811424493789673,45,True,False,True,76561198039266977,531,49,174,0,170,1599773054

I love survival games. I play all of the good ones on Steam and some of the bad ones as well.
Grounded is different. It has all the common survival game tropes but coming from the perspective of a child that has been shrunk down, like the movie Honey, I Shrunk the Kids, which is very nostalgic for me.
The crafting is fun and it doesn't seem like a chore. You are able to repair your gear rather than have to constantly build new items like other survival games. The items you need to repair your gear is common enough that you won't be feeling like you have to constantly farm the items to keep your gear repaired, which gives you more time to build your home.
The graphics and animations are beautiful. I love just climbing up to high points and looking at the environments. Although the map is small, the vertical aspect of some of the zones make it seem bigger.

Being a novice programmer and a big fan of crafting/survival games I have a few cents to add to what others have already said, that I mostly agree with. The game adds a very fresh feel to the genre.

Things I love.
- One (or more) players can design a base and everyone can build it. This is a wonderful feature for collaborative building.
- More than one player can be in a storage chest or crafting station at a time.

A lot of work has been put into the base details and general playabilty of the game. Overall even in pre-release I find it a smooth experience.
Yes there are a few bugs, But I have seen fully released games with alot more. Nothing so far has been game breaking.

Things I would Like to see more of.
-Voice acting, cutscenes and commentary at the beginning. I agree that a tutorial kind of spoils the learning curve. But a bit more ""how the hell are we gonna do that ?""  from the characters in the beginning as they adapt to their circumstances. With the player finding the answer on their own.
- unknown or random milestones that key bigger bug battles. (when players build x, a big spider that does less damage then normal attacks the camp) that kind of thing. It could be great way to introduce bug parts that would be harder to acquire at a beginners level. as well as custom commentary of the characters without it feeling repetitive every time they have to fight a spider.
- Custom difficulty settings, One of 7D2D's and a few others best features was the ability to micromanage the difficulty to your desired play style and game experience.

Highly Recommend to any Crafting/Survival fans.",1599586783,1599586783,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True,76561198016204346,208,3,1040,173,630,1600962465
25,74318181,english,"I LOVE THIS GAME!

After reading other reviews and A LOT OF people complaining about the content of this game I decided to expand review.


I definitely think this game is a high price as an early access game. I would not pay full price if you aren't enthusiastic about the concept, art or content of the game. 

However the common thread that the storyline is short is because most who have played have yet done enough exploration. There is a lot to discover and unlock in this game and it is up to the player to do so. You can stop at the quests and such but this game requires curiousity for it to be fun and extend play time. One hour in the game and most feel like they have finished the game but in reality there is so much to do an unlock in the game. This game is similar to other games that require creativity and the want to build/explore. It took me about 30 hours to finally feel like I'm a spot where its up to my mood if I want to keep playing or not. I play solo and built a base and a sky bridge. I still have yet to unlock everything and explore everything.",1597446758,1599586304,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True,76561198392524535,20,1,2023,0,2017,1600486037

Yes, it is early access and as such, the available ""story"" can be completed in about 15 minutes if you know what you're doing. However, the backyard is surprisingly huge. There are secrets EVERYWHERE. Some that can be accessed now, some that remain locked for future updates. 

The team working on this is SMALL (about 15 people) but they're trying to do major updates every month. They are hoping for a full release in 2021 but that is obviously subject to change. 

I recommend the game readily as it's great fun. 

But there are negatives. It's still early access so bugs (aside from the insect kind) are plenty and not everything works the way it should/will in the final game. While there are many secrets, the ones that you can access aren't fully fleshed out and end up being quick pit stops. Then there's the price. Yes, it's pricey for an early access game. The devs haven't fully stated the final price but I expect it to be more in the $50-$60 range like other Obsidian titles. However, they did state that those who bought the early access pay that price and will get the full game when it releases without paying anything more. It is stated on this store page. So I would definitely argue that buying now and enjoying the content as it is gradually released is the better option because you will eventually get a full game at a discounted price. 

I love the game and I love the team behind it. I'm a fan of Obsidian titles already. But I truly appreciate how transparent the dev team is. They are being upfront about most topics, but realistic. That in a dev team is rare and I think is worth supporting.

We were told by the community at the time to just try making a new world, might have just been our save getting broken by the update. No big deal. Fine, it's early access. So we did it all again.

It's early access. These things happen.

40,75526798,english,"I've been a fan of the concept of shrinking down and exploring a miniature world ever since I first saw A Bug's Life and Ant Man. Now, many people reference this to ""Honey, I Shrunk The Kids""... Of which I've never seen. However, just speaking of the game itself: It is such a fun concept for a survival game. Many-a-game, I have played that were survival-based and this one stands as a jewel among them all for mere uniqueness alone.

Here's my first couple days in the game:
-------------------------------
""I awake in a small tunnel wondering how I got there, I wander a while and find an aphid. I squash it for meat with a pebblet I found along the way. A few more minutes of random resource getting, and I find a machine that turns out to be an analyzing tent of sorts. it gave me blueprints for structures, tools, and so on from the stuff I collected.
Making a lean-to from lily pad...pads, I go to sleep and wake the next day to find ants roaming through my small camp. I didn't think anything of it first off, and then I saw one with big mandibles. It got red eyes upon seeing me. Then, the whole horde of 7 worker ants ganged up with the soldier ant to swiftly make me kick the thimble.
I cautiously respawned and walked to the edges of my camp and notice they were gone, and got my stuff. I wandered a ways and found the story of the game(which I will only describe as that). After a few tasks and stuff, I activated a thing and it went poof then sparks flied and I had to go to a tree... WHERE THERE WERE SPIDERS GALORE!!
Good God, I thought I was scared of Spiders before, even my girlfriend was just terrified of looking at them. I made my way to the place filled with story and stuff happened that was cool. As I was done with the cool stuff I had to drink and eat, but it was night, so I left the doorway to get back to camp... Only to be met with an Orb Weaver spider that leaped at the entrance to the place. I thought I was fine and relaxed for a second, until it leaped again and clipped through the structure and was now inside. I decided to scream and run whichever way was opposite of the eight-legged scare. I made a lean-to from some leftovers in my inventory, several rooms and closed doors away from the main entrance, and slept the night away.

Next day, I checked on the spider and happily found it clipped in place where it could no longer move. With one swift couple hundred thousand pokes from my pebblet spear, the beast was finally slain and I went back to camp; at which point I saved, put away some forgotten loot and closed the game. The next couple of minutes was followed by deep breathing and a few animal photos to calm down my heart...
-------------------------------

First going into the game, I was amazed by everything. Being shrunken down, surviving against the insectal world of your front lawn, unsure of how you got to that size in the first place, makes for honestly one of the funnest experiences I've had the chance of getting, right alongside Ark, where you can walk among the Dinosaurs.

A 9/10 would be my current rating for this game, just because it's still in early access at the time of my writing this. So, my recommendation? Yes, play it.

62,75311664,english,"[b]This feeling is a pain.[/b]

I want this game to be cheaper, because it's Early Access and it costs as much as a finished and revamped game [strike](State of Decay 2 Juggernaut Edition e.g.).[/strike] And they said in their Discord that when finished, [b]the game will cost EVEN MORE[/b], ""giving a benefit"" to the currents Early Access buyers. 

I know that they included a story mode in a Survival game, something not seen often in this kind of games. I know that doing that costs a lot of money and time because of voice actors dialogue lines, etc. I understand that they kind of have a product that no one else has, something not explored before in survival games. So they kinda took an advantage of that and decided to set that 30 dollar price (or even more in a future).
And I accept it, I think 30 bucks it's a fair price. But more than 30?
 
Think about the small team behind Grounded (12 devs and 1 animator), you know it's gonna cost them a lot to develop the game in just a year and a half. And is well known that players can finish in just a matter of minutes/hours something the developers were putting together in a lot of months/years of their valued time. So if you know that almost every grounded player is struggling to pay $30, or doesn't recommend to pay $30 because they know is not worth to pay that much for only a few hours of entertainment, you have a few options to choose.
Or you lower the price (won't happen) or you focus your developers to work in the most requested features that the game doesn't have yet. Features and immersive time-consuming content to grind for. Like achievements, new crafting combinations with new bugs parts, different ways to get those parts, re-balancing, etc.
 
And I'm okay waiting, but at the same time I'm not. Because it happened when we asked them about local co-op/shared split-screen. They told us in discord that the feature was coming to the game, but in a future. I [url=https://imgur.com/a/QcFgCOv]screenshotted[/url] it and saved it. And yesterday when I decided to search for the message again in the server I found out that the message was deleted/edited. Is like they've accepted they can't do that not even in a future.

When you're under pressure and you know you need to finish your game in a year and a half, you end up realizing that sadly you won't be able to include in your game every single idea that you had since the beginning. And if you're not careful enough and you let out of the picture ideas that are important for your consumers, it's probably gonna be reflected in sells/critics.


Basically, this game is a must have if they correct everything and they add a lot of content, but not recommended right now. Sometimes, the co-op with your friends is a very frustrating thing if you're not the host and you're not used to be lagged. Also I hate the motion blur, it has to be disabled messing with the game files, you can't in game.",1599026390,1599345030,False,3,0,0.511754631996154785,3,True,False,True,76561198117427381,62,4,1547,1,129,1601902381

68,75506336,english,"A potentially good game.   It is visually stunning, has great sound and the larger bugs are terrifying.  The crafting system is good and the way recipes work is quite well designed.  There are a few recipes that are ridiculously costly for what you get but all that most likely will be tweaked throughout the early access process.  There is basically no story content right now and you run out of things to do very quickly.  
 
There are a few aspects I really don't like however:

Insta-healing bugs during a fight.  Nothing is worse than fighting a big bug, putting your last expensive arrow into them and watching them retreat 10 ft, heal back to full strength and come back for more.  Simply put, a Lame mechanic.

Many of the things you craft are totally unnecessary and don't do anything.  I realize this is early access, but most of what you can build has no function at all.  chairs, tables, lights, fences, etc all look good but do nothing in game.  There is currently no reason at all to build a fancy base as once you're off the ground, nothing can touch you.  bugs can't climb and there's no air based enemies currently.  No roof, walls or doors required.  Just stick a floor up high, a few necessary crafting and storage items and you have a base.  Literally nothing else is needed.  Unless you find building giant elaborate homes filled with items that do absolutely nothing to benefit your playthrough, base building right now is pretty pointless.

Some of the current crafting recipes are way too costly for what you get.  Repairing most of the better armor takes more expensive and rare resources than building it in the first place.  Venom arrows are pretty useless because before the poison works, the bug runs away and insta-heals. 
The new crow feather is literally as big as you are in the game but only yields one feather piece which  I believe currently gives you 2 arrows.  Not really worth it.

Weapon throwing is pretty broke too.  It's a very cool concept but when trying to do it from an elevated position, say standing on a rock and throwing down at an enemy, you either hit yourself, doing damage to yourself, or your throw goes wildly in another direction and not hitting your enemy at all.  So in summary, the best situation to want to throw your weapon does not currently work at all.

Enough beating up on this.  It is early access after all and a work in progress.  It does appear to have the makings of a quality gaming experience.
I do however think this could be a great game with some tweaking that will no doubt take place as it gets better and better.  There is a lot of potential here but the game still needs a lot of love.

Battle is always a 50-50 chance of winning, even against ants (depending on where you battle them). 

My only dislike, if you can call it that, is the lack of being able to tell your direction, like North, West, South, East. I would love a compass but I won't complain if there isn't one in the future. I can still get around pretty well. I would also love to have multiple save files as my brother plays this as well. I'm hope that will come in the future. My only other dislike is the need for Xbox Live for multiplayer.

I mean, hell, who haven't thought about being shrunk before? Just like in those wacky movies.

It's just so damn beautiful/cute/terrifying at the same time. You'll be facing cute and weak gnats, weevils and ant workers; Cute but strong ladybugs; Nasty and quick spiders; Well, so on and so forth.

Just like those other survival games, you'll be on the lookout for resources to build your base and improve your equipment: from grass-made walls and floors, to weed stem palisades and gates, spiked clubs and bows, insect armors...

While right now the game doesn't have any story yet, i would say that the story is the least important part of the game, at heart this is a survival game and there's already so much meat to spend at least 50+ hours, with more content coming out every once in a while with new enemy types and tools to use.",1597611926,1599312400,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True,76561198051547379,309,34,1215,0,558,1598466383

Snap-in building is god awful and a headache to build bases. The system is just as bad as Fallout 4's.

Wait for a sale. Whenever the basic base building isn't complete dog shit, I'll recommend. Of all things in a survival game to get lazy on, base building definitely shouldn't be it.

Edit: After putting a few more hours in, I don't understand why this game has a decent amount of positive reviews. After a couple of hours the flaws become more apparent and annoying to deal with. It does look pretty, but that's hardly a reason to recommend this game. With other survival games like Rust and Ark showing a solid system for base-building, you'd think Obsidian would understand how to implement a proper system. The FO4-esque feel to their system makes it extremely frustrating to build bigger bases later on in the game.

TL;DR this game is pretty much a demo rn and the building system feels like FO4",1599247695,1599299636,False,1,1,0.439847201108932495,0,True,False,True,76561198032043351,229,30,210,0,128,1599258818

Once you have a start to build a big enough base your frame rate will drop so badly you start to feel like its lagging, on a single player game. Also some items like ant eggs will spawn and are unable to be picked up. The Trampoline if you jump on it wrong it will start spaz out and start making a infinite loop of trampoline noise that sounds like a car engine, you cant turn it off until you restart the whole game. Armor sets while some are useful are very dull looking. It just seems to me they wanted to make money fast and brought it out for early access so that they have time fix all this BS later. But the content as it stands its nothing, barely any story all you have is you going around killing bugs and making armor and tools.  OH and the terrible base building with in some spots of the map, if you build over them, you have grass and wood just growing right through your base blocking your way through your own base and the only way to move around it is to cut down every single time.

Compared to games like, MINECRAFT, SUBNAUTICA, FORREST, STRANDED DEEP, RUST, ARK and etc. this game is not worth thirty and its so bad in base building, and have way too little content and way too many bugs.

I bought this game $ 40 (CA) thinking of buying a simple early access game that looked promising-ish. And damn it... I got my money's worth hehe.. If the game was at it's current state for the same price ... I would probably buy it anyway, it's honestly amazing. Quick runthrough : Survival game, sometimes really cute, other times, literaly a F*cking nightmare, plenty of creatures & insects, and they're pretty much all really cool and interesting by the way (APHIDS), a lot of different environments and ressources, interesting base building (a bit like Rust tbh) etc. 
Me : *sees Aphid* 
Also me : Awnnnnnn
Aphid : Good f*cking bye 
Although the game is sometimes buggy / has lacking features (not that there is a lot, just remember it's early access atm**WHICH ALSO MEANS there is a lot of incoming features and content), it's just worth it. This game has a charm and vibe that only few games can brag about. I was not disappointed, far from it, and I hope you neither. 

I highly recommend this game, especially if you enjoyed Rust for it's progressive advancements. If you're like skeptical about the game, just buy it, WORST case, you'll refund it. 

Be careful as you rule the backyard, there are vicious and terrifying spiders out there...
I hope you have a wonderful playthrough in this survival-cute-horror/action-adventure/sandbox/online-coop game :)

93,75235830,english,"[h1] The Undeniable Truth [/h1]
The truth behind this game is that it is fun.  It is very fun.  It has a similar vibe to The Forest but it's also different enough that I can still get different experiences.  Below I will go more in more depth.
[b] Story/Goals [/b]
If you are looking for a game that tells you what you need to do next, this game is not for you.  Right now the campaign is relatively short (as in 30 minutes to an hour).  As the game continues to update, more and more will be added, but in terms of the game telling you what to do it is very limited (as of right now).  If you are a person who can establish your own goals, you will be able to play this game just fine.
[b] Difficulty [/b]
The game can be on the harder side, but nothing like Dark Souls.  It tells you some things, but for the most part you might find yourself looking up info on the internet or experimenting through trial and error.  When you start out the only thing you can take on are mites and gnats.  But as the game goes on you will be able to take on harder bugs, but that requires better equipment.  This game does reward exploration as there are resources only available in certain parts of the map.
[b] Map [/b]
The map is not randomized, meaning that you will start to memorize it as you play.  This is both a good and bad thing.  It's good because you will eventually get to the point where you will no longer be lost and will know where you are.  It's bad because you will most likely find a spot you like and will always build a base there and will learn the cheap spots of the map.
[b] Resources [/b]
From what I can tell, some resources respawn while others do not.  Basic resources such as grass and dandelions will respawn with time.  Granted you need to destroy the stub (otherwise it won't grow back).  But other resources such as mints (used for a weapon) do not.  Instead they give you a lot and you need to use it wisely.  I cannot tell if quartzite respawns (the material used for repairing).  However, even if it doesn't you get a lot of it so I wouldn't worry about it for now.  One thing to note is that this game does have a hunger system.  I have personally gotten by without building dew catchers and all of that as water droplets do respawn every morning after you sleep, but it is something to keep in mind as you play.  It isn't one of those things where water is stressful.  On normal you only have to refill your water 1 1/2 to 2 times a day which isn't that bad.
[b] Enemies [/b]
The enemies in this game are diverse in appearance, however how their attacks are somewhat the same.  Most enemies will do some form of a lunch forward to attack.  Makes sense because how else are bugs going to attack you?  STAY THE F*** AWAY FROM LADY BUGS!  THEY HIT AS HARD AS A WOLF SPIDER AND ARE EVEN MORE TANKY WHY ARE THEY SO DANGEROUS?!  Also I am not afraid of spiders, but turning around to see a giant spider just staring into your soul is one of the most horrifying things I've ever experience, and this is coming from someone who has genuinely pissed off their fiance.
[b] Skill Tree [/b]
Believe it or not this game does have a (glorified) skill tree.  It is not a traditional one, as there is no leveling up in the game.  Instead, you unlock perks (called mutations) by doing something over and over again.  Each mutation can be leveled up a total of three times.  But, you can only have three mutations active at once.  Some mutations include Natural Explorer (which increases running speed), Ant-nihilator (more dammage to ants), Grass Master (cut down grass faster) and so on.
[b] Verdict [/b]
As the game stands I would give it a 85/100.  It definitely has a lot of potential and is a lot more fun with friends.  That's not to say you can't have fun by yourself, it's just more fun with friends.  There are some things that needs work.  For starters, all saves are located in the same menu.  Meaning if you have a single player and multiplayer world, you will have to remember where they are as there are no slave slots.  A little annoying.  Another thing is that worker ants are a little bugged (hehe) right now.  They can rummage through baskets and take things.  But their reach is really long and can go through walls.  So you have two solutions: build a wall around your house to keep them out or use chests since they can't get in those.  I use both just to be sure.  There aren't really any noticeable bugs that I have ran into so far besides that ant one.  I've gotten stuck once but was able to get free by spamming jump and the game has only crashed once but then they updated it and patched it.  If you have the money, or your friends have the game then I would definitely check it out, but I wouldn't say it is a ""must have"" as of right now.
[h1] EDIT [/h1]
After playing the game for a while longer I've decided to update the verdict.  I would now give this game a 90/100.  I've noticed that there are varieties among the attacks though they are hard to notice.  Lady bugs, for example, have two types of attacks.  One is a basic headbutt while the other is a charge.  Stinkbugs have two as well: an AOE gas attack and a headbutt.  Bombardier Beetle can spit acid and, you guessed it, headbutt.  The game had more to offer than I thought and quartzite does indeed respawn.",1598900831,1599170203,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True,76561198036814393,223,15,2589,184,1128,1601929492

I absolutely adore this game but man I think it may give me a heart attack! It's a really fun mini survival game with so much to explore and a really good tiering of bugs to fight. From aphids, that just try to run, to giant wolf spider, who will kick your butt in .2 seconds if you don't prepare yourself. And really well thought out enemies in between to make it hard but not too hard to advance your skills to eventually kill the wolf spiders (not with ease for me yet, but it's doable!) 

I was not afraid of bugs and spiders before this game but now whenever I see a freaking ladybug now I get a jolt of adrenaline which is a weird and fun thing to experience from such a mundane bug. Gorgeous! I commend the Devs for such a brilliantly executed game! 

HOPES:

45,75327313,english,"I'm making this review based on what I think of the game potential, rather than the current state. 

Grounded is similar to other survival games, such as Raft, Green Hell with it's own twist. It feels like a different game nevertheless. 

The food and water aspect of the game feels balanced. You have to make sure you have enough of them but it won't be time consuming. That allows you to focus on the fun part of the game.

The base building was a nice surprise for me. Not only do you have a lot of main parts for base building, such as stairs, walls, windows but also decorative parts. You can build stuffed ants, different kinds of lamps. Those are small things but can make your base look very nice.

The map is very large, along with the variety of different creatures. It will take a while until you beat the early access version of the game, which is a good thing. Grounded has rich content.

Currently, I was playing with my friend, who was the host. In the span of two days, my character reset twice. Meaning after logging in, I started a brand new character. Lost all the items I had right before and all the perks and there was no way to get back the progress.

We built our base on top of water, which was buggy for me. From time to time, all the items from the base were ""teleported"" near the entrance, while those items were still existing in the base. I could interact with the invisible items, where they actually were but they appeared elsewhere (hope this makes sense).

All in all, my experience was good and bad but it's an early access game. I can't wait until the character progress bug will be fixed so that I could play again.",1599055767,1599055767,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True,76561198026992884,72,1,853,1,830,1601757825

It is beautiful to look at, beautiful to play and great great fun.  The crafting is bang on, the way to unlock recipes is, in my humble opinion, very unique and it isn't just thrown at you so you can make everything straight away.  
It also forces you to kill some of the bigger insects to progress along the crafting menus and if you play solo, like me, then it sets a big challenge for each of the high end things.  
The overall play of the game is just great.  It constantly has you needing to do something else to get further on in the game and the way they have spread the map out makes you have to trek to places far away, passing dangers you wouldn't want to go to unless you had no choice.

53,75314699,english,"My family enjoys grounded quite a bit. I play with both my 7 year old boy and 12 year old girl.  They also play together.  You can tell the makers really studied the survival horror genre and tried to instill the good parts in a package that wasn't too intense for children (of course that doesn't keep my 7 year old from freaking out about the spiders)  There is no doubt in my mind that they've played games such as The Forest and the like.  My son bugs me to play this and minecraft every day with him.  In his world, there is no higher accolade.  I enjoy the game as well.  Right now it's pretty much a framework.  There is no revealed plot other than what you can surmise by the setting: That you are children that have been shrunken by scientists that have set up shop in the miniaturized expanded vastness of a back yard and all that entails.  Honey I shrunk the kids meets Hatchet and Call it Courage.  I feel as though this game might actually increase my 7 year old's courage as he is forced to face his fears.  There is no final story to beat yet.  I can only imagine that this is forthcoming.  I must admit, like others indicated when Burgl (sp?) told us we had finished what they had so far in the game I was a little  disappointed after paying for two licenses for the game.  The game has so much visual polish that it was quite a surprise they had released it on steam xbox, etc without much more to the plot to the game present in gameplay (don't get me wrong what they have done is quite an accomplishment)... It seems like they screwed the pooch somewhat.  I do anticipate this being remedied in the near future but with consumers that does tend to burn bridges.

I really like the look and gameplay of this game.  I honestly get sick of the look of minecraft and it's blocky gimmick and don't even get me started on the ugliness of Roblox visuals so it's great that my kids now have
something so visually appealing that I can join them in.  We also like the characters and their different personalities, although we kinda wish there were a few more kids/options.  For example, for my son his choice was either the cool kid or the nerd...for him that meant there wasn't really a choice at all.  As an adult I enjoy this game.  Even though the main characters are children I could totally play this on my own and enjoy it.

Now on to the bad:

One thing that they need to fix RIGHT AWAY is their save and connection system.  One of us gets booted off our multiplayer pretty often.  and oftentimes when that happens you can't rejoin the game no matter what you do Unless the person hosting saves and quits and starts the multiplayer all over.  This needs to be worked out because many might not figure out the workaround and it's annoying and tedious even if you do figure that out and infuriating if  you can't.

Another thing that needs to be addressed is that the save system needs to be improved.  I have 2 accounts and I had saves on one, but as soon as I joined a multplayer on another account it wiped out my original saves, all of them.  I tried hosting again on the original account and they were nowhere to be seen.  This is a serious problem in a mutliplayer game and it just makes people not even want to use that aspect if it risks their data.  If you can't play on another server without losing your own saves the programmers haven't thought things out.  Nothing is more frustrating than having hours of work just magically whisked away.  


Overall I believe the game will eventually be worth what I paid for it.  Right now it is a little frustrating and I hope the devs work out these issues.  Since a lot of kids move at a slower pace it might not even care that the game isn't in final form.  Certainly there are lots of kids and adults that play games like minecraft and the forest not even to reach the ending.  The basebuilding and crafting alone in Grounded is enough for one hell of an experience.  I feel that the saving and server issues are the priorities that need to be addressed immediately by the devs.

Right now I give the game a 6/10.  When these issues are addressed I'll revise this.",1599033469,1599033469,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True,76561199017135132,51,1,961,30,772,1601122314

73,75302329,english,"I will not lie- I've screamed out loud more than once and I don't care. 

TONS of fun, especially with a friend or two! There's lots to do and explore, tons of mystery they've yet to apply in game (you can tell there's more coming when you begin to really explore- locked doors, creepy ant-totem cave, places labelled ""under construction"" etc... can't wait to see what comes next!) The characters are amusing and polished, and when together in the game with others, they respond to each other's statements at times.

 The game itself runs fairly smoothly, with a few hitches, but knowing it's still in development, my friends and I are dealing with the few annoying issues as they've appeared- relog when the leantos and chests disappear, host restarts game if players are booted repeatedly, and using a different voice chat system because it doesn't seem to work quite the way it should yet. (only host, or only guest/s get to use it until it randomly begins to work, IF that happens) Also, you can't see your own chat typed out at first, but it does seem to randomly start working in the color of the toon you chose after a while... not sure how long, but just randomly starts showing up.

 So yes, if you can't stand any ""bugs"" in your game, this one is probably not for you- YET, (but then if I were you, I'd stop shopping the Early Access pages, as that's what you'll likely find.) You should however, consider adding it to follow or on your wishlist, because it'll be one helluva game when it's in the final stage! :)
 On the other hand, if you like to help developers stay paid and creating, and play games before they're *quite* finished, YES, this a GREAT game.  I am looking forward to the future of Grounded, as I can TELL there's a lot more of some exciting content en route.

93,75217284,english,"I was hesitant to buy Grounded so early on in its development stage, but something about it and watching other gamers play it made me want it even more – I’d describe it as nostalgia even though there haven’t been any games like it!

One of the best things about Grounded, while on Early Access, is the availability and openness of the developers. As part of the community you feel listened to, your ideas matter and when you report a bug (I know, this pun got overplayed fast) it gets proper attention from the team.

However, and this is something you must understand before buying it, this IS an Early Access Game. Bugs (not the fun kind), crashes, lost saved games, bases being destroyed by updates that change the in-game world, multi-player connection issues, and much more is common occurrence and to be expected. It’s what you sign-up on when purchasing a title in Early Access.

That said, the developers do listen to the community and if an issue or suggestion gets enough track, they’ll do their best to fix it/implement it. They’ve also given us a roadmap of future updates - https://grounded.obsidian.net/feature-board - in case you want to wait for more content and patches before you buy it. Because right now, as far as story goes (which is the most compelling thing about Grounded), you can breeze through it in under 45 minutes. The rest comes down to building and gathering resources or exploring.

If common Early Access issues and all that entails make you rage quit or get frustrated with a game, I’d advise waiting for next year when I expect this game to be fully completed. But if you want to jump in this amazing game and contribute your ideas and suggestions, then go ahead!

So far, great game, lots of promise. Hopefully it will deliver on that!",1598875750,1598979362,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True,76561198047455786,20,1,6811,0,6747,1600861117

Glitches: 10/10 - Higher number worse
This is the most glitchy piece of junk I have played in awhile. How the heck is that hard to put a wall up, just have them connect. Goodness gracious what pain in the A! Water not responding when I first started playing, now it is but other things are still god awful horrible. This more pre-alpha with these kind of game breaking mechanics. Way too much money for an early access with this type of conflicts. I find it funny how developers charge people half the games price to play game breaking glitches that we help find that they prosper from. Should be the other way around? Maybe it's just me, but 30 bucks for hardly any story and these glitches. Not cool developers not cool. 
Graphics: 8/10 - Higher number better
Better than the average game, nothing wrong with average. But it has a wonderful pallet of color. Truly brilliant and breathtaking on different spots and locations. The ability to go way up and look over the entire yard like its the grand canyon. Goodness I love it. Give me more.
Content: 1/10 - Lower number worse
How can a world be this big and this empty? Where is the dialogue, where is the notes. The small side stories, anything other than a few lines of dialogue? Really? A kid could have come up with more depth in an hour. I know it looks like I'm complaining alot, but honestly the story is really. Well. Not much. I am used to deep story, so maybe this is more of the norm? I don't care for no depth, I like breaking bad complexity and mechanics. It's science! But without any explanation of hardly anything and empty like my wallet in this pandemic.
Replayability: 2/10 - Lower number worse
I can't believe I got bored after about 10 hours of not knowing where stuff is. 10 hours figured out where the majority of stuff is. I mean. Alright, now what. That's about it. The quest is to scan a grub. You mean to tell me the quest is to dig up a grub, then have to walk all the way back and scan the grub. Boom. That's the quest? Again no complexity, no depth, a kid in an hour could have came up with something more.
Sound - 9/10 - Higher number better
Good god the sound is amazing! So scary at times. Those grubs made me jump to high hell. I called them a ton of curse words and still they get me. I just hate them, but the sound is so good. The spiders chasing you down through the grass. Oh my heart attack is a knocking. This thing raised my blood pressure by 20 points, thank you. I mean it, the sound really immerses you this wonderful empty no dialogue world. It has very nice calming effect of sound at some points and then quickly turns to scary blood curdling jump fest that sends you back to momma crying.

Voice Acting 5/10 - Higher number better

Could it have killed you to given him a few more lines of dialogue. I mean if I have to hear Brussels sprouts one more time I'm gonna stuff them down Peter's throat till chokes and dies on them. Shut the hell up about Brussels sprouts or I will drowned you in the pond you little picky eating white boy.

Mechanics 1/10 - Lower number worse

This is the most clumsy wack a mole of mess I ever saw. Chests next to the workbench, you have to go through you 8 chests to find the dang piece of junk your trying to use. Why the heck wont the game just take from my inventory, and to find out what is not researched I have to go to the workbench to find out which items need to be researched and then remember from my 8 chests of stuff what to research and then walk half way across the map with those items to scan them but can only scan three items and then have to do the whole thing over again until it recharges. What the actual F? Why are walls so hard to place, why am I constantly getting stuck on grass, why does it take 50 arrows to kill a spider for 1 venom that gets you 5 arrows but then they disappear but the regular arrows don't. I get it, early access. So here developers, here is 10 bucks. This what you gave me. Now give me my 20 bucks back lol.

Conclusion 5/10


In conclusion. While the first hours are amazing and so good. It's like Mcdonalds food, it's really good but then later you feel sick and ate something that wasn't real food. This isn't a real game, it's like a piece of piece of piece of game. And you know it's missing so much. But to charge that much for this, is like a scam. But at least they gave you something, that something is 20 less bucks out of my pocket. For 10 bucks I would agree for this game missing so much. But 30? The developer must have been dehydrated from running back forth from the research tent to think of charging that amount of money. Here have some water droplets as they just recently started respawning lol.",1598836599,1598836599,False,2,0,0.499154359102249146,2,True,False,True,76561198872739615,11,3,2612,0,1593,1599439463

I downloaded the game based on vague memories of early trailers and gameplay clips, one friend's recommendation for a game in the survival genre, and 90% based on one word: Obsidian. Knowing Obsidian stole Bethesda's thunder with New Vegas was all the extra push I needed to hit the buy button, and so far I have not been disappointed at all.

The world is vibrant and beautiful, the perspective of being a tiny person in a big world is done very well, the dangers of the yard feel genuinely threatening even on mild mode (you spend a LOT more time running than fighting from the big stuff until you get good equipment). The building system has had some flaws but I've already seen a lot of them fixed with just one patch, and ultimately the base-building system is everything Fallout4 ever wished it was, so once again thank you Obsidian for putting those AAA-game-ruining sponsor-pandering toolboxes at Bethesda in their place.

The quests that already exist are compelling enough but I'm excited for what's to come -- the intrigue is high but the content just isn't there yet to back it up. That being said, it's still an excellent game.

2. For whatever reason, they decided to make your equipped items stay in your inventory bag instead of just taking space up on the body. 
3. The menus are cumbersome and annoying to navigate.
4. The building has some cool features like ghost builds, so you can see what it'll look like before you build and the snap to grid works well. Unfortunately, they don't have a builder mode or easy way to get to the build menu to easily change what you want to build and that got really annoying.

24,75176817,english,"This game has great potential IMO.

I'm not going to go into graphics and gameplay too much, plenty of reviews for that. I'll only say that the game looks pretty good and plays pretty well on my upper middle tier rig. 

I am mostly writing this for those thinking about getting this game. If you like games like Rust or Ark you will certainly enjoy this twist on the survival/building genre. Currently the game has a very good base to be built on from what I've seen so far. I haven't encountered too much as far as game breaking bugs personally. A few graphical issues but certainly things I would assume will be patched and fixed up at some point. For an Early Access game it has a lot of features already and I would fully expect loads more to be added. 

I would love to see this game go in an Ark like direction. It would be cool to see it become larger and have more variety in the critters you encounter. Although there are currently quite a few. It would be cool if you could somehow tame some things and ride them around and what not. I would also like to see the building functions expand like Ark. For me these kinds of games are great for equal parts survival and building, that's what I like to play. So far it's on a good track and I can't wait to see how they flesh out stuff as the game grows. 

The main thing I would like to mention is that this game is currently essentially single player. You would only be able to play with a friend on your steam list at this time it seems. The server browser only searches your friends games but it does say a global server search is coming eventually. If you have a friend to play with this shouldn't be a problem. A looking for group thing in the xbox live companion or discord may help here, i haven't tried that yet. So far playing alone has been fun. [ NOTE: A random person on my friends list was playing and I joined their game. I can confirm it does work.]

Lastly,.... SPIDERS ARE SCARY AF YO! LOL. I got killed by one but otherwise I just run away like a scared little girl when I see one. I wouldn't even consider fighting one yet but maybe one day I will have the strength to take on this mighty beast! Hopefully there is a day when you can catch and ride one.... You will be the king of the backyard! 

Anyway, in conclusion it's well worth it to buy at this point if you enjoy this genre. There is enough to keep you busy for now and I'm sure more will come soon.

The problems I mentioned? I get SO irritated with the system for placing down items/building material. There is an issue with the pathing where sometimes the ""block"" just won't sit down even when it has the room. And there is a bit of trouble with the elevation of items as well, sometimes you have to place a block at a higher or lower elevation and they act as hard barriers that you have to jump over. Even though you can simply walk over natural terrain features that are more severe, i.e. rocks and sticks. 

Then there's the fact that during updates the world shifts in drastic fashions that can screw up what you have built. Like grass suddenly growing through your support beams, floors, and roof. Or that suddenly the area you built in is suddenly a swamp. Though, once again, this is early access so you have to expect changes to the game like this.

Still, I see plenty of room for this game to grow and become seriously fun over the course of it's development. I can't wait to see what the devs come up with!

The different biomes separate themselves seamlessly, never giving way to the backyard feel. Everything feels natural. Everything except one thing...

The only negative points I have to make is that the arrows are too tedious to pick up and the decision for the server being created on the client... 

Not only is creating arrows one of the biggest grinds, but you must collect them by individually clicking each arrow while hovering your cursor over them... When you take 20-30 arrows per target often times you end up being spawned on as your taking back your arrows. It would be much better if arrows were pickup on collide...

Now when one of the clients become the master(i.e. the client that creates/loads the game) it means that all the other players playing a)only play when the master is on, b)have stability limited by the masters setup, c)does not have a choice to save their progress, and d)become nothing more than harvesters for the master client. Solutions are hard because of the open world and small server sizes. With more players in one lobby, dedicated servers could be justified, sadly the game is directed towards groups of friends that already know each other and all have Microsoft accounts.",1598729231,1598729231,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True,76561198020479219,122,8,3068,0,2513,1598931200

Interesting early access game. Definitely if survival early access is your thing, this is going to be a compelling offer. In it's current form you're getting a compelling and unique world, solid crafting mechanics and great character movement (which is usually rare for early access games). Places that need work: the campaign is only 15 minute long filler, the combat is passable but weak and the bugs are numerous. Expect 6-7 hours of gameplay right now. Obsidian Entertainment is a reputable game developer and look forward to seeing where this game goes given it doesn't die before the development cycle finishes. You just never know with early access games. I made a totalbiscuit style first impression on this game, check it out if you'd like to see more before buying.

Having originally said it cannot be recommended for a few notable bugs, these have now been significantly improved.

The respawns that were broken and resulted in a significant grind are now plentiful and investing time in building structures is mostly working now.  Although this has resulted in a much better experience, there are still some really annoying pinch points ...

  1) Host/Client desync is a serious problem.  Pretty much every time I host a game with friends, we are unable to see each others blueprints and stepping on ""finished"" locations results in disappearing from others visibility, or they end up falling through the world.  Various structures are also ""kinked"" so that platforms appear in different locations on different players sessions.

  2) Random crashes ... no apparent reason, sometimes moving, sometimes building, sometimes combat.

Things are improving so kudos to the developers pushing out fixes over content at the moment and I dare say this will continue to improve in the following months.  This still feels like it was released a month or two too early, assuming you can put up with the bugs (code not in game) then the game is actually a lot of fun.

It has given us all an incredible experience with a simple survival game with an interesting and unique new take. I highly recommend this game to all. The only negative word i have about Grounded is due to connectivity issues. When we first started our base we had a few issues with disconnects even though many of us including our server host have gigabit internet and huge download and upload speeds and more than efficient gpu's and ram. However, after 500+ man-hours and countless grass planks among thousands of other resources our server is almost completely unplayable. Falling through terrain and structures on spawn and disconnects that appear to happen randomly and so frequently that it makes accomplishing any task impossible. Structures will render for some players and not for others and construction blueprints act erratically often appearing in 4 different places for 4 different players. Please support this game so that Obsidian can make the proper changes and upgrades to fix these issues and continue to add new features to Grounded. Thank you to the Obsidian team for this terrific game and i hope to play much more in the future.

In Grounded's current state I would NOT recommend playing this game regardless of the fact that it is ""EARLY ACCESS"" there are still issues with multiplayer which prevent many players playing with friends through hosting and joining which for many is a deal breaker. I don't believe early access as a label gives a studio the right to push out a game with very little content or depth. The whole game experience can be completed in 3  hours which, building is very limited so you don't have much variety, which is a shame.

Graphically, the game is amazing. I love the detail of the environment and insects. It is still early access, so there are some bugs. The biggest thing I have seen was already fixed in the last patch. Currently, the only issue I have is some of the Esc buttons in various menus have to be clicked (hitting Esc doesn't work), but honestly that's not gonna kill my experience. I haven't experienced crashes like some have reported. 

My laptop is an Asus that's probably around 6-7 years old, but it runs the game just fine on several settings so far. I do have a bit of lag at my base when I put lighting everywhere, but it hasn't interfered with combat near the base so far.

All in all, I really want to see how far this game is going to go. I would love more building options because I'm loving the base building a lot. Is this game only confined to this backyard?

Its one where you wander around and never even remotely struggle to find food and water, but then get murdered in one shot by half of the incredibly poorly designed (for combat and balance purposes) enemies that occupy like 70% of the yard you're in. 
Build a base? Nah, the game will just spawn a wolf spider outside your base while you sleep so it destroys everything you placed. Just stay in side and not sleep? Nah, itll spawn Larva INSIDE your base causing a wolf spider to come running over and destroy your base. Just build a camp or something? Nah, one of the spiders will aggro onto you from approximately half a (relative) mile away and kill you on the way to your camp or the instant you awaken. Want to explore? Well half the map is just a spider's nest, water, or a fungal cloud.

However, with friends? This is perfect, it's a addiction like no other - and whilst it may be somewhat ruthless of a world, it never gets old - you never know exactly what is around every corner.. (warning, it's probably a spider. Run.)

They seem to be adding things at a great pace for the size of their company and everything the world is going through right now - and yeah sure, some things are still somewhat clanky (I.e... building flooring ontop of walls can cause some issues such as getting stuck etc etc, nothing a jump can't fix!) it is still is an Early access game.

86,74853683,english,"I have to admit a predisposition and bias toward this one. I generally love Obsidian and consider most of what they release to be rather good. If you agree with that or not may impact if you agree with the review.

I think grounded is great. With my preword there, that probably goes without saying, but I really think the folks at Obsidian have really managed to capture something... Yet again. Perhaps I'm overthinking things, but this appears to be tentative steps toward emergent storytelling first hinted at in Outer Worlds, the company branching into more diverse storytelling methods to enrich the ways their obviously extremely talented team can portray these fantastic worlds that exist within their creative minds, capturing the nostalgic imaginations of the old and the bright-eyed imagination of the youth. I hope to see more of their growth as true artists of the medium. Anyway, all that artsy stuff aside and with the forgoing of any more sucking of Obsidian's girthy meat, the game.

Grounded behaves like one would expect a survival game to work. You gather materials, make workbenches, build bases, make storage (MORE STORAGE), progress through tech and make new things. It shows an impressive amount of content for an early access title and has plenty of unlocks, locations to discover, recipes to learn and gear to craft. The building feels satisfying although slightly lacks customisation options in terms of the pieces themselves, there are sufficient decoration structures and decor to make your own creation. The crafting is crafting and the gear feels varied, and better tools feel like better tools in almost every way.

The combat feels tight and is reliant on two fairly important things, those being stats granted to you by items and occasional buffs like smoothies, as well as the block and perfect block mechanics. Tougher enemies like Wolf Spiders might require mastery of the Perfect Block Technique to go toe-to-toe with them, and others like the Bombadier Beetle will require more subtle tactics, as their acid gloop and shotgun spray will keep you from facetanking encounters with them with perfect block. It all feels interesting to master and forces you into using different tactics and sometimes different gear for certain enemies. A stink bug while wearing a gas mask is a relatively trivial encounter, as another example of the systems at play working together.

The story is largely emergent, and as you continue to play you'll get a better idea of exactly what's going on. There is a light exposition dump from a NPC and it's so on the nose it feels like a self referential joke of itself and some notes and audio logs scattered around that fill in blanks as you play, but the observant player will pick up plenty from the environment. It feels like a saturday morning cartoon in the 90's that has menus and flashing arrows and points and objectives for the kids and then subtle references for the parents in the background... Like a Battletoads figuine sitting in a puddle somewhere in the backyard.

Ultimately, a lot of fun and I'm still yet to experience anything but the single player. I'm positive with a few friends, it could be an experience of fun and adventure quite unlike any other and I'm absolutely looking forward to what comes out of this title as it moves from early access to full release and perhaps beyond.",1598298433,1598298433,True,21,3,0.733562469482421875,1,True,False,True,76561198044280999,147,16,2183,0,2183,1597817991

-1 problem i have faced is the monsters attack are too predictable they need to add options to the enemies like worker ant escapes when low on health 

- they need to change the spider fighting mechanics like why wont spiders fight on their own ground making u come to fall in webs it would be awesome and more challenging 

- if they add more attack animations and make the foe back up and come swiftly for a counter attack the fight will not be predictable as now

thats all i got for now

58,74789278,english,"90 hours... It feels like yesterday I started playing Grounded. I guess it's true, ""Time flies when your being chased by spiders."" This game has been an absolute blast to play with my friends. This was the game I didn't know I needed in my life, until I played the demo. For me it was the nostalgic 90's vibe and the memories of Honey I Shrunk the Kids. Plus the pricing is just right, this could have easily been a standard $60 game and at only half that price you are getting a solid base game with a whole lot of future content and potential. 

Now keep in mind, the game is in early access and is said to be around 20% completed. Even at a 5th of it's completion and at 90 hours in, I'm still finding new things in the backyard, so don't let the talks of the current short campaign scare you away. They are building the story with each content update, but exploring this tiny world and base building is where the real fun is. The game is pretty fair with it's resources too, so it's not to much of a grind to building bases or weapons and armor. There is a nice mix of familiar bugs you can currently interact with and while some are tanks starting out, with a little time, you'll be the king of the backyard. 

As for the game overview, the graphic are beautiful, the music puts you at ease... well until your life is at risk of being somethings next meal. The controls to me felt better on a controller than keyboard, but that's the beauty of having that option. There is a lot of flexibility when it comes to base building, I just wish we could build into the environment to make cleaner builds. The whole time playing I never felt like I was under/over powered throughout my character progression. Everything I still do feels rewarding and the grind is still enjoyable. If anything you've seen or read has peaked your interest a little about this game, it won't disappoint.

This game is still early access, but still pretty fun to play...the biggest thing lacking in that sense is the story is not very far along.
So, in the meantime it does have several options for difficulty in regular play as well as a creative mode if you just want to see what you can build.  I have started over several times just to see what areas worked best for starting up my bases and such (almost anywhere is good if done right though). My first base was by the baseball and built on scaffolding with my leanto on top of the baseball until I was ready but my favorite spot is near the Oak Base on top of the edgers.
I am kind of curious how they are going to span the game out to make it ""last"". If they do it right, it can be an ongoing fun game even if the story is short. I would love to see an expansion that goes into the house and/or shed (or both). I say expansion as I believe that would certainly be worthy of additional funds.

My only gripes with the game so far are: 

1) Inventory Management - Your armor is part of your inventory, as is your hot bar. That shouldn't be. But again, this looks to be something that will change so it probably won't be a gripe for long.

2) Enemy AI - They're a bit too predictable for my liking. But this is a minor gripe. Still, it should not be that you can completely own an Orb Weaver spider the size of a car while taking next to no damage just because you have ""the best club"" in the game. The fights need to be more intense for the larger enemies. Otherwise, where's the challenge and the heart thumping in your chest feeling supposed to come from?

3) Building - Overall it's better than some games I've played like ARK Survival Evolved. But there are still I'm a little irritated by some of the placement issues that plague you when you try to build on a semi-flat surface and encounter clipping issues on the second wall you try to put down just because the tiniest bit of the corner is touching the ground. That tiny bit shouldn't prevent the placement. Ya know?

Overall though, the gameplay itself is great. The graphics are great for the art style. The lighting is great. All your items and tools have a purpose, and different types of armor give you different strategic uses. A great first impression.

This game is so unique I have never experienced anything like it. Reminds me of the days when 'Honey I Shrunk the Kids' was on VHS, for those of you who lived back in the day. In saying that I am slightly upset I have not found a giant oreo cookie yet (devs add the easter egg!) or maybe it's out there and I haven't quite found it!? But I have found many other landmarks that this yard seems to have in it. 

There are certain aspects of this game that just put a smile on my face because they are simply so unique and fresh. For example, blueberries. Some are on the ground, some are in trees, take your bow and knock em down, hit them to get the flesh or convert the flesh into berry leather to help make armor. The true sandbox nature of this game, if you see it, and there's access to that location right now, you will be able to get as far as you can on it that logically makes sense. For example I wanted to get on top of the bird feeder under the blueberry bush, I ran up the branches of the blueberry bush, across leaves, killed spiders in the bush along the way and ended up in the glorious bird bath, took a screen shot to share with all. 

This game is a ton of fun, and I play it single player so far. If you have friends, I am sure this is a blast with others. 

Optimization - it runs extremely smooth on my system. I am maxed on graphics, maxed on all else, FOV maxed, on 4K resolution and it is running extremely smooth, more smooth than some AAA releases, and this is a beta! The controls are easy to use, fluid and you master them quickly. The landscape is lush with detail, lots going on, but it runs very well, nearly flawlessly. Saves are quick and don't stutter the game, and loading a save game is nearly instant. 

Look forward to seeing more content. So far it has been very enjoyable.

**Edit: Want to add that I do not particularly like spiders. And Wolf Spiders where I live are much larger than these Wolf Spiders, thank God you haven't made them the size they are in the mid west! But though I find spiders to be a gross creature, I left the spiders on fully, and I think it adds that much more to the game.

Oh and there are spiders which somehow make people cry. Side note: Our fathers and grandfathers stormed Normandy beach, faced the Pacific Theater, North Africa and Polio, but this generation curls up and demands trigger warnings if they see a spider. We may be doomed.

 Anyway, the gameplay is good, but nothing special. The tiny size vs big is a fun gimmick, but the mechanics will need to grow tremendously to make this one to return to often. The guided missions are done well, it gives you an idea of your goals, although there is a lot of trial and error of course.  I have never been so frustrated just trying to build base walls that butt up against each other. I finally gave up on them. The bugs definitely have individual personalities, which is fun to figure out and respond to. Ladybugs will kick your ass if you aren't polite.

It is also nagware that forces you to say no to an xbox account every time you start.

Cons:
-a non-existent story in the story game

Pros:
- fresh wind to the survival games
- beautiful environment
- side quests
- something to explore

There is a risk of paying 30€. Development can stop (for example GRAV). For 30 € there are a lot of survival games but I was not as interested as this game.

Otherwise the crafting system and survival aspects are pretty good.  If you have ever heard of The Forest you will find a lot of similarities to this game.  Besides the obvious.  The game doesn't hold your hand or tell you what to do but instead is entirely open sandbox.

There are many different biomes that you won't notice until you get into them and can't see them from afar unless you are up high.  This adds a lot of variety to the game play.  Night time has yet to be anything worthwhile and not hard to avoid.  I haven't found a reason to go and explore during the night rather than the day.

It has quite a beautiful shader on the game and all the in game scenery and object/mobs look great, there's not too much to do besides beat up bugs and insects at the moment. i do like the streamlined building/crafting system. 

Pros:
.It's quite stunning with it's shaders and a decent day/night cycle.
.Has quite a few things to do and beat up for a very early access game.
.Requires thought and planning in to what you wanna build and set up and where
.Good amount of drops per item and NPC drop
.Ok combat, and my biggest winner, It HAS A BOW!
. Gathering systems are in place to gather water and sap easier


Cons:
.Lack of mobs and materials and items at the moment
.Not friendly to newcomers of survival games
.Water droplets are usually well out of reach unless you build up to grab them, or scout the floor in hopes of finding anything to drink

If you have ever played The Forest, and seen the classic movie ""Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"", Just kinda blend the two. I have not found a way to put a saddle on an ant, and this saddens me, though.

I see amazing potential, and if the developers read these reviews, can I recommend a praying mantis as a boss encounter? 

Pro tip: Lady bugs are chill. Unless you hit them.
I also tried to jump on ones back. Do. not. Do. This.

17,74461058,english,"Main thoughts: This game is great and i am having a great time playing it. it is just like hunny i shrunk the kids made into a video game. you're a child trying to survive in a person's yard while you are the size of an ant. you have to find sources of food and water as well as defend yourself from the many insects that lurk in the grass. you can build a base or multiple bases if you choose to do so and learn new crafting ideas as you gain new materials to craft with. everything that you find seems to have a use. while this game is still early access and is by no means a complete game, there is still a lot to do and explore in what they have made so far. 

Pros: 
-a nice crafting system that will surely grow as more gets released
-various insects with different behaviors
-a unique game idea that was implemented well
-multiple difficulty levels to choose from to suit your play style
-an ""arachnophobia mode"" that allows you to make spiders look less spider like if you are afraid of spiders
-even though it is in early access it still feels like a full survival game (not including story)
-not everything is trying to kill you. 

Cons:
-because it is early access there are bound to be bugs (not the insect kind). if you want to store food be aware that it will attract ants and they will be bale to reach it seemingly regardless of where you put it. i had my food stored in a container 3 stories off the ground and in a secluded room. ants were still able to break into the container and steal food even while they were on the ground and the container was behind a wall. 
-SO MANY SPIDERS. spiders are one of the more difficult things to kill (at least they were for me) and they are way too common in my opinion. 
-while you can craft different armors from all of the creatures you kill, it didn't seem to me like one was better than another one, at least not by a significant amount. they do allow for different abilities though
-at the moment there does not seem to be a way to increase your personal inventory (that i found) which fills up rather quickly and equipped items occupy inventory slots as well
-though i am not sure the game really needs one, there is no fast travel system. i think it would be cool to add the ability to fast travel between the different science stations that you find

Final thoughts:
This game is definitely fun and i look forward to what will be added and how the world might change. even though i finished the ""story"" of the early access game rather quickly, the game did not feel finished. if you like survival games where you can build and craft and you don't mind insects then i would suggest getting this game.

The buggiest game I've ever played. 10/10

-Early access, so far from feature complete as of this writing. Features are changing and being tweaked as development progresses.

-Written for console apparently, but absolutely PC friendly, top to bottom. Feels like a PC game.

-Beautiful, fun and light graphical style. Distant objects blurred on my system with no setting to modify that, but what I [i]can[/i] see is spectacular.

-Decently graduated combat complexity. Winning strategies for different play styles so far. Many simplistic foes, a few truly terrifying ones. All manageable with multiple strategies. Some rather complex, but simpler strategies can be made to work as well. Currently has a foe health reset function that is annoying as all getout if you're trying to plink big-bads, but as I've said, there's more than one way to skin a bombardier beetle.

-Crafting and resource gathering galore. Kinda the meat and potatoes of the game. Virtually everything in the game is a resource of some description, with very few exceptions. *cough* I'm looking at you tree bark roof tiles and wood stump splinters. (neither exist)

-Epic base building. At this point simplistic in ways compared to some of my favs but definitely serviceable. You can build a nice home with a variety of structural materials at least. There are enough furnishings to clog it up a little at this point, but hoping for more, and more material variety in furnishings. 

-Looks like it's going to be best with friends but I've had a blast solo so far.  Multiplayer is in progress, but available. Keep your ear to the ground on that one, it appears to be priority one.

-Plagued by bugs. Swarms, HORDES. This title is literally infested with bugs. Squish them until your heart is content. (I have actually hit a precious few software bugs in singleplayer, we'll see how these are handled as development progresses. It's Obsidian, I have a great deal of faith.)

73,74425652,english,"True there are some issues. Sure there is basically just a tutorial for the story mode. But with a team like Obsidian, and what we have already, this game is going to just keep getting better and better with each monthly update. 
The base building is fun, can't wait to see what else the devs have planned to add to it in the future! 
Combat can be a bit janky, with bugs getting stuck on terrain, but on reading interviews with the devs, they have plans later to work on combat and pathing for insects. But on the whole it's fine for an early build of the game. 
Grounded is a great foundation to what will, I'm sure will be, an amazing game. 

Just be aware, this is early access, so my advice, if you can't handle the fact there may be bugs (not just the insect kind) and there may issues, even the occasional game breaking problem, DO NOT buy an early access game. 

Remember this is not how the game is always going to be. Devs probably already know the majority of your issues within a couple hours of a patch going live, and will be trying to fix them.

The atmosphere is soothing and relaxing, as long as spiders aren't trying to eat your bum.
It is easy to get immersed and lose hours just cutting down grass to build a makeshift home to protect yourself from the ants and larva that wander around.
And it's not overly difficult and grindy like other survival games (Yes, I am looking at you, ARK).
Even the great menacing Wolf Spider can be beat with relative ease once you get fully used to the mechanics.
There are only a few cons that I have, and they may or may not be patched in the future.
1. The inventory space is heckin small, and it isn't fully optimized. 
    A. Stack sizes goes from 10 for most items, to 20 for smaller items like arrows. And armor and weapons that are equipped to you or your hotbar takes up an inventory slot. This means your inventory gets really full, really fast. And you'll spend a lot of time shuffling things around trying to haul the best loot without leaving anything behind.
    B. Currently, you cannot transfer or drop a full stack at once. At least, not with a hot key. To transfer a full stack between inventories, you can drag the full stack,, but, as I said, there is no hotkey. 
2. Building bases is a bit wonky. When things like walls or scaffolding is trying to snap, it ends up snapping rapidly to different snap points and can get a bit disorienting.

As of this current moment, I can't really think of any other cons. This game has serious potential! Give it a shot!",1597610040,1597610040,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True,76561198099976463,21,8,2851,0,903,1598490021

1. The Game is solid. I haven't encountered any bugs (hehe no pun intended) 
2. When the game does finally come to a full release they will most likely hike the price. 
3. Its a nice spin on the survival genre.  I enjoy the cartoony graphics, shrunken world and characters and overall concept.
4. Finally, The big issue I found in most negative reviews is that the content is limited and when you finish the hour or so story content that's available you're left with a shell of a game. This is TRUE. You can do small random missions for an NPC and continue building and crafting but that's it.  For some this is a deal breaker but for me it's a reason to keep coming back and working through the fresh content as its released.

Final thoughts: I believe its worth the $30 because I think it will only increase in price upon full release. They nailed the survival aspect and its nice to fight something other than a zombie.",1597546566,1597546566,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True,76561198080864089,155,3,693,0,206,1599918059

45,74378752,english,"Fantastic game! Haven't been sucked into a world like this for many moons.

PROS:
- Detailed and immersive world to explore. The map is full of fun surprises to encounter and lots of lore and currency collectables to find. Usually tucked away in some hidden area or accessible through a ""jump puzzle.""
- Graphics are pretty and it runs on high settings on my non-gaming, potato pc so it's very well optimised. Also less than 4gb filesize, how?
- The survival aspects are easy to live by once you work out where to find certain resources, adding just enough pressure to ensure you're watching your hunger/thirst meters but not constantly scavenging to stay alive. There's heaps of clever quality of life options that make things a lot easier once you learn them. (Trail markers are your friend and the smoothie station is awesome!)
- The combat is basic but fun. Melee fighting is satisfying and the weapons have a nice weight to their swings and allow you to block most attacks. Ranged fighting (bow, throwables) is less viable as it does very little damage (haven't got the Spider Bow yet which looks much more powerful) but still fun. Ranged is basically used to lure large enemies out or to ""cheese"" them from unreachable heights. There are status effects like stun, poison etc on more advanced weapons too. Overall it's much better than most survival games in this aspect.
- Crafting is simple and operates on an analysis system where you bring mats to a computer to unlock associated crafting recipes. It works and gives you an incentive to take on the more challenging bugs for access to higher tier recipes.

CONS:
- The story adds a lot of flavour to the world and is genuinely intriguing but there's next to none of it at this stage of development. What is there will leave you hanging for more story content badly so I can understand other reviewers taking a dark view of this. 
- Building is a bit of a mess at this stage. Objects can be placed as transparent blue ""place holder"" structures which lets you map out your base before you have the mats to actually construct it all (much like The Forest, it's great for being able to visualise your goals) but the placements of walls and floors etc is extremely hit and miss with where it will allow you to build and snap pieces together. Needs work but we still managed to make a pretty badass tree fort!

IS IT WORTH THE ASKING PRICE AT THIS STAGE OF EA?
If you're playing purely for the story content: No. The story seems like it will be awesome but at this stage it's just a tease of future content. Excited to see more.
If you're playing for the sandbox experience of most survival games: Yes, definitely. There's heaps of map to explore, items to find, crafting recipes to unlock and challenging bugs to conquer. If you're playing with a friend it's even better. The co-op is seamless and makes base building and tackling spiders etc a lot less daunting. There's also a bunch of character banter you'll miss if playing alone which gives the characters a bit more personality.

Hopefully that helps!",1597542834,1597542834,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,True,76561198243837526,114,17,1603,0,709,1598628736

59,74372713,english,"Grounded is a very pretty and very well made survival/exploration game.

It ticks all the boxes:

Nice graphics
Base building
Crafting
Hunting/Gathering
Progression (on things you can craft and build anyway)
Exploration

If you have ever played any of the really good survival crafting games on Steam (The Forest, Subnautica) then there's nothing really new here for you other than the setting.

I'd say as it is, it doesn't offer any more or any less than the existing survival crafting games already out, there's no new gameplay to be had here.

It is early access so I'm hoping obsidian can bring something new to the genre (other than the setting)

Maybe the ability to tame some of the bugs and ride them, maybe find a remote control car you can drive, maybe humans walking around the backyard mowing the lawn, maybe a decent storyline that is more than an hour or so long?

You can play alone or co-op with 3 other friends, select one of 4 unique characters, and set out on an miniaturized adventure in your own back yard, encountering all kinds of common insects such as worker ants, ladybugs, stinkbugs, spiders and more. Create home-bases using blades of grass and weeds, handcraft armor and weapons using the parts of that last bug you squashed, as you try to survive in the wilderness of your yard and uncover the truth of how you got there.

This game is early-access and is not complete, but there is enough content in-game to keep you interested for multiple hours. There is unlimited potential with how the developer can steer this game, the map is still being worked on, and new creatures and content are expected to be released by the end of August. 

The base building is similar to ""The Forest"" where, when you chop down a blade of grass, it will break into individual pieces for you to haul off to your base. You can craft a variety of different stations and utilities to help you along your way, such as a spider web rain catcher to help you catch water droplets, or lanterns made out of sprigs and sap. You can create unique armor sets and weapons that come with passive set bonuses using bug parts and other resources, forcing you to venture deeper into the yard to fight more difficult creatures. 

The story is incomplete at this time, but allows daily missions that reward a resource that allows you to research new blueprints and schematics. The resource can be found while exploring the map, or by analyzing resources in many of the research sites that have been left around the yard.",1597528811,1597528854,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True,76561197990633361,161,2,2394,0,1272,1599632271

The game is diverse enough that if you do want to grind, you can put in the time, but can be casual enough, you can do small sessions and still have fun. I do recommend having a friend or two to play with, trying to have a nice base AND do the exploring can be a bit taxing solo. 

Cons: I've had a couple small bugs, nothing game breaking but required a server restart a couple times (enemy creature empty health bar gets stuck on my screen), (an Ant appeared to steal from chests, and seemed to give the items back too me, when I went to put them back in chests, some of the items became invisible (we're still there, but couldn't see them).  However a quick exit and relaunch of the hosting multiplayer fixed it. 

Wishes: have ways to make players a little more sustainable against the bigger creatures (spiders, beetles), perhaps stuff like ""Acorn armor gives a boost against spider bites because they're not designed to bite thru an acorn shell"" or stuff of the like; otherwise it's a gorgeous game, well made, excited to see what's to come.

First off I have to admit that the $29.99 price tag for an EA game on its first day of release nearly made me pass it up. However, that being said. I honestly think that it's the best ~$30 I have spent on a game for a very, [b]very[/b] long time. Take that with some context, on Steam alone I have 279 games with 404 DLC's. On top of that I have Epic Store, EA Games Store, Bethesda Store and Blizzard Store games plus at least a hundred other titles that don't fit into any of those. So [i]Grounded[/i] has a [u]lot[/u] of competition to earn that statement.

Now it is true that the game has limited [u]storyline[/u] content at the moment, which for having been out for less than 3 weeks (18 days since it's first availability as an EA game) it is still way more than I have seen with some other titles in a close price range. Heck, there are quite a few games out there of the same vein that have been years in EA development, cost as much and still have less storyline. [b]But[/b] here's the thing, [u]everything[/u] else about the game is well fleshed out and well polished already! It can only get better from here. (Which by the way they already have their first couple of patches out. already!)

And a great thing that I have never seen before in an EA title (at least not done this well) is when you reach the end of the into storyline there is an NPC that has daily quests and objectives as well as blueprints you can unlock from the the science earned in those quest, so there is still a lot more gaming to do before the next storyline update!

With the high quality they put out on literally day 1, being superior to a lot of multi-year EA games in the same price range I definitely expect huge things from this very tiny game! 

[b][u]TLDR:[/u][/b] Within the top 5 of the 279 Steam games I own. [b][u]Well[/u][/b] worth the mildly high entry for an EA game. I will be buying copies for my friends.

27,73671764,english,"The game has the potential to be very good.  However, the game as it is now has a very VERY LONG list of bugs.  A good portion of these bugs are even game breaking.  

If you are going to play this game with friends, I would suggest you hold off until the devs fix the multiplayer issue.  Right now, you may not even be able to join your friends session as it will not show up in the multiplayer directory.  

Next, there is a point where the day/night cycle will break, leaving you at the same exact time of the day indefinitely.  This can be problematic if you're playing in the night time, as it will be permanently dark.

Now the Larva Swarms.  After a good amount of time passes, your base will start getting attacked by larvae.  As time passes, the swarms get bigger.  It gets to the point where there are too many larvae and your fps gets killed.

The game is good concept is good.  It's just really REALLY buggy.  I don't recommend playing it now.  As I have heard, the devs will only update this game monthly.  That may even include fixes for the bugs stated above.  This does not give me confidence that these issues will be resolved quickly.  I would suggest that you wait a year before picking this game up, unless you intend to work with the devs on identifying the bugs.

As the game improves, I may change my review to ""recommended"".  As of now, I do not recommend picking up this game.

UPDATE:  It seems the devs have listened and made some fixes!  So far, the only thing I'm having issue with are the crashes mid-game and time stopping.  I'll be happy to revise my review once these are fixed.

UPDATE 8/14/20:  It seems they fixed some of the respawning bugs.  However at the moment, Whenever you harvest something, the grass/mushroom/etc the model still remains intact.  That means that after cutting down grass, you'll still see the model as if it hasn't been cut in the first place.  The game is slowly improving, but still not worth the 30 dollars because that's too high for something released on its early stages.

                  I absolutely love this game so far, it may lack in some areas but it is just an early alpha release. 

   I would like to point out one small change that i would really love to see, and that is the ability to dual wield. Using the larva dagger and the Spider fang dagger in conjunction would be an amazing thing in this game.

  The ability to switch between a maul to block, and back to daggers to some really good dps, or just have one person use the two dagger/swords and one use a maul to tank to have some more fun. 

  Just something to play around with and not just have a torch in the 'weak hand' or 'off-hand' slot. I believe this would create a more fun experience for all as a different way to do combat.

UPDATE To UPDATE: Some glitches solved and new ones introduced. It is still very broken and my games crashes every 20 minutes now. I think I would rate this a ""meh"" sideways thumb. Buy it after a couple of more patches.

UPDATE: Patch 0.1.1 Solved some of the worst problems. 

Fun concept and a very petty game. I am giving this a thumbs up only because I expect the dev will be adding a ton of content and upgrades in the future. Crafting needs to be fleshed out bigly as it is very limited and I can think of a dozen things to add off the top of my head. For god sake change it so equipped items do not take up backpack space.  I'm sure in six months the game will have major changes. Now you are going to have to deal with the fact that you are alpha testing a half finished glitch fest of a game. If you can't get over that then don't buy it as it is kinda broken in its current state. 

So I haven't done a delete and reinstall yet, but one more glitched new game and it's happening. This sounds like a no review, and honestly it sorta is. The thumbs up is for loving the concept, the look, and having a great time with it for the first 30 hours or so before glitchfest started.

The character choices are great although i would like to see light customization, maybe something like a hair color change or t shirt change. The story is still progressing so it is very short at the moment but i would love to have maybe a journal that shows what ur currently doing with maybe a tip on where to go or a short explanation to look at. The builiding aspect of the game is really cool but i will say i do wish that resources especially weeds themselves would respawn faster so that base building and expanding is more worth the grind to do. Also  being able to place things is a bit glitchy and should be looked at. I would also like to see more decoration items that are craftable like tables, rugs, a real bed or hammock, ways to connect multiple floor like elevators or bridges, etc.. just to give us more options of things to build for us creative people. Now onto the map! The map is giant and there is still areas that are incomplete and I cant wait for that but i really am hoping that there is some type of transportation with something like mounts. being able to ride a lady bug or wolf spider and tame them would just make the travel time and maybe even material hauling alot better. With mounts and maybe taming animals i would then want to see more base building options so that the bugs will have a space of their own so like new fences that hold bugs or maybe a fence that tame bugs don't attack something along those lines. i know the other labs are inaccessible right now but ppl are glitching into them and creating their own lore so i would love for those to be opened up so that we can experience that without having to glitch into them. with the logs i think that there should be a 1 out of 11 or how ever many there are that way we know there is more story that we haven't collected yet.  i also know that the ant eggs are glitched so if we could make those spawn more or maybe have to do something to trigger them that would be great because currently i've looked 10 times and haven't found a single one. i could probably go on for hours with things i love from the game and things that i want to see from the game! the game is fantastic and is still in its very early stages and i just cant wait for more things to come out so that i might waste many more hours of my life on it :) if ur sketchy on survival games or just this game in general go over to xbox game pass and grab the game for free then if its something you love come on over to steam or xbox which ever and purchase the game that way ur supporting the amazing people who are developing this game! thank you for taking the time to read this and GL on ur gaming experience!!!!",1597418779,1597418779,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,True,76561198272523031,84,4,2566,0,2458,1598634497

Having said that, it's pretty well fleshed out for the stage it's in of development, and I have only run into one bug regarding the physics of plants launching me.

Not a lot of story to it at the moment, gives you a taste, but ends early.  Not a hugely diverse ecosystem of plants, bugs, consumables, tools nor armor, but what's there is functional, and even at this stage (being that its in alpha 0.1.2) has given me a few hours of enjoyment, which is more than I can say for most early access survival games.  

This is Obsidian we're talking about here.  They turned the shitty engine that bethesda built and made the best game in the fallout series (Yeah yeah, 1 and 2 purists, we get it.  You're old, and nostalgia is a powerful thing).  Its probably going to be pretty good later down the line.  I'm willing to take the risk in buying it now, and see where it goes.  At least they're a reliable studio.

41,74274414,english,"Im being forced to speak, so instead i will just copy and paste an epic poem.

He came a far road, was weary, found peace,
and set all his labors on a tablet of stone.
He built the rampart of Uruk-the-Sheepfold,
of holy Eanna, the sacred storehouse.

See its wall like a strand of wool,
view its parapet that none could copy!
Take the stairway of a bygone era,
draw near to Eanna, seat of Ishtar the goddess,
that no later king could ever copy!

Climb Uruk’s wall and walk back and forth!
Survey its foundations, examine the brickwork!
Were its bricks not fired in an oven?
Did the Seven Sages not lay its foundation?

[A square mile is] city, [a square mile [date-grove, a square mile is
clay-pit, half a quarter mile the temple of Ishtar:
[three square miles] and a half is Uruk’s expanse.

[See] the tablet-box of cedar,
[release] its clasp of bronze!
[Lift] the lid of its secret,
[pick] up the tablet of lapis lazuli and read out
the travels of Gilgamesh, all that he went through.

Surpassing all other kings, heroic in stature,
brave scion of Uruk, wild bull on the rampage!
Going at the force he was the vanguard,
going at the rear, one his comrades could trust!

A mighty bank, protecting his warriors,
a violent flood-wave, smashing a stone wall!
Wild bull of Lugalbanda, Gilgamesh, the perfect in strength,
suckling of the august Wild Cow, the goddess Ninsun!

Gilgamesh the tall, magnificent and terrible,
who opened passes in the mountains,
who dug wells on the slopes of the uplands,
and crossed the ocean, the wide sea to the sunrise;

who scoured the world ever searching for life,
and reached through sheer force Uta-napishti the Distant;
who restored the cult-centers destroyed by the Deluge,
and set in place for the people the rites of the cosmos.

Who is there can rival his kingly standing,
and say like Gilgamesh, ‘It is I am the king’?
Gilgamesh was his name from the day he was born,
two-thirds of him god and one third human.

It was the Lady of the Gods drew the form of his figure,
While his build was perfected by divine Nudimmud.

* * *

A triple cubit was his foot, half a rod his leg.
Six cubits was his stride,
… cubits the front part of his …

His cheeks were bearded like those of …,
the hair of his head grew thickly [as barley.]
When he grew tall his beauty was consummate,
by earthly standards he was most handsome.

In Uruk-the-Sheepfold he walks [back and forth,]
like a wild bull lording it, head held aloft.
He has no equal when his weapons are brandished,
his companions are kept on their feet by his contests.
The young men of Uruk he harries without warrant,
Gilgamesh lets no son go free to his father.
By day and by night his tyranny grows harsher,
Gilgamesh, [the guide of the teeming people!]

It is he who is shepherd of Uruk-the-Sheepfold,
[but Gilgamesh] lets no [daughter go free to her] mother.
[The women voiced] their [troubles to the goddesses,]
[they brought their] complaint before [them:]

‘[Though powerful, pre-eminent,] expert [and mighty,]
[Gilgamesh] lets [no] girl go free to [her bridegroom.]’
The warrior’s daughter, the young man’s bride,
to their complaint the goddess paid heed.

The gods of haven, the lords of initiative,
[to the god Anu they spoke] …:
‘A savage wild bull you have bred in Uruk-the-Sheepfold,
he has no equal when his weapons are brandished.

‘His companions are kept on their feet by his contests,
[the young men of Uruk] he harries without warrant.
Gilgamesh lets no son go free to his father,
by day and by [night his tyranny grows] harsher.

‘Yet he is the shepherd of Uruk-the-Sheepfold,
Gilgamesh, [the guide of the] teeming [people]
Though he their shepherd and their [protector,]
powerful, pre-eminent, expert [and mighty,]
Gilgamesh lets no girl go free to her bride[groom.]’

The warrior’s daughter, the young man’s bride:
To their complaint the [Anu] paid heed.

They summoned Aruru, the great one:
‘You, Aruru, created [mankind:]
now fashion what Anu has thought of!

‘Let him be a match for the storm of his heart,
let them vie with each other, so Uruk may be rested’
The goddess Aruru heard these words,
What Anu had thought of she fashioned within her.

The goddess Aruru, she washed her hands,
took a pinch of clay, threw it down in the wild.
In the wild she created Enkidu, the hero,
offspring of silence, knit strong by Ninurta.

All his body is matted with hair,
he bears long tresses like those of a woman:
the hair of his head grows thickly as barley,
he knows not a people, nor even a country.

Coated in hair like the god of animals,
with the gazelles he grazes on grasses,
joining the throng with the game at the water-hole,
his heart delighting with the beasts in the water.

A hunter, a trapper-man,
did come upon him by the water-hole.
One day, a second and then a third,
he came upon him by the water-hole.
When the hunter saw him, his expression froze,
but he with his herds — he went back to his lair.

[The hunter was] troubled, subdued and silent,
his mood [was despondent,] his features gloomy.
In his heart there was sorrow,
his face resembled [one come from] afar.

The hunter opened [his mouth] to speak, saying [to his father:]
‘My father, there was a man came [by the water-hole.]
Mightiest in the land, strength [he possesses,]
[his strength] is as mighty [as a rock] from the sky.

‘Over the hills he [roams all day,]
[always] with the herd [he grazes on grasses,]
[always] his tracks [are found] by the water-hole,
[I am afraid and] I dare not approach him.

‘[He fills in the] pits that I [myself] dig,
[he pulls up] the snares that I lay.
[He sets free from my grasp] all the beasts of the field,
[he stops] me doing the work of the wild.’

[His father opened his mouth to] speak, saying to the hunter:
‘[My son, in the city of] Uruk [go seek out] Gilgamesh!
……… in his presence,
his strength is as mighty [as a rock from the sky.]

‘[Take the road,] set your face [toward Uruk,]
[do not rely on] the strength of a man!
[Go, my son, and] fetch [Shamhat the harlot,]
[her allure is a match] for even the mighty!

‘[When the herd comes] down [to] the water-hole,
[she should strip off] her [raiment to reveal] her charms.
[He will] see her, and he will approach her,
his herd will spurn him, [though he grew up ] amongst it.’

[Paying heed] to the advice of his father,
the hunter went off, [set out on the journey.]
He took the road, set [his face] toward Uruk,
Before Gilgamesh the king [he spoke these words:]

‘There was a man [came by the water-hole,]
mightiest in the land, strength [he possesses,]
[his strength] is as mighty as a rock from the sky.

‘Over the hills he roams all [day,]
always with the herd [he grazes on grasses,]
always his tracks [are found] by the water-[hole,]
I am afraid and I dare not approach [him.]

‘He fills in the pits that I [myself] dig,
he pulls up the snares [that I lay.]
He sets free from my grasp all the beasts of the field,
he stops me doing the work of the wild.’

Said Gilgamesh to him, to the hunter:
‘Go, hunter, take with you Shamhat the harlot!

‘When the herd comes down to the water-hole,
she should strip off her raiment to reveal her charms.
He will see her, and will approach her,
His herd will spurn him, though he grew up amongst it.’

Off went the hunter, taking Shamhat the harlot,
they set out on the road, they started the journey.
On the third day they came to their destination,
hunter and harlot sat down there to wait.

One day and a second they waited by the water-hole.
then the herd came down to drink the water.
The game arrived, their hearts delighted in water,
and Enkidu also, born in the uplands.

With the gazelles he grazed on grasses,
joining the throng with the game at the water-hole,
his heart delighting with the beasts in the water:
then Shamhat saw him, the child of nature,
the savage man from the midst of the wild.

‘This is he, Shamhat! Uncradle your bosom,
bare your sex, let him take in your charms!
Do not recoil, but take in his scent:
he will see you, and will approach you.",1597379659,1597379659,True,0,1,0.476190477609634399,1,True,False,True,76561197992269655,141,25,517,0,156,1597449069

I hardly ever just go out and buy a game based off of Part 1 of watching a video, but I was so intrigued that I went ahead and bought it ASAP. Now I can't even edit the videos I record fast enough because I record for so long.

I can not wait to see where this game goes and I hope there's a lot more content in the future!

I played this solo and it was still very fun. Some games make co-op almost required for a good time, but I thoroughly enjoyed myself, and am continuing to!

Finding new things to analyze for new crafting recipes is always exciting. The game really isn't super grindy, which I love because that gets old to me. The enemies are interesting and there are a pretty good amount, definitely would love to see even more. There's so much more content than I was expecting walking into the game, though you can get to ""the end""
 so far, fairly easily, but even after that, there's still more progressing you can do. I like that you still have to be careful, even with the best gear, just gets easier to deal with enemies but never too op.

The only quirks I have is that I have a texture bug in my armor, it all looks like acorn armor now for some reason, probably a simple fix. The enemies are typically very easy to outsmart by being up high enough to be out of their reach but keep them close enough that they think they can get you, but can't (AKA if you've ever hunted Giants in Skyrim at an early level, you know exactly what to do). Also some of the normal, smaller insects spawn in rocks sometimes and it's just a very, very insignificant bug, but i thought i'd mention it.

Also a side note, I personally find it a little annoying that as soon as an enemy de-aggros, it's health instantly replenishes. I was taking on a wolf spider and it healed 3 times. Same deal with a lady big I took on early on, you might laugh but they're tanky lil sons of guns. Just a personal minor annoyance, most of the time it's not a problem.",1597373417,1597373417,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True,76561198378863484,72,9,2634,0,638,1600278465

I paid $30 for the game that means I have paid $0.35 per hour of playing this and have gotten great entertainment from it. You really can't beat that.

The mechanics are simple enough to be enjoyable and complicated enough not to be boring. They did a really good job on this game. The only other game I can compare this to  is Subnautica. 

I can't recommend this game enough. It is so much fun to run through the grass looking for a dandilion to chop down and once you chop it down grab the weed stems and head back to base and worry about the  spiders sneaking up on you and killing you super fast if your unprepaired. But if you do die just running back and grabbing your stuff and continuing on. No major time lost!

The base building is fun to do because it's simple and easy to build something nice. I'm not super creative and I still feel like I'm building a really cool hut on the fence by the Oak tree. 

Give it a try it's one of the top three purchases I've made on steam!

Also did I mention they've patched it twice already so it doesn't seem like the devs are just collecting money and have forgot about the game. they are currently actually patching and say they are adding content monthly!

All bugs health will refill if you disengage for even a moment.

29,74252626,english,"As the game is not fully released but in early access, I will give a shorter review. Games in early access are likely to change during development, due to the interaction between devs and players with player feedback.

First and most importantly, Game play. 9/10
If you do not look up how to do everything and explore the world yourself as games were meant to be enjoyed, there is plenty of hours of content to be had here, even in it's early state. Base building is wonderful, with only a few stressful issues, that are likely to be ironed out. Resource gathering is fun, but some things are currently broken. Fighting feels great, a variety of enemies all with their own fighting patterns. Exploration is amazing. So much to discover on your own, especially if you do not look it up before hand. 

Secondly, Sounds and Music. 9/10
Adding depth and substance to the visuals, the sounds are really immersive. The music is both soothing at times, and sets the mood for other situations. The sound effects are also appealing. Walking along peacefully, then hearing the chilling call of the wolf spider that found prey can be pleasantly unsettling, causing me to jump more than once. Also B.U.R.G. L with his friendly robo-voice is cute.

Third, Multiplayer. 7/10
Honestly the rating on this one left me unhappy as I did not get to test the multiplayer out as much as I would've liked. What I did get, was easy use of voice chat, and fairly lag free game play, and pretty quick fun. The biggest issue I had was trying to connect at first, and having to open xbox live on pc, which I had never needed so never did before.

Fourth, and least important, but many would argue the opposite, Graphics. 10/10
While I care least of graphics in a game, Grounded has made me bug out over the different visuals that are offered. The floating particulates in the air, the depth of view haze, the lighting and shadows, all phenomenal. While not going in a realistic view, and leaning more towards a cartoonish style. I find it pleasing to look at, easy to differentiate, and perfect for the vibe the game gives off as a whole.

Overall, this game has great potential. Currently as of writing this there are some bugs that make it difficult to do certain things, but not really game breaking. Even in it's early access state, it does have a ton of content available right now. Not comparable to a full game yet, but still plenty to do, and prepare for future updates. I have over 100 hours in game, and still going. Anyone who says this game does not have more than a few hours content likely just looks up everything first. I do not recommend playing this game, or any other game that way. You get more out of it if you experience it yourself. I do recommend this game as a great source of survival/building/exploration fun.",1597341946,1597341946,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True,76561198199515533,42,1,21206,140,7608,1601935309

EDIT: this was negative review, i changed it to positive because of the survival aspect of the game is very solid, there are tons of stuff to do in the survival aspect of the game. However, I'm very upset still because of the way this was released with the premium price.

As you can see i have played 34 minutes of the game and i already finished it.

it has A LOT of potential, i hope they release big updates and not just trickle some small updates. Since it clearly needs a lot more content than this.

This is not early access, this looks like a demo you would play for 30 minutes to check if you like the feel of the game.

The reality is it's not worth the current price tag. There's about 1h of story line right now. You might be able to squeeze 10-15 hours out of it with base building and trying to get higher tier gear. Basically, If you're paying for this game, it's to finance it's development, in the hopes of it being awesome later. This would be fine by my if it was made by a small indie studio, but it's not.

In the one hour I tried playing this morning, the game crashed 7 times, freezing my pc, killing the process in task manager being the only way of getting out of it. At least the developers are apparently working on the bugs, there's a list on the community hub, my issue is listed there, all good right?

68,74238890,english,"This game exceeds every expectation I had. Even for early access very unfinished game, it's extremely fun,but not without its quirks and hiccups. 
First off, the building isn't the worst I've seen, but could be improved greatly. 
When I log out and log back in,the walls on my base are clipping through the doorway where they were previously not.
Also, somehow after putting walls up, those pesky ants always find a way through them and to my storage crates as if there's no wall there at all.
The dew collector only collects water when first built, after that good luck.
Dandelions grow very sparingly, I would have liked to have seen them respawn a bit faster considering almost everything is built with them.
Some of the Bugs IE: Bombardier Beetle and Wolf Spider are a bit OP even with the tier 2 weapons and acorn armor IMO.
The story mode as is literally lasts 45 minutes tops, so if you're looking for an engaging story right now this isn't it.
But what it lacks in story for the moment, It makes up for it with fun scavenging of Science points and resources.
Also, I like that the Devs included a nice 3 quests a day of various tasks to keep us busy until full release.
Overall I give this game 3.5 stars as is already,I cant wait until full release to really dig into this gem.

70,74238496,english,"For an early access game, Grounded has surprisingly few bugs and issues. Gameplay is solid and fun. There's always something to build, farm or kill and the insects are a real threat on higher difficulties. 

Positive:
- Polished Graphics & Interface
- Easy to learn
- Base Building (build a complete base layout, add the building materials later)
- Nighttime is spooky as hell
- Fast paced dodge/block combat (with tougher insects)
- Cool armor with set bonusses
- Big Spiders

Negative:
- At some points building materials will drop through the floor if you put it down
- You can build a base floating in the sky
- Hard to see which savegames are mine (they all have the same icon, especially if multiple players use the same avatar/kid)
- Gnats are VERY annoying (I guess that's a bug [i]and[/i] a feature)
- Big Spiders

Too bad a lot of players don't understand what early access means and write negative reviews complaining about lack of content.

Things id like to see changed:
1. When putting armor it should not take up inventory space when you are wearing it. If anything some armors should add storage space (extra pockets, ext.)
2. It would feel more  Immersive if we could make are own characters.
3. Being able to explore houses, it would be awesome to find like a paperclip and use it as a sword or things like that or even run into a mouse that becomes a mount?

**Edit!** As of the first patch they have already begun fixing many of the cons on my list.

Cons:
          -*Fixed*AI can border on brutal. IE spiders seem to be able to track you for quite a long

          -*Fixed*Also waking up to a 10 pack of larva on day two in single player mode seemed 
            a bit excessive.
          -The story as of now while good so far, can be completed in 30-hour, as such getting 
            more than a handful of hours out of this game currently will come down to how much 
            fun you can make for yourself building and exploring with friends.

[quote] PLEASE NOTE: This review is/was written when this game was in/is still in Early Access. Think twice before buying/playing this game [/quote]

Grounded is a game developed by Obsidian Entertainment and published by Xbox Game Studios

The game offers some nice graphics, although some ugly glitches here and there, it is pleasant all the same

Grounded overall, however, is a fun game to play, and it does get boring if being played for a long time, but is a very good action adventure survival game and to play in short bursts

Hopefully they will add a simple LAN ability so a whole family can play without needing multiple Xbox Live accounts.  But leaving Xbox out of it:
Fun game - spiders are creepy as heck to hunt!
Gets intense - stay awake through the night, good fun
Creative crafting graphics - fun stuff to build but having furniture as art and therefore unable to interact is a bummer
Death is easy- if you get used to that it's a pretty cool game
Building is fun but sometimes aligning roof/corners/etc isn't simple.  It (the game) guesses at what you want most of the time and you have to build only the way it will allow you to build.  Creates very dull basic block shapes which are not very interesting to keep expanding.
Crafting items can get a bit vague on what you gain and what is needed (like with the Smoothie Mixer)

Fun game.  If you enjoy Minecraft you will feel right at home after some wandering around.  ALWAYS research when available!  Early stages so I am definitely looking forward to what they add/fix/change.

The only Xbox Live issue for multiplayer is amazingly annoying for those of us who have moved beyond the Xbox.  Not even a LAN setting for Steam clients (whole household of Steam Gamers).

57,73522681,english,"I'd say don't buy this console port.  
Do buy this game claiming to be a multiplayer coop.  It requires (nope) an Xbox Subscription to play coop.  (IT doesn't actually.. It only requires a Microsoft Account login, which you will have if you have windows installed. It just looks like it's demanding the xbox sub.)
It requires a Subscription just to send feedback ingame. (No you don't)

The UI is horrible.   There are some glitchy bugs.  

That said, the core gameplay in singleplayer on medium difficulty, is fun.  The atmosphere, sound effects and general horror level is exceptional, even if spiders don't scare you irl.. they will in this game.

This is an Xbox Console Port.. being sold on Steam Pc.. where you can only play Single player unless you take out a monthly subscription to access the multiplayer coop.  The game is £25.. $40.. it has about 20-30 minutes of story driven content.

And maybe 10-15 hours of make your own story content.  Completionist stuff etc.   If they release a steam mp coop version I'll change my review to a recommendation, until then.  I'd say no.  Unless you have an xbox sub.. in which case.. play it on your console.

Changing this to a Yes Review.  Turns out I was wrong about the multiplayer coop.

58,74197772,english,"Dear God! This game is REALLY good! There is a certain allure to a game that involves survival, crafting, and miniaturization and this game has all three. If you loved Honey, I Shrunk The Kids, you are going to love this. Currently the game is only $29 which isn't bad. Once they finish everything, they may increase the price to a understandable $60. For me, the game is worth every penny as is, and is only going to be improved as time goes on. Overall, this game is brilliant yet unfinished.

Pros:
- The crafting system is really polished for an unfinished game. The unlock system for new blueprints and schematics is directly connected to what you can find. This pushes you to explore rather than hole up in a safe place and get stagnant. 
- The current ""enemies"" (bugs) you encounter can range from the tiny aphids to big (to you) ladybugs. There is a definite adorability in seeing these bumbling ladybugs walk through your world yet it goes a long way to show your relative scale in the game when you see the grass (which are basically the size of trees relatively speaking) shift and BREAK as the bugs approach reminiscent of a dinosaur in Jurassic Park.
- The game does an amazing job of setting the mood and the *FEEL* of the game. There is an extreme element of sheer terror as your are running through the world exploring and come face to face with a MASSIVE wolf spider. If you are afraid of spiders, this game could EASILY be placed in the horror genre for you. To elaborate a bit more though, it's everything about the game that helps set the mood and pace. Even the landmarks in the game (such as the massive baseball which you see in the video along with the frog toy) seem to lend a since of credibility and a believable circumstance in an utterly syfy idea of being a child who is miniaturized in their back yard.
- Grounded is a BEAUTIFUL game! It's interesting that even when I'm running through the mud puddles that for the player may as well be a swamp, you still can't help but appreciate the details in the game world. Nothing extraneous or too over-the-top, just very well done. Yet the game is still in Early Access at the moment which means it can only get better. It's difficult to improve perfection, but I'm sure looking forward to it.

Cons:
- The game is simply unfinished. The quest line is fairly short (though it does give players a decent idea what they can expect from the game) so it can be finished EASILY in just a few short minutes. This may bother some players who need a structured quest line in order to enjoy a game. There's nothing wrong with that, if you are that type of gamer, but fair warning here. If you're looking for a strong story line game, perhaps wait a bit. There are some, shall we say, busy work (side quests) you can get from BURG.L, the robot from the intro video, but they are just that; they are short side quests. He rewards you with science points which are the in-game currency, but honestly there isn't much to use it for. All in all, the currently finished story line is fun but over too soon. If you have patience and don't mind waiting for updates (which I think is totally worth it) then this con shouldn't be a big deal.
- Currently, the game is a bit buggy (pardon the pun) and glitchy. This is ABSOLUTELY to be expected from a game that is technically still being developed. I have had crashes and glitches but nothing that completely ruins the experience.
- Since the game is unfinished, you will inevitably run across areas where you want to explore but can't until the game is updated a bit more. This can be extremely frustrating when you work hard to climb up somewhere to get into a structure that you saw from far away only to have the door to said structure be locked with no way to open it. However, this (in my opinion) just makes me all the more excited to enjoy the finished product.

All in all, the pros outweigh the cons in my opinion and that's not even factoring in that the ""cons"" will be corrected by future updates.

They've fixed the constant harassment from ants and larvae when building you base!  It's nice to come back to your base and have it still be there when you get back with more resources for the base.

This has lead me on a goal to build the largest structure in the front yard.  So far I have a 20 floor building that is just about even with the front porch of the house!  

Out side of that, I will say that the dew catcher is a waste of materials and time.  Ever since I installed the dew catcher, I've yet to see it catch any dew.  In fact, it's caught me in it's web more times than any dew has thought of being caught by it.  

So, hey Dev team, maybe make the dew catcher actually catch due, or call it something else! 

With the story mode being able to be beat in 20 minutes, and then the extra quests they give you to keep you busy for an extra 30-60 minutes, I still cannot recommend this game to any of my friends or family. 

Original Review:After 4 hours of gathering resources, following the very few quests/objectives available in the game. 

I built my beautiful two story base, complete with kitchen, living room, and a sweeeeeet trophy room.  I laid out my spike traps and other traps to prevent insects from bombarding my base for food and other supplies.

Feeling good about the work I had accomplished, I went to bed, and awoke to ants raiding my kitchen, and Larvae attacking me.  

I logged out, uninstalled the game and will await a patch/update.  

I wouldn't recommend this to any of my friends or family, $30 dollars is far too high a price for what you get.

84,74179171,english,"For the moment, fellow gamer, I'm not going to recommend you pay 30.00 for this game.

Grounded is a visual triumph with tremendous possibility. At best in its current form, you complete the storyline in an hour or less. One making what should have been an epic breakthrough, you are greeted with a prompt telling you that this is as far as they've gone so far in development, but promises there will be more in the future. 

Grounded is like having the very best pringle ever created with perfect flavor and texture, but there's only one in the can. It succeeds in leaving you wanting more- I would have eve bought new region unlocks it is that immersive- but, the game just ends. You can continue to build, explore and hunt, but this is simply a demo- and prior to playing 30 dollars, be aware it is a demo and that while the experience is an an amazing, albeit short-lived one, it is not a fully developed game in early access for polish, it has the opening chapter of the story, and you're done. It is not worth more than 10 dollars in it's current state. 

I am really frustrated with developers releasing demos at full retail cost. The concept of Early Access has become a fierce cash grab and enables developers to produce minimal content on their own terms, usually very slowly while they harvest money from the hopeful expectations of players. for may gamers, the cost of this game costs two hours of work- and from investment, they get an hour of content. 

 When the game is beyond a demo phase, I wil likely change this review, but I can't in good faith justify 30 dollars for an unfinished game- even leverage the all-to-common ""Early Access"" excuse often used.

Unfortunately, the storyline feels entirely separate from the sandbox survival, and neither of them are quite fleshed out enough. What I want to see in the future of Grounded is more things to craft and build for Sandbox and a more fleshed out campaign that isn't forced on the player...

Obviously this game is still in early access, and you can't blame them because the game needs to be fleshed out more. What you can blame them for however, is the Price. $30 for an early access game that's barren of content is too much. At this stage of development, it should cost $20 maximum.

Overall, it's fantastic fun, and I expect hundreds of hours played in the months to come!

My only nit pick would be to tone down the frequency of spiders, at least for early starters in the game or perhaps an area where they could be more frequent. Got killed quite a few times by them and didn't have any good weapons or tools yet to properly defend myself. Or at least bring in a way that if we hide somewhere or can't be seen for awhile, they move on so you aren't stuck in one place for forever waiting for it to go away. Also thought the water and hunger bars would deplete a little too fast or I was just focused on other things too long to not notice when it was starting to go down. Other than those two things though I am enjoying everything else, discovering new places and analyzing different objects to unlock more crafting recipes. I'm sure theres a lot more that will be fixed as time goes on and excited to see when it's all completed.

55,74149692,english,"This game is truly fun to play (early access), the game is based of off  the movie, ""Honey, I shrunk the kids - 1989"".

Pros:
Game looks really good
Multi player is fun to play with friends
Game play is smooth 
Can already start building your home, some armour and weapons
World takes some time to explore and more will be added
Insects are well made and dangerous 
Everything in the game is your enemy
Game doesn't help you at all (I personally like this)

Cons:
Story can be completed in 20 min if you don't explore
The house building can take some work
Night time isn't scary
Some sounds are very loud and some are soft
There are some glitches
Sometimes your items disappear if you drop them
You get hungry to fast for my taste

I've put a solid 30 hours in so far and I've seen pretty much everything at least vaguely, I haven't explored in depth some of the harder areas of the garden, and even areas I thought I knew quite well have been hiding secrets from me I only discover later in the game. Exploration is the best and biggest thing in this game, and growing up loving stories like The Borrowers and ""Honey I Shrunk the Kids"", the perspective is refreshing and exciting. You really feel tiny in this huge garden, where it can take almost full minute to sprint along the length of a rake's pole. 

There are lots of things I'd like to see, such as pet insects and bug mounts (would love to be able to ride a ladybird!), more resources and materials, more armour designs and weapons, more insects to fight, boats of some kind and water-related enemies maybe... I could go on and on, there is a lot of potential here and what the game already has is very fun and easy to sink time into.

One thing that almost made me not want to get this was the people saying lack of content vs price point was not fair at this point in time.  I disagree.  I understand that it doesn't have a huge amount of content in it.  But this is 100% an investment.  Obsidian is good at games, and this isn't a bad one.  I played this for 4 hours so far and I've really enjoyed it.  From spider jump scares to the way the small amount of story that was there was awesome and has me honestly drooling for more.  

One thing, personal preference though and in no way effects the review, is i don't like systems where you have a certain amount of times you can research items and then wait until a certain time to research more stuff.  It reminds me of Raft and i didn't like it in that game either.  It's not even a remote issue because they put multiple places you can research items at all with their own timer, but i'd prefer to just be able to research whenever i have new items.  Make it cost an item instead of making me wait until later, idc.

The story progression ends after about 15 minutes of play if you focus on it and don't worry about anything else. The story is also incomplete and pretty straight forward—get un-shrunk. What all this entails will only be known as the devs finish the game.

As for actual content that is readily available, there's a few good hours of fun to be had. Especially with friends. Once your base is built and in a pretty solid state, all you have left to do is explore and craft the best equipment you can—currently, not very much to choose from but definitely some potential given information you stumble upon in-game, like bee armor but no bees in game (at least none that I have seen).

There is also not very much to explore. The map is divided into a few different zones and about half of them are developed. Running around all of these developed areas could waste a few hours, but eventually you'll pretty much find everything you need and the drive to explore will diminish.

As of now, my only drive to play this game is meaningless challenges we give each other. Like ""kill everything"" or ""mow the lawn"". The game definitely has a lot of potential and this is probably the cheapest you will be able to get it for a long while. Just know before you buy that it IS still being developed, there are plans to expand the content (presumably as updates and not as DLC, but perhaps one day they will have those as well), and that the game has some broken mechanics that the devs have done a quick job fixing.

Known issues after first patch (0.1.1):
- Undeveloped areas have a few spots where you can fall off of the map, did not attempt to fall because I had some valuable items I wasn't willing to risk losing.
- Day/Night/Time progression sometimes stops on multiplayer mode, possibly when sleep is initiated by one player but not all. (Only happened 3 times so far, twice before first patch and once, briefly, after)

I had spent so much time trying to get it to work and I feel like those interested in this deserve to know an honest opinion when pulling the trigger on this game at its current price point as of 8/10/2020. 

This product isnt even close to being considered early access if you are marketing it as a Multiplayer experience.

I spent over 8 hours of time trying to configure this, using various fixes, trials, and options for connectivity. Staring into the screen, modifying command prompts, program exceptions, excecutible command modifications. Freezing, Crashing, Black Screens, Failed Xbox Connectivity, EVERYTHING, and I am unable to get it to work. Infact, now I am not even able to login to the Xbox login on the start screen. It is permanently stuck in OfflineUser mode when I am Online in Steam. 

GG's. You know rather than piggy back off of Microsoft's garbage Xbox Live and them trying to reinvent the wheel, how about you just have a regular online multiplayer queue system? You know, like 90% of the rest of the games on Steam. Should have just paid Steam directly upfront like most other gaming companies when it comes to having Steam manage the logistics of it, it's so much easier.

Lots of Indie companies making you look pretty terrible @Grounded

Bottom line, this is a beautiful looking game that is run by morons with an over zealous board of directors pushing for a quick buck. Surprise, another title desperate for revenue in order to justify its own slow gradual release on Steam. The greatest laugh is the fact that games are much cheaper to make then they were 20 years ago. Quit spoon feeding us bull$h1t game developers. 0/10 Until Multiplayer works.

86,74012547,english,"Revising my review after more time playing. I am mainly only focusing on the bugs/building aspect of the game due to it being early-access and complaining about the lack of a story is just silly.

The game is littered with bugs (no pun intended) that can quite literally ruin any further progression for your game. Simple things such as ants, weevils, and larva no-clipping through your base is one thing, but having items such as acorns, dandelions, and even bugs not spawning can keep you from getting any further in the game.

I have currently spent 9 hours on a singleplayer save (on Medium) and I honestly have been having a blast. However, I am now stagnated when it comes to continually building up my base and getting spare weapons/armor. The reason behind this is all due to acorns not respawning at all. This makes it impossible to store large amounts of materials as I am no longer capable of building chests, but rather the baskets which have half the amount of space alotted to them while also taking up almost the same amount of space. Another problem with continual base building is that I have an insanely hard time gathering weed stems due to the lack of respawning on the side of dandelions- so now I am forced to run across half the map in order to get weed stems, and if I want to pick up more than 5, I have to run back and forth repeatedly until I get them to my base. 

When it comes to content, I think there's a good start here. However, I would like to see MUCH more building options, as currently there isn't even an option for floors/ceilings (not counting the foundation due to that being limited to the ground), which makes two-story or higher buildings impossible.",1596952810,1597088370,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True,76561198015233207,189,12,1054,0,336,1597611664

6,74087445,english,"While the game is really fun and honestly, I never knew I can be afraid of a stink bug, still I can't wholeheartedly recommend it at this point in time. 

I really don't mind that the shortness of the story itself. It's just two quests, but I'm more annoyed by the issues. I've tried to play it with my friend and we discovered that while the host's game is reasonably okay but if you join as a client all hell breaks lose. Starting from holding two bows at the same time and not seeing where you aim, to teleporting bugs and not respawning resources. 

Pros:

- It's an absolute relief to finally play in a survival game where you are not supposed to be a hardcore survivor whos aim is to destroy monsters and/or zombies and stuff. It's really creative.
- Graphics are great, so much so that I got scared of bugs that I usually don't even notice climbing on me in real.
- Great characters, even when we don't know anything about them yet.
- Creative looking building pieces. 
- Wholesome world.

Cons:

- I know it's EA but I think they published it a bit sooner than when they should've. I mean only two quests for story? 
- Building system is really janky right now. When I try to place something it just jumps all over the place. Really hard to control it.
- A ton of bugs ... yeah I said it, ya happy?. Especially when I wasn't hosting. Stuff disappearing in ground, or from your inventory, teleporting enemies etc.
- Resources won't respawn. When we started playing, we saw some water bubbles on weed but after second login we never saw them again. We tried the Dew Collector too but after the first bubble, nothing. It can be worked around of course, but we noticed that some important building materials run out too. 

TL/DR:

While it looks truly awesome, I think the game should've stayed in incubation for a bit longer. I'm all about EA games and I understand there are bugs, but honestly I don't want to be the company's glorified alpha tester. 

I can't wait for the upcoming updates and to change my review, but right now I wouldn't recommend buying it, but keep it on your wishlist.

 Last patch broke the game to the point where playing is not worth it, how long until that is fixed is unknown and no info coming out about it as of now. 

   The game may very well be worth the price at some point in the future if a lot more content is added and reasons to play added. The base building is lovely but once done, well it is done. Other than that the only goal is to unlock better armour and kill a few more bugs, no real goal or aim  there. Sandbox... well not really any reason to keep building the same sort if thing or kill the same critters over and over so it is not a game that seems to offer the open world sandbox feel.

12,74084333,english,"Survival games may no longer be in vouge, but that hasn't stopped their evolution one bit. Obsidian has delivered in [i] Grounded [/i] a survival experience that is both new and fresh, and also built on the foundations of other excellent survival games. Though the game is in early access, and is unfinished, it is both remarkably playable and remarkably stable.

The game takes the building mechanics from [i] The Forest [/i], with buildable structures and platforms, constructed from stems and blades of grass that you carry over your shoulder. The recipes are not resource-intensive enough to make construction annoying (looking at you ARK), but building a sick base does take a rewarding amount of time. The sound design is excellent, you know what is creeping around that next corner, and it fills you with [b] absolute terror [/b], building towards the moment when the wolf spider jumps out of the grass at you, and you have the best heart attack since you met Sammy from [i] Subnautica [/i]. The music is thematic, and really drives home the sense of wonder, and the whole yard feels alive with clicks, chirps, and footfalls.

The difficulty is just right, the enemies are strong enough that killing one feels like a real accomplishment, and if you miss too many blocks or get cornered you are dead, but the attacks are well-telegraphed and have acceptable hitreg. No bug I have fought yet (so everything but the super secret boss and the wolf spider) has had so much health that the fight was a drag, and the actual melee mechanics are top-notch. Blocks and Parrying are key to most fights, and the lack of block-cancelling adds an element of risk-reward to making one more strike. Melee is also encouraged due to the (albeit funky) pathing, that leads enemies being attacked from an unreachable vantage to flee, forcing either a long kiting battle (suicide against spiders) or a good old scrap. 

The atmosphere and environment is beautiful, and the sense of wonder from staring up into the sky through grass as tall as trees, or climbing inside a soda can, is refreshing and new. You feel like prey, you are afraid to go out at night, but you never feel so powerless you are confined to your base. The spiders are scary, really scary, but if you engage on your terms they feel conquerable, which is a super rewarding balance of predator and prey mentality that always has you on your toes. The lighting is gorgeous especially since many things are translucent, though it still needs a little touch of polish, the sunglow through grass walls is especially beautiful.

Now for the criticisms:
The motion blur is totally goofy, even slow moving objects such as dust particles and viewmodels will sometimes have afterimages.
Lighting also needs a little polish, namely the same translucent effect that I love so much in the game. Some models such as the aphid roast will have 'stepping' in the light transfer from the fireplace. The game can also have some really bad haze issues, which may be an intended feature but looks unnatural.
The armor dummy is currently bugged, and will sometimes 'eat' armor upon reloading a save.

The biggest issues I have experienced are with clipping, pathing, and spawing of insects.
Bugs like to either spawn or clip into rocks or other pieces of terrain, my current save has a wolf spider stuck in a rock that has almost killed me by striking through the rock. For a time there were very few worker ants, with many of them also being stuck in rocks, but they seemed to have been respawned, and now they are everywhere in large numbers. Bugs will get caught on twigs, short trenches, or other natural features, which can make some fights just arrow cheese (still better than ARK). I currently cannot find any ladybugs, I assume that they are all stuck inside rocks as well.

The game is also missing some content, which is to be expected from early access. Many icons are placeholders, there are only two mission types, some landmarks do not have mapmarkers or their mapmarkers aren't revealed by walking up to them. There is a lack of passive and neutral mobs, and the ecosystem in general feels less diverse that other similar titles (*sigh* ARK), we know there are plenty of other mobs in the works, this is just critique at the time of writing. 

In summary, this game is what early access should be: a playable yet unfinished game, giving the community an opportunity to help squash bugs (pun intended) in exchange for a reduced price tag and the assumption of some risk should the project go under. Well done Obsidian, I look forward to this games future.

- not being able to open box even when no one's opening it
-  when items more than 1 stack are put in the smoothie, it will ""disappear"" until you put it back into your inventory
- There are no ""sort item"" options in inventory and chest
- You cannot remove 1 item only from a stack of the same item, you have to remove the entire stack
-When you join a game, the weapons hotbar are sometimes missing the weapons and some items stack another item over (it does not remove the item, you can see your missing items by putting the items in a different hotbar)
- Ants are able to take items from boxes that are 10 cm above them
- Some items/ enemies does not/rarely spawn, like acorns (does not spawn back) or gnats (in 5 hours, i've never seen it once)

[list]
[*]Animation, Artwork are well done (The excitement currently shown)
[*]New idea and really fun at first (Honey I Shrunk the Kids style. More ART excitement)
[*]Nice sounds and immersive in its execution (Again ART department did its job)
[*]Crafting is Fun but troublesome
[*]Base Building is Fun but troublesome and fails
[*]All sorts of insects and research but some do nothing
[*]Fresh idea on survival, artwork is all I can be excited about in this ""Honey I Shrunk the Kids"" style game which is what the kids are going bonkers about.

The bad and ugly -- Honest as of 7th of August 2020
[*]Items randomly disappear in containers, very common
[*]Developers claim to listen to community, still do nothing to fix what community shared in over a month. SEE BELOW**
[*]Sent out free codes to get terrific reviews and the terrific artwork is what gets the kids so hyped in support currently. 
[*]Base auto connecting of parts is nice, but annoying. No freedom when building on rough terrain, and bugs/ants will crawl over or under or thru anything. Even spawn inside.
[*]Bugs spawn anywhere, there is no safe area, you are dead.
[*]Easiest setting, Killed 41 of 45 times by spiders even during the day
UPDATE: Today in patch note, they tweaked aggro and distance of aggro.
[*] BAD BAD warning sign on development.. SEE BELOW***
[*]Spiders Spawn in your base, welcome home lunch.
[*]Content ended game after 4.9 hours with window of we are making more stuff
[*]Collision with environment and getting stuck on environment is HORRIBLE!
[b]
NOT WORTH $30.00, NOT EVEN CLOSE!
Parents wait for 25% or more sale. Finished all content in just over 4 hours.
Industry standards it falls below by an absurd $6.00 per hour.
Industry standards currently run $1.75 - $1.80 per hour of game play.

We would have said YES to this game, based on finished product mapping and projected plan. But more reasons to say NO based on their recent updates of insignificant worth.

Three things can happen when something is WAY WAY WAY overpriced as this title;
[/b]
[*]Corporate [insert adjective here] that govern the developers, pricing, and in most cases are clueless, which eventually will ruin development and completion.
[*]Greed of developers if a small team, that finally get money in their pocket, and they may abandon project until the money runs out.
[*]Lastly, the game may get finished but who knows

Gamble if you wanna. 
[b]
** A child will NEVER care about some bugs such as items vanishing, bad base building, getting stuck on environment, or threats spawning anywhere. 
** It will give any child between ages 7-13 hours of babysitting time. Cheaper to pay for a babysitter.

***When tweaking only occurs in development of an EA game, it is low level developers in MOST cases, only tweaking a shell of the finished game, with no more depth development going on to fix major issues, when only adjustments are made and working only on multiplayer connection issues.

If you want to play with the time you invest in them actually makes you feel happy, DO NOT GET THIS until we see if they actually develop the game or just artwork the game shell more and tweak more surface values.

Overtime the game will be updated with new content and bug fixes so it's not so short/boring anymore. I personally had a lot of fun playing with friends trying to hunt down spiders, only to end up screaming for our lives. The cartoonish style of this game is really nice and I love the scaling of everything. You really do feel small when you realize you're about the size of an ant, with every blade of grass towering over you. The building system is a pretty cool concept that I like. When it comes to transporting grass planks or weed stems, you have to actually hull it in your hands in small stacks. Then if something threatens you, just go ahead and panic throw all those supplies into the poor soul that ran into you.

The whole recipe researching system doesn't work for stupid gaymers like me. I can't tell you how long it took for us to research a grass plank or a weed stem. It's not the game's fault for us being stupid. It pretty much tells you to research stuff right at the beginning. It seems like food and especially clean water are really hard to come by in the world. Yes you could kill stuff for meat but that goes bad in a day. Also you could make jerky out of them so they don't expire, expect then you'll need to drink more water. Pretty much I just grab a bunch of mushrooms and drink dirty water. When the hunger goes down I just keep eating until my belly explodes from the dirty water and probably dangerous shrooms.

Currently I can't exactly recommend this game to someone in this state of development, due to the game not having much to offer at this moment, but I'm looking forward to what Obsidian have planned in the future.

I like most of the game play, the building and crafting is fun, and there is huge potential for the story line moving forward. What I don't like is the fighting system specially against all of the harder enemies. The difficulty reminds me of Dark Souls which is a game that I dislike purely because of those same mechanics. I play most survival games on easy because I don't play games for the challenge. I play games to have fun and relax. I was hoping that with this game looking like it was going to be geared more towards kids that it would be easier on Mild mode than it has turned out to be. I don't want a Passive mode, but, it looks like I might have to beg for one if the developers leave the fighting the way it is.

If you like playing survival games that are more challenging like The Forest in normal mode then you will most likely like this game.

30,74044604,english,"!!!STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME!!! (for now)
I'm not the type of person to normally leave a review, infact i don't believe i ever have done in the past, however;
I spent the last 9 hours playing this game and its currently 5am in the morning, i was having a relatively good time and everything was going well up until an un expected crash occurred, then when i reload the world my loot and gear is no longer on my character and theres no visible backpack anywhere to be found on the map. Everything was just gone.
Simply put, the crash somehow erased almost all of the progress i had made in the last 9 hours.

Because of this and a handful of other reasons, i simply cannot recommend this game to anybody right now, Save your money and save your time. The game is in an extremely buggy state and you will enjoy it more if you put it off until the issues are fixed and the story is expanded. 

Creatures hitboxes connect when theyre nowhere near you, creatures glitch through walls and terrain, creatures gett stuck under the map for you to then be forced to listen to their sounds over and over, weapons and arrows gett stuck under the map and are unable to be retrieved, my friends couldn't hit any of the blue berries after they had fallen, only the host could do anything with them. The spiders seem to almost always find a way to glitch out and just stand there staring at you while you beat it to death, the sap collectors don't work at all and you cannot even place them most the time, there isn't a reliable way to keep on top of your thirst meter so you are constantly forced to suicide or drink dirty water. The building is glitchy at best and sometimes things just will not place for no reason and if you do manage to place them its never in the right spot because the blueprint keeps jumping around, jumping up against a blade of grass (which is literally everywhere by the way) will launch you backwards into the air enough to take fall damage, acorns are a valuable resource in the game however, now that we have collected all the acorns refuse to respawn even though it says they should every night. Not to mention in the current state the story only lasts 5 minutes.

just save your money and frustration on this one by adding it to your wish list and forgetting about it for awhile. It's a decent game and the concept is there, the execution is just not perfected right now.

According to my calculations, if I use 100% of the mining pools resources, I may be able to run Grounded on min resolution and low graphics setting at 30 fps.

There's also a stupid requirement to have an Xbox Account (Idk if they require you to purchase gold because I already have it and therefore was not prompted to purchase it) to play multiplayer (which doesn't work yet) which makes 0 sense considering I purchased this game on Steam.

This game is the biggest cash grab/SCAM since Ouya, no reason why a game this unfinished and this poorly made should be work $30 just for you to be work as an unpaid beta tester. They say that they really appreciate feedback, but I refuse to give them any since this game should be FREE until it has a half finished beta at bare minimum, even Activi$ion releases free beta's of their games.

And before any of you Early Access Aristocrats come at me with ""Yeah but this is an Early Access game bro."" Okay, but why is this worth 30 Dollars American? Did I wake up in an alternate Reality where Microsoft and Obsidian are indie companies, and can only afford to keep themselves afloat by selling garbage beta versions for full price? 
Jesus Christ, even Minecraft had a working beta version, and the guy who made that was a neckbeard working on his own with nothing but a trenchcoat on his back and a fedora on his head.

This game is truly pathetic, and Microsoft should be ashamed of their blatant attempt to not only outsource the beta testing to us, but also the fund raising.

Now the save data after you slept will cause the game to crash as soon as you load it up! Which sucks. I usually don't get into survival sandboxes because their all the same too me. Unless its trying to put an interesting spin on it like Subnautica or even this. As of now its too buggy for me but it is still in early access right now so its still has room to grow.

This and many other hidden secrets i wont say make exploring a lot of fun for me with what is there now and what i see is yet to come? im very excited to find more secrets and learn more about the story in this game.

Graphics are wonderful, game play is both easy and challenging, crafting system feels like its just the right mix other then materials to use when you repair some low tier tools, you can repair yourspear or bow with some plant fiber as an example but your stone axe?! requires quartzite which seems a bit silly, all your higher lvl tools and weapons require this for repairs which is fair in my mind. some tweaks and balancing would be nice in that aspect.

i give this game a 4 out of 5 rating personally and would have been a 5/5 but only because the story was not worked on more before its release is why i dont give it a maximum rating, following the main quest line you literally hit the end in about 10 minutes.

As of build 0.1.1 The game has a long way to go. This is by no means a finished game. In fact, far from it. There are still many, many bugs in the code. You will often get stuck inside things. (walls, floors) There  are major items for the quest that do now spawn. (ex ant eggs) No clear way to toggle markers. (ex. you can click the map, and they may or may not turn on) Poor AI paths. (AI will get stuck on/in things like walls and floors) No clear map bounds. (ex. they have a large section that says under construction) Tool limits. (ex. some things you can cut, some you can't)

All that being said, the game is playable. You get the feel for the basics. I don't know how I feel for paying for a beta. I hate this is the way games are going. Almost none of the games you buy anymore are finished. If people don't play it, than you bought a beta, if people do than they will keep working on it.

58,74034709,english,"Quick Intro:

Might be boring in Singleplayer but definetly fun in Multiplayer --> AT THIS POINT.

Most outstanding is the atmosphere and of course the idea about the game!
It is not just another survival game instead it is something new.

Of course as an early accsess title there are some lacks:
Missing story! At this time there is a 5 minute story. But im curious about the rest.
Some minor bugs. I did not have any issues or lacks of perfomance.

Some ppl are complaining alot about the missing story. In my opinion you can play with your friends explore the crafting and the good base building. or you can go suicide by killing a spider on your own.

In my opinion i recommend the game! Even though the price might be a bit high atm. Especially for an EA title at this early stage.

SO BUY IT :D (nope im not sponsore....yet :D )

Needless to say, for an early access game, it has a lot of wow moments and fun situation. especially since co op is available early on, and that's the only reason we've bought this game.

Graphics and ambiance is enchanting, The garden is very big and jungle like, I like how it doesn't go slow on the vegetation and rocks/boulders. it truly makes the experience of you being small more immersive, rather than just thrown into some weird world. 

The gameplay is straightforward but also intuitive, we've like the ""analyze"" part where you are pushed to bring that materials to get more blueprint, rather than a scroll based blueprint. 

As the state of this game now, i believe we're going to see many future updates that will be amazing, and couldn't wait to play them.

which if a good score for a game so early in developement, and rating any hire would just show a lack of ability to accurately determine a game's current quality. 
If anyone ever gives a game a 10/10 ignore their reviews because 10/10 means it's a perfect game with no flaws or downsides.
And yes, we ""ALL"" know the game is ""early access"", but that's no excuse to behave like children with this behavior of ""you can't ever say anything bad about a game"" mentality people seems to have. 
it's call ""constructive criticism""
also Steam has such a lazily designed Review system which appears as just a ""love or hate"" option. if Steam wanted accurate review scores they'd do a 1-10 rating,
so if someone doesn't recommend the game now, the ""thumbs down"" to the ignorant children of the internet looks like a ""YOU HATE THE GAME!!!"" to which i say, Grow Up. enough of the childish, straight from 0 to 100, either with us or against us behavior. 
 
the game looks great, has an interesting approach to survival games, and unlike other survival games, it really offers the ability to change the player's perspective on the world, things like ""there's a whole world like this in my own back yard"" 
But when you're actually playing there isn't much to the survival aspect. (lack of food items and base building)

visually the game is quite an achievement, but there is a large lack tools, resources, and buildables in the game's current state. plus few to NO options to protect your base from raiding bugs which can just spawn inside your base at times (anyehere from 10-30) and kill you repeatedly, then proceed to destroy the majority of your structures, causing you to have to basically start over again. 
- ants seem to be attracted to food stored in chests, meaning you can't store food AT ALL.
- Spiders seems to be attracted to raw meat, either stored away or left on your person,
- not sure what attracts the larva swarms, heard someone say corpses, but there are none, unless it's insect parts, again meaning you can't store those either if that's true. (basically can't store anything other than rocks and fibers)
all of the above which bee-line from across the map to destroy your base, or just spawn in waves inside your base that you can't defend.
only 1 farming item, a mushroom garden, a lack of building options, and bugs that you can't really defend well against without cheesing the AI.

Now overall it's a great experience that shows a lot of potential. I'm excited to see what farming options they open up, either new plants, resources, or bug farms, bug mounts/pets, new building options, utilities, furnitures, everything.

in it's current state i could only recommend it to people who are very patient with the game's development (sounds like they'll be updating once a month)
but in general, and from an unbiased and critical review standpoint, i wouldn't recommend the game in it's current state as there are a lot of things that need fixing and to be more thought out, so as not to have incidents that ruin players fun with the game, 
again like the constant random bug hordes spawning INSIDE bases, not allowing players the time to learn what or even fix what's causing the issue and you have to sit there and watch your hours of work are destroyed, which is no fun for anyone, as it feels it's punishing you for even playing more than it is teaching you anything. 

still can't recommend it in it's current state since after the players beat the current 15-30 minute story, they will end up exploring around the world and going to areas that the future story will take them and their experience will have been ruined since they'll have already explored and found the secrets months before the story takes them there, meaning there will be little room for ""new"" experiences and surprises alongside the new story additions.
in the long run this will hurt the game since 
it'll be like recieveing end game Spoilers before getting half way through the game.

That is, it's a huge ""meh"" in it's current early access state.

I adore the concept and what I assume it's aiming for, it just seems after 1 and a half hours I had seen and done everything it has to offer; hence the ""not recommended"" (in it's current early access state).

Honey I Shrunk the Kids: The Game™ 

I usually play games through a 3rd-party site before purchasing, through Steam or otherwise- especially those in Early Access because of harsh criticism. 'Money worth your time invested in the game' blah blah. ""Grounded"" made the list of purchasing in a few hours of playing for many of reasons. As a HUGE fan of survival games, this one made the cut.

Pros

- 9/10 Graphics/Atmosphere – Polished, stylized and overall a joy to look at. Playing on High default settings with a low-end computer setup, it's absolutely beautiful. Lighting, reflections, size scale – day or night – it sinks you into being Ant Man sized. Sound effects and music are fantastic!!

- 8/10 Performance – Through 3rd-party or via Steam, there's been little to no lag hiccups or shuddering. Keep in mind I've played single player only. Only obvious issues of enemies/items clipping through the floor but what game doesn't have those issues?

- 8/10 Combat – Smooth, the sound effects and animations give weight to every blow. Repair system decently balanced along with being punished for not blocking when enemy attacks are choreographed. Overpowered spiders well deserved

- 6/10 Characters – Each teen has a different personality and responds to actions accordingly. I know through watching multiplayer there's interactions between them too. Right off the bat, I enjoy how each has responded to the world they've been sent to. The biggest drawback is not having character specific abilities or stats. Maybe Maxwell having having higher health and Hoops a bigger stamina bar. Perhaps Pete a larger inventory or Willow raised attack. My personal nick-pick side. When playing a game, I wish to be invested in the characters and how their variance in stats can effect the game-play.

BUT. The voice-acting is top notch. And BURG.L is adorable (extra points because I work in a restaurant haha). Most potential rests here for me


- 4/10 Content – The biggest downside. The story is left extremely weak. While curious for what's next, wish there was a LITTLE (hah, small joke) bit more to keep players hooked in for an Early Access. Crafting items have been serviceable, same goes for base building and exportation of the ok sized map. If off the beaten trail of quests and go out, there's some unique bugs to try and beat besides 'OMG NO PLEASE DON'T SPIDERS.' Nothing awesome but nothing to write home about


Overall

For an Early Access game, its clean controls, gorgeous visuals, fun and heart pumping game-play (if spiders scare the sh*t outta you) make it a pleasurable experience. If you're into survival games, I recommend picking this up. A bonus, in this case, is being Early Access. More and more content will trickle into this game as does water droplets into an acorn water container. I'm looking forwarded to each update.

Small storage containers sometimes will lock you out. Big ones don't lock out but they sometimes leak items for some reason.

25,74009225,english,"Early Access means that the ""Plot"" only advances to the first major plot point and then stalls, leaving you with nothing to do but explore, build your base, and work your way up the tech tree.

But I haven't enjoyed exploration this much since Subnautica. The ""Shrunken kids in a suburban back yard"" proves to be an awesome setting to get lost in. The towering jungles of grass, soda cans you can build a house in, and going Skyrim-style cave diving in anthills.

I don't think a game's enemies have freaked me out as much since Subnautica, either. I don't consider myself to have a fear of spiders, but hearing a skuttling behind you, and turning around to find a two-story tall wolf spider racing at you inflicts a terror I haven't felt since my first Leviathan. Fortunately, there's an option to turn the spiders into something else, because I can't imagine how an arachnophobe would react to getting ganged up on by three orb-weavers while trying to make their way through the rose-garden edging.

The base building is a pain: All of it requires massive planks of grass that your kid can only carry five at a time, meaning you're in for dozens of trips back and forth to get any decent structure constructed. But the 'Grass strapped together with moss strands and twinks' style is excellent. The armor sets you wind up constructing out of clover leaves, acorn shells, and spider bits are weird, but exactly the sort of thing you'd expect half-inch-high kids to pull together.

It might all fall apart when the rest of the storyline's implimented. Ants might be recoded to be able to climb up your walls and chew through your bedroom window and eat all your stuff. They might start spawning spiders out of thin air. They might put fish in the middle of the pond just to make the Subnautica flashbacks complete. But until any of that happens, I highly recommend this game to anyone who likes the Build To Survive genre.",1596946918,1596946918,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True,76561198018234709,868,10,3240,249,609,1601621320

28,74008183,english,"It hurts my heart to negatively review a game from THE Obsidian Entertainment, but this EA product misses the mark.

It's gorgeous, the music is on point, and they clearly put a lot of effort into the aesthetics.

But the gameplay, tutorial content and pacing need a lot of work (insofar as the pacing is concerned, just adding some would be a good start).  Before I have a second to just take in the aesthetic, this small world made larger, I'm rushing to avoid starving, dehydrating, sent on one badly-explained fools errand of a quest after the next -- and since the tutorial doesn't include anything about the game's internal logic, I have things constantly beeping and booping without any idea why they are. 

Tip: Reel us in early. Have your characters spend a little more time reacting to the world-made-larger, instead of throwaway line after throwaway line of snark, glib commentary and so on. The stitching on the baseball, the us-sized ants fighting weevils. This instead of pulling us in two different directions while we're also trying to just take in the world you created. Experienced players will have time to do that when they're stabilized, but the moment will have been lost by then. 

A shame. I hope it improves. Still love you, Obsidian.

At 11 hours in on 3 different files, my own, and 2 others with different friends, the game already has a solid amount of content. Despite having no perks or any sort of leveling the tier of weapons plays a big part in still making for feel progression, starting with spears and axes and using the parts of beaten bugs to upgrade and advance. Each armor has different advantages and disadvantages so even some of the earlier armors have some use here and there. A small but diverse 11 bugs currently reside in the game, from the tiny aphids to the monsterous spiders each having a use and purpose in the game either for food or progression. The tool selection is small at the moment with only 3 hammers, 2 axe, 1 spear, and 2 clubs but I can see that being super easy to expand as the yard gets bigger and more dangerous with the new bugs.

33,74008218,english,"I'm going to be as honest as possible, while trying to remain polite and constructive. I am fully aware that this game is in early access, so take everything I have to say with a grain of salt.

Firstly, the atmosphere is wonderful. You're tiny, and facing tiny problems. The tiny visuals are a joy, if only you were able to fully appreciate the scale of the things in your yard. Up to this point, the devs have decided that blurring all ""huge"" things (such as the tree and the house) is a good idea, but all this does is makes it a visual EYE SORE. I feel like I have both put on and removed my glasses, giving me nothing but simulated eyestrain. I WISH I could experience how truly big these things are in comparison to me, but again, they are out of focus and nearly impossible to appreciate. (Just think about it, it's like a normal person looking at a skyscraper and it's just one big blur. Doesn't make sense and hurts the eyes)

Secondly, I feel like there isn't much to do that I haven't done already in nearly every other survival game. While the perspective is different, the feel of the game is all too familiar. I would love to see them change the game right from the beginning. Maybe give you a pet bug from the get go, something to take care of while you figure out what is happening. The experience of being alone in the wild and punching items until you get more useful ones has been done too much.

I have few comments on other aspects including locomotion, which has been executed quite nicely. Everything feels fluid, and rarely did I find geometry hindering my exploration. The UI is easy to understand, and I never felt like I was being walked through a large tutorial.

Unfortunately, I haven't bothered with multiplayer. I already didn't enjoy the game on my own from a technical point of view. Unless the game is tweaked to be more unique, I may not see myself playing much more of this game.

there is a lot of good stuff going for this game but at this early stage of development there isnt much to do.

things that need done before i can give good review...
   *when armor and items are equiped they are still in your backpack, when you finally have all the tools you need, you loose half you storage space.
   *enemy ai has anti cheese mechanics that mess up fair play, when creature looses agro they regain all health, a few times now iv been in a fight and jumped somewhere the bug cant fallow and it immediately regains all its health. i understand wanting to make enemy's that you cant exploit but when the system messes up fair play its gotta go or be fixed.
   *items in inventory  dont auto stack and a lot of quality of life inventory mechanics that are standard in games is missing, make you spent to much time sorting inventory between box's.
   *food goes bad in less then 1 day in game...

those are my major gripes and most of then are easy fix's.

66,74000340,english,"While this game is less than two weeks off of its release as early access at the time of this review, there is a lot of substance to it. Obsidian is already accepting lots of feedback for this new title, and they will likely channel such feedback into improvements for an already outstanding outdoor adventure. Here are my personal thoughts on the game so far:

[b] Graphics [/b]: The game looks amazing. There is loads of detail packed into every inch of the backyard that you explore. It is apparent that the game was meant to feel immersive and look fairly realistic. Unfortunately, that means that you'll need a beefy computer to play Grounded at an optimal graphics level. If you do have an advanced computer rig, then you have access to an array of the visual embellishments the game has to look more realistic, including motion blur and shading (gamma). Even if you don't, the game looks good but a bit blurry at the lowest settings. The one complaint I will share about the game's art is the sprite work, both in the inventory and as models in the world. Some of the sprites work well, but many are unpolished, reused, or simply not done. This especially goes for 3D models in the world, with many item just being brown bags. 

[b] Game Play [/b]: This game is optimized for Xbox, which is apparent with Xbox on the loading screen. Luckily, the keyboard controls have been properly examined and concentrated to the left side of the keyboard around WASD movement. Any buttons that are out of the way, like M for the map, are shortcuts to menus that are already accessible from multiple places. I'm also confident that the keyboard bindings can be edited to personalize the controls and eliminate uncomfortable game play.

As far as the game itself, it is fairly intuitive if you are a survival game veteran, but maybe a bit abstruse for new arrivals to the genre. I think the game could use a little more direction from the start. To do that, the only change I would recommend is for an additional starting quest to craft an axe. That way, players will become familiar with the crafting interface right away and how to navigate through multiple tabs. It will also make the build a lean-to quest much more natural after.

[b] Multiplayer [/b]: Because Xbox is supposed to be the primary platform for this game and not Steam, multiplayer uses Xbox Live in order to connect with other players. This indicates cross-platform compatibility, but also means that Steam users need an Xbox Live subscription to play multiplayer. This is the part that I disagree with. I like the idea of cross-platform compatibility, but I think that purchasing a subscription to a completely different console in order to play online with other computer users should be optional, as well as viewing the message before the main menu screen reminding me of logging in with Xbox Live. That should only be after selecting multiplayer. It should only be mandated if we Steam users want to play with Xbox players online. As with pretty much all other games, multiplayer has its own unique array of bugs, but because I have not played or seen multiplayer, I consider myself inadequate to further comment on bugs in multiplayer.

[b] Bugs (as in the ones with legs) [/b]: [spoiler] The game features a host of legged creatures, with four harmless ones, half a dozen or more moderate threats, and five titans of the lawn that are not easily trifled with. The current ones fit very well in my opinion, but there is still room for more. Personally, I would like to see more flying creatures, namely bees, hornets, crickets, and dragonflies. With that, I would like to see improved aerial combat. The one flying creature (gnat) is difficult to hit even when circling the player. Throwable nets or web traps would be fun to see to fight winged creatures. Also improved gliders and more use for grub armor would compliment such additions. [/spoiler]

Raw Science: [spoiler] This game has a currency system known as Raw Science. You exchange it for recipes from BURG.L. However, the game fails to indicate in any fashion that you need to pick up the small, almost unnoticable item by BURG.L's feet and give it to him before you can exchange Raw Science for anything. Otherwise, this currency has no application. BURG.L (in his exchange tab) or the game should tell you to look around the room before exchanging Raw Science for anything so the currency and side quests have use. [/spoiler]

Building: [spoiler] This game has building features that involve cutting down larger plants and fashioning them into house parts. The game does not tell you that you need clay and access to BURG.L for more intricate house building. The houses are much simpler without these. Windowed walls are, to me, the most infuriating part of house building. They are differently sized than walls and are pickier regarding placement. I think that maybe a movement to find and gather clay at some point would make building a bit better, as well as re-examining windowed walls. [/spoiler]

SCA.B: [spoiler] SCA.B (pronounced ""scabby"") is the device attached to the player's arm that monitors their overall health. It is the in-game explanation as to why the character can visibly see how hungry or thirsty they are. SCA.B is very obnoxious in practice. The UI for the stat interface is fine, but the noises that SCA.B makes (a mechanical [i] waaah waaaaaaaaah [/i]) to alert the player are relentlessly irritating. There should be an option to change the noise SCA.B makes (maybe a purchasable from BURG.L) and/or a volume setting on it. [/spoiler]

[b] Story [/b]: The story of this game is in the works. You can get the main quests done in just about an hour or two depending on how brave you're feeling. [spoiler] After you activate the machine and go to the lab, there's not much except side quests to run errands. [/spoiler] The story is probably the part of this game that is the most heavily in development or just the least implemented right now.

[b] Conclusion [/b]: If you are interested in survival games, this one makes for a really good option, even in an unfinished state. It is a unique take on a survival game, with many potential avenues to explore. Later down the road, I might follow this up once the game gets more content and fixes.",1596931366,1596931366,True,0,0,0.479203879833221436,0,True,False,True,76561198205072543,32,2,1781,0,1584,1597096189

What a beautiful game.  The amount of potential this game has is staggering.  I'm just imagining late game being in the pond with a makeshift boat or some sort of diving makeshift suit of some sort to get into a a new biom under water or an island.  Or perhaps, make our way into the house and holy cow the POTENTIAL.  Daddy Long Legs SUPER HUGE crawling all over the place.  I mean, CMON developers this has such a massive chip on its shoulder and I am hungry, just waiting on the dip.

Ok enough with the foreplay.

Atmosphere: 5/5

Really nothing to say about this.  I felt able to go anywhere I wanted in the entire layout of the game so far, no hindrances aside from stuff I assume will be implemented as time goes by.  Done and done.

Story: 2/5

It's still early.  I imagine quite a lot of Subnauticaesque style of quests being implemented along with more quest hubs.  Giving a 2 as of now for that alone, however the quests that are provided give us a pretty good traveling picture book journey across the built landscape.

Graphics: 5/5

Absolutely beautiful.  Atmosphere should have already covered this, but those sounds mmm  mm.  Bravo!

Sound: 4/5

Because why not.  Sound is very, VERY important in my opinion of course.  I will only point to Subnautica in cases like this, simply because of the sound design.  Again game, is super early stages here but so far it is well done.

Crafting: 3/5

Very easy to understand crafting in this game.  Not too much diversity.  Would love for more items, again, still early stages.  But none the less a 3 a 3 a 3 for you sir.

Character: 2/5

Now.  A 2 here, really only shows the minimal amount of detail we have with our characters.  I would like to see each character having certain specialist titles.  One's more sciency and therefor has different craftible options.  Ones super athletic and can run jump climb faster, and on and on.  The little interactions we do have however are on point.  Certain landmarks you discover and the little character quirks are a very good start.

Overall: 3/5

Definitely well worth the money in the games current stage.

80,73995757,english,"cant fully commit a review to this game. It really has its ups/downs due to it being early access game. 
dont know if this just applies to me but for the bugs/glitches:
1. falling tree physics. dont know if game dev did it on purpose but sometimes after cutting down trees, they would be launched away like on a catapult flying off to ridiculous locations - pain to have it be hauled.
2. fallen item physics, there will be times when the ground is littered with your mats (plant fiber, grass, stems ,etc) when you walk/run over them, you trip/stumble/bounce preventing movement temporarily. 
3. when organizing my inventory via storage chests, my items being deposited would disappear completely and my total backpack space would get reduced.. couldnt fix until i restarted game.
4. still rather new to the game so this might be just me being dumb.. but when knocking back an arrow with bow equipped, cant disable animation to cancel shooting the bow..
5. latency issues but this might just be my local internet connections. 

besides those points, the game is fantastic and heavy with content. gives you puzzles to solve, hunt/gather, research, build, craft. endless possibilities! cant wait for more multiplayer functions in the future.",1596923201,1596923201,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True,76561198026122856,13,1,807,0,506,1597006743

The combat is kind of bland, and the deeper systems of gear mechanics are interesting - I hope to see it fleshed out more with gadgets or something more beyond the 3 pieces of gear you can equip right now.  It's fun for what it is, but I don't think I'll be playing it any more for the following reason:

Unlike games like Subnautica where you mine for ore and non-living materials to create stuff for progression, in Grounded you have to kill bugs. At first I didn't think I would mind that very much, but over time I found the Aphids to be cute, and the Ants to be pretty fun to chill out with. Sadly you gotta kill 'em to build better armor and weapons. Ladybugs are adorable, but you gotta kill 'em if you want better weapons. None of those things ever attack you or are aggressive towards you - they just mind their own business. The ants will even walk up to you, be chill and emote a bit, then wander off - you can even feed them.

Love the building mechanism here. similar to ""The Forest"". Room for improvement. Cant wait for more updates. I normally dont play survival games for really long hours a day, they tend to get to me and bore me to death. This one took a whole day off me. I couldnt put it down. I'm looking forward to a better farming mechanism. Like live stock with tiny bugs as chickens and bigger ones as cows. Maybe Mounts to ride and haul bigger materials to areas u cant find the right stuff to build. I would flip out with a Bee and Hornet Mounts to scout n just fly around! 
And just like others have mentioned. Unaware human and animal interactions. Like a random toy falling out of the sky and crunching a area of the map, maybe you loose your whole base cuz someone stepped on it. Dogs and Birds try to eat ya.

Great theme and concept, a mixture of PIXAR-esque style with a hint of ""Honey I shrunk the kids"" kind of vibe.

Honestly as interesting as the story was/is my group and I were more so focused on the survival aspect and looking to quickly grind to get the best gear to conquer the garden.

Shortly after a few days of the same thing we kinda started to slow down and eventually started to lose a little interest. The trope gets boring quickly without the content but I am sure more content is coming / going to be added later. A little bit of server issues as sometimes my friends or I would randomly get disconnected, a good bunch of bugs but the dev team seem to be keeping up so that's all well and good.

So long as the updates keep coming and content is being added then this game will net you days and days of fun! BONUS if you have friends to play with but even alone you can really get immersed in the world.

For the moment since its still new I'll give it a 6.5/10.

ABSOLUTELY YES! Reccomend every time! Great in Solo, Great in Multiplayer

Is the game finished, no, but that is literally what you sign up for when buying early access. If you don't want in now, wishlist it, don't sleep on this one.

My only critique is the UIX is a bit awkward as is.. hope this gets a lil more streamlined but not game changing for me.
Even in its current state I would easily reccomend this game (presuming its further development -- which I don't doubt).

Sure some bugs (not trying to understate; any bugs I encountered did not drastically alter my experience)

The limitless potential here...I am giddy with anticipation for the future of this game!
(I have already imagined DLC possibilities beyond the initial campaign, I hope this game becomes an expanding series the way of Toy Story)

I've played for 5 hours and mostly have been worrying about consuming liquid. This makes it difficult to stay hydrated when playing coop. 
Also, water drops don't disappear at times, creating a HUGE delicious water/juice drop, but it is entirely inaccessible because it's a glitch and not actually there.

The atmosphere and gameplay loop are fun and addicting and any game that lets me kill monsters and make armor from their corpses will get my vote.  However there are a few major issues that make this game hard to play and enjoy.  The inventory issues being the primary offender.  For basically the whole game most of my inventory was tools and armor.  I had maybe 8-10 slots at a time for loot which meant lots pf running home.  I spent more time running back home than I feel I spent doing anything else.  Combat seems to be a heavy focus of the game and while fun actually fighting things makes the game harder.  I spent hours hunting ladybugs for the armor only for it to break after maybe 30 minutes.  (you can repair, but that gets expensive).  The game puts a lot of value on ""perfect blocking"" and the issue with that is that the block doesn't stop your armor from being destroyed.  I fought one wolf spider and took no damage, but it almost completely destroyed my armor in that one fight.   Plus it took a long time for me to figure out how to fight the enemies because the hit boxes are so broken.  I've died dozens of times to Bombardiers and Spiders that according to the animations never hit me.

68,73963765,english,"This game is early access as of writing this and so obviously, things are expected to change.

Grounded is a game in which you take the form of a shrunken human trying to survive in the...backyard. I personally think the style is adorable, and I think, though opposite, it is a welcome surprise when paired with the combat of the game.

I'll start with the good. The game is beautiful. The lighting is fantastic, and you can't really get away with cheating too much in the dark by boosting the gamma. Problem solving to get food or water is actually very fun and rewarding, and I don't feel rushed to top these bars every few minutes, which is a welcome change from other survival games in which I have to eat or drink frequently - it gives me time to explore, or complete tasks given to me. The game also makes it very clear when you're low on something. The varying insects all have different mechanics, which, even without a tutorial is pretty quick to grasp, for example, some bugs are never hostile (though annoying - gnats), some aren't until attacked, you can get away with sneaking behind some, while others - not so much. Some have routes, which you can pick up on, and others leave their ""designated"" areas. Progress in terms of getting upgrades also feels rewarding, and though it's not fully released, I have a feeling that the lore will be... interesting, to say the least, based on the potential ""easter eggs"" throughout the map (unless it turns out to be the whole ""but it was all a dream!"" shtick). Overall, the progression feels rewarding. There's always multiple ways to get to destinations, even if you choose not to go the ""intended"" way. I quite enjoyed the base-building, as well - it was relaxing rather than tedious. Also, through my research, the game is supposed to be ""reactive"", meaning that the resources and actions you take have an effect on the way the ""ecosystem"" changes, though, I have seen very little of this.
Also, multiplayer is functional, both through steam, and cross-platform (though tedious, but that'll be touched on later). The amount of breath you have while swimming is another pleasant addition to the game, since you can stay underwater for more than two seconds.  The map is fun and, though unneeded in my case, the arachnophobia mode is pretty funny, but useful to some. Jump height, maneuverability, resource gathering - all wonderful. 

For the bad (and again, PLEASE remember, this is early access). Bugs. BUGS! No pun, but game-breaking bugs are very prevalent at the time of reviewing this game, to name a few that I've personally encountered: Crashing, inventory deletion (constantly), forced ""/kill"" - ""Give Up"" via getting permanently grappled by non-existent spider webs, smacked through walls, aggro'd on through walls, and getting launched like team rocket any time I jump into any kind of angled structure. Resources and insects getting sucked into impenetrable structures. The hitboxes for hostiles is a bit ridiculous (I can't tell you how many times I was rocketed to the underworld by a spider standing a good 200 feet away from me). The game has essentially zero replayability, and the map is constant - never-changing. At a low difficulty setting, and full ladybug armour, wolf spiders can still two-hit the players. There are tasks in the game which are completely impossible to complete, as what's needed has not yet been implemented into the game. The game is quite clearly not optimized to play on PC yet, basic tasks like dropping items, or stashing stacks are tedious and take extra time for nothing - and the ""esc/escape"" button is 50/50 with if it decides it wants to work, especially when looking around in the menu, settings, what have you. Though understandable for cross-platform, getting multiplayer to function is a bit annoying, needing an alternative to my steam account (microsoft) set up to play ANY multiplayer, even if it isn't being played crossplatform. Finally, the voices and voicelines of the kids are atrocious. This is purely my opinion, but Willow Branch (seriously why did you do this to me) is the only character worth playing, as she complains the least in her voice lines and isn't literally moaning when she eats. The jokes (ex: ""this tastes worse/better than my mom/dad's brussel sprouts"" - feat. What is this an 80's Sitcom?) If you're not interested in the story, I highly recommend just turning off the voices and subtitles, while you're at it. Though the least of the issues, the voices and, (but mostly) script for purely the children is the most annoying to me.

In conclusion, I do NOT recommend this game currently, primarily because it's not optimized to be played with anything but a controller, and until that makes stashing all of your inventory before closing the game easier, or until the vanishing inventory bug is patched, I can't in good spirits tell people to purchase this game. I could tolerate everything else.

IF you are careful, don't mind the slight wonkynes due to bugs, are patient with the time it takes to perform basic actions, I think you can play the game confidently without many issues, even with friends. I think with a few tweaks, and with more progression, the game will be great, and I'll be - hopefully - returning to update this review in the future.",1596876863,1596877600,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,True,76561198070243659,69,12,918,0,791,1596952059

First of all I will say this: I am [b]Terrified[/b] of spiders, I get very stressed out playing this game. The safe mode for this game does not make things any better in my opinion. 

~ The game has a lot to do depending on how you play it.  The farther out you go you'll realize that there's not much out there, but that's when the exploration part comes in. There's lots of areas to explore and you can go out of bounds to see future content. If you decide to stay in bounds the game provides a great amount to do, and for a small game there's a lot of lore that's already placed in. 

~ There's currently single-player, co-op and a creative mode. The single-player and co-op has a choice of three different difficulties, depending on which you play will decide how fast the hunger and thirst bar will drain, and how much damage the insects will deal. 

~ The game has a tier list and as you move through the tiers, you'll realize that it becomes more difficult to play. So far there's [spoiler]3[/spoiler] tiers. This tier list works for the base building and the weapon layout. The further you go, the better the base to build and the more powerful weapons to be built.

notes for devs : Make adventuring more rewarding pls, like I went down to a cave underwater, then went into some other caves to find nothing but a full animal bone and some spiderlings. Maybe need a bigger map and new stories too. I think it would be good to add some photos like The Forest did to make us understand the story a lil bit more.

btw, I haven't explored the whole continent, and I still can't find a way in the second lab (still locked), so maybe this is too fast for a review, just, I enjoy this game.

4,73955123,english,"Im going to leave a not recommend for good reasons. However you should get this game when it has more. Here was my experience. 
Graphics: Very Good!
Performance: Ran great, host of game had some issues from amount of entities in our area (eg: grass planks, weed stems, etc) I also crashed twice, fell through world on login, bugs would glitch (mostly spiders), desync with server despite very fast internet on both sides.
Content: Beyond lacking. Now let me say that this game has potential, A LOT of potential. We were just brainstorming things we would like to see such as, paper airplane launcher, grappling hooks, different bugs like wasps and mosquitoes, and all the different items they would bring, almost endless. A good story you can follow and learn about.
Spoiler ahead***You basically learn a scientist fails at his project, goes back to his shrink ray, succeeds (obviously) and thats it. I have 12 hours played, my friend and I had to reddit if there was more, watched videos, read what others have done....nothing. We did everything, built everything, got everything....and part of that was relocating our base out of the oak tree bc the spiders always spawn there, and believe me when i say this, no matter what, they spawn there.
NO DEDICATED SERVER! A player has to launch and run server. That person not on, you play on your own. As previously stated, it caused some host lag.

Final thought: This can be a fantastic game, endless possibilities, fun to play. The only thing is, its no $30 game (right now). If you must play it, wait for it to go on sale. I cant wait to see what happens here and will check on it about every 6 months, maybe longer, thats how much content it lacks right now.

Only a few areas so far (Again early access.)

Fun and engaging game-play.
I really enjoy the miniature design. I hope someone mods in a cat boss at some point.
Most polished survival game at launch I've ever seen. (Obsidian rocks)

Remember when The Forest DIDN'T have the airplane scene and you just woke up in the plane? Like you knew there was maybe a story and that it was clear that the devs were working on a story? Grounded is mechanically like The Forest now and story-wise like The Forest then. 

Despite being almost a clone of The Forest mechanically, there are some huge differences as well. Grounded does not take any mercy on you. Many bugs are hostile and most of the smaller bugs swarm. Spiders will OHKO you and are literally EVERYWHERE. Spiders are like the mid-end game mutants in The Forest. They take a single look at your base and just start blastin'. There are avenues for dealing with them, but as of this review, I haven't tried many of them out yet.

Hands down would recommend this game to anyone i know immediately, now on to the actual review!

This game is much like a mixture of The Forest and Subnautica. If you like any of those two games consider grabbing this beauty. even with The Forest having mutated flesh eating cannibals and Subnautica being filled with loads of potentially deadly aquatic life this game still make a major impact on the survival game community, now you're probably looking at the game right about now saying ""well hey it doesn't look too bad, i might take i peek at the reviews to find out what others experiences are?"" well i'm telling you right now. 
GET IT.
This game has so much potential! (and it's only the beginning!) Grounded even 20 hours in is still providing me with unique experiences, landmarks and challenges to face. The developers behind the making of Grounded have focused into making a playable survival game before focusing on the story (in which they have succeeded mind you) and this is 100% fine, no one would want a game with all of the story content released initially and have a broken and playable experience.

Now for the graphics. These graphics are take home to your parents material, secondly the cartoonish nature of this game really brings out all of the little details and really enhances the experience without any frame loss.

The gameplay, yes you've all been waiting for this part!
this game comes out on top for stable gameplay, yes this review was made in the early access of the game as you can see at the top of this review but DAMN never have i ever seen such well polished A.I even spiders slowly stalk you until they get the right opportunity to pounce! meaning you have to be aware of your surroundings at all times! this even means during the day. Grounded tends to get harder the longer you play much like most other survival crafting horror games no matter how hard you try you can only avoid conflict for so long. every so often you'll have waves of enimies sent to your beautifully build base, as you're standing back and admiring it something is sure to sneak up behind you and wage war.

Grounded is a early access masterpiece! so naturally that means it is still subject to change and still has many updates to come! this is only the foundation of the game, imagine what it will be in a few years heck, maybe even months time! don't pass up an opportunity like this.

anyways enough about blabbering on about this review i'm off to play yet again!

63,73943856,english,"disclaimer: yes we do run into glitches and bugs quite a bit, but it's not deterring us from the otherwise pretty fun gameplay.

Grounded caught me and my friends completely off guard with its beautiful artstyle, small-group-centered coop multiplay (4 players max) and generally very enjoyable Gameplay. 

Compared to other titles on the genre, i would tag it more as a survival light, and it does its job decently at that (medium difficulty is our experience) - You have to manage your hunger and thirst, but its not too much of a hassle, and once you know where to look, its one of these things you just do alongside while youre around on any other tasks. 
Enemies range from ""cute and smack it dead"" with little to no resistance to ""oh crap, that wolf spider caught me off guard and now im getting eaten"" with a lot of in between. About every of the more meaningful enemies has tricks to get the fight done a bit less stressful, but especially on the bigger guys later, when you think theyre no more than pushovers because of your gear / weapon, they can still getcha if you dont pay attention.

The base building is amazing, you can lay out your base as blueprints and the haul in the materials over time. The material grind isnt overly bothersome and feels okay on the amounts you need. Of course a big supercastle will take some time to bring to life, but its still no ridiculous supergrind to grab the resources. If youre the creative type, you can end up with a very fancy place, the game gives you an ok amount of individual building blocks to play around with. I think more will be added in future updates, if i caught that correctly. 

It's a fun promising experience. It lacks content, the current main quest can be finished in some 10 minutes if you really push it, but so far we have been staying busy just kinda playing the game and didnt get bored yet. 
Experience may vary on that last part, of course.

Bugs can be annoying at times, but just recently a couple important ones got fixed, and im pretty confident theyll eventually get it under control.

Overall, recommended for someone who likes himself some casual survival, best with a handful of friends around, too.

20,73934655,english,"This being in early access obviously means there will be a lack in content and loads of bugs, so I won't, unlike many others, point on those two issues which is totally acceptable at this stage. I will however, regarding bugs, say that the feedback/bug report system could be better. They ask us to give feedback but the way to do it is meaningless. To give a sad smiley when you're stuck in the air due to buggy spiderweb doesn't give the developer a good enough basis to fix bugs. WIth that being said I will get down to the review.

I've played a little over 35 hours and I have to say those hours went by really quickly: this game is addictive. I played with my partner and this is a really fun cooperative experience, fighting spiders, building your base. The addictive part is to always wanting to progress, to let your creativity flow when building a house or a fort.

I really like the concept of being the size of an ant, having to worry about small bugs that normally isn't even a nuisance. The game offers both normal monsters which can be killed with one hand and a little tougher ones that require a little finesse, in the beginning. I feel like spiders should be harder. Maybe they've planned on introducing tougher enemies but after only 35 hours wolf spiders shouldn't be a piece of cake.

The base building is really fun and I love the idea that bugs break in and steal your stuff unless you've secured it properly. This is very obvious when you don't build on a base and build on the ground directly: walls, roof and more don't really connect and before I realized you can build floors and clay bases if you progress the ""story"" building a base was a hassle.

Fighting system is fairly basic, nothing special about it really: hack'n slash with the possibility of avoiding damage completely if you parry attacks properly. Weapons break which I like, adds a little more to keep track on and that's a positive. Night time can be dangerous unless you utilize torches, you need to eat, drink but the thing I miss is the need to sleep.

Overall this game is a really fun survival game. It has interesting graphics and I look forward to the full release with more content. This game is a lot more fun when playing with friends (you can play with up to 4 people in a lobby mind you) but is enjoyable by yourself aswell.

It's difficult to give a review to an early access game when the common problems like lack of content, bugs, performance, items, features etc, may be added /fixed as we speak but I will try to give it a go anyway to give an idea of the positves and negatives of the game:

+ Fun concept, shrinking down and having a normal garden as a world to explore is really fun.
+ It's the same feeling you get when playing games like Minecraft: gathering materials and building stuff is almost funnier than the rest of the game
+ If you don't like spiders, there's an option for you to make them look less spider-like.
+ Being a survival game you have to keep track of your food and water intake. And night time makes it harder and unless you utilize torches you won't see bugger all.
+ The game has fun little details like using dandelions to glide in the air, you get stuck in spiderwebs, bug-thieves etc. Small stuff really but adds to the fun.
+ The possibility to add countless of items, monsters in the future. At this stage the game doesn't have a great replay value but it really has potential to be a really good game

- The report system has to get better. It's acceptable to encounter bugs but reporting them needs to be more specific. I don't want to report bugs in the steam review page.
- The difficulty should be adjusted. Much can be adjusted with difficulty but I'd like to see something that cannot be defeated, that HAS to be avoided. I would like to not be able to defeat difficult enemies as fast as I can now.
- Needing to avoid spiders in the beginning is really fun, but when they attack your base, destroy your walls and jump over them it's not as fun anymore when you die and they camp your corpse. Maybe not having the difficult, one-hit-kill monsters attacking your base and spawn point would be a good idea.
- A more detailed option menu is never bad. Having more options is desirable.

Is this game worth the 30 bucks? If you don't forget that this isn't a released game yet and there WILL be bugs, crashes, lack of content and in general stuff to improve then YES. Don't buy this if you expect to have a full released game with hours of content and replay value because at the moment it doesn't.

It's very well done, considering it's early access and there's a bunch of things you can do and enjoy. 

There's still some things that need work, obviously, such as the respawn issue I've ran into that if something runs away from you after you shoot it from up high or somewhere ""safe"", it tends to spawn another one, and the other one walks back. Meaning you could have... oh... 8 wolf spiders instead of 2. There's also some small building errors where things don't ""snap"" properly to existing structures, some floating wall lamps here and there, and the settings don't stick when you turn the game back on. (Curse you motion blur) the NPC occasionally gives you a daily quest of something not yet released in the game as well (Mosquitos, where art thou?) 

However, these are small complaints. I absolutely love the game, and I've been literally enjoying my time playing it. I love playing with the building mechanics and doing literally almost whatever I want, and really look forward to new stuff being added. It's everything I loved about Ark- the building, the exploration, and the sense of wonder as you find new and exciting sights and places.

2. Open World - Building is easy, has unlockables, and can be built almost anywhere on the map. Best part of the game so far is build several bases, different kinds, and how fun it is to upgrade. The farming in this game is just like any other open world game, but resembles don't starve together, where you require a lot of the basic materials to get started, then move forward with tiers of items.

3. Fighting - Fighting mechanic is easy to pick up, and have a moderate skill gap, with the parry function. There are multiple bugs (monsters/creeps) in this game that require no knowledge of attacking/moving/kiting; There are some bugs that you must attack, move to dodge, and kite to no die, and to sustain HP. 

4. Co-op - Right now there is a max of 4 players, and i believe that is a good number. Hopefully in the future they can add dedicated servers and 6 people so there can be a clown fiesta of people fighting off swarms.

- Early Access
- A lot of bugs
- made by the same creators of Out Worlds
- You need a Microsoft account (if you play on a windows PC, you already have one)
- $1 on Xbox PC (Beta) for a month.

After playing for 17 hours i still find new things to do, new builds to try, bugs to overcome, new collectibles to find and more.

Yes, the bugs can be annoying especially some building pieces spawn a TON of larva at your base, however it makes you think outside the box when building your base. Yes, you progress can be wiped without reason. Yes, some have reported microsoft locked their live account for no reason, yes there's A LOT OF PROBLEMS. But this is early access and it is to be expected. 

This game is a lot like The Forest and Raft. If you really enjoy both games i'd recommend getting this game. The game version is at 0.1 but there's already a lot of different armor you can make, a lot of building pieces to play with, and different bugs to overcome!

After playing for 17 hours, yes i recommend this game, but only if you don't mind the bugs and the game being early access. I'm still enjoying myself everyday by playing this game and still have more collectibles to find. And I can't BEGIN to mention how many times i JUMPED from looking into a small cave and finding a HUGE ASS spider inside and jumping out at me... I HATE SPIDERS... SO SO SO SO SO SO SO MUCH.

I've been waiting for a game like this ever since I was a kid and the fact that this is only Early Access blows my mind. I love this game and I hope more and more people support this masterpiece.

The game's a little buggy (not the ones that try to murder you) and there's a handful to brush up on, but for an Early Access game, it runs amazingly. Multiplayer obviously has more issues in terms of gameplay, but I suspect that will improve in time.

If you liked the Forest, you'll love Grounded. 

The attention to detail in the game is incredible and although I don't have the best computer, I am so happy that I am able to play with lowered graphics. Even with the lowered settings, this game still looks absolutely beautiful. 

There's a lot that will be added to the game and I'm excited to see where Grounded ends up. With so much to offer already, this game is only going to get better. Get this game. Support the devs. I would have paid double for this game and still gotten my money's worth.

1. This game's atmosphere and concept are stunning, it's hard to believe that no other game developers have jumped onto the ""Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"" idea, but they haven't and here this game is. With realistic yet slightly cartoony graphics, every time I open the game I feel totally and fully immersed in the world of ""Grounded"".

2. Now that's not to say this game doesn't have it's flaws. It's a little bit pricey for the current content offered but considering that it only came out about a week or so ago, I'll give it some time to flesh itself out. For the content the game does have it's perfectly polished. It feels fair and like I'm really a shrunken child fighting a regular ol' wolf spider with my scrappily made bow and hammer. 

3. I would say if you're going to buy this game then you should buy it with friends, the solo experience is quite difficult considering that you have a whole world to be explored and many insects and arachnids to battle. Without friends the game can seem a bit lonely, like you're the only person in this vast world. So yeah, get some friends, buy it, play it, and have fun.

-Unlocking new gear feels rewarding.
-Multiplayer/Co-op makes the adventures that much more fantastic.

-If you're on steam, you also will need an Xbox Live account (free works) to connect to others in multiplayer

Grounded gives you so much more things so play with, discover and learn. I'm going to list down some of the things I really liked and I disliked about the game (the dislike factor doesn't really matter because it's only in early access):

Pros:
- many things to discover and learn (many items and different areas of the map)
- very cool and individual characters to choose from
- the whole athmosphere of this game is very mysterious (soundtracks and light settings)
- as far as main story goes it's very interesting and makes you wonder what happened
- Beautiful graphics, the insects look disgusting, yet cute :D
- you actually get jumpscares in this game, because some insects sound like they are going to murder you (makes the whole gameplay pretty exciting)
- very creative game in general, especially the details

Cons:
- the design of the characters remind me a little bit of fortnite, which is the only con for me about the graphics, everything else looks stunning
- Some of the insects appear to sometimes bug in a stone (which is actually helpful and not disadvantaging)
- the storyline is very short yet, only about an hour long if you take your time with it and not rush it
- the game crashes sometimes (for me it was 1 time in +10 hours)
- for using mutliplayer you need to create or log into your xbox account and add your friends there. It's not possible playing with your friends over steam only yet.
- the price is a little bit much for an early access game

I'ld say you should buy this game if you are really into survival games and you would like to play a game which is a little bit different than the usual survival games out there and you don't mind playing an early access game with some bugs and a small storyline.

I was looking through online forums for a fix for this and saw that people who didn't have their OS and graphics driver updated were experiencing the same issue. So I checked and saw my graphics needed the update. After updating I jumped back in and still the same thing. I run a 2080 graphics with 32gb of ram and an i9 CPU.

Grounded: The best survival game I have ever played.

The claim I make in the title is quite absurd. I have been playing Minecraft since 2014 and I have had more fun with this game in the past week than I have with that game ever. I of course would never say this is the best game I have ever played, because that would be like marrying someone a week after meeting them.

First I want to break down the pros and cons of this game. I warn that there are not that many HUGE cons, and the pros certainly mean more as the cons are just little issues

Pros:
Very creative concept that is realized to the fullest extent
Monthly updates
Great Visuals

Meh's:
Decent Story

Cons:
No Persistant Servers
Price should be half its cost, but I don't like complaining about price points as they are very circumstantial 
Buggy, but ea so what can you do.

First lets discuss the concept. I can envision a version of this game set in a field or a forest of some sort and not a backyard. But setting this game in a backyard was a stroke of genius. When I first saw the game, I was worried the giant objects would not add to game play. Nope. From a spilled over can of pesticides making a biome toxic requiring a gas mask to explore to juice boxes and soda cans to fill you first, this game is jam packed with 90's inspired environments that you want to just explore every inch of.

The story is a ok. (Spoiler warning)

From what I have gathered the story is what you would think. You are shrunk down by a bad corporation because they are bad, so get big. Also theirs  a mad scientist named Wendall (Who sounds like a rejected Wendys employee) and his robot who also is, you guessed it, crazy. I was some what disappointed because the game is made by Obsidian, so I expected big. I would hope this story is slowly fixed through ea.

On last thing before we wrap up with the cons. I played this game with my mom, and just joining yesterday, my dad. I can confirm its much funner with friends, so find one who has game pass and threaten them with a shrink ray until they want to play.

Please oh please give me persistant servers! I really don't like the hosting system, I want to be able to have a small community we can jump in and out of when we want. The bugs run rampant in more ways then one. I noticed to many too count, but they seem to be patching them on the daily

But who cares get this game, and join the million of us who agree.",1596228103,1596748366,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True,76561198015664914,73,4,2434,0,1894,1598577546

18,73641353,english,"We have played for about 29 hours now so I thought I would give and updated review. 

The story is short but the survival and adventuring aspect definitely holds its own while they continue creating content. I have had zero problems with multiplayer as well so dont let those reviews hold you back. There is a ton of things to create and build in the game that will actually take you a while to do if you try to do all of it. None of the enemies are OP either, some people will argue the spider is OP but honestly once you make the level 1 bow and level 2 ant weapon all you need to do is shoot, block, run, until its dead, and the lady bug armor makes that even easier. There is also a tun of different OS schemes that change the displays for your inventory and crafting to find around the map, I think i have like 15 so far? Still plenty more to find! 

Definitely one of my new favorite games. My wife and I got it on both PC's and played for about 6 hours straight! It gives you a real sense of nostalgia while also providing a fairly challenging and fun experience for the survival genre. If you like other survival games in my opinion this is a must have. I cannot wait for more of the game to be released over time, the forest did a great job and they had a ROUGH alpha compared to this, and I think this game has the potential to be 100x better than that.

Amazingly absorbing game, I am loving it so far. It is gorgeous, and that fact allows the presentation to fill you with a sense of wonder and curiosity I haven't experienced with a game for a very long time. Its been said that this is someone at Obsidian's passion project, and it shows in the loving detail already present in the game. Base building is simple  and mostly intuitive, and resource availability is generous. 

Early Access issues: 
As of now, it *does* crash regularly, and there are some literally game breaking bugs where you may have to start completely over from scratch. There is a pretty limited amount of content at this time, it's possible to do/get everything available within about 10-20 hours of play. Base building is largely optional, and can add quite a bit of game time if you need something to do. 

But if they fixed the progression blocking issues, and never touched it again, I'd still be happy with the time and money I've spent on this. Highly recommended, and definitely something special to watch.

would i recommend this game, kinda wish there was a maybe option, as it stands Grounded is a game with amazing and potentially endless well potential, however as of the moment i write this there is a severe lack of content overall the game is surprisingly polished and relatively bug free ha, if you play solo, online seems to have it's own basket of issues but as i play offline i haven't encountered them. if you enjoy survival crafting games, more specifically the build up to the highest tier and base building the game has a decent amount of replayability even with the severely lacking content. content suggestions past this point. some big things i would like to see if these aren't already planned is a taming system even if it's limited to taming naturally neutral/passive insects like ants and ladybugs but i think most will agree being able to tame and ride a spider into battle would be awesome. another thing but this may be due to me being an ant guy but i would like to see ant alates (flying reproductive ants) appearing at intervals throughout the game and obviously an ant queen another thing would be for crafting stations to pull from nearby containers so you don't have to dig around and pull items out of containers to craft things. oh and if you don't have plans for one, an actual glider, cause the dandelion tuft while nice for breaking falls has really bad horizontal movement and is only really useful as a type of parachute which while useful makes traversal very limited to just running and some climbing. also for bugs that would be cool to see would be some preying mantis, a termite colony, maybe a second ant type, which you could find competing with the ants already here for food and territory maybe make it a sort of world event where if you kill a species ant queen over time those ants die out and the other species in game takes over the others nest but that may be a bit complex. also something that may be interesting is if the ants corral and protect aphids, as this is something real life ants do to milk them for lack of a better word of their honeydew. also maybe make spiders a bit more aggressive to other insects cause seriously, having a spider just walts into an anthill and have nothing happen makes 0 sense and is a little weird to watch, or have a ladybug just walk up and have a chat with a wolf spider, the only time insects attack other insects is if they get attacked themselves which makes 0 sense as spiders are predatory, why do they not y'know hunt and stuff. so while i pretty much guarantee the devs won't see this, here were a few thoughts on possible future features on grounded, thank you for listening to my ted talk,

TL:DR this game is decent already if you like building and gathering and the beginning process of a survival crafting game, but the end game doesn't really exist atm, you only have like the first 8 ish hours of content and the first 30 minutes of story, Grounded has amazing potential and i gave a few ideas for features :)",1596731436,1596731436,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True,76561198045214274,106,2,2067,0,2011,1599116644

Personal Opinion time. 

Is this game good? Hell yeah!
Did I scream because of my insect phobia? Oh fuck yeah!
This Game in my head deserves a Horror genere! But only because I'm a scaredy little whimp.

Anyway, This game has tons of potential and I can see mods with this game going hand in hand.
It has a lot to offer already and I am excited for the continued story! Base building, exploration.
The map UI could be a little better but it is in early access.

Sure it is a little pricey so keep in mind this is a specific type of Game catering to certain types of gamers.
If you like survival with scary overgrown yet realistic creatures, this might be your game!

The price of 29.99 EUR is completely unjustified considering the content that comes with it, but having in mind the reputation of Obsidian, it is expected that the price will be higher by 20-50% compared to Indie (unknown) studies that have yet to gain their reputation.

To get right to the point, what doesn’t justify the price and what I personally didn’t like is the EXPLORING feature of the game in an unfinished world! At one point you no longer know if what you EXPLORE exists in the game at all or not !? Is what you are looking for in the game or not? etc.

I understand Obsidian and their MYSTERY system in games, but I don't understand that this system can be applied to an unfinished game whose main feature is EXPLORING. What should I look for and explore if I'm not sure that they even added it to the game, and let's just say it's realistic that it's in some places!
When they add to the game things that are ""realistic"" to be there and that they will most likely add in later updates, then the game should show all its potential, I guess!

On the other hand, the base building, combat system, crafting are pretty well done so there aren't too many objections really, maybe some ""combo punches"" in the combat would further improve the game and break the monotony of the BLOCK / HIT system but I think they should be taken seriously first have filling out the EXPLORING piece that is more than necessary for such a unique world that I have been waiting to be a part of since “Honey, I Shrunk the Kids” a movie I was a big fan of when I was a boy.",1596714029,1596714029,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True,76561198062177161,490,18,1691,0,1593,1596804615

We were so desperate we tried changing hosts which means you have to start over with a new save. It kept happening to all four of us. People in our twitch chat told us that apparently the PC version of the game was broken for multiplayer and that they had similar experiences.

tl;dr It has a lot of promise and I'll revisit it later to see how it's improved, but for now it's a pass.

It's looks fantastic, and exploring a good sized backyard is a lot of fun. 
The problems arise when you are exploring and get ganked by a spider through a barrier or just because you didn't see it coming up on you. Until you're well-geared, all the spiders will one-shot you. Then you respawn and there's 3 larvae hanging out there who immediately kill you, and then just wait for you to respawn and kill you over and over. You could build a base, but alas while you were out the game spawned 5 soldier ants in it.  So instead you respawn in a tiny killbox full of murderous ants.
The base building handles like it does in The Forest, but not as robust yet. I had an ant destroy a wall because he got partially caught in the geometry of it and dug his way out.
I only got to play it single-player, and I'm sure multi will make the whole ordeal less painful, but for now it's just not that good.


Edit:
I've watched several livestreams with 2-4 people playing together and it completely alters the flow and feel of the game. You have friends to play with, it looks like a ton of fun. I would say it's worth it in that case, even though the story content only covers the first 20ish minutes of gameplay right now. There's a lot of yard to explore and dangers to face.

This I'm impressed with!  I watched a bunch of youtubers play it, and despite the screaming from spiders at first, I got right into it.  The game may feel like it ""lacks content"", but so far I've been spending hours just building bases to expand and get out there to explore my own backyard.  It may not have an actual ""sandbox"" mode but that hasn't stopped me from taking my time and doing my own thing.  Nothing says you have to rush from objective to objective.  You can explore, go find easter eggs and secrets, and just learn how to craft the world before doing much more than the first few objectives.

92,73521495,english,"EDIT: 
I've played now for 51 hours as of this review, I'm updating from my first review when I was only 11 hours in. I'm still enjoying the game. I still would recommend the game but there are some issues which I ran into which were very annoying and so I now recommend the game with a disclaimer. I can get in and enjoy the game for what it is but there are some issues which are really annoying and I would love to hear feedback from the devs on these issues. Let me list a few things:
1. The door locked at the Oaktree lab -  (there's a work around, though not an easy one, you can go in the back way through the Anthill).
2. So after the lab door closes and you can't access the lab anymore, as a work around, you can restart the game. After restarting I realized that all the locations that I had initially found that had 500 science points, these locations do not have the 500 points anymore so restarting kind of sucks b/c now you will have to work really hard to get all those points back, and this is due to the bug from #1. 
3. I'm fairly patient, so I decided to push forward and attempt to keep going with the first game, just accessing the lab via the anthill. Now I ran into, the worst bug so far for me, time has stopped at 6am. Everything in the game is time-based so nothing grows, you can't analyze anything, you will eventually run out of water since there is no more dew, etc. 

You can always create another game, but you get less science for some reason and that is a barrier for me b/c I love games like this but grinding again and again is not fun and definitely not my thing. The other obvious thing is that the game is in early access so there isn't much story, and so I assume the bugs will be fixed eventually. The game is playable,  and can be fun at times, I will come back to it after they fix some bugs myself.

The map does not change, from something I read it will always be the same, probably to keep the story points in place but having either more maps or a procedurally generated map may help keep folks interested in the game for a longer amount of time.",1596126089,1596704575,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True,76561198052262355,129,10,4375,0,700,1598564193
93,73853918,english,I've played about 5 hours with my friends and i will say its a lot of fun for the moment since there is still stuff to grind 5 hours in. There are some things that i would like to see fixed like building can be very glitched at points and it wont line up and it can get really annoying when trying to set up on rocks. combat is ok but some of the weapons have a weird buffer when trying to block that makes it a little hard to fight some things that do a lot of damage and in single player where you cant really try and spread the aggro it can be a little  hard without gear and i think that takes away from a lot of the fun early game. with all that said i really like this game i like the setting and i cant wait for more areas and enemies to be added and i hope its a big update since it needs way more content at the moment since going to new areas is a lot of the fun looking forward to the update,1596703535,1596703535,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True,76561198141999780,103,1,298,0,298,1596699831

The Good: Art direction, feel of scale, crafting, research system.

The Obviously-will-be-improved: Story length isn't very long, but this is an early access game. Definitely will have more items to craft and bugs to fight.

[b] Discount Playtime, Listen To Review [/b]

This game is AMAZING! 
Have you ever wanted to enjoy [i] The Forest [/i] with your family, but you didn't want all the blood, gore and inappropriate body parts flailing about? Well, this is DEFINITELY [i] THE GAME [/i] for you!

I just got off of this game with my best friend, which I had bought because he had it on Xbox Game Pass. I saw this game all over YouTube, with all the gaming channels playing demos or the full game and showing off how amazing it is. I desperately wanted to try this game out and my best friend gave me the greatest excuse to.

Here are something I'm going to talk about:
a.) Gameplay
b.) Graphics
c.) Story
and...
d.) Technical

[b] Game play: [/b]
The game play for this game is extremely simple, build, survive and explore. Kill bugs, craft armor, and find new designs for upgraded weapons or the such. It's like [i] The Forest [/i] but it is simple and not very scary. you can go anywhere and do whatever you want, as long as you stay hydrated and eat. Also, defend yourself from mean bugs. Again, the world is free to explore in this game, you're only held back by the boundaries and possibly big scary bugs.You can also craft little furniture or stuffed animals. it's pretty cool!

[b] Graphics: [/b]
The graphics in this game are beautiful! The grass, soil, and bugs are very cartoon-y. Nothing is the game is too realistic, with exceptions, but most things are caricatures of their real life counter parts. The lighting and distant landmarks are beautiful, especially at night time, but the slight blur makes the game feel weird on the eyes. All the graphic settings are easy to adjust, but there aren't that many to play around with. Hopefully, more stuff will come to Steam Players.

[b] Story: [/b]
The story for this game is already more interesting than most survival games. You're 4 kids who are shrunken by a weird machine. You have no idea how you ended up there or who did it to you, but you can collect little tapes that help you understand the story a little better. It's a lot like [i] Honey I Shrunk The Kids [/i] but with more action. The story, at this time, is still incomplete and there are plans to continue the story at a later date. Knowing Xbox, they'll have more parts of the story out quickly, but i wouldn't put too much hope into that just yet.

[b] Technical [/b]
Firstly, I wanna talk about the Multiplayer, You have to have an Xbox Account to play Online, but that isn't too bad, if you already have an account. But, it's free to play online, if you're using Steam. very simple, not much to complain about. 
The map, it's big but not that big. There are very interesting landmarks outside of the map that seem a tad bit more interesting, hopefully they become levels for us to play. Some bits of the map have nothing interesting except for a land mark, but that is about it.
The glitches are small, not game breaking, but they can be a hindrance on fun! 
The voice acting is on point and I can't wait to see what more lines they add. 
The arachnophobia setting is genius, it's extremely helpful.
Lastly, crafting better items can be a bit of a head turner, if you don't know what you're doing.

[b] Overall: [/b]
This game is AMAZING! It's fun and exciting, it has all that it really needs to be a great multiplayer game, but the small things can make a big difference. I hope that Xbox Game Studios continues to pour a lot of time and effort into this game, because it truly deserves all the love from it's community and developers. I really hope that Xbox and Microsoft continue forward with this game, because it has so much potential. Hopefully this doesn't get popular and then they just ditch the project, like a lot of other great titles.

I highly recommend playing/buying this game, but I would also give it time, it's still taking its baby steps.

I don't leave reviews very often. Today Grounded is getting a review because I love the this game so far. My friend loves survival games and I typically get tired of them. This is the first we have both been able to enjoy long term. I may not have the patience for this game if I weren't playing with a friend.
There are cons... the phrase that sums this up for me is ""this feels like Wolcen...""(sloppy). The only saving grace is that is it's early access status. In Grounded's case I think it is fair for this game to have occasional bugs.
The problem is they are often game breaking bugs.

Game crashes to desktop
*When I respawn after death, so far these have happened*
camera tilts about 15 degrees to the right
I lose all my inventory
In bleedout state I cannot give up I have to wait out the timer
*workaround*
The work around to most of these  is to revert to an autosave and switch characters.

26,73845507,english,"[h2]Introduction[/h2]
The game has about 10 hours of content in this version if your not rushing into the story and you are trying to build a base to store your collectables.
I have pros and cons about this game but I do believe it has potential, it has performance issues and glitches, cross platform compatibility needs clearing up as you need to follow a process to join friends games for which no one outlined a very important step that was not listed in the articles.
IF you have a Microsoft Live account, add people on it as friends you want to play with otherwise don't expect being on steam to allow you to see friends in this version of the game.

For pros and Cons.

[h2]Pros[/h2] 
- It's fun to find new strategies to fight different insects, this adds a level of thinking to the game.
- Spider's are fun to have to try and avoid from time to time, in open areas and getting on top of high places.
- Climbing the logs for tree sap is cool, it gives you a reason to climb and then your just amazed by the environment and the ability to help your team mates navigate around spiders. Their is also a Demonic head in the game :O
- I am constantly trying to improve out builds and layouts while also obtaining better gear. It's fun to get something a bit better that makes fighting easy! (Not Wolf Spider's though. Still quite a challenge.)


[h2]Cons[/h2]
- The early game feels unbalanced. I am constantly trying to build a base while either having my stuff taken away from me by ants or destroyed by Larva who keep spawning in my base. It's frustrating The doors were shut, their were spike traps at the doors... They were just a cluster inside the base. Starting off as 2 and then 3 then 5.
- Spider's are way to dangerous to the player early game, they can see you from way further away seemingly at night suggesting their vision is better at night than in the day. They are way to fast for the player and it's almost impossible to survive an encounter unless you have a base or hide in a building.
- Water resources from the grass leafs are far too sparse to find and don't always respawn. Early game killing bugs for food to which satisfy hunger while Slurping from a lake is the only way to really survive in a team effectively as the bugs hunger overcomes your loss from slurping lakes and murky waters.
- I have no ways to place markers on the map to help me locate where I want to go and where I am going. I want to place custom markers because my base maybe in a weird spot, and their is no navigational equipment without opening a map. It worked well for me but other players are a little annoyed to not have a mini-map or compass to navigate with.
- Crafting items feels a bit too slow and tedious to wait to hit a button and craft.
- Dropping items is annoying and slow.
- Transferring items between containers is also tedious and slow. I want to shift click straight over on PC. On a controller holding a button and clicking the stack would be cool as well!
- Armor equips and weapon equips feel weird as they don't go into the slots. It reminds me of older games like Champions or Norrath where you equip an item yet it's highlighted and still in your inventory. It would be good if when I pickup my bag those items also auto equipped instead of just my hot bar. I don't know if my armor is on or not otherwise.

[h2]Bugs and Glitches[/h2]
Bug- When the game crashes in multiplayer it's possible other players will spawn as if they had no gear at the start of the level, frustrated and angry about their hard earned gear being lost over a game crash.
Bug- It's frustrating to try and save a player only to be Holding E and then suddenly it stops trying to help them. Also in combat situations when your fighting it sometimes trys to heal a player mid air. IDK why that happened. So I can't include it as it's own bug.
Bug- Between players in Multiplayer some items appear visible, not collectable and you may not collect those items.
Bug- If your inventory is full and you kill something only to attempt to collect items, it seems to destroy everything. This was horrible in two occasions after beating a Lady Bug and our Wolf Spider friend.
Bug- Bug's keep spawning in my bases and sometimes even walk through walls. IT'S ANNOYING! Especially Larva who destroy everything! Ant's... I watched them walk through a wall... Open doors and okay... They can open doors? Okay. give me a padlock or something!
Bug- When I healed someone they were able to get up and back into the fight while I was still in the state of trying to heal them, my game broke and I got knocked out and we died as a result.

Glitch- Jumping on walls will teleport you up and down a foot sometimes.
Glitch- walking on Grass planks while looking around twists out the camera like crazy!
Glitch- You can break spider AI by getting it to attack into a place it can not move from I've cheesed multiple spiders into this situation and it's easy to now kill them in a set of certain circumstances.
Glitch - When transferring items into a container it can sometimes destroy items, overriding that item in the chest potentially in the process. This was from MP, each game mode may have different results and scenarios.

[h2]End notes:[/h2]
The game may seem like it has a lot of bugs and issues, regardless I think the pros are enough of a reason to play the game and the cons are things the developers need to look into and try to work out!

If the developer's are Interested in having some [b]QA[/b] done they may [u]get in touch with me professionally[/u] and each issue will be better documented and produced. From game balancing to the bugs. 
This game has potential regardless of some hiccups of being early access with bugs, it's price point seems a bit high and people in the community criticising the developers who are making a game they don't seem to be experts in making. I disagree, The developers have some fun experiences and the game does in someways seem to try and cater to a younger audience in it's child like appearance and bug like environments. But it also tries to cater to an older audience with it's difficulty and different ways of challenging a player to fight with strategy.

Also I watched Markiplier's video (Part 2) on this and it seems their maybe some mature seeming jokes that Adult's may read between the lines on which kids will not.",1596685903,1596686600,True,56,3,0.763601958751678467,4,True,False,True,76561198044663527,279,11,1014,0,860,1597067598

There are some bugs in the game, but nothing ground breaking in my own experience, I only ran into 1 crash in my time playing (I have more hours than my steam says).
Enemies frequently get caught on walls and cannot move anymore, but it doesn't break the game, just your immersion.

Honey I shrunk the kids meets survival.
First of all, yes this is an Early Access game and yes there are bugs within the game play at times. However, so far I have not encountered any bugs that have been serious or really affected my game play. 
Pros:
The environments are gorgeous but don't be fooled by the cute character designs as this game will make you scream, especially if you aren't good with spiders (I am terrible with spiders) the creature designs are sometimes a little too good especially when it comes to the wolf spiders they really make me uneasy but yet I still refuse to play in the arachnophobia mode... Base building is great fun and is very well executed compared to many other building games, you want to build a base on a baseball..sure go for it. 

Cons
As stated its early access so expect a few bugs 
Very little story/campaign so far (tho they are aiming for monthly updates)

*The Story as of initial release does only last 20 or so minutes, but the Progression of equipment and base making can take you further into the 20 hour mark of playtime.

Since it is such early access.. there are a few glitches here and there.. but nothing to deter me from still wanting to play.. 
I'm not sure if this can just happen.. or if it's an actual bug [haha.. unintentional pun].. but I built up and enclosed a base.. yet ants are still getting into the base and stealing all my snacks in storage.. [which I know stealing snacks is a thing they do.. they're ants after all!].. I have no idea how they are getting in either.. they just show up out of nowhere!
A glitch I love is when a spider gets stuck in one of the places you can go to to analyze stuff.. and then it's just an analyzing pod thingy with spider legs.. [Seems to be the only way I can kill a spider.. so I am perfectly okay with that!]

Something I also found before even starting to play.. was when I tried to login to my Xbox Live account.. every time I tried to type 'A' it would take me to the game options.. so I ended up having to copy and paste an 'A' every time I needed to type it to login.. So that needs to get fixed.. 

I also find the whole in-game menu a little weird.. just so many different buttons you have to use.. or have to click.. I wish 'TAB' could just take you to inventory and then all the other options.. I tried changing stuff around.. but.. OOF.. that was just ridiculous.. [I know it's not fair to compare a brand new early access game to ones that have been out for a while.. but something like how 7 Days to Die is laid out would be nice.. that'd be perfect honestly!].. 

Any who.. I love forward to see this game develop more and more.. I know there will be bugs and glitches here and there through it all.. but I'm excited to see the progress.. It's already a beautiful looking game.. the graphics are AMAZING! And it has ENORMOUS potential!

19,73827540,english,"Some say the open world survival genre has been overdone. My question is, was it ever done right?

I have been a survival game fanatic since the first week Ark was posted on steam. This game takes all of the good things survival has done and shaves off all of the bad. It simplifies everything down and focuses on what a survival game really about, and what makes it fun. There are definitely early access bugs, but I'm sure they will be ironed out soon.

Pros:
- fun enemies
- great combat (I mean you can hurl literally anything in your hand)
- seems pretty balanced even this early. ex: even with the strongest armor enemies are still fun and challenging to fight. not to challenging though:)
- lots of armor variety (hopefully more to come)
- beautiful scenery
- game plays super smoothly
- lots of exploration and discovery
- even though the art is stylized and cartoony, there's still thrilling jump scares and a sense of danger

Cons (hard to say any of these because it's early access but):
- enemies sometimes clip into or spawn in your base
- enemy ai need some work

Not really Pro or Con... just neutral thoughts I guess:
- weapons have great variety in play style but not many variants which I would love to see (also better uniques)
- price. I'm fine with paying the $30 to support a good game with tons of potential. i'd rather pay more now so the studio has the funds to keep updating it than not pay enough and the studio gives up on it before it can really blossom.

In conclusion, it's been a long time since I've seen a game that has excited me as much as this one. If you are a fan of the open world survival genre I highly recommend you try this game out and support the studio.

1. No compass? I have to keep pressing M to keep seeing where I am.
2. Getting stuck in grass
3. No tutorial in the beginning. It would be nice if there was a tutorial on how to get food and water and also crafting. The game throws you in there expecting you to know this. Once this game gets a more proper tutorial and helps its users I would recommend people who are interested to wait until they get it, or unless you know how to play then by all means come

After playing for some time, the game is definitely fun. It still feels I am wandering around aimlessly, trying to figure it out. The multiplayer mode isn't up and running yet which sucks because I want to play this game with people.

I am no at all disappointed. 
Only in Alpha, I already feel like I got my $29.99 back.
The game's overall vibe/feel is amazing. It is just like Honey I Shrunk the Kids in a Pixar movie.
The game has survival, exploration, combat, and base building. When you add it all together it creates a really engaging experience. I play grounded on Steam and it ports perfectly from X box to pc. You can tell (for the most part) that they were thinking of the PC when developing the game.
One of the best aspects of this game is that unlike ""most"" games out there, this one is a family friendly game. 
OK, so now for suggestions for Microsoft (should they accidentally click on this review and read this):
1. Server stability/crashes and saving progression. This is the only game breaker. The host has virtually no problems, but friends joining into the game might have difficulties such as: Game Sync errors: not seeing the blueberries in the same spot as the host (or not at all). Complete server issues: Extreme lag, and or loss of inventory. Falling through bases etc.
2. Quality of life, mainly around inventory management. I realize this is developed primarily for the X-box. The GREAT news is that the controls and movement feel perfect on the PC. The problem is that some quality of life problems exist. If one looks at just about any MMO or games with heavy inventory management such as Tarkov, then there are shortcuts such as ctrl + left lick or shift + left lick to move whole stacks of items from a container to the inventory. I realize there aren't as many options on a controller but there probably should be some ""alternative"" toggle or control to allow ease of inventory management.
3. Players and the community are eager for more content. HOWEVER, I would love to see fixes to the above issues and making what is already there, better before adding in new stuff.

It's similar to The Forest, yet infinitely scarier. With identical building/gathering mechanics, and even an underlying story. Grounded stands on its own though, with fun gameplay, a beautiful atmosphere, and interesting enemies. From regular worker ants to ladybugs, and even Wolf Spiders. Not everything is wonderful though, the hunger/thirst system is a hindrance. Forcing you to stop very often to eat and drink. Only offering realism it's a dated mechanic that can make survival games a chore, in my opinion.

Fortunately the game succeeds everywhere else. It's a fun and exciting game. Vastly better with friends. Despite the small story, it's well worth the $30 price tag right now. There is so much more content to be added. With a full release planned next year. Easily an 8/10 for me.

54,73682452,english,"The big question “Is it worth 30 bucks??”    Ask yourself:

1)	Do you like exploration?

2)	Do you like discovering new and exciting items to craft?  These items can be weapons, apparel, building materials, home décor, food, smoothies!

3)	Do you like being scared out of your wits sometimes?

4)	Do you like looking out over the landscape in a game and wonder…is it safe to go that way?

5)	Are you afraid of spiders?

6)	Do you like building your own safe base?  (then get it off the ground!!!)

7)	Do you like thinking for yourself trying to figure out how to survive in the cruel world of insects? Let’s face it, the insect world is cruel.

8)	Would you kill a ladybug?  (please say NO! although they will scare the pants off of you because they are like a bulldozer coming through the grass!)

If you answered yes to these questions (except killing a ladybug!) then you may want to try this game.

This game is being created by 2 of the biggest software houses in the world and the possibilities of this game are as endless as the insect world itself.

Some people complain about content.  Seriously, it’s a survival game and surviving IS the content.  That being said, I have yet to find and end to the quests being given to me.  Story line?  It is still being developed but again, what type of story are you really wanting in a survival game?

Biggest tips I can give anyone is Do the quests and DON'T BUILD ON THE GROUND!  Learn how to build scaffolds and build on top of those.
If you store food in a container on the ground then you can be assured it will be raided by ants and larvae and they will destroy your stuff to get the food.  Think about it.  Food on the ground…ants…yeah nuff said.  Good bait tho if you are hunting for ants.
I have almost 20 hours in and now have a 3 story house (on stilts) and still have quests to do.  As far as tier 1 items to craft, I have not discovered them all yet and have not even started on tier 2.

One of my favorite experiences was when I first saw a spider web.  Hmmm nothing around it.  I wonder if the programmers made the web sticky…so snuck up and I touched it.  Hey I’m stuck..Stuck..STUCK!!  OMG, grab the pebble axe and start chopping…wait..is .. is that grass moving…is it moving, and my way!  OMG IT IS…Chop Chop…it’s still coming my way…AAAH! IT’S A SPIDER!!! CHOP CHOP CHOP!!  Right before the spider got me the web broke and I was free.  IM FREE RUN FOREST RUN!  And I ran like a scared little boy.  If you zig zag through the tall grass the spider can not keep up and you can out run it.  Whew!  Then to my surprise I realized I had been collecting the silk from the web and learned how to make my first dew catcher!  YUM Fresh water!

Obsidian did a great job with this game, and I'm enjoying it thoroughly so far.

Systems feel intuitive, spiders are terrifying every single time. So far I've only had one crash, and that was when I tried to cook food. Hasn't happened again since, though, so I'm not worried.
Base building, though. Yikes. While it's great to build a base, it's a very clunky system that's in desperate need of refining.

HOWEVER

downsides:
* Serious crashes daily, can make you a bit annoyed.
* Lack of content, very little of the story is completed.
* bugs can be buggy and get stuck in various places (under rocks and terrain)
* Spawns of enemies are unbalanced.

What I like about the game:
* Daily quests with a point system allows you to buy uppgrades for tools and other stuff
* Building is very easy to understand and decent amount of ""puzzle pieces"" (hope to see more added)
* combat feels satisfying.

Keep in mind this is very early access and I hope the devs fix a lot of the bugs really soon!

3,73801184,english,"Probably closer related to The Forest than any other survival sandbox, Grounded is a fairly streamlined affair without being overly simple. Story-focused with pre-made characters, whilst there is plenty of sandboxing to be done, there is a definitive goal to guide you along and give you something to aim for.

Compared to The Forest, Grounded has a lot more content going for it, at least in terms of crafting and base-building. But at the same time, it lacks the complicated gameplay of games like Ark. Thus, the game is both accessible and challenging. And boy, do the hostile bugs pose a challenge. I've never actually found a wolf spider to be scary before this game, and dang are those things terrifying when you're shrunk down to ant-like proportions.

There's certainly no shortage of humour either, nor polish or - certainly compared to the norm with these sorts of games - decent graphics. However, the game could do with some optimisation, as I personally find random stuttery spikes for seemingly no noticeable reason, that last for a good few seconds before subsiding.

In essence, Grounded is probably what you'd expect from a not-quite AAA attempt at a survival sandbox (as the game is developed, as I understand it, by a small team within Obsidian rather than the full force of the entire company). Decent and fun from the offset of early access status (certainly a lot better than most of the more well-known indie titles were at this stage of development).",1596612527,1596612527,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True,76561198016880157,320,47,832,0,292,1596876114

I do think 30$ is a bit too much with where the game stands, bc overall you can maybe get a good 20 hours out of the game if you REALLY stretch it, however the time that I've put into it feels well spent and rewarding. The atmosphere in the game is fantastic and the fact that there hasn't been a game with this idea yet surprises. Some people say that the difficulty is too hard, but i completely disagree. I feel that the natural progression of gear is fair and that its feasible to beat all enemies if you have the right strategy. Also I don't think some people realize there's a lower difficulty setting that they can play if its too challenging. Currently I'm sitting at about 12 hours into the game and I've had a lot of fun so far, however I have hit a bit of a wall. At this point there's not really much to do anymore. The story will only occupy about 30 minutes to an hour of your time and the rest of your time will most likely be spent on base building and getting better gear. As entertaining as that is there are some bugs that should be addressed. The building is a bit confusing but if you commit to learning it you eventually figure out. One other bug is that sometimes you'll crash and come back in through an autosave, however you'll have a different inventory from earlier but still the same progression in terms of your base and whatever is in your chests. Not a major bug, will lose you maybe 45 minutes in the long run. Can't wait to see where Obsidian takes this game, I think they already have a really good base.

Single player seems to be at least playable while multiplayer is a nightmare. I had to have my buddy guide me to things that weren't on my screen but were on his. That goes for enemies too. You can end up taking damage and not know here it even came from. Connection to the host server is always poor it seems which creates problems in itself. There is no story or campaign at the moment so unless you enjoy figuring things out or googling constantly it can be annoying. I am not familiar with this Dev company so i am unsure of their reputation with pre-release/Betas. If they are going to sit on this for a few years like the rest of the industry does it will be very unfortunate.

It seems people want to be angry at an early access game, for issues that are part of the parcel with it being in early access. 

Please don't be stupid. Please don't cry about spiders. 

This game does suffer from a few glitches that need ironing out. The game's survival aspects are a bit too easy, with water and food being plentiful. However, most other resources are well placed out and require you to venture, fight and plan your way to acquire them. This is where the game is. The game allows you to handle enemies in a variety of ways. Using the  environment to your advantage when dealing with larger bugs, setting up traps to bait enemies in small tunnels, making the right armour or weapons to nudge the odds in your favour. A genuine issue is that the game has sacrificed difficulty for accessibility. With that, the game is extraordinarily easy to pick up, the learning curve is as smooth as a lot of the negative reviewer's brains are. 

It hurts my head to see people whining about story and glitches in a early-access survival game that is still wet behind the ears.",1596598762,1596598762,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True,76561198069758759,250,10,597,0,371,1596963931

You can finish the story with barebone resources such as a spear, and armor and thats really it. Heres a pro/con list of The Honey I Shrunk the Kids Game, ""Grounded""

Pros: 
#1. Good base building mechanics and you dont need the exact resources at the time you place it.
#2. The little robot you meet after you finish the story is SOOO cute and the way you can buy things from him to make an after game is really nice, although i expect it to not be permanent.
#3. The way (most) ants aren't hostile towards you is really nice, and the fact they will attack ""Weevils"" at any cost really adds personality to the ants.
Cons.
#1. Hostile and passive creatures will often get stuck in walls and can make combat incredibly easy.
#2. The building is incredibly buggy making it hard to actually build a huge base, but not game breaking.
#3. It has a lack of REAL story content, yet this will be expanded upon soon. 

A little nitpick, but not a con, is the fact you have to fight a practical boss to get the spider armor, yet the ladybug armor is better???? Why? Its more of a flex than a ""good"" armor set.
Overall rating 7/10. Its incredibly addictive however, so take that rating with a grain of salt.
Its a good survival basebuilding sandbox game, but not one the best; although it has the potential to be one.
Its not a ""Minecraft"" or ""Terraria"" ripoff either, all of them are there own games and needed to be treated like one.
My hour count may not sound impressive (19 hours) But thats amassed of 2 days. 9 and a 1/2 hours a day, so buy it if you have the money to spend. It will only get more expensive, (in early access.) so buy it while you can.

67,73780061,english,"This is my first ever review for a game in a long time and after playing this a while i thought it wouldnt hurt to leave one here.

I really love the art and concept of this game, the honey i shrunk the kids mixed with a bugs life story is a unique twist for a survival game. and would love to see this game progress more and more in its development. there are a few flaws I like to point out..

While I love the game and the sense of difficulty i feel that the difficulty is way too much for new players that are trying to unlock items to deal with bugs. so far my only problems are with spiders in the game. they appear way too common and near the early part of the game. 

i know there needs to be a challenge and spiders are meant to be tough but it basically discourages me to keep going at times. killed 1 wolf spider by luck when it got stuck with bow and arrows then jumped on immediately by another, and on mild which i assume is the easy difficulty? now i know the game is early access but i feel spiders should be a rare spawn in my opinion due to how much of a threat they are. it gives the player a chance to be prepared. I haven't had a chance to build my base due to them which i hope gets tweaked in the future. i would hide in a machine near the starting area or the lab but it seems to glitch itself through to hit me enough to kill me. even if i hide inside something where it is unable to reach me the spider will stay until I am dead but will return once i go back for my items.. 

I would love to recommend this game cause I can see potential in this but I would recommend waiting and see what comes in updates cause for a game that's 30$ is steep for a game riddled with a few bugs and insane difficulty. 

I chose recommended only because I can see this game be really good later on and i hate to give it a not recommendation status... but its up to you to decide if its worth getting for yourself",1596586243,1596586243,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True,76561198083688395,101,2,499,0,239,1596816555

The research function for finding new blueprints is nice since it means you don't get have to have a team of people to build a whole base. I like how you obtain resources by carrying the stuff too large to fit in your inventory and the equipment tiers, armor sets, and various tools are all neat, well crafted, and thought out. The combat feels well balanced.

Cons: Buildings are way too brittle. Even the smallest creature seems to be destroying parts of my house in three hits or less with larger creatures one and two shotting the walls leaving me wondering why even bother building a base. This needs to be improved drastically. There is also currently a bug in the game that allows monsters to spawn inside of your house and or inside of your walls so hopefully that gets fixed. There also seems to be a bug when wielding the 2 handed ant axe that makes mobs unable to attack you at all, allowing me to run into a pack of four or five orb weavers and kill them all without taking any damage.",1596584783,1596584783,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True,76561197963222184,358,1,1080,0,874,1596750820

Personally I like this game but the price it to high considering there is no public mode for the multiplayer.

I think this would be a great game if there where mods and a public mode with more characters so people could make new gamemodes like RP or survival more like the forrest. 

All in all a good game but does not really have a good multiplayer platform.",1596581266,1596581816,False,2,1,0.423727035522460938,0,True,False,True,76561198000767222,140,3,75,0,75,1596517177
77,73755725,english,"This short review is from someone that does not play survival games, so for me this was a culpusive buy. Plus I normally play fps games, and mainly full on action games to. 

When Grounded got released I watched many live streams on here and videos off YouTube, and to be honest I was intruiged with the game so much that I just had to give it a go. 

First off the graphics are gorgeous to say the least, the unreal engine is put to great use in this game. 
Sound is good and music for what there is just sets the overall atmosphere around you. But the main title music is just dam awsome, and reminds me of Stranger things series in many ways. 

Gameplay, so as iam sure you already know this is a survival crafting game which takes place in your garden. But something went wrong and you were shrunk to a tiny size, so the game world around you is massive in size. 

Now coming from someone who normaly is not good at these sort of games, well I found the crafting very easy to do, and believe me that's saying something for me lol. 

So your main threat is the creepy crawlys in the garden, which can and will give you a bad day.
So you can craft weapons and find new resources to anylise from the research tents dotted around the garden. 
But you can also craft and build a house or fortress to protect you to, well from gathering resources from around the garden. 

As being a early access game there's lots more which will be added down the game development root. 
So from the information I know, there will be a bigger expansions to the main game size map. Also more creepy crawlys are on there way, and weather conditions to like rain I heard which would be amazing. But the game has day and night cycles which you can speed up when you sleep to make it day time again quicker. But you need to build a basic shelter or a house ect. 

A special mention must go to the graphics as they are outstanding, and the bugs are just awsome to look at like the rest of the game world. 
But oh boy, if you don't like spiders in the real world like me, well you won't like them  in this game. They creep me out so much, and I remember passing a leaf which underneath it was a very big spider hundled in there sleeping, which gave me nightmares that night sleeping lol. 

So I guess from my review I can honestly say  buy this game if you like survival crafting games, it's just a awsome game so far even at this stage of early access. 
So far there's a bit of the story content added, but much more will be added through the games development. 
But to be honest just the free roaming aspect of the game makes it a instant buy anyway. As that part of the game will tell your own story weather it be on your own or Co op with other people. 

It's been a strange year for me for gaming, and 3 titles so far by smaller development teams have just shocked me for quality games. 
Those 3 are Deep Rock galactic, Hyper Charged unboxed and of course Grounded. 

So I whole heartedly recommend this, and what have you got to loose. As there's always the refund option, but iam sure you won't take that option though. 

Thanks for reading my review, and please read others as I know I have missed alot of the finer details. 😊",1596554690,1596581536,True,1,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,True,76561198014685360,449,49,144,0,144,1596481811
78,73777750,english,"Things I liked:
-enjoy the concept, think it has a lot of potential. Minus the immense about of glitches and set backs.
Things I disliked:
-no point in attempting to build a base. Just ends up getting greifed by the bugs. They genuinely wont stop attacking the base until it is entirely demolished, even with no food or anything of value in it. It just doesn't make sense, seems like the bugs are programmed to destroy whatever you've attempted to build. 
-no access to items that actually give you a chance against the bugs. I wouldn't be worried about it, but from the looks of it, there is no scale of where you are (in the game's progression) versus what bugs come attacking your base. Had two hoards of 10+ larvae come and spawn camp me/destroy my base, one after the other. No room to breathe or progress when you can't even have a place to call home or store what little progress is made in between fending off armies of bugs.
-weird paradox of not being able to sleep because there are threats, yet the more you stay up the more bugs come. 
-I dislike the bugs not having a sense of ""victory"". You'd imagine after killing the player 6+ times in a row and then destroying the base, they'd move on. Yet, seems to me the only way to get the bugs away is to kill them. 
and how am I supposed to kill anything when I constantly feel in a one versus thirty situation with tools that do absolutely no damage. 
$30 for a bug fest both in terms of playability and actual content.

As a 1000hr Ark player, I was slightly skeptical going into that that it would just be Ark with insects instead of dinos. But this is not at all true. Of course some of the key stables that you would expect are in place. Hacking, smashing up or collecting whatever resources you need to craft, build or survive. But this game also includes the true inclusion of story and purpose, and although so far in this early access we only get a micro view of this, I have to say it I was quite excited at where this could go. Of course this is entirely up to Obsidian now, if the story elements don't get fleshed out and added in fully - then this game will likely struggle to make its mark in the sea of survival/crafting games. However if the story elements do really get built and there is a clear and interesting purpose added in, then this game could achieve what Ark never did, not matter how hard Wildcard tried.

Well this is a new experience, and I like it.

I wonder if we will be able to tame and ride some of the insects and bugs somewhere in the hopefully [b][i]near[/i][/b] future [i](Wink-Wink Nudge-Nudge [b]to the Developers[/b]).[/i] I like that there is a type of building aspect adjacent to the combat/survival system in the game, like a mini survival game in a BIG BIG world, and of course the fact that it is co-op... brilliant.

It is quite an experience to be able to live and fight with insects and bugs so up-close and personal [i](like in [b]really[/b] up-close and personal)[/i] that can actually be found in your own backyard, it's kind of creepy =)

To start off with
The graphics are amazing. for an early access game? AMAZING.
Game play was smooth, crafting was a little bit clunky with regards to oversensitive angles on wall placement. 
Theres no ""snap to"" function, just an overly sensitive Q or E (left or right) for angle change. 

Not sure what the horizontal arrow pointing out was about, pertaining to which side faced where, for what purpose? Is it like Rust for example with an internal/external side to the walls? 

Nice touch with different radials for weapons, crafting and building.

Auto save every 3 mins with notification became really annoying. So I turned it on to every 5 then eventually 10 mins.
I am not so sure about the having the QUIT (choice of save) and SUPER QUIT (does the same as quit with the save prompt) surely super quit shouldn't need a save function? makes SUPER QUIT seem a bit redundant tbh

Logged off game and went back on the next day after previously playing 6 hours on stream.
Game was in the autosave files, but every time I loaded the game it crashed.

Verified game through steam  (nothing wrong)
Loaded game crash
Game uninstall, restart and reinstall, create new game, play the tutorials, save. crash
Game open load, no save game, tried to play a bit longer, craft a fire, all materials, placed fire, crash.

Some of them can be game breaking, hence early access so they can get play test data and fix anything wrong with the game. As a coder I get why they did it. I also see people throw around that obsidian is owned by Microsoft and should have the budget without early access. Which is probably true, it is also safe to assume the price of the game will go up as they finish it. So for $30 and some bugs, so far my friends and myself have had a great time playing and exploring the world which is going to be pretty huge once it's finished. So the choice is really up to you $30 now for a work in progress and help the developers work out the kinks or potentially $60 when it's finished. Also, in regards to story, this is Obsidian they know what they are doing in that regard seeing as some of my favorite game stories with actual choices impacting a game have come from this studio.

64,73755048,english,"Overall: (7/10) (For now)

Game-Play:
Very interesting game with seemingly endless ways to improve. The story is currently very short but there are so many ways it could go from here. The open world aspect of the game is fantastic, the map does not feel small at all. The way the mobs interact with the player and each other is interesting and enjoyable.
 
Graphics: 
The graphics are smooth and have a perfect balance between realism and the cartoon look. Some aspects are done better than others. For example the ray tracing is gorgeous. Waking up in the morning actually feels like a morning with the sun just peeking over the grass.  Some of the animations however are not quite as stellar. Specifically the tool animations feel clunky and uncomfortable- especially the shovel. Something about digging with one hand and stabbing the shovel like a spear just doesn't feel right. 

Recommendations:
-It would be nice to see some sort of other life in the future of the game- aside from different insects. Maybe occasionally a dog/cat could walk through the yard, if not to interact with then just for the aesthetic. Lizards/snakes/etc. would be a nice addition as well, the atmosphere feels like there should be life other than bugs.
-There are tons of different locations on the map, but nearly all of them are purely aesthetic. The majority of the locations consist of a single piece of trash that you are often able to enter or climb on top of, but these landmarks serve nothing as far as game-play goes. Being able to interact with these landmarks in a certain way or at least being able to build items on/inside of these things is something I would consider an imperative addition.
-The addition of some sort of sled or cart to transport materials is much needed. To construct decently sized bases costs a ton of materials, some of which are sparsely scattered across the map (specifically Dandelions) and can be extremely tedious to gather only carrying 5 at a time.

Bugs I have encountered:
-The way steam determines if the app is running seems to be bugged. Steam thinks this app is always running- even after force quitting the program steam seems unable to register that it has closed.
-Stuck in spider web even after destroying it. 
-Unable to resurface from underwater.
-Jumping with something blocking above you causes the character to be launched backwards a fair distance. This most frequently happens to me underneath clovers.

I give the game an overall 7/10 for these reasons but remember, this game is still early-access so it could very well be on its way to a 10/10. It has tons of potential.  Needless to say I am excited to see the path the developers choose.",1596553766,1596554013,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True,76561198201963752,32,2,1199,11,812,1601864917

Listen i HATE Survival Crafting games. I haven't been a fan of them sense Minecraft. Everything thats come after it has lacked heart and just seemed like souless cash grabs to me.

So when i say this know its the truth. or at least in my eyes

No survival crafting game has given me such joy and awe and wonder.

I would give this game a !0/!0 if it was a full game and i knew it had all its contents. Id Give it a 10/10 if i thought its reached its peak, and if i thought there was no more potential.  

I Give this a 8/10 Dont let that discourage you. No matter what any of the reviews say i highly recommend you try this. The Graphics are Very nice and have that nice Nintendo Levels of Polish look.

All the sounds are satisfying. its a lot of fun to play its a completely different take on the survival crafting game. I cant give it enough praise.

RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE DEVS
First off let me start by saying i love everything ive seen so far. But i think the game could really benefit from some sort of Pet system or even better a Creature Taming system.

packpack exspansion.

I also am not the biggest fan of the armor sets in the game. The idea behind them is cool. But most of them are just shoulderpads and kneepads IT would be nice to have complete cool looking armor sets that cover the whole body so you cant see the kids clothes.

also i think maybe some sort of character creation system in the far far future would be cool. id like the stuff above this to be focused on more though. Espescially PETS. i want bug friends With armor and upgrades. Mounts. its kinda sounding like ark, But thats okay. i dont like ark but i like this game. And their pet systems are prob the only good thing about their games. so yeh really want some but friends.",1596553946,1596553946,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True,76561198136179642,211,11,331,0,276,1600630398

78,73747856,english,"Well, what to say?

I have been playing these survival builders pretty much for as long as they have existed.

I tend to be forgiving for their shortcomings, they almost always start as early access, and stay that way.

But, beggars can not be chosers, and the availability of AAA titles is limited, if not non existent in this genre.

Hopefully that is about to end!

Does grounded have issues?

For sure, plenty even, there are game braking bugs, annoying bugs, and, well just bugs everywhere, both literally and methaphorically!

It is a game about bugs after all.

But, I soldiered trough it.

Why?

Because this have the potential to be the best of them all.

The setting and premise is imaginative and exciting, to a point were my mind takes this game to places it can never go with todays technology, and barely could with a holo-deck.

I am well aware I am setting myself up for dissapointment, but I just do not care.

Story took me a couple of in game days, ( if that ), I had discvoered mostly everything this version have to offer by day 20.

It is now day 70, and I am still logging in!

Because underneath the buggy, and limited, version we are playing there is a polish we, or at least I, have yet to see in a survival title.

That being said, if you are easily furstrated, new to the genre, or early access games in general?

Perhaps stay away from this one for now.

If you enjoy survival games even a little bit though, or think you might get it later, I encourage you to to do so now, doubt it will get cheaper.

I do not think this will be abandoned in a half finished state, as is often the case.

This is Obsidian, ( allthough I know nothing about the group making this so take that for what it is worth ), they are pretty well known for quality.

And Microsoft, perhaps not known for the same things as Obsidian, but they tend to have perseverence. ( More so then lets say EA or Activision ).

And considering the hype, I very much doubt they are willing to lose face on this one by making it a half-assed product.

Sadly I do think they will keep it a PC/XBOX game though, seeing the popularity and the console makers affinity for ""exclusives"", they will probably milk this for all it is worth.

Also means I am fairly sure there will be DLC's and skin packs and whatnot in a steady stream.

Ambivalent about that, want it to both be true and not be true! ;)

Regardless, I have not had this much in a game in a long time, and I have played mostly solo, in multiplayer it is like crack glazed with sugar on Christina Aguileras behind!

[h1] WAIT FOR CONTENT UPDATE...UNLESS...... [/h1] 

An early-access game, made from a passionate team of 12 developers, from one of the greats Obsidian. The game is beautifully designed with an appeal that grabs you from the start. Spiders, Ladybugs and Stinkbugs seem impossible at first and overwhelming at first, but as you learn and grow, the backyard becomes yours. 

However, the story and a lot of the content of the game is yet to be out. They plan monthly updates, so if you want a more polished, story driven survivor game I'd give it some time. I personally enjoy the state of the game where it is now, I found it fun. Adapting to your new environment, building and discovering secrets and hidden places.

It's brutal but It has so many great mechanics and It has a base building/crafting system similar to The Forest as it allows you to lay out a blueprint for your base so you get a feel for what you're building then you go find the materials needed to complete your structures. The graphics and art style are beautiful, the characters have their own personalities and I can't stress enough how awesome this game is and how it is well worth the 30 bucks It's at even in early access. I have to say, I'm not scared of spiders, but this game might change that because those orb weavers and wolf spiders are nightmare fuel.

Notes:

I love this game to death. It really makes you feel small in your own backyard. I love the survival aspects of this game like being able to farm resources. I can't comment on the story, since It doesn't have one yet. Overall a very enjoyable game, albeit heart-racing at times.

Of course, the game is in early access, so there are some bugs (no pun intended)
Bugs Include:
-Insects getting stuck in objects/falling through the ground
-(one instance) blocking freezing my screen and studdering for a second (scared the sh!t outta me lol)
-An Orb Weaver stuck on bushes, thought it would jump down to eat me (concept?)

Some Critiques:
*Make the stack size bigger than 10. I find myself running out of space a lot whenever I go exploring.
*Let me be able to build on structures! That'd be sick!

Other than that, go buy the game! Is fun!

28,73733085,english,"**Right after I wrote this review and tried to play, it kept crashing as I attempted to load any save. Please factor its very early development into your judgement.**

(TL;DR) It's great if you are super into the theme/idea of the game and willing to support its development with the current price tag, but it can be frustrating otherwise.

I almost didn't buy it because I felt the price was way too high for early access. I still believe that. The reason I did buy it despite my better judgement is because I really want to see a game like this succeed; this is my childhood dream come true. I'm not very picky besides with graphics, and this game has really beautiful ones. Also, I just got my tax returns.

Otherwise, I still would have bought it eventually; but I would have waited a year until it was on sale, and even then the devs say the price will be higher so who knows if that would be below $30. Scare tactics, man.

Besides waiting for new features, here's some problems I've seen in the game:
Some inventory UI glitches
Repair tools not working
Spiders/other big bois being way too hard to kill (easy mode is just for survival stats like hunger)
Big scarcity of weed planks, which could be solved if I could kill bugs easier to get a lvl 2 axe, but even in some places weeds are hard to find. Dang this thorough gardener...

So they're not really game breaking, and likely to be balanced and fleshed out as development continues. As most people are saying, this is basically Alpha gameplay.

I loved building a base on a leaf though, and gliding with dandelion seeds. Made me feel like a fairy. That's really all I wanted from this game, and it works. But if you aren't 100% on board with the idea of the game, I'd say maybe wait until it's more fleshed out.

Edit: You can also make little plushies of the small bugs you kill, and head mounts of big ones. I made a gnat and it hooks onto the ceiling by a string so you can wack it around. Also Aphid slippers that grant you ""The Quickness""

- Arrows sometimes falls/glitches into the ground making them impossible to retrieve. 
- Ants, ladybugs and other insects are sometimes trapped inside rocks.
- I got stuck in a spiderweb, and once cutting the web up; I was unable to move.
- Ants and weevils spawned inside my base walls, destroying all my storage baskets; I have now moved my base on top of a tree stump and have no encountered this at all.

76,73725455,english,"It's just alright. I can't recommend it right now as it's no where finished and doesn't have the content to keep someone entertained in a building/survival game. 

The first issue is balance. Spiders feel spammed across the map and not really properly placed. I mean they can out right rape you and one hit K/O and with no real effective way to fight them without CHEESING the AI is frustrating. The enemies start to repeat heavily.

Next big issue is AI path finding. It's also broken. If you head into the bushes you'll be greeted with 1 million orb weavers and spiderlings where if you are on the ground you're fucked, but if you simply just climp up into the bush branches the AI just lets you shoot them to death as they can't figure it out even with you 10 ft away. The Ants in the nest can't path find worth a damn. They clump up into huge balls and don't bother attacking. (**Also there is no queen, what a freaking massive disappointment there holy shit**)

The next issue is the combat. It feels... fine? But not really on point. Rather clunky. Especially when fighting spiders. As the hit detection just doesn't feel right. Don't try to melee spiders. Just don't.

The amount of weapons is also very limited and they make you feel under powered and not a lot of fun... The most effective weapon against spiders if you can land it would be the Bomb, But it's a thrown weapon with rolling physics... Also the bomb blows up half of the grass to so it creates even more of a mess and things to get in your way while you're trying to fight since you collide with grass stalks. 

The game does look stunning and runs perfectly at least for me. So no issues there.

Had to get that out of the way. It runs surprisingly smooth and the sound design both deserve honorable mentions, but jumpin' jesus on a pogo stick this is visually glorious.

The only real drawbacks are hallmarks of most Early Access titles. Needs more content for sure. In the first 7 hours we've done everything we can quest-wise, and only stopped short of attacking the big spider nest. On the note of spiders, a dodge roll is desperately needed. Map is actually a lot smaller than you think. If you dead sprint from one side to the other, you can make it to the other side in about 3-4 minutes. Again, chalk this up to ""more content"" needed.

My only personal pet PEEVE is the coding of the spiders. They won't fight each other, or hunt other insects. The ants will eat other bugs, the ladybugs will charge and devour aphids. The spiders? They only have a taste for HUMAN FLASH and nothing else will do. This is doubly weird because Wolf Spiders are territorial by nature. But they will gladly team up with three or four other spiders (including Orb Weavers) to corner you in a research shelter.

Even the friggin' Ladybug I got to hit a group of ants started fighting with each other. Spiders need a behavior coding overhaul.

- Very fun base gameplay for them to build on (very important for Early Access)
- Pretty polished gameplay so far!
- This game can be the scariest game in years, those dang spiders! :)
- The AI is fantastic, they have things they must do and they react to whats going on

Stuff that needs improving: 

- Some issues with the coop sometimes
- Random bugs that need to be fixed (but nothing gamebreaking)

Played the demo previously and now the Early Access game, color me impressed! For a game made by 12 people this is fantastic! Playing with a friend is so fun!

Did I mention it is scary as hell!? At night time with the big spiders around, me and my buddy Mathew both screamed like young kids lol

The game has unlimited potential for future content. New Biomes to explore, Adding more Insects/Danger (Snakes! Lawnmower! Dogs!), Charming insects (The devs said they want to add this), more story elements, more stuff to craft and build, (there is already so much to build and craft its crazy!), new weapons,etc.. the game is already amazing, Obsidian has done great ground work for a special game and I cannot wait to see what they come up with next! 

Not a ton of story stuff in the game yet, BUT there is so much more to do like amazing basebuilding (try building somewhere up high and experimenting), exploring the wonderful map,etc..  I have already played 26 hours on the game, solo and with friends and I am still itching to get back on the game.

Keep it up Obsidian!

The building system is cool and will improve with time.
Even if the main story is quite short for now, there is enough of stuff to explore in the backyard to have many hours of fun. 
Obsidian confirmed updates every months starting with  the end of August so that is great news. I am quite happy to see a game developer with a small team that is doing so much for their players.

When you buy this game, keep in mind that this is in early access and the storyline will be developped with time. So don't buy (for now) if you are the type of player to need a story to drive you. The devs put much of their efforts in the world, buiilding system to give player a unique game like this.

I would wait until there is more content and then buy it.


The positive things:

If you want to explore the pretty big world and build a base, you can spend several hours
The game has only a few bugs and is very easy to control.

The negative things:


The game runs at 60 fps even though I have lifted the limit and played it on a top PC with 1080ti and i7-8700k.
The game has very little content so far. If you want to play through the story right from the beginning, you need about 20 minutes. The tutorial is very short and hardly explains how to optain important things and how to find the necessary things. To be able to craft anything at all you have to go with every item into a laboratory and research it there. But you can only research 3 things and then you have to wait 16 minutes.
If you can build something then it is very limited. To build a house you only have a roof, walls and a door. But the whole thing doesn't make sense yet because you are not attacked in the night and you can just sleep and skip the whole night. There is no goal to work towards. You have to eat and drink every 5 minutes or you will starve or die of thirst. Finding something to drink is not the problem, but finding food is very difficult. The fighting system is bad and pointless, the only really dangerous enemies are spiders which are almost impossible to fight alone.

XBL is free on Windows and always has been. You don't need XBL Gold to play online on Windows.

If you already have a Microsoft account, you just need to make an XBL user name. If you have Outlook, Onedrive, or Office, you already have a Microsoft account.

Obsidian is owned my Microsoft and the game is published by Microsoft. Of course it uses XBL, and complaining about it is like asking ActiBlizz, EA, and Ubisoft to get rid of Battle.net, Uplay, and Origin. It's not going to happen.

If you buy and play games through Steam for any of them, you still have to log in to their respective online services for MP. XBL is no different.

The same could be said of the many, many other games that require an account login, like say, pretty much any major MMO, Elite Dangerous, or whatever else requires a game specific login.

The game is decent for what it is, and is a perfectly fine Early Access survival game with an interesting premise. It's clearly unfinished and not balanced well, but it's early access and that's what early access is for fixing.

The building aspect is very creative and done in a way I haven't seen before and it's pretty awesome. The company behind this game is also very dependable and great at what they do. And it's only 30 dollars? Sounds pretty awesome right?

Well here's the problem. The game is so buggy, it outnumbers the amount of bugs in the game. I won't go into detail here but it crashes. Once an hour at minimum. The game is as stable as those grass huts you make. It's almost unplayable at the moment. 

I posted a full review on my youtube channel if you want a more in depth look at the game and its pro's and cons. (Link below). 

But honestly this game has some serious potential to one day become awesome. Needless to say it's a great investment. Becuase as soon as the devs fix its bugs this game is gonna become legendary. I mean...even if you have a FEAR of spiders this game gives you an arachnaphobia mode so the spiders just look like colored orbs but their gameplay remains unaffected. It's pretty awesome for someone like me whose terrified of spiders, now even I can play this game.

80,73713155,english,"I have put enough hours into this game, I think, to give my 2 cents. 
Tl;Dr: Good game with lots of potential. Lot's of bugs (the bad kind) however.

Gameplay: Grounded has a very cool concept. Basically Honey I Shrunk The Kids the game. The survival mechanics are what you'd expect, just with the twist of being tiny. Water is dew drops, food is bug meat and shrooms, etc. 

Characters: The characters are young teenagers and, while the voice acting is fine, I had to turn down the dialogue volume to 0% due to the repetitive voice lines. Being anywhere near ants causes the characters to machine gun out the same stupid line of ""Oh hey look an ant"" over and over and over. 

Spiders: A lot of people complain about spiders being ""op"" and, at first, I was inclined to agree. However, once you learn to fight, especially when it comes to using the perfect block, they quickly lose most of their terror factor. My only remaining complaint regarding spiders, specifically the wolf spider, is that their attack hitbox is obscenely generous in their favor. I died several times to wolf spiders (albeit while still learning to block) due to them being able to attack from a distance despite clearly doing a melee attack. 

Bugs: Bugs often get stuck in walls or stuck on each other, the ai is super easy to exploit, ants can rob your chests even if the chest is inches (several meters by comparison) off the ground. 

Overall I would say wait if you don't want to deal with bugs and frustration over the lack of polish to mechanics.

My wife and I were looking for a Coop game that moments of ""chill"" and ""stress."" We have played quite a few survival builders and what sets this a part for us is a few things. (My experience is primarily based on 5-8 hours of initial play).

The Good:
- The world is ""relatable."" Obviously this is due to the ant size backyard appeal. This makes the exploration a real treat and families young and old can get behind it.
- It has quests compared to other survival builders. This is great because for myself I like directed goals to complete, rather than just being left to my own ideas to keep me interested.
- Simplistic. The crafting system shows you what you need and not only that, you are able to set out ""pre-builds"" of what you want to do. Then you can estimate how many materials you need! It also has an easy tutorial to follow in the beginning. Note: Be careful on going dave the barbarian on ants in the beginning ;) you have been warned! lol.
- Combat system isn't ""dull,"" and is pretty straight forward. Nothing too hardcore.
- I'm sure I have other things to note but this is just my initial review lol.

Improvements (hope Devs see this):
- When depositing in a storage container, it looks like there isn't a ""deposit all stacks"" of one item. You have to deposit one at a time. (please correct me if I'm wrong)
- Armor equipped takes up bag space. It would be understandable if you weren't wearing the item, but it doesn't make sense to me that it takes up bag space when you are wearing the item?
- Minor: Could we get a quick-turn-around function? If this exists and I'm unaware please let me know.
- Could we get a ""loot all"" in a small vicinity? Sometimes items roll after killing, and it would be great if there was a faster loot option.
- More graphics alterations/editing would be cool.

98,73439845,english,"The game works.  There is nothing to do.  After about one hour's worth of story, you just run around and get killed by spiders.  There is very little content here, save your money until it's further along in development.

If you are the type of player that needs the game to give you something to do, pass on this.  Right now, it's just a sandbox.

It's a console port, so if terrible console controls frustrate you as a PC player, this will annoy you.

There are plenty of issues with the EA build.  The UI is particularly frustrating.  The armor that you wear is still in your backpack, which is very tiny.  Repairing items is usually harder than crafting the same item again, until you figure out quartzite.  There are several things that will cause a CTD, like interacting with the spit when it has items already cooked on it and many other things.

There is always a delicate balance in a survival game between challenging and really annoying.  Right now, it's super annoying to have to constantly eat and drink so often.  Food will also spoil faster than you can eat it.  Much faster.  You can craft a jerky rack to dry out meat that won't spoil, but until then the early game is a real pain.  There needs to be a much better transition between tiers so it isn't so punishing for new players.  There is no fun in getting one-shot by spiders and constantly dying of hunger and thirst!

It almost feels like the early game is tuned for a group of 4 working closely together, and when you tech up to the next tier you are finally strong enough to combat the bigger bugs and spiders solo.

Everything I mentioned until now can be changed and improved.  Unfortunately what I see as the biggest issue for this game is the static hand crafted map.  Re-playability is going to be very low.  It's only fun and interesting to discover the back yard once.  Even the resources spawn in the same place, so you find yourself just running in a circuit collecting things where you know they are.  In 2020 procedurally generated maps is a must have for mature players that want to play more than 10 hours for a full price game.

Lastly, some are comparing this to ARK.  It's only similiar in some of the lower level survival concepts.  In terms of the amount of content in ARK compared to Grounded, it's apples and oranges.  ARK's map, tech tree, mob variety, gear tiers, etc. is about 100x more rich.  It would take Grounded a decade to catch up to that.  Anyone that says ""it's like ARK"" must not have ever played ARK for longer than a day.

Players tolerance for these things will be low at the very high price tag of this EA game.  At this stage in development, it would be fair to charge about $4.99.

PRO TIPS:

For players that want the challenge, and like survival in a sandbox here are a few tips:

Get a 3 piece acorn set (super easy), and beat a few soldier ants to death.  Then make the ant club, and beat a few spiders to death.  Now you have the spider bow, and you can kill a bunch more spiders for the spider set.  With this, you can solo everything, and go collect the other tier 2 resources you want to base build and gather science from the quests.

Plant fiber and sap are literally everywhere, and they make a bandage that is a HoT (heal over time).  You should have 10 of these on your hotbar at all times, and a hotkey to use.",1595980925,1596474818,False,2,0,0.5,0,True,False,True,76561197993371565,53,11,1131,0,237,1596908233

Other than that its an amazing and vibrant fun experience. I have alot more to learn about the game so ill keep at it and see what happens.......",1596463990,1596463990,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True,76561198970448599,8,2,1870,91,365,1600969941

As soon as I got in to the playable game I was just awestruck by how beautiful it is and how polished the completed sections of the yard are. The atmosphere is incredible. I just explored and explored. I played single player, so I can't comment on the Multiplayer issues.

66,73691935,english,"I've played this game for a few days now, and my experience has been that this is definitely a fun and refreshing take on the other survival and base building games out there. I never saw any advertisement for this and just stumbled upon it myself, though it's fairly new I would have expected to hear about it earlier, with it being such a visually attractive and interesting themed game.

 There are still some bugs (Ha!) but nothing that is game breaking by any means, a little annoying when they first happen but they can be worked around. The main ones I've dealt with have been the game crashing a lot the first day I played, once or twice an hour but the autosave feature was a big relief when that happened. Sometimes while crafting several of something, the crafting window will not update showing the quantity you currently have and just starts dropping the new ones all over the ground around you. Other than those, it has been doing wonderfully. 

I love base building games and it's fun to run around slicing down blades of grass and watching ladybugs go into a blind frenzy when you knock down an aphid. The little noises the insects make are sometimes adorable, sometimes startling, I would love to see more of a variety of insects added later on.

 I am still figuring things out and learning from mistakes, but the lack of permadeath and the autosave feature make your failures more easily forgivable. A couple suggestions I have so far, some way to preserve food would he a huge help instead of having meat rot after one day, a spoilage timer would be great. Equipped armor shouldn't continue to take up bag space, it's an odd thing to see that happening and that bit does seem unnecessary. Maybe I haven't discovered how to make it yet, but some way to catch water other than collecting droplets or sipping from puddles would be awesome! I love hopping on the backs of the lady bugs and letting them wander around like I'm taking a ride, have you considered making an actual taming or riding system for any of the insects? Maybe a fishing pole with a little aphid dangling off to lure your Ladybug steed to your destination?

 Overall I'm enjoying the game and I would suggest any survival fans to check it out! It might also be a nice introduction for older children interested in the genre as it's not as intense as some of the other popular ones. There's also an arachnophobia adjusting slider in the options to make the spiders look less scary if that's something that puts you off of trying it out.

While currently lacking in the story content, they've setup an interesting world and it's definitely one i kept exploring.

The Base Building is incredible for such an early build of the game, it was interesting because of it's scale harder materials were numerous in other areas, and at times i really felt like an ant, moving across the map, which for being entirely localised in a backyard, does still provide areas to explore and i haven't even seen everything the map has yet.

I would say that Grounded is worth getting and giving it a try, 
While there are bugs and well Bugs it is still a game that i can boot up when i want to relax and just build, and when the story content gets fleshed out and we have some different areas to explore i'd be up to play this game for hours.

The Fact the game has multiplayer means that it's got a one up on other survival games like Subnautica (which i also adore) because it allows players to come together to explore, survive and face threats.

 so far my only only gripes about it is the lack of dropping items in stacks, getting ganked by spiders everywhere (no place feels safe enough to setup a base without getting a spider to show up and wreck everything), and arrows randomly getting massive and not being able to pick them up because they register as being in the ground. the only other issue I have with the game is something I know technically goes against the story and may even mess up the balancing of the game, but if they were to just set up a way of allowing it be up to either 5 or 6 players would be awesome ( I play with a large group). even if its by just allowing multiple people to play the same character.

Overall, it has many of the survival game elements! The theme of being small and fighting bugs is really cool, and it's exciting to see where they take the game. Many new creatures to possibly encounter, and what if it expands into the house!? Who doesn't want to slay cock roaches and giant rats?!

93,73684958,english,"Probably going to draw quite a bit of flak for this ""not recommended"" review but hear me out.. 

Scores (at its current state):
Atmosphere: 9/10
Graphics: 9/10
Content: 3/10
Replayability: 2/10

The good:
Concept is unique and one that surprisingly hasn't been explored by any dev so far despite its obvious entertainment value (Honey I Shrunk The Kids meets ever-increasingly popular gaming genre of survival). Realistically brutal, as it would be in a bug's life (in this case yours, in their size). The lack of handholding pushes the player to think on their feet, which fits well into the mystery of this situation you are thrown into (unnecessary handholding would've taken away from immersion otherwise).

The bad:
The release of this game at this price point is a little unjustified. Survival games that had an early access (for e.g. The Long Dark) usually come with a decently fleshed out sandbox with the promise of an eventual story, or a decently fleshed out story with a promise of an eventual sandbox. In grounded, we have little of either. The story comes to a very quick end as it is still being created (perfectly understandable). However, there is not much content in the sandbox department as the ceiling of craftables are quite quickly reached (which the exception of tier 2 tools). With a very familiar and simple trope of only having to manage hunger and thirst, there is little to do in the sandbox other than basic base building. Most survival games so far (even on early access release) have had decent enough distractions for your character to manage (Cold, Thirst, Hunger, Fatigue in The Long Dark) or endless base building possibilities (Minecraft). 

Many would argue that this is still early access, and there's much more to come. I agree, and I would expect no less from a dedicated dev like Obsidian. However, this release should've been either:

(1) A larger story on release at this current price
(2) A better sandbox on release at this current price
(3) Based on the current content, at half its price

Wow another early access survival game, aren't there enough of those already? Well at least that is what I thought before playing this game. At the request of a friend I begrudgingly purchased this title. I also really like Obsidian and don't mind supporting them but I have to stress I am really weary of early access releases.


For an early access title there is a surprising amount of content, it is much more polished than most of the 'early access' titles that are on the market. In fact many games that are early access take years to get to where the current state of this game is and would declare the title a full release.

 The game is pleasantly unique for the fact that the premise is instead of your normal zombies, being marooned on an island, or the end of the world, you get shrunk down to comical proportions. You chose from 1 of 4 kids to play as and you have to some how manage to survive in your new horrific predicament. A different spin on the survival crafting genre of games. 

 The art style is very whimsical, initially giving me the impression that this was going to be a casual kids game. The moment I ran into a Wolf Spider I realized this is very much not the case. I have to really stress that the art style of the game is a breath of fresh air, this isn't a reskin of DayZ, or a voxel Minecraft survival clone, this is it's own unique thing.

Grounded being a survival game is similar to titles such as The Forest, Ark, and Subnautica. The crafting system is nothing special, gather the right resources build the things. However what I like is that the game isn't as much of a grind, building your base and crafting resources does not take a ridiculous amount of time and energy. Collect the parts, analyze them, build cool stuff. 

Combat in it's current state is pretty unforgiving and you will find yourself using strategy more often than brute forcing your way through the environment. I am playing with one other person and even dealing with lower enemies is sort of a hassle. That said, if you die (you will a bunch) the game doesn't punish you. All of your belongings will drop where you died so you can go and collect your things and not lose any progress. (I personally really like this).

Currently the selection of insects/animals in the environment is pretty small. Then again for early access it is a decent amount and I have been having a pretty good time. I am really looking forward to the future updates and what new critters they will add.

Unfortunately if you are looking for a rich story driven game, that is simply not there at this time. To Obsidians credit they are very forthcoming with that fact so I wasn't blind sided by the currently shallow story (they are working on it).

As for performance, this game runs really well on my system. I have not experienced lag or many bugs for that matter. Occasionally insects will clip through the environment making them impossible to get to.

Another thing I noticed is that objects in Grounded are persistent, meaning what ever you drop, or what ever things the world generates remains in the world. I currently have not ran into any issues with this but I have the creeping suspicion that eventually this will become a major problem in more mature games.

Overall if you enjoyed titles like Subnautica and Ark I am confident you will like this game. It is very fun in single or multiplayer. If you want a story hold off on this title. If you are looking for a survival game to play with friends that doesn't involve zombies I would highly recommend this game.",1596422939,1596425027,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True,76561198036958326,129,1,2339,0,1404,1596839220

1. Too Many spiders that can one shot you
2. The fighting mechanic is laggy and enemies teleport to you when they are about to attack which makes you not want to fight any strong enemies 
3. Items fall through ground and you will not be able to retrive them
4. arrows that are on the ground will not get picked on first click sometimes you have to click multiple times for them to be picked up which can be anoying while fighting an enemy 
5. When you use the bow the arrow that's already in the bow stay in the bow and does't move which will obstruct you vision while aiming.
6. Multiplayer games are very laggy
7. your vision is very blurry when you try to look in to distance, for example when you go on top on leaf or a high point you can't look at anything because the focus system is not adjusted 
8. There are no instruction in the games that can guide you

This is based upon my experience on both units. Visually this is just stunning. Seriously just stunning. I do have to say that i experience something like a splash/ multi-color blur effect  on the edges of my screen (but this only occurred on the console not the PC version). That has seemed to have been corrected as of me writing this - been playing since day 1.

Sound is now good but upon initial launch it was a bit off at certain areas of the game - entering the Oak tree  or speaking with BURGL. I've noticed that the support has been very good with corrections so far.

Controls are good on the console but I had to get this on the PC because for me I had to ""feel"" what it was like to run through the grass; as it's seems to me the WASD input method is far superior, when compared to a console controller. This game ""feels"" good on a console but WOW on a PC. From building, to combat and exploration this is good.  

Not going to make this too long as I am going back into this game to find out what I can discover - REALLY looking forward to how they flesh this out.

Issues I noticed was getting DCd a lot when connecting with my friends game. I have Fiber so I know my internet speed is not the issue and his wifi is at the highest. I play several online and rarely have connection issues. But during our 8.9 hours of play I got DCd from his game about 15 times.

Bugs in the game besides the actual ones were items that said E for collecting that would not work. I ran into some bubbles of juice forming below the juice box near the tree and for some odd reason one of my backpacks spawned out of it, several tapes, 2 granola bars and some stones. Backpack had my name on it, with the E symbol which would mean you could interact with it, but still could not. It was as if it spawned one of my backpacks I lost from a death in that spot and it made me lose a decent amount of tools and items because where the backpack was before, disappeared from the map after that. Spiders glitching into areas, like the science building hallway that is under one side of the tree. Spiders being able to hit you through landscape items that should otherwise keep them from hurting you. Ants and random other bugs glitching into large stones. We built on one of the large flat stones near the largest body of water on the map and an ant ended up stuck under that large stone. We ended up attacking another ant that was trying to get into a storage chest on the edge of our foundation, that we were trying to build walls around but hadnt gotten all the materials, and the one stuck in the rock, was able to hit us through the rock and through our clay foundation. Was a big pain but we put down a few spoiled meat around the edge of the large stone and got his head partially out enough to hit him a few times and kill him, but again a big pain.

 I also have the experience that the more people are joining the Game the more it’s getting laggy ( idk if anybody else have the same problem).



Pros: 
-Very Beautiful graphic and music/soundtrack
-Nice atmosphere
-Unique Gamedesign


Neutral (Idears for the Future):
-Equipment like Armor is still in the inventory when equiped (takes inventory space)
-More Story content pls 
-balance creature spawning
and much more...

Cons:
-Randomly Wolf Spiders spawning in the starting Area (Idk why don´t ask me)
-Items randomly disspawn in your inventory?!
-Spiders can bug through doors, walls and roofs ????
-The Poison is sometimes invisible (still dont know why)
-Items can´t be picked even if they are in the task bar 
-The Price is a bit too high atm you should wait for a discount

68,73664791,english,"Short and Skinny review

Still in development but has a basic and unique twist to the survival genre. Make sure to use the auto save feature as saves do corrupt occasionally. If you are afraid of spiders there is a mode to change them out to something stranger looking and less spider like. If you are a fan of the genre or honey i shrunk the kids you will probably like it. If you want a lot of content I suggest waiting until they have done more. Over all I suggest the game, its quirky and fun. $30 dollars is a good price point but I feel it should have been closer to $20 at this stage of the game.

The Full review

I decided to pick this game up due to it being a survival game and I like the movie honey I shrunk the kids. It's been combined into a unique experience that has tons of bugs, pun intended. Seriously though there are a ton of programming bugs and some can be frustrating especially for new players. If you are not a fan of spiders, the game does have separate mode to disable them. If you are color blind the game does come a colorblind mode however it is still a work in progress. Future updates will also include language translations. A feature I have come to love in Grounded is the auto save. It is set by default to save every 5 minutes and up to 3 auto saves. It can be turned up higher or lower 5 minutes intervals to 20 minute intervals. The auto save slots you'll use go from 0 to 5. This feature can save some frustration which I will address in my not favorable section further below.

The game itself is still in development but the shell of what we currently have seem to be good building blocks for future updates. The graphics for the game are good, it to me captures exactly what the devs are going after. The textures and details of the grass, ground, caves and objects sitting on the map are all well done.   Small normal everyday items like mint container, soda can, juice box are all now gigantic points of interest with different uses. Thee mint container can be opened and mints harvested. You even have the chance to run into a giant hot dog that you can cut up and eat.

The crafting and gathering of items is a lot like other survival games where it can be a grind but as you go things get easier. To be able to craft some items you'll need to analyze items using a research center. Once an item is analyzed you may unlock something like the insect bow or bandages. In a multiplayer game things analyzed are shared with all players. You'll have to fight some bugs several times in order for them to drop parts so if RN-jesus is not being kind to you it may take a bit of time to get what you need.  Another neat mechanic they have is that you will find water droplets on blades of grass and knock them down by throwing a rock.  Just know you're going to end up eating bug a bug at some point as you play the game.  

The Insects and arachnids  are interesting to say the l east. There are several passive mobs that are good for food like aphids, weevils and grubs. Then you the neutral mobs such as worker ants and lady bugs, you leave them alone they leave you alone. Then you have your aggressive mobs which range from gnats to spiders. The gnats do no damage but much like in real life they are just there as irritants, but they also drop meat to cook and eat. There are mites that will attack you but can be handled with bare fists. Other aggressive mobs include infected weevils, and mites.  There are also stinkbugs, larva, soldier ants bombardier beetles and the dreaded spiders. There are also neat mechanics such as an aphid running up a blade of grass to avoid being attacked or ants raiding your base because you have food stored.

Base building is pretty simple with the pieces snapping to each other. Some places cannot be built upon which can hinder you so make sure you check the area as some places that look like you could place something down will not allow you. The building can be fun and is about the same as any other survival genre there is just with a unique spin. You'll need grass plants of weed stems as your main items for building.  There are side quests that will allow you earn science to trade in for plans for other building options such as sturdy walls or a floor. 

Multiplayer is also a fun way to play. You can have up to 3 others join your game and play. Take note a Microsoft account is needed to play online. Once your friends are in you can enjoy teaming up as a group or even splitting off from the group. 

The story of the game is largely unfinished and could be completed in less than 30 minutes if you just focus on it. This is still a work in progress so I do not hold this against them.  Once you complete the main quest then there are the side quests that unlock. These vary from analyzing quest, fetch quest, location marking or even killing certain amount of bugs.

Now we went through the good, leaving us only with only the less than favorable aspects of the game. 

Less Than Favorable

Now above I mentioned the great feature of auto saving. I will tell you now to use it as several of these issues below can be fixed by save scumming.

Now know I suggest auto saves for a couple reasons. I at first was not saving as when you go to exit the game will create and exit auto save. Regular saving is something I suggest doing regularly before you exit the game. My first play through auto exit save was corrupted and would not load. I was able to use an auto save from earlier to recover. Now the save game issue here can happen on a normal save as well. Again the more saves/auto saves the better for this early stage game.

Right off the bat on of the most frustrating things are the worker ants. IF they feel you have too much food they will attack your base and start pulling things out of your chests. This is a unique feature that i enjoy but what makes it bad is the fact the ant's reach is seemingly unlimited as they could reach up and take things out of a chest 6 stories up.


Another point of frustration is that there is a chance for items when in chest and being moved to glitch and change to something else. I had spider silk turn into ant heads and grub hide turn into gnat fuzz. A friend playing with me even had his screen show spider silk but on mine something else. Save scumming and going back to my save 5 minutes prior allowed us to recover the proper items.

Players may also randomly get kicked and I have seen it go 1 of 2 ways when a player rejoins. First they come back with all their gear on and all of their inventory. The second way is after reconnecting they come back with nothing, no gear, no inventory as if they were a fresh player. Save scumming at that point will allow them to recover anything which may be more beneficial than just making everything over again.",1596389837,1596389837,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True,76561198035652182,319,1,4743,0,2482,1599861204

I would like to add features id enjoy seeing here;
-Rideable bugs e.g. Ladybugs (Onwards battle bug!!)
-More explanation for new players on what parts of the map are useful (In the form on character dialogue maybe?)

73,73663930,english,"I just felt the need to finally write my first review, guess why? I don't stand those bad reviews. 10hrs on early access seems fair enough to me as most ppl 've only played it for barely 2 hrs, to review and refund it. Seriously folks?

A RL friend of mine and I decided to buy this game right after release, and boy oh boy. 

Even though the game only has a very small amount of story (max 1hr), we ended up exploring the garden and uncovering different biomes. Doing so gave me chills and loads of goosebumps. I mean my stream viewing mates were laughing so hard at the multiple bug encounters we had, that at a certain time even I couldn't hold it back. Didn't know any more whether I should laugh or shit my pants encountering those nasty spiders. When it comes to base building, you'll soon realise that your housing location is of importance. The building system itself seems quite nice although, you'll most likely experience some major bugs, which didn't take away the fun but made us solve the issue in a creative way.

Now after spending 2 evenings in ""Grounded"", I've decided to go back outside into our lovely garden. Man, I don't know what happened but when I'm playing games with my kids in the garden I check on everything, hahahah. Like: 

""Woaaaaahhhh, there's an ant, lets follow it""
""What might have created this hole?""
...

I wish you'd see the look of my eldest when doing so.

I didn't like spiders before the game, now I just check every corner in our house and my wife kinda likes the game too, she keeps telling me to play some more, apparently the house never looked as clean as of now!",1596388439,1596388439,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True,76561198024606632,113,1,676,0,575,1596484026

9,73609537,english,"First let me start off by saying I love this game =) its great and a lot of fun. As someone who is definitely terrified of spiders I am appreciative of the arachnophobic option. Thank you to the devs that implemented it. I in all truth havent turned it on, because I want to experience the game as it was intended... -.- Terrifying as they are lol. Every time I am running the hairs on the back of my neck stand up ( not even kidding )

Anyway, back to the game.. I love the artwork... Its incredible, Yes its a cross between Honey I shrunk the kids, and your building/survival game. Currently I have spent 22 Hours in this game and yes, there are bugs but in the same token this is Early Access and I can see those issues addressed before launch. I love that in the morning you can look up through the blades of grass and find dew drops to drink as ""clean water"" lol because the mucky puddles make you ill and hungry ( for a short time ). The nights are disgustingly dark lol and you cant see not an inch in front of your face. 

You are forced to think on your feet... Before you venture out, have the supplies you would need to get far from your base to explore and find certain items. I appreciate the torches and ""never leave home without one"" lol, just in case! 

Combat: Combat seems okay imo? You can block, you can also use a bow and shoot from relatively far. However be prepared to be stunned by some bugs, poisoned by others, and damn those spiders they are SUPER fast. If you are playing alone they present a challenge for sure. But I find that in the game where I am playing with a friend they are more manageable. Teaming up against a ladybug seems oh so wrong, but it becomes easier. You can also acquire weapons that stun them in turn, they help A LOT. 

Food: There is food everywhere.. my favorite has to be acorns. You can utilize the whole acorn, the tops, shells and meat from inside. Aphids are one of the first critters you encounter, their meat is great to cook fills you right up =) they are simple to kill, if they climb up a blade of grass, whack it and they will fall to their death lol. There are many things you can ""cook"" to feed yourself along with a plethora of mushrooms all over the map. 



Here are some of the things that currently are what I feel needs looking at =) 


Voice chat is not working properly, settings I have PTT on and its always on, I check the never option and its still ON lol. You have to toggle it for it to read the setting per se. 

Analyze menu escape doesnt close it ( a few menus do not close when hitting escape or space as instructed ) 

Items disappear at times when putting them in storage, or pulling them out of storage, putting items to cook. 

Maybe not have ""gear"" that we wear take up space in the inventory? Or maybe add in a backpack of sorts for it and the tools?

Also I dont know if this is possible, however it absolutely drives me bonkers that once the game settings are set as we want them.. The volume of the main start up screens are ear splittingly loud -.- If this could be a thing? Where whatever volume the game itself is set at, it carries over to everything in the game? Especially the start up screen  ( you would have my eternal thanks heh )

Edit: for the first time yesterday I kept crashing, only when recycling though. ( might be an issue here ) 

Also, another suggestion... I think its sort of unfair that when you play multiplayer, the other ""non host"" people dont get a save of their own. We were playing the other day and my friend died, but I was stuck in a web, so I had to restart the game ( the web had been broken btw, I was just kinda hanging there in mid air lol ) and he lost all his stuff =(

This brings me to my next bug, seems that even if you chop down a spider web, you still stay stuck there regardless of how long you wait etc. Only a relog will help free you. 

Another thing we were speaking about, is maybe if it were possible to make multiple of certain items? Like the fibers and such? 

One last idea I had, because its driving me mad that there grass cuttings EVERYWHERE around my base lol. Would it be possible to maybe make a compost bin of sorts? Was thinking that it could maybe be like the grass pallet, but we could put grass/weeds there to eventually delete and maybe become a dirt, or fertilizer... or even a clay? That once a day it would empty and maybe give something in return =) hell, lol tbh I would be happy that it just trash those items once a day with no reward hehe

Will update as we go along, or after final copy is out.. But for now IMO a definite must pick up =) Even with the small inconveniences its still a fun game!",1596291435,1596380820,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True,76561198034217728,1024,35,2038,68,1378,1601522968

Pros-
1. Multiplayer with friends
2. Fun and creative idea to survival games
3. Story line 
4. Good controls and mechanics with in the game

Cons-
1. Online multiplayer with randoms is not out
2. Short story line at the moment (but the are adding more to the game).
3. Many bugs with in the game do exist, none are really game breaking though
4. Bugs sometimes spawn in giant groups

Overall I would recommend this game to friends and other people its genuinely one of the most fun games I have had in a very long time. The game will be a master piece too I think when they finish the story line and fix up some of the bugs. Love the game!

16,73651981,english,"Grounded is a survival game with a brilliant game concept and a lot of potential!

I have already spent some time in Grounded and would like to share a couple of ideas in order to improve the game: 

Inventory - The size of the basic inventory is too small.
Especially considering, that your Armor, and other equiped items also takes up space in the inventory. There should definitely be a Tier 2 Backpack.
The player should also be able to drag and drop 10x stacks of items from their inventory to a chest/basket. 

Bow and Arrow - Especially early in the game the Bow will be the weapon of choice against bigger and stronger enemies. Maybe add a Quiver so the Player won't have to carry about 40-50 arrows with him all the time, because that's about the amount of arrows it takes to kill a Ladybug. Please buff the bow! 

Food - Raw meat spoils too fast! If you leave your base in the morning and go for an adventure, the meat you hunted earlier that day will be spoiled when you get back to the base.  

Base building - This one is kind of obvious, building something can be quite frustrating. Please improve! 

Reviving Teammates - Takes up to 5 tries, in order to work. 
30 secs isn't enough time to revive a teammate. Also concidering, that enemies tend to patrol their prey for a long period of time after they killed them. 


Things that could be added later on:
At some point the Grounded world will have to increase it's size. 
So either create more and deeper Dungeons/Ant nests, or take it into the house. 
Maybe create a world inside the tree, add a water world. (Add a Swimming suit, diving bootle)

Ants that can be tamed with food, and then be used as mode of transportation, like a horse with armor and a saddle. 
Or use the same principle on a butterfly, that can get you up to the treetop of the acorn tree.

Using new material found in the lasers or the lab to create some form of a advanced weapon.


Problems I have faced whilst playing Grounded:
- Enemies health randomly recharging during combat. 
- Spiders bugging through Defensive Walls.
- Groups of Larvaes and Ants spawning inside the base.
- Water drops dissappearing after hitting the grass they where clinging on.
- Swimming mechanics feel kind of odd.
- Only about 50 FPS when playing Grounded, even though I have a strong hardware and my CPU and GPU drivers are up to date. Haven't quite found the root of this problem. 
Maybe it lies within my Hardware/Software or in the game.",1596370015,1596379208,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,1,True,False,True,76561198193555310,46,1,1843,41,841,1601240631
17,73649637,english,"So I feel I've pretty much done all available content in the game at the moment. In my 22 hours, I've built a decent sized base, crafted T2 weapons and armour and killed a few of everything except the Wolf spider.

The game is beautifully presented. I didn't see any graphics glitches. I'm a fan of stylised art anyway, but they've done a terrific job of every aspect; mobs, landscape, resources and buidlings. The only glitches I noticed in the game were mobs spawning in stuff occasionally, and the fact that the Unload action (used for dropping planks and stems) is hardcoded to G and cannot be changed. It's a really smooth package already.

The available story is very limited at the moment, clearly lots still to come. The game does a reasonable job of intro and guiding you through the basics, but you're left to wander and explore on your own fairly quickly. That suited me, and the exploration has been fun. There is no minimap and compass on the HUD, although you can see the direction you're facing and key features on the main map. This creates a terrific sense of being lost, without actually ever becoming completely lost (because you can check the map). I hope they keep this, as it makes the world seem bigger than it is.

The combat is relatively simple. You have block and hit. Combat is a balance of strafing and/or blocking to avoid attacks and striking the mob while managing your stamina bar (running and striking use stamina). I feel the game could use a dodge, but that might make combat too easy. Still, it took me a while to master the combat, and even with a T2 armour set, I'll sometimes kill an Orb Weaver cleanly, and sometimes drop to less than 1/2 health in a fight. Combat definitely generates a sense of peril!

I'm very much looking forward to the updates as they get released.

Is it worth buying now? IMO, if you're looking for something new to play, then yes. If you're anything like me, you'll get at least 10-20 hours in its current form just learning it. I expect there will be a lot of updates before it's 'released', so there's clearly loads of content to come. Very much worth it in my opinion, but everyone has a different sized games budget, so YMMV.",1596365788,1596378188,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True,76561198273980484,23,6,1835,1,1327,1601821238

32,73653985,english,"This game might be the next Subnatica when it comes to survival-crafting games, only more stable and less glitches. Lots bugs though, just not ones related to computers. And an aracnhophobia mode? Even if I'm fine with it I know a friend who hates spiders, and a mode like that is great when you want to focus on everything else. 

The charm is mostly in the perspective, othewise it's very sumilar to other survival-crafting games when it comes to the moment-to-moment gameplay loop. Surprisingly stable for an early access game, more stable than a lot of AAA games at least. 

It is lacking in content, like only the central part of the world is finished and mostly polished, the story is barely there (arguably the best part about Subnautica was the inclusion of an actual story), the enemy vareity feels a little lacking etc. However. In time, as long as the developers doesn't just abandon ship, this game will be a gem among the garbage that steam spews out. 

Maybe not buy it now if old school gameplay and a fresh perspective is not enough for your entertainment but this is definitively worth a follow and adding it to your wishlist if you like survival-crafting games in general.

42,73530033,english,"I am not a game reviewer, simply a player.

Grounded is compatible only to The Forest and Green hell it shows yet again that not all survival games are alike. It directly takes unique elements from The Forest such as its building, progression, and exploration but with better (yet goofier) graphics. It also has some elements from Green Hell.

Even with the cartoon graphics, it’s terrifying to run into a nasty beetle or giant spider. So it still has strong horror elements despite the youthful feel. It seems like the best game to get your kids into the survival horror genre, which I think is genuinely fantastic. It follows Minecraft in that.

The game has a lot of new features, like all good games should. Researching crafting materials unlocks more content. You’re limited to only three items per day per computer, but there are many computers and many days to play.

I’ve only played it for 6 hours, and it’s still in early access with many frustrating bugs, some of which just kill you. It’s clear it’s not finished, but it’s the most polished early access game I have ever played. The animations are smooth, the combat is fluid and it just feels amazing to play.

It’s such a pity it’s only four players, though I’m so grateful it’s multiplayer at all. This would be so much more fun with a bunch of friends all screaming and running from spiders together.

I always hate it when games don’t let you create your own character or least customise them. But at least this game has male, female and different races. It’s nice to play a Forest like game where I am a female for the first time. I wish I didn’t have to play a child, but I understand the homage and the young theme and I think it’s one of the game’s biggest strengths.

I expect to play it for many hours, and expect to pick it up again each time new content comes out. It’s fantastic already, with a lot of content but still need more. I am most excited to see it have more content than it’s only two comparable games, which are both now complete but still lack content.",1596140041,1596370632,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True,76561198009598634,374,6,860,0,402,1596219827

59,73646906,english,"Having first seen the game and its unique concept a few months before their early access release, I had no other choice than to get it. After playing this game for a good amount of hours, I can look back and safely say that it was indeed a fun experience. Both the singleplayer and multiplayer of this game were equally great, though I still highly recommend getting at least up to 3 players on your first run. With singleplayer, it's a horror survival game, yet, with multiplayer, it's still a horror survival but comedy included! The game looks really nice even with the lowest settings as well as the immersive experience to complement it. However, I never said this game was flawless. I'm going to be listing them so that they can be acknowledged, but I can say for certain that this game has a vast amount of potential that it can achieve as well as how much it can fix. Me and my friends, in the hours we have played, have encountered quite a deal of problems during our playtime. Firstly, a lot of disconnection issues occurred in addition to the game crashing a few times. Due to disconnections and crashes, some of us would find our stuff to be missing completely. Secondly, the frames would drop all of a sudden and never pick up, causing the immersion and overall ability to play well to decrease significantly. What I do and what I see do not line up, therefore making it impossible to smack a soldier ant with the ant club at full velocity to stun it. Thirdly, this is something only I encountered out of my 4 friends (separate occasions), the angle in which I hold my items, such as the bow and arrow, become slanted as well as the third person point of view. This slight angle messed up the aiming of the bow, making it more difficult to see what you're aiming at. Finally, sometimes when you log back into a game, you spawn underneath the world and fall down into the endless void. Those are some of the dilemmas we faced throughout our play of the game and we hope to see those fixed some time in the near future. All in all, me and my friends thoroughly enjoyed the game and are looking forward to what Grounded has to offer next. On a side note, I found the building system to be quite rebellious and weird. It may just be me but I think it needs to be improved upon just a bit. All in all, the game was an absolutely beautiful experience and I am supporting Grounded all the way.

It could be a masterpiece and really demonstrate, how powerful the Unreal Engine could be.
Sure, there are many things, devs should ( and MUST!) work on or revamp, but in its current state, it's quite fun and entertaining. The building system, also the crafting techniques are really interesting and well made.

Sounds and visuals are on top and imho the devs did a great job there, for all other stuff, i will send a bigger feedback straight to the devs. Sure, its a little overpriced and for the money, you wont get a perfect game, you wont get a polished game and , though, you really wont get a (Lady)Bug free game, but what you get is the chance to be part of something, what could get really big and groundbreaking in a really new setting never seen before in 25 years of gaming experience and maybe...maybe you will regret you've not bought this shining jewel of a survival & crafting title early on.

73,73644012,english,"Regardless of the fact that this game is in early access (beta), it is still super fun, and worth the $30 price tag.

- The graphics are endearing and well done.  The lighting in the game is beautiful.  The environment is interesting, fun to explore, exciting. You FEEL small because the scale is spot on and the distance is blurred, giving the impression that everything around you is even bigger.

- The sound is amazing.  Scary things in the game REALLY scare, even just with the noises that they make.  Anything significantly larger than you that is running through the grass after you barrels through the stalks, hitting each one aside terrifyingly as you hear it getting closer and closer, and it's so well done.  The background ambient noises remind you once in a while that you're still JUST in a back yard, even if you've been focusing on surviving as an ant.  A car bumping music in the street passes by.  A dog barks in the distance.  A loud engine drives on the next street over.  All the while, you've been running for your life from a stinkbug.  It's excellent.

- The base building is enjoyable, and can be difficult in single player.  I think the difficulty is a positive, because it gives you something to do and look forward to.  If you are given everything too easily, the game doesn't feel worth it because you have had nothing to adventure for.  If you are playing single player, getting the materials to create a sturdy base can be time consuming!  I enjoy every minute of it anyway.  The bases look adorable when they are done.  The textures of the materials make sense for the world that you live in - a lantern is a sprig with a single tiny flame atop a burning piece of sap.  And it's believable!

-  THE GAME NEEDS WORK but I still believe it is worth its price point, even at this stage.  This is the type of game, like Conan Exiles, or ARK, or No Man's Sky, where I don't expect to be playing it 100% of the time all the way up to its release date.  I'll play it for a couple of weeks, get bored and run out of things to do, and I'll come back for the updates.  I'm 100% ok with that.  I expect it.  I don't love any of the other games I mentioned any less because of it.

- THERE ARE BUGS (not just the 8 legged kind).  Some of them are very annoying.  I encountered a bug where when I attempted to exit the building hotmenu the game crashed. 6 times in a row. It was annoying. My game crashes when playing with friends at least once or twice a night.  The building UI is a bit skitzy and sometimes rapidly switches snapping positions.  Your worn items and the items in your hotbar still exist in your bag, which is confusing and not standard for survival games.  The storyline is very, very unfinished (I'm talking about 3 major missions, then ""dailies"").  There are plenty of things that need working on. Things that could possibly put a frown on your face when you play.  I still think this game is worth it.  I've played for 45 hours so far, and I'm not finished.  I will be coming back to see what's new with every update.  If I stopped playing today, and payed less than a dollar for every hour that I've enjoyed this game, it would be worth it.

Bottom line: Grounded is engaging, beautiful, unique, fun, and at times can be quite difficult.  I love it.

The building strength of buildings need a bit more adjustments.  There is no point in building a base just for it to get demolished by a swarm.  They pretty much bulldoze through your whole base.  Bases are meant to built for shelter and security from outside elements.

I am caught in the middle right now.  As it is now, it is very difficult for a player to build and keep their base.

My friend and I just alt F4 ed because the larva swarms just keep coming at our base and tearing everything down. The larva respawn so quickly, do insane damage, and have what seems like unlimited health. The larva issue seems to stem from having food at the base, so if you don't have food there it should go away. But what is the point of collecting food then? The spiders also seem to have very high aggro. If you come anywhere near them they come at you so quickly and then wont leave you alone so if you're in your base you're just trapped. 

The devs definitely need to work on the bugs (literally) so you aren't so screwed at the beginning of the game. Another thing is that they should also make the armor you are wearing not count as inventory slots used.

Cons
- Save bugged out to where the time stopped completely, making it so we can't progress. 
- Dandelion puffs will spas out on occasion. 
- You can't loot other players backpacks.
- If you fall in water while holding something you can't pick it back up.
- I have had multiple wolf spiders outside of the main spawn.
- Armor stays in your inventory even when equipped.
- You can only drop one item at a time.
- Sometimes mobs health will reset too quickly (around a minute) after you stop attacking or when they lose aggro. 
- You can only craft one item at a time. 
- A visual glitch when joining friends that resets your weapon durability until you hit something with it. 
- Story is very short and unfinished, although that's to be expected for right now.
- A bit pricey for an early access game.

Pros
- Runs as smooth as butter, even for my partner that has a 970. 
- Looks absolutely stunning visually.
- Music is beautiful and matches the game well. 
- Very unique concept for a survival game.
- Has taken a lot of mechanics from The Forest (like wood cutting). 
- Multiplayer works with no issues what so ever. 
- Story thus far is very interesting (what do you expect from obsidian). 
- Map is a decent size. 

Negative Reviews
Do not listen to most of the negative reviews! They're from people that don't know how to read descriptions (I've seen lots of people complain about logging into Microsoft even though it says it on the steam page), don't know how to use Microsoft's app to play multiplayer, and have no idea what early access is supposed to mean (or sometimes even dog on it just because Microsoft is a 3x A company).

My Thoughts
This is an early access game and it was released in this way only a few days ago. This is something you should really think about before spending $30 on a game. All in all I would say if you don't mind waiting for future story updates, don't mind there not being a ton of content, and enjoy the genre then go for it. I do think its a bit pricey so if you're short on money or are still on the fence wait for a sale.

20,73635052,english,"A great example of what a Triple A developer can accomplish through an Early Access release.

Enemies are buggy, pun intended, but they work to an extent, pathfinding needs refinement as enemies can glitch into places they shouldn't be, or they just won't find their way around your house. Enemies are also attracted to your base and will come to destroy it, so build high off the ground if you want it to last.
Base building works but could use refinement, some floor and wall placements don't magnetise to where they're needed and sometimes you'll have to glitch out a placement just to get it to fit and walking over a wall where you have placed roof makes you glitch out. 
Water droplets in multiplayer, especially those from juice boxes can make your Co-op partners crash due to latency and really large ""water clouds"" can happen which act like a small explosion and cause these crashes.

The Story is lacking pretty much everything currently, yet the area you can explore is massive, and interesting things are hidden away enough so that finding them is a small story of its own. Certain parts of the map, like other research rooms hidden in trees and underground are currently locked and seem inaccessible because the content will come at a later date.

The core mechanics of hunger and thirst are a little troublesome at first but you can survive 4/5ths of a day with filled meters and finding clean water isn't necessary as most food fills you right up, you can just drink dirty water and have a snack to be fine from then on.

The art style is refreshing, character commentary is cute while being slightly repetitive, the gliding and jumping mechanics are just okay, they work but can get stuck on objects here and there. Character and Item hit-boxes need to be refined and walking into objects with physics can make them fling off into orbit.

Overall it's worth the price seeing as I've dipped my hand into lots of Early Access titles before and they never had the depth this one has right out of the gate. Obsidian has done a good job and considering their record with games, I doubt this one will be forgotten by the Dev team.

It is a game much more enjoyable with a team, in which we have 3-4 players on at most times.  
I play almost solely survival games and can say that this game will be one of my favorites as long as content is released regularly.  I have had the occasional crashes, glitches (most frustrating is the chest glitch where if there is only one spot left open in the chest it regularly deletes whatever item you try to put in that spot), and other random frustrating events; but all-in-all this is a great start. 
This game definitely needs some refinement and content but you are still only limited to your imagination and combat is great with teamwork.

OK. I have extensive experience with survival type games and this one is LACKLUSTER at best.

Pros: 
-Very nice graphics - beautiful vibrant coloring 
-Combat system is pretty good, (except creatures get stuck on objects on the map often making it cheap to kill even the most vicious of monsters.)
-(Thats pretty much it)

Cons: 
-Small map
-Little to do
-Boring after 2 hours 
-Not worth the price
-Poor story line
-Much more but hard to explain

Overall: Decent experience but definitely not worth the price. Would be a fun little game for a young child but far from what a experienced survival player is looking for. You can walk from one edge of the map to the other in only a couple minutes. Very limited things to do.

In the meantime I expect a lot of hours of game play on what is currently released.  Is this title worth the money?  For me yes.

82,73628876,english,"So far the game has been quite enjoyable. I love the style of it (The ants are absolutely adorable) and I believe the game certainly has a lot of potential. If you're interested in getting an early start in base building and learning the survival side of things, by all means get the game. However, it's not without its issues.

The story is done within 20 minutes of starting a game -- kind of to be expected honestly, as the game is in early access. I don't generally play these kinds of games for the story and lore though, but rather the creative aspect of it. 

It's fun choosing a base location and finding where might be ideal. Some areas, which I found out the hard way, are going to face bug infestation no matter how well you try to fortify it. I personally like this factor though.

There's various bugs that make the game a bit difficult to play.
- Getting caught in a web can force you to kill yourself, as it'll sometimes trap the player in the web even after it's destroyed. 
- Backpack issue. While I haven't personally dealt with it, my friend who I share a server with has had his backpack fall through the map, making it completely inaccessible. 
- Crashes. It feels like once you spend so much time in a world (multiplayer), the game will frequently crash for no reason, making it impossible to play. 

Overall, I would recommend the game if you're interested in coming into it for the survival aspect of it. Even then, play with caution -- there's numerous issues that need to be addressed. I personally didn't mind paying the $30 price point, and even paid for a game and a half for friends.

Over all, I'd give this game a rock solid 6/10.

[Detailed Review]
With over 100 hours on xbox pc game pass before buying it outright on steam I have a lot of respect and love for this game. As a streamer who plays and streams a variety of games for 10-16 hrs a day 7 days a week I have to say this game took me by surprise. It was on my radar the second it was announced on xbox game pass. I am a Gen X baby folks so I grew up to the Honey I shrunk the Kids movies and was all for a game featuring that universe. I was to be honest worried the dev's might mess this up as many have before with so many other games recently. While there are a number of issues and minor glitches here and there as in any game still in development, this game is from the start addicting.

Small size about 4 GB total download, that is crazy small for this great game!
Not only do you get to run around the back yard as kids shrunk down encountering all manor of bugs and life as you would expect, but you get added to that a surprising great and well thought out base building feature!
The initial game at the time of this review has a small main story side that you can go through in not too long if you put your mind to doing that and little else in your life...<looks around innocently>
There is tons of replay ability here though folks there really is. From easter egg hunting [4 leaf clover cave anyone?] to building up a fun large base for you and your friends to use when playing together to farming up all the components to make all the gear you and your friends will be needing too!
I can easily say I have already over 100 hours in and more to come as I work on my base now and look for solutions to the thieving ants! Little buggers will sneak into your place in search of loot [food] from your storage, even through walls!
100% recommend this title to any and all ages!

Problems:
---------------
Minor clipping issues with playable characters.
Graphical glitches some times with items in your hands [only happened twice for me] Spear overlapping the canteen
Ants able to loot through walls even from ground to higher levels of your base into even the acorn chests. Nothing is safe from them thieves I tell ya!
Inability to pick up items in the water or really manipulate them..example berries that fall and you need or building materials that you lose because you suddenly need to leap in the water to avoid a huge spooder from hell ripping your face off.
Wolf spiders in single player need rebalance.
Things I would like to see added

railings/banisters for the stairs and other things we build like patio's etc

It has nice tier progression thus far, I'm hoping the tier progression grows further than tier 2 (idk if it does, if it does I haven't gotten there yet). The graphics look awesome in this game. I am hoping for some sort of ability to increase backpack size since your weapons and armor take up slots in your inventory, and your inventory is fairly limited since the meat of the insects don't stack unless it's jerky and everything else only goes up to stacks of 10. I do enjoy building in this game, however, with the limited amount of weeds/dandelions around you and with no way to carry more than 5 at a time (unless ant armor), it is a bit of a pain to run back and forth 20 times just to build a small base.

The game definitely has promise. Sadly, I only got it for Multi-player with friends and all of them had an abysmal time trying to get things to work. From having to create a Microsoft Account to not being able to find each other in lobby. The price tag of 30$ is also steep for an early access with this much issues but I was willing to cash it out in order to support Obsidian. 

Unfortunately all of my friends have requested refunds and without anyone else to play this game with I really don't see the use of keeping it. Hopefully the game reaches a more stable build soon as I'd be willing to purchase it again.

At this point I'd much rather pay more for a fully fleshed out game than to have hope that a Developer will deliver with it's promise.

For the actual gameplay you'll spend 10 to 30 minutes on the story before completing it. Then the only thing left is going through the whole map beating up enemies, specifically with a weapon made from ants, as later weapons are literally all worse. There is no better weapon past what you can make from ants; enemies you can slap down with your bare hands. Once you have full ant, you can probably take on Wolf Spiders, which are currently the hardest enemy. Beside equipment there's other content, and it isn't finished, they probably started working on it last tuesday by the looks of it.

It's the well-known genre of basebuilding/survival, where you can build a base, explore, and gradually get better resources and equipment. It works well. Both alone and with friends.

What I think makes it stand out is the visuals. It is a unique setting – and it also looks great!

Pros:
* Looks great
* Plays well
* Original setting
* Fun both alone and with friends
* A ton of potential here. There is so much fun things they can easily implement and build on this.
* Scary spiders, but they have an arachnophobia-setting you can use to dial back their appearance to something less scary!

Cons:
* Very Early Access. It just released. This means there is a chance you will run into frequent crashes or gamebreaking bugs requiring you to start over or reload an older save – although it has not been a major issue for me.
* A LOT of content still missing. It is clear more is planned. There are locked doors to several bases/labs that you can't enter, and several areas are literally marked in-game as ""under construction"".
* Bad pathfinding for the Ai enemies. It is often trivial to make them get stuck somewhere silly so you can just slowly take them down with a ton of weak arrows from a safe distance. I hope they improve this, as it makes some things a bit easier than it should be.

59,73494041,english,"The short version is that this is a great game well worth the money, the fact that its EA simply means that they are going to continue to develop this game with adding more content and fixing bugs for free.

I have seen many games that are more jank and with the same level of content or less for the same price being sold as a finished product.

If I were to compare this game to another I would have to compare it to The Forest, which even today still feels like an early access game that people genuinely enjoy. Grounded has more polish and more depth than the Forest in its current state and there is plenty more to come for this game.

If you enjoy exploration, survival and sandbox base building style of games but wished there was one with more of a challenge, this is the game for you, the combat in this game takes skill in timing with blocking and attacking and learning enemy attack animations much like dark souls and is about as punishing where you have to return to your death spot to retrieve what was lost.

The Good:

- The graphics are great.

- The combat although a bit plain is challenging, rewarding and satisfying to watch the bug guts fly.

- The exploration is decent, the map is not overly large at least as of yet, but it is beautifully crafted and I believe they plan to expand it.

- The base building is simple and clean, the blueprints snap together with ease and minimal restriction.

- The crafting is simple and intuitive in its current form and from what I have heard directly from the Devs is that they plan to add QOL improvements such as proximity crafting from materials stored in chests that are close enough to the crafting station.

- The Story for now is extremely short but this does not go into the Bad list since the story albeit short is also great for what is already in and there is plenty more to come and if they continue with the same quality I am excited to see what they come up with.

- The replay value of the game so far is great, depending on where you build determines how difficult your life will be and there are plenty of different places to build, plenty of different resources to gather, plenty of upgrades to craft, with more still yet to come and last but not least the reactive environment keeps things fresh and challenging as bugs wander through your base to ether steal your things or to settle a beef they have with you from earlier.

- Good for facing your fears... anyone with a fear of spiders or other insects may possibly benefit from being able to face their fears head on.

The Bad:

-There is not much to put in here that is considered a long term issue as most of these things will be ironed out over the course of Early Access but I figured I would post them anyway since they are current issues and need something to put here.

-Outclassed, some enemies feel a bit overpowered and I have not got far enough into the game yet to know how many tiers of gear there currently are and how much easier it makes taking on the tougher bugs but I suspect that in the future we will get higher tier gear to help out a bit more than what we have now making the game feel a bit less tedious and still offer a challenge which like the rest of the things in the bad list will probably all be sorted out at some point in development.

-In General the UI is a bit buggy, The UI and controls with keyboard and mouse are bit janky when it comes to backing out of some menue screens like crafting or radial wheel. Sometimes the escape key does not back you out of the window and you have to click the button with your mouse. I rebound my inventory to Tab instead of I and Tab will open the Inventory fine but will not close it again and instead shifts the current highlighted UI slot.

-The bugs are bit buggy, sometimes they spawn in overwhelming numbers, and can clip through your walls or even spawn in your base if its big enough.

-The lack of one specific graphical option Depth of Field, what this option does is changes the focus of the player camera so that distant objects and terrain are either blurred or crisp and clear as things right in front of you, and on one hand I can see why the devs left this option out, it is very much apart of the atmosphere of the entire concept of the game, the feeling of being shrunk down and the world being much larger than what it should be and the blurry distance is apart of what makes that feeling come to life. However I still feel that option should be left up to the player to decide.

On The Fence:

- I am a bit half and half on how I feel about the Price of this title at least in its current state. I paid $40 CAD and feel it is far more than a fair price for the final product once it releases with all the content they plan to add and all the issues ironed out. I also feel it is a bit over priced for its current state by about $10 CAD but after a few updates I expect that the price I paid will be right on par with what I expect to get for my money.

I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys being creative with building and exploring in a hostile and challenging environment. Or anyone who just wants to smash some bugs!",1596077314,1596304118,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True,76561197971620421,56,3,240,0,192,1596152653

Can't wait to see further development!

We need more character choices, ones that aren't super campy and annoying would be nice. I want a 'bad ass' and a 'goth' kid. 
The building is very janky right now.  Hard to build walls, as any hill of leaf gets in the way, and critters WILL come right through the slightest gap.  I want to be able to build into and around the environment better.  Currently you're better off with a square base on a flat open patch. 
I really really want some character progression, some level ups, some perks, some stats that increase.  Want more personalization in the characters too, different outfits and things.
Needs more crafting, building, gear, variety. But that is to be expected in early access.
I encountered a program bug or 2, but in general things went very smoothly, including multiplayer which was so easy to jump in and out of. 
Lastly, they need to figure out leaf physics better, specifically the Clovers.  You should be able to walk through small plants, pushing the clover leaf out of the way.  I found myself getting stuck on small plants and clovers pretty regularly.  

Awesome game!  If survival crafting is your jam, this is the AAA version you might have been wishing for!  Bravo Obsidian!  Keep up the good work!

As for the survival aspects, you build bases, gather resources and make armour. It's similar to the forest but instead of cannibals it's insects. Which in my opinion makes it a lot scarier and a lot more fun. The spiders look amazing and because you're tiny they really do scare you half to death. Not many games scare me, but this one in particular causes me to have full on panic attacks when I'm playing just because of how threatening everything looks.

So far no weird game bugs or glitches (except for the actual bugs that are in the game of course, many insects), although building system could be a little polished as the placement sometimes goes a bit crazy at certain angles and positions.

Game runs super smooth, doesn't require a very powerful PC at all, can easily run it at maximum graphics while still having decent FPS on a laptop with a GTX 1050 without starting a fire.

I have no regret instantly buying this game after only seeing a tiny bit of gameplay, I wanted to see the rest for myself and I love it so far.

I have never feared spiders, including the big ones like tarantulas and such but this game is teaching me to fear them like a arachnophobe, I still refuse to use the arachnophobia-safe mode because the hella scary looking spiders make night time and certain places a whole lot scarier and more interesting at the same time.

Some spider species like the wolf-spider and such will wander around at night, very hard to kill, certainly scared me multiple times and will certainly prevent you from staying at the same spot outside for too long if you don't have a base yet.

I love the style and concept of this game but man those spiders in VR are scary as F!
The game feels more alive in VR, becuase you are inside the game and you get to appreciate the size and scale of the world and its insects.

Me and my boy got it, it says we have 15 hours played but thats mostly because of 2 reasons:  Couldnt find berries (didnt google it) and base building (where we built our base we had no weeds, took forever to get logs).  You could ""finish"" the main story in like an hour or two, and once you start unlocking everything there really isnt anything to do with it.  

Pros:
Runs well:  Nice and smooth only crashed like 2-3 times for me, and it doesnt tell you why so....yea
Atmosphere is good:  Did a really good job of making you feel like youre tiny af
Everything stays there:  Like if you shoot an arrow somewhere....that mf will still be there like 8 days later, shit does not despawn at all.

What needs work:
Battle system:  FUCKING GNATS ARE IMPOSSIBLE TO FUCKING HIT THOSE FUCKING FUCKS SOMEHOW KEEP TAKING ALL MAH SHIT OUT OF MY CHESTS THAT IN MY HOUSE AND KEEP FLYING AROUND AND BOOPIN THEIR FUCKING DUMBASS WHOLE BODY INTO MY WALLS OVER AND OVER AND IF YOU TRY TO HIT THEM, SOOOOOMEHOW MAGICALLY YOU HIT YOUR WALL THATS FUCKING 8CM AWAY FROM YOU WHICH LEADS TO MORE OF THOSE FUCKING FUCKERS GETTING INTO YOUR HOUSE, STEALING MORE OF YOUR SHIT.
Inventory:  Sometimes...the things you put into a basket or chest just magic themselves into the 8th dimension.  No...they arent gone, but you cant see them and you have to kind of move shit around and then they will just magically pop back up.  Really annoying when you are trying to make things.  Just needs a little looking at, probably a quick fix.
Endgame:  Apparently its a known bug, but the lab where your lil burgler robot is that you have to talk with to unlock things with SCIENCE will lock back like it was in the beginning and there is no way to unlock it again.  You end up making a large pile of grass logs in the back cave entrance in order to jump in and its like the whole thing is reset.

CONS:
FUCKING GNATS....FUCK THOSE THINGS
Wolf Spiders...granted, they will fuck you up in real life as a normal size human, but bitchboy i got acorn armor, you shouldnt be one shotting me.
The story is just.....shallow.  And once you get to burglerbot, youre just like....wait really?  They shouldnt have released it in this state because people that buy it will be like...oh yea that game, remember they got bored of it too quick and wont really give a shit about the updates...which doesnt matter cause they all got their money anyways.

Reviewed on August 2020

After playing it for roughly 4 hours , I can honestly say that this game has  potential to be the next ""Minecraft"" or ""ARK Survival Evolved"".

Grounded is developed by Obsidian games who are known for their superb RPG games and great storytelling and narrative experiences. Obsidian touches are clearly present in this game, especially with the narrative ,the environmental story telling, and art style that they're aiming to add to this game. While most of these features are still under-developed, this is still a solid survival game by itself. 

Pros (+)
- Unique setting 
- Art Style and Graphics are impressive 
- Great Base Building Mechanic 
- Great Stability for an Early Access Game 
- Tutorial does a good job at introducing the basics 
- Cross play with Xbox and PC

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cons (-) 
- Game world feels small
- Few enemy types (Spiders , Solider Ants , and  Robots are probably the only hostile species in this game ) 
- Underdeveloped story features, with the story content leaving you wanting more


The game is no where near finished  it still needs more updates and features to make it worth your money, however, in its current state the game is fun and the survival loop would satisfy fans of this genre.

But I really do believe that this game will get better and better, it has a lot of potential! I have played it solo so far, and I can say that it was a very fun and learning experience. I can recommend building a base that is positioned up high, because your base could otherwise get attacked by soldier ants, larvaes or spiders and that could get really annoying. If you need to kill a spider or a stink bug, standing on top of a lady bug and shooting them with arrows could make them fight each other and you could just run back and watch them kill each other. 

Another tip is using a bow and arrow to shoot down the droplets on the leaves instead of using an axe (it's just way faster and your arrow doesn't go to waste)
If you easily get scared then I would recommend playing with friends, that may boost your confident.

PROS:

- Great and interesting theme of ""honey i shrunk the kids""
- Cool art style of the game
- First and third person
- Good mechanics ( you can jump on leaves and stuff + way more ) 
- scary big spooder and ladybug and stuff
- Epic to play with friends 
- Nice terrain
- Good building mechanics

CONS:

- Not the best optimized game ( however this is understandable as it has just came out ) 
- Very short story ( will discuss more at the end)
- Limited armor and weapons
- Not the easiest to play alone

Overall this game has incredible potential, I really recommend playing this game in early access and joining their discord to give feedback to the devs. With a complete story, this game will be one of the best. The exact same thing happened with subnautica. It was an ok game but with all the feedback it became really good. Lets just hope that obsidian entertainment really work hard on this game and give frequent updates!

3hours may be a short time to give a positive review in , but that's because there isn't a lot of content here. The game is still very bare bones but is still awesome to say the least. It's early access, you're buying into the future of the game, and ultimately that future is looking bright.

Story wise, there's about an hour of story if you focus on that, but i found myself just wanting to explore and reach the edges of the map because the wow factor is what makes this awesome. Running from terrifying giant(atleast to you) spiders and jumping off of high places, using dandelions as a glider are some of the things that make this super cool. It has a really vibrant look and the building is quite simple and enjoyable. It's awesome to find the normal sized tech in the garden since you're like the size of a button on it, and it's just awesome. 

The game has a lot of potential, it's just really early in development. You'll have a good few hours of fun and then it's back to waiting on the next update which the devs have promised will introduce more story, creatures and just overall additions to game.

Outer Worlds is fairly fun, but it was lacking somewhat.  

The game is very alpha. 
The world maybe customizable, however the characters are not.
You are locked in playing 4 people, i wish you could use your microsoft live avatar, or xbox avatar but nope. 

The bugs are relentless, and when your analyzing samples, you best better hope none of them are near you or you will die. 
Crafting and building needs polishing. 

Everyone is giving it good reviews, when i don't see how or why it would get that.
You want to build stuff, there are other base builders which are way more polished.
Infact even fallout 4 has better base building. 
The only thing the game has for it, is its fruity, and again its a ""honey i shrunk the kids"" theme, but that just doesn't cut it. 

In honesty, i think you should wait for a bit more progress in game development before you buy.

52,73595262,english,"As of now, I do NOT recommend buying the game as it is at 30$, August 1st 2020.

I know for a fact that the Devs did not even bother trying out this game, is this game fun? Yes, absolutely... when it works, 70% of the game does not work properly though.

- Enemies fall thorough the floor and can hurt you or inside rocks
- Enemies WHEN YOU FIGHT THEM, will instead ignore you and attack your base instead (If you are near or defending your home) Im talking about, you smack an ant in the head, and he turns around and rather hit your base

- Enemies can hit your chest and items, through walls, doors, height differences. It does not matter if you put a chest in the middle of a room, or if the enemy is close. If they sense a chest, they cant just hit it no matter what. No ands, ifs, or buts

- You will get stick mid-air, with no way to escape except for re-loading or killing yourself via menuing, when something you're standing on gets destroyed.

- Traps in general don't work, the log traps DO NOT damage enemies, but they damage YOU, how convenient...

- The only NPC that is pretty important since they give you blueprints for more recipes, bugs out and disappears, or the door to him is locked MEANING. That if you played in a world for 10 hours or more, you just lost potential crafting recipes.

- Equipping Armor, does not remove it from your inventory space, so it just clogs up inventory space. In what world? Every game literally doesn't have this issue, so how-- whatever

- I understand its in early access, but 30$? Really? I GUARANTEE, if you buy this game, you will experience everything I listed without even trying to look for them. 

- If you die, you drop your backpack full of stuff. Pretty normal, no problem you can just pick it up. But sometimes, the game will make your bag completely disappear and you just lost all your weapons, armor, and whatever else was inside

- Tier 2 gear is 95% USELESS, there is only 2 items that is Tier 2 that is better than a standard weapon, That is the Insect Bow and the Insect axe, a tier 1 sword is better than the tier 2. An axe (which is primarily used to  collect mats) is better than most of the actual fighting weapons meant for combat.

- Enemy who aren't suppose to be near the beginning area, will spawn in HORDES within the 1st day (sometimes) and when this happens it keeps on happening, its impossible to defend yourself at this part of the day

If you made it this far thank you for reading, I know I just listed negatives, but I honestly enjoy the game, but with this many issues I cannot in good heart recommend such lazy development, you dont even need to be a dev to see the obvious issues, at 30$ no less. If you really want to play the game, just wait until they actually fix the game and save yourself the money. There isn't much to do anyways besides base building

and even then, good luck when enemies rather fight your base than you. Peace out",1596265433,1596265433,False,2,1,0.450698584318161011,0,True,False,True,76561198451047128,18,1,3531,19,2638,1601524858

5. A new take on the survival genre. I would say ""oh my lord this has never been done before"" but it has, just not like THIS.
6. Optimized, sort of. It runs incredibly well on single player. I have words for multi-player, but that's for later.
7. Fantastic, cartoonish graphics. 
8. Entertaining jokes and character dialogue.
9. Interesting, dynamic environment.
10. There's more, but i can't think of it all lol.

Cons.
1. 30 dollar price tag per copy, while technically early access. Big oof. 
2. Extremely convoluted microsoft/xbox login requirement to play multiplayer, especially for those who don't already have it
3. Multiplayer ping is terrible, since it uses xbox/microsoft servers instead of steam
4. adding friends is unnecessarily hard, and again requires them to have an xbox/microsoft account too
5. Arachnophobia mode doesn't quite make the spiders any less fear inducing, but it's not as bad as you think
6. some game progression hiccups and minor lack of clarity, but it's early access so it's no big deal


SUMMERY 
So basically, the game is really fun and has a ton of pros and it's clearly professionally done.
I had issues when the Demo came out and couldn't really play it, but i don't really mind now that i'm here and i can play it NOW. I was super looking forward to it.
Granted, there was NO warning on the steam page or otherwise that a microsoft/xbox account is required, and i wouldn't have known since I don't typically play their games since they don't fit my genre preferences most the time- but the game is fun enough to make up for it and I wouldn't consider refunding or not playing it over something so trivial.

However, i'd really love it if they would include local co-op or some way to get around having to use their servers to play with friends/family/loved ones. As it stands, i expect there to be issues, but I don't honestly care for xbox, microsoft or their stuff/programs/whatever. I'm literally never going to use the xbox/microsoft account for anything beyond this and i don't really want to be forced to have it just to play with some pals. 

Again it's not a huge deal, just annoying. 
If i had to give it's CURRENT, UNFINISHED state a number rating out of 10, it'd be a 7/10. I'll bump it up to 9 if they make local co-op and 10 if they either make it cheaper and add local co-op or fix the requirements for multiplayer. 

If you're a foam at the mouth, void your pants, 360 kill shot xbox fan and you want to tear me limb from limb feel free to comment and make it known idk, i'm just some random on steam. 
But if you have some info i'm unprivy to that might change my mind, i'd love to know tbh.



UPDATE 7/31/2020:
I'll probably update this as the game is developed since i'm SUPER into this.
The number of noticeable bugs has definitely skyrocketed since my first review, and I definitely overestimated the amount of content. There's not much, and it's kind of disappointing. The upside, however- is that it is still early access and most of the issues are with multiplayer. 
So single player is still a good and safe bet right now! They also promised monthly updates just yesterday, so hopefully that'll make way for vast improvements. i'd still say it's a 7/10 as of my increased playtime.",1595969893,1596254014,True,3,1,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,True,76561198162919729,128,10,3553,0,181,1600749167

The Good
Sound/Audio - The tracks I've heard are decent and all of the sound effects are decent quality (insects, weapons, water, and etc).
The game runs perfectly fine for me. I had one crash and I think it's something to do with the auto-save feature. * I should also mention I played the game entirely offline and don't use cloud saving for any games (this has caused issues in the past too).
I think the tiered system and base building is fine for what it is now, but could use some improvements (I'll talk about that in the bad).
The animations are pretty good. Though there's not very many overall per insect.
The models are pretty good and all of the equipment (structures and environment too) that you can craft is detailed pretty darn well. So, props to the artists of that portion of the game. 
The game looks pretty good, fits the theme it's going for. However, I think the map is pretty small. The whole yard is only like 30 feet by 30 feet....so that's a really small house. Just think 500 cm is like 16 feet. That's like from the pond to the oak branch. 

The Bad
""Reactive World"" - ""Explore this immersive and persistent world, where the insect life reacts to your actions."". This is such a reach it's really not even funny. They react to you moving, attacking them, using a lure, or lose aggro if you get far enough away. That pretty much applies to every game...ever. There's nothing unique or innovative about anything the AI does or how it reacts.  Honestly, it's bare bones and pretty bad. 

Tons of insects get caught under large rocks, roots, or the ground. They can clip through this and attack you. They spawn in your base while you're away. They barely react to each other at all. Sure some of them will fight occasionally. If they can path to each other correctly. Otherwise it just looks like they're dancing. Orb Weavers don't attack ants, but will fight lady bugs, which will in turn fight ants. So rock, paper, scissors of reactive insects/arachnids I guess. Their pathing is overall terrible.

Base building placement is awkward and really needs perfectly flat ground. It's functional, but looks terrible. 

The UI is very simple, and looks like something a first timer made with UE and put up as a demo on Itchio. 

That wraps up the good and bad, but I'd like to mention a few gripes I have outside of this review. Anyone giving this a 10/10 or a 0/10 is pretty much useless as a human being. And I'm surprised at some of the positive reviews for this game. This game does nothing new or innovative over games we've seen a dozen times over the past decade. The only thing different about this and it's clones is the aesthetic. 

The crafting is bare bones and just functional. There's nothing unique or special about it over it's competitors. 

The combat is equally bare bones and just functional. Attack (some weapons have a power attack), block (timed blocks negate all damage and stagger), and uhhh...that's it. 

Anyway, that's about it from me. I'll update this review as updates come out. I can't tell you if you'll like this game or not. I'd  suggest watching some video's or streams of it, but I honestly found those pretty boring. And had to try it myself to see what all the fuss was about (it's over-hyped right now in my opinion). I hope things improve quite a bit, but if we go off the experience of it's predecessors.

Sure i guess it looks promising, but really selling a game 40$ for an outstanding 23 minutes of content is a huge NO-NO.

Bugs that should not be present... not even in an early access title.

This is A CASH GRAB and they only want people to throw money at them hoping they can eventually make something decent... Just another game released in a beta state asking you to pay full price. Again, i understand the early access concept being a dev myself,

This game in clearly in a testing phase, and as such a big studio such as Obsidian should PAY to get decent QA and not ask potential buyers to PAY to... Test?! a game... They will only push people away like they did for me.

Gameplay is pretty basic, you explore, gather resources, craft tools and homes, research new items, and work to find food and clean water. It does have a story which makes it more interesting. Also there is a tutorial and optional difficulty setting for the non hardcore gamers.

While taking the game for a test drive via the demo, I was a bit jumpy and I made the mistake of attacking one of the ants (because I assumed the ant intended to attack me), at which point, I was quickly mobbed by the other ants and died... total playtime: about 3 minutes. 

Despite my short life in the demo version, I was hooked and I bought the game as soon as it became available. 

This time, I decided to try and implement a more passive strategy regarding the ants and, by using that strategy, I've learned a valuable lesson... don't judge an insect by its exoskeleton. I've survived for about a week so far and the ants have become my curious and comforting companions :-) I mean, it gets kinda lonely playing single player, but the constant curious clicking noises of my ant friends has kept me company (unlike the buzzing of the not-so-nice knats lol).

I would like to say that it is very fun and has a lot going for it. Lots of quirky humor in Obsidian's style, lots of really fun and challenging game play, and over all a really pleasant experience. 

Actual game play is really solid. There are some fresh mechanics in play with the crafting and building system and a lot of familiar mechanics for folks who are used to survival games. 

Base building is pretty great right now. I would say there are a few recipes that are low tier that feel too expensive, but other than that the risk/reward balance is pretty good. A couple of nit picks I had is that my first base I started next to a plant I thought I could chop down later, I can't. So I had to adapt my base around it and eventually move it. The other is that no matter how well and tough you build your base, bugs will just get in. I have a solid clay foundation and the ants just spawn inside of it. 

Survival is fairly easy once you find a good spot. Food is pretty easy to find and gather once you know where to get it. Hydration is also pretty easy and doesn't feel like a terrible chore.Which is nice because the hostile bugs in this game are way OP for how often you find them. When I first started I was taken out by a wolf spider in the spawn area. Finally found what I thought would be a good location only to find another wolf spider den very close by. I then moved to another area and found yet again another wolf spider den. I think they either need to dial down the amount of bugs, spread them out a bit more, or make them not as tough.

Between being stuck in a ramshackle house I made from clovers as a orb weaver corners me into submission, or riding lady bugs into glorious battle against stinkbugs, I am thrilled with the little details that are already here that make the game great.

This game definetly gives a nice take to this genre and just games as a whole i love the tiny aspect of it.
I havent got that far yet but i am enjoying my time with the game so far.
 Keep in mind its early access so its not flooded with content yet and features but I played ark in early access and I have not played a game this polished in EA  honestly.

45,73559194,english,"The graphics are good, the 2 hours worth of story mission I did was cool, but overall this game is just not worth 30$ and I'll walk through why.

This game has time-gated progression, which I hate when my progression is time-gated. When you discover a new resource, such as grass, dry grass, clay, etc., you need to research it at the science base to figure out what you can craft with it, you can do this 3 times every like 20-30 minutes or so.

This game on ""medium"" difficulty has enemies that can only be beaten by cheesing the environment. Large enemies like spiders can kill you in a single hit and some enemies (wolf spider) can also run a lot faster than you so if you get aggro you are just dead. Only way to beat a lot of these large enemies is to get up high on a rock or something and shoot them with bow and arrow. Its like how you can cheese kill dinos in ARK.

I've played mobile games with more content. It's sad to say, but you can pretty much do everything you want to do in this game within 3 hours. The story mission is fun, but it's also ridiculously short. Building a base is fun, but I've noticed that after building my base, bugs will spawn near it (Larvae, ants) and come try to wreck it. It's pretty stupid that they can destroy your base so fast, and that they spawn in so often. Within like 3 hours Larvae tried to wreck my base 3 times. Enemies should not spawn on my base, nor right next to it. I could understand if I was running from enemies and dragged them back to my base, then it would be my fault if my base got wrecked.

My final point is that while the map is cool, it is currently super small and the points of interest really aren't that interesting. A lot of the map is labeled ""under construction"" and all you can really explore is a small portion of the entire map. I think that they really need to work on the points of interest as well. While it's really cool to find a large hotdog, or a large cassette tape, or a large action figure, or a large soda can, thats really all it is. You get a feeling of ""oh that looks cool!"" but that fades in like 15 seconds and then you realize that was all there was to that point of interest. These points of interest need to have a little bit more to them, it's hard to explain, but I feel as like MOST points of interest should feel more exciting or rewarding or should just have more to them to explore/do.

Finally, in closing I want to state that this game ""could"" be really fun. I like the graphics, I like that there is only food/hunger, and overall the building is not terrible. The map is cool, the characters have good voice acting, the music is good, but overall it is just not worth 30 bucks.

The game is a blast, and you can tell a hell of a lot of love has gone into crafting it, as well as the ai and their habits (I hear ant hills are basically fully simulated little worlds). Any fans of the Forest will feel its very familiar but also completely different at the same time, and not in a bad way. The gameplay loop is very well thought out and even though we reached the end of the intro story in our first play through (It being EA doesn't surprise us that much, the forest was the same at the start) we could tell the game will have a lot more to offer eventually. And for now its a really fun little survival sandbox which none of us thought we needed but anyone who grew up in the 90s will 100% appreciate the setting. 

Overall, great start to a game that has much promise. Gameplay is fun currently and the mechanics are really well thought out.

I've already had 3 bases destroyed by roaming Wolf Spiders and now I'm bunkered up underneath a leaf and am managing to survive. 

Again, this is early access which means that there won't be much to do or that much variety but if you look at a similar game such as ARK, Ark was pretty much in the same boat during early access. Look at it now!

Very fun game thus far but not without issues, which is a tad bit surprising considering who its made by as i would expect a bit better of a product from a company such as this. 

Just a side note, Early Access is not a shield DESPITE some people using it as one. This isn't some""one man dev team"", both Developer and publisher are established heavy hitters in the industry so it is ok to have expected more from them right out the gate.

That being said, i hope the patches come out good and timely as there are many issues Overall Balance being the biggest one, as i do feel this game could be among the other really good survival crafting games (The Forest for example)

I usually don't enjoy survival games because of a lack of storyline and the propensity for them being a killfest with other player killing on sight, making them a tedious version of a PVP shooter since you still have to manage things like eating, drinking, sleeping and whatnot only to kill or to be killed by someone else with zero purpose and then repeat. Boring.

However, Grounded is not like that! It is a really fresh take on the premise similar to ""Honey I Shrunk the Kids!"" with an interesting mystery to solve (though I have to admit, I have yet to fully play out the story) and this means there are actually objectives and purposes to work towards.

The inventory is clunky though and could use some TLC for PC (keyboard) players. Moving stacks to chests and such 'basic' QoL changes/fixes would make a great addition to the game.
Spiders and most other animals can gang up on you as a solo player pretty quick. With spiders being terrifying. 
Path finding on some creatures can be cheesed for easy kills by 'trapping' them behind or between something.

77,73552546,english,"Early Access Review. Grounded is effectively a survival game version of ""Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"". It's well optimised, the building system is polished and it's really immersive to play in, with tons of potential. If you enjoy base building and Crafting, there's probably 10-20 hours of that to do, although I'll admit that the story content is painfully short right now (can be done in less than an hour). I'm excited to see what the game will add over time because my brain is full of ideas for this little world. One of the best games of the year so far and it's only been out for 2 days.

Additional
The other important point is to ignore most of the negative reviews saying either it doesn't have enough content or that the multiplayer doesn't work. 1, it's Early Access - you're not paying for a finished game; you're paying to be part of a development process. If you expect it to be finished, have more content, or it's too expensive, wait for it to be released. Leaving a negative review is worthless. 2, The multiplayer works perfectly, we played for 5 hours in a group of 4 the day after release. It's one of the most polished Early Access games I've played.

[Pros]
+ Gorgeous, especially the lighting
+ The design of the game world is impeccable. You can climb tall things to get a better view, landmarks are easy to spot, creatures move and interact with each other
+ Blueprint system for planning in advance
+ When you throw a spear at a creature, it gets stuck in it
+ Mysteries
+ There are landmarks scattered around the garden which are great to explore as a tiny person.
+ can craft armour out of bugs
+ multiplayer works (but it uses microsoft instead of steam, which is shit and confusing)

[Cons]
- Even on medium, spiders are way too hard. Best armour and weapons before spider tier, still only got one to 25%. If a spider decides to walk through the base it will just kill everyone. That's fine for early game, but they need to be beatable later
- The 'leave feedback' section is literally just an icon system for happy/sad face and a location. There's nowhere to type actual feedback
- It uses Microsoft instead of Steam for multiplayer, which is a genuinely shitty interface for playing together. Once you eventually manage to add each other as friends (which, unintuitively you do by 'following' each other), it took us a while to work out how to stop hearing everyone twice.
- Pathing could be better. Creatures regularly get stuck in large objects or underneath bases

[Wishlist]
- Renewable materials. Looks like dandelions, clay and quartzite don't come back yet
- Bigger inventory through crafting bag upgrades
- Weather. Rain would be awesome
- Some kind of building to explore. I guess the house is ambitious, but there's a shed in the garden
- More weapons and items to craft, with longer production chains
- Some kind of leaf boat you can sail on the pond
- More story
- Custom characters and clothing customisation
- When you wear armour, it shouldn't take an inventory slot
- Fish
- Subnautica bases
- Multiplayer bosses
- More kinds of bugs. Bees, frogs, snails, worms
- Some sort of power system for lighting using a battery for power
- More traps (think Fortnite PVE)
- More points of interest that aren't trash. Garden ornaments?
- Craftable paragliders
- I'd love the landmarks to have more things to explore, like more complicated rubbish rather than just cans",1596186267,1596186267,True,3,0,0.515763580799102783,0,True,False,True,76561197999920602,527,489,812,0,720,1596229943

Also the game feels really great for an early access title. Usually devs will release a clunky buggy mess into early access, they’ll fix the bugs(usually) then ignore the clunky gameplay and just dump new content on top and hope everyone forgets that the game feels like crap. But Grounded actually feels kinda nice from the get go, Yeah it's still riddled with bugs, and desperately needs some actual story to help drive the gameplay. But if Obsidian follows the standard early access plan that I've seen, they’ll fix the bugs and release new content onto the current game; which will be just fine in this case because the game pretty much already feels fine. I can’t wait for the story to open up a bit, and for the backyard to get a few more areas. It’s been a while since I was genuinely hopeful for an early access game.

 - Day night cycle completely breaks later in the game. Night never occurs anymore.
 - All cooking stations (dew catcher etc) break and become un-useeable later in the game making food tricky. Probably has something to do with my broken day/night cycle.
 - Lots of inventory bugs with items, straight up, getting deleted.
 - It seems as though the soda/juice boxes run out? I don't know if that's a bug or intentional.
 - Attacks on your base aren't well distributed. Sometimes there will be 4 attacks of 8 or 9 larva each in a row. My base isn't even that big. I'm afraid it will be destroyed.

The main story quests takes about 30 minutes, so for the time being this is an exploration/base building game. That being said, I got a new storyline quest by exploring. I have not yet found out where to get the information needed.

Playing on the hardest difficulty means that I die really fast in combat, but that's what I wanted. When I first started on normal difficulty, the enemies felt a little bit too squishy for my liking. I WANT to be killed by bugs and spiders many times larger than me. It makes it a lot more scary to play. If you really need a hard-to-get bug part, be smart. Get your enemies to kill each other, then swoop in to loot!

Base building is really good for early access, with a lot of buildable items. Gathering building mats is definitely a long process that involves travel and hard work.

The game was put on steam a little early even for early access standards, and it suffers for it. The story is almost non-existant and playing it now is just kind of spoiler for whats going to be added. But it is a very interesting survival game, that takes a bit of direction from games like ARK and The Forest while still leaving plenty of room (small things joke.) to be a very different game.

THE GOOD:
AI behavior is very interesting and is unlike any other i have seen in a game like this. There is a lot to explore, and that means there is seemingly a lot to do. There is a lot more items then i expected there to be with how early in development this game seems to be.

THE BAD:
While there does seem to be a lot to explore it is much to the games detriment. As tho it seems like a huge world to explore and discover. Its just a standard backyard, and with as behind the game seems to be with most things you would expect from a game.

Review:

For what it currently is  - an **EARLY ACCESS** game with a *limited* story (we only currently get the tutorial - but don't worry hopefully i will appease you below -)

- Ok so as i said - we only get the tutorial *Story Oppener* at the moment - which if you are smart, can be completed in 20 mins or less... **Don't forget it's early access!!** there is  still a TON more things to do!

Build/sruvive/craft

Analyse certain items to learn more recipes (for base/food/health/utility/etc)

fend off a storm of Mites  - squash Gnats (as big as your head) - ride a lady-bird (not a mount, you can just stand on it lol) - run from spiders (i do not mind spiders at all - or let's just say - i never used to... these critters WILL make you jump (at least the first time)

Build a multy floor base on/in/around a tree (or wherever you like)

If things get too hot, you can cool off in the pond and go for a dive.... Why not use you genius and repaire some tech?

---------------------------

other than the above it is just your *typically generic survival game* - but let me tell you this... its the best one i have ever purchased!!!

10/10 - i hope this get's completed - but it is Obsidian so i don't doubt it (KOTOR?)

And to expand upon the quests - once you reach that *certain point - where the tutorial ends and it becomes sandbox* - talk to the cute little guy who looks a lot like a *disco-tech* *Tik-tok* from Return to Oz - he has some quests for you - and you can unlock more things for your builds",1596167350,1596167471,True,0,0,0.456352382898330688,0,True,False,True,76561198042701643,464,80,1549,0,209,1600116577

Green Hell, mixed with Honey I shrunk the Kids, is pretty accurate in my mind.

I like survival games, in general, but to be shrunk down to slightly smaller than an ant adds a whole new dimension to this genre. You research the items you find to unlock new recipes. Blades of grass and dandelion stems can become your shelter. Insect and arachnid parts become armor, food, and crafting ingredients to help make quality of life improvements and advancements. Since it is Early Access at this point, I am sure there will be a large number of additional features added, so I am really looking forward to where this title develops. There are small things that seem glitched here and there, but it isn't really anything major. I had a spider spawn inside my scaffolding one time, which made it really easy to kill. Sometimes when things fall, they seem a little erratic, but I think that stuff will likely be tweaked in the future. I could see some pretty fun multiplayer mini games being implemented into the game. I'd like to see something with a window box fan and the dandelion fuzzes that are used to slow fall from high places where you would compete for distance or something like that. There are a couple of quality of life improvements that I would like to see added to the game - a move stack option as a keyboard shortcut and/or right click menu option, being one, but it isn't all that inconvenient to click and drag from storage to inventory or vice versa. Again, it could be something implemented in the future. I hope so. Overall, though, I would say that this game is one of the top ones on my current list and I expect it to continue to get better.

63,73540913,english,"So heres my input at 55 hours playtime (games only been out 2 days at this point). 

Graphics: Game Looks and runs beautifully. 

Bugs: Being early access I am surprised at only a very small amount of bugs. Runs great and bugs aren't that game breaking. My friends and I have been playing pretty non stop.

Content: Its EA. But there is a extreme lack of content. Within 2 hours of having the game, I beat the game. There are other things you can do after beating the 'storyline' though. Lots of tunnels / caves and things to explore, as well as science to unlock. But that only unlocks bigger / better bases and such. There are parts of the map that are under construction though which gives hope to alot more content. 

How much fun can you get? Id say you can enjoy this game for a solid week of hardcore playing before your burnt out. Or a month of playing a couple hours a day. This IS NOT something you will play non-stop because it does get very repetitive. After beating the strongest spiders out there right now, theres not a whole lot more to work for. The best armor in the game can simply be found. As well as the peppermint and you can obtain them immediatly upon joining a new game aswell. Ive put 55 hours in the game, and i feel like i've done all I can do.

I do stand behind this game because it has MUCH potential. And for a 29.99 price point, you'll get your moneys worth. Just praying the Dev's keep updating this!",1596161078,1596161078,True,0,2,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,True,76561197965837135,116,4,3791,0,3353,1599203112
64,73540894,english,"Not recommended...yet

First - just beware the story line for this game ends very quickly. It's early access so that's okay with me, but just be aware of that. 

The good: Amazing concept. The world is very immersive and realistic. You really do feel like your 2mm tall in a back yard. 

Here's why I don't recommend though:
The problem with this game is how incredibly small it is. For example - to walk from the first major landmark you come to in the story (laser pad thing) to the second major landmark in the game (the tree, which is where the story currently ends) takes 94 seconds. 

If I assume that I am 2mm tall in the game (based on the size of the small ants that look like grease ants) and that the average person walks 1.5 meters per second, that converts to an in game distance of 15 centimeters (or about 141 meters of real life walking).

Looking at the in-game map, that is about 20-25% the distance of the entire map. In other words the entire map encompasses about a square meter. 

Granted this is an estimate, but even if my estimate is off by 100%, that's still a very, very small world. 

When I have fallen into other survival games - the first thing you get is a sense of scale and loneliness. In other games sometimes it's a long time before you come into contact with anything except trees and dirt but in this game you are interacting with bugs and objects within seconds. 

Maybe this game is intended for kids with short attention spans (all the characters are kids so maybe that's it) but if you're used to playing traditional survival games on the PC I don't think you will like this. 

I am definitely going to try it again in a few months to see where it is.",1596161046,1596161046,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True,76561198095018445,191,13,230,0,211,1596161121

Pros:  - A great setting
          - Base Building that actually works on launch
          - Terrifying Spiders and Insects (nighttime has a great atmosphere)
          - Gorgeous art style and great voice acting
          - Tool and Science progression
          - A good core survival game to build a story mode on
          - Working Multiplayer which has (after 20 hours) only had a handful of crashes

Cons: - No Skill tree implemented yet (not sure if this is planned)
          - Difficulty may put some off initially (medium still has spiders who can 1 shot you if you're not careful, reccomend 
             easy mode!)
          - Not much penalty for death since there's no exp or skill system so it can take the edge off gameplay.
          - Solo gameplay can feel unbalanced compared to multiplayer as enemies are the same strength and outnumber you 
            quickly.
          - Some crashes and visual glitches (Giant Arrows and Frame eating Juice bombs!)

Overall: 8/10 Would love to see what they do with the story and skill/exp progression in the future.

91,73538914,english,"TL/DR: 10/10; Gameplay is great, multiplayer stability is great, playing solo or with your friends is equally enjoyable. Really hit the nail on the head with this one, looking forward to countless hours in Grounded. 

While being in the same vein as ARK survival evolved or Conan: Exiles, Grounded is a breath of fresh air! A much more casual experience, with less severe death penalties than the aforementioned titles. The wonder of exploring a beautifully created world, that feels immersive and exciting. The ability to speed up time, and skip the night using a bed, makes the early game a bit more manageable, while giving the opportunity to increase the risk/reward when you gain the confidence to take on the night. 

connecting with my friends and playing co-op was a snap! And being able to join in on my friend's game, if they need help, or they can join mine if I do, really fantastic. Some folks will probably lament the lack of a PvP experience, but to me, it doesn't feel like I'm missing out on anything. And, while the Multiplayer is limited to 4 players, limiting the number of people you can play with, it certainly does seem to make it much more stable when playing online (A critical failing of certain other titles in a similar vein). 

The cycle of finding new resources, analyzing them, learning new recipes to build and be able to take on new challenges, for new resources...etc. Feels smooth. Learning the ""tech tree"" does not feel clunky, or overwhelming. I really can't say enough for how great this game is... and it's only in Early Access.

He held the torch and the hammer and went to work on the quartzite while I fought off a horde of ants. 10 minutes of fighting go by quick as we dive deeper and deeper into their lair. Finally we came to a dead end, but not just a simple dead end, we arrived at one of their food chambers.

73,73530004,english,"TL;DR: The best way to get arachnophobia or prasinophobia, or both!

The game itself is actually fairly stable, and I have found few bugs (HA HA BUGS, BECAUSE THERE ARE BUGS IN THE GAME HA HA) that seem to ruin. There has been only one CTD in 20 hours of play at the time of this writing, and so far I haven't seen anything that does not appear to be working as designed. A few balance issues could stand to be addressed, and the game desperately needs to recognize player bases to avoid enemies spawning inside compounds, but I do not know if this can actually be fixed. 

I honestly can't tell if the dynamic ecosystem promised actually exists. Respawn times for spiders and so forth seem a bit fast, but this could still be working as they intended. 

If you're here for Obsidian's story-telling chops, I have to say you're out of luck right now. The story quests take less than 25 minutes to complete if you follow them directly. There are radiant quests you can follow to accumulate the currency used to buy items from the one NPC there is. Other than that, you'll find the most fun right now through base building, survival, and exploration.

The last thing I will add here is that this should be qualified as a survival horror/open world game, not just open world. The spiders move quickly, quietly, and are nearly instant death when they show up. Nothing is more terrifying than seeing blades of grass move in the distance, wondering if an eight legged menace is about to show up and make you scream like a little girl. Honestly, I don't think the arachnophobia setting makes it any better, as the floating bobs are way creepier to me. Still, I don't think I've ever seen more realistic spider movement portrayed in a video game. Thank god they can't currently climb.

As it stands as of writing this, it is without question a game designed for 3-4 players. It is a social game. I have played thus far only solo, and I can say that it is a challenge to go it alone. It is still a great deal of fun playing solo, but certain challenges (such as spider defense) is highly improbable. With a team... I can see it.
As of now, multiplayer is via XBox Live only, with more expansion to come.

They asked for my help as a test bed and after 48 hr, they came up with a hot patch and allowed me to test the alpha patch!
This is great service and tech support from Microsoft Xbox Team.
For that kind of speedy support and tech service, I give the game 100%

89,73527729,english,"highly polished early access game.  I was hesitant initially due to the first reviews having a lot of negativity but then realized a lot of them were due to the idea that you have to have xbox live to play with friends.  The second login is seamless once you connect and set it up the first time and xbox live is free for pc.  So that out of the way..  

the graphics are very polished, the optimization, at least for me, seem well done as i can't recall having any kind of lag or problems with jitter etc during my first hours of playing.  it's a whimsical, cartoon style take on the survival genre but be warned, as cute as the graphics are, it is, indeed a survival game.  you can and will die in early game - the spiders are as deadly as they look and as of yet i  have not found an effective defense or offense against them.  I'm sure that's because I haven't progressed far enough.  i will be honest, if i was not a veteran of survival games i would be far more frustrated with the difficulty of spiders and some other enemies.  

The building is interesting and though I haven't progressed far enough for any advanced building (if there is any in game yet idk) but I like this aspect and it's very important to my gaming needs to be able to create bases/buildings and craft items.  The mechanics of it, seem to take a cue from the forest or games like it, you place a ghosted ""plan"" for a piece, be it wall, door or window etc then build by adding the needed materials for that.  i feel like it's so much like the forest in this aspect that some of the devs must have played that game but that's just speculation on my part.  this isn't a bad thing whatsoever as I love the building in the forest  too.  

Story is standard fare for survival games, and personally I do like story in games but for a survival crafting game it's not entirely essential to have it.  The story is short simply because it's incomplete so that's mostly all I can say about it at this point.

Things that I think can and hope will change: 
Difficulty even on ""mild "" only adjusts hunger and thirst, seems that the enemies are still just as deadly.  I expected this to be adjusted also but if it is lowered, it's not by any noticeable amount.  The number of characters and/or character customizer would be nice.  I'd like to either have a better choice of characters or be able to make one myself.  I hope they add something along those lines later, as  i don't think there are major reasons to make a limited set of characters since it doesn't seem like their personalities or uniqueness is much more than aesthetic if you play in 3rd person view.    

Even the qualms i have about this game are pretty minor,  so this comes highly recommended.",1596136201,1596136201,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True,76561197972573639,443,64,6502,100,472,1602025256

Specific building pieces will not attach to assets already in the game and you are forced to build in places where you'd not really desire to. Another drawback is that the only way to carry 8 things is with a full set of Ant Armor. I would like to see some form of cart that you can bring with you and load things in or on to, much they did with The Forest. This would help if the location you built in wasn't near other specific resources like weeds and such that weren't close by. I've also been wondering if Weeds actually respawn after some time because the ones I have chopped down so far for my base have not come back.

I understand that many are complaining about multiplayer not working however I was able to get it to work first try with very little issues. I played with 3 other people all in my own household so that might be why it worked without hiccup. Although it should still be going through the internet before it gets to my hosted game. We all play on PC though so maybe that's why. We also had a friend join in from across the country and he joined just fine. Everyone has to ensure they are logged in to a valid microsoft account. Needless to say this game is EARLY ACCESS which means it's not ready. It drives me crazy to see someone complain about a game and it's bugs when the game isn't even finished yet. If you buy this game you should fully expect to run in to random things that don't work. Maybe your location, ISP, connection, or PC build are preventing you from connecting to or hosting a multiplayer game. Maybe your game will randomly crash on you or something really weird will happen in game. Again, THESE ARE TO BE EXPECTED!!! IT'S EARLY ACCESS!!! But if you can accept that and enjoy the game for what it's current state is then you will have a blast. The amount of content the game already has is awesome. I don't like spiders but I don't fear them. This game, however, makes you fear them. I absolutely love that they can instill fear without resorting to zombies or some other overly used tactic. This is also a game that I would be totally fine starting all over again if need be because of a crash or patch. Although that hasn't happened yet. So far 5 of my friends and family have purchased this game and absolutely love it. For an early access game the Devs did an amazing job prepping it before releasing it for us to test out.

There isnt much relaying of information leaving you to wonder what to do and figure out. Seeing tons of items that can be harvested with a level 2 axe is quite frustrating when you have zero clue how to get that axe. Not to mention base building is completely pointless since worker ants and larva come around and destroy your base before you can even finish building it. The weapons are no better than punching with your fist except weapons swing slower than your fist. There is a button designed just to preview your hot bar, what a worthless idea that was seeing as you cant move your items when you press v but you can view and change it all in your inventory. 

Now multiplayer, dear god what a disaster this turned out to be, well its constantly crashing with half of my friends group were not even able to play. And lets talk about the lag somehow this game has a high ping when youre playing with 1 other person in the same country? Yea thats not acceptable, not for any game.

You can listen to the people who say its early access, but to me that just gives companies like microsoft who have the capital to put out a completed game reasons to not complete a game because they know the cash will flow in regardless.

- Regular working coop mode unavailable.
- Very good game optimization.
- Incomplete and average story line (because of EA)
- Textures glitching required polishing (because of EA)
- Ants/Bugs attacking/walking through walls (because of EA)
- Spiders able to kill you through walls while you are hiding in aluminium can (because of EA)
- Food/Water consumption required small balance but more or less ok (because of EA)
- Lady Bug can pass through all you base walls and kill you in 2 hits. Base walls remain undamaged (because of EA)
- Backpack falls in texture after death (happens 3 times in different map spots) (because of EA)
- Weapon damage / Mob HP - kinda joke. Looks like all this figures scripted in game randomly without any sense. (Most probably because of EA)

- No character creation available. You have to choose between 4 available teens.
- Base structures/modules glitching after game restart (because of EA).
- Combat with mobs is annoying. If you take a break for 2-3 seconds just to take better spot for fighting Lady bug is out of combat with fully regenerated HP (because of EA? hope so)

I have crafted a number of ""tiers"" of armor each one as awesome as the next. I was still finding new materials to craft with 10 hours in. If you take the time to explore you can see how big a play area the devs plan this to be. Some areas are taped off, but the yard is going to be much bigger than it is now. There are story elements scattered around and I look forward to that part of the game being expanded. Until then I'm off to finish crafting my lady bug armor, expanding my base, and look forward to putting in many more hours. The future of this game is bright.

The menus are a little clunky, but once you get used to you find some hidden intuitive features. The main reason I wanted to play this game was the cross-platform coop with my Xbox friends. The coop itself is a blast, working together to defend your base from larvae attacks is exhilarating. As some have mentioned the story mode is only about an hour max, but that does not mean there is nothing to do because as with most survival games the focus is on surviving and upgrading your items.

Pros:
Great Coop fun
Crossplay with Xbox 
Awesome environments that make you feel like you are in Bugs Life or Honey I Shrunk the Kids\
Cool 80's style music.
Good Voice acting
Very small game, not a 180GB install like Ark.

Cons: 
Menus are clunky at times
Co-op is a host-based game, so if the host is not online you can't play. (Would like to see a No Mans Sky approach to Co-op)
Some base building glitches

Overall this is a pretty solid early access game, there is always going to be room for improvements and I hope over time we get small updates adding more gear, items, and story.

The gameplay is  very  fun for me.
It is  a very immersive game, taking me back to childhood imagination.
I get the fact that it is  early access and some stuff is glitchy. 
However I have a strong problem with multiplayer  with friends. The fact that i have to sign in to xbox live and invite my friend to a group to play is really awful. one because the xbox live app is very unstable . 2 it will kick you out randomly . 3 I wanna see an invite option inside the game not outside in the xbox live that is not good design it has extra steps for no reason and the games stills Bugs because of how unstable the xbox live app feels.
On the other hand, the bow animation could use some fixing too just a little, oh and also the bow takes a little too much of screen space and it is hard to aim at enemies at times. 
Besides that God Damn i love the gameplay this such a  cute game with cringy ass characters.  Very relatable for when i was a kid. Also I play this with a friend that hates bugs and is very funny to see him run away while ranting on how disgusting they are lmao.

Beautiful game that really nailed the “you being tiny in the world” feeling. It mixes a bit of humor, exploration and survival with a touch of horror, especially if you are uneasy around bugs. The building system is well made, and the resource grinding is more about exploration than grinding the resources.
It runs very smoothly but I had a few hard crashes. The autosaves makes it not so bad to catch up on your loss (suspecting the autosaves to crash the game but it will surely get fixed at some point). At this stage of the game, there is very little story to follow, just enough to layout the intro but there is much to explore and many area offer a good challenge (the feeling when you kill your first spider …. Awesome).
So, if you are looking for a story driven game, I would wait a bit before you get it. If you want to encourage the devs, explore that new sandbox and not (too much) afraid of insects, I would recommend it.

Bugs that I am talking about:
- Sometimes insects get through walls! Way I got through it is to create a fence around my building for extra layers.
- Planks and other building materials can alter your movement and cause you to turn. They also fly all over the place when a giant insect walks over them. Not sure if intended!
- Some insects, alike the big spider ones, can slap you through walls. Again, not sure if intended!
- Item drops and arrows can get stuck under clay structures, making you have to recycle them to get to the goodies.
- Drinking water(specifically) from the ""Canteen"" item, does decrease thirst. Works for juices, however.

That are all the bugs I have experienced so far.

Suggestions to the devs:
- Would be nice to be able to easily see above water when swimming atop of it.
- Not sure what some of the base buildings can be used for (scaffold, inner corner roof)
- Add more triangular shaped walls as rotating the existing one cannot fit in all triangular shaped holes.

64,73513343,english,"I have to write this review for all those bad reviews that are not true. 

Firstly anyone who says they completed the story is lying. The first initial quest does take maybe 30 mins if you focus on it but that is NOT the complete story and just the tutorial. You have to collect better resources and kill stronger bugs to be able to unlock more areas where you will find more quests and learn more about the story. This all requires better tier tools that requires time to get.

Secondly those who are saying multiplayer does not work is also lying. Currently there is no way to join other servers but you can join your friends who host a multiplayer game. You must do this through Xbox friend list which is free to make an account and join them that way. This Is not ideal and with time I see it being fixed however being an early access we are lucky we have multiplayer. Also note there is in game voice chat which again is lucky to have for a early access game. 

If either of those reasons are holding you back from getting the game, don't let it. There is a lot of game play for being a early access game. I have 7 hours on the game and have yet to scratch the surface it seems with so many hidden quests and mysterious doors that you need to find a way to open. Also remember this is a early access game so the game will not run as a full released game and there will be more content added guaranteed. If you can get a couple of friends to play the game with you then it will be even better and much more enjoyable.",1596115414,1596115414,True,152,6,0.831524312496185303,7,True,False,True,76561198066092226,35,2,1760,0,440,1596424597
65,73431736,english,"Had to change it to a thumbs down, simply can't recommend this game in it's current state.

I love these kind of survival and base building games.
The game already does a lot of things right. The setting is insanely creative and fresh BUT there are still a lot of bugs... lmao
The Spiders and worker ants feel incredibly punishing if not outright unbeatable if they don't bug.
Correction, Spiders are currently pretty unfun. Sure they should be punishing dangerous juggernauts, but the aggro resets feel bad sometimes.
Base destruction might be too punishing, enemies literally destroy EVERYTHING you can built.
I played The Forest with base destruction turned off because it was just too frustrating and i spent too much time investing in creative ways to build an amazing base.

The story that is in the game so far took us 80 minutes with base building, it can probably be done in like 10-20 minutes and is more of an intro if anything. You can get an idea of what the game is supposed to be. But not knowing that was a BIG slap in the face when you see the popup telling you the story is already done for the moment.

My biggest concern so far is the crafting interface though, it feels very clunky and annoying to use, you have to go full screen and click through menus. The crafting itself feels slow and unintuitive.

1. the theme of the game is fantastic!
2. the graphics are top notch!
3. the game itself is really fun if you like sandbox crafting games with light survival mechanics
4. different armor types made from different enemies
5. the map is interesting  and fun to explore!

meh:
1. base building is passable but options are a little restricting as of right now and sometimes the walls dont wanna snap together
2. combat is passable, its not bad at all, but there isnt much strategy to it. it would be cool to see different types of attack patterns, or techniques.
3. kinda hit a soft cap when you need stuff from ladybugs and harder enemies, but i would expect that a good group of 4 with good gear could take them out, however, alone, its very difficult.
4. the story was very short, but i put that in this category and not the BAD category for 2 reasons. firstly, they will add to the story in time. its early access. secondly, this is a crafting game and the story is not the main reason to play.

BAD: TOO MANY BUGS (lol not the creepy crawly kind) 

the game has crashed at least a dozen times on me, which is doubly annoying when im hosting. 

encountered a game breaking bug that made the in game time stop passing, so i couldnt research, sleep, was stuck at 6AM with almost no light, my torch had infinite health, because the game thought time was not passing, my food would not cook because no time was passing etc.

a few little bugs like, water droplets and aphids floating after i chop down the grass they were on but those bugs are actually kinda funny to me.

OVERALL: i was super hyped for this game before and im still super hyped for it now. the game is great, ill just say that, but i want them to fix the bugs, especially the game crashes. i would like more content added. im more concerned with more things to craft and more enemies/weapons/resources etc.. but more story missions would be cool too! :)

5,73490432,english,"Ok, so after about 15 hours or so in the game i can say that the foundation for this game is very strong. As a survival game fan, have enjoyed most my time in game. The idea is brilliant. Like Ark, it sets itself apart from competitors by not going the zombie route wich is AWESOME. 

Grounded has the same problem all survival games has with AI, which is that they are easily exploitable. Big scary spider? No problem, find a nice rock to stand on and blast it with arrows while it stares at you. this works with any enemy and leaves alittle to be desired as the game almost forces you to take this route due to the simple fact that aggressive insects do ALOT of damage. A combat roll would do wonders here. 

A good survival game has a crafting system too match and Gounded does excellent in this area. Akin to Monster Hunter, you craft almost all your armor and weapons out of the parts of insects you have slain. This leads to cool looking gear and each set of gear gives you perks that can increase health, stamina, block, hauling capacity and ability to wander in the Haze area. its this aspect wich also breeds excitement to what future insects they might add like grasshopper (increased jump height?), mosquitos, bees/wasps (wich have lootable armor already), Mantis ect. this lends itslef with the opportunity for cool weapons, armor and other crafting goods, wich is one of the key corner stones for a good survival game.

The map is somewhat interesting, offering a whole new perspective and scale to the average back yard and making it feel like a entirely new world. there arnt many biomes as of now and some feel a bit underwhelming, the hedge area is really cool with a sprawling upper section of branches to explore, while the floor level is a bit...meh. The haze area did not feel as dangerous as i think it could be. and pretty barren overall except for 1 enemy type that was kind of just an afterthought compared to all the other insects. there is a big oak tree wich players will need to travel to in order to progress the small bit of story that is avialable and this area feels really cool and populated but various insects. Then there is some nice marshy areas that were created by leaky sprinklers wich was a very nice touch. there are also a few areas wich are marked as ""under construction"", fairly large in size and hope to see some new things that are not already present on the map be added. 

Things you used to walk on and swat away are now all (mostly) predators. From the fierce warrior ants, annoying gnats that constantly bump into you, to huge spiders you can see swaying the tops of grass forest in from a distance as they search for their next unlucky victim. there are a few others that i wont completely spoil with new ones in the works aswell, so i look foward to those. 

Overall, if you are a survival fan that doesnt mind there not being any pvp, i would say give it a try. if you dont like it in the first 2hrs just get your refund. but i think this game holds a huge amount of potential, aswell as having a damn good solid base to build off of. there not much story as of yet so im not going to make any remarks on that front, but it is an Obsidian game, so i trust they will have something good in store on that front.",1596070117,1596099509,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True,76561199032523138,34,9,2506,0,855,1599552716

10,73495880,english,"[h1] Grounded [/h1]

[u] ** Early Access Review ** [/u]

Grounded is a unique gaming idea that follows up-to four teenagers as they survive, and explore the backyard of a house. They have been shrunk down to ""Ant"" size randomly and there seems to be some scientific explanation as to why this has happened. This is where the story mode comes in, and you must keep in mind that this game is Early Access as the story stops [spoiler] after you speak to the robot in the laboratory [/spoiler].  This realistically took me 45 minutes to figure out and get to as it's not that far into the game. 

The game prides itself on survival; meaning crafting, building and fighting to survive your common insects (Ladybugs, Spiders, Nats etc). Other than the concept of the game (which is what pulls you into the game) it is very similar to The Forest when comparing survival aspects. Find water, food and craft structures to make your survival easier, and more comfortable while avoiding specific insects. 

Pros: 
+Concept
+Graphically enticing 
+Smooth gameplay (so far)
+Arachnophobia Mode (If you have this you will be glad this setting was implemented)
+Text to Speech (Accessibility option for users that utilize Narrator)
+Story has promise and potential
+Survival aspects were thought out (Drinking water from droplets and drinking dirty water is bad for you etc)
+Crafting abilities are easy and straightforward
+Need to discover uses for things using Science
+Developers seem to be very open to criticism and direction for the game


Cons:
-Voice acting is atrocious, and are cringe
-Character depth is lacking
-Other than the story the game is extremely shallow (at the moment)
-The price of $29.99 (This game is Early Access, yes) This game is easily $14.99 or [i] maybe [/i] $19.99
-No Skill Tree 
-Larger insects are insanely difficult 


It's hard to place a recommendation on this game as it's not finished but the game shows promise. I will place it down as Recommended because you're paying of the development of the game and it has tremendous potential. It's tough with a price of $29.99 but at this moment the game is [b] not [/b] worth the asking price.",1596080899,1596097643,True,5,0,0.550067722797393799,4,True,False,True,76561198050616089,555,25,184,0,97,1596095517

The 'story' as it is right now is pretty non-existent, and you can 'beat' the main story in like ten or twenty minutes if you know what to look for/where to go. The yard, however, is sprawling and there's a ton of other stuff to see and do, plenty of bugs to fight, and enough grubs to make Timon and Pumbaa swoon.

There's also an 'arachnophobia' slider, and while I don't use it I do think it's worth noting for those of you who don't like our eight legged friends. You also need an X-Box Live account to access the multiplayer aspect of the game, but signing up for that is free and really isn't that much of a big deal, and if you're like me and are only really interested in the single-player, you don't need to worry about X-Box Live at all.

With over 2k hours between ark, conan, rust, 7days, etc - all the big survival games this is comparable to. I believe I'm well placed to place an accurate review. 

Pixar-esc graphics, childish character models, and cheesy dialogue seems to be a strange design choice in a game which is as truly terrifying as this. This differs to its competitors by having no PVP I'm aware of at this stage, but it's the only game I can recall that made me scream out loud. If your arachniphobic (and an adult) just roll with the game as it's designed, even with its seemingly childish art style it is genuinely terrifying, and full of flavour, and after 10 mins the design manages to walk the fine line and come across as rather endearing. I hope the story gets expanded on quickly as 30-60 mins of content actually got me invested which is impressive in a game like this. But as with all survival games, the main content is in just that, survival.

I can honestly say this seems more polished than any of its main competitors after years of development on day one of its EA.

anyway that aside, my friends and i can play co-op, it works just fine. we get enough biomes for current price so bugs can be squished (figuratively and literally).

arrow lines up weirdly sometimes but it works fine after getting used to---needs tweaking in animation, perhaps.
ants/bugs still get stuck in your stuff if there are no walls (as to be expected, playing witcher and having roach get stuck in areas where normally she shouldn't, this is nothing)
maybe there could be more settings to make the survival mode, harder. like, having multipliers scale up and down, would be great. (this insight coming from playing another survival game that's been on early access....since forever...)

18,73501309,english,"This game is a survival game. Think of ""Honey I Shrunk the kids in an Ark/Forest (no cannibals just big ass spiders) style way of surviving.  The one con I have is Grounded has very little to offer in the way of a story at the moment.  However, it does give promises of expanding and learning more of a story line in the future.

Now the survival aspect. 
This game is a survival game.  If you want to build, survive, and explore with very few 'quests' then this is it!
The art in the game is beautiful.  It truly makes you feel TINY and in a backyard while looking up at grass blades that have water droplets on them for you to drink from. The detail of the game is amazing.  
You wake up to have been shrunk somehow and have to figure out why.  
You collect resources on the ground just like Ark and Forest.  Instead of cutting down trees, you cut down blades of grass.  You collect everything and analyze it at least once.  One item analyzed can learn you one or more recipes.   A few analyzing stations are scattered on the map (the map is huge).   You build your base with leaves, and weed stems from dandelions to name a few.   You can jump from grass blade to grass blade exploring, but watch out for the moving grass in the distance or near by.  Seriously!  Orb weavers and Wolf spiders galore.  If you have arachnophobia, the game has a sliding switch for that. It allows you to have the spiders not be so.....spidery. Staring up at a wolf spider while running under leaves in a backyard is a bit unsettling for my household when I screamed not once, but twice.  
Grounded is family friendly. If you are wanting to play with your children there isn't any need to worry other than the spiders could be a bit scary.  The wolf spider lurching out in the dark tunnels with you holding a torch is no fun! holy crap! I literally almost crapped!  

Advice for just starting:
The ants are friendly until you attack one.  Attack them in pairs or less if you are by yourself.   
Set markers up as you go until you memorize your surrounding, 
craft lean to's or hit escape and save VERY FREQUENTLY, 
ants will steal your food.
Have fun!  PTSD from spiders engaged.

- Looks Great
- Awesome Concept
- Fun mechanics and combat

Cons
- Currently, the story is incredibly short, and only offers a few hours of play-time
- Multiplayer must be done through Xbox live which is not convenient and involves creating another account
- Graphics seem to be poorly optimized, there is no ability to finely tune individual settings, and the preset graphics settings don't seem to make much of a difference in terms of FPS.

* Naturally, this is an EA game, and like it/hate it, that's how some games are made today. Do I wish I had loads more stuff to play with? You bet! Yet I've also played (and enjoyed!) games like Escape from Tarkov and Rust, just to name some 'EA' games. I like the feeling of knowing more new stuff will come in, but that's me!

* Again, EA game, so expect bugs and issues. And issues with the bugs, if you'll pardon a pun. Yet that's what you're supposed to do as you play: Call out the issues and get them fixed! Again, like it/hate it, part of an EA game, get with it.

* Content? LOADS of stuff. Sure, you could make the argument 'but there's like not enough to warrant full price', and you may have a point! But I've been working on finding just ONE Point-of-Interest for the last two days, and I'm excited to both find it, and find ever more stuff: because there is FAR more than what meets the eye here.

* Keep in mind, all of my words are just from a solo player: I highly expect this game to be even better with people! Sure, you may not like the 'Microsoft Account' detail needed from MP, and I can agree, I'd like some more Steam love. Yet if your PC has Windows, chances are you have a MicroAccount, so hush!

85,73492760,english,"Launch impressions: This game is neat, but it's what I think of as a ""polished early access."" What's included is good: the core gameplay seems to be mostly there with a large number of craftables and materials, and the visuals and art are very nice, but there basically is no story at this time (half characters don't even seem to have any dialog recorded yet) and it has a fair number of bugs and balance issues and could use some work on interface.  The survival aspects of the game are fairly light on medium difficulty, with food and water being pretty much everywhere and the only death penalty being a dropped inventory which you can run back to and pick up. Basically right now you can explore the map and build a nice base, but have no particular gameplay reason or story motivation given to do so. 

I don't have any reason not to recommend it with the caveat that the $30  price tag is pretty high for what's on offer right now. That said, it seems about right for what I'd expect the game to become when it's nearer to completion, so be aware that if you're not going to wait for a sale or the game to be ready then you're basically paying extra to get an early look.",1596074763,1596074763,True,3,0,0.547325074672698975,0,True,False,True,76561197969946776,376,7,151,0,123,1597547391
86,73492681,english,"Wow, I'm impressed!  The graphics and smooth gameplay would not indicate this is an Early Access title.  My laptop isn't a high-end gaming rig but it's handling everything well, and even the lowest graphical settings look really, REALLY good.  In my 5+ hours of play I have had zero crashes and zero glitches, at least not anything I would notice as a glitch.  

There is very little story so far, but the devs have said that will be implemented later.  Honestly I think tht's a good idea, because I'd hate to get involved with a story so riddled with errors and crashes that I couldn't play. Right now after you make a huge discovery, the story ends and there are only a series of daily missions.  I'm using the dailies to familiarize myself with the landscape and the wildlife, and gathering resources to build a base.  The world itself is very fully fleshed out with a variety of insects already, and more to come.  There are several distinct biomes within a single back yard, and as an entomology nerd I'm really enjoying seeing the diversity and actions of the various bugs.  I haven't heard anything on the subject, but being able to tame some of the neutral insects would be really fun in the future.  

Crafting is fairly intuitive, and a lot of the things you can make area really creative, like the acorn armor pieces. Every new resource opens up even more crafting options, and there are a LOT of resources!

Pros - 
Well made and satisfying mechanics like perfect blocking and armor that has unique effects
great accessibility options (especially for arachnophobia, and even though I have very bad arachnophobia I enjoy the spiders in this game)
A forest like system for logs/building, so you can plan out buildings and your friends can also do it with you
Enjoyable in multiplayer and doesn't feel unfair when it comes to PvE

Cons - which are inevitable but this is also a list of things that either I don't like for a game or bugs that I would love to see gone when the game gets more updated
Xbox multiplayer only. My friends and I all have microsoft accounts, we just launched from steam and he saw my host available to join, no problems there
one very annoying problem is that everytime we reload the world we have to reset our settings (notable ones being motion blur, mics being disable ingame, and subtitles size) 
can't think of anything majorly irritating or any problems besides that, will update review if I find new stuff I like/don't like, bugs, etc.

Why?
it Is just great to be tiny :D



Yes the story/tutorial part 1. is over fast.. BUT...
There's more to figure out! 
Sure you can build and go kill bugs after part 1 and be happy or say it is like Ark...

Or find you friend in the grass forest claiming that his is standing on a hill until the sun rises and he realising that he is on top of  a head from a broken toy.


It ain't easy to survive out there and that is what makes it so rewarding when you arrive somewhere you didn't expect.
So bring your friends along or go by your self.

If you want more of the story then please go and explore the world there are a lot of hidden locations and moments were you get surprised of the scale of trash in nature. 

In Grounded one mans trash is a other mans treasure! 
I have seen some Dark stuff in that backyard too it is not so cute as people say...

Sure there is base building and survival. but exploring the world and adapting to being tiny and live with natures law is a really nice experience. I love the ants and respect the spider.
Base building games are popular. But i thing that exploration and adventure is the best part of the game.

My 1st and only tip of the day: Spiders can be good to have around when something larger comes into your territory. 
:D

Good luck and happy gaming.

14,73436265,english,"Updating this review. Initially, I didn't recommend this game, because I felt the issues with the game would turn away the average player. After spending some more time in the game, I still feel that the average gamer may get frustrated with some of the issues, but I'd still recommend players to pick it up and try it out. Just bear in mind that the game is very much an early access game.

Pros:
-The Base Building aspect of the game is fun. I'd like more customization, but the community has already made some really cool designs with what they've been given.
-Co-op worked fine (I know others were having issues). I've had a few errors with friends being able to connect to my game, but they were able to get in eventually
-The concept is EXTREMELY fun. It's like ""Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"" meets ""A Bugs Life"".
-The graphics feel very polished and the art style matches the theme of the game well.
-The bugs are absolutely terrifying. I've jumped out of my chair no less than 5 times playing this so far
-The crafting system is incredibly in depth already

Cons:
-A Microsoft account is required to play
-The walls and doors often have a hard time aligning or being placed on certain terrain, unless they're attached to a floor. If you didn't have to spend raw science to research the floors, it wouldn't be as much of an issue, but I also don't want to have to build floors to be able to reliable place walls.
-The bugs (especially soldier ants) are way overtuned. The soldier ants will go on a rampage at night and destroy EVERYTHING you've built, even on the medium difficulty.
-There's a noticeable lack of content in the game. The ""main story"" took me all of 15 minutes to complete. While this is a sandbox game and the creative aspects give you plenty to do, the story could have been fleshed out A LOT more (even for early access).
-Character selection seemed to make no difference, other than which voice lines you are forced to hear over and over throughout your play through. Having the characters make a choice would have been a nice touch
-There's no character progression. Having some skills would give you some agency, which would feel much better from a role playing perspective.",1595974089,1596068564,True,2,0,0.518481194972991943,2,True,False,True,76561198077817004,175,16,1777,0,288,1596082156

22,73488972,english,"This is the first review I have ever made and I'm only leaving it due to reading so many hate comments about this game and the small things they complain about. First off, the game is ""Early Access"", meaning... well...it's not finished. It's going to have some bugs (ha pun not intended) and obviously not all of the content is there yet. Yeah the story only takes about 20 min to complete up to the point the content is over but it's only just begun. Hell, for one, it has a story. ""7 Days to Die"", although I love this game as well, has absolutely no story to speak of because it doesn't really need it. I would still play Grounded without a story so I'm just happy it has one.  The thrill of exploring is immense in my opinion as you have to be constantly aware of your surroundings. I've also never had a game scare me worse in my entire life, and I've played plenty of horror games. Having a wolf spider the size of a tank charging at me at full speed will haunt me for the rest of my life, and I love it. I love the sense of scale and how small you feel, hell gnat's are the size of your head. The gameplay and crafting mechanics reminds me of ""The Forest"" which I'm all about. I also appreciate how fresh this game feels, your enemies aren't zombies or cannibals like most survival craft games are.

25,73488826,english,"     I want to start this review by saying IT IS EARLY ACCESS. In all honesty, don't buy this game until there is more content. I would wait maybe 6 months, i'm sure (hoping) there will be more content by then. With that being said let's move on. The graphics for this game are absolutely stunning. I find myself frequently climbing to high places just to look around and enjoy the view. This game is gorgeous. The sound design is amazing and I am surprised to not see many people talking about it. You can tell, what enemy is nearby just based on the sounds alone. That mixed with really good ambient noises that really make the world seem alive. From dogs barking, to cars driving by. Heck, even the sound of someone mowing their lawn. The sound design of this game is amazing, and I cannot stress that enough. The story for this game is well... horribly unfinished. Which is to be expected of course. However, what we do have is a REALLY cool concept and something very interesting to be sure. Think of The Forest, which is probably the game closest to this one. The Forest has you surviving until you're prepared enough to uncover the secrets of the island. This game is practically the exact same thing. The creature design in this game is pretty good. I think in terms of enemies where this game REALLY shines is the large spiders. Spiders walk around and move the ""giant"" blades of grass that don't even jiggle if you walk on them. They give away their position with this detail but also blend in very well into the environment. This is the perfect mix of ominous, terrifying, and downright exciting. Seeing large enemies is always fun and gets my heart pumping. Overall this game has the most potential I've seen in a video game of this style in quite some time. I give this game a solid 7/10 and I am very sure Obsidian will not let me down once they have a more finished product. I look forward to exploring this game more and more with each update. As a final note, there is a ton of world for you to explore and enjoy the scenery. Just because the story of the game ends quickly without much content doesn't mean you can't run around and enjoy what there is to see and find. There's more to the game than the negative reviews would have you believe.",1596066760,1596066760,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True,76561198046497686,119,4,1702,0,300,1598589105

Yes there are annoying issues, like when you get flooring until later, you think it should be unlocked when you unlock walls, weird, but being early access hopefully they will change it.

Good size map, tonnes of exploration, building mechanics are good, graphics are very suitable for setting i think. Getting resources for anything that requires wood is grueling until you get your upgraded axe and then you still got to find your wood. Would be good if you could plant your own weeds for the wood.

But overall, 9/10 for early access, no crashing and runs beautifully. 2/10 for story since there is virtually none, but has potential to be interesting, Building experience would be a 7/10, tweeks needed in all aspects to make it more enjoyable. Overall enjoyment would be 10/10 for me. Worthy game. Haven't tried multiplayer yet. So not giving that a rating.

The story is very short right now, and that is mentioned pretty clearly in the early access details. For a team of what we were told is 13 people, this game is promising. I feel like complaining about an early access title not having answers to all the issues a day after launch is really just a sign that you should not pay for early access. I got 5 hours out of my first play session with friends, and expect to sink at least another 20-30 hours on what is offered currently. You do need an Xbox live account, but you do not pay for any membership (seen this mentioned too many times) and setting up multiplayer is as easy as being friends on those accounts and joining your friends lobby once it is up.

55,73484700,english,"it's crazy good fun (especially with friends) and will be more so if [spoiler]spider aggro is tuned down and[/spoiler] the volume of content is increased.  

Neither I nor my friends have experienced any kind of connectivity issues so I can't speak to other's experiences. For us, the networking has been rock solid with the party easily able to find the host.  The world is amazing. The sound design is great.  The depth of field, textures, mechanics all spot on. There's fun little things here and there that make perfect sense and add a delightful bit of whimsy -- things that you'd expect of a [i]complete[/i] game, but sadly it is not.  If you seek out the video ""How Obsidian Created Grounded"" it concludes with their desire to work with the community to build it out and if that's legitimate... ok. My fear, however, is that the team that built it will be re-tasked now that art assets, game mechanics, sound, etc. appear to be in the bag.

Now for the less good things.  Buying what amounts to a ported XBox game through Steam does require that you log into your XBox live account within the game in a fairly clumsy way (web iframe in the middle of the game menu).  It's especially painful if you use a password manager (lastpass, 1password, dashlane, etc.) and have to transcribe a password.  The game can get into this weird state where if you type an ""a"" as part of your credentials, it opens audio options. I'll admit that had me seeing red.  Once you bind it to your XBox live account it seems to remember it and it's not an on-going hassle, but it's not as clean as you'd like.  Therefore, it [i]may[/i] -- and I hesitate to suggest it -- be better buying the game through the Microsoft Xbox app thingy than Steam.  Personally, I'm glad I and the majority of my friends bought through Steam because you get a centralized view of their activity, achievements, etc. but you can decide how important that is to you.   

There's also a lack of content.  The game world is much larger than I have explored, so I'm sure there are things to find and enemies to encounter and areas of the world to experience, etc.  That is all ""content"" but that's not the content I'm referring to.  There's some guided tasks that you are [i]suggested[/i] to do to understand the larger plot and if you do that it'll end fairly quickly/abruptly.  You can continue to open world it, but it's jarring to be invested in a story, making what feels like progress and have it conclude as it does. If you were an early purchaser of Sea of Thieves you'll be familiar with a similar experience.  That's an unfair comparison because SoT was sold as a complete game and commanded a complete game's price and after about an hour you realized you'd seen and done everything that was on offer.  The experience with Grounded isn't that and yet it kind of is...  

Grounded is not sold as SoT was sold nor is it marketed as SoT was marketed nor are you charged for a complete game -- so keep reminding yourself of that.  The problem with both titles is that they're stable and beautiful and immersive and care has been put into what you'd think should be finishing touches and yet neither title was in a finished state and when you discover that it's deflating.  You have my attention [b]now[/b]!  In 3 months or in 6 months when the content gets expanded I don't know that I'll be able to convince people to give it a second look or to re-grind aspects of the story.  

In the end, that ""negative"" leads to the highest compliment I can give it... I want to be a consumer of the final product and that's not what they're offering.",1596058970,1596058970,True,1,0,0.504132270812988281,0,True,False,True,76561197976406166,284,1,1258,0,437,1598595858

Here is a list of things i hope to see in the future:
-All bugs drop meat (for consistency because it doesn't make sense for some bugs to drop meat and some to not)
-More creatures (ex. Bees, Butterflies, Dragonflies, Wasps, Grasshoppers, Crickets, Black Widows, Mosquitoes etc.)
Weather:
-Rain (collectible and drinkable)
-Snow
-Thunderstorm
-Drought
Seasons:
-Spring (Plants start growing back and bugs start coming back from winter, rain is more common, dewdrops on grass are more common)
-Summer (Number of bugs peak and they are at their strongest, crops/plants grow faster, longer days, shorter nights)
-Fall (Tree leaves start changing colors, grass starts dying and changing colors, long nights short days)
-Winter (Water freezes and snow can be used as a water source but must be melted down over a fire, All bugs are more scarce and less active except spiders and crickets, most grass and plants are dead or frozen and can be found easier underground, food is overall hard to find and must be stored and saved in preparation for winter, longer nights shorter days)
-A temperature mechanic
-More caves
-Sand
-Most resources convertible into raw science
-Technological advancements bought from BURG.L (Vehicles, Concrete (or some type of durable building material), Saddles which can be used to ride flying passive insects like butterflies, etc.)

67,73483360,english,"I'll get right to the point:

This game is adorable and crazy fun. Discovering the different insects, friendly or not, and learning the ecosystem ""rules"" and the consequences you face for disturbing them is amazing and different. The fact that you can go from ""wow this game is beautiful"" to ""HOLY $&!# THERES A SPIDER BEHIND ME OMG I JUST PISSED MY SELF"" in less the 0.1 seconds is exactly what I want from this game. This game is like Raft and The Forest had a baby. There's story based objectives with a cute art style like Raft, and scary enemies with difficult survival like The Forest. I HIGHLY recommend this game.

If you've been reading negative reviews for this game, here's a few things I want to say about them:

-Most of them played less than an hour and gave up. 
-They hold the Obsidian name up too high- this is a passion project for them, not another fallout series. They wont be the same game, so accept that.
-This game is early access, and WILL have bugs, issues, and limited content. That's just part of buying an early access game, and if you felt upset by that you never should've bought an early access game.
-All bugs I had while playing 9 hours of CoOp were easily fixed with disconnecting and reconnecting. Nothing was game breaking. I only crashed twice in 9 hours and reconnected easily with no progress lost. So I'm happy with that
-You need a Microsoft account to play NOT A XBOX LIVE ACCOUNT. It's quick and easy and FREE to make one, and I feel like most people have one already.
-They rushed the story in 20 minutes and then quit the game. If you only play a game for objectives, and not for exploring and creating a unique experience for yourself, I feel sorry for you. It's so much more fun that just following a dot on the screen.

I highly recommend this game, and I recommend you buy it now. It's $30 and I can see how amazing this game is going to become as it grows and expands with feedback. The story is already so interesting and mysterious, the environment and insects are unique, beautiful and terrifying. I'm happy with the time I spent already and plan on playing more tonight with my friends. This game will easily become $60 on full release so I'm happy with paying $30 now with a few bugs and a short story in exchange for the excitement for every new update until full release and saving money with it.

Take negative reviews with a grain of salt because if they steer you away from this amazing game, you'll be missing out.

71,73482686,english,"I really want to like this game. I've never enjoyed survival games, but from what I've played so far this seems to be right up my alley. The cartoonish look sells it as a much more casual game than it ends up being. You will spend a large amount of your first few days running from the spiders that, for some reason, live right next to the starting area. They can spot you from a long ways away, run faster than you, and will kill you in one hit. That kind of challenge is fine if you're up for it, but I definitely am not, and these guys are just as dangerous on the easiest difficulty. The (very thoughtful) arachnophobia slider is a really neat tool to make them less scary, but it does absolutely nothing to make them less dangerous, so I'm just as afraid of them as before.

After a couple of tries on easy mode, I just switched to creative mode to explore through the story without constant threats. Unfortunately, everything about the story seems to be disabled in creative mode, so if I want to actually experience this game, I have no choice but to confront those horrible, horrible spiders.

Game is packed with detail from the crafting to the animations when bugs are moving through the grass. The ants are little thieves, the research and decorative items are a nice touch. The spiders and other big bugs give you quite a bit of sudden danger depending on the area, seeing aphids scurrying around and running up leaves is a joy too.

It took me a good bit to get multiplayer working which seemed to be a combination of the xbox services on pc, my antivirus and some registry key that was stuck. They have a discord setup and are trying to sort out bugs effectively.

The game itself runs smooth and gameplay is fun. Menus are well designed and POIs are fun to uncover their purpose. There is a strong focus on multi-player and teamwork.

Unlike the advertisements and youtube promo-plays, some very important key features are missing or hard to navigate and access. For $30 and no EA discount, there is no steam multiplayer implemented at the moment, it must all be done through xbox friend list, which is a pain for many PC steam gamers who may have expected the ease of steam connect. You NEED an xbox/microsoft account if you wish to play multiplayer. This obstacle keeps customers from 'the time that they could be playing the product' with friends (aka. additional customers) Hopefully this changes and hopefully we see another map or additional story quests.

Other than that, Grounded is a game that seems like it will grow into its potential through the dev process.  It already looks great and plays smoothly.  I would sooner compare this one to Subnautica than to Ark.  Ark was over-hyped rubbish that never managed to deliver on its promise.  Subnautica started out a bit rough, but eventually the underlying brilliance of its design shone through.  Hopefully, once they iron out a few kinks and fill in the story content, Grounded will be more like that.  I think it's already super fun, and I'm looking forward to jumping into a new playthrough soon.

Note:  I played single-player, offline.  I have no comments about the multiplayer, which seems to be the main source of bad reviews so far.  I think that's unfortunate, because Grounded is getting a mixed welcome, even though the problem doesn't really have anything to do with gameplay or design decisions pertaining to the experience itself.

There's aboslutely no reason Microsoft/Obsidian couldn't have left this in the oven longer to release a finished product as opposed to Early Access.

In it's current state, Grounded is just another unfinished survival crafting game. It was barely advertised as such, and many people are validly disappointed. As of right now the dev's claim 20% of the story is in game, that amounts to a short, near uneventful tutorial that ends abruptly, leaving you with nothing but building and generic generated quests.

What's here is entirely dependent on how much you like building and doing ""kill x bug x times"" quests over and over. A coop experience might help curb the boredom but that isn't enough to validate the current price. They even plan to increase the price so it makes the expectations even higher. 

Do not forget this is not some indie dev, this is Microsoft and Obsidian, both entities have been producing/developing games for decades which makes the current state of this game inexcusable.

Yes, it's Early Access, so expect this to be developed slowly over time as is the theme with this Genre of games, but that's also my gripe... it's TOO early access.  There's maybe about 25 minutes worth of content in a $40 title.  This should have been a free demo in it's current form, if I'm honest.  
Am I upset I adopted this early?  Maybe a little?  If it was sloppier, I would have happily refunded this within Steam's time limit, but I can see the potential, so I guess it will sit in my library over the next year while I keep a side-glanced eye on it's development.

This game is something you'd except more from, but don't get yet.. Imo it's really still the skeleton of the game and the way it feels, the way it's played etc. which is very logical since it's still in Early Access. 

[b] Building - Meh[/b]
While it seems really simple, it is really not. They throw recipes your way like walls, windows and roofs pretty early in the game. You've probably seen it a lot in the discussion tab or even in the bug report [b] I can't make floors [/b] even though it's there.. You just have to unlock it by finishing the 20 minute story and unlocking it by spending knowledge points.
Which imo... Is a really weird take.. Why would you be ablle to make a straight sturdy wall and not a FLOOR that's litterally 4 leaves laying on a FLAT surface..

65,73473302,english,"Game is definitely early access, so lets give some feedback. 

First, I love the environment, I'm getting mad nostalgic for my Pikmin days. So exploring is really fun.

After that stuff starts to really need work. I'm playing on normal and base defense is not fun at all. I keep getting attacked by like 5 or 6 larva at once, which is way more than two people can handle for 2 reasons. Reason 1, the main way you make your base more sturdy is with weed stems. There really aren't enough of these around, so building is a massive chore, unless you want to build out of grass, and the grass is basically useless as a fortification. The game keeps reminding me to block, but that isn't the issue when I'm being attacked by four larva from four different angles now is it? So I gave up on base building entirely and put all the necessary base items on top of a rock plateau and now that part of the game doesn't suck. 

Part of what makes base defense so bad is how weak the weapons are, you basically must get a weapon better than the first tier of weapons before you make a base if you want any chance. Ontop of that, base building wouldn't be so bad if I could get a tier 2 ax so I could chop down the large weeds, but I have no idea how. I've scanned every single new item I've found after a day a playing and not one of them has given me the recipe for the next tier of ax. Game really struggles with conveyance in that regard. 

The final reason base defense sucks is the bow is unbelievably weak. If you are getting swarmed, naturally you want to take to high ground and use arrows to solve the problem. TOO BAD, its going to take around 8 arrows per larva and like I said there's 5 or 6 of them at once. If i wasn't getting hit by larva, I was getting hit by ants despite intentionally storing no food in the base, and the soldier ants are tanky as hell, even two of them is a real problem on normal, and remember I had help. All of this kept happening before I had even errected a 2x3 with spike traps on all the walls. BEFORE I WAS DONE BUILDING, and the cherry ontop, they would attack again before I was done repairing the damage, so it's just a cycle of not making any progress on your base, and my build was a totally modest size. 

Last thing I'll mention is that multiplayer is not 100% playable right now. Crashes, failed loads, infinite loads, you name it, but solo is a way more stable option rn, which kinda sucks because I got this game to play with friends, and of my 3 friends who got it, I could only play with 1. The rest gave up on trouble shooting. 

So to conclude. Game has great potential, but the base mechanics need to be reworked BADLY. I would say don't buy this game for at least a month.",1596040840,1596040840,True,1,0,0.504999995231628418,0,True,False,True,76561198140394739,115,63,945,0,488,1598160397

The enemies aren't as tough as people make them out to be if you use the terrain to your advantage instead of trying to leeroy Jenkins them.

The story is short mainly because the game isn't finished yet as they have stated. takes about 40 minutes to complete in its current state and that's if you rush it. if you played My time at Portia like i have then you can once the story is done collect resources, build up your base and do daily quests to get more science points to unlock upgrades so you are better prepared for the updates as they come.

Pros: 

Environment; unique and pleasantly unsettling

Soundtrack: Fits the astethic of the 90's vibe the game is going for.

Gameplay: Combat is simple but efficient, crafting is easy and UI is easy to figure out. 

Story: Although brief at time of release, has a lot of potential!

Cons:

Just one really....

THE SPIDERS, OH THE SPIDERS. Listen, I am an arachnophobe by every account, and the game does indeed have options to essentially make the spiders as detailed or as non detailed (you literally can make the spider a floating grey blob with eyes), but after a few hours, although still terrifying, they are simply OP in my opinion. They are littered throughout the map, are tanks, and will detect you almost instantly. Love the idea, but as my friend said ""If they're going to be this hard to kill and avoid, they should be like running into a death claw in Fallout. Rare, but challenging. 

All in all this game is super interesting, fun to play, and provides a unique survival co-op experience. 

Would recommend highly, but just be patient with the devs.

6,73466984,english,"Probably don't get this game at it's current state. It's story time.

We tried to co-op this game with a friend and had fun for the first couple hours setting up camp and exploring, but on hour 3 our base was just flooded one night with two wolf spiders, an army of ants and a band of larvae. For the entire night and day they rapidly undid all our progress and refused to leave.

We couldn't leave camp due to the spiders standing guard right behind our walls. Once the ants came in hunting a weevil they destroyed our walls in the process letting the spiders into camp. We fled to higher ground and slept on some rocks which didn't despawn any of the bugs as we had hoped. Instead this now spawned a horde of larvae that demolished the rest of what was left of our base, destroying all storage units and scattering the physics objects within everywhere across the ground. Once we tried to kill these larvae, poking them from a distance with our spears, they would just quickly flee when they'd reach low health and another larva with full health would take it's place. By this time our characters were both dying of their wounds, hunger and thirst. At this point we just both quit the game with a disappointed sigh. This is what I imagine playing Rust on a public server is like, but now it was the game's AI doing the griefing.

Story over.

I've yet to see all the content the early access build has to offer. There is a story path you can follow, but on normal your hunger and thirst meters deplete so quickly and you die so easily that most of my focus had been on just surviving until I can craft good enough gear and gather enough resources to safely explore the next area where the game wants me to go. So far this has felt like a zero sum game where by the time you gather resources your armor breaks and once you have armor, you again lack food and drink, leaving little time to progress the story.

I've took more notes while playing to both include in this review and to use as feedback for Obsidian if anyone's reading this.

- Would've preferred Steamworks for multiplayer but the Xbox live works okay here, I guess

- The game needs more detailed graphics options, currently you can't even disable motion blur, otherwise the game runs pretty well even on an older computer

- When you wear/equip gear they still take inventory space in your backpack for some reason, Obsidian please fix

- The game's time gated recipe research station is a fun idea

- Inventory lacks a quick sort button, you can't drop stacks of one item for your friend and you can't quickly deposit items either

- You also can't ""trash"" grass planks and other large materials that aren't stored directly in your inventory so they just litter your game world once you upgrade to a better base building material

- [strike]The base building in this game is weird, you can't build a flat foundation floor for your base like in Satisfactory but walls will still forcibly snap to each other at set angles. This makes base building feel super clunky.[/strike] Turns out these are in the game, just kinda oddly communicated in the game as foundations and floors are built separately.

- There's also no global game world grid you could snap walls to so basically you can't build two separate walls for your base and have them meet up somewhere in the middle, they won't align correctly, building a base in this just feels like a weird commitment to whatever your starting point is

- You also can't build a wall if it even a little bit of it goes inside a rock or a hill, this makes it a headache to plan a base that has no holes in it for small bugs to get through.
- But it doesn't matter since your first two wall types, grass and weed, are so flimsy that any aggressive bug will go through them if they so much as sneeze at them, this makes any and all base building feel pointless since you're building a protection that doesn't do what it's supposed to do, you can even accidentally break these walls yourself for whatever reason

- Basically your base can be way too easily destroyed as described above and there isn't really a place on the map where the bugs don't travel through it daily

- You can build spike traps for the bugs that hurt them when they touch them but these can also hurt you for some reason and there's no way to tell how much damage these actually do the bugs if any

- Any building materials you aren't using will take up space, these are all poorly stacking physics objects that will be flung 500 meters into the air if so much as ant brushes them. To fix this you have to build a pallet that lets you stack them as static objects but these pallets take up a ton of space and don't actually hold many of these materials at all. It's a pain.

- The nights in this game also feel like they're way too long compared to how fast daytime goes by. You can make a bed that lets you skip nighttime but what Obsidian doesn't seem clued on is that nobody playing online sleeps during the night in any of these survival games because it takes too much coordination for everyone in game to do so.

- For a crafting survival game it feels at odds that there's zero character customization apart from crafting armor. You can express yourself with how you build and decorate your base but you can't do so with the character you play as. There's two black kids, one white kid and one Mexican(?) kid. These characters all have their own unique personalities based on 80's youth stereotypes. Ah yes, the glam rocker, the nerd, the tough kid and Mabel Pines from Gravity Falls. Once you're playing multiplayer these characters can have some unique but limited banter between each other and it's all well written. These are all fun characters, but they feel like they're written more based on their 80's character trope than really any sort of ethnicity so it would be cool to see them either A) create more characters or B) let people customize the characters' appearance but keeping the voice and character that they have. But right now this current system does feel like placeholder as each time you load a save or die the game asks if you want to switch characters, so it's not like the game expects you to have a huge attachment to your avatar.

But even with all these issues I constantly feel like going back to play some more of this game so the foundation is there. I can see this game becoming really good in a year or two with updates.",1596031392,1596031802,False,3,0,0.458333343267440796,0,True,False,True,76561197974653316,446,79,1426,0,237,1596229510

Upon release this game feel more like an overpriced unbalanced tech demo from the depths of Marc Whitten's twisted idea of an xbox account requirement on PC. Come on guys. Get it together. After 20 years this shouldnt be hard by now. The game has a lot of potential but hopefully it does not get overshadowed by cheap gimmicks and slow development. From Obsidian and/or Microsoft, the idea of using EA seems sketch from such large studios. I really have high hopes for this game and really high expectations given the last 2 years of bad games from Microsoft and Obsidian not really doing much since New Vegas.

27,73464088,english,"As it stands this game is in VERY early access. If you just want to mess around in the sandbox with a few friends, I'm sure it's a fun time, but there isn't much to do. The ""story,"" or lackthereof more accurately, takes all of 10 minutes and isn't so much a plot as much as context for the setting. The map is terribly small and is severely lacking in verticality, and there isn't all that much to explore (and by explore I mean discover landmarks) so after you've built a base, there's nothing to do except build more, which isn't all that satisfying considering the relatively limited materials and the nasty depth of field effect (for the love of god, please add a setting to reduce or remove this) ruining any views you'd get from tall structures. There also needs to be more music; you will get sick of the main theme playing constantly, suggesting a sense of marvel and mystery every time you look at a new identical blade of grass.

The game does look nice, although there's plenty of room for improvement. The core mechanics and ideas are well done and enjoyable for the most part (combat and AI need the most work). There's a good amount of craftables and mobs present. I really like playing the game but its just too shallow. This is an absolute ripoff for $30, especially considering Subnautica is only $25 for a similar experience that's superior in every way (though lacking multiplayer). I'd recommend getting it with gamepass instead. 

So. I like the game and I hope for the best but it just needs more of everything. And I mean a lot more. And there needs to be something for ""lategame"" (a few hours in as of now) since the story isn't gonna cut it. Something like a PvP mode, long term objectives/bosses, or maybe scale insect raids a la 7 Days to Die to hit harder and have more threats as bases increase in size. 

In summary, this game is maybe a 7.5/10 survival game, but its only a 4/10 in content. The amount of bugs, landmarks, and just general environmental diversity that this game currently has is only a fraction of the amount that needs to be added. Pick it up if it scratches that childhood itch, or if you want to have some fun with coop, but you will have to make your own fun after the first few hours.

Day 1: Where am I? I got shrunk down? How? Damn its a beatiful world out there. Lets go exploring. Ants starts observing me what im doing. 

Me: Go away, im on a mission.
Ants: What mission?
Me: Peace of our time.

Ants start attacking me constantly and their numbers increased and then I died. Good start.

I respawned back. I see something moving in dense grass far off. Untill I saw it I regret everything now. A giant ass spider roaming around. There wasn't one but dozens. And then it saw me and instantly came after me while alerting other spiders as well. 

Spider: Oi, I see a juicy human there. Lets go kill it.
Me: OH HELL NAH. *runs away asap*

Damn nature, you scary.

Day 2: I figured out how to craft. Genious. Also you can find a machine which will analyze the item you collect 3 times/per use and then it needs to recharge for a while. 

Conclusion: Great graphics, crafting, open world game but you need MS account to login to play CO-OP. Big downside imo. They should just let ous invite players or host public server.

41,73460963,english,"The story forces you to play as a pre-teen, which immediately made me feel like I will be playing a child's game. I guess I should have clearly seen that coming. I played single player only on the PC. Hot take: consoles are for kids (get over it you old console players), so the xbox integration was probably wise of the developers.

The game play is simple and solid. It's the usual basic survival skills and staples like health, stamina, food, and water. It's the usual survival foraging, like chopping weeds, foraging for fibers, sap, sticks and stones. It's the usual survival fights, against mites, ants, and terrifying spiders. It's the usual crafting of tools, weapons, armor and base building. It's a LOT of the usual. The only thing that sets this apart is that I really like the feeling of being ant-size, in the forest of someone's back yard. And, the game is intuitive. 

This very early release is more of a demo, as you could probably experience the available story in about 10 minutes of play, if the story quest was your focus. When the story is developed, it could be good: trying to figure out why and how you were miniaturized. That said, the story is often childishly narrated, clearly for kids, which works given that you're playing as a child. 

Seeing the backyard through the eyes of a child, is fun, but this places limits on the game too, including limiting your audience, and weapons (i doubt we'll ever see guns, but possibly an alien zapping disintegration gun? since that sounds PG even if it's the same thing as shooting any normal gun)

Beautiful design too.

Had a good first play-through on the day of release. Hit a few technical hiccups at the start, which is to be expected of a game that has just released, however, once they were resolved I had an easier experience running the game compared to some of my other well established games.
I sincerely hope the developers are invested in releasing more content throughout its development phase. I'm looking forward to seeing what else Grounded can do.
It's relatively easy to get the hang of and adjust settings, the interface is clear enough. I'm impressed.

A friend of mine seemed to have a few issues with the building mechanics but I found it fairly easy, the rotation (via the mouse wheel) is quite sensitive when placing building parts. Might do well to develop a message that displays when a building piece can't be placed, explaining why, so the player can easily fix rather than having to guess. Just a thought.
Hope to see an easier 'Invite friends to game' option in the game soon too.

UI and tutorial could use some improvements too.

One second you're exploring the map and the next thing you know, you've walked right into a spider nest.

There were a couple of problems that we encountered while playing. First off, you need an Xbox Live account to play multiplayer. I saw that some people had trouble logging in, but it worked great for us. What didn't work was hosting a game. Sometimes it would throw an error, but most of the time i would just get stuck in a loading screen and i had to restart the game.

The game itself however ran great. I didn't get any fps drops, even when we got swarmed by an army of larvae. The environment was beautiful and the creatures were terrifying. We had a couple of crashes, but they weren't too bad. Thanks to autosaves we didn't lose any progress.
At the moment there is basically 0 story, so if you want that, you'll have to wait. We finished the story in about 45 minutes and then we just went exploring, built a base and did some quests. If you like that, i recommend you give this game a try. I'm sure there is a lot more content coming as well and i'm very excited about the future of this game.

Navigating map is simple because you only have to look at the sky, remember what's closer to the house/oak tree and go that way.

Day/Night cycle works fantastic. It's cool exploring in the daytime and can be scary at the night especially when you're on the high ground seing grass moving towards you. 

You can actually craft quite a lot of items and there's stuff to do for quite a while. I hope that devs will implement more night time objectives and creatures for that craft purposes like ladybugs and such.

I can´t say much about the Co-Op mode, haven´t played it, yet.

For an Early Access title, this game runs really smooth on my system. Sure, ome glitches here and there - but I haven´t found anything gamebreaking, yet.

And yeah, it´s not the cheapest Early Access title you can get, but I think it´s worth every single penny, especially with such an great developer building this game. I wasted so many $ into other cheap indie survival games - and I guess this time we will get something really great.

55,73458529,english,"Grounded is a game I have been looking forward since I first heard of it on Youtube, the theme of the game is just so unique and is an awesome take for a survival game. 

When you start the game, you get to see how special it really when seeing yourself as a shrunken kid, it's just stunning visually, the atmosphere is incredible, by far the most beautiful survival game out there.  
Now gameplay-wise, it's just as good, a little bit more different from the other survival games we have all played, it definitely feels far more UNIQUE then the other survival games we have received this decade. Forest looks really muddy, 7 days looks bland. It really helps the gameplay feel impactful. Although, it is a bit buggy, and I'm not talking about the bugs in the game. Some times the objectives wouldn't play a scenario, so I and my friend would have to exit out and retry it again. Nothing to bad, but there were some crashes towards the end of the campaign. Which is sadly quite short, you could probably finish it in half an hour.
Some resources are pretty difficult to get, but it could easily be dealt with if they allowed the players to build a wagon of some sort that players could use on long journeys to bring back grass or weed panels. Please add Wagons in the game. 
Besides that  I can honestly say this game is pretty much worth getting, it's fun on your own and with a friend, 


I really hope updates will be fast and constant, I do feel like it will not be as replayability as most of the other survival game but it definitely has potential to tower amongst the best of survival games.

64,73455923,english,"First off I have to say this is my first review to date on a product, let alone a early access title. That said i believe this game has the foundation to take it to being one of the most ambitious and enjoyable survival co-op we've had in a long time. 

I would like to say that for the first 3-4 hours my friends and I had horrible connection issues, as well as the gaming freezing, glitching out and just flat out crash if anyone but the host was in the server. It make the experience truly unbearable to the point one of our friends completely raged quit turning off his console without any notice to us. (Mind you I am on PC while everyone else is currently on Xbox that was in the server.) After this we changed the host of the server to myself and from there is was smooth sailing for rest of our 7 hour session. I know many people are irritated by the fact that Steam friends are not currently integrated and you have to have an Xbox account for online. In my opinion it wasn't much of a hassle being as I already use Xbox game bar for CoD cross-platform, but given time i believe they will find a way to integrate Steam better.(Though what can you honestly expect from a 1st party Microsoft game.)

With all that out the way it was a blast. I have not had a good scare in a game or shivers/chills running down my spine since playing Subnautica. The spiders are ABSOLUTELY TERRIFYING, I do have arachnophobia(no i do not have arachnophobia mode enabled at all), one moment life is fine picking some plant fibers then you turn around and HOLY F**K you're screaming like a little kid who in their first haunted house. Very scary gets your adrenaline going so far. Doesn't seem repetitive yet combat wise though we have no unlocked everything so far for crafting and weapons present at the moment. 
Each encounter we had was different to an extent, the current variety of bugs can seem low but I believe this is just a stepping stone to more they plan on adding. When we finally we able to kill a spider it took all four of us with the Rank 2 weapon ganging up on it beating it down like it owed us money, it was hilarious then we went around killing spiders until we f**ked and took on too 2 instead of 1 and it didn't end well. Game showed us right away the boundaries of our limitations. 

Currently the crafting is a little clanking to an extent in my opinion especially when it comes to placing walls for your base. Once you get a good exterior for walls it works out alot easier to build vertically. I did have an issue to where we did not actually found the material to build to foundation of any base until after we had already built up a good beginning base, which is just a pet peeve of mine might not be an issue for others. I like the limitation implemented to make sure you cant unlock every single craftable blueprint within the first day cycle or so. Seeing as this is early access there's a decent bit of crafting to begin with which makes for a good foundation to build on.

For the main story well there isn't one. Honestly not a big deal to me, there's a few little quests in the game but no story. I have seen some people saying the beat the game in 30 min and it's not worth it. Honestly they probably just did the story(basically tutorial taking you to quest hub) which I could see taking that long, but to unlock every item, craft everything, build a base, enjoy the game, test is out like is usual for early access then HELL NO it didn't take 30 min. Like i point out earlier in my review we've played a good 7 hours on one solid server with the same host and still don't have everything unlocked. Albiet we did f**k around alot(which come on survival/coop best place for it). Now i believe they could make a mysterious story that is just as good as the narrative of Subnautica, I know many may say that's a stretch since there is no story, but that's the point. In the little tid-bit we get of the story we know nothing, leaving behind the mystery. When you first get into the game it begins basically like Subnautica. Sake up no knowing anything, then finding out everything you can through your surroundings and little ""cassettes"" left around by someone with information that doesn't really make sense without context. I feel they took a good bit from them as well as The Forest when it comes to Grounded.

Overall i believe this to be a game well worth the $30 price tag even if there is no story and it has some bag bugs at the moment. Yes the beginning was rather game breaking but once it stabled out and we could play was well worth the experience! If you want a story then definitely wait for it in future updates and keep this game followed/wishlisted. If you don't mind no story and basically an Alpha build for the game get it!

Pro
- Atmosphere is astonishing
- sound effects are so nice. it feels very immersive
- the game mechanics basics are very good
- the game pace is nice
- the feedback are very good
- you feel in charge of your own progress 
- did I mentioned that the atmosphere is gorgeous

Cons:
- Map is small
- key bindings are limited (I want my inventory in tab and put things out of my inv using Q, this is standard in most games I play) 
- exchanging items w/ other chests: usually the own inventory is in the lower part and and the other inv is in the upper part, in most of the games I know. So it feels strange to me and I keep doing mistakes. I think the devs want to have it at the same position each time you look at your UI, but still it doesn't feel right
- I cannot easy access the number of items I carry on my shoulder
- I think it is damaging the immersion, that i cannot build within or on the big machine.
- why I can't hold the Ant Club and a Torch at the same time, both a one handed items
- I miss ceilings

75,73453898,english,"A few thoughts...

Good:
Looks pretty
Seems well optimized considering it is in early access
Map is fairly large
You can throw weapons and rocks
You can murder your friends by ""Hucking"" grass at them

Bad:
No character customization. You get to pick your ""teen"" 2 males/2 females. They look and sound more like 10-12 year olds
Only 4 players per map.
The map is forced Co-Op but you can murder each other
Building is a bit buggy but it's day 1 of early access
Must use Microsoft/Xbox login which means you use that name rather than getting to pick one.

Overall, I like it. It does feel a bit restrictive though. The game feels as though it is specifically designed for you to play Co-Op only, can only have up to 4 players in the game at a time, and you can only pick pre-made characters and you can't pick one someone else already has. 

I am in the camp of creating your own character that you personally identify with. I am a female in my 30s with red hair blue eyes and pale as mayo. The only reason I am ok with this though is because as much as the game pretends to be Honey I Shrunk the Kids + Rust... it's actually a story driven game (just the story is not really there yet) that has survival and base building thrown into it.

Maybe they will have more game types, more characters to pick, etc. We will see.... All I can say is Heavens forbid this game go down the dirty rat hole of selling additional characters, maps, and cosmetics on a cash shop... 

For now, I give the game a thumbs down, I don't do this lightly and will change my review when more is put in. But right now the game is a sliver of content with a large sandbox to build in.

I played the game thinking i was a god only to realise that i wasnt taking damage due to a bug and i was able to get endgame gear because of that withing first 30 mins, basically ruining the experience for me. spiders are a pain but they are terrifying, the screams they made caused $hit to run down my leg when they chased me hahaha.

the story so far its disappointing it is like 30 mins long ?? and once you have done that and explored everything, your left scratching your head wondering if there is a point in playing besides building a huge base which a huntsman took ease in destroying.... yeah thanks cooont

88,73452455,english,"[h1]well, the verdict is going to be hard. let me say it upfront[/h1]
The game has a fresh concept, beautiful artstyle, yet some poor decision making(s) here and there. i mean its an EA game, but come on..
For example, why would you need an Xbox account in order to play MP? Why would you only be able to invite friends from Xbox live friendlist? The fact that they claimed it to be a ""crossplay"" game, it just doesnt make any sense if you cannot hit up your Steam friends.
Also the 4-player cap could also be a huge dealbreaker to some people.

On the bright side though, apart from the overall idea slash concept i've mentioned earlier, this game is probably one of the prettiest survival games out there, ngl.
The combat, swinging animation, collateral destruction, hitboxes, you name it...everything just feels responsive as hell.
Ambience gets spookier the darker it goes, so dont let the artstyle fools you.

Story wise, during the first EA launch, only 20% is playable and will be added as the development goes further.
I completed mine in 30 minutes, so if you are here for the story then just go somewhere else and get back probably next year.
The universe is obv not too vast atm so you would probably get bored during 2-3h session.
They need to add more challenging features like natural disaster, weather system, and so on. 
I mean seriously, you'd literally be fine having a base without roofs xD

Building system is not in a state where it is remotely fun to have to do with. The insects don't give a shit if you have walls as they 1 or 2 shot your walls and just go ham in your base, ours was torn down to the bare bones like 5 times in 2 hours. (Even when we did not attack anything nearby)
AI is still really weird, we tried killing a spider but it keeps running away when it is on low health and then comes back with full, which feels unfair when it literally one shots you from really far away.
Story is at max maybe 20 minutes long unless you build an entire base before progressing the story. 
Progression in general is also really short, we analyzed most of everything in 2 hours.

Overall what you get right now in early access is a grind to make all the gear that's currently available and a ""hide your base"" simulator as walls do nothing to protect you or your stuff.

Obsidian Entertainment is one of my favorite remaining studios. I say remaining as most companies in the last decade have all gone after quick cash grabs. 

While Obsidian was developing Out Worlds they allowed 13 of their team members work on a different ""passion project"". This is a game made by people that wanted to experience this game world and play this game not a group looking to make a quick profit. As a gamer I love to support projects like this!  

Pro's

The creatures/AI's
 - Even in early access each bug has its own personality.
 - Interesting world
 - Fun crafting system... I made a helmet out of dismembered ants....
 - Crafting is really decent for a Early Access Game 

Con's (Addressing some other complaints I read from my perspective) 

Multiplayer- Have to use Xbox Live...
 - If you have a Microsoft Account really is not that big of a deal.

$30.00 Price Tag (Frequent complaint) 
 - You spend all your birthday money? 
 - If you love coop the game is worth it
  *Note* Issue I had was frequent crashes from multiplayer however, the game autosaves often. If this is a deal breaker wait a week and I am sure the developers will knock this issue out. 
- Going to possibly have a quick story line. Games great, I read that 20-25% of the story is out currently, I beat that in about two hours (focused on that goal not exploring). So imagining completed story would be around 6-8 hours? Time will tell. 


I always try and support passion projects and this game just came out. I want to give the developers Kudos and see where they go from here to improve this game. A passion project is always a risk, I hope Obsidian and Microsoft will stay this course over becoming like some of the other Triple A studios.

 Some of the creature also had issue moving, a spider got stuck in water just kinda rubber banding up and down on the surface. Another bug got stuck in a leaf and did the same thing, unable to attack.
 There are some ways to increase your movement speed in the game. When I had this effect, I was rubber banding as I ran. 
 Those are some bad things, obviously it IS in early access, issues are expected. There are, as far as I can tell, a nice variety of creatures to kill, and a cool crafting system to it.

There is plenty of content for everyone even at the basic start they have now. The spiders by the way ARE TERRIFYING. Nothing like seeing grass move in the distance and two seconds later a giant wolf spider descends up you. Instant death lol. Please give Obsidian your faith and I am sure it will pay off.

Kinda jarring.
ALSO FUCK SPIDERS
Was legit screaming at times.

Here are my thoughts after 7 hours of gameplay.

- Base building is frustrating and bugged. making a roof was mind fumblingly difficult. you definitely need foundations.

- Spiders are cool, but there are way to many of them (especially given that they can one shot you) and they are super buggy. I also find that even if you dont engage them, they passively walk slowly towards your position for quite some time and for some distance. Spiders need an overhaul ASAP

- I would love more items to improve the single player experience. Like maybe a shield or maybe the ability to tame an ant to use as a distraction

- I was TERRIFIED to get to the robot section because it was near the spider filled tree. It adds integral gameplay and should be easier to get to (especially as a tutorial quest)

- Water and food deplete to quickly for me to reasonably explore. Same with food spoiling way to quickly.

- The base building section needs way more stuff to build. I found that once was base was large and done... it was super barren without building the same things over and over.

- The night portion of the game seems... not scary or different. Besides running into spiders I expected something to happen, but nothing did.

- Once I had everything analyzed the analyzing stations seemed pointless. they cant protect from spiders and most of them dont have any special goods. I loved finding the underground one with granola bars. Made it feel special and unique.

- Exploring certain sections definitely showed how much left is in the game. It feels a lot like Raft right now with the chapters coming out over time.

- Multiplayer is bad right now, but I will wait. Just get rid of the XBOX live garbage and let us connect via steam.

- Let us place or throw torches on the ground so we can fight in dark areas with 2 handed weapons. please.

- I really wish some of the quest stuff was slightly highlighted. I completely missed the first chip near the robot and also missed the button near the first machine. Even a small glow around them wouldve been useful. Or even an arrow at the top of the screen pointing to them.

58,73445458,english,"A lot of the negative feedback I've seen for this game revolves around the multiplayer and Xbox account issues. Personally, neither my friend nor I had any issues whatsoever with this, so I can only speak on the game's content. Please keep in mind this game is Early Access and will see multiple updates, likely quite a few early on.

[b]Pros[/b]
-The game is very pretty graphically and doesn't seem to have many of the optimization issues that other survival games have.
-There is very little of the story there, but seems as if it's going to be neat. There's very little of it so far but a pop-up eventually informs you that much more is to come.
-The food and water meters are fair in comparison to resources in the world. You won't be spending 80% of your time hunting them down.
-Combat actually feels incredibly fluid for a day one EA game. There is some major clipping but that will be mentioned in the cons area.
-Crafting is intuitive and fresh. The way you unlock recipes is unique and adds a fun element to game progression.

[b]Cons[/b]
-Base building. I know it's an EA game, but good lord. Good luck placing a valid door that isn't 5 feet in the air, or trying to build a roof in a tight corner. The snapping is terrible as it appears to struggle between placing in mid-air and actually latching onto an object.
-Enemies. Specifically spiders. They will literally come out of [i]nowhere[/i] no matter where you are on the map and mess your shit up DAY ONE. They are incredibly over tuned so good luck taking one down too. Larvae apparently roam in gangs and will rip your face off and then kill the ladybug friend you were kindly building your base next too.
-Ties into enemies, but the clipping is bad. Half of a spider will be protruding through the wall and you can manage to hit it, but it will immediately start smashing your base in anger (and likely destroy anything you have placed next to the wall).
-Gathering materials for the base. Cutting down and carrying grass/wood is tedious and very heavily limits where you can build a reasonable base, especially considering the pacing of the game.

That's all for now. I'll continue to update this as the game progress. As of right now, taking into considering it's EA status, I'd give the game a solid...

[*]There doesn't seem to be a designation when spiders are active/not active. Are there certain times/areas?
[*]Sometimes worker ants just seemed to attack out of nowhere, or soldier ants would appear is [b]mass[/b] completely wiping your character out
[*]Building a door didn't let me align it with the ground and I had to build it raised up...even though the area was completely flat

I think most folks want to be able to put in a floor as soon as they start buildin a base.

It’s [b]Early Access[/b], and so the story element is quite brief, but the game itself is [i]stunning[/i]l. There’s something so purely enjoyable running around in this gorgeous world, eating disgusting stuff and knocking dewdrops off blades of grass while listening to a ladybug the size of a rhino kill some ants. 

The building pieces for making a base are so wonderfully, whimsically designed that I kept going ooh and aah over tiny little details (like how the second tier of storage boxes have a lid that consists of a leaf, where they’ve actually kept the stem on the back end of the chest. It looks [i]so[/i]] lovely. Whoever is doing the designing of the building blocks and items deserves a raise). All the pieces have so much texture and personality. It’s also hugely enjoyable to work as a group to gather the materials and designing structures because of how you put down a blueprint and anyone can add the materials.

I played with two friends, and while we had some initial hiccups with connecting to one another, once we got it to work it worked just fine. However, I do feel the store page should make it clear that just using your steam account won’t allow you to play with your friends. There’s no added cost but a little bit of added hassle that caused some irritation.

If you want to play this for the story element, and don’t care about supporting and beta testing the game in early access, I advice that you wait until they’ve added more of it. As it is, you can run through the story very swiftly.

However, if you (like me) love to play and enjoy games during their development and enjoy waiting excitedly for every update, and you love survival games in general… it could certainly be the game for you.

I plan on going through and finding everything to craft everything. So, even though the story is super short for the time being, the rest of the game should keep someone busy for some time until they add more.

Thought the crafting/menus were pretty intuitive. I didn't feel stumped at the start, where as other survival games seemed to make you work a bit more to figure out some recipes.

Played this game with my s/o an hour after it's release, we had fun but also some complaints. 
First and foremost, the game at it's current state is absolutely NOT worth $30. There is little to no content already and the game wants you to finish the story immediately. Even if you weren't trying to progress with the story right away, you would still do it by accident. It's incredibly easy to finish the story in 10 minutes, even without knowing much about what's going on. In BOTW you could go straight to the castle and finish the game technically, it's open from the start. However, the game encourages you NOT to do this as it's very dangerous and gives you a lot of other options to help you progress and learn how to play. Right after the incredibly short tutorial, Grounded sends you off to do the 20% of content immediately. [spoiler] I believe if you told the players to go explore and find the landmarks/stations or find the tapes BEFORE telling them to fix the wires, it would be a lot better. Or even making the players have to progress a lot more before they're able to fix the wires. Being able to fix everything almost instantly is pretty lame. [/spoiler] *potential game content spoiler

The only reason I'm giving this game a thumbs up is because it has a LOT of potential. This is very unique and refreshing and I quite enjoy it. I'm very excited to see the game improve and have more content. Even with the disappointment of the lack of content, I had a really fun time playing this game for the first time.

36,73438925,english,"This is only an initial review as I think I'm at the three hour mark, but this game is a different bag of chip. I've been excited about it for months now, and waited with baited breath this morning for the game to hit the store, then download. I waited and didn't play the demo, because I wanted more than just the demo. To say I'm excited is an understatement, actually. 

To start off, I personally had to turn down the blurring motion and put myself in 3rd person because I'm easily motion sick from certain game and that fixed the only major problem I had. (Outside of the 5 year old that was sitting next to me asking when his turn was.) I'm playing a single player, offline game, so it feels pretty seamless at this point. 

My first hour was spent discovering random things, learning to find water, food, smack things. I'm finding the ants both creepy and adorable, the lady bugs are literally the size of a Fiat, and we won't even traipse into the wolf spiders. (Side  note! There is a setting for the spiders! Although, I honestly feel they need to size scale the photo that they show you of what they look like. The wolf spider may as well be a mini mansion.) Speaking of, my second hour was spent trying to beat lawn mites, make torches, before I got ate (not literally) by the above mentioned wolf spider and just about flipped my lid because all I saw was a leg come down over me before it nonchalantly traipsed past. No big thing, right? <_<

The third hour, after finding my bag of goodies where I'd had my face eaten, was when I dove into the building aspect of the game. So far, I really like the building. It's easy while still being a challenge. I'm still discovering things, and I also really like how you ""haul"" things. This isn't a game where you shove 90 planks in your pack; No, you're going to be carrying those on your shoulder or ""hucking"" them. 

My two somewhat dislikes are minor and I can get past those. The first being water, it's sort of both sides of the coin, ground water is drinkable, but even your character makes jokes about cholera, etc. The process of getting fresh water at first is a bit more difficult, doable, but difficult. (Not going to mention exactly how, don't want to spoil that for other.) My second thing on the con side, although, again minor, I'd like to see more of an opening to the game down the road. 

Overall first impressions, the game is fun. I can see it being a lot more fun the more fleshed out it gets. I'd love to try to co-op mode at some point as well to see how it functions.

41,73438720,english,"First, I'd like to say that I had played the Demo for many hours, so most of my 'first impressions' are based on that.   The TL/DR  though:  ""Recommend the game, but either wait for a sale, or wait for more progress to be made on it""


So.  The game.  ""Is this game worth it right now?""  I'd say,  yes.  However, is it worth the $30 asking price?  That's harder to answer.  Since I loved the Demo I was ready to pay that much, but I do feel that it could have stood to have a ""Launch Day Sale"".  With that being said, I'd suggest either waiting for full release or for a sale.

Content?  As of right now, I'm still (slowly) making my way through the game and taking my time doing things.  This is where the $30 asking price is probably a turn-off for most people.  Unless you're okay with knowing RIGHT NOW it has a small amount of content,  I'd again suggest waiting until the game's filled up more and is better suited to the price it currently has. 


Another mixed thought I have is the bare-bones ""Tutorial"".  I'm no stranger to games like this having minimal or even no tutorial, expecting you to figure things out on your own.  Heck, Minecraft was a lot like that too.  It's not terribly hard to figure things out though, and the Research stations help with filling in the blanks. My suggestion, research those plant fibres right away.
Could it stand to have a better tutorial? Sure, it wouldn't hurt any - but I don't hold it against the game for not having an amazing one either.


So final thoughts?  Yeah, I could recommend the game.  Can I recommend it for $30? Probably not. I'd say ""Wait a while, or get it on sale"".",1595978752,1595978752,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True,76561198072429429,614,22,90,0,8,1596076351

That within it self had sold me even with as little we got the tapes that discovered also brought me deeper into the lore and narrative.
For the game play it definitely has a good survival crafting element to it with more edible options I'd say.

Im going to start with the bad point first and end on the good stuff!
Cons...
After 2 hours of play this game no longer lets me play...my first save for some reason as it was becoming day time on the second day the brightness got insane and everything went crazy bright green like neon, eventually the whole screen went pure white and now that is the after math on loading that save so i started a new game, but even worse now i click play on steam it starts to load and bam! straight back to steam, so i have currently wasted 25 bucks on a game i cannot even open, i have had 4 or 5 crashes closing the game with no freeze or warning mid play, to return and find my save was a few minutes back which in a survival game like so every second counts, re crafting things re collecting resources etc.

Pros...
The graphics are great, i have not had any graphical issues, lag or frame drops whilst playing, after 2 hours of game play running around trying to collect as much as everything like a hoarder to get a nice little base set up, i did not bother with following the tutorial i wanted to just explore and it was fun, i shall try multi-player tomorrow when a friend gets it and i feel it will be good. controls feel good and set out good. and the option of 1st and 3rd person makes the game even better.

Right now i do not recommend this game, its good for a short time but too many crashes and other issues and currently not that much content, at a later date indeed i would completely recommend when its larger in content, but not for the price now! avoid for a while and come back later, you will thank me!",1595977162,1595978310,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True,76561198069203341,56,5,2249,0,130,1596574340

It's an Early Access title, it's in the description, bugs are to be expected, even on a full game that's not Early Access. 

Just from the little bit of game I put in with 3 other friends, I can tell this is going to be a game I'm going to enjoy. I would honestly recommend waiting for a week or so after launch. So devs can iron out the crashes/bugs some of us are encountering. Once that is out of the fixed though, I would recommend the game fully.

In my opinion the issues I have had is yes it does take a while to ""host a game + get a friend to connect"" but if you keep retrying it works after a while. Just be paitent. I didnt have any problems with starting the game, everything worked fine [might be your shitty pc's that is the problem].

To all of you who are thinking of buying/playing it. Here are the pro's + cons.

Pro's
> I love the cartoony/kiddy art style reminds me of Raft. So if you like that then by all means play it!
> I have encountered the spiders and man it is scary when they pop out of no where lol.
> The game runs smoothly and i had no issues with certain things.
> So far the story is pretty cool and exploring underground places is pretty fun especially on top as well.
> Building mechanics I really enjoy and crafting is simple.

Con's
> It lacks content at the moment as its early access. There is only so much you can do after progressing through the story.
> Tutorial is simple and not completely friendly but you do get used to it and figure it out. Just use your brain. lol

However running it at 1440p on epic settings no problem, I can say that it is a very pretty game that alot of work has gone into.  Yes only the intro of the story is in the game but lets be real, people don't play 7days2die, ARK, etc for the intro story.  They play for the sandbox, the customization freedom you have when building, the exploration to find different things.  Even though its just a back yard, there is plenty of stuff to run around and find.

I have been entertained so far in learning lots of recipes, having to venture and attack harder bugs to get better tiers of tools, weapons, armor (which have set bonus's), building defenses...

The bug AI is also kinda fun to mess with.  The little leaf eaters skitter away when you loot at them.  A ladybug kept following me around investigating me chopping down grass, dandelions, etc.  I even messed with the ants, crafted an unsecure pot and put food in it out by itself, was funny watching one worker ant sniff it out then abunch of worker ants come back and raid the food.

So far the game is just a baby getting started though I see alot of stuff that can easily make it turn into like 500 hours of fun messing around playing just like in 7days2die and ARK.

- Confusing tutorial - Doesn't teach you how to craft things, had to google it. Vague instructions ""Fix this"" ""Fix that""

- Couple of bugs, nothing game-breaking (bodies would sometimes fly off after killing an enemy)

some people have gone around saying that its like fornite save the world, its a horde fighting game n let me clarify, its not, its like a normal survival open world game where you can build buildings n structures, n since you're small n its a big backyard n such, theres abit of parkour in the game.
the models n the textures in this game is really pretty looking and i cant wait to see what this game has in store with their planned features, i know some of em but i cant wait to see it be put into action, especially the campaign c: so would i recommend it?

well it depends on two things, do you want to play as a lil person in an open world with dangerous insects n spiders? fight to survive? then id say yea, plus being okay with some slight ingame bugs (the code ones c; )

if you're very bothered by slight bugs or crashes n cant handle a survival game that has a story, but barely anything in it so far, then id say wait a while, maybe a year or two n this game should differ alot from what is out now ^^ 

but personally from what ive seen i would recommend that you give it a go c: id say its worth its price with the experience that you get, and yes co op does work, i played it with 2 other friends n it worked fine, was abit finicy at the start of launch but thats to be expected, thats how it goes with every multiplayer/co op games that get released n people immediately hop on it to play with their friends, but i can confirm that it works now",1595970150,1595970150,True,2,1,0.469696968793869019,0,True,False,True,76561198081811246,499,32,283,0,158,1596049591

[olist]
[*] Firstly, to cover all the negative reviews for the co-op not working, I experienced this issue as well. I exited the game and reloaded it, and was able to connect with a friend, no problem.
[*] The crafting and modular building systems in the game are nice, compared to many other crafting/survival games I've played. (Although, I couldn't find floor pieces, so I was stuck using scaffolding, unfortunately)
[*] in its current state, I cannot see enough flushed out mechanics that would provide longevity or replayability. After messing around for 90 minutes, we built everything we could want to build, researched most of the craftables, and completed the story up to what's currently implemented. We didn't explore all the caves, because it felt pointless after we built everything and completed the current story.
[*] The game is gorgeous, and well optimized (just under 4 gigs for great looking textures, audio, lighting, subsurface scattering, etc.)
[*] Death seems to hold no real consequence. Subnautica had a similar issue in its early stages of development. Why bother drinking and eating if you can just die and respawn at a location you can create? Subnautica got passed this issue by having such a large map, the player was inconvenienced by being dragged away to their last spawn point while losing their means of travel. Hopefully Grounded gets updated to a similar, or perhaps better solution for hunger/thirst/death being more meaningful.
[/olist]

I can foresee Grounded taking one of 2 potential routes with their updates:
[olist]
[*] Create an immersive story that provides a few hours of entertainment, but little to no replayability.
[*] Focus more on the survival and building elements, with more diversified goals for the players to explore or seek out, like ""The Forest"" or ""Ark: Survival Evolved"". 
I'm hoping more for this option, so the game will be worth spending hours in, with friends. 
As it stands, everything is too easily achievable, even in the hardest difficulties of the game. This robs the players of a sense of accomplishment, when they can make everything in merely a couple hours, without the fear of dying causing set backs.
[/olist]

As for bugs (not the creepy crawly ones) I only ran into 1, so far. My buddy was stuck in a spider web, broke the web with a hatchet, but was still stuck in the air. He needed to log out and rejoin my game to fix it.

I will provide a positive rating, and recommend this game as it gets updated. Obsidian Entertainment has a solid list of games under their belt, so I do not believe they will abandon this game in it's early stages of development. 
I do hope they find a way to stretch out the game into something I can stay immersed in for many hours like [b]""Subnautica""[/b], [b]""The Forest""[/b], and [b]""Ark: Survival Evolved""[/b] did.",1595969525,1595969910,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,True,76561197992297217,645,4,90,0,90,1595961410

Akin to playing other games of this genre have managed to spend 3 hours killing bugs and building a house rather than playing the campaign side of things. I have died to spiders many times (and screamed often) and enjoyed co-op play. The game is pretty and I haven't finished the story line yet. Gameplay is great so far with only small hitches which are clearly designed for consoles with more streamlined controls (such as gliding).

For an early access game at £25 that STATES the full story is not there and there are only 2 tiers etc etc I fully reccommend this game to casual players. Do not expect a multi hour story arc on early access or high fps, this is a test phase for optimisations and bug fixes not a finished game.

Down points:
Xbox account required
More graphically demanding than you expect (1080 getting 70fps avg 1440p@Med).

tl;dr Campaign not yet released (or there wouldn't be a final game), Bug smashing is fun, Spiders are terrifying. Play for fun and support of the devs.

As for now I highly recommend the game. It has the feel of the forest but is more lighthearted.  You're  immediately thrown into a world with no reason why you've been shrunk and what to do from there. While you leave the initial starting area the tutorial starts. As you follow the tutorial you should be following a path from where you've woken up from. Through this path you will find a mysterious device in which you will interact with. After you do everything it needs you meet a robot that explains some what of what happened and what to do next.

48,73431697,english,"I see some mixed reviews here and some misunderstanding.

To clarify about Multiplayer - There is online multiplayer as of the release (Just played for 2 hours with my friend) however you do need to have a Microsoft account to sign in and use Xbox services. Players can not join lobbies at the moment but one person will need to start a game as the Host, and other players can join as long as they are friends on Xbox with you and then they can join the in-progress game.

The game itself is quite fun, and there are some annoying bits here and there as it is clear it is geared towards Xbox system.

The mechanics are pretty much the same as The Forest in the sense of chopping trees and building bases. Thirst and Hunger are not too difficult to deal with but it can be hard to get started. 

The graphics are pretty good and the story is okay so far (apparently it is short but I have not finished it 2 hours in since I focused my base walls). 

There are not to many bugs that I have ran across, some very minor things. The base building can be wonky since walls cannot go into world objects very much at all (say an adjacent rock) so it makes it hard at times to completely enclose an area while making use of the natural wall structures (dirt hills and rocks for example).

I would say $30 does seem a little pricey for the current content but the game is still a lot of fun and offers a good amount of content, even if its sandbox, for the time being.

Spiders are scary

Voice Acting much better than demo
Endless amount of room to add things and improve on
Each blade of grass can be jumped on or cut down
Collecting small resources is not an annoying tedious task
The way the mobs react to you
No game breaking bugs while playing yet


Neutral:
Map size is fine.
Places to explorer are okay
Amount of mobs is okay but with games like ARK more will have to be added


Cons:
Story is about 1 hour or less
Repetitive quests after story is finished
Have to use Microsoft account but why would you expect not to?? ITS A MICROSOFT GAME
Is missing a fair amount of small details that other survival games have
Bugs can sometimes clip walls/rocks/grass to hit you or stuff you have placed.



All in all read what the game is. Know its a microsoft game and dont throw a fit when they ask you to log in. The game is great even with its limited story content. There are things to do just mostly surviving in the yard with no real task. Buy the game and play it refund if you dont like it and wait for more content. However if your here for story content please wait till they add more you will be disappointed.

If you have log in issues try again a few hours later. The game is brand new and a lot of people just downloaded it at the same time and clicked play at the same time. Give it a second.

So far this game looks promising. The UI is nice, the atmosphere is great, points to the VAs and character designs too!

On the flipside, Max's line ""Imagine how that sounded when it hit the ground! BOOM!"" is fitting here; the game has so far crashed on 3 different moments.

1) Building a lean-to, which is highly recommended by the game to keep yourself alive on your first night. Think that first house you made in Minecraft, just something to wait out the night, albeit an inventory item.

2) Saving. I'm not sure why, but manually saving crashes the game.

3) Quitting (oh the irony). Manually quitting from the pause menu also crashes the game.

37,73427708,english,"So, after about an hour in this game, I'm already glad I bought it. Between the roaming packs of ants hunting down animals (and me) like wolves in that Liam Neeson movie and the wolf spider hunting me down like a giant sneaky assassin, I've already died a few times. I don't mind it though, you can respawn where you loaded into the world or if you've built a lean to (as far as I've gotten) you can set that as your respawn point. In my first 2 game days, I've made a workbench to craft more complicated stuff, some walls to protect my stuff, and a couple chests to store my stuff. I also made a roasting spit to cook bug meat (I assume it will be bug meat-I've only been eating mushrooms so far).

I like that there's a field station that provides somewhat decent protection from the nearby hostile bugs (stupid wolf spider couldn't get me in there, but I could hit it) and that you use the field station to ""analyze"" the various resources you pick up-and that's how you unlock the recipes to craft stuff. For example, analyzing sap unlocked the workbench recipe. There's a limit to how many things you can analyze at once (I assume it's to help with the pacing of the game) and once you've used your limit you have to wait 8-9 minutes before you can analyze something else.

I haven't tried out the multiplayer yet and I've only fixed the initial strange machine you find right after you walk down the path that led you from the spawn point to the field station. I'm as excited to reveal the story in this survival game as I am to build up a base and do the normal survival crafting game routine.

In short, I obviously haven't seen a ton of what the game has to offer so far, but for $30 and the knowledge that more content is on the way, it was an easy choice for me to get it.
