24,Fallout 76,71907696,english,"(03 October 2020)
A lot has changed for Fallout 76 in the last month or so, and I feel it is time to change my review to reflect those changes.

It is first important to understand that the target demographic of Fallout 76 was persons that wanted a multi-player fallout experience.  I am NOT part of that demographic, and I'm making the assumption anyone in the true target demographic has already tried FO76 and has their own opinions on its value in that regard.  This review is directed at anyone that enjoyed other Fallout games and just wants a new Fallout world to explore.

The wastelanders update added most of the things I was looking for in a single player Fallout experience.  It has a pretty good main quest that you can complete solo and felt comparable length to the main quest of Fallout 3 or 4 (if you were to choose one faction and just do their questline).  

If the game were still in the state it was when I purchased it, I would give this a solid $40 or less buy recommendation for players wanting a new single player Fallout experience (I don't really enjoy the multi-player aspects, but I also only experienced griefing once in ~3 months of mostly daily play).  For me, I still found it worth it to subscribe to Fallout 1st for my time playing the game just to get more of a lone wanderer feel that other Fallout games have.

The reason I can no longer recommend the game in good conscious is the changes introduced with the One Wasteland update several weeks ago.  Before the update, I could play the game pretty much however I wanted and a sub-optimal build (like mine) would struggle at times, but still be able to do most things.  With the scaling changes in One Wasteland, even common enemies have become bullet sponges, and something like a rad scorpion can take 2 or 3 full clips from an automatic weapon to kill.  To me, this change killed any sense of progression (instead of feelign stronger as I level, I feel weaker) and this has diminished my enjoyment of the game (I felt forced to min-max just to put myself on similar footing to what I had previously from a casual build). 

If you are a min-maxer, then the game is probably still a good choice for you, but if you just want to play and enjoy a Fallout experience, I would avoid the game for now (hopefully they will continue to adjust PVE balance, but I have no idea how long it will take to get the game back to being a good choice for all player types).  If you have Microsoft GamePass, I would still recommend giving it a try there (where your only investment is download time and drive space, but for everyone else, wait for a sale, or just spend your time and money elsewhere).",1593726537,1601739737,FALSE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,207,13,43184,2925,43184,1601388169

NPCs and Allies feel shallow. They also like to walk away from you when you're talking to them. There's also a 60% chance your ally will not be interactable until moving their station and logging out and back in.

With that being said, it is more difficult for new players to start out because of the mobs scaling, so bringing a friend is advised. :)

38,Fallout 76,76394657,english,"Were I asked to review this game before the Big Boy update that happened this month, I'd say that it would be a fun experience...

Surprise surprise.  It's not fun anymore.

(If PVP isn't mentioned then it's because I don't participate in PVP)

Maybe it's the fact that my character that was supposed to be a glass cannon through the power of punching now does roughly a quarter of what he used to do? Maybe it's the fact that all the enemies I face are a minimum level of 50?

At first, I thought the new brotherhood group missions were simply tougher than normal enemies because of the mutation until I checked my damage output.  Before hand, with the max boost in damage from the level 5 adrenaline perk, I was doing just above 2k (2.2k probably) damage per punch with a level 50 triple clawed Deathclaw Gauntlet [Bloodied] and now I barely can do 500.  Mind you, Melee weapons aren't ranged.  I'm not camping behind cover as I take high damage pot shots, I'm out in the open, almost guaranteed to get hit with some sort of damage so if I can't take out one enemy in a group in 2 swings OR LESS, then chances are I'm dead or Serendipity saved the shit out of me.

I had gathered a diverse group of fisting weapons so I don't have to use my strongest weapon on the weakest creatures.  Let me tell you that my level 15 boxing glove turning mothman cultists by vault 76 into a bloody explosion in one punch as I hear their last words like it's some kind of anime death is absolutely HILARIOUS.  Same can be said about using the boxing glove to one shot the super mutants in Grafton.  With the npcs leveling up with you, all that fun is gone... though if I hadn't been nerfed that boxing glove could still have it's use.  Not just the boxing glove, but the moleman gauntlet and the vampire knuckles as well.

I forgot what I was writing about, probably venting muh problems.

UPDATE:
Here's a pros and cons list that I may continue to slowly add things or change things to.

PROS:
-You can play a Fallout game with your friends (I consider this game more of a socializing game more than anything.)

CONS:
-You are weak (Everyone got nerfed.  Best you can be is a bullet sponge.)
-Enemies get stronger.
-Nukashine is worthless now with the nerf.  (Wow, the enemies that take 2 punches now takes *gasp* 2 punches.  *Blacksout*)
-With the introdction of those mission things, Public events (Radiation Rumble specifically) have no one participating.
-Either Legendary Charisma doesn't actually make it so you can share higher level perk cards or the game doesn't want you to share park cards higher than 3.  (Charisma public groups are essentially meaningless for the same reason.)
-Was fighting the windigo colossus in a public server, there were other people in the server, but the only people participating were in my public group/the event didn't show up on the map and I merely fast traveled to my group member to do it.  With the nerfs, suffice to say we failed with 3 people.
-People don't seem to share perks and when they do, they don't seem to realize that they are sharing the same perk as someone else.  (I'd make a guide on what perks to share but it would only amount to ""What not to share"" and some would be very specific i.e. don't share Born Survivor when one of your team mates is 90% radiation.  That's just wasting stimpaks.)

I though Bethesda was great, now they are just another big game company with little soul left. Sad.

59,Fallout 76,69334216,english,"(OUTDATED. THINGS HERE MAY HAVE CHANGED)

The Positives
The map:
 It's a very large and beautiful open world with varying types of areas to explore. Nice lush green areas,Swamps, mountain ranges, charred wasteland regions, dried up and irradiated lakes, and even destroyed towns and cities infested with all types of abominations of the wasteland infesting it. Like other Fallout game, I felt like I was in the post-apocalypse. So I'm glad that still holds true for this one.

Graphics/performance:
It's nothing groundbreaking. A lot of assets were used from Fallout 4 and put into this game so the textures, models, and whatnot are about the same level of quality of Fallout 4 so they are ok. Performance was also ok with minor stuttering and lag...at least... it was once I had to get out of my way to go into the game files and fix it myself....I'll delve into that more in a bit.

The Story and Npc's:
 I can't really say I was all that interested in the game's main story with the Overseer. I won't Spoil anything in case anyone actually cares, but if you are expecting levels of storytelling similar to that of better RPG's well...this ain't it. Although not downright awful, it didn't capture that level of investment or care I had with other previous fallout questlines from other games. It honestly feels like a glorified fetch quest but I'll get to that in a bit. 

OK, but what about Wastelanders?

Well, it's an improvement to say the least. It gives new quests and adds npc's to the game. They should've been in the game from day one but, they're here now so that's something i guess. The npc characters are enjoyable and have varying personalities. They are interesting to talk to and actually made me invested into playing each questline to the very end. Again, I won't spoil anything in case someone even cares, but long story short it provides the rpg feeling to a game that's famous for lacking it despite fallout being well known for that. So I feel that it's a step in the right direction, and if they keep adding stuff like this it would significantly benefit this game. 

Players and online aspect:
This game really benefits from playing with others. ""An online multiplayer game is better when other players play it? Ya don't say.""  Yeah I know it's shocking. However, this game especially benefits from it. Nearly the entire Charisma perk tree is based around playing with others and honestly if you have friends who have this game, you'd do well to play with each other. I've played this game alone for almost my entire play time and it's tough and somewhat lonely. Your build may also change depending on whether or not you have people playing with you. Though, if you are more of a lone wolf, don't worry, you'll still be effective if you play your cards right. Overall this game has a friendly community and I quite like it. Though of course there'll be the occasional jerk, but that's to be expected in online games so I won't knock it for that.

Perks and leveling: 
The leveling and perk system is different from other Fallout games. For one, the stats max out at 15 instead of 10 and now there are way more perks to choose from. the perks are now ""Perk cards"". The game lets you swap these ""Perk cards""  at will and lets you mix and match them. Not only that but the game even adds ""mutations"" which give the player a small buff and debuff. It makes builds versatile and allows room for creativity...to an extent...






Negatives
Right so that's pretty much all I like about this game. Though there also plenty of things I dislike as well. I won't go into things like the atom shop and fallout 1st, because we all know it's shit. 

Performance issues:
As I mentioned up top I had to go into the game files and fix the stuttering and frame drops. My computer isn't a potato or anything nor is it high tier. It's pretty mid tier if anything. Yet, despite this it couldn't even handle the games ""Medium"" preset settings. Barely even handled ""Low Settings"". So the first 5 hours was just me stuttering and frame dropping into the damn 5th dimension until I got angry and looked up a video on how to fix that. It runs fine now, but frame drops, crashes, and freezing was and still is a persistent issue throughout my whole experience. 

Bugs and issues:

Freezes:
8

Total number of crashes:
16

Bugs:
-disembodied enemies standing in place with infinite health 
-Sentry turrets at C.AM.P. fire at nothing endlessly until you scrap them
-Having normal enemy mutate despite them not being listed as legendary
-Cannot equip weapons in inventory and forces me to do melee combat until I either die or quit the game and log back in
-infinite loading screens
-Invisible enemies melee hitting you for lots of damage despite no enemy being in sight or near you
- Not being able to equip grenades
-Heavy weapon gets stuck in ADS despite me not even aiming.
-Game completely freezes on startup and then crashes 
- being randomly staggered by absolutely nothing
-being randomly caught on fire by nothing
-automatically being put back into workbench after exiting it
- T-pose while in power armor
-your character going invisible for no reason
- enemies teleport in front of you and sometimes causes game to freeze only to unfreeze itself. But by then you''re already dead. 
- Loading into texture-less world and or world not loaded when fast traveling somewhere
- Rockets from rocket launcher not exploding when fired and disappear into the void

The Missions:
A large portion of them are glorified fetch quests (yes even the wastelander missions. but at least those have some personality).  A lot of the missions involve robots, deadmen or deadwomen in holotapes or notes explaining how they were trying to do something important like stop the scorched or set up some communications somewhere, or even collect data for something they need. There's lots, and I mean LOTS of times where a character tells you to get something all the way across the map and then tells you to come all the way back only for them to send you off again to collect something else on another corner of the map. It gets old fast, and since this game makes you pay caps to the void every time you fast travel, it makes it very hard to stay wealthy in this game unless you are making an actual effort to grind caps. and speaking of grind....

The Grind:
All Fallout games have grinding in them and are reasonable, but this game takes it to the next level. It's pretty ridiculous honestly. You know the dude in power armor on the front cover of the wastelander's poster for the game? You want to get that armor? Cool, then all you have to do is spend the next 4 weeks grinding and that's assuming you play this game every single day. Oh BTW you have to also complete the Overseer questline and Wastelanders questline which will take you a few days. The same goes for every single item, weapon, and armor that's been added on top  of the base game. All of it takes a huge amount of time. so unless you have the will, time, and or friends to help grind with you then you may as well just stop and play something else, because you won't be getting much of that new content anytime soon. To put it into perspective I've played this game for 176 hours and the only thing I have so far from the new content is the gauss Pistol with like 2 mods. That's it.

Conclusion:
I want to say a LOT more but I've run out of space for the review. Honestly I can't recommend this game for casual players or players who have a limited time to play during the week. It just takes too long for the game to be fun, and just makes me want to play other fallout games like NV. If you have a dedicated friend(s) then it would enhance the experience a lot, though not everyone has that, and relying on other people to make a flawed game fun ain't a good sign.

81,Fallout 76,76788295,english,"Fallout 76 IS a good videogame. It does however, have its faults and drawbacks. I will list both pros and cons but keep in mind that I recommend this game.

Pros:
-Great MMO experience and can feel totally alone or extremely populated
-Fun combat with a variety of weapons and armor. all playstyles are valid
-Challenging and differing enemies to keep you on your toes
-immersive and beautiful landscape with unique biomes.
-Relatively new player friendly for those not used to the game
-A Battlepass

Cons:
-Lacking in RPG and story elements
-It does not feel as though you as a character have an impact on the world
-Intimidating presence from veteran players and requirements at higher levels.
-High disregard for the lore of past fallout games.
-A Battlepass

Overall, I would recommend this game to anyone who wants to have a good time scavenging a wasteland and nuking mutants with their friends. If you are looking for a game with strong roleplay elements, a story driven game where your choices matter, or a sequel to any previous fallout game, then you will be disappointed. Fallout 76 is an MMO set in the fallout universe. It's lore is ""meh"" at best. That being said, If you are looking for an online game that you can put hundreds of hours into crafting weapons, doing NPC quests, and slaying monsters of all kinds, then you will love this game.

Cons
-With the One-Wasteland i suggest do not buy this game because if u are not a pro build player in this game now you cant damage ultra buffed enemies, one-wasteland literally made the game unplayeble and hardcore for non optimized builds and new players
-Buy it and look if you get 60 fps everywhere in the map because this shitty game engine depends on your fps, if your fps is under 60 you cant play this game just refund it
-Low stash capacity (Dunno why have stash capacity)
-DAMAGE REGISTIRATION IS NOT AVAILABLE AT THE MOMENT YOU CANT ONE SHOT ENEMYS WHEN YOU SHOT THEM THEY DIE AFTER 2 SECOND YOU SHOT THEM
-Rubberband lag problem in some servers
-When joined a server, for a minute or two quests and map marks wont load
-When talking mission givers skipping breaks the game and reputation bar glitches
-Pointless Hunger and Thirst system
-Pointless short events like; Treasure Mole Miner Event
-Nuclear Winter Beta level prizes are locked behind Overseer level and its time consuming to level up because battle royale sucks and filled with cheaters
-Empty map (literally there arent any CITY)
-Fill-in, pointless, not serious quests (time consuming and for exp grind)
-Stupid daily quests (really you can make it at least funny or challenging)
-SERVER DISCONNECT OR GAME CRASH ON SCORCHED EVENT
-While looting legendary mobs, body disappears before you loot
-Cant sell ammo to the npc vendors
-Cap cap, gold bullion cap, ticket cap-Lack of content
-Appalachia main story too short and not prizing enough
-Too many thing locked behind gold bullion system and grinding gold bullion is not enjoyable, at least let us craft gold bullion with FUCKING GOLD
-Enemy encounter levels not even (you can see lvl 23 and 63 at same place)
-YOU CANT HIT ANY FLYING MOB IN CLOSE COMBAT
-Scorchbeast spawn spawns more than one and they endlessly spawn scorched minions
-Below lvl 65 is basically doomed (find super sledgehammer and double barrel shotgun, use them until lvl 50)
-Vanilla missions are so unneccesary it makes you see how bad this game was
-Some vanilla legendary guns are deleted from game but player still have them
-No way to get any skin, plan, recipe or weapon if deleted before Wastelands dlc
-Unforgiving game design, means if you run out material and ammo you can start using pipe pistol this leads to 'our servers cant handle infinite stash' but the game sells you infinite stash capacity scrapbox

The game is fun in a limited capacity at certain times.  You have to negotiate with it.  You have to let it's poorly executed reward mechanisms screw you over a couple times until you figure out what the game meant for you to do.  I'll give examples.

[b] What I thought was fun. [/b]
Going around the wasteland, scavenging parts and scrap.

[b] What the game meant was fun. [/b]
Only go out for what you need in the immediate future.  Your storage space is limited.  Plan accordingly.  You will not be able to save enough for both what you are trying to build now and may wish to build in the future.

[b] What I thought was fun. [/b]
Leveling up, stating my character out with neat random perks along the way, working with what I had to get to where I wanted to be.  Being pleasantly surprised.

[b] What the game meant was fun. [/b]
Putting points into whatever allows you optimize carry weight because you didn't think I was serious about example one.  Winding up running heavy weapons all the time because it meant you could still fast travel if the game decided to reward you with a literal naval cannon directly to your inventory.  Stimpacks are a pound each. If you're not careful you will get 30 without even trying.  Also, go look up the perk list and plan accordingly.  Being pleasantly surprised is another way of saying willfully ignorant.  You stop getting perk packs and points at 50.  Maybe that was in a load screen somewhere.  I legit thought people were walking around with hundreds of S.P.E.C.I.A.L. points.  Nah, you get like 50 to spend and then you get to redistribute one each level after that.  Choosing to redistribute a point means you don't get to pick a new perk that level.  

[b] What I thought was fun. [/b]
Energy weapons.

[b] What the game meant was fun. [/b]
There are no energy weapon specific perks that affect the performance of energy weapons.  Many enemies have energy weapon resistances far higher than their ballistic resistance, to the point where the weapons don't really make sense in-universe.  This laser rifle uses more expensive ammo, isn't much more accurate, lighter, or damaging than it's ballistic counterpart.  Yes, the pistol does 30 damage compared to the 10mm 22, but when common enemies have a ballistic resistance of 100 and an energy resistance of 360, what are you actually saying when you tell me 30 damage?  It would be fine if it were consistent in some way, like against robots, but it's almost universal.  The decision to use energy is generally the wrong one.  There are many flavors of damage in this game, but only ballistic tastes good.  

Also, the distinction between ""Shotgun"" and ""Rifle"", is still kinda messed up when it comes to energy weapons.  Putting the beam splitters on still doesn't make it a shotgun.  ""Pistol"" in this case means ""Gun without a stock.""  It's a minor quible but it's still dumb.  Also they still haven't brought the plasma cascade perk back.  

[b] What I thought was fun. [/b]
Rolling for legendaries.

[b] What the game meant was fun. [/b]
Go look that up too.  The quirks on legendaries are separated by table.  The combinations are limited.  Also, good luck getting a legendary version of the gun you want, much less the quirks you want on it.  I've wanted a laser rifle with three quirks on it and it keeps handing me hand crank gatling guns.  Instigating (double damage on first strike) and Anti-Armor are mutually exclusive.  Don't waste your time waiting for it.

[b] What I thought was fun. [/b]
Selling things; the abundance fantasy of the apocalypse. Almost everyone is gone, so almost everything is yours.

[b] What the game meant was fun. [/b]
Every vendor in the entire game can sell you a grand total of 1500 caps per day.  You can buy stuff from them and a portion of that sale can be added onto that cap, but the difference can't exceed this limit.  In addition to this, there's multiple currencies with no set exchange rate, the most infuriating is legendary scrip.  You can sell unwanted legendaries for 150 scrip.  A three star weapon vends for 40.  If you get more than three a day, you can either hold on to it until tomorrow or just abandon it.  In short, the game (much like in example 1) wants you to simply remember everything is disposable.


[b] What I thought was fun. [/b]
Narrative interactions with NPCs with meaningful choices.

[b] What the game meant was fun. [/b]
Agreeing with NPCs or agreeing begrudgingly with NPCs.  There's this thing the game does where it cites stats other than charisma for speech checks, and I actually really like that, but I need [i]way[/i] more of it and I need it to have an effect on the outcome beyond occasionally additional caps.


---
There are parts of this game that are really pretty good.  The questing is fun.  The exploring is fun.  This is the best looking Fallout game without question.  The base building is reasonable if a tad clunky.  I've seen some real nice player bases.  It's still kinda buggy.  Less so now than in the past, but now it's a dice roll to see if your machine breaks or the server does.  But the whole thing is kinda plagued by the clear potential it has.

In the good timeline, Fallout 76 does a lot of what it's doing now, and what I'm sure it will do in the future, but at launch.  In the good timeline, it also allows you to host private servers for free, never imposed a stash limit, and had no reason to charge for any type of subscription service.  

This is the third review I've written for this game because the fun in this game seems to shift so radically from one week to the next.  ""It's fine until..."" is the phrase I want to use for this game.  It's fine until your stash fills.  It's fine until the vendors run out of money.  It's fine until it crashes.  It's fine until the game finds a reason for you to stop playing, and it's really good at giving you a reason to stop playing.  You hit a point where you can't progress for the day, and that hard wall tends to be so absolute there's nothing you can really do about it except log out for the moment and come back later.

I can't recommend this game as a result, much like how you can't really recommend any live service because they're too protean.  I can't honestly say every new patch is an improvement.  The game I recommend (or don't recommend) today may be the game I  heartily endorse tomorrow, but I can't be that brave because Bethesda (Microsoft subsidiary or not) might decide in the next patch to lower or raise the energy weapon resistances or item weights or any other amount of crunch in the name of a balance I may never believe in.

So what I'm going to do is keep playing the game, figuring out where and what the ""fun"" actually is, but not recommending it because I can't agree with it on that point.  Doom's ""combat puzzles"" are where the fun is.  Terraria's exploration is where the fun is.  Planetside 2's teamwork is where the fun is.  If I try to tell you where the fun is in Fallout 76, I'm not sure you'd find it.",1597795356,1601352519,FALSE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,268,27,14081,2714,12417,1601849119

7,Fallout 76,76722187,english,"Should you buy this game or not?

If you enjoyed the gameplay of Fallout 4 such as the exploring and the combat, then you will enjoy this game too. It has a ton of places to discover and loot. The map is giant, full of places to see and it rewards you for exploring. If it's only the storyline and dialogue of the previous Fallout games that you enjoyed then I would not recommend this game. The campaign is nothing like that. The campaign feels more like the singleplayer campaign part of an MMORPG. 

The real money shop (atom shop):
The in-game real-life money shop is really not at all pushy. The devs want you to buy things for sure, but the only time the game advertises things is the moment you open the game, at which you just press skip and then you're through to the game's menu. The shop sells two types of things. Cosmetics and repair kits. The repair kits are simply kits that you can buy which allow you to repair your stuff without spending materials and without needing a crafting table.

The review:

I only started playing a few weeks ago so I don't know what the game was like when it fist launched, but I do know that it was a disaster. Well, I was given this game for my birthday and I've enjoyed the heck out of it now for a few weeks. When you start, you have nothing, the game puts you into the little bit of campaign that it has and the beginning of the campaign works like a tutorial. The tutorial doesn't feel tedious though - you are able to free-roam like any Bethesda rpg.

The game is very free-roamy and encourages exploring and rewards exploring.
The world, which is based in Appalachia in West Virginia in the US, is quite big and it's packed with locations. Some are easier/harder than others and you just gotta try your way around. If you get overwhelmed, just run, it's easy enough but the start area is relatively forgiving. The game NPCs and mobs scale to your level mostly, which has it's good and bad sides to it. The good thing is that everywhere is relevant to you all the time so you're being forced to stay in 1 area at level 1 and you're nto forced to stay in another area at level 100. You can go almost everywhere at every level. Another thing is that even though the levels scale, you still can't really go to harder areas because you simply don't have enough perks and gear to handle those places. You'll be able to handle a mole rat or a bandit at level 1, but not a Scorchbeast or a Deathclaw. The bad thing about the scaling is that, according to other players who played from before scaling was added to the game, claim that mobs like mole rats require more hits to be killed now, compared to before scaling was added. I think the levels scale up infinitely? My friend who gave me the game is level 130 and I've seen random players who are more than level 400.

The game has player housing. Really good player housing.
Early on, I discovered you can set up your C.A.M.P. This is one of the best base building/player housing I've ever seen in an online game. It works exactly like Fallout 4's settlements, only it has even more things and you can place it literally anywhere in the world that you want. You can also move the camp any time, anywhere for a very small in-game fee. Some places are better than others because it kinda sucks to establish your base on a slope or in a really rocky location. You can overwrite your stuff on smaller rocks and trees and bushes though. The building of the camp uses snap-on building for assets like floors, walls and fences, but you can release it and free-hand it all by moving the cursor around a bit. You can build a ton of different things. There's walls of different materials, same with floors and roofs. Then you have production stuff like crops and farm animals, there's electricity stuff (very simple to set up compared to games like minecraft and no man's sky), you can set up a water pump, a water purifier (to avoid radiation damage from the natural waters), you make crafting stations for weapons, armours, ammo, chem stations for brewing drugs that give buffs and there's a few more stations I haven't mentioned. There's also just simple decorative items like rugs, paintings, sculptures etc. The crafting ties in with the base building - it's really good and I've spent a lot of time on it.

For the camp, you don't have many things you can build to begin with. You need to explore to find 'plans' and 'recipes' to unlock things. For example, you start with a bedroll and wooden floor tiles, a stash and stuff. Then, later on you can unlock more interesting things. The way you find the plans is by exploring, you can find them in any locations on tables, in cupboards. You also get plans from doing random events that occur around the world.

The combat feels basically exactly like Fallout 4. I personally prefer playing with a controller. It feels better and has some satisfying vibration moments (no innuendo intended). So far, I'm level 35 and I'm putting a lot of my perk points into melee weapons (you get a perk point every time you level up where you choose an attribute and a perk) because I find that finding ammo is kind of scarce compared to how much you use. I craft some ammo but it's relatively expensive to do so. By the way, there's nothing you can buy in the atom shop that accelerates the acquisition of items. Anyway, the acquisition of ammo is okay, it's not super scarce but not super abundant either, you have to use it wisely sometimes. But, back to the combat. You can play in 1st person and aim through the scopes or you can play in 3rd person and the camera will simply zoom in when you aim. Aiming increases accuracy as well. You can sneak as well and your first few attacks on enemies while sneaking will do 2x damage as sneak damage (even more damage with the right perks). There are perks for different weapon types like ""10% extra damage with non-automatic rifles"" and all those kinda things so you can specialize but I feel like you kinda have to keep different types of weapons anyway because they have separate ammo types (mostly) so you kinda have to keep a variety of weapons. You can use the best weapons for the harder enemies and the junky weapons on junky enemies. Fallout players will be familiar with the V.A.T.S. system. It's still there but obviously it doesn't freeze the game because it's online. Instead it works like an auto-aim, allowing you to button mash the trigger while it aims for you. The game still has the % chance to hit in VATS which caps at 95% so if the enemy is in your face, you may as well just shoot from the hip rather than using VATS. Increasing Perception attribute increases the accuracy, Agility increases the amount of shots you can shoot in VATS and there's also a perk you can pick which allows you to select limbs which is really useful at certain times.

The game is multiplayer, but you still play singleplayer mostly.
You always get placed in a server with up to 7 other people, making 8 people per server. You can see other player's camps on the map and also fast travel to them (Fast travelling costs a fee except to your own camp). Every player can also set up vending machines where they can sell any item they want for any price they want. Some players sell stuff for the default price the game sets them - don't buy those, it's too expensive, lol. For example someone trying to sell the plans for wooden tables will try and sell it for like 350 when in reality it wouldn't sell for more than 10.

10,Fallout 76,76299799,english,"Sigh, where to even begin.

This game was once a fully open sandbox game in a Fallout world.
Except for a few MMO elements (like public quests/events) it was pretty much a Fallout 4 but with friends.
Something that we've wanted for a very long time.

The key aspect (imho) to any open world sandbox RPG is that it shouldn't force you down any particular paths when it comes to builds or the way you play. Choice is key here. You should be able to play it almost however you want without the game blocking you or becoming too tedious due to the choices you've made.

- Want to focus your character on crafting and building? No problem.
- Maybe you wish to spend some time just running around an area with your newly crafted hunting rifle and complete leather armor set? Perfectly viable. Sure you ain't gonna topple an Assaulttron or a Deathclaw with that setup but that's hardly ones intention at that point anyway.

After one wasteland Fallout 76 has been turned to yet another auto-scaling generic RPG.
Complete with my all time favorite side effect:

""Ding! Level-up! yay! Erm.. why did the monsters I'm currently fighting just became harder to kill? 

Ahh.. thats right they just leveled up with me (for some reason!?) and now my gear is no longer the correct level so I just became WEAKER. "" A level up should mean you just gained more power not less.. This is just stupid.

Oh and you know that nice feeling you get when you finally acquire enough power and gear to be able to survive somewhat effectively in a new area? 

Yeah.. that is now completely gone. No matter where you go most enemies are now same-level bullet sponges unless you mold your character into the Terminator. And even then you better pick the correct build with the correct weapons or it wont much matter. Because some weapons are currently downright useless. 

Don't like using automated weapons, heavy weapons or power armor? Tough luck. That's where it's at currently.

You can forget trying to build your character for crafting, gathering, building or exploration.
Because if you do go down that path you'll have to waste so much time and bullets that you'll go nuts from the futility of it all. Most gather runs will eat so much ammo that the majority of the resources gathered will go into to resupplying your ammo. This happens even if you craft yourself armor and guns that is always of the highest level you can use.

Please give us back the wasteland we had and if that is not possible at least give us an option to NOT auto-scale when hosting a private server. That ought to be the solution where both sandbox/casual and power players can get what they want.

Because we (speaking mostly for myself and my friends here). Want a wasteland where levels matter. Where I know that an adult Deathclaw probably wont be below level 40 while a young one is rarely above 20. With radrats and bloatflies being at most level 5 and ghouls perhaps 10. With some legendary or special enemy types in-between (though we wouldn't be against having something scary enemies wandering in a low level area sometimes, to spice things up).

We want a wasteland where we can choose what type of content we want to experience and how. Using whatever character build or gear we want. Be it trying to engage bullet spongy deathmachines with a pipe pistol (not expecting to win of course) or one-shotting ghouls and radroaches. 

The choice should be ours. Which until the last update, it mostly was.",1600634365,1601302443,FALSE,12,0,0.569872856,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,699,3,6876,1233,5642,1601738094

15,Fallout 76,72933634,english,"Just disappointed.  (From a PVE standpoint)

[Edit- because I want to like and play the game]

Please allow a separate section for Utility Perks.  It's highly annoying constantly swapping perks around.  Just let us have extra utility perks for QoL.  

Say, at level 50, you get 25 extra utility perk points to add, and then every 5 levels or so get one more point.  The game should get better and less aggravating the more we play and level up.  
This is totally necessary because in order to have enough damage to kill enemies at higher levels we can't use any QoL perks.  But we still need to swap some in to do things, and then others we just don't ever get the benefit of like armor and weapons breaking slower, etc.  
This game is just too frustrating to play without QoL perks, and unplayable if you use them. 

The perk card system is just unnecessarily too limiting.  It's not like we can be OP even if we have every single perk.  And if that were possible then it should be balanced.  We should be able to use these utility perks that we spent points on and the other cards we bought...  It's called having more/progressing/rewarding/less frustration for getting further in the game!

**and for crying out loud increase the stash limit!  
The too limiting perk system and extremely limiting stash amount are the biggest reasons I don't want to play.

I love the Fallout series and I love TES, but Bethesda is going down hill with this sell out tactic in ESO and FO76.  

 And dangit, don't get me wrong, I want Bethesda to make money to keep making content, and enjoy it!, and I certainly hate seeing other game developers, especially mobile game devs, getting massively rich with exploitive micro-transactions (because there's science behind the psychology of getting people to spend money- it's exploitation) and good companies that deserve good return have to work harder for it.  But ethics and integrity still matter to most of us. Trying to steal my money with immoral tactics is something many of us will rile against.
 (That's mainly meant for the shady companies not Bethesda, they aren't that bad, I just hope they don't get worse.  Please just find better ways to get extra money.  Don't be like thieving mobile games.  No gambling, or dangling highly wanted/needed content behind paywalls.  Release it with a DLC if you must.  Keep micro-transactions to customizatons.)
I wish something would be done about the other companies' exploitive tactics. ]

Also, I think Bethesda is focusing too much on PVP.  Maybe this game was just made for pvp players and people like me who aren't big on that should have skipped  the game.  Well, I did up until now with Wastelanders out promising a cool game.  But the whole PVE game is still pretty pointless...  beyond the fun of getting better gear and killing monsters.  I felt kind of adrift, and eventually like continuing was pointless.   I mean I suppose I got plenty hours from it, but most of that I was a bit frustrated.  

I realize PVP was a part of the game. And I knew it was online and you played with others and back then it just didn't appeal to me.  But I love Fallout, so when Wastelanders promised a pve aspect I gave in.  Maybe I'm just being naive and should have figured they would still mostly just care about the pvp aspect.. idk. I don't think so.  It seems like a major portion of player base wanted this as much as I did. The Pve/co-op normal Fallout.  So I figured they re-focused.  

The problem with any PVP game, however, is that it's very demanding on the game developers.  Balance and exploits are constantly an issue. As it keeping people interested with more updates and changes and balancing those!, and dealing with constant feedback from players because PVP is much more hectic and emotional.  So less attention goes to the PVE side. 

[original- mostly]

What really ticked me off the most is the is huge slap in the face with this 'fallout 1st' business... The worst part about the game is constantly dealing with over-encumbrance, and the fact that I have to spend MORE TIME managing my inventories than I do playing the game...!  It's just frustrating and ridiculous.  You get such a tiny weight limit, even for your settlement storage! and you fill it up before you're lvl 10.

Most fallout players are collectors and hoarders and we like to show off what we get... Well, you can't do that anymore, cuz putting up guns or collectibles at your base counts against your tiny weight limit.  So you have to always scrap/sell/drop your cool guns and items to make room for more.  Ammo and junk weigh you down.  Guns have totally disproportionate weights and there's so much ridiculousness I don't want to get into it.  My base storages should not share a weight limit!@  
So, Bethesda, being the ""new and impr-"" (Sell Out) that they've become, decided on a way to cash out extra by infuriating everyone, and then saying ""Hey! Tired of the encumbrance irritation?  Well now you can pay us $12.99 a month and we'll reduce that irritation for you!""  (haha suckers!)
....!
This package to steal your money is something that should be free in the game!  Even the private maps are something many games offer for free.  Ty ARK: Survival Evolved. 
It's an even more disappointment because I kept seeing this tent and junk storage waiting til I got to the right level to acquire it and lessen this stupid burden, only to find out you have to PAY 12.99 a MONTH for it...   Ugh. ffs. 

I love the Fallout series and I love TES, but Bethesda is going down hill with this sell out tactic in ESO and FO76.  

I read the reviews that say the game got tons better with the Wastelanders addition, so I finally got it hoping for something fun.  It was fun and cool somewhat, but oftentimes frustrating.  It's basically just a DLC of FO4, made MMO/PVP with an infuriating trick to try to milk you for more...
If they added this as a cheaper addon, like 2.99 one time purchase, I would have got it and not been too mad. (upset on principle)  But the 12.99 monthly is totally absurd for something that should be free, something that should be a reward for progressing in the game at least.  

And how about for most of us who don't want the private servers but can't live without the stash space and tent drop??!  I can understand a small fee for private servers, if you need to milk people, but its not reasonable to charge this for the other items that everyone desperately needs and should simply be an in-game reward.

Edit
[At this point I don't care about the transaction.  continue milking people who are rich/fool enough to part with their money so easily because I want Bethesda to do well and keep making the games I will enjoy.  Just please don't ruin normal TES and Fallout games.]

But it feels like they took a huge hodge-podge of various elements and stuck them together, and even though I got it 50% off on sale I kind of regret buying it. Its plagued by bugs and glitches and makes a mockery of the success they had with fallout 4. It comes across as a desperate cash grab 

If you liked fallout 3, fallout new vegas, and fallout 4, this game will probably disappoint you because it has little to none of the mechanics that made those games fun and playable.

Theres no real storyline or plot, its just an endless grind where they try to get you to drop real world cash on their store to buy pointless skins. The score on metacritic for fo76 is abysmal as well.

One of the WORST bugs i experienced first hand is they have you build an incredibly detailed camp, you go to move your camp, and no matter what you do or try they will not let you place the camp anywhere due to a bugged world and you literally have to start from scratch and re-build your entire base. Its one of the biggest bugs in the entire game and still isnt fixed to this day. Good luck building your base because youre probably going to lose it one of these days when you try to move it somewhere else on the map. One of the main points of fo76 is the ""camp"" you build and they cant even get moving that right.

Also, I just absolutely hate their god-awful main menu. The game is full of some beautiful locations and instead of featuring those, the main menu looks like a trash dump. I just hate how they picked the ugliest damn main menu ever. Totally unlike bethesdas other main menus.",1601144893,1601160763,FALSE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,479,6,4337,5,4334,1601863813

It's the only game of its kind. This game is still really good 400 hours after I said it was last time.

Rich ass world, complex gameplay, and there's  lots of things to do that are really rewarding. Get it now or be jealous of all the higher level players once the microsoft money comes thru and you inevitably get it later.

I was only wasted once because I got a wanted flag by accidentally opening someone's metal container that was in a factory with in indicators that it was owned by another players but I stripped and set out to be killed by another player. 

The exploration and discovery is Fallout and the atmosphere and ambient music is perfect, gives the Fallout vibe. May update as I get deeper i to the game.

Update:
As the longer and deeper I got into this game it ends up being a grind fest to collect lead and supplies to proceed to farm more mats and mobs to hope for a new and better weapon or armor. Sure there are some things in game to help but it seems small. Single outing can use about 5000-6000 rounds of 5mm, once that is done time to grind another day so i can repeat again.

Visually, this game is gorgeous and 10/10

However that is ruined by the extremely slow server response times, desync issues and poor optimization. Every grenade, molotov, and throwables take like 2 whole seconds to register as thrown but the enemies you're throwing stuff at dont desync so you miss more often than not. Health bars take too long to calculate resulting in wasted ammo because ill think my shot misses so i fire another shot and it ends up just hitting a dead body. Then with a upper middle tier computer, i can only peak at 72 FPS at any given point but as soon as i see water, or enter a town/settlement that drops to like 40 and thats on medium settings.

ABOUT THIS GAME
Bethesda Game Studios, the award-winning creators of Skyrim and Fallout 4, welcome you to Fallout 76, the online prequel where players can work together, or not, to survive. Under the threat of nuclear annihilation, you'll experience the largest, most dynamic world ever created in the legendary Fallout universe.

Reclamation Day, 2102. Twenty-five years after the bombs fall, you and your fellow Vault Dwellers -- chosen from the nation's best and brightest -- emerge into post-nuclear America. Play solo or join together as you explore, quest, build, and triumph against the wasteland's greatest threats.
Key Features
One wasteland For All, Featuring Armor Ace!
Experience all that the Appalachian Wasteland has to offer no matter your level. Combat and rewards are rebalanced for your level, so players can easily team up to explore the entire world. Also, rank up to unlock rewards with the new Armor Ace S.C.O.R.E. board, earn new scaling rewards with Daily Ops, and create powerful new builds with high level Legendary Perks!
Howdy, Neighbor!
Wastelanders is a massive free update to Fallout 76 that fundamentally changes the Wasteland. One year after the opening of Vault 76, other humans have returned to Appalachia. Factions of Settlers and Raiders aim to make the world their own and claim a rumored fortune. Embark on a new main quest of choice and consequence, interact with characters and their unique stories, discover the faction settlements of Crater and Foundation, and collect powerful new weapons and armor. Your choices decide their fates.
You Will Emerge!
Create your character with the S.P.E.C.I.A.L system and forge your own path in a new and untamed wasteland with hundreds of locations. Whether you journey alone or with friends, a new and unique Fallout adventure awaits.
A New American Dream!
Use the Construction and Assembly Mobile Platform (C.A.M.P.) to build and craft anywhere in the world. Your C.A.M.P. will provide much-needed shelter, supplies, and safety. You can even set up shop to trade goods with other survivors. But beware, not everyone will be quite so neighborly.
The Power Of the atom!
Go it alone or with fellow survivors to unlock access to the ultimate weapon - Nuclear Missiles. This destruction also creates a high-level zone with rare and valuable resources. Do you protect or unleash the power of the atom? The choice is yours.
The Nuclear storm Approaches!
Nuclear Winter is a 52-player PvP Battle Royale mode, free for Fallout 76 players. Nukes have set the world ablaze and the battle to claim your spot as Overseer of Vault 51 has begun – will you be the last one standing or be consumed by the ring of fire? Rank up, unlock exclusive perks and build your C.A.M.P. to weather the storm in true Fallout fashion. Scavenge for weapons, supplies, and nukes to take on other players and creatures and earn unique cosmetic rewards.

3,Fallout 76,72363522,english,"edit: the One Wasteland Update ; aka Player Damage Nerf, aka Season 2 : Sep 2020 Welp, Bethesda did it again. [h1] They made my funnest build, a lazy casual bargain basement S-Mart Boomstick (the Ash survivor build from Evil Dead) self build, useless with this 'update'. [/h1] Ok, not completely useless, but sure as hell NOT FUN ANYMORE. Now i die all the time from full health, it takes 3 times longer to kill everything everywhere, much more ammo used, more mats to repair guns and armor that break more often, more time to rebuff after every death ... And I yet have no problem killing mobs and not dying if I wear power armor and use cheese heavy weapons, even If i'm NOT spec'd to use that stuff, go figure.[b] So to me it looks like this entire NERF was solely based on ""optimising"" the game around the L33T lvl 600+ players with hacked Legendary Weapons, and normal over powered weapons gated behind reputation and end game currencies. [/b] ... And the broken missions, fast travel, glitches, hacks, server issues and etc are all still around to varying degrees. It would have been nice had Bethesda worked this hard to fix more of these problems instead of rewriting core gameplay mechanics and buggering some us without lube.[b] It looks like Bethesda has lost yet another subscription. Kudos.[/b]---------------------------------------older - review update after 80 hrs : [b] WARNING, incoming wall of text. [/b]  [h1] I still DO NOT recommend Fallout 76 because of serious PC Fallout 76 Server breach exploits that allows a players stuff to get stolen. [/h1] I have my other reasons to ""hate"" on Fallout 76  , but this ""hacking"" problem is real and it makes Fallout 76 on PC a game of Russian roulette. Its an expensive ""live service"" without the content you would expect for that price tag because you need to pay to play safely. [b] This is some 'Chucky Cheese' level B.S. Pete, what gives? [/b]  More on this problem further below. I found some useful F76 performance tips to tweak my settings from other players and I no longer stutter even on this older rig.  And all my crashing issues are gone since then. The last 60+ hrs was not the nightmare I went through with my first 10 hrs trying to play. I do see myself enjoying another score of hours of play time ... but not on public servers even though I liked playing with randoms. It's just not safe. I'll get to that more below.I liked exploring and looting as I explored the 'story's' at my own slow pace. Some of the game environments and random encounters really are brilliantly done, they do feel like Fallout. But the story, ugh. It does feel like a ""Todd Howard"" story to me ... not very deep or captivating or inspiring. It's like he ran out of idea's from the past games to reuse as his own and had to come up with something new. *cough* Skyrim Dragons! .. oh wait, Scorchbeasts! Fallout 76 also suffers from an identity crisis with its Lore. Its trying to figure out how to ""make America Great Again"" when in fact in the Fallout verse America was THE dominant world military power who's elite were above all laws that governed the masses. And F76 is also trying to rebrand Vault-Tech as some sort of humanitarian corporation safe guarding the future of the United States when in fact the 'elite' used the vaults as a testing ground for human experiments as they watched from secret locations. I'm waiting to see how else they bastardize the Fallout lore to squeeze in more things to sell. But i havn't gotten to the end of the story yet ... maybe it all makes sense later?[h1] And worst of all, Fallout 76 suffers from to serious exploits & hacks on PC.  I personally feel it is NOT safe to play on public PC servers because of the possibility of someone stealing your stuff. Straight up taking what you are wearing right off your back. [/h1] And since the only solution to this problem, Private Servers, is pay walled behind the Fallout 1st subscription, it sucks on PC. Of course, if you never get robbed, YAY! But when you do ... and then have to deal with Bethesda customer support for hours if you want the stuff back if its possible. OK, and the last issue I have with Fallout 76 is how damn easy it is. I mean like I could go run up and kill a group of super mutants at lvl 2, wtf ? Did 'they' put something in the water in Vault 76? Yarp, its just so damn easy ... and its so rediculouosly easy to get OP. You really do not need OP weapons, just S-Mart level gear makes you a SPACE MARINE , oops, wrong game. OK thats about it. I'll edit this review again if things get worse with the hacking exploits, if it gets fixed, if it gets more fun, or if Bethesda decides they need to charge more money for more new stuff down the road even after sucking all this money out of me already. Time to play more :) [h1] Good luck, have fun & stay safe [/h1]---old, 1st Review, NOT paywalled ^^ jk ---5 hours of playing Fallout 76 in July 2020 and i can say that I've already run into game breaking bugs. I did some researching and it turns out a new exploit is causing server wide problems. [h1] Fallout 76, the game, was just wrapping paper for the real product, the Atomic Shop. [/h1]  Todd Howard did not create the Fallout verse, and it shows as he strip mines the Fallout franchise for profit.[h1] I will try again and I will return to edit my review as I play more.

6,Fallout 76,76322133,english,"When Fallout 76 first came out I had very poor impressions of it, and like most people, avoided this game like the plague. Then the Wastelanders update dropped and I decided to grab it while it was on sale and give it a try.  Since then, this game has been a go-to in my Steam library.

In terms of the story, if you're expecting a great storyline and campaign, you may find yourself disappointed. It is serviceable, but it is nowhere near some of the greats like Fallout 3 and New Vegas. One huge positive of first playing through the campaign is the exploration. The map of Appalachia is massive, and contains tons of POIs that you can discover and travel between. As you're exploring, you'll also come across the creatures of the wasteland who are designed very well and are disgusting and scary in their own right when you first encounter them.

The MMO aspect of this game is hit or miss depending on what you're looking for. If you desire a deep multiplayer experience with large player markets, central hubs, and endgame group activities, Fallout 76 leaves much to be desired.  However, if you have ever just wanted to play Fallout with your friends, I think 76 does that pretty well. There are groups you can join now if you prefer not to solo everything, different events that constantly pop up around the map that bring people in the server together, and bases (C.A.M.P.s) you can build that people can visit and buy stuff from whenever.

Overall, there is no doubt that Fallout 76 is a flawed game, but I think it is definitely misunderstood and does not deserve the backlash it continues to receive because of its rough release.  If you are a fan of Fallout, or have ever just wondered what it would be like to explore a Fallout wasteland with friends, I believe you will enjoy this game.",1600680991,1600680991,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,127,3,36644,3214,32536,1602044408

8,Fallout 76,74113296,english,"(EDIT: Updates detailed in comments)

There's a lot to say about Fallout 76... I should start with the fact that I completely misunderstood it until I played it. Fallout 76 is not a normal MMO. It is really an expansion to Fallout 4 with a new map and an always active online co-op mode. It is much closer to 12 other goofballs playing Fallout 4 at the same time as you than any classic MMO.

In fact, you could do most of this game and never notice you're online except for the standard Bethesda glitches being multiplied by an online framework. You're still wasteland garbage collecting, but the engines all feel a little tighter. The loot is leveled, but unlike most western RPGs, the power scale isn't too bad. Enemy health bars never feel too long unless you are totally undergeared. If you play smart, you can sometimes get away with blasting stuff outside of your level. The gunplay from FO4, for better and for worse, is here. The ragdolls and gore are satisfying and the weapons feel as good as they can for shooting into enemy health bars. But it's still Bethesda Fallout, so there is almost no meaningful player skill component and most fights still come down to you being able to tank hitscan damage and munch stimpaks. And should you die, there is literally no penalty. You simply respawn and go grab your loot. A few bosses make some serious effort at trying to feel like a real game with attacks you can dodge but they are few and far between. Unfortunately the game has the irritating habit of staggering you when you take any meaningful amount of damage. When you are at low health you can get staggered two or three times in a row, interrupting healing, movement, and reloading. It is a terrible mechanic that even further removes skill from the game, but if you have been playing Bethesda games this long, you have to take the good with the bad

Fallout veterans have long complained Bethesda took the lore of Fallout and gutted it to serve as an aesthetic for wasteland garbage collection and those folks are still vindicated here. The whole game feels a lot like Bethesda just realized nobody was finishing their TES/FO games and just made this one without an ending. The base game's story revolves around everyone being dead and having automated their lifes' work with robots and audio logs so you can iterate through their issues without talking to anyone. This works for half the game, juxtaposing do-gooders plans to help the wasteland next to their charred corpses and ruined dreams. (Note well, for all my talk, there is a lot of writing here to back some of this up. Bethesda did not just phone this story in. There are a ridiculous amount of computer text and audio logs in this game.) The plot goes off the rails when you meet a robot Harley Quinn and from there until the end of the game it just feels like you're fast travelling around to stuff you've already cleared when you were enjoying the exploration to grab pointless macguffin trash. Nobody asks you to kill 30 chickens, thankfully, but this crap is just as bad. Mercifully it rebounds with two real good dungeons at the end, but that's still quite a time to wait for a good level. By the end you've pinballed your way to the Enclave and BoS for no reason but not actually done anything but just opened endgame boss fights forever. (Note, they achieve a mostly corpse-filled wasteland by writing in a zombie virus, but you need not worry too much. They're not trying to be modern zombie garbage, mercifully. This game still has the spirit and earnestness of Fallout, at least Bethesda's flavor.)

That said, the current update actually adds NPCs to the game (And as a sign of Bethesda's love for the game, some pointless NPCs into the previously voice logs only story just for flavor. They care about this story, as awkward as it is, and I can't take that away from them.) and the NPCs have a slightly better questline that, again, doesn't really have an ending but introduces more endgame grind once you're done. For all I said Bethesda cares about this game, they managed to make faction NPC grind into teams of ""Settlers"" and ""Raiders"" which so BORING and mismatched as to be borderline malpractice. I sincerely hope the five or six dudes at Bethesda who cared about this story ground their teeth down to the nub at this awful management forcing of this crap factions. Also this story kills off in a really unceremonious manner the most interesting side character in the whole game. I felt cheated when I saw it happen so cheaply I could have blinked and missed it. That having been said, some of the quests here have some neat dungeons and gimmicks. There are a few pointless SPECIAL stat checks, and you aren't granted much freedom of options (Hell, most dialogue options are just you being a whiny jerk for no reason.), but they still manage to be engaging.

Of course if you don't care about the story, FO76 makes good on just having lots of stuff to explore or see, just like FO4. The world map is excellent, with some slightly more video gamey biomes and some excellent use of color in the environments. You'll use the photo mode quite a lot, to be sure, as the game is packed with beautiful stuff to see. It also makes good on the multiplayer component by periodically having co-op events. The game will announce an event and everyone may fast travel to it for free to join in. Most of these are just short, 10 minute shootouts, and they remain quite fun as something you can always do if you get bored of the exploration and want a little fast action and fast loot.

One thing that DIDN'T make it in from Fallout 4 was the settlement building. Here, building is just restricted to your ""CAMP,"" a portable home and fast travel point you can deploy anywhere on the map within reason. While mostly this functions as a base to store extra junk and throw up vending machines to sell stuff you don't need, the amount of cosmetics, both in the game and in the in-game Atom shop, is considerable. Building and customizing your camp is fun, whether you just want to throw down a few crafting stations and get on with it or if you want to build an elaborate houseboat on the lake.

Once you clear the story, though, the endgame grind is atrocious. You can launch nukes to summon the same boss over and over, which is interesting enough the first couple of times. But the faction and endgame currency grind involves you repeating the exact same ""Fast travel here, shoot X, return with Y."" mission twice a day every day forever. This is utterly criminal. Sure, you probably got 80 hours of loot and shoot content before getting here but you also didn't get an ending TWICE so I'll cry foul. 

Fallout 76 is better than everyone says it is, but at the same time almost everyone who says something bad about it is still correct. The shooting and looting is there. There is good content worth experiencing. But there is plenty of terrible fetch quests and even more bugs too. If you want a Fallout 4 experience with fewer people to talk to and less stuff between you and exploring ruins to collect garbage and more quick instanced shootouts played in coop, Fallout 76 will fit the bill. But it's still a Bethesda product so every interesting thing is accompanied by a boring thing, an awful thing, and a buggy thing. And if you're still mad about the jump from FO1-2 to 3... let me twist the knife: I joined the Enclave in this game ENTIRELY BY ACCIDENT.

(That having been said for all the flaws FO76's story is still far more respectful to Fallout than Disney was to Star Wars. In fact, this game is so earnest it feels like a breath of fresh air compared to so many game stories that just want to tear everything down. Bethesda likes Fallout and wants to do right by it, I think.)

(Also there is a battle royale mode. I have not talked about it. There is are several good reasons for that and you should pretend it doesn't exist yourself.)",1597113675,1600669634,TRUE,15,2,0.65408808,1,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,1866,425,16763,1739,9035,1602037722

- But there are still so many bugs:
• Low framerates and freezes in big cities. If you have to fight enemies in cities be prepared.
Half of the time your framerate will go down.
• Invisible enemies, it appened to me 2 times, and I died because I couldn't fight back. It's just hopeless.
• Invisible/appearing structure. Sometimes it can happen. An area, with a car, barrels etc just blocking you from walking further, after 5mn it appears finally.

It really feels like a fallout game now. Not quite as polished storywise but it does have coop which is fun. My favorite part has always been wandering around and finding new things so this fits really well.

However, one thing makes me not recommend it especially with the new patch. The new patch increased level scaling for all enemies while also lowering all damage (modifiers are additive instead of multiplicative). This really isn't a big deal. But what is a big deal is.....

HACKED WEAPONS. They are EVERYWHERE and people use them constantly. You'll see 5+ people, all level 400+ using hacked weapons to one shot endgame bosses, regular mobs, really anything. It completely ruins everything especially since you can't get loot if you don't tag mobs or do enough damage to them. Given the high level of these players, it means they've been playing for a long time and also means Bethesda has done nothing about it.

So the end result is it's just not worth it unless you like playing games like the early 00's when there was no anti-cheat at all.

I feel like there are devs behind this game who truly care about it, trying to add new content and satisfy the players. However, even if one overlooks the sheer amount of bugs and glitches in this game, the underlying principles and mechanics that Bethesda has implemented in this game is just completely unforgivable, and I'll try to summarize.

First, there are daily caps for literally all types of currency in this game. There are mainly 4 types of currency (including reputation) you have to keep track of almost every day if you want to make the most out of your time. Caps, legendary scrip, gold bullion, and faction reputation. These are all HARD capped every day, meaning no matter how much you grind, you'll never get above a certain amount every day. This is atrocious. I don't think you can really compare this game to other games-as-a-service type games, since it has open-world and survival elements built into it, so the caps on all these currencies just makes playing it a huge pain in the ass.

Second, the scrap box being locked behind a payed monthly subscription. The scrap box is essentially a required resource to really play this game more than just a fun side-game. Bethesda's decision to put it in a paid subscription basically dooms the entire game in my opinion. As long as this feature persists, this game will always reek of corporate greed and disregard for game-play, players, and their feedback. There is really no excusing this decision.

Unfortunately, I don't see any hope of Bethesda changing these two fundamental mechanics in the game, and they will continue to hold the game back. Even though I had some fun with this game, I simply cannot recommend paying any amount of money for a game that doesn't respect its players time, enjoyment, and money.",1591128207,1600387268,FALSE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,75,13,41453,149,40476,1601418038

When they launched wastelanders update and added NPCs it became a playable game for a fallout fan (although still with many bugs).  There were issues (mostly bugs) but it could be played as a Fallout RPG with some friendly other players roaming about.  It was my least favorite Fallout, but I still counted it among the series as a Fallout RPG. There was some pay to play stuff but it was pretty low key. Then Bethesda saw dwindling new player numbers and bored existing players (no real end game) and had to come up with a way to make the game stay profitable.  Instead of adding content or fixing bugs the choice was make it the same difficulty the entire play through by auto-scaling enemies to the player's level.  Existing players get tougher enemies and new players get easier ones.  This was the lazy cash-grab way out.  With enemy health scaling to the player's level all sense of progression is removed.  There is no such thing as returning to a place that was once hard and now finding you can navigate it easily.  The difficulty specific areas of the game mean nothing because all enemies are the level of the player, not the level they should be for the area.  I understand that letting new players do more is a great way to introduce new players.  The problem is there has never been an endgame except being strong enough to play the entire map.  Now you literally just shoot enemies close to your level everywhere.  The idea of an sort of character progress is totally erased.  This is now the same tasks at the same difficulty level the entire game.  Instead leveling the enemies to the player like this, a good RPG has a variety of areas, easy, hard and punishing.  This is not an RPG.  It's a Fallout skinned shooter that will stay the same level of difficulty your entire play-through.  If you want a fallout skinned shooter it might be playable but boring.  If you want an RPG this is not one.And then the bugs.  The game has been riddled with bugs since launch.  New features get rolled out that make Bethesda money and add paid features, but old bugs remain unfixed or are worsened.  The only bugs that get attention are ones that players use to get around buying things in the in-game store.  What's worse is that bugs that used to be tolerable have become game-breaking to specific types of player characters after hundreds of hours were put into setup by the player.  Currently the VATS system of targeting is broken to the point that any character that used it is not a viable build anymore. If you have built some types of characters enemies randomly gain health if you damage them too fast. So if you spent hundreds of levels crafting a player type that uses that system you can't play.  This game has been one blunder after another from the start and right when it was close to playable Bethesda decided that it was time to squeeze more money out of it.  So instead of adding content they just matched the enemies to the player's level and destroying the mechanics of character progression.  Tldr; Bugs, bugs, bugs, paid content gets more attention than game breaking issues, random changes designed at attracting new players break the builds of existing players.  Do yourself a favor and skip this fallout.

Which makes some really weird bugs and glitches in the game than can be incredibly frustrating (i have not encountered the Power Armor bug yet or the vendor because i didn't make a vendor in my camp yet). 2nd, the subscription. it has a big advantage over scrap/junk, if you are really good with item management with weight, then great, you don't have to buy this. for hoarders they will have a bad time. what they should do is keep either scrapbox or private worlds free and keep one in subscription and lower the price a bit. one of the most friendliest communities out there that will help you in some unexpected ways.

34,Fallout 76,76039305,english,"I want to start by saying while this is NOT a good Fallout game it is still a fun game.
In saying this I mean while it is set in the Fallout universe (Which was captured extremely well) it does not really a story that compares with Fallout 3 or NV or even Fallout 4. This is by no means a game where you will expect to play through a story, that was not the intended purpose of the game as much as it does truly suck. Fallout 76 provides a fun multiplayer experience inside of a well designed Fallout setting. Now you may expect the game to be ""grindy"" but it really is not at all. Leveling up was well done as it does not feel like it takes a lot of effort and more or less feels like you/your characters proggression through the game.

The Fallout setting I think is extremely well made. It feels fresh and full of classic feeling Fallout lore all over the place. The world is packed full of little details and notes everywhere. This was something that I think Fallout 4 really missed. There are so many stories and characters that the Wastelanders DLC added that are interesting to meet and follow their quest line. Another new aspect of Fallout 76's setting that I particularly like is how as updates roll out and as more factions like the Brotherhood of Steel move into West Virginia you can see this in the world. You meet people who are waiting for these factions entrance and it is interesting to see what will happen to these characters and West Virginia as these groups funnel in.

Many improvements on a technical standpoint have been made. Things like UI and graphics have been immensly improved. I really love the new UI, it is miles better than Fallout 4's retro style UI where it is literally devoid of any style. The lighting overhaul creates a beatiful new look to Fallout and I'm excited to see where these new graphics go in the future with Fallout 5.

In conclusion, while Fallout 76 had a terrible start I think that as this game has continued and more updates has been added I think this game is worth a TRY for people who enjoy the Fallout franchise and who are looking for a fun Fallout game while we wait for Godd Howard's Fallout 5 (Probably in five years :( ).",1600205739,1600205739,TRUE,1,0,0.518750012,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,71,27,5366,590,1851,1601043668

I feared that I wouldn't be able to get all the best weapons and armor quick enough due to all the time gates and caps in the game. Usually I would get on, play for about an hour, and then quit to play something else.

49,Fallout 76,76024321,english,"Overall, the gameplay itself is fun enough and it is pretty much like Fallout 4 multiplayer with a different story and map. However, there is a MAJOR problem that plagues this game and that prevents a lot of long term players. I think the system is currently designed to not encourage long term playtime, so as a result Fallout 76 does not have many long term players. The issue plaguing fallout 76 is the stash limit. 800 is just not enough. I have only played for a few weeks, yet in those few weeks, I have managed to fill up my account's stash and an alt account's stash. I am now full and I constantly have to worry about inventory management. For a game that encourages exploration, collecting, and hoarding, they punish you for doing just these things when you want to reap the rewards of your labor and limiting how much you can even have at one time. This stash limit sounds reasonable at first glance, but if you actually play the game, 800 is nothing and will be filled up in no time. I just hate that a game that encourages exploration and collection is so highly discouraging both by limiting so lowly what you can have. Even if I'm able to clear out some of my stash and empty some things, I will ALWAYS have to battle with my stash and constantly do stash and inventory management. How is this fun in any way? It detracts from the game, it doesn't balance anything out, and it just prevents players from playing longer than a few weeks and giving up after being frustrated with inventory management. 

If the stash issue is fixed, this game would be very playable and fun. But because of the stash issue, it is almost unplayable for me anymore. They should add a way to increase the stash limit or just remove it entirely. It should increase as you level up or pay caps to increase it. Better yet, remove the stash limit.

It's not as horrendous as it's commonly made out to be, but expect it to play exactly like Fallout 4 with improved features, diverse map and better systems etc.

The main highlight for me in the Fallout series is the exploration and FO76 definitely lives up environmentally. Each region is completely unique and filled with places to go with each place telling its own stories of what happened before and after. There's a lot of variety in things to collect too like food, guns, junk...

It's entirely possible to play this game solo and isn't too difficult - 145hrs in and only had good experiences with others

What's really daft is the storage and how its tied behind a pass. Don't get Fallout First. You'll probably reach the limit around level 25-30 but from then you just have to keep managing it. 800 is definitely enough to live by though and you can still hoard materials for repairs etc.",1600174092,1600174092,TRUE,0,0,0,2,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,236,1,8939,7,8736,1601133714

My machine doubles the system specs required, but this game is running on a 20 year old engine they work harder to keep limping along than if they just designed a new one. I sincerely hope people stop buying and playing these games, a couple of losses producing these sub par games and they would likely have to declare bankruptcy or sell the IP to a competent team of developers.

Some things have improved over Fallout 4 and the initial release, but I expected more.  The UI is still clunky and tedious.  It's like they copy/pasted Fallout 4, added some questionable MMO functionality, changed the world content and quests, took away essential stuff and put it behind egregiously overpriced microtransactions and a subscription, and called it good.  

The atom store and premium subscription seem shoehorned onto the game and force you to pay extra for things that should be included in the base game.  Bethesda needs to get more creative with charging more for actual added value.  I'm happy to pay extra for extra value, as long as it enhances my gameplay instead of just making it suck a bit less.

In my opinion this game is a good example of a ""money grab"" that just exploits consumers who have a fondness for the Fallout series.

BUT I have to hand it to Bethesda devs for doing what they've done so far, and continuing to add updates that make it a much more fleshed out game. 
the wastelanders update feels so ingrained in what it is now that it's hard for me to imagine what it would have been like without it. these NPCs add so much more life to this game and believe it or not, what lore there is is actually good and entertaining. 
I've run into a couple bugs in 50-odd hours of gameplay. it's been nothing unusual for a game with a world this big and that many players, and nothing game-breaking at all. all the while, bug fixes are issued monthly.
ultimately, I think it's a game that you should play, especially if you're a Fallout fan. I hope it's worth it if you buy it, and if you run into any troubles in the Appalachia wasteland, give me a ring",1591059759,1599782283,TRUE,0,0,0.476190478,2,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,49,25,6482,309,6105,1601952500

41,Fallout 76,71754898,english,"I enjoyed the game up to the point I finished the available quests. The stories were nice and there is a lot to explore on the map. After that, however, the game feels rather empty, spiced with some quite annoying game mechanics. 

-- Gameplay --

The ""endgame"" is rather repetitive: it is to collect different types of currencies to craft armor and weapons. Every single currency have daily limits, so it can take months even if you play every single day. This is most likely the aim of the limits in the first place.

Regarding the equipment, crafting is completely randomized (both the grade and the special effect type) so you may never ever get the ones you specifically want.
Looting is the same: defeating more challenging bosses does not yield better rewards (although, I think the currently most difficult boss, which has been put in the game like a month ago, does guarantee better grade rewards, but I am not sure about that).
Storage space is also limited, which results in some interesting dilemmas the player must face, namely: be absolutely sure about what equipment you want to get rid of, because you will probably never see it again (except for the ""Furious Walking Cane"" apparently). It also limits experimentation with different weapons and builds, which is not ideal for a game that wants you to play it indefinitely.

The storage- and time-locked currency limits present another, more serious problem: you cannot get rid of unwanted stuff at your leisure in a meaningful way.
This is one of the most unlikable game mechanics for me, because it - more often than not - ruins the number one purpose of the entire game: entertainment. It forces you to choose between three 'actions': throw away valuable resources; continue playing with a 'penalty' (combat and movement, including fast-travel, becomes limited or prohibited); or just stop playing and continue when the timelock (20h) ends.

It is important to note, there is also a monthly subscription service wich provides some serious benefits, one being infinite storage for one type of resource (but not equipment). At the time of writing this review, it is debated whether it may be considered as p2w or not, I think the benefits are enormous.

-- Game Updates --

The game, being a product of Bethesda, is riddled with bugs. It can be hilarious sometimes, but there are also some gamebreaking problems that makes you want to throw your PC out of the window.
And the worst thing about this is that some of these probably cannot be fixed at all.

The game is in a state where most players have finished all quests, so the gameplay and new content are tailored to keep them (and most importantly the subscription players) playing. 
Every once in a while, quality content is released in the form of new quests, which is good.
But most of the time, 'new content' manifests in the form of purchasable cosmetics or meaningless grinding events (eg.: the entire ""The Legendary Run"" season or the ""Fortifying ATLAS"" community event).

It seems that a large portion of the 'new content' is either an experimentation of new game mechanics, or an unfinished and unchecked spawn of an idea. One thing is for sure, this game lacks proper quality assurance.
Every single update I lived through, since I started playing this game, looked like this: a portion of the new content was either missing or broken; some already existing features broke and or new bugs manifested in the game; the bug they specifically said to be fixed by the update were not entirely fixed.

-- Battle Royale mode --

There is this thing as well. They made us play it to advance the battle pass. It is not my thing. Also, at one time, I found the online stream of a player who killed me, and was amused how I wasn't even aiming at them while firing, even though in my view I was. But I am sure it was totally my fault.

-- Bottom line --

So, yeah. I really want to like and recommend this game, and I do to some extent, but sometimes, it just doesn't work. 
Everyone has to decide themselves if they are willing to put up with the things that happen here.

-- EXTRA: The Legendarily Disastrous Run, that has ended but will not be forgotten --

What is worse than an endless grind? A time-limited grind. Some people say ""bUt YOu doN't hAVe to pLay iT"". Fair enogh, the rewards are mostly cosmetic and noone is actually physically forced to play the game anyway. You can just play the awesome other content, like the state-of-the-art, hacker-free, bug-free battle royale mode with perfect hit detection.
I don't like the implementation of this season, don't recommend it and this is the last time I am willing to take part in such thing.

I wrote this on the first day of the first season, admittedly being somewhat annoyed after checking out the ""content"" and doing some calculations:
"" ""The Legendary Run"" awoke in me my worst memories and feeling regarding p2w games. Before this, the challenges were fine, sometimes I did all, sometimes not, it was no problem. It is not like I wanted to buy everything for the Atoms.
Now, earning currency is replaced by a subgame that can even consume currency (yay, you can pay even more money).
I also feel that I have to do the challenges, if I don't want to fall behind. The endless grinding of the other 2-3 in-game currencies were not enough, Beth had to add another one.
Bugs are numerous, fixing them is priority only if they would make acquiring currencies easier. For everything else, you may have a ""sorry, we need to find more ways to the contents of your wallets first"".
Sure, I have seen much, much worse than this, but Fo76 is not a free game, so I expected better. I simply don't like where this is going. ""

I wrote this near the end of the third week: "" TLR looks like mostly what I expected back then. Let me just say this: ""The Legendary Run"" is not free, it is only available for free. It seems to be designed in a way that it can be finished if every single challenge is completed (including earning the repeatables due to level increase, and the extra daily challenges). Playing every single day is let's say challenging for casual players.
The missing ranks can be bought with cash. I mean Atoms, which can be bought with cash.

""But anyone can farm the repeatable challenge"" - they say. To do that effectively, you need a very-very specific gear and whatnot. It is virtually unobtainable by the time the season finishes.

Fallout 4, Fallout 3, Fallout 2, Fallout 1, New Vegas, Half-Life, Mario, Steam, reading reviews, when everyone is peaceful and having a good time, smiling healthy babies, a cure for cancer, sports, driving, a good book, exercise, or music

Keep in mind you don't have to like everything on that list. Even if you just like one tiny thing from that list, even a little bit, you'll like this game and you should spend your money on it.

This game contains:
-mini-games
-a lover's embrace
-cloth you get from shredding up books and they make you give it to the army
-missile launchers literally everywhere, too many missiles, it will take you two hours to farm 20 screws
-toxic water
-points and rewards
-locations and a main map
-historic vault 76
-food like cake, others
-you have to wait at the dmv

Also, this game is expensive, so it's good. You should buy the game and buy the year pass for Fallout 1st. That'll be way over $100 and I don't care if that sounds like a lot, it isn't. People gamble away fortunes every day. Make a sound investment, and get a game like this that not only helps you practice social distancing, but cripples your free time and makes you feel like a hollow shell of your former self. You'll lose healthy weight if you buy this game, and you will just start leaving dishes around, even if you are fastidiously clean normally.

When you play this game, and then once you are addicted and start ignoring your friends, when you play you will get a dopamine hit so hard it will feel like you're dying or that your mind is pulsating, and it makes you slap your daddy, but out of respect. If you slap your dad he will be mad at you. But if you tell him you bought this game he will forgive you right away which means you have a ""get out of slapping dad free"" card for buying the game, but only if you also get the expensive pass as well. You have to do this for a game object where you store junk, and if you don't have that one item I really hope you love micromanaging your inventory, pal. 

This game will make you:
-cry at the beauty
-strike your fancy
-get someone near you pregnant, but only if they want to
-feel real wise
-kick back and relax
-rock out at red lights to songs your grandmother says are old and silly
-this game will tickle your senses, but no taste or smell really, unless you imagine it or do weird role-playing stuff, but don't do that or you'll lose friends

-Lack of modding support [trust me i know this is an online game only and i actually have a few mods installed but the mods that do work for fallout 76 are very limited to only working on the bethesda.net launcher because the steam version is recently new]

-Really bad in game settings [Pretty much if u want to make your game look better or make it run perfectly you need to change your Fallout76.ini folder, look at this guide for the best help on this out there and it'll make this game so much better https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/593?tab=description

-Paying for private server [If your like me i hate running into other people in this game, i hate the message telling me someone has took my camp spot and so on, so if u want to play solo or with friends only its another 12.99 a month for that]

-Issues with the map if u dont cap your fps to around 120 if u use a controler [if i dont cap my fps i get an extreamly high fps in the map and the fps some how effects controler cursor speed in the map, so if u use a controler u have to cap your fps.

I have not noticed any bad issues with this game so for in the hours ive put in, i run it in 4K everything on high with around 80 to 90 fps outside with no massive frame drops and 120 fps cap indoors, but im running on a 2080ti, i9 9900k all over clocked

First off, you drop items when you die, which other players can take. Seriously? What year is this? There's a reason other online games stopped doing this by 2005. It's just annoying and makes it less fun. 

The game is still really buggy. It doesn't crash every 30 seconds anymore but you can see that it throws exceptions all over the place because it constantly freezes for a couple seconds while it tries to catch up. They just shouldn't have released a game in this state and it's pretty inexcusable that they still haven't really fixed it.

The world is poorly planned. You're just trying to do the lowbie quests and you constantly run face first into something 20 levels over you, which kills you, and then you lose your stuff if another player grabs it before you can get back. Online games from 15 years ago were able to plan out zones by level but Fallout 76 couldn't pull that off.

They made it easier to scrap junk items, and they weigh less. That's actually an improvement over Fallout 4. Buuuut they blew it by giving you way too little storage space. Mine was full by level 10, just from dumping my inventory so I could keep playing. The vendors pay next to nothing and there's zero player economy to speak of, since you can only communicate through emotes. The end result is you spend half your play time trying to sort though your inventory and offload stuff. Oh, and ammo takes up storage space but the vendors won't buy it so you'll end up having to drop it on the ground. Storage in Fallout 4 was unlimited. Oops. Of course you can pay a subscription fee for more space.

Building settlements was half the fun of Fallout 4 but that's gone from 76.

This is what made my hit alt-f4 and never log in again: I spent an hour farming some crafting material. Then I want to a vendor at a train station to offload my extra weight. While in the trade window some random mob literally 40 levels higher than me came out of nowhere and killed me with one shot. In the 10 seconds it took for me to respawn and get back to my death bag, someone already jumped on it and took the crafting material I just spent an hour collecting. 

This game really could have been good but apparently they spent zero time player testing it because it mostly just offers frustration and not a lot of fun.

npc questing is plain, and if u play as multiplayer, questing feels like not important at all
all new area i come is useless, no dialog, no npc, no background story ( except u collect holotape and questing via holotape)

conclusion : i know its better than before, but this game has a room for improvement.... even fallout 4 have WoW moment like Brotherhood come with airship and liberty prime, and this game? nah none of that.... nuke? nah its boring, even people farming them... 

suggestion : u need to make heavely scripted event raid with rich storyline like weekly raid (not public raid), you can populate town, and some twist. for the last you can bring faction war for contested teritory every 3 days maybe ( for the winner they can get loot or raid area )",1599259643,1599259643,FALSE,0,1,0.396825373,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,16,5,2315,0,2315,1597855528

I enjoy this game a lot, especially when playing with friends-- however, it's extremely disappointing and unsurprising that there's still many graphical and performance issues that still haven't even been remotely fixed that have been here since the beginning. We should not have to edit game files and go above and beyond just so we can use our hardware the way it's meant to be-- along with this their expansions, specifically Wastelanders-- while being enjoyable with all the new content it has added, it also shows how lazy the team is, the writing for NPC's is horrible and follows some of the worst story building I've experienced. When you go and make raiders claim ""We don't kill unless we have to"" while in the start you're constantly attacked, threatened, and their base is full of corpses of their victims-- you've gone down the route of laziness and complete lack of care for some decent storytelling at the very least.. Also the fact that while they constantly advertised ""choosing sides"" you don't get that option, the game forces you down the pathway's that the writers/devs want you to go- you're sitting in the sidecar, not driving. 

Wastelanders was a great addition, but has it's many faults. Least the Fallout world is feeling a little more like Fallout with the NPC's despite the wattpad tier writing.

I would put my rating on this game in the middle if I could, however-- due to the fact that I still have a lot of fun playing it, alone and with friends- I'll have to put it as a 'positive' until Bethesda inevitably breaks their game entirely because they're incapable of fixing things and do more breaking.",1599182419,1599182419,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,39,4,14115,1315,8597,1602047092

That's not even mentioning the way the home screen hounds you about whatever overpriced new items they add to the shop every week.

If this were a single player game that I could mod up, I'd probably still be playing, but I had to bow out before even finishing out the Wastelanders quests.

I want you to know that you severely screwed the pooch with this one. I have barely any words to describe how hardcore you f*cked up, Bethesda. From the shitty nylon bag fiasco, to the random banning. to the thinking you're in any place to ask for a public apology from people you've banned, to the nuka dark rum disaster. let me put this in no uncertain terms. YOU HAVE F*CKED UP. The fact the I have to pay a subscription fee in order to not get nuked by a level 256 tryhard confirms this. But most of all, I want you to know...

Millions of other fans had their hearts broken too. In fact I'm still a little angry at you. But it is also a deep sadness within myself. 

But you already know that. My Point is, you can do better. Don't listen to the soulless wall-street bankers who see you as just another investment opportunity. Listen to your fans. Listen to the ones who buy your games.

the game up until endgame is fun. but once you beat the story and finish all the sidequests, you're looking at a GRIND. 

the GRIND exists only so that you can eventually find the weapon/armor with the correct stats for the build you decided to make.

thats it. nothing more nothing less. and it took about 1-2 weeks to get enough currency to unlock the ability to craft ONE piece of armor. and then you have to spend MORE currency to be able to craft it. THEN you have to rely on RNG to give you a good roll.

Bethesda bullshit (✓)

Overall the game runs well, it's fun to play and even funnier with friends. lots of bugs but still playable, like any Bethesda game really. 
The PvP aspect is almost non existent so if that's what you're looking for don't get it. You will never kill another player unless you both have the intention to fight, you can only hurt each other if both players initiate combat, so no ambushes or ganking.
The Wastelanders update feels like an actual release of the game, while anything before that was early access or beta stage.
At first I thought the IRL currency shop would be pay to win. I couldn't be further from the truth. So far there are no items that will provide an advantage. most are cosmetics for your weapons, armor or camp. 
However there is an item that can be an advantage but it's so minimal I don't consider it one, Colectrons. These robot stations will automatically deploy a Colectron that will collect junk items  used for crafting. The rate at which they do it is really slow, but that's the only item in the shop that's not purely cosmetic.
You gain free Atoms (IRL currency format) through in game events, such as the free battle pass and others.

9,Fallout 76,75344536,english,"First of all, I´m not sure how exactly did the game look right after the release, however, started in August 2020, I can only recommend. Fallout has it´s flaws - bugs, rather old, Skyrim-like engine, not so great performance (I have Ryzen 2700X, 32 GB RAM, Radeon 5700 XT and I´m having unexplainable FPS drops, even though both GPU and CPU are constantly bored) 

Now, this game is still one of the kind - there are many survival RPGs and so on, however, none of them I played so far has such an awesome, detailed, ridiculous (in a positive way) and diverse open world. It´s huge and almost every location you visit is unique and has it´s own tale. It only needs time to go trough (much time). Moreover, obviously, it has multiplayer, diverse and enjoyable combat system and ""style."" Yes, the US 50s-like environment has so much to offer and if you enjoy that typical ""Fallout"" humour, you will laugh you r ass off, many times - and get heart attacks the other times because many of the locations are almost Outlast-like. 

Some of the NPCs could use some polishing, so the world would be more believable but I think if you create a game of so huge measures, you simply can´t make all NPC perfect, since it would require tremendous amount of resources and money. (I´m not saying Bethesda is poor but you know what I mean...). But in other words, hell yeah, if you hesitate, I´d give 76 a try.

12,Fallout 76,75328501,english,"I first played F76 on the XBOX1 from the day of release but with constant server issues, the restrictions on storage and a whole raft of other problems I soon abandoned the game. I really do like the modern fallout games (F3 onwards) and I had expected great things from F76, sadly I feel this game was a step backwards from F4. I have no desire for online/coop game play from a fallout game, I just like looting, story, quests and hording etc. 

I purchased the game again for the PC as it was going cheap and I already own all of the other games from the series on PC and I must say that the game feels more finished now with fewer of the irritations from launch day. But it really is a shame what they have done with the storage situation, I mean you can walk the wasteland with everything on your person, with the irritation of being slowed down intermittently (AP drain), and so why couldn't they simply allow unlimited camp storage?? Then I realised that they had released a monthly subscription for unlimited craft item storage... so that's why you cannot have unlimited storage by default... and being the fan that I am I have trialled this and it does help with storage in the main stash box but I also like to collect one of everything and have it stored but the limitation of the main stash does not allow for this so it only half solves a purpose built problem... I guess maybe soon there will be a separate subscription for unlimited weapon/armour storage.

The wasteland world itself is great and plenty big enough but I wish there were more NPCs within the world and perhaps I have gotten used to moving my camp around the map but it can be fiddly depending on the terrain you move to. The perk system is fun but somewhat complicated and a little too random (cards) for my liking.

Overall, I like the game as much as I wish to dislike it - just imagine if this had been F5 with similar mechanics to F4.... I would have clocked up hundreds of hours by now. In my opinion the online/coop should not be forced on you it should be an option and for those who chose not to use it should not be burdened by limitations put in place to enforce fair online play for all.

This game is like a survival lite game with some rpg/fps elements mixed in. I say lite because it's relatively easy to build a camp, find food/drink, etc. Plays a lot like the later Fallout games. If you like those you will probably enjoy this game even with all it's quirks and bugs.
 
Sometimes you'll appear offline to your friends, sometimes you'll be clipping into the ground and fall to your death, sometimes you'll go cross-eyed looking for the new CAMP item you got in the extremely cluttered UI, sometimes you'll be yelling at the screen cus Legendary enemies bodies vanish before you can get to the body to loot. But for all those negatives, there are some real shining moments of gameplay when you are with a team working together.

The community is very friendly and it's easy to make friends and find help, especially if you use a mic. There isn't a day that goes by that I don't notice someone helping out a lower level player. Lots of shooting, looting, scrapping, hoarding materials, base building, with the occasional PvP on the side.

35,Fallout 76,73886640,english,"I got this game for $20 and I regret it already. The AI is TERRIBLE meaning very little to no challenge, there are arbitrary limits everywhere forcing you to buy their Fallout 1st subscription which I absolutely refuse to do, LAG....... omg the lag no matter the time of day, half a spawned mob will not render in fully so there are empty enemies with some in T poses still and they won't fight you, can't. I'm only at lvl21 and I've already given up on this game. I've spent over a thousand hours in FO4 modded and vanilla, I know the mechanics, FO76 is just... it doesn't feel like a FINISHED game. I do like how they setup VATS for online use, though, that is handy. The bugs... they are everywhere. EVERYWHERE.

I don't like talking because I don't like humans. This game only has voice chat available so I can't really communicate with anyone. Would be nice if I could send a message then I could actually group up with more people and take on the group content. Emotes only get you so far especially if Bethesda wants you to pay for said emotes. I know there are mods for private servers but that requires the FO 1st sub or a friend running one but again... I don't like humans.

Even though a whole lot of people hated FO4, I loved it and I still do. I like the feel of FO76, the environment, the music, the Cryptids and lore behind them, but the gameplay itself is sub-par and not done. The CAMP building system was actually fun but go look up about what Bethesda has done in Update 21 (coming soon to Steam) and how some of the biggest builders in game are now jumping ship due to being so restricted with their options. I do wish there was a way to re-establish your camp (blueprint) but most of the time I'm restricted by the terrain. I've scouted quite a few CAMP locations but if I want to actually use that location I have to log in and back out half a dozen times because when I'm logging in someone's camp already occupies that space. I wish when logging in the game was smart enough to take into account the current location of your CAMP and when selecting a server to log into it would check for that. 

Wastelanders was a step in the right direction but we all know Bethesda can't keep that momentum going. They're going to screw it up just like they screwed us over time and time again.

The ONLY good thing about this game is the community..... seriously. This game has a lot of potential but in it's current state I cannot recommend this game (even at $20!). Bethesda is known for being a shady developer; suggesting a game that they released in this state (2 dam years ago and it's still not done yet) says a lot about what they think of their customers or what they're willing to lie about. Greed... ""it just works"" with ""16 times the detail""

UPDATE: After doubling my hours... there is something very satisfying about the grind in this game for me. Up to 28 now and exploring more of the map and I'm having fun. The lag is still definitely an issue as is the AI but bugs seem to be getting a little better. I'm not getting used to the bugs I'm just seeing less bugged out mobs and stuff. Still not ready to recommend this yet.

50+ HOUR UPDATE: Started a 2nd toon and started the grind all over again... and I'm yet again having fun. The grind is real, read the other reviews, but it actually seems to be my kind of grind. I like the slow progression. And in the next update we're getting pretty much a total battle re-balancing pass. This won't fix the STUPID AI problem but hey it might add a little more difficulty to the game. Check out JuiceHead's latest vids on YouTube for all the news and data-mined info from PTS.

250+ hours: This includes a lot of downtime (AFK) where I sat in workshops waiting for resources to build up before logging off. After 250+ hours I definitely feel like I got my money's worth with this game, I paid $20. I do not suggest paying anything more than $30 for this game. There really is no pressure to use the Atom shop and you're given PLENTY of opportunities to earn Atom for free in game. The Atom Shop is not a problem in this game. The problem is the lag. The problem is the HORRIBLE AI that is STILL laughable. Get a mob of 10+ guys, backpedal in a circle using VATS to one shot all of them with a shotgun. The upcoming patch will take this on though with a complete rebalance so we will see...

I still cannot recommend this game. Game still feels half done, while better, still not complete. Bugs are still prevalent. Now that I've hit 50 now I see the wall where Single-player ends and the need for multiple people begins and I don't like it unfortunately=( Everyone I've met in-game has been extremely helpful and my workshop was only trolled once but a little patience with a sniper rifle and a camo mod took care of that.

60,Fallout 76,75160165,english,"I started playing Fallout 76 with no special expectations at all. I actually … had a [b]good time[/b] !
You always have something to do (even more so when you start the game). There are lots of quests and events to participate in. But these activities or the combat is not what I appreciate the most in Fallout 76. It’s ... the [b]exploration[/b] ! The map is vast, varied and full of detail. Running around and discovering the map is really what I enjoyed the most. 

You can salvage most items lying around and use them as crafting materials. With enough materials, you are able to create gear, consumables and a base. Concerning this base, you can be creative with the location as well as it's design through the building elements that you have unlocked (in-game and through the shop).

I haven’t (and won’t) subscribe to Fallout 1st. The game is fully playable and enjoyable without it.
The [b]limited stash space[/b] is a bit frustrating at first but after some time, you’ll learn what you can sell and throw in order to make space for more important things.

The multiplayer aspect isn’t forced on you. It’s easy to team up with other players if needed. The emote system is pretty funny to communicate with others.

There are some [b]negatives[/b] I feel I have to point out.
The quests and characters aren’t gripping like some other RPG’s. 
The game has [b]bugs[/b]. They haven’t stopped me from progressing at least. They vary from your daily challenges not resetting to invisible quest markers and also include stuck NPC’s. 
Navigating through some menus can be a bit clunky at first.
The performance (framerate) can be inconsistent at times.

I feel like the game is [b]worth it on sale[/b] (with at least 25% off) for the exploration alone. The journey to improve your character is fun but I don’t see myself playing too much after that.

After a while however, I heard that the Wastelanders update made the game better, and I do think the game is entertaining, it just has a few things that don't quite fit. First of all, because Bethesda made the game grindier in order to get people to go to their in-game shop for things like repair kits, they reduced junk (at least useful junk) and added the condition system. Second, the bugs make it so the system isn't great at determining certain aspects based on levels, leading to situation where you might be in a situation you're way under-leveled for. Third, you have to have godlike patience for this game, because the amount of times the game either crashes, or causes a bug, leading to you restarting a difficult mission, is just disappointing.

I was unable to get the volume to the point to actually hear what was being said on all of the informational HOLO's that were meant to help you out. That probably will turn out to be an issue with my new HP gaming laptop. So, I will mention the issue, but not put it on the game just in case it is not the source of the issue.

The  C.A.M.P. system should be able to be picked up and redeployed later if you make a mistake in original placement (HOLO hearing issue to blame here).

Minor issues (some due to my deteriorating eyesight), the pip for where you are looking is way too small (would like the option of using a + or crosshair display), not being able to see the enemy (I end up walking right into them before they display on my screen, and the tiny pip does not help, never going to be a scout/snipper in this version of the game).

95,Fallout 76,72067621,english,"The atmosphere of the game is probably the best thing about it!
The visual and the ambient music takes you on an amazing adventure through the wasteland!

Pros:
The richness of the open world.( Divided in many different biosphere)
The C.A.M.P and gear modifications. ( A more complex version of Fallout 4 )
The mutliplayer input ( Playing fallout co-op with a friend is priceless! )
The constant work by the devs for new patches and fixes.

Cons:
Too many fetch quests and not enough main quests.
Lots of glitches( not only visuals but sometimes that prevents you from advancing the game)
The perk system which I think should allow you to modify your S.P.E.C.I.A.L points later in the game and get the cards you need more easily.

99,Fallout 76,74103785,english,"Did you like Fallout 4, Fallout 3, or New Vegas?  Chances are you're going to like this.

Is it perfect?  No.  It's a Bethesda product, so expect strange glitches.  One example is that sometimes enemies don't react to you, they just stand around completely frozen.  Sometimes you can kill those enemies and can loot them.  Sometimes they can be killed but you can't loot them, sometimes you can shoot them all day and they never die.  I've become stuck a few times, as in completely unable to move due to poor design in certain areas.  I got stuck after sleeping in one spot because the game stood me up in a place I couldn't exit, and in another spot on a boat where I couldn't quite get my feet back on the ground so couldn't jump back out of that space, but there's a fast travel option that can pretty easily extricate you from that kind of situation.  Annoying, but not the end of the world.

Sometimes shots that should hit will miss, or hit something that shouldn't block the shot, but it does, such as an open metal railing.  Again, annoying but not game breaking.

And, of course, being an online game you have to contend with latency on occasion, though generally that's not too bad.  The one time it seemed to persist more than a few seconds was frustrating, but easily fixed by exiting and re-joining, though this is a crap shoot as it may assign you back to the same server.

It plays a lot like Fallout 4.  You can build up a CAMP, and you can build on certain workshops in the game area as well.  The workshops disappear when you log out but the CAMP stays, however it's worth grabbing a workshop or two since some have rarer resources that you can harvest.  Just stop by the workshop periodically to pick up what's been harvested.

There are drop in public events, and the option to create open public teams.  I've completed some fairly tough events solo, but they're definitely easier with a group.  Sometimes far too easy, to be honest.  The level scaling is being addressed, but currently I find that even though I'm level 45 I often face enemies at level 1 to 10.  Oddly sometimes they die in one ""sneak attack"" with my sniper rifle, but sometimes a level 1 will take a hit and keep going when even a level 10-20 will die in one hit.  Armour, perhaps, or a glitch where the level is shown as 1 but it's actually higher than that?  Who knows?

There's a lot of perk variety, every level you gain lets you increase a SPECIAL attribute by one, and pick a new perk.  You can change those at pretty much any time, so if you really want to min/max you can swap out crafting perks for combat perks when you go exploring, then put the crafting perks back in when you're building or repairing gear.  I can't be bothered, but it's an option.  It also means that you can change your build fairly easily at any time, but your SPECIAL attributes are locked in so there is a reason to run a second character if you want to try a drastically different build.

While the game isn't pay to win, it's definitely got some pay for advantage features since you can buy scrap boxes and repair kits for atoms which can be acquired with real cash and they do affect gameplay slightly.  I haven't found repair kits to be necessary, but I'm sure in the later stages of the game being able to repair with a kit instead of wasting some harder to attain resources would be a definite advantage, though not overwhelming.

I don't think the Fallout 1st subscription is worthwhile and it feels a bit like a money grab.  Other than private 8 player servers, some free atoms (in game micro-transaction currency), monthly free cosmetic items, and more stash space for junk I don't really think you get anything that's truly worth the price.  It's basically there for people who really want to support the game, or really want the cosmetic stuff and some atoms to buy more mostly cosmetic stuff from the store, or have a monthly atom allowance to buy repair kits and have a slight advantage over other players.

There's a PvP mode, but in the main game you can basically opt out of PvP altogether (or mostly opt out).  I've only been attacked by a player one time.  It was because the game flagged me with a bounty for apparently doing something illegal or wrong, though I don't recall doing anything to earn a bounty so it was was likely a glitch.  When I had the bounty on my head I got shot down in just a few hits by a really high level player for a bounty of about 20 caps (which is basically nothing, I'm currently sitting just short of 20,000 caps), then went back, collected my dropped junk, and continued on as if nothing happened.  It really wasn't a big deal.

There are a lot of crafting recipes in the game, many that you have to unlock by completing missions and many more that you have to buy or find.  It's fun crafting and upgrading weapons, and there are a lot of options for mods.  Armour can be crafted and modded, too.  Another nice bonus is certain clothing items go over your armour so you can create the look you want without it being covered by armour.  You can cook a surprisingly large variety of things including simple and more complex recipes.  Most recipes, be it for tea, soup, steak, or souffle, will give you some kind of bonus, and heal you at least a little.  Since you need to deal with thirst and hunger, thankfully at reasonable intervals, you need to eat and drink anyway.  You can sometimes heal diseases or addictions with certain meals, gain bonuses to radiation resistance or action point gain, carry weight, and loads of other stats or buffs from food.

I could go on for days about the good and bad, but I'll just mention that the good outweighs the bad.  It's a Fallout game, and despite the bugs it's a lot of fun.

Writing this at my 60 hour mark, at a point where I have given up on completing the game at all.

Wanting at least some sort of closure, I stripped my vault dweller of their clothing with the intent of wandering east until I could no longer do so.  As I neared the edges of the map, I hopped over a short fence and ran into an invisible wall. 

Deterred, we decided to fast travel to a point near a recent nuclear strike.  Still naked and unprotected from the elements, I placed my vault dweller as far into the blast zone as I could.  No amount of Rad-X could protect them from the intense nuclear fallout and they finally succumbed to the radiation.  Thus ended their journey in the wasteland, and mine.

It's a huge risk they're taking, but ... so far (and I didn't play at launch... just bought it on sale in August 2020) it's not bad.

The grinds in the game are not even particularly interesting, with the two major late-game grinds being legendary scripts to exchange for random legendaries in the hope you get your beautiful perfect item (but most of the time resulting in a rather disappointing pistol), and gold bullion. Spend 50 days back to back grinding bullion so you can finish your best power armor set (for one character), and then cry when you realize that if you want anything else thats cool, it will take around 10 days PER ITEM, including any mods such as a jetpack for your power armor set. Because of the lack of NPCS in the initial game, there aren't very many interesting quests to go on, with only the main story quests and a handful of large side quests to entertain you.

... the half assed mmo aspects stitched on with harsh cord..? Yeah. no...

The game has a  lot of issues. The aspect of trying to make it an MMO is just not good. It brings up lots of issues like looting and scavenging, you spend your time running around only to find some guy at level 200+ has already taken EVERYTHING in the place and fuck you for needing to make a brand new gun.

and the crafting as well. Im not opposed to it, i kinda enjoy it, but there is this overemphasis on it. your weapons are leveled, so once you hit 25 you need to make whole new weapons, cause the only stuff your going to find is about level 5, and now worthless. So that legendary shotgun with all the mods made to work JUST how you want it? Get ready to scrap it cause now you have to start all over again building a new gun, all the mods, everything.

Another is the enemies. you can be wandering an area where everything is level 25, when suddenly some random level 62 ghoul appears out of no where and in 2 hits kills you and infects you with so much radiation your about ready to die after you respawn. Now you have to go get all your loot and stuff you dropped, only to find the thing is camping your corpse and your strongest guns barely even phase it before it kills you again. Theonly reason i can get by is i find a stash of over 400 plasma grenades someone dumped in a container by a train station.

Oh, and the currency cap. you can only sell 1400 caps worth of stuff a day to vendors. No actual bartering, just straight cap purchases. cause fuck you.

Now I have only put in a small amount of hours into this game that being 44 hours. And so far my biggest complaint and I am pointing this out in my review as I have not seen anyone else speak of this issue so far personally, is that after completing somewhat of the early story missions, you get to a stage where the level of enemies jumps from about 14-20 straight up to around 60+. There was literally a mission I went to a certain area and fought off a couple of enemies around level 8-10. I thought yeah nice this will be quite balanced and fun as at the time I was about level 10. The mission guided me into a mine of that area and the level difference was ridiculous as I was then met by and most likely the lowest level enemy of this cave.... a diseased level 62 wolf and all the rest of the 60+ level monsters down there (of course I died and could not even come close to competing with these enemies), which I then turned around left the cave and didn't bother with the mission.

My point is the enemy leveling in this game for low level character missions is stupid and completely unbalanced, as the level difference/growth in enemies is massive from only a mission to mission difference and I at level 30, am currently stuck at missions from level 10-15, constantly finding my self not knowing what to do next other than grind levels from events/lower level enemies. You must know that you will have to mindlessly grind these enemies and events and to gain levels the quickest and it will takes ages to level up. There is also no get rich fast scheme in fallout 76. You have no choice but to grind legitimately. I am only level 30 with 44 hours of game time, around 40 hours of me actually playing.

95,Fallout 76,74503978,english,"FO76 - Interlocking systems of boredom

Caveat: I normally complete a game before reviewing it, but that may never happen with FO76. I may not have the whole picture here; but if after several dozen hours of play I still feel meh about the game, I think it's fair to say as much. Factual corrections welcome.

""When I was young, you got 'picking up trash' for juvenile delinquency, from a judge.
 Now you get it for $60, from Bethesda.""

With the previous instalments, Bethesda would supply a bag of screws, and then thanks to those clever modders, you could turn it into the game you actually wanted to play. Wanted just a romp in the whacky setting? Turn up the radio, turn off carry weight and spawn in all the food and ammo you could want. Go!
Liked the base building? Mod the game so you can build anywhere, add new building blocks, and so on.
RPer? Add more hair and clothes, and fix the plot lines that make no sense (goth knows FO4 needed it).
Want a moody, oppressive survival experience? Buy S.T.A.L.K.E.R.!

Obviously, with an MMO, we weren't going to get any of that; the experience is more ""one size fits none"", throwing away the franchise's greatest selling point. There is now one true way of playing it -- whether you like that way or not.

FO76 pushes crafting and base-building on you before you even get the first real quest.
This is perhaps useful as the game seems to stress survival more than previous installments, and a camp that produces some food and clean water won't go amiss. More than anything though it shows you that the happy days of ""play the game you want"" are over.

The game is also somewhat bad at signposting where you should be at any given level, while punishing you for freely exploring (death itself is free, but ammo depletes quickly, and without a camp, so can food, drink, and radiation remedies). It feels like doing anything that is not your current quest is discouraged, as it will cost you resources, without resulting in new ones from rewards. This is exacerbated by the fact that it is not uncommon that trouble finds you, and after a quick look at the number and level of mobs you decide to stay and fight. And then some more mobs of the same type, but 15 levels higher appear. Enemy group composition seems ridiculously random at the best of times even in a private instance. In a public one where mob level seems to depend on the level of the player the mobs were first spawned for ... well, good luck. This of course makes it harder to understand where you should be at your level, as enemy level is not a clear indicator. (Do yourself a favor and google ""Fallout 76 level map"" for at least a general idea.)

Of course, you cannot counter-act a higher-level player's mob spawn by adjusting the difficulty as you could in previous games. In the later areas, you cannot even walk away from a hard fight, level up a bit, and return: as mob levels aren't fixed, the boss that was 15 levels above you when you walked away to buff up will still be 15 levels above you when you return. In fact, his minions will now likely also be of a higher quality, so by training/leveling up, you may just have made the fight harder rather than easier on yourself. Whether you think the game is too easy, too hard, or just right, you will be playing as Bethesda intended, or not at all.

The survival systems never really seem to mesh with wacky world of Fallout. Where such mechanisms could add to the feeling of oppressiveness and self-sufficiency in a game like S.T.A.L.K.E.R. - Call of Pripyat, in Fallout it just feels like interlocking systems of boredom.
It's badly thought out, too: You can collect dirty water (that has rads and possibly disease) that you need for cooking. Boiling it removes the disease, but not the radiation. There is a perk that lets you drink radioactive water without ill effect. There's a perk that even lets you stand in it. But the moment you fill a container with that water, you take rads. You can work around that by wearing a hazmat suit while filling your flask with radioactive water (that your perk then lets you consume safely), but don't tell me that's not ridiculous.
And that wasn't even the punchline yet.
Your base can make purified (no rads nor disease) water early on that you can drink, or craft with. And no matter how much purified water you create, you cannot cook with it, because Bethesda wants you to needlessly hurt yourself with radiated water instead. I don't even.

I think the only way the micromanagement of ""survival"" can work at all is if it's taken seriously, and that won't work in FO76 while the rules are so nonsensical and they're playing up the whackiness of the setting with their Robbie-the-robots who give you a bunch of quests that make no sense, all predicated on the robots ""humorously"" either not realizing there was an apocalypse, or not being able to break their programming. Not to mention headscratchers like, ""Even if history has diverged from our own, how do 100+ years pass before the bombs fall, yet not a single new song was written?""

If you hated base building in FO4, congrats, you're kinda stuck with it now. If you loved it, you'll be disappointed that a lot of FO4 staples (even such basics as ""small stairs"") haven't made a comeback.

Also back are Bethesda Bugs. You can set up what keys to use when playing with mouse and keyboard, but since that works for movement but not for camp building keys, they may interfere with each other, leaving you unable to build. In the end, it's easier to create a layout with autohotkey. (Same issue as with Borderlands 3 and driving, has QA has declined sharply?)

FO4's character creation has also returned, though I found it strangely harder to get decent results this time. That may be on me though; it's impossible to say as there are no ""slider values"" to compare.
It would have been a nice touch had they let us start character creation from the face we used in FO4. Let us save an hour or two out of the door.

The game has also been weirdly laggy for me at times; I can't tell whether it's their net code, or servers, or what. They have also, if you can believe that, made an MMO without text chat. Maybe, it sells emotes? Ridiculous as it sounds, I have at times wondered if the game hadn't been better if Zenimax Online had done it.

The positives

Well, it's more Fallout, that may count. The story's been very basic so far, but in some ways that seems better than waving a badly thought-out story in your face a la Fallout 4.
The world is beautiful (compared to previous titles, anyway). The setting has a faction, the Responders, made up of firefighters and medics that tried to help and train people after the bombs fell. This faction seems beloved by many players in a way that FO4's Minutemen never were. (Maybe it's the lack of Preston telling us a settlement needs our help.)
But here again the lack of text chat strikes. I understand that the early pre-Wastelanders players were very good at making their own fun. It would have been nice to be able to create a Responders-themed player faction that helps out other players, much as the Fuel Rats do in Elite: Dangerous. Another missed opportunity?

99,Fallout 76,74661966,english,"Go in expecting Exploration, not a story-driven experience. (Though the wastelanders update does help somewhat)

If you go in expecting a story-driven game similar to fallout 4, this is not it, however, the wastelanders update can be that thing if you are willing to play the first few hours to reach this story with NPCs. The main drive of fallout 76, is exploration, there are a lot of varied and interesting environments of which you can explore including lavish upper class resorts untouched by the war, a city of robots from an age of automation and typical west-virginian natural landscapes. 

In terms of the story however, a lot of the original story still makes up the majority, mostly told through holotapes, notes and terminals.

Welp... It's really worth a try. You may fall into a pit of love with it...

600 hours in since Wastelanders...

What can I say... 
It's has it's flaws like every single game, but at the same time it manages to grab you and
take you for a really fun ride.
Caviat is... 
Bethesda should not get support for bad practices. 
Poor optimisation. 
Late fixes (If at all).
Greed.
Recent taking away of the amount of atoms you can obtain for free. 
Lack of understanding that they f...ed up big time and they need to change.

All THIS and more... 

But underneath all that corporate greed and bullshit that Todd Howard and 
a gang of his new, rich, non-gamer buddies is throwing at us... there's a diamond of a game, made by many, many passionate people, who are doing their best to steer this manure-show of a PR massacre onto calmer, much cleaner waters. It shows. But then the corporate comes in and f.. it all up again and again.

15,Fallout 76,74603517,english,"If you are a fan of the series Fallout76 (as of the Wastelanders update) can provide a fun, entertaining game as long as you can accept that it is very much a backburner product that Zenimax intended to be a quick Fornite-clone but are only now begrudgingly fleshing out into a fuller game. It also has many of the legacy 'quirks' of Betheseda's creaking & ancient engine. There are cumbersome & annoying elements to the game's design that often interrupt your 'flow' of enjoyment - such as the clunky perk card system & the increasingly dated inventory system. Much of the late game content is unnecessarily time-gated through daily vendor currency caps that can at times completely stop your gaming (full inventory, cash & token exhausted vendors). These reflect the confused wobbling Zenimax/Betheseda have done over whether the game was a battle royale, an MMO or an action-RPG Fallout game.

These caveats aside Fallout76 can be a fun experience with friends or as a single player as the player community is very friendly & the fluidity of public teams & events means you'll often find someone turning up to help if you find yourself in a tight spot. The base building system is clunky but there is an addictive aspect to expanding & refining your own little slice of the wasteland. The storyline can be a little thin, a legacy of the initial decision to not add NPCs beyond robots, but Wastelanders adds enough to push you into exploring the map, uncovering hints of the violent chaos of a pre-war West Virginia pillaged by greedy corporations & the struggles of survivors attempting to rebuild in the ruins.

[It might be a controversial suggestion, but I would recommend subscribing to Fallout 1st once you have filled your stash & for the duration of storyline missions to minimise the headache of inventory management. It can be cancelled once you have completed the storyline & the scrapbox of crafting materials will be full enough by this point to sustain your late game - particularly if you can find a junkpile resource node & build you camp on top of it with an extractor. I'd also recommend buying the collectron robot from Atom store with the free atoms you earn to amplify your scrap hoarding while you have Fallout 1st active]

It is quite obvious the game has improved knowing there were no human NPCs when it first came out. The game today is basically a single player Fallout that just happens to be a MMO which honestly makes it a much better game, but if you are looking for a MMO type game this probably is not it. With that said being multiplayer, and online should be the future of open world games. Its cool that you can build your home, and set up a player shop in a fallout game.

I don't think a year ago knowing there were no human NPCs i would have gave it a positive review, but as of today i have already put more hours into Fallout 76 then i have put into Fallout 4. My biggest complaint is that i wish they would open it up just a little more with MMO type features such as text chat.

I am writing to tell you that you have destroyed my faith in your company. A grand achievement to be sure, as I have been a diehard player of all things Bethesda, for over 20 years. And while you have made many changes to the format of your company, that I find distressing, the one that pushed me over the line is how your customer support is handled. It is by far the most frustrating mess of a process that I have ever encountered (outside of government bureaucratic nonsense.)  Your support staff is hidden behind a maze of FAQ listings that are never, (and I do mean NEVER) about the issues that are killing my game play. When and if you can make it through all the dead ends and false paths leading to more dead ends, then you get to wait (sometimes weeks) for a response, that is always curt, and dismissive, and completely unhelpful. It is abc and forth like this for months. Now I don’t know if this seems right to you, but it damn well seems wrong to me. It should not take months to work out a technical support issue, or account security issue, or any other damn issue that your customer has. It seems to me that your company has taken a firm stance on saying “F*ck our customers!” My most recent experience caused me to lose time and money, completely unnecessarily. Do to an aggressive fishing attack on my bethesda accounts spreading out to all my other accounts, I had to give up my game collection on steam, only to start fresh and purchase the QuakeCon Bundle from steam, All of which have had game breaking crashes, and Neither Steam or Bethesda will do a damn thing about it. Both companies need to step up your customer support game. Make it more direct, do not really on FAQs to do the heavy lifting, they do not. Person to person communication and aid in navigating your convoluted web of forum posts, is 100% necessary. Your companies need to make customer support your focus. Friendly, helpful and AVAILABLE, these are all words your companies need to learn and repeat as a montra. Not to mention that you can create a mass amount of jobs that people can do from home in a time of pandemic. If you don’t you will continue to lose your biggest fans. It seems like a clear choice to me, but I am not a multinational gaming empire that has lost sight of its customer base, so maybe our perspectives are not the same.

It's pretty rare that we've run into something that really ruins the moment. They've worked out most of the game-breaking things I've heard about from launch.

We got the game on sale, for $20, after the Wastelanders quests and human NPCs were added. It feels a lot like Fallout 4 to me, except that we can play co-op and can buy cheap ammo from other players' vending machines.

Answer:  No and definitely not at full price.

  As you can see by the number of hours (over 1000) I put into it thus far, I do enjoy playing it. My time in the game is more nostalgic when the Fallout Series first started, and the first Fallout game came out and blew my mind with a video of a ghoul named Harold. Don't get me wrong FO76 is an entertaining game, but they Reused and recycled way too many resources much from Fallout 4 without even trying to put effort into updating and improving. The content is kind of like they didn't put much of a budget at all into the game and they're just hoping for one last big payday from an engine Bethesda should have retired. 

  Bottom line: if you love The Fallout series then yes I would recommend buying the game (still not at full price), but if you're new to the series I can only suggest you take the money into something that you're more comfortable with.",1597695363,1597695363,FALSE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,26,9,96186,9764,69528,1602056264
77,Fallout 76,74470813,english,"The first game I ever asked steam to remove from my game library after about 70 hours of gametime. No refund, just remove this shit from my steam library. This game has the most bugs, the most useless user interfaces, the most retarded features from all.

- Seriously I can not list the game breaking bugs, they are everywhere, in every part of the game.
- VATS is an ingame intended feature. It is an aimbot, working exactly like that and intended. You press a key and shoot anything, including players even if your crosshair is not on them. You can use it multiple times and it is mostly (99%) the only way to do critical damage.
- Sneak, is when you crouch and enemies, including players can not detect and see you. Even if you are withing 3 meters range in front of them in an empty room at daylight. You also deal 2,5x normal damage in sneak. Damaging an enemy will not break sneak. This is basicly an invisibility that gives you an extreme damage bonus.
- There is no text chat in the game. Yes, this is an MMO and there is no chat. I could not communicate with anyone in two weeks of playing. You can use mic in the game, but the only sound I ever heard was when someone farted in his mic.
- The stash is your box where you can safely keep items. There is only one stash and it is limited to 800. I made it full in one week, I could not even level up character to end game. I did store only important things (materials), and I scrapped them to smallest pieces, still I can not store more. Imagine that in Ark or Conan Exiles you can have only one box and your personal inventory. 
- Quests are childish, they are not made for serious gaming, they are meant to be funny, but they are not. For example: post-apocalyptic world, mutants and robots are hunting for you and for a child in a dark factory full with posions. The quest is to find the little child's teddy bear in the factory to make her happy and follow you back to safety, the whole mission is about a toy hunt. Other: Kill an extremely dangerous mutant while wearing a clown cloths. This is not an achievement! This is a serious mission.
- Overall quality of the game below anything I have ever encountered in the past 30 years. Quality of this product is non existant. The user interface at some places are worse than in the ms-dos era. Seriously, it would be easier to make a dos based user interface than it's current one in some places in the game. The developers are clearly not gamers themselves. I bare to state they have never played with any game in their life. Next to this the leadership of this company who let this pile of sh*t out are totally incompetent, or worse.

As far as I have played Fallout 76, there is more rpg than Fallout 4. I love the Miscellaneous Quest, the Holotape and specially the music. NPC are interesting, the Overseer quest is well done and it gives you a reason to experience the map. I love that the map has so many wonderful sights plus the photo mode made the experience much worth to remember it. It's like experiencing a vacation in Appalachia. The cards system is really good. The multiplayer mechanics seem to be very well done. I'm still in the newbie zone, looking forward to what the game has in other places. 

I'm playing on a Potato PC nevertheless the game works worse than Fallout 4. I'm having lag because of my region. Apart from that I don't find any other problems. People are nice, it's relaxing. 

The only things I personally don't like: ""Too many trees"" I would have to find out why there are so many. Overall the game is worth it.

If you have never played a Fallout, I would say you should start with Fallout 3 if you want to experience world and story. Or if you prefer RPG elements Fallout New Vegas. And if you want a good combat system and very well done city, plus the ability to build your own small empire you should check out Fallout 4.

08/16/20 - After almost 100 hours, I have to say that this game is exceptionally good. They did an amazing job with the multiplayer so the game still a Fallout game and a MMO. Every main quest is fantastic, they did a fantastic job to mix the fallout 76 vanilla and the Wastelanders. The world is huge, there are some many events, side quest, etc 
From the last time I wrote this review, now the game works much better and they fixed the lag.
Does the game have bugs? yes, Does the game have issues? yes. Do you really need the 1 class? no, but you will need to manage your inventory, always.

Personally, I had quite a lot of fun with this as they seem to have fixed the issues that plagued it at launch. I'm not a fan of the slow progression and the gameplay loop of looting everything and scrapping it in survival games bores me, so I'll never buy this type of game for $60 or pay for DLC, but for $20 with all the DLC being free, I can look past the numerous things I dislike about it and just embrace it as being more Fallout. There are a lot of rough spots because the game is made for multiplayer in the events, but the events do not always attract players. 

A better setup would have been to make the exploration tuned for single player and make events occur in entirely separate instances with warps back to our previous locations should we choose to do them. That way they would be special and not an interruption. Also, they probably would have been easier to create and debug.

Finally, I think adding NPCs to the world the way that they did it was a bad idea. Having an empty world (other than bad guys and other real players) was novel.  If the story had paid off that idea with eventually finding **some** survivors who were important and well-acted, that would have been great.",1597583048,1597583048,TRUE,2,0,0.525862038,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,572,96,1656,0,1656,1594508910

6,Fallout 76,74388628,english,"Should've known it'd be just as bad as I'd heard. 

The map on every server is covered in level 68's which I am unable to do damage to for the most part and when they hit me they do 25% of my health in radiation damage which even dying does cure. The melee enemies constantly deal damage to me even when not hitting me and most of the ranged enemies have some terrible aim bot, enemies with a continues weapon like assaultron's laser or the floaters instantly kill you even with power armor and even when they don't even hit you(got killed my an assaultron laser while I was behind it).

The durability system is one of the worst parts of the game it adds nothing fun and all weapons and armor are basically paper. go through one building and you'll break at least one melee weapon and even with maxed out strength you can't carry too many. Armor is a joke it breaks even faster than the weapons and rarely ever drops at low levels(didn't drop for me until I was level 20). They really seem to want to push their repair kits.

The ui is terrible after using an item in the inventory sometimes it'll just decide to move your cursor to a random item so if you just used your last 2 stimpacks and you clicked to use it a third time you possibly just used a rare and valuable item. When you open the social menu to invite someone to a party or to join the server they're on it usually has your selection on the first option which is usually join server or fast travel except randomly it'll put it on another option, so I've accidentally more than one blocked, muted, and kicked my friends from the party because the option that was supposed to be selected was fast travel but was one of those instead. Also when a server shuts down as they often do it has a little alert in the top right corner constantly making an annoying ping pong ball sound and blocking important information. 

When you're building and a piece of ""junk"" has materials you need to build it it doesn't warn you what it is scrapping so I've lost quite a few of my teddy bears, giddyup buttercups, and a ton of other collectible things to the terrible build system. The options for building are terrible to stuff rarely ever wants to snap together as it's supposed to and the options for everything are so limited any good looking building objects are in the atom shop. There's only one type of stairs which only connects to the center of the floor and is a hideous straight metal staircase and building the non-foundation floors require they be connected to it and it often times bugs out and doesn't let you remove the stairs or floors. Trying to place stuff half the time just gives an error ""does not have support"" no matter what and prevents you from building entirely.

I've sunk 26 hours into the game and have to say this wastelander expansion assisted in making the game good. 

This game does have small glithces with the scorcthed missing their head, or certain monsters glithced but this happens in a lot of games. Though it happens more often in laggier servers.

Some time passed, I played and enjoyed Fallout 4, bought F76 on a discount and tried it... and I enjoy it very much.

At the moment, I can't really comment on the end-game. I'm mid20s in levels, I haven't seen majority of the map or explored the majority of the story.
But the game is already worth the purchase.

Adding NPCs definitely changed the feeling of the world and made it more lively.
Bethesda also improved their writing and combined with their environmental-passive story-telling, it's really fun to explore the world. You find notes, some corpses positioned in a certain way, learn the story of people... and get their loot of course.

You can play the game solo completely, or you can play with friends. Both feel fine. You can find the middle way to play solo and join others for events etc - these are handled pretty easily via the UI.

42,Fallout 76,74274821,english,"Positive - There are heaps of quests to keep you entertained for hours on end. It is the Fallout you played and loved with some very major exceptions. Most notably is the MMO game play style. Your skill tree (S.P.E.C.I.A.Ls and new Perk Cards) are an interesting twist on the old system. I particularly like that you can share perks with your friends when grouped up. When you die there is no XP or equipment penalty. You just drop your 'junk'.

Now for the negative - This game is SUPER buggy. My main quest line broke. TWICE. I found a work around the first time and it just kinda fixed itself the second but it took days. I have other quests disappear and had to restart them. I have fallen through the world a few times and died and lost my dropped loot. I have had enemies frozen in place and been unable to kill them (which has meant relogging to complete quests) You will find yourself overweight all the time (an incentive to buy the Fallout 1st VIP I think). It costs you caps to fast travel. And group size is limited to 4 players which always leaves one of my friends the odd man out. You cap at lvl 50 for S.P.E.C.I.A.L points and then you have the option to move a point or choose a perk. Perks are too random before lvl 50. I've often chosen Strength for the carry weight but had to chose a completely useless perk for my build.

Overall- Fallout 76 is great fun. I have spent 70+ hours on it and intend to spend at least another 70. I even bought Fallout 1st and the Scrap Bin is a miracle.

Years later I got a PC and thought it might be better. I load in, create my character, and there is absolutely no sound now. I quit the game and restarted it due to this bug and now my character that I spent an hour on creating is completely gone. Back to square one. I created a fast character real quick to see if the bug was still there and sure enough, it was. ALL this plus terrible optimization. Every step I take frames drop below 60 and skyrocket back up to 75. It feels even worse than when I played on my PS4 (im running i9 9900k/2080ti). I gave in to the positive reviews over the past years and instantly regret it. 

*UPDATE*

When I exited the vault, the sound came back but I was introduced to another nasty, disgusting  bug... NO HUD/UI. My whole screen was blank as if I were playing some graphical game to immerse yourself in. There was NOTHING on my screen. I would walk up to a dead scavenger and you can hear the audio cue like you just looted it yet there was nothing on the screen. Same thing when you would speak with an NPC, no dialogue options or ""press E"" to interact. 

I quit the game to desktop and reloaded. Everything was working as it should. After playing for another 3 hours and getting past all the beginning bugs for about a whole hour of trial and error, I FINALLY started to enjoy this game the way it should be. I'm having a blast now and can say its worth it.... IF you can push past the inevitable bugs. Note, the frame drops seem to only happen when you're in a scripted area such as the vault or the little bar down the road with NPC's in it (I forgot what its called). Other than that fps seem to be okay for now.

52,Fallout 76,74263265,english,"Fallout 76 had a really, really rough start. A vast majority of the gaming community knows this, and most will continue to tell you that to this day. While the game is far from perfect by any means, I think bethesda has propped it up to a fairly decent game that is worth the money when on sale. 

Fallout 76 expands greatly on the stories in the game, and I find myself looking and reading through holotapes / terminals constantly to learn new lore and information. The devs definitely took a pretty serious look at the lore that is told throughout the game, considering NPC's weren't a thing at the start, and I think this really helped them excel in building the story of the world.

The creature types are far more varied than other fallout games, and even when you are 20+ hours into the game, you are likely to run into some sort of monster / beast that you have yet to come across. Not only that, but the variants of each beast is a very welcome feature (e.g almost anything can become ""scorched""). 

The combat mechanics are there, VATS feels very clunky to me but honestly I have found myself just not worrying about using it. It does get annoying at points, because I definitely had a habit of mashing the VATS button in older fallout games, but I am slowly getting more and more used to it. The current VAT function in game isn't horrible, and it works - its just hard to get used to. 

The playerbase is absolutely AMAZING! When I first started, I had a multitide of people come up to me and offer help, ask how I am enjoying the game, and even gave me items to start out. This seems to be a pretty common theme throughout the game, and its a pretty nice breath of fresh air compared to other games like it. 

Overall, I think this game has really good qualities that especially ring nicely with previous fallout fans. I will mention that while I recommend this game, I think it should be bought at a discount rather than full price. It is a very fun game, but it does not come without problems. 

The atom store is still very leechy feeling. The way microtransactions are handles in the game aren't the most idealistic way I'd like, and it sucks that some things (especially a lot of base building options) appear to be locked behind the atom shop. 

If you are looking for a true, mmo-like game, this ultimately won't be it. You would be better off checking out games like ESO for that.

Controls are slightly different than fallout 4, but not by much. Just take the time to get used to how it is set up and it becomes pretty intuitive. VATS is more of an aimbot in this game, does not slow down time, only gives you a percentage chance to hit the enemy in general, no limb targeting.

71,Fallout 76,74217208,english,"Being a massive fan of fallout 3, 4, NV, I had to write my one and only true personal verdict for this game. 

There are tons of new and existing feature to love about FO76. 

Mainly the survival aspect of the game. If you have a played on harder difficulties in previous fallouts, there is a food and water meter to maintain. FO76 forces this system on the players. To be a fan of survival games such as Green Hell, I loved it when I constantly have to check my food and water meter to ensure I am getting my Max AP regen.

Crafting has been involved slightly. Where looting anything and everything I see is slightly more rewarding as I turn weapons, armour and junks into craftable material. One of my favourites has to be disassembling weapons to unlock more mods option for that specific weapon. 

Perks are currently RNG which is not a feature i absolutely favour. However, this forces me to try out various new playstyles I otherwise would not have taken in previous Fallouts. ""Yes, I was always choosing the sniper, locking picking and hacking perks."" Forcing me to select perks that reduces junk's weight by 25% or reducing water radiation intake by 30% makes my journey in FO76 less treacherous. 

While there are other features to explore and talk about, one notable feature worth mentioning would have to be the non game breaking glitches that happens in game. If you consider yourself a FO fan, you would know FO is FAMOUS for their weird and funny glitches.. One of the glitch I faced was an enemy was shooting at me as her body was submerged in the soil with only her head popping out. It made me LOL as it reminded me on my similar journeys I had playing FO3.

----- Buy it when it's on sale -----

+ It doesn't have separate launchers and updates will download through the steam platform.
+ Updates are not heavy and annoying like other MMO titles.
+ You need Atoms to purchase skins and special blueprints, but you can earn atoms for free by playing the game.
+ New ""Legendary Run"" add season reward and it's free, you don't need to buy a golden pass or anything.
+ It has a battle royal mode in Beta.
+ it's MMO/PVP but it will never gonna have toxic players because game mechanics don't let this happen. So you can choose to not precipitate in PVP.
+ So much to learn and too many places to explore.

- The game needs some optimization
- Some known bugs need to get fixed (visually annoying)
- Stash has limited capacity, so if you like to collect weapons and stuff you will soon hit the limit. ( no Bank or upgrade to stash yet)
- No Karma Mechanic yet, because NPC recently added to the game and you can take everything in front of them and they don't care.
- You can not Pickpocket, or put live grenade inside enemy pocket so sneak is not fun as it was in other Fallout titles.

83,Fallout 76,74198310,english,"I initially was given Fallout 76 on PS4 by a friend to try upon release due to his own commitments. Upon release this game was a horrible husk of what a multiplayer Fallout game should have been. They decided to go with no human interaction besides fellow players or recordings. among many other aspects that made this game woeful.

After a year and a half I had a morbid curiosity about the game and wanted to check it out, so I asked that same friend if I could borrow it. After putting 2 hours into the game on PS4 again I was massively surprised at home much the game has changed to add a more personal and engaging experience. I bought it on sale at £17.49 and after 9 hours I can say that the game is a lot of fun, particularly with friends. IT now feels like a proper multiplayer Fallout experience with add extras that make an overall nice product. Human NPCs, old school conversation windows, some hilarious dialog along with a natural progression system makes for a very entertaining game. There is more content roadmapped for the rest of this year and hopefully no plans to abandon it soon.

I just want to say hats off to Bethesda for turning this around, the game is by no means perfect and I just hope they have learned from some of the really poor, earlier decisions they made.

Combat feels very clunky and although the ""miniature world"" depth of field effect is charming and interesting at first, you soon come to realize that that's it, and there's not much more to it. The game feels very quaint, calm, pleasant, and nice, which isn't at all what I'm looking for with a Fallout title. The soundtrack and characters feel static and unbelievable, and when one gets curious enough to strip the game down in the internal settings, you're left looking at strange graphical choices by the developers, including the implementation of something called Enlighten, which is the game's way of providing reflection and wetness to textures. Enlighten unfortunately triangulates with several other settings which were present in Fallout 4, and all in this case are required to be set to on unless you're comfortable seeing pure white bodies of water or bright basic bold colors on all textures. If you have an older machine with which you could coax Fallout 4 into a beautiful and immersive game, there is unfortunately no way here to do the same. The textures are also scaled internally in a very strange way, and are almost impossible to make truly sharp without severe decline in performance. Once the available layers of these settings are stripped off, you're left seeing how rudimentary and hollow the game is, and although I'm willing to give Bethesda the benefit of the doubt with how an online-only title might change things with its engine, I'm still startled that this even made it to release. AI is worse than Fallout 4, which was worst than previous titles. Every enemy is a completely mindless blockhead with no perceptible reason to exist in the world other than to wait around until something shows up in front of it.

9,Fallout 76,74154920,english,"First, let me point out that while I recommend this game, I do so based on my experience.

Fallout 76 is basically like playing Fallout 4 in multiplayer. It has many fun moments, but also some moments that feels wrong/bad. Due to certain parts of the game rendering system, I recommend anyone with a low-average PC to stay clear out of this one as even at the lowest settings, some stuff remains active and this will makes you experience a nightmare. In my case, my PC is beefed up so it's relatively great!

The game is, at most, a 7 out of 10. It has many tiny issues and also some bad choices in terms of designs/concept. I did face some really strange bugs and some even required me to ALT+F4 out of the game. (A lot of the bug comes from the UI being toggled off due to some boolean value not returning as it should.) I have also experienced some issues with the DoF (which is turned off) where it will be active while you open the menu and might not restore completely (making things from 50m-60m away super blurred.

Other than those kind of bugs, I haven't experienced anything major (yet?) so this is why I'm more on the ""yes"" than ""no"" whenever it comes to recommending this game. I also bought it on sale, which helps me appreciate it maybe more than those who paid full price for it.

Upon launch on steam, I had to troubleshoot for hours on how to get it to run properly. When I finally got it working and started playing I ran into a myriad of issues in-game such as frequent crashes, server disconnects, and severe in-game bugs. When contacting customer support I was either just completely ignored, or sent a link to a help page with generic troubleshooting steps such as restarting my wifi and making sure my P.C was updated.

Honestly, the new wastelander’s quest wasn’t that good. It didn’t have the most critical aspects of a fallout quest: consequences, meaningful choices, and memorable characters. Yes, you got to choose which side you got to complete the quest with, the settlers or raiders, and in the end, you got to choose whether you kept the loot or shared it with the settlers, raiders, or both. Your choice would affect your reputation with both factions. But this choice was an illusion, in the end, the most logical choice was to keep the loot for yourself and take the hit to your reputation with the factions as you could always regain reputation through the meaningless and repetitive daily quests. Your choices had no overall real consequences

Other than the quests the game has you take part in repetitive daily quests and events, all for the purpose of getting special armor or weapons. The game lets you complete these dailys only once a day to keep you logging in to continuously grind away the same missions so one day you could get some new loot which is pretty overrated anyway. Other than the questlines the game is pretty much the same as the iconic “Another settlement needs your help” From Fallout 4 on steroids.

There are still tons of bug which make the game overall frustrating and unplayable and bug patches or updates that fix these bugs only come every few weeks and even these only fix a minuscule amount of bugs leaving tons remaining.

So i will give you my opinion about it. When 76 just came out I didn't get it because of the reviews and the terrible and I mean terrible launch. But when i bought it last week it really changed the way I viewed the game. The game was so immersive and being online made this even more impressive, switching to the radio station brought back so many memories from when I used to play fallout on my consoles. If you're reading this and you're afraid that you won't like this game because of the player base and the quality of the game then don't be afraid. Everyone is super friendly and sometimes they will give you meds when you're at a low level. So don't be afraid that this game is online, but one of the issues that this game suffers from for being online is the servers crashing. Even thought I only have 32 hours at the time of this review my server has crashed multiple times and you have to restart your mission its extremely annoying especially during one of the server events. And for new players SCRAP EVERYTHING you will need every component especially gears. The game is very grindy once you reach level 20 you can continue the story line and factions will open up to you, so this game becomes much better past level 20. 76 is fun, its really fun if you're okay with losing your progress sometimes and grinding every now and then you will love this game like I do.",1597080372,1597080372,TRUE,0,0,0.476190478,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,40,4,2199,0,1945,1597275427

56,Fallout 76,69922990,english,"Revised during the Legendary Run.

What I like:
1. SCORE / season progress feels natural and enjoyable in the scheme of how I like to play.
2. No annoying chat box- voice and emoticons only
3. Small player counts on servers
4. Great Stability on my system - have not been kicked from servers or hard crashed
5. Familiar Fallout style quests and NPCs
6. Lots of gathering / exploring / farming 
7. Variety of gear and PERK builds (there may be some Meta builds, but Im not sure yet still)
8. Crafting system is great with SPECIAL
9. Character building / sense of progression
10. Very Friendly and Helpful Community of Veterans
11. Lack of PvP (a negative for some)

Negatives:

1.  There are bugs - mostly minor things, as I have not experienced any hard crashes. There is occasional server latency issues on my end, and the most annoying bug I'm faced with is a weapon issue that's been posted about. 

2.  Load screen times. I am not playing on an SSD, it might help. They range between near instant to 10 seconds.

3. Frame drops and lag spikes due to the above issue can occasionally be poorly timed with combat. 

4. CAMP item limits. I get that they want to reduce the area of the build, but you're also limited by the number of items that can be spawned / stored at the CAMP

5. Community Event around Resource Dumping for BOS was poorly planned and may lead to a huge morale killer for the interest and participation of its duration. On the contrary, I think it's the community's way of saying, ""Try Harder, Bethesda!"" because it's bad.

61,Fallout 76,74066275,english,"I really wish there was a option between thumbs up and thumbs down.  I enjoy the game but it has alot of serious flaws that i'd expect of a novice game designer but not from a seasoned AAA title producing company.

As always bethesda is amazing at world building and creating worlds that truly feel lived in.  I joined after wastelanders content patch so i never played it without the NPCs.  

Where it really falls flat is their end game loop designed to keep players roped in and spending money until the next content drop.  It really shows that they have never done this sort of thing before and didn't think to hire outside consultants from more successful companies to help with their pacing.

The UI and lack of thorough keybindings is terrible.  In the past they have relied heavily on their modding community to fix this sort of thing.  There are alot of times where the selection cursor jumps around the UI as you are quickly trying to do things with items causing you to do things like sell items you wanted to keep (which you can only buy back at like 5 times the price you sold them for).  The worst times, it can actually sell items from completely different parts of the inventory you don't have open.  This is only one UI bug of many.

Eh this is gonna turn into a laundry list of complaints. Despite all of that i still feel it's worth picking up next time it is on deep sale, like i did.

63,Fallout 76,73708826,english,"I bought this game as a huge fan of the fallout series and its arguably one of its least engaging chapters.  There are one or two interesting quests, but the majority of the time is spent reading terminals and listening to holotapes.  Wastelanders is indistinguishable from the tantrum a petulent child would throw after being told to share a toy or eat their peas, with most of the content nothing more than chains of endless fetch-quests designed to wear down players as punishment for the hubris of even suggesting Bethesdas original game was somehow lacking.  XP generation is gruelingly slow as its tied to the pace of quarterly earnings at Bethesda in the hopes that hundreds of hours of unskippable exposure to the atomic shop will somehow incense you to buy an overpriced asset from Fallout 4.  sadly it seems to work.

When you're not grinding daily quests repetitively youll have about 5 in game currency systems to manage, none of which produce remotely meaningful earnings and largely exist to plug the void where engaging storytelling once lived before the finance department sent everyone but the art team packing.  Daily quests are also punctuated by a tense uncertainty as the timer slowly crawls to zero, waiting for other players to join in and help.  Dwindling player numbers compound this anxiety and a system of seemingly random server upgrades tied to no known SLA or schedule can place you on 30 minutes notice at any given time that your quest will be made to fail by default.

Performance is what you may expect of a game touted with distant weather systems, four times the map size and sixteen times the detail of failout 4.  It crawls on a Radeon RX 470 with screen tearing and stuttering still commonplace.  Sometimes enemies dont load and dont take damage, and often times a glitched quest at a specific server can have you hopping servers for half an hour to find one that isnt full of half-rendered enemies, broken AI, and invisible walls of missing texture.

updating this after an additional 29 hours of gameplay.

66,Fallout 76,74059566,english,"I’m not going to be the judge whether you should buy this game or not. To each their own, buy it and see for yourself.
All the negativity about the game, the terrible lag, the poor support et cetera, it’s all out there already, and as far as I can tell; most of it is true, but you’ll learn to get by. A lot of negativity, sure, but it’s a stunning game, even in my mandatory lowest-settings-even-though-I-have- a-computer-that-runs-newer-games-than-this-flawlessly, it has a great atmosphere, just like all the previous Fallout games did. I’m a big fan of the Fallout franchise.
Just like in Fallout 4, I can add to the beauty and post-apocalyptic chaos as well, by building stuff. Because 76 is a multiplayer game though, the building options have been limited and you can tell there’s been an attempt at making it idiot-proof. Doesn’t matter; I’ve been making a living as an idiot in the creative industry all my life and I enjoy the challenge.
But this really isn’t a game for people who want to do more than just slaying all the monsters that come at them. It’s not a game for people like me who want to have fun and do and build silly stuff and share it with the community. As far as I can tell, this is purely a game for people that are addicted to micromanagement. And for the same reason, it’s a game that drives people like me insane.  

I don’t mind a challenge every now and then, having to go out and chop wood, kill some creatures or solve a riddle to get where I want to go, but in Fallout 76 it’s  ridiculous; you have to micromanage EVERYTHING, ALL THE TIME, AND THEN SOME.  And it’s seriously spoiling the ‘game’ part of this game for me. Everything feels like w***, and the daily grind I was trying to escape. I don’t mind doing chores, but Fallout 76 just keeps stacking them and stacking them, making Cinderella’s stepmother looking like an amateur.  

For example, here’s what I did during today’s eight hour session, (I’m leaving out the having to reconnect several times because of server errors and lag bits) and an introduction. (You can skip this part If you don’t want to read endless epistles, or you can skip this anyhow. I’m not your mum)

For a while I’ve had this idea to build a camp that has two pitchfork shops. One is a big corporation type of hi-tech spotless building that sells ridiculously expensive 1499 caps pitchforks that come with a life style and status quo, the other is a small dirty old shed of a grumpy guy that sells the same pitchforks for 10 caps. Why? Because I think that’s funny and it’s what happens in real life. (Don’t worry, I’ll keep selling all plans I have at 10 caps each somewhere in the back of the build, no matter what. Which reminds me: if all you guys are so against pay-to-win, DLC and such, why the fuck do most of you try to sell stuff at ridiculously high prices? Give what you have to the community already).

Anyway. To achieve this plan, I’ve been saving up caps all week, looting, pillaging and scavenging all over the world to buy the Signs and Letters plan, which is 9500 at the regular vendors. I need that because it’s essential to show the difference -and similarity- between the shops, the expensive one needs to have its name up in lights. 
I’ve already bought all the shiny floors and wallpapers I want from the shop, so this should be the day I could start building and I’m psyched. I’ll be needing lots of steel for the build, so the plan is to claim the Grafton mining workshop first thing. 
But I start my day dehydrated and hungry, so I have to cook and boil food to get through the day. Well, not the day, the next half hour, really. The amount of food and drink the game thinks I need seems to be adjusted to the average intake of the US, (which is the setting of the game, so fair enough. But a bit overdone for us Europeans). But hey, no worries; I have some carrots and tato’s growing at my camp, I’ll be good once I figure out how much dirty water I’ll need to cook as many boiling water to make as many vegetable soups as I can. Easy. 
Bent over to the stove I notice I can only do a few because I’m out of salt. Salt! So I’ll have to head to a place where I know they have lots of salt first. Map, fast travel, here I g… I’m over encumbered. Now I have to get into my inventory and stash to see where I can lose weight. I have all the perks for carrying and some legendary stuff that reduces weight, but somehow there has never been a day that I’ve not been over encumbered.  
I may be a hoarder.  

Or I may not be a hoarder and just not be able to tell where the weight in my inventory actually is. After getting rid of all the ooh-that’s-nice-maybe-I’ll-keep-it items, I’ve only lost 2 pounds and I need to lose at least 50 more. Let’s dump all the drugs at the vendor! Oh wait, can’t. The vendor’s out of money. So let’s just dump all the buffout and stimpaks anyway, maybe some poor soul will find them and be happy. Still over encumbered. I’ll try and stash the Power Armor suit, which I probably won’t be needing anyway; that’s another ten. Oh shit. The stash is full. Of what exactly I’ll never know, I’ve been keeping it tidy, wrapping everything up in plastic, tossing out everything that is not essential. (Which makes this game cruel, really. Because you want to keep silly unessential stuff like frogs and tin foil hats.)   
Okay. Simmer down. I’m playing a game, this is fun. I’m going to concentrate and see where I can lose weight and what I can sell or toss from the stash. I’m going to be right organized here, just watch me. I’ll just go in there and figure it out.  
Hm. Things are not in order, which makes it difficult to see what I have and where the problem lies. When I was in the army a long time ago, I always thought their reversed naming of things was silly, but now I learn that ‘helmet, metal, green paint’ is a lot better than ‘green painted metal helmet’.  
I can sort by weight in the inventories, cool. But it’s sorted by weight of each single element. I may have ten tonnes of feathers and it won’t show up.  
I’m getting fed up. I’ll just get rid of some ammo, some of that may weigh quite a bit. I have one of those ammo-exchange thingies, so here goes. Okay, let’s write down which weapons I use at the time and which ammo they use, so I know which I don’t need. Ammo is very light in this game, but it might add up. Ten minutes later, having gone back and forth in the menu of the console about 600 times, I end up about a pound lighter. Okay, so ammo is indeed very light when you drop all missiles, fusion cores and nukes immediately after you find them.
Now what? Did I dump all my junk? Yes I did.
But wait. I remember there’s also junk that mysteriously gets categorized as miscellaneous, and junk that doesn’t get scrapped for whatever reason when you click scrap ALL junk. So there we have all the ores and the other stuff. Heavy! So let’s melt the ores! Oh shit. I need acid to do that, I’m all out. Am I going to do that first, or the salt, or… what else was there? I had something in mind. Oh yeah the steel at Grafton mining.   
I’m really getting fed up.   
I’m just going to toss the power armor altogether and get rid of those amazing –but heavy- legendary guns so I can fast travel there. I’ll probably have to walk back if get I get a good haul anyway, and I’ll worry about food and drink once I get there.
Long story a tiny bit shorter: I got to the Grafton workshop, got my steel, died a couple of times, made enough money to buy the plan I wanted and did.

That concludes my example of the grueling micro managing that no one should have to do in real life, and certainly not in a game, ffs.

But that’s all to plan, probably.  I imagine a manager with a son playing Minecraft telling the game designers to ‘make it harder’ and every single one of the ideas they came up with got implemented and everyone got a bonus.

Or all of them, managers and designers, just didn’t have a clue what they were doing. Higher up on the probability scale.

Allow me to direct you to my review of this game.  Warning though, I checked i don't recommend this game, unless you're a hard core Fallout fan, or if you like to endlessly grind for stuff you have no control over what you'll be receiving.  But if you just want to try it- wait for another sale, or actually just find it free somehow, dont buy it.  I cant in good faith anymore recommend this game for purchase. If you are hell-bent on playing it you're gonna buy it regardless of what i say.

Bethesda has taken player complaints and monetized those complaints in the form of Fallout 1st.  I realize that my review was pro Fallout 76. But in it i warn of Fallout 1st, and now that the S.C.O.R.E. in game system came out, it has taken away players ability to earn the in game currency.  

The building element to this game is nice, unfortunately the best aesthetics are locked behind a pay wall in the atomic shop. 

So I am going to link my review of the game, and a video i recently made; which was a few months after my review that explains the new in game battle pass style system.  Any questions feel free to ask me or leave in the comments.  Thanks

11,Fallout 76,73989160,english,"I had this game on the xbox gamepass, and have put 98 hours into it. I only bought it on steam because the gamepass is incompetent and makes 1.6gb updates into 45gb because they corrupt your files.

The game is not amazing. It could maybe be called good, if its a good day. The devs have stopped paying attention to it and release useless patches that cause controversy after controversy, like the most recent one where they added the newest event that was supposed to be added the patch before - except they didn't enable it and told us to wait another two weeks for it. 

The game is also exceedingly grindy. Everything is a grind, you have the battlepass grind, the legendary weapon scrip grind, the federal reserve grind, the faction rep grind, the bottle caps grind, the level grind, and the standard resource grind. The Faction grind, at peak efficiency, will take you 18 days - and to unlock all the fed reserve stuff will take around 51 weeks of logging in every single day and completing the dailys and events to turn in your measly 20 reserve notes for 200 gold. 

The game is also retardedly buggy. I hard crash to desktop pretty frequently and there's a lot of stutter in the game. That isn't even going into the myriad of minor bugs like bosses not spawning because they get stuck in the ceiling forcing you to redo the dungeon again while you have even less supplies or enemies just not spawning in correctly. 

The quests in this game are mostly terrible. It is pay 40 caps to fast travel across the map, kill a single robot, fast travel back across the map for 40 caps, get paid a little xp and like 60 caps, netting you a net loss of 20 caps and wasting your time. Basically all the quests are like this, the only quest line I actually enjoyed was the Enclave's, because it has the only good character in the game - Modus the self aware Enclave AI. A very well written and voiced character, honestly if the game had more like him it would be so much better.

Also, you basically have to pay the $13 a month subscription for the unlimited stash unless you like doing inventory management for 20min after you loot one dungeon while you try to scrounge for plastic to make bulk shit.

So after all of that, why the hell do I keep playing the game? Its fun. Is the game good? No, not really. But the gameplay loop of doing events and scrounging for junk is fun, especially when you do it with friends. I basically had no expectations for this game, and the pretty bad dev cycle hasn't really increased those hopes. However, what is here you can easily sink a few hundred hours into. I'm hopeful that the two coming events is going to make the game more fun and add more content, Wastlanders is a grindfest, but it was a good update. Sadly, it seems like the game has been given up on by bethesda, and this lack of morale seems to have seeped into the community, even into the people who stuck with it during all the PR mishaps early on.

That being said, the community is probably the friendliest I've ever run into, even if only 1 in 20 people actually use their microphone. If you need something, if you just ask for it, there's a pretty good chance someone will just give it to you. Its a real shame, this game genuinely has a lot of potential, and I hope it gets realized. If this game is on sale and you want a fallout themed MMO then get it, if not, $40 isn't too bad but I'd probably wait for a sale or a big content drop to buy it.",1596912764,1596930803,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,327,76,3329,0,115,1597847176

+ Great Fallout experience both solo and with friends. Quests and NPCs are great.
+ Great music
+ Base building is fun
+ Scenery is amazing
+ Runs smooth. Which brings me to cons below:
- Sometimes weird drops in fps occur (perhaps connectivity issue, not optimization)
- Minor bugs, but nothing that caused me to close the game in anger

45,Fallout 76,73939229,english,"Now that this game is on sale, I'm quite certain alot of you are considering to buy this game. Having not played other entries of the Fallout series, besides New Vegas, here are my thoughts of the game in general.

For newcomers to the franchise, Fallout 76 has a slight learning curve, the pacing is great, and the game itself will be a good challenge, assuming you don't grind first.
There is no text chat, sadly. Most people don't talk much either, we use emotes. You'll be seeing lots of waving, hearts, thumbs up and thumbs down emotes. So this is a fresh experience.

Pros:
1. Decent story.
2. Currently on sale.
3. Lots and lots of customization.
4. All sorts of weapons and modifications.
5. The community is helpful and friendly as a whole.
6. Very large map that you won't have to worry about PvP.
7. Very gear based game, luckily the market is not that off balance.

Cons:
1. A*sholes will one shot Legendaries.
2. The game might crash, sometimes.
3. Quite a handful of exploits and dupes.
4. Glitches that makes you wanna bang your head.
5. The game gives you subtle nudges to buy from their atomic shop. All hail micro-transactions.

Overall, it's a very fun experience, I've played for 161 hours so far and I'm still considered low level. Heck, I even feel like I just started playing. Could easily see myself playing >1000 hours.

Note to other new players:
Don't be in a rush to complete the story.
If you feel lost, you're playing the game right.
Try not to google ""best builds"" or ""best weapons"" until you're at least level 50.
Don't sell your gear with the star icon at the end of their name to vendors, exchange them for scrips at train stations.

Since then I've discovered Steam and played many other games, some of which I enjoyed, but nothing...NOTHING touches the richness of experience that Fallout provides.

I claim a workshop, start to build, but then when I'm off, someone else can claim it from me?  I spent until level 10 gathering supplies and then built lots of work benches, all I'd need, at my first workshop site, but when I logged back in, it all was gone.  Not much incentive to build, which is a bit of a pity for me because I LOVED the building aspect of FO4.  But, I'm still trying to get the hang of it all and I just love being in the world.  Oh, I hate the scorchers and I do wish I wouldn't get ganged up on by mutants or scorchers or anything else when I can't even be at a level where I can use power armor.

I came here and decided, you know what? Despite all the controversy I'll give this game a go.

I wanted to like it and while it was a little fun at first, that ran out quickly.

The game itself becomes a grind fest, and it is so much worse if since didn't get a Fallout 1st Subscription.

And the bugs... EVERY time I log into this game, something will break. As minor as workshop icons not displaying correctly on the map, annoying as an enemy suddenly back to full health(Non-Legendary), Maybe your mic won't work today, or the last straw for me, when SCORE  challenges auto-complete and not granting you SCORE so it's gone forever. Of course I sent a ticket to Bethesda and their response? That they know of this bug (Which STILL has not been fixed!) and that ""Due to tool limitation we can't grant/edit SCORE"".

Is this really the game they had in mind?? This has been done 999 times before, what even was the point, even if you had a non buggy product? It still would've been this cookie-cutter, endless MMO grind thing.

The perk cards aren't even that interesting and the weapons are very obviously dampened because everything is so glitch sensitive.

Second review - Educated Opinion.
This game is moderate. I tend to go it alone now, I've branched off from my crew. I thoroughly enjoy hanging out at my camp with the boys, and getting absurdly high and walking for hours around the map with nothing but a Minigun and full power armour. These journeys are really good and I'd recommend them to anyone. The ambient music entraps you and keeps you focused on the journey and not the games lag filled damage systems and horrible servers. It also gives you the initiative to keep playing even though the game thoroughly lacks all forms of content excluding cosmetics; but even there it is lacking some.

Honest opinion. The game is about a 5/10. It is not worth anything over around 30-40 dollars. It offers comfortably I'd wager around 70 hours of game-play before it becomes a grind.

First Review - Initial Thoughts.
$15 - $25 dollar value here.

Here's what you can expect starting off, you grab some of your friends and start to quest together. You quickly realise the NPC's and Co-Op mechanics are poorly implemented. You turn on your radio in hopes of at least hearing some tunes and to your dismay, the game still has a bug that has been known and existed since release which just nukes your audio so you cant hear jack while playing. I really tried to like this game, I gave it a second chance from the Stress Test / Beta. And even with all this time, and all the updates / the Wastelander expansion its still about a 3.7/10

The developer appears to tacitly endorse griefing, due to their refusal to disable punji boards which are often abused for griefing in so-called ""trap camps"". Typically it's a chair smushed into a walled area - if you sit in the char, usually to access a ""secret shop"", it will push you through the wall into a punji board deathtrap.

It's worse than that however. It's one thing to be a dumb noob, it's another thing to walk away from a trap camp and suddenly have a cage of punji boards spring up on you without walking on a trap trigger.

Bethesda must know about this but for some bizarre reason they refuse to do the right thing and disable punji boards. Their refusal to follow common sense and do the right thing amounts to a tacit endorsement of griefing - hence the ""Not Recommended"" rating. Buyer beware.

It is possible to spend a lot of time to just collect junk and build up and advance your camp (house), so you don't have to fight all the time. And it is easy to pack your camp and unpack it in another location.
I was afraid of constant attacks on the camp but so far, I haven't seen anyone anytime really attacking my camp. Only some random ghouls wandering sometimes.

+ Rewarding Seasons
+ Public teams
+ Conversation history
+ Multiple ways to fast travel
+ You don't loss pretty much anything if you got killed, have possibility to restore your junk
+ Some free items in Atomic Shop, changing time to time
+ Ally in my C.A.M.P.
+ If you took part of an event but moved away before the end, you still get rewards
+ Battle royal mode Nuclear Winter

I've only been playing a couple months, so I can't comment on or compare the state of release to the current state of the game. But if what I've read is true, I'm definitely glad I held off. The game was plagued with bugs (still is), glitches (still is), terrible optimization (still bad*) and lack of content (Wastelanders has helped with this) and with the ratings tanking, I honestly thought the game was gonna be left on life support. 

Turns out, Bethesda either truly cares about this game (though I doubt this) OR it was a huge money-maker for them (which I'm sure is the more logical reason). They've put in a lot of work, added a lot of new, though similar, content and I found myself pretty engaged in the game. Though I'm not crazy about their latest addition of ""Seasons/Battle Pass"" (for the sole fact that, although I play a fair amount, I don't think I'll be able to reach the end of the battle pass), it's new and free content, so I can't complain.

Do I recommend? It's more of a 60/40. I think the game has a ton of potential, and bringing the game to Steam helped quite a bit with population. And along with the addition of Public Teams (think: party finder), I've yet to have any issues finding groups to complete events. BUT AGAIN, the game still comes with a myriad of bugs and glitches and even with a decently powerful PC, the game runs like trash without a ton of .ini tweaks* (which takes like 10 min, but still, fix your game Bethesda), so if flaws like this in other games turns you off, this probably isn't for you.

As a new player, there will be a decent amount of content to get through and I have hope that Bethesda will continue to add more content. If you hated the direction the Fallout IP went with 3/NV/4, if you have a PC under the requirements, can't stand games where the devs seem to almost go out of their way to ADD bugs, or if you dislike having to grind for gear and currency, RUN AWAY.

You cant level up your weapons and armor and have to hope in the constant RNG that you get lucky and get something with as good bonus wise on the legendaries items that drop.

16,Fallout 76,72073009,english,"Too much of a buggy and slow frustrating mess to play right now. Can't currently recommend. Had 6 people in a server today and still could barely play the game. New content is nice, but I'm sick of major gameplay issues being ignored.

Update: I just keep playing like the idiot I am and getting what I deserve. More and more game-breaking bugs, and they just keep piling them on. It's funny because I initially played this game during it's first free weekend. I thought it was alright, but didn't feel it was worth the $60 at the time. Keep in mind I had very few issues back then. Mainly just a few performance issues. When I came back for the 2nd free weekend I found the game a lot more enjoyable with the Wastelanders stuff. A lot of people felt this content should have been in the game since release. I feel the same way.

Regardless, I with the $30 price tag I felt it might finally be worth a purchase. I hadn't really encountered many large issues up to that point. I played a total of about 40 hours between the two free weekends(obviously my hours from the Bethesda launcher won't be recorded here) with no issues making me hesitate a $30 purchase. Since I purchased the game from Steam the problems just keep stacking. Rubberbanding has gotten worse. Stuff you do in the game sometimes takes a full minute to even register. I can't tell you how many shotgun shells I've wasted just for the all the shells to register at once, or for some of them to not register at all. I also encountered my first CTD about 80 hours in...Among the countless annoying issues is a certain death bug that has really made me consider uninstalling this for good. There is nothing worse than being in a Scorchbeast Queen event to 1) die to an enemy that was glitching into the ground and unhittable and B) dying and glitching out to the point of being softlocked. All that ammo wasted on the queen and I got nothing for it. I had to force close the god damn game and lost all of my junk too of course.

I really like the game. I mean I want to like it. The biggest god damn mistake of this game is that it is an online game. Almost every issue I have is some sort of server-client issue caused by the fact that it is multiplayer. It's funny because they could have made a decent game if it wasn't multiplayer. The devs decided to venture into the MMO genre and it doesn't seem like they had the experience to deal with the massive online issues, which is very unfortunate.

If you would have asked me a couple months ago I would have recommended the game to you most likely, at least if it was on sale. It's too late for me though, I already lost my $30, although to be fair I got a lot of gameplay out of it. Whether or not I stop playing isn't going to make a difference to the devs, but I luckily avoided subscribing or buying atoms thank god. All I can say for anyone reading is to avoid a purchase. Hopefully I can save you some of your hard earned money. These devs are not going to actually improve the game until their wallets take a hit. Even all the stuff they apparently have planned is receiving very poor reception from PTS play testers. The current status of this game is not great, and the future doesn't look too bright for it. Hold out as long as you can on a purchase if you really want to play it.

Update: New update causing random crashes. I have managed to play over 100 hours with very few crashes. Just getting more frustrating to play as time goes by unfortunately.",1593932803,1596601685,FALSE,1,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,228,21,12587,1153,3761,1602006211

Is it enjoyable? Actually, yes, now that Wastelanders has been added. 76 really needed some NPCs for your character to play off against, and the faction quests are fun to do, although the ending of those faction quests (at least with the Settlers) is a bit unsatisfying. The setting is beautiful (After playing far too much Fallout 4, it was nice to see vegetation again.), and I didn't feel like there was a massive difficulty spike that stalled my progress at any time. Character creation took a bit of getting used to, but I do feel like I have more control over my character's stats and abilities than I did in 4. The CAMP...well, it's only okay. Not great, but the blueprint feature is a nice addition.

It also has the nasty habit of telling you you have to buy it to continue playing, even though you've already bought it.  Currently can't get it to launch for this reason.  

The game and quests are pretty good when working, but the junk collecting, scrapping, and crafting mechanic is awful.  The game is unplayable without collecting things and scrapping them for materials, but you may only store up to 800 weight (unless you shell out for an additional monthly subscription on top of the $80 you already spent on the game).  This means about 1/3 of your in-game time is spent monotonously scrapping, bulking, and attempting to sell excess materials.  Very frustrating.

98,Fallout 76,73775247,english,"I would say the game takes some warming up before it gets....good?. Don't get me wrong, from the beginning the visuals and music are top notch, the atmosphere and overall vibe of the game is right where it needs to be. Social interactions with both players and Npcs are...strange. Player characters come in two forms, 
1- Those who are attention seeking twits (because they cant actually do anything to you AHAHA) who just follow you around wasting ammo. 
2 - SUPER generous people who will pop down a brown paper bag full of stimpacks and other goodies. So if a level x4billetc ever gives you some chems, pay it forward and help the next lowbie you see when you reach a higher rank.

3 tips for a new player.
 1) You'll want to get to level 20 as fast as you can...it's a real grind, but at 20 is when the faction and main story-line take off. Also, collect and scrap EVERYTHING. Scrapping can be done at any crafting station. Pack your chest with all the base components you can, because having a stock pile to pull from when you need some ammo/armor/guns etc will lessen your need on caps. Also read all recipes and plans at lower levels, otherwise you cant craft.
2) Hold off on spending your perk points for about 6 or 7 levels. First get a feel for the game and the play style that you think fits you best. There are Meta builds out there, don't worry though, they're quite diverse and fit varying classifications without being too cookie-cutter. I would also advise to maximize on how you naturally play, not perk into how you ""want"" to play...it'll save you hours of frustration and piles of stim-packs. An example, if you find yourself having more fun, and kicking ass with a hammer or sword, then perk into strength and endurance. If you enjoy building armor and guns that never break, hacking, or being an apex chem user, then Intelligence and Luck are your branches. If you wanna be a snipey back-stabby ninja, then Luck, Agility, and Perception are your primary branches.
3) DO NOT go into 76 expecting a fallout 3 or 4 play style. 76's character and npc interactions play off some of the older titles in the series, and do not cater to the same in-depth dialogue that you find in 3 and 4. Though human NPC's have been added to the game, some areas still feel barren and empty. One has to remember though, 76 takes place just shortly after nuclear winter has faded out, most of the human numbers that make up the settlements and cities of later games are still locked away in their vaults. Foundation and Crater though add a bit of a social spark to the game's solo experience when you just want to sit back and vibe in-game. 

Base-Feelings about the game? I was originally thinking about getting a refund, THOUGH I gave it the benefit of the doubt and played on....over the last two weeks the game has kind of grown on me, a feeling that seems quite common with players.

Going to kill creatures and realizing their health bar isn't moving, at all. My weapon being stuck in V.A.T.S, I could go on. There's things that need to be fixed that I doubt will be fixed. Aside from that, I have met some really incredible people from the game. People I consider to be really close friends now, I do occasionally run into some bad apples but the community is really nice and makes the game so much better.

46,Fallout 76,72866988,english,"Fallout 76 is a first person/third person MMORPG by Bethesda. It's an attempt to create a multiplayer Fallout in a Fallout 4 engine. It is set few years after the nuclear bomb drop.

At release, Fallout 76 didn't do so well because it has so many bugs, and one big thing that really important... the absence of Human NPCs, making Fallout 76 world, the Appalachia an empty and boring wasteland. It has been updated with few patches and content updates ever since, with the big one being the Wastelander update that brings the one thing people really want... the Human NPCs.

[b][u]GAMEPLAY[/u][/b]
In terms of gameplay, Fallout 76 is pretty similar with Fallout 4, so if you like Fallout 4, you'll like Fallout 76. Many features has been changed or improved in Fallout 76, such as survival is now part of the main gameplay instead of difficulty, workbench now has multiple function, it can craft, modify and scrap weapons and armor, it can also scrap junk. Ammo can also be crafted here with the new Tinker's Workbench.
But the one features that receive significant changes is settlement building. You can still claim settlement and build it like in Fallout 4, but they are not persistent. Once you log out, everything you have build will reset along with the server. You can however build your own C.A.M.P. It's quite similar with settlement building except you can set it up anywhere far away from named locations. It has small build area but enough to build house and some farm. Anything you build in camp is persistent and you can take them server to server.
Player level and perks also changed. You still receive a perks points everytime you level up until you're level 50, that's basically the limit although technically you can level up indefinitely. After level 50, you stop receiving perks point and everytime you level up you'll get a chance for re-spec your build instead. Perks also works differently in the form of Perks Card. Most of the perks is similar with Fallout 4, while some are changed to balanced things out.
Being an online MMO, the End Game of Fallout 76 is no really satisfying. The most common things to do is get a nuclear code, assault a missile silo facility, launch a nuke, go to the blast zone, if the blast zone is the fissure site, fight the Scorched Beast Queen and get legendary stuff, if the blast zone is not the fissure site, farm end game materials for crafting end game stuff. Repeat.

[b][u]NUCLEAR WINTER[/u][/b]
Nuclear Winter is another game mode for Fallout 76, a battle royale mode with Fallout twist. Currently there are 2 maps, well it's basically from the Fallout 76 Appalachia maps but shrinked for battle royale mode. The maps are Morgantown and Flatwoods. It's a decent game mode if you like PvP, gameplay works different there. You also gain an Overseer Rank, which gives you some rewards everytime you level up. I don't play this mode that much since I don't really like PvP.

[b][u]GRAPHICS AND PERFORMANCE[/u][/b]
Graphically, Fallout 76 is quite similar with Fallout 4, with some updates with the lightning effects and the worldspace now has better color palettes. The rest is pretty similar to Fallout 4. I don't know about the 16 times the details but it looks quite the same to me.
Performance however, is a mixed up bag. Sometimes it runs smoothly no problem, other times it's stutter and feels really not optimized. Remember Boston in Fallout 4? Something like that. I run medium settings and the stutters still there a bit. There's also many moments that I called it ""Really Bethesda?"" moment, such as clipping stuff in the wilderness, strange ground textures... just ruin a little immersion.

[b][u]FALLOUT 1st[/u][/b]
Like other Bethesda MMO games, like TESO, there is a subscription membership for Fallout 76, called Fallout 1st. The current benefit of the subscription is:
1. 1650 Atoms each month. It's kinda a good deal because it's cheaper if combined with the other benefit.
2. Private Server. I tried it for a while and there are some difference with the public server. Performance is somewhat better in most cases. Server will last 20 minutes after you log out from the server so until then everything will stay there, your workshop and stuff.
3. Free NCR Ranger Outfit and Helmet. Pretty nice if you ask me, but since this is a one time benefit I think I prefer a free stuff each month.
4. Scrapbox for storing Scraps, you can store unlimited amount of scraps there. This is a game changer stuff because unlimited scraps is valuable.
5. Survival Tent you can place anywhere in addition your standard C.A.M.P. This is another game changer because you don't have to spend caps anymore to place your C.A.M.P. Instead place a small tent that already has a bed, cooking place, Stash Box and Scrapbox so you can store your loot anywhere, anytime without a hush.
6. I think I get another set of Outfit and Helmet but forgot the name.

[b][u]CONCLUSION[/u][/b]
Right now, after the wastelander update, I feel like Fallout 76 is... well kinda good. Feels like an expansion for Fallout 4, it looks similar and familiar with so many new things to discover and bigger world... I like it. The Human NPCs are there, camp building is nice, the event is okay-ish, the quest is fine... yeah Fallout 76 could use more updates and content but right now is good. I recommend Fallout 76.

47,Fallout 76,73587021,english,"What a complete, total and utter disgrace. So i decided to give this game another chance after a $100 tricentenial (every single thing in the tricentenial package was a complete waste, added nothing to the game and you got some skins that were so dumb and ugly no one in their right mind would ever equip them.) pre-order on xbox one. I didnt care that it was online and strayed from traditional fallout. (Even though thats literally the stupidest idea ive ever heard anyone have in my life.) People did hound bethesda left and right on every fallout 4 post ""make it multiplayer der der der im an idiot"" they said. I remember sitting there thinking these must either be young kids playing too much fortnite (which is the most pure crap game in existence) or incredibly inbred/pseudo mentally handicapped people, or i dunno fallout 4 was the first fallout they had ever played and were also dumb as a bag of d*cks stapled to Malin Akerman, and now somehow were the prevelant voice/commentors listened to by bethesda.

Honestly i was excited to share fallout with my friends upon seeing the ads for 76, I thought maybe they thought of a way to make it not terrible and i was wrong. No effort in anyway imaginable was put into even attempting to make this a like a 4 player drop in with some fun to be had. I frequently commented how stupid anyone saying to make fallout 4 multiplayer was, which they were in fact stupid AF, seeing how it turned out. (Bottom line is that was an extremely dumb idea and this game does NOT offer you any opportunity to enjoy a fallout game with friends.) Listening to fans is good an all, but this is what happens when you listen to children and complete morons.

I pre-ordered it because Bethesda had a rep for making at least decent games. It was so bad that within a couple months the 3-4 friends i had convinced to buy it and we all played daily, had all quit due to the sheer frustration of how broken this game was. I literally lost face with respected personal friends because they thought i was a complete moron for saying ""nah fallout games are sweet you gotta buy this."" (they were more multiplayer Call of Duty players and had never played a fallout title between the lot of em) Ive bought and played EVERY SINGLE FALLOUT TITLE. Ive bought and played every elder scrolls since daggerfall. This is just a joke, not even a joke it's an actual real life MAJOR CRIME involving false advertisement, theft in the hundreds of thousands if not millions and shady business tactics. (but then again thats exactly what robert altman is known for, ill get into that later)

I didnt even get to play the game this time, with bethesda.net login errors upon attempting to launch and i will be refunding. (the first refund on my steam account ever, and ive had it since the very day steam even became a thing that existed.) Two years later and the first thing i run into is errors that keep me from even playin 1 second. Bye bye second chance. This whole mess has been nothing short of criminal and a latent attempt to STEAL from all the fans that became loyal to bethesda before Robert Altman, ceo of Zenimax which owns bethesda, took control by stabbing the friend that brought him into the company in the back. 

Robert Altman is a complete scum, is cancer to the gaming industry and has been indicted for federal level criminal charges relating to super shady business dealings. As soon as he took charge (shortly before the creation of Fallout 4) greedy money hungry tactics started. They started ""updating"" fallout 4 and skyrim on an almost biweekly basis, with what werent updates, just small bits of code that were designed to break every mod presently existing for the game. They fixed nothing and offered nothing. They couldnt even bother adding the fixes the unofficial patches fixed, they just set out to break these mods by any means possible. They just want to make money from it all being creation club content now. 

I love how in the press they say ""when you try new things, things might go wrong"" a multiplayer game isnt a new thing. a mmo isnt a new thing. A fallout game isnt a new thing. Yet they try an play it off like their shady a$$ business practices, since Altman took control, were anything but a large company/ultra rich people violating american laws and ripping people off on purpose. Every single thing they say is a lie and a garbage excuse for the fact that they decided to release a game that needed at least another year of work. They decided to put out big budget commercials implying the game was ready (false advertising), not that it would be ready nearly 2 years from now. No where in any of those commercials did i see any mention of ""this is an experiment with a $60-100 price tag.""

You dont get props or applause for ALMOST getting a game up to snuff almost two years after you sold it to people for finished game price. Just what a joke. The higher ups at bethesda and zenimax should be fired, replaced, or they should quit or commit ritualistic suicide any of those are fine with me. They know, in their hearts, they are complete scumbags. They know what they've done here was wrong and borderline criminal. From the whole shady promotions with the canvas bags to their crap $300 bottle of rum. You can just see some scumbag dude who belongs in jail is now running things at bethesda. They dont care, they get mega rich off ripping people off and no one is even going to attempt to hold them accountable for their actions. 

As a household, we will never buy another bethesda product again no matter what games we miss or what they put out. My teen son is no longer allowed to purchase bethesda products. They have ruined all faith and i give about a 90% chance that even if a memory of bethesda, before Robert Altman took control, causes me to buy another game from them, it will be a $hit scummy EA level low quality high priced thing i wished id never bought. 

People helped ruin this game too, all you scumbags who got nothin better to do but cheat and dupe in every dam game you play, yall helped ruin this game by being $hitty people and at least half the blame falls squarely at your feet. Whole reddit communities based around selling duplicated 1 in a million chance armor and weapons. All of you who participated in that should be ashamed of yourselves. (now wiping every character and all inventory is the only way to even hope to save this game because of you D-bags) All you people upvoting this absolute $hit game are to blame too. How dare you recommend this broken shameless cash grab to people. Ya'll create the EA's, the microsofts, and now the bethesda's by having no objective thought and advising people to buy $hitty terrible games that dont deserve an ounce of respect from anyone period. 

Again, to reiterate, as long as Robert Altman (look him up, he is a for real scumbag) is in control of zenimax this is just the beginning of how scummy bethesda will become. I have no idea how ANYONE can sit there and say this is acceptable with a thumbs up. Thank god for Steam not being scumbags like bethesda or microsoft and allowing me a fair and right refund. Now i can spend this money on The Outer Worlds, which had nothing to do with Altman's scumbag a$$, so it should be created with a slight sense of basic human decency.

The game overall is pretty good after all stupid patches and bethesda lies

The game probably great after all, i really recommended this one
Combat is not like predecessor fallout 4, vats now reword (no more slow motion and you need perk card to target specific body part)
Gameplay is probably not best after all, sometimes bug come out (i call it features sometimes somehow its funny to watch stupidity AI)
Communication yea remember no text chat only  voice chat is probably good decision since i already sick spam and scam in text chat
World, yea its beautiful west virginia baby,nothing wrong with it just not as cool as normal one
Control, sometimes broken sometimes work but not make me upset after all
Story, take a note, this is not story telling game sometimes its disappointed but first at all, i dont care about story as long as gameplay good for me, i m good

[h1]NO proper respec system[/h1]
 After level 50 you can't raise your specials and the only way to reallocate points into another tree is to continuously level up moving ONE point at a time and you can't pick a new perk card if you move a special. They need to make it so you can reset specials and de-rank perk cards when you want to so you don't have 150 cards in every tree

[h1]Late game build diversity[/h1]
The explosive legendary effect should've never been brought back from fallout 4 it was OP and its even worse in fo76. When 70% of the community uses the same bloodied explosive gatling builds there's a problem. 

[h1]Paid weightless junk[/h1]
This is just a cheap gacha game mechanic. You can't make your game based around junk that builds and repairs items and then give people a limited storage only to sell them back a monthly membership that removes junk weight. SO scummy.

92,Fallout 76,73545555,english,"I wanted to like this game, I have played most Bethesda games.  I know it had a bad start, but I heard they made progress. So I jumped in.... it was sort of fun exploring the world, and even a bit of the building.  There are a few neat quests, and there is potential here but the broken pvp, lack of any end game context except another boring end game grind leaves you feeling wanting. I got through the vast majority of the quests, and cannot say I did not have some fun.

Pros, They did add new creatures, food/water is actually needed somewhat,  the areas do feel very different, there are a few big set pieces, and it can be challenging at times. It is fun to build up your first camp and play with the mechanics  of that.

Biggest turn offs... they pretend it playable standalone, but it really is not. With out the monthly subscription it is almost unplayable. You have almost no storage space, and cannot build almost anything.  I paid for two months just to have time to look around and check everything out, but really it was like most of Bethesda... to little spread too thin.  The game is very buggy, the player have had to be creative to find work around the broken build system that does not let you place things half the time, the game likes to crash semi often, and any workshops you have captured or quests you are in the middle of lose all progress.  I stuck it out for a while, but I can see it is going no where and have better things to do with my time.

With all the bad press, I should have known better, tried it on a free weekend... liked it enough to commit for a while... but was more of a waste of money and time then anything else.

I guess it my own fault, I forget how limited their games are with out moding, and I only really liked most of their games when I have a chance to fix all the broken things.

Feel free to check it out if you want to check out new world space, it does have its charm but keep your expectations modest...bring a healthy amount of patience for when you want to rage quit at the broken game.",1596170680,1596170680,FALSE,1,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,199,1,13899,0,13899,1596169441

7/10

Update:
Having now put in a lot more time in the game I can reiterate this suggestion. The game has actually turned out to be a really good sandbox, especially if you like the CAMP building.
The game still lacks a concise endgame, but the gameplay loops are still rewarding.

I highly suggest this game to any fans of the series or a lighthearted take at the looter- shooter genre.

8,Fallout 76,73525506,english,"The Fallout franchise has been a staple in my gaming collection since 2009.  I spent my entire Iraq deployment playing Fallout 3 and got hooked instantly.  My one request for the game was to have coop added.  When the announcement for 76 debuted I almost screamed like a little schoolgirl.  I instantly pre-ordered the collector’s edition for Xbox since most of my friends have not joined the PCMR yet.  But of course, I picked it up on PC also.  After spending what seemed like weeks of playing it between Xbox and pc I have come to a conclusion of the game.

[h1] Multiplayer [/b]

The game definitely has its flaws, that is apparent.  The multiplayer aspect just needs one change.  Do not charge for a private world.  Everything else with Fallout 1st, I understand doing microtransactions.  The worst part of the game is if you cannot afford Fallout 1st, the game forces you into a public world where you will most likely get annoyed or harassed by other players.  

[h1] Content [/b]

The content of the game is outstanding.  It does need some tweaks but overall, they really captured the classic Fallout experience that I was looking for.  My one main improvement would be to improve the rate at which you can craft weapons and armor.  It felt like I was almost outgunned and wearing paper armor the first quarter of the game.  

[h1] Conclusion [/b]

I would highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys the fallout experience that has been missing bringing a friend along on the adventure.  I would not recommend this game to anyone looking to hunt other players.  The game was not designed for that and if you are looking for something along those lines then I would stay away as you will be disappointed.  I buy a lot of games for my friends so we can play coop together.  However, this will not be one of them as one of us would have to pay for Fallout 1st.

14,Fallout 76,70709182,english,"I love the Fallout series of games.  However, Fallout 76 just doesn't live up to the previous games.  The new requirements to continuously replenish hunger and thirst are tedious, and the stash limit of 800 pounds (which was previously 400 pounds!) is far too low.  The world is vast, yet sparse.  The early game enemies are weak, yet dole out quite a bit of damage.  I will power through this game, but, so far (at level 23), I can't say I'm having fun.  On the plus side, the C.A.M.P. concept is sound, and the crafting is well balanced.

== Addendum ==

Fallout 76 takes a long time to get used to.  At first it seems unbalanced, but the more you play it, the more you see that the balance is actually fairly reasonable.  You have to make choices about which advantages to have, and the fact that the S.P.E.C.I.A.L. system is limited assures that everybody's choices are a little different.  After you hit level 50, the next time you level up, you can choose to Move a Point between SPECIAL classes, or pick a new perk.  This is actually very useful, in case the character you've become at level 50 is not quite the character you wanted to become.  I'm now level 100, and though I've finished the main quests, I still have side quests to finish, including ally quests.  There are also 1 or 2 allies I have yet to find.  Once those are done, you can still play the game for the purpose of joining events, gaining XP, and collecting more perk cards.  Additionally, there is now the Legendary Run, which is a separate leveling system that grants awards for completing tasks.  For this reason, I expect to continue playing Fallout 76 for at least another month.  Therefore, I have revised my recommendation to ""Yes, I recommend this game"" (especially if you get it on sale for $20).",1592029594,1596084937,TRUE,1,0,0.523809552,1,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,71,3,25734,1847,2623,1602054173

This games needs to be on servers in which accounts are tied to.  Go in one time, find nice players and good camps to visit.  Log in next time and it is the the total opposite.  Logging in each time is just a crap shoot of players and camps.

No text chat.  Makes it difficult for any new player to ask for assistance, advice or how something works.  Guess Bethseda was assuming all players are highly familiar with their Fallout series.

33,Fallout 76,73438986,english,"Without a doubt, it's a genuinely good game at the moment. It was met with a horrible launch. Buggy, broken, and boned to the core. Though, throughout its time it's been getting updates. The Nuclear Winter update, Wastelanders, Wild Appalachia, all of these. And it's got a bright future ahead of it. Each update has brought new Appalachians and brought old ones back. I'm a big fan of the Nuclear Winter mode, so I may be biased towards what I think of it. The Nuclear Winter mode was amazing in how it was done. It managed to keep a Fallout tone while being the 2nd fortnite. It's gunplay, mechanics, and just how aware you have to be made this my favorite BR. I'd go as far to say it would be one of the best. It's gameplay is good at best. Could definitely use more end game content, instead of it just being completing dailies, getting the 258th water cooled bonesaw for Ward and convincing the 923rd runaway Crater cuck to come back or go to foundation, and kicking ghoul and super mutant ass in Westek and Charleston. When you're brand new, like, level 1-75 maybe? Content seems endless. Then you do every single quest and it's all gone. They're still making new and better quests, especially after Wastelanders. I'd say its worth the money, and you should definitely give it a try if you love fallout.

51,Fallout 76,69872735,english,"See additional comments after the first paragraph.

Came to Fallout late with Fallout 3 and 4.  Sceptical about playing but decided to pull the trigger with the new DLC.  So far pretty meh even with NPC's added back to the mix. Biggest issues with this, not keen on them putting repairing armor and weapons back into the mix, loved Fallout 4 for not having that feature. Not big on being forced to do even more crafting beyond upgrading weapons and armor on top of not being able to use certain weapons and armor without first hitting certain levels.  With other Fallout you could progress to better weapons and armor fairly fast.  You complete lower level quests without rising far enough on levels at the end of them to do the next grade of quest lines. For example, by the time you have hit Signal Strength and need to go to the radio array you still have not reached a level to take on the 30+ level enemies in the Savage Divide. Your run out of space easily and don't have the faithful Dogmeat companion to hoist extra stuff for you.  Finally the perk system blows, yes it's more flexible but seriously lacking in laying out a road map of skills like the perk chart did in Fallout 4 so you knew where you wanted to go as you leveled up. Finally the lamest thing of all is the Bobblehead and magazine perks being temporary buffs unless you come across what you need to re-enable the clock on them.
All in all the combination of above act to make playing more tedious. The game map is huge even bigger than Fallout 4 and it's DLC's put together. Exploring all the map and playing all the quest can eventually be tedious in and of themselves so you don't need more tedium built in.

Ok so just hit level 65 and got access to MODUS after finishing the Wastelanders DLC and things have improved after a 10 level jump from a 2x XP week.  Take back the comments about the perk system now that I understand how to navigate it, it's very powerful. Still clunky if you need to switch somehting out on your basic build you wnat to use for a minute than go back. Need an easier way to swap out cards. But Holy @#$% now that I have crafted 50 level Chinese Stealth armor and got a hold o 50 level Fixer and put the perk cards in place for all 3 Rifleman filled, Tank killer filled and the the sneak and covert filled. It took a while to grow on me but I;m running solo with reasonable ease.

Three  things still need approvment. The system that controls enemy level by player level on the world needs considerable tweaking. Since I'm not putting money into anything else right now I went ahead and got a private world, big difference. Charleston Cap Bldg said 60+ on Private world 30+. So typically your fighting enemies at twice their level on any standard world.  They could add some more things to the Private world like again Dogmeat as a companion with his own story arc for solo play only with a limited carry weight of 20-25.  Also fix the Tadpole quest so you can earn the large backpack without reviving another player.

58,Fallout 76,73369377,english,"The good:

This game has a lot promise and certain things are still fun like building your camp or finally getting to run in some cool power armor. There are a lot of mods and cosmetic things you can do your armor, weapons, power armor, and your character. It's also pretty cool to be able to alter your face whenever you want. The combat is also fairly fun with a ton of different styles of play to fight enemies. You can be stealthy, loud, or however else you prefer to engage enemies. 

Here are my issues with this game:

There are not enough enemies in some areas and in some there's way too much of them. You can clear an entire place and then five minutes later a horde of enemies will respawn and murder you.. completely negating any effort you just put into game. Your items degrade very quickly. Your ammo runs out even faster because most enemies are bullet sponges. The scarcity of items like ammo and even food and water becomes very apparent the longer you play. Sometimes you're left without food or water.. ammo running short and you can't fast travel because one rad roach is near you or you're over encumbered because you're just trying to fix your broken stuff. Sometimes you're just dehydrated but the game won't let you fast travel because dehydration is considered health damage when it only caps your AP.. preventing you from going anywhere fast if you're hungry or thirsty. Most the time you're left to gather resources and supplies to get everything in your inventory nice and repaired.. only to have one horde or one event knock you back down to when you first logged in. Enemies have a very very long following distance before they are not longer aggressive to the player. I've run far beyond the areas that enemies have spawned at and still end being destroyed because they wouldn't leave me alone. In addition to all that the areas you play in feel.. empty. Gone are the NPCs you'd see in previous Fallout games. The ones they added in the Wastelanders update are lifeless and only repeat a handful of phrases. A lot of Settlers end up just insulting you when you cross paths with them. They always talk about ""fixing up the place"" but never actually fix anything. There are no more grand quests or NPCs that make you feel good about them being around. You can have some NPCs join you in your camp but they'll never ever shut up. Remember Lydia or Preston Garvey? Remember how much they talked and how annoying that was? The followers that come to your camp will never stop talking. There's one that plays the guitar non-stop. She only stops to say something sappy and overly optimistic before she's back to the same song. ""Gramps"" is another follower that only says things like: ""Books! We should have built more libraries! That's where we went wrong!"" It's best to just make them go away or you'll never have a quiet moment at camp again. Another word about the lack of NPCs is that you're left with previous recordings of people on holotapes that you know are long dead.. so why even bother listening to them? It begs the narrative question of ""why should I care?"" It doesn't make you want to do quests. In this game the Brotherhood of Steel are all dead within the in-game map and the Responders (the faction native to this game) are also all dead. You can hear them on recordings when they ask for help defending places or powering up some power plants but that's the only way you can interact with them. If you can even call that ""interaction."" Would it have been so hard to model a few BoS guys and put them in their base? Would it have been so difficult to include a few living Responders to do patrols and such throughout the wasteland? There's so much that they COULD have done but just didn't. I'm happy I bought this game during the summer sale because I don't feel that it's worth a $60 price tag or any price tag above $35. I really hope Bethesda sits down and really makes this game worth playing because it could be a super fun game. Just look at the Elder Scrolls Online: it's got some flaws but it feels miles ahead of whatever Todd Howard and his friends at Bethesda managed to cobble together.

Fairly good Fallout experience in my opinion.
I never did try before Wastelanders but overall enjoyed the game so far, especially after reading and seeing YouTube videos on this game when it launched.

Positives:
+ The perk system is really fun, intuitive and packed with stuff that impacts your playstyle;
+ C.A.M.P. stuff seems pretty in-depth , i've wandered into some amazing player created spaces;
+ The Wastelanders storyline has a few player choices to make and some fun NPCs to meet;
+ I'm a sucker for RPGs so the amount of gear, outfits and customization you can deck your character in is fairly large;
+ The radio is packed with great tunes to get yourself immersed in the game; 
+ The world is fairly large and with much better variety of scenery than previous Fallout titles;

Negatives:
- Game performance in some areas is really choppy;
- Didn't enjoy the repair kits in the Atomic Shop, the in game repairs feel like they are a bit costly to entice you to get these;
- Fallout 1st felt required for the scrapbox to me, i can't imagine dealing with the inventory without it;
- Enemy scaling is weird but this is apparently getting fixed in the next big update;

If you are on the fence about it because of how the game launched know that its in much better shape now and i haven't run into any major bugs aside from some performance issues and the janky enemy model spazzing out here and there.

69,Fallout 76,73332509,english,"I am not a adept reviewer so I will try and sum up my thoughts overall as to why I recommend this game in 2020 and moving forward:

1. Game is pretty to look at in most instances, I run on a potato and I generally can enjoy the sights this game has to offer while running on mid to low settings.
2. Like some new implementations such as weapon and armor degradation, weapon plans, and discovery through scrapping, makes me feel like I am legitimately trying to scrounge and search for new resources in order to develop a weapon that I have spent time with to it's peak.
3. Fallout with Friends, something I didn't know I would enjoy until now.
4. Open world building for myself and types that want to pick up their base and go.
5. Additional progression systems which entice me to grind out quest and mobs to achieve unique rewards.

Now there is some bad, this game is far from perfect and its reputation is still a stain on Bethesda's record:
1. Many Bugs - The amount I experienced varied, and at times are jarring for how unpolished the game can be. 
2. Limited Storage - It's frustrating enough that you are capped at a certain weight capacity for the entire game unless you choose to sell your items or opt for a paid service that removes the cap entirely.
3. C.A.M.P building - Can be cumbersome at times and seems more restricted in areas that it wasn't in the previous installment. 

All in all this review doesn't account for all the good and bad this game has to offer, I was not a early adopter at launch and have waited this entire time to play it with the release of ""Wastlanders"" I have heard of many problems plaguing this game which has kept me at bay, but now that I have picked it up my overall feeling towards the game is positive for now, I still have a lot of the story to go through and my expectations were low from the start.

I'm a major Fallout3 / FO:NV and especially Fallout4 fan , I've lost count to how many hours i've spent playing Fallout 4 Modded.
I have avoided buying Fallout 76 since its release due to a very rocky release and total lack of NPC's etc.  I felt it was a simple lazy cash crab.... which quiet frankly was true.
However fast forward to ""Wastelanders DLC"" this has made a world of difference, the world now feels populated.   This doesn't mean it's a great game but it is at least a good game and will certainly scratch that Fallout itch.
I bought this game at £18 which really is a bargain for the hours its given me now.   Even if you just play through the new DLC content or do a little of the older vanilla content it is worth the money.  
There is the usual online game grind for rep etc if you want to keep playing after you finished story etc.

This game is not without its problems too, this is after all a Bethesda game and there are bugs and random crashes. After a year a lot has been fixed but there is still far too many bugs for a game that has been out for this long.
The game engine is just plain old now and has been so bandaged up that you will get massive FPS drops at totally random places but this is nothing new to Fallout players.   However what is new is the insane lag at times, rubber banding all over the place and DC's are not uncommon.

7. There is malt liquor in the game
8. If you drink malt liquor while playing the game it becomes more tolerable
9. Sometimes if you fight enemies and youre losing they will sometimes abruptly stop moving and stand ramrod stiff. Or they will just disappear. 
10. If you enjoy a very unrewarding system of constantly collecting garbage to make one of the numbers attached to your equipment go up. You might enjoy this.

23,Fallout 76,69413058,english,"DISCLAIMER: Fallout 76 is a great game that I enjoy thoroughly, and will continue to play it; if you are a fan of Fallout 4, the Wastelanders update has made this a completely new experience, and a /must play/. However, it is marred by greed and bad practices that should have every player take a step into it with a grain of salt. If you are apprehensive about throwing money at Bethesda at this time, do not do it. I do not recommend it unless you are able to look past the Atom Store completely unlike me.

Wastelanders update has breathed new life into Fallout 76, and has made it a more fleshed out and satisfying experience compared to its catastrophic initial release. I enjoy it thoroughly, and would recommend it to anyone that likes Fallout 4, but I cannot recommend it wholly due to the sick business practices still being pushed by Bethesda to this day.

The Atom Store is the first culprit: if someone is going to pay 17 dollars a month, or 107 dollars for a years' worth of Fallout 1st, they should get everything in the store for free. Giving them an allowance isn't adequate when they are pumping that much money into the game. They basically get an allowance of 1800 Atoms a month and a tent. The tent is nearly necessary, because FO76 is a big grind. This is also marred by the fact that guns and armor in the game degrade so quickly, that the resources we have to repair them with are always dwindling, even for the players whose levels have passed 100; repair kits of all things can be bought in the atom store with real hard earned money, and you need a lot of them. The allowance is clearly there for the players to throw at random things that should be in the game already. and the repair kits are what people have to spend more on. If i spend real money on a weapon that I will probably scrap in a couple of days due to progress, I want that thing to be permanently unbreakable.

The game is still as buggy as ever. Player economy is non existent right now due to vendors being shut off due to a large bug.

I wish I could say Bethesda did a 180 with this update, but they did a 90.

UPDATE: I now have a few hundred more hours in the game, and there are so many bugs, its ridiculous. This engine is not good for this kind of thing. Vending is back and in full swing, but the amount of exploits, hacked weapons, and crashes too, are mind boggling.

I would have gotten a refund, but I tried waiting on a response from Bethesda support first.
They made a ""incomplete"" account, with the most F...ed up name. When I registrered an account through Bethesda.net, they could not remove the link between this ""incomplete"" account and my Steam. So I'm stuck having the worst name ever in a cool game. So I refuse to play this game, or even recommend it to anyone, until Bethesda gets their support up and working. I got several replies on my email from Bethesda support, but suddenly they closed the case and deemed it ""fixed"". I have later made several attempts to contact again, without ANY response.
And guess what.... It's still linked with the wrong account.

Updated review from 10. June 2020:
They fixed it, after much back and forth. It now works, and I can finally play with a decent name and a safe email.

Revised review after 34 more hours ingame (24. July 2020):
It's an enjoyable game indeed. It was worth the wait for the fix earlier. There are so many places to explore and quests to do! I'm still just a noob after my 34 hour journey into the wasteland. It takes quite some time to be a hardcore collector of useless things (That I will scrap anyways).

34,Fallout 76,72398973,english,"Like some people, I have a love/hate relationship with this game. I love this game because of how many missions there are, that will keep you playing for 100s of hours. But, I do find annoying is that some missions can take a few hours to complete, even side quests! I was never into Fallout 4, but this game took me by surprise with how much there is to do, and how big the game really is. I have not gotten into the Wastlanders update though, but from what I have heard it is a very good update. And with Bethesda realising their roadmap for the upcoming months, there is sure a reason to keep coming back and playing this game. I have encountered a lot of bugs though. But not all the bugs are bad though. When building your CAMP, you can do certian glitches that make your base look so much cleaner and better. While some of the bugs can be frustrating at time, like freezing and cant move (not due to my pc, its the game), or some of the enemies being invincible, although they cant move or attack you which is good at least. And the floaters in this game also freeze and stay up in the air after you kill them (they are supposed to explode, but they are really annoying sometimes). There are also some side quests from a year or two ago that Bethesda dont update and fix. So they can be bugged sometimes too. And one of my favorite things about this game, is the community. Thankfully Bethesda though of a way to stop griefers with the combat system. If someone shoots at you, they cant damage you or kill you till you attack them back, and then yall can fight. When i first started the game, people would drop me Stimpacks (to heal) and Radaways (to get rid of rads)/ Both of those items are very important to the game.

VATS not hitting, VATS finally hitting but the enemy gets it's hp back, enemies randomly dying around you for no reason, fast travelling that fails often, enemies spawning naked and can't be killed (and which can eventually hit you while not moving at all so you're getting beaten up by a ghost), enemies that can't be looted ... etc.

The endgame, which consist of pretty much ONLY killing the scorched beast queen, is also 2 years old and gives almost no purposes. Nuking is only used to get mats to get ""flux"" which are mainly used to craft expensive better ammos which aren't even needed and will only be used to get more flux to repeat the cycle. Wow! 

The whole endgame is this -> do your dailies to cap on your currencies (takes like 1 hour top) aaaand that's it. Repeat for a few months to finally get rewards you'll never use because you're already bored to death of the game anyway.

Hunting for legendary enemies mostly consist of visiting a zone (which hopefully have enemies that scaled to your level or else you can just skip the whole zone), EVENTUALLY finding one which have a 95+% chance of giving you something you'll just leave on the ground cause your cache is already full of legendary junk no one wants, repeat with some few known hotspots and hop server.

The only enjoyable part of the game is the main story and the early game ... 

IF this game was just another fallout game which wasn't online, I could give it a good review but for a game that supposed to be online with a paying subscription to be able to fully enjoy it, it's a big NOPE.

I know this game has ton of potential but Bethesda just doesn't care or is too busy with something else.

43,Fallout 76,73101617,english,"Do you recommend this game? No? Yes? Maybe? It's very complicated.
Fallout 76 takes out all the things that make fallout a great game and throws it aside in favor of the gameplay loop of fallout 4. And it sorta works? Kinnda?

I wish there was a MIXED option because I would chose that instead.

The good:

-The perk cards are surprisingly well balanced for the most part. They offer a lot of situational cards for niche players who want to try unique and wacky builds while also offering more generalized cards for those who want a more laid back experience. Serums add a lot of variety to how you can play the game and stack with perks for some pretty wacky combos. Want to oneshot every legendary enemy you find with a guitar sword? You can do that.

-Unlike fallout 4 you can build pretty much wherever you want for the most part. This allows you to build a house alongside a destroyed road or build next to a cliffside or river for the aesthetic. You can build a shop to sell your rare gear to other players or build near resources to have them gather while you're out exploring the wasteland. However; what you can do with your CAMP and SHOP is sadly very limited (see cons)

-New gear, enemies to fight, places to explore, events to partake in, junk to collect, etc. The lighting and the landscape of WV looks great, when it works that is. Seeing places I've personally been too such as Harpers Ferry and Berkeley Springs in the game is a nice touch.

 The Meh:

-Gunplay. It's alright I guess. Vats is real time of course and it's very niche requiring perks and guns with VATS perks on them to be truly viable. Guns are wonky and recoil is either not there at all or so over the top. Many animations are stilted and don't look like any real effort was put into them. Any gun can be viable post 50 with the right build.

-Characters. Most of the characters are just poorly written or downright obnoxious. Meg is interesting and brings a humanizing dynamic to the raiders, but surprise surprise it's all surface level and not expanded on. Also please give me an audio slider so I can just mute Rose already thank you.

-Story. There's a story? It's there, but it's all surface level. It's about what I expect from a game that was released about 7 years too early.

The bad: Strap in for this one cuz holy **** there's a lot of it.

-The Endgame. Get me out... The endgame is just tedium and meaningless. The only real thing left to do when you're well past 50 is to just min max gear and weapons. Events are painfully easy at this point and even Scorched earth is over in a minute or two. Character progression is solely based on the quality of gear you obtain or the new perks you shift over to post 50. Some of the end game gear can be VERY VERY expensive which brings me to my next complaint.

-The ""Economy"". In 76 you can set up a shop to sell your gear and goods to other players. However, many items in this game are worth well over the cap limit of 25000 caps and require ""mule"" characters in which their only purpose is to hold caps. There are no guilds or clans, global merchants or local ones where players can sell items to anyone on any server like in ESO. The closest thing to MM we have here is NukaCrypt which really only deals in late game legendaries. Bethesda has set prices for all items and plans in the game but I can assure you they aren't worth anywhere near what bethesda says they are. This leaves some players grossly overcharging for items or accidentally undercharging by a significant margin. There is no addon that collects the sell data of all items from global guilds traders like TTC or MM in ESO, so there is only APPROXIMATE guesses at items worth. Prices are all over the place.

-Plans. You want to build/mod/craft literally anything? You need to find or buy a plan for it. On the surface this is fine but the problem is with how many plans there are in the game; there's just too many of them. So much of the mid late game is spent hopping from base to base or server to server in search of a plan just to build a stupid trashcan in your base or add a certain stock to your rifle. Add guilds and guilds merchants like eso where anyone on any server can buy from them and guilds can compete on having them for the week to alleviate this issue.

-Base Building. It's severely limited in build size and the amount of items you can put in your base. The clipping is horrible, some corner pieces that should exist don't, most if not all the cool base parts are locked behind a limited time paywall in the atom shop, foundations float for no reason, grass/trees clip through walls and buildings, you spawn inside the ground or in walls, the list could go on. It's by far the worse building system in any game ever. FO4 was pretty alright how did you **** this up?

-PvP and workshops. Pointless. Just pointless. That's it.

-Fallout 1st. No bethesda, no. It's pretty similar to ESO+ but ESO actually has an endgame, and guilds, and economy, and events, and DLC, and... you get the point.

-Performance and AI. Lag spikes, frame dips, low avg FPS, visual and lighting artifacts, server crashes, game crashes, you name it. AI is brain dead and just stands there or charges you. The only smart thing I notice they do is they walk away from grenades. Truly a spectacle of programming. 

-The World. It's laughably small. How many times larger than FO4 was it Todd? Like 4 times larger? And you know what it all is? Boarded up buildings that are nothing but shells that you can't access or empty dead forest. A town can have like 30 buildings but only 3 or 4 you will actually be able to explore. So many times I've said to myself ""I wonder whats in that building"" and the answer was ""nothing cuz you can't go in it lol idiot buy more atoms"". There's even areas that USED to be explorable but aren't anymore for whatever stupid reason.

-Vaults. They just ain't here...     F


Meh, just Meh. I wanted to get to the end end game before writing a review and it really wasn't worth it. The first 40 levels of this game are its strongest points. Honestly, just play fallout 4 with a million mods. I've modded FO4 to play like tarkov, or like an actual nuclear wasteland, or a zombie survival game with base building and defense and it's just so much better than this.

The in-game currency to purchase cosmetics, Atoms, are available to everyone as long as they complete a task. These tasks can be very hard but also very easy.

Didn't expect to say this but it's really quite fun! Sure there are a few bugs but obviously nowhere near as many as when the game first launched. It gives you that authentic Fallout 4 experience with the additional ""thrill"" of being in a live world with other players, and that's all I really expected from the game. Clearly they've since filled it out quite a bit with quests, some kind of storyline and NPC's which makes it feel more ""lived in"". Player base is really supportive, haven't encountered any trolly type players, and even if you tend to play solo then it's nice occasionally to jump into spontaneous team events. The C.A.M.P feature I really like as I enjoy building. The workshops are interesting in theory but there is little real incentive in investing materials into building them up because as soon as you log off you'll lose them. Sometimes it's hard to gauge how tough a group of enemies is until you die to them first! But these are just small gripes.

67,Fallout 76,73090166,english,"I bought this for $20 instead of full price ($40) because I was still skeptical of how the game plays after hearing about the whole first year of problems. A great benefit to this one is that I'm able to play with my friends in a Fallout world. It's what I was so excited about when the game was first announced. 

While the game definitely is far from perfect, it's still a great time. There are the usual Bethesda bugs present, but I can tolerate them. The number of players in each world is pretty limited for the map size (giant map, maybe on the order of twice the size of Fallout 4, and maybe 2 dozen people max per server). All of my experiences with other strangers so far have been either: a) None, we just ignore each other and go our merry ways, or 2) They are super excited to see me, want to show off their CAMPs, and sometimes even give me free stuff. I've enjoyed seeing some of the CAMPs people make, that's certainly been a highlight of my experience so far. While I'm sure there are griefers somewhere in the game, in my 43 hours of playing at the time of writing, I don't think I've come across one yet. So that's a big positive for me since PvP is something I actively avoid in all games.

In terms of negatives, none have been game-breaking for me yet. There are some things that make little to no sense (like not being able to put out items in your CAMP, or a limit on storage, unless you pay for the premium Fallout 1st of course), and I hope that Bethesda does something about this going forward. Not holding my breath though. The fast travel mechanic (pay to fast travel, with the cost being higher if you're trying to travel farther away) is logical, they want me to explore the map, but it gets annoying after a while. But again, not a total deal breaker.

There are lots of quests and other things to do and experience in this game. It has its flaws, but they are mostly small and quickly resolved by the developers. Because of the Wastelanders update, I will call this game a good installment in the Fallout series, and a good game in general.
I see that a lot of the negative reviews repeat the same message; lack of endgame content. This is not true, Fallout 76 do have good endgame content. Of course, if you 100% the game on your 3rd in-game character, it will start to be boring - that's not just Fallout 76, but all games.

93,Fallout 76,73044353,english,"From the roughly 20 hours I've played this game so far, it's really fun.  I've always felt that the phrase, ""It's about the journey, not the destination."" applies to many things, including games.  I definitely believe it applies here.  I'm no where near any sort of end game yet, but what I have played has been very enjoyable.  The beginning couple hours can be kind of frustrating, just trying to figure out the little differences between 76 and its predecessors, but after a while I personally got back into what I'll lovingly call the ""Fallout rhythm"": that addictive forward momentum that keeps you playing hours after you said you were done.

It seems like the major issues that are had with this game involves ""end game"" problems, as well as some bugs.  Personally, I've experienced very few bugs, and none of them have been game breaking or terrible enough to outweigh the overwhelmingly enjoyable experience I've had playing so far.  In terms of end game, I can't speak for that, but I can speak to what we will refer to as ""Virtual Survivor's Guilt"", or VSG.

VSG is a condition in which a person pours tens of hundreds of hours into a game, only to have the ending, or ""end game"", of the game be either extremely disappointing, or, as I suspect is the case with this game, become so easy and trivial to get around that the person feels the time and effort they put in to accomplishing the same task was an absolute waste of time.  The gamer becomes extremely hurt and angered by this turn of events, having spent countless hours to get to the end game, while other, more nefarious players have in effect cheated their way to the top.  This, of course, leads to the gamer feeling betrayed, and the only course of action they have to vindicate themselves and justify the perceived loss is to forget the joy they had playing the game before these moments occurred, and negatively criticize the game for what they are experiencing NOW, in this moment.  This can also be categorized as the ""It's Not Fair"" syndrome.

I firmly believe that the amount of hours you can get out of a game, compared with the enjoyment you get from said hours, should be accurately reflected in how you review a game.  I also believe that if you play a game for hundreds, even thousands, of hours, it follows that the amount of joy it brings you outweighs, or at the absolute minimum, neutralizes the amount of anger it delivers, with a heavy skew towards the positive the more hours you put in.  To spend so many hours playing a game and then saying you hate it or it's not worth even trying suggests that one is either a masochist, a liar, or is unable to weigh long term feelings and experiences against short term ones effectively.

 If you simply enjoy Fallout games, it's worth a go.  It's not gonna be Fallout 3 or New Vegas, but I think it'll scratch that itch for Fallout as a whole if you give it a chance.  Yes, you can play solo, I usually do.  Just note that there are other ppl walking around, but you don't have to interact unless YOU want to.  Yes, people set nukes off, but they're in little isolated areas of the map, mostly in the same spots, and you don't have to worry about them at all as you're going through your quests and story stuff, at least from my experience.  The few people that have interacted with me (only through emojis) were extremely nice and gave me tons of helpful supplies and things for nothing, as well as just helping me out to kill tough bosses (no party or talking required if you don't want.  I'm a hermit, so I can vouch for this lol).

Having spewed that full course word dinner, I'll leave it at this.  If you wanna play this game to become the coolest, strongest, most respected player with the best, rarest stuff to show off to friends and/or other people online, this is probably a no go for you, considering the possibility that others can get the same for much less work.  If you wanna play with friends and others and that doesn't matter to you, I think you'll have fun.  And if you just legitimately love Fallout games, the ones from 3 onward, and you wanna play by yourself and enjoy the game for that reason, as opposed to worrying about what others are or aren't doing, then I'm pretty sure you'll love it.  Oh, and you don't have to spend a dime on microtransactions or any of that to experience the full game.  Once you get your Fallout grind going, it's basically just the same as any of the other ones.

Much Love!

94,Fallout 76,72329256,english,"Update: The further and further I get the more bugs I'm running into. Don't buy unless its on sale and you're a fan of the series.

Didn't buy until it was on sale and after the wastelanders expansion came out because of all the negative reviews this game got from players. Aside from the worthless atom shop and other cash grabs, the game itself is extremely close to a vanilla Fallout 4 survival experience, with the only difference being that you get to respawn with all your gear at a location of your choice (minus any junk you picked up). 

Because it's an online experience, you don't have to tap F5 all the time or manually save your game. So far the experience with other players around has been pretty seamless. Events will occur nearby and other players showup, nobody has to communicate or manually team up, just instant group content on the fly. Can't say I've seen a smoother experience there.

If you like the single player fallout experience of exploring, looting, crafting, upgrading, repairing, rinse and repeat, then this is the fallout game of choice. In my experience few players bother chatting with each other as the multiplayer content is intuitive enough that you don't need to. Periodically you might get disconnected from a server, seems to be quite rare as its only happened twice in the 36 hours I've been playing so far, but launching the game and getting into a server takes all of 15-20 seconds at most, no messing around with this game.

Long story short, most of the problems people complained about on youtube and elsewhere seem to be gone. I've yet to run into trollish players that goad you into unwanted pvp, and the human NPC's are well designed and fleshed out. Your junk stash is 800 lbs by default, which seems plenty enough if you're not a total pack rat. You can still walk around fully encumbered, so just move you camp near a shop and lug your excess garbage to a vender. 

It seems those who played this game at launch were unfortunate guinea pigs and probably won't ever appreciate how the game presents itself to people just trying 76 now for the first time. Without all the baggage and the political grievances, I'm loving the game in it's present state, and half the time I forget I'm playing an online game. Servers are smooth and rarely lag.

2,Fallout 76,70111169,english,"UPDATE: This is an update of my review of Fallout 76.

When I first bought this game it was a couple days after the wastelanders dlc launched. I had never played 76 prior to that. In the beginning the game was extremely difficult as you are put into survival mode with no way to turn it off. Not that I don't like it, it's just a ""grind"" in the game. We'll get back to that.

As I played the game the easiest way to level up was to play through with a friend. This is the only fun part of the game mind you, however, if you have no one to play with and its all solo (even if you are with friends) you will be GRINDING every minute of the game to get any where. You heavily are awaiting that next level up to get that next perk to become a stronger character, and cap out at level 50. At this point you can only have so many perk cards, and if you don't have a good set up you character will be roach meat. If you have good perk cards you'll be mutant meat. 

Point is no matter how you play this game you are fighting constantly for resources that take away from doing quests or events. You are kill as many times as dark souls depending on your perks and level. After all that grinding for say 5 hours all you have is a damaged gun, no ammo, ammo you don't use (and can't trade/converter that doesn't work), broken armor, and resources that are useless, as the resources you need require further GRIND.

If you buy this game, buy it when it is at least $10. I see people say $20, and I don't think it's worth that. Just disappointed with this game. There are good things about it, but this is the main reason I am writing this review. This is honestly the worst part of the game aside from hackers (thankfully I never dealt with that,.... yet)",1590953111,1595281036,FALSE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,70,4,7335,0,2821,1599955106

I have a love/hate relationship with this game, it's loads of fun to play with a team of 3 other friends, but quite lackluster on my own. The game is still considerably unstable for a Triple A title, with many visual bugs and glitches. Among what I have experienced include:
-Losing all of my stimpaks
-paying caps to fast travel to free locations
-multiple game crashes
-issues concerning building mechanics that prevent objects from being placed
-unable to collect items off bodies
-many PvP glitches
-(WORST of all) My atoms totaling 800 are displayed as only 310 in the atom shop. My friends also have this problem. 
Another trivial problem I have with the game is a lack of ladders. It makes building houses on steep terrain extremely difficult as it is hard to cover vertical ground within your build limits. The height limit is also very low. 
Overall, this game is best suited for more patient players who also have friends that are willing to blow 40 dollars on this game. I hate this game but can't stop playing it with my friends.

Hard to belive but these are bugs that are still in the game since 2 years now and nothing changed... in the good way.

I got that game and allready felt bad for the friend how gifted it to me but he told me it would be fine. ""20 hours later was 19 hours longer then my friend could play that game befor he agreed to what i was thinking. Honestly i really wanted to give this game a go and really tried to get into it but these bugs... and these texturebugs... what is this? There first beta-try for the real Fallout76? I mean the only think that growth while playing was the respect for those how played that... think in 2018. How could they endure it, if what we got is so much better then it was befor? So back to less rant and more facts.

fact 1 -> after steam-achivments only 33.2% of ALL player reached lvl 10. LEVEL 10!!!
fact 2 -> these lags... are they just to make sure you really wanna waste 15 bucks to play on a privat server?
fact 3 -> them lags! really... you got hit from shoots/melee-attacks that clearly missing you by 10 feet
fact 4 -> poofing enemies... had them alot, wasted alot of ammo on them just to see them disappearing
fact 5 -> guns that you can only use after reaching a specific lvl.. yeah at lvl 5 i am to dumb to hold a 44...
fact 6 -> these persk... this perksystem... just no.
fact 7 -> nuclear strike! nuclear strike! nuclear strike! every 30 minutes...
fact 8 -> weight... two guns that is ok. Four guns... NOPe these are to heavy for you. 
fact 9 -> Oh they are breaking to fast for that? Well go spend money and buy a reapairkit!
fact 10 -> every 10 steps some event pop in your face and you lose track of the quest you need to do
fact 11 -> C.A.M.P. your storage is full? Build a cam.... oh wait sorry this place is occupied. This one too etc.
fact 12 -> quest navigation. ""go kill that think"" ""ok where is it?"" ""i don`t know but it... somehwere."" yeah -.-
fact 13 -> buggy objects. It really is annoying shooting at a ghule only to find out he was behind a car you can`t see...

Feedback: Fix that trash and mybe i 3 years it could be game or do what you allways do Bethesda... Wait till the community fixed it for you and then just sell it as your work in a remastered edition or defiance edition, like in skyrim and what i suppose, fallout 4 and 3 and oblivion etc. But then with one dlc for each single piece...

Update: So i played that game now for 74 Hours and i can just say... waste of time in short. Really it can`t not discribed in any other way. I was thinking the F4-Quest where kinda boring from time to time. But mostly they just sending you somewhere once! But in Fallout76 they send you back and forward like the dumbest quest in an MMORPG. And just when you think i can`t be worst. You meet Rose. And she... she... i don`t know but after the third time she sended me out to a clear death, i just wanted to shoot her. I didn`t care anymore about any dumb story in this game. I was done(!) listening to that whining lady that pretend to be an vault overseer. All her whining and crying about  OHHHH what she all lost when the nukes droped. The level-Jump f the enemies is the cherry on top of that all. First you run from one lvl 1 to an lvl 5 then back to lvl 1 and then, just behind the next corner of a ruin a friendly lvl 64 waits to oneshoot you.  Not to forget the lovly robots. You shoot there arms, because you know that makes them go suicid and safes you ammo. They explod and you sneak to the corpse and... the corpse explodes again and takes you with him to a burning grave. I don`t understand how so many people can vote that game for good?

96,Fallout 76,67984787,english,"So, lets air out the obvious first: (this was a positive review, until the latest notes went live about seasons and such)
The practice with this game, have shown that they are willing to go over corpses for money, this is Todd, this is Pete and main management. There is greed that makes EA feel small and ashamed over that they did not aim this low, to try swindle people out of money.

There is no getting around this, it is just the lust for cash, nothing else from these people, and their willingness to step over corpses to get there. 

Bugs, there are so many bugs, and shitty response from support and horrible patching and practice around this.
The cash grab store with repair packs, and increased decay on parts to try force people to buy repair packs and scrap packs.
And the sub that makes MMO asking why have we not aimed this low to scam people out of cash? Like I said, someone at EA is sleeping badly over the fact that they where not aiming this low and still getting cash on it.

So, you are asking, why am writing a positive review, with that start? (was positive)
Well, this is fallout, I like fallout, and after waiting 1.5 years, i decided if it was super terrible, I could always just refund it via steam.

And so it began: I woke alone, a voice told me that go out there, good times are over, get on and out of the vault, nobody cares about you! And it was great!
So this is the wasteland edition, so you can choose to do the new stuff and old etc. I did not, I just put all the new quests on hold, and started following tapes. And finding a dead world that does not give a shit about you, or just tries to kill you instantly if you walk the wrong way, this is fallout in it's essence! A dead world, the original sin haunting you for every move you make and when you meet people or settlers (was added with current addon) I am reminded of ""the sins of our fathers"" and the outcome that this have produced.
It is grim, and dark, and even depressing to hear some of these tapes, that they lived through the big bang, and only to be killed because the shadows of our sins have far reaching consequences, long after those who did is buried and dead.
If you want real life examples, look at the world today, and trace the lines back to the great war and so on etc.

In fact, I was almost tempted to buy the sub, just to be more alone, to be in a dead world. But there are limits to how much I can reward scumms at upper management.

This is a fallout I can like, and yes I cant always ignore the bastard tactics from upper management etc. But without playing any of the new content, this is fallout, a dead world where even those that tried got wiped out the by the sins of our fathers.
I would even go as far to say, that as a fallout game, it is even better than Fallout 4 (you have to ignore blatant bugs/scumms etc) Because it tries to BE fallout, and not whatever the fuck fallout 4 was.

so as fallout goes, this is good, as everything else goes, well that is your decision, and your money/time, use it wisely and be safe out there in these trying times.

So about 250 hours later, all the main quests done. all that is left now is just grind for repair stuff(repair costs too much) and well daily. And with the upcoming new changes with removal of earning currency and grind fests that you can buy with real money out of..no thank you.
I got to play the fallout I wanted, but the rest of the game is worthless and is about to become nothing more than a milking cow for Todd's second tesla purchase, I doubt we will ever see fallout 5 at this rate, as they will rather milk the online services, than create anything more that costs money.

And as learning the following, dying during forced server change= bye bye inventory. First nuke done, and server change just as i hit launch..very nice stuff that. And lost inventory on mine runs etc. 
Yeah I am done with this game for now!",1587807778,1595000734,FALSE,0,0,0.476190478,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,196,41,19342,0,865,1598373310
97,Fallout 76,72846462,english,"Fallout 76 is an odd game. Would I recommend it? Yes and no. I know, this is not helpful, but bear with me a minute as I elaborate...

If you go into the game expecting this to be a ""real Fallout"" game (i.e. you are a fan or have played and liked the old Fallout 1 and 2 at least), then no, this is not the game for you. Do NOT buy it. This is NOT a Fallout game. 
However, if you go into the game expecting an exploration game in Fallout disguise, then you're going to love this game. 

As any Bethesda game, the game revolves around you being sent to places, exploring them, doing some menial task, looting everything and then coming back to your base to scrap them. Craft new stuff, get more power, to repeat the loop again. 
If that kind of loop (explore, loot, craft) does not appeal to you, then you will NOT like 76. This is what 76 is all about with a few side ""systems"" sprinkled in for ""let's add some extra fun's sake"". 

You can build your character the way you want but the character builder has nothing to do with Fallout's original setup, this is a completely new system. The SPECIAL system exist but mostly in name. The character builds are varied but unfortunately you're going to be met with one very important choice; either you play the meta game in character building or you don't. If you don't, your character will always be sub par and won't be at its top power, in fact it could probably function at a 60-80% depending on what you're building. If you do play the meta game and go through finding a theme for your character (i.e. put yourself at some form of disadvantage to increase your DPS and thus effectiveness), you're going to faceroll the whole game. Personally I didn't bother with the meta game and am doing quite fine contributing well into any scenario I am in except the final game boss which takes quite a bit of work from my end to be a meaningful contributor. 
This brings the next point. 

There is no ""end game"". Once you finish the story line, you're left with nothing to do but the same events you've been doing for the past 50+ hours OVER and OVER again. Nothing else to be doing unless you want to grind the stupid Skinner box crappy new progression system that is full of cosmetics and meaningless rewards. 

So why did I have 280+ hours? Because I was never sure what build I wanted. So I kept leveling up to change my stats. In the game the only way to change your stats (i.e. change Perception from 5 to 6 for example) is to level up past level 50 (level 50 is highest level in game). So I had to slog through level 130 to finally gain enough points to rework my entire SPECIAL and gain a few extra in case I decided to change again. 

So is the game worth it? Sure, if you like multiplayer games with a coop focus that is more ""in and out"" unless you have friends. Sure if you like the loop I mentioned above. 

Other than this? Don't even bother.",1594999878,1594999878,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,111,3,16951,0,16951,1593860526

I knew they added a shit ton of stuff since I last played so I gave this game another chance. And now I can say that this game in its current state should have been what it was when it was released. First off, the npcs were greatly needed. Fallout 76 before any updates was pretty bland, and npcs just gave it more of a fallout feel to it. Fallout 76 is a great spin-off fallout game. While I would prefer previous; main series, fallout games, this one doesn't feel entirely like a fallout game. First off the map is fucking huge. In my almost 70 hours I haven't explored even 1/3 of the locations. 2nd, the npcs introduced aren't mass populating the map. They are scattered, with a few traders and settlers wandering. It gives it more of a early fallout vibe, people are only starting to get comfortable with living in the wasteland, and I appreciate that. 3rd, multiplayer. The multiplayer is nearly perfected in the aspect of a fallout game. Although I wish there were a few more people that could be on a server, it never feels over crowded. You rarely come into contact with people and if you do it's usually because of events. In my experience I've only been killed by a human player once, in which I attacked first because they were wanted. Most of the time players will be helpful and give lower level players some decent gear. Also, there is so much stuff to do this this game. Events and daily quests, although repeatable, can always give you something to do, while getting some loot, caps and xp. The story is pretty meh, and although I haven't finished, quest lines are much better with npcs from when I first played. All in all, I'm pretty addicted to this game right now and I'm glad they are continuously updating it, with 2 more major updates coming out sometime this year. So it is nice that I can come back to a fallout game with fresh content instead of replaying it for the 5th time like the other entries. There are A LOT of bugs, but very few are major. Most of the time I see a enemy or npc not behaving in some way, or I'll get stuck for a few seconds sometimes, but doesn't ever frustrate me enough to hate on it. But sometimes they can be pretty annoying. In conclusion, don't treat this like a fallout game. Fans, including myself bashed this game a lot, but I realized this wasn't meant to be a traditional fallout game with multiplayer implemented. This game will keep you busy if you like it.

Worth the buy, especially if you love the fallout series.

As I type this, there's little point in playing anymore today.  Can't pick things up as I'm out of space, can't sell anything because no one will buy anything until tomorrow, can't do faction missions as they are Daily, and so on.   Even spending real money is of limited use, as it doesn't simply expand your storage, it gives you an annoying second type of storage that you have to move things around in in order to craft with the items.  Awesome feature - if you want to play SINGLE PLAYER you have to pay monthly.  What a treat.  It's a low effort offering.  It's based on Fallout 4, thankfully, because if this was written from scratch with the amount of effort they put in it wouldn't run at all.

They'll easily recoup their investment and forget about what this could have been.

[h1]First Impression[/h1]
[b]Fallout 76[/b] is a title that, despite fixing many of the problems placating it, fails to impress and still suffers from some terrible issues. Playing with friends and with low expectations, it can be a fun game, but going solo or demanding too much from it can result in a bitter taste. Featuring multiple fetch quests, bugs, glitches, and overall empty wasteland, and quest that don't catch the magic of the series, read on to find out why the vault 76 might not be the place to be on an apocalypse.

[h1]Some gears have been fixed, but the machine still runs poorly[/h1]
[b]Fallout 76[/b] is a decent game that does not live up to the standard it sets for itself. The launch of the titles was a mess during the release date, and despite arriving at [b]Steam[/b] with multiple fixes, it does not manage to get the job done. The title is still full of glitches and bugs such as enemies dying in the infamous T-pose, unbalanced scaling level of enemies' base on players in the surroundings, weak AI, and quest objectives not refreshing plus many more.

Some examples of these are the following: I can be in an area doing level 15 quest if there is another player of level 75 in the same area, enemies in my pursuit will get up to level 75. Situations can be as absurd as the game telling you to fight a level 67 ghoul only for you to die instantly. To fix this issue, you must exit to the main screen and then log back into the world either once or twice. It is not acceptable as it dampers the experience and ruins it. There is a disastrous game system.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2168172093

Other issues can be found in questlines not updating themselves or objective being represented poorly on the map. On a quest, I was to use explosive bait in an area, yet if there are no enemies in the said area at the time, the quest requirements will not be accomplished. You will also not be refunded the item needed for it, which means you will need to craft it again. It doesn't help that majority of the questline demand the player to transverse segments of [b]Appalachia.[/b]

[h1] Enemies lacking intelligence [/h1]
One aspect that can make a game so much more enjoyable is that the enemies you face in it display some level of intelligence or adaptation, as it created dynamic combat that never bores. In [b]Fallout 76,[/b] enemies lack this so much needed mechanism. During my time with the title, I didn't like how for example, I can face against a [b]Deathclaw,[/b] one of [b]Fallout's[/b] dangerous creatures and defeat it by running around a pole while shooting at it. Nothing is giving them special features or a way to catch up to the player. And it is not like I do that by purpose, a quest took me to it, and I had to deal with it to recover my items as I died from a fall.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2168175350

It does not help that the combat system has a slow tempo. Adding levels to [b]Fallout[/b] is a mistake, in my opinion, as you find yourself smacking enemies for a long time before they die. After logging to downscale them to my level, I find out even the most thrilling encounters are a game of [b]Zig-zag[/b] in which you kite enemies until they die. They can resist your bullets and melee weapons as they deal with moderate damage, and it ends up creating rather monotonous pacing in these fights. Combat is boring even at the right level, and sometimes enemies can one-shot you due to bugs.

As a compensation of sorts, they introduced the [b]Legendary Run[/b] which behaves as a sort of season pass for free. The rewards they hand out are range between decent and excellent, so I give credit where it is due. It is an invitation to keep playing the game and get rewarded for doing so.

[h1] Strong and Weak Points[/h1]
[b]Fallout 76[/b] strong points are the perk system and making camps. The perk system introduces us to a variety of perks that have been correctly implementing in the game from previous entries plus some new ones. From the ability to be a cannibal and regain HP by devouring corpses, to getting bonuses when traveling solo or with friends, they are powerful and entertaining tools at the player disposal. Making camps is enjoyable as well, as the system is pretty free, and you can make yourself a cozy home to return to after questing. They can be attacked by enemies, armed with defenses, visited by fellow players, and more!

The weakest points here are the questline and the combat. My first hours with the game were enjoyable, but that died as I keep going thanks to these two elements. The questline lacked a lot of dialogs and appealing choices to keep things entertaining, and this can be perceived in the repetitive missions that feel more like they are there to fill a content ""gap"" rather than be a part of the game. The slow combat is annoying as it takes to long to kill important enemies and even some basic ones, becoming a sort of fighter game rather than a survival one.

[h1]X Notes[/h1]
I do like that the game looks beautiful, and this is mostly due to the lighting effects done effectively. There is also a [b]Photo mode[/b], so feel free to take gorgeous screenshots of the surroundings! I had a good time with said feature, and they did an admirable job with the environments that range from radiation storms to abandoned military buildings or nature rivers becoming a part of desolated cities.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2168178760

There is a lot of desolation, and not in the proper sense. When you play, unless you bring friends, you will rarely interact with other players. There is just no incentive to doing so, and events don't cover up except for the final one. Another thing I dislike is that everywhere you go, you find the same enemies again and again. [b]Ghouls and robots[/b] are the most common and predominant types of foes in the wastelands. I did encounter two [b]Deathclaws[/b] and a particular event enemy, but during the majority of my playtime in different areas, it was always the same kinds of creatures.

[h1] Finally…[/h1]
Despite my harsh treatment towards [b]Fallout 76,[/b], I do think it is a game in which you can have fun with your friends and enjoy it. I don't recommend it because for the price it asks and from the franchise it comes from, it doesn't meet the standards. It is a below-average title, and I recommend you to check alternatives. Such as [b]Outer Worlds[/b], which will come to [b]Steam[/b] later this year and is a new title or the acclaimed [b]Fallout: New Vegas,[/b] especially if playing solo!

19,Fallout 76,72784318,english,"Con:
- Graphics are quite outdated, especially the reflections in dark areas are horrible (everything looks super shiny then).
- Doesn't always run really well (> 30fps).
- You basically have to pay for Fallout 1st (15€/month) to not be ridiculously limited by the storage space with all the collected crafting junk. 
- Most questlines aren't really that interesting compared to what other Fallout titles had.
- The gunplay is rather bad. Fighting other enemies at gun range is ok, but when they get near in your shit and you don't have a decent melee weapon, it can get quite frustrating (especially with ghouls).
- Not sure why they decided to change VATS to what it is, but it's super bad. It's now an aimbot with a % hit chance.
Pro:
- I really enjoy the multiplayer part with the few other players on each server. You're alone most of the time but can meet other players or see their homes from time to time, it's a nice touch and makes the world feel more alive.
- The C.A.M.P (base) building is fun.
- The crafting system isn't half bad either.
- Even with the outdated graphics, you can get some beautiful scenes at times.
- The ambient sounds are amazing.
- Exploration still is very fun and gets rewarded by loot or funny sceneries.
- The Fallout humour is still there.
- Even with all its shortcomings, it's still a decent Fallout game.

The subscription model also now means the game has been monetized in three different ways; initial game price, micro-transactions, and a subscription model.  At least with most mobile games that have the same level of micro-transactions, the game usually has the courtesy of being free.

The inability to play this game without other humans ruining your experience unless you want to pay for the subscription is a new low from Bethesda, especially for a series that was always single-player focused until this point.  Subscription or not, you still need to connect to an online server to play.  I was made aware of this fact when the server dropped me right after I left Vault 76.  Some introduction there Bethesda.

I purchased this game last week with a friend and we have been having ample amounts of fun on it but I have recently over the past few days gotten to end game and launched a nuke a few times and farmed materials to the point where my storage is full of valuable goods. I then decided to build more stash boxes to find out all stash boxes are linked and dont increase the weight at all and the only way to get more stash weight is to pay $12 a month or $100 a year for unlimited junk storage. 

For those of you that havent played the game yet you wont release how much of a pay to win this actually is because once your storage is full of valuables it means you can no longer pick anything up without going overweight and if you're overweight you cant fast travel to friends or events which means you are pretty much going through the game killing mobs solo and never picking anything up which just sucks. 

Aside from that there isnt really much of an endgame if you really wanted you could start fresh, level up and complete the nuke questline in just a few days and then do nuke loops which is the current endgame. Although if you are a completionist there is a ton of quests to do.

I personally got it on sale so the small amount i paid for a week of fun was pretty good its just a shame Bethesda had to be greedy and lock the stash weight perk behind a paywall.",1594805687,1594805687,TRUE,2,0,0.522291541,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,45,2,3358,0,3358,1594733676

40,Fallout 76,72711658,english,"Mostly a rushed fallout 4 mod, you can have fun with it yes, but everything's fucked, laggy 60% of the times, bugged 80% of the times, mobs dead before you even can do anything to them, overleveld mobs near your main mission area,  or in low level areas or really low leveled mobs everywhere else, fucking stash limit is 800 it fills up real quick. dont forget this game also brought back the repair mechanic so you can at least use up most of the junk you find, Gl finding a weapon at your level that wont break after a couple of shots/fights. Sneak is almost good if the jmobs wouldn´t glitch out after a sneak shot get alerted and regen instantly the damage you've done due to bad AI. The performance and visuals on this game goes from ps1 graphics to fallout 4 on low settings and good luck playing this game above 40 fps without tweaking with your graphics settings and fallout.ini files, theres huge stutterings each 10 to 20 seconds if your near a main area with other players. Mobs teleport to you (molerats, radscorpions, some bloatflies) even if you've hit a sneak attack on them and are still ""safe"" in [caution] levels and really far away from them. You thought this would be like fallout 4 on expert+ difficult where you can get legendaries at least regularly nah fam you get one each 3 days and its not what you use or with stats that wont even help you in the long run. You can sell those for legendary tokens that you can trade with guess what ? randomized overall loot, you get to pick, armor - melee or ranged weapons from 1* to 3* but its price almost doesn't make it worth your time leveling up. theres also diseases, the adition witch depending on your ""random"" perk cards you either can be decent with addictions or the addictions only get away with adictol which basically are rare. i've been playing for 44 hours and i've only been lucky to found a single one. melee weapons feel clunky and sneaking with them is mostly not worth at all because if they glitch and instantly know where you are from miles away even with 3 pieces of shadowed gear and perks on sneak perks its not even worth. so you decide this was just a few hours of me playing through this. IMO its not worth even the 13 euros i gave for it. you can buy fallout 4 with adventure mods  and textures way way better than this. I was lucky to start playing AFTER they've added human NPC's, i'm following the current main mission and its all robots, either robots or a single human creature thats called the overseer, and i'm not even sure if it was added only after this update. I hate robots so damned much on this game, they are clunky invulnerable most of the times due to lag, melee weapons do jack shit to them, critical spots on them feel like hitting a brick wall with pencils even if you have a armor pen legendary sniper.

41,Fallout 76,72704743,english,"The good
- Humongous map to explore, lots of detail went into this.
- The addition of NPC's and questlines have been well thought out and very fun to experience.
- This does feel like a Fallout game to me.
- I actually have come to like the ""live"" VATS system, as there is no slow or stop motion to select targets or limbs.  It feels a little more realistic and challenging to use, but still effective.

The Bad
- The constant daily quest alerts can get tedious to listen to.
- It costs Caps to travel and not a fan of that.  After awhile, I just started not caring about saving Caps and began blowing through large amounts to quickly travel from point to point.  The alternative was wasting tedious and boring amounts of time wading through thick foliage.  (A positive note is that you can free travel to Vault 76 or your CAMP.)
- I had a lot of trouble looting dead enemies, as they can easily blend with the ground.
- When following the main and side quest lines (which is my style of play - not interested in PvP), more and more destinations suddenly fill up with extremely over-powered enemies.  I feel there is no middle ground here, as it has happened with every Main and Side quest.  Completing one quest leg and moving on to the next is like running into a brick wall.  This is the single biggest issue I have with the game, and enough for me to walk away for awhile, as it seems that there is no other solution than grinding dailies at this point.

The exploration is nice, I enjoy the scavenging and crafting (although it often turns into tedium in longer sessions). It's great having other players in a Fallout game. 

Unfortunately, the game is extremely buggy. You'll probably encounter a minor bug every few minutes and a major one every few hours. That I'm still enjoying this game shows the strength of the core content. I will say that there has been a ton of criticism of the end-game, due to few viable character builds, no purpose aside from grinding, and artificial limits on storage and each of the dozen or so half-baked in-game currencies that someone at Bethesda thought were a good idea. Since I'm 70 hours in and nowhere near the end game, I'm willing to accept the game might get boring after I've played 200 hours. That's pretty good value, especially at the sale price of $20.

I went into this as a Fallout series fan but even with the time they've had since the launch fiasco, they haven't really fixed the core issue which has to be lack of content. The main story line is just a series of fetch-quests with a handful of overwhelmingly forgetful characters and the Wastelander update is really more of the same. They added human characters which is nice and had a few different sorts of quests but it's ultimately just not much. 

I imagine they expected the multiplayer aspect to bolster the content but it's barely even meaningfully multiplayer. You can tag along with someone while they complete quests and go do one of a series of repeated events every so often but the only bases you can build together are in workshops which reset whenever you join a new server and really just aren't worth it. My main interaction with other players is trying to find out how to price my items so they'll give me their caps.

Add onto that the fact that a significant chunk of the game seems clearly designed to push you towards microtransactions in a store with mostly overpriced cosmetic upgrades (and fallout 1st) and you've got a recipe for a hollow feeling, highly forgettable game coming at the end of a monumental hype-train.

As someone who played the game for the first time with wastelanders the game is a fun lootershooter. There are a bunch of graphical bugs, and a handful of gameplay bugs that definitely need fixed but i wouldnt say its a bad game. If you are looking for traditional fallout experience this will taste like off brand fruit loops vs the real deal, but i would say as someone not knowing what to expect from the game and spending 170 hrs in since the wastelanders launch i think its worth the 40 dollar price tag. BIG BUT their stash system is garbage and pay to win. You need junk to build any and everything in 76 and they give you a limit on how much you can store. unless you have fallout 1st which you can have infinite space for the low low cost of nearly 15 dollars. I have heard that before the addition of the fridge and repair kits in the atomic shop they nerfed all the perks for fixing gear and spoiling food. Sure you can get atom shop currency at a decent rate through just playing the game, its super distasteful to do this kind of thing. The endgame is near non-existant. You do the same 4 daily mission for the two factions for reputation, you scrap 3-5 weapons for legendary scrap to hit the scrap limit, and cash in your treasury notes to get your 200 daily gold bullions per day which you can complete in about 7-8 events. For example the new T-65 power armor costs about 5-6 weeks of continuous daily cap limit hits to get just the blueprints for the stuff. The missions to get all these ""endgame items"" are the exact same every day and are not engaging enough to be motivated to become stronger. Scorch beast queen is a push over and they made her a bullet sponge so we both just attacked eachother until the time ran out and neither of us were any close to being killed. They removed the vault raid? so you cant grind that, they have stated they have alot more coming up in terms of endgame content but right now there is no meaningful endgame. The 160 hrs i played were alot of fun especially with friends but as of right now the endgame is not there, and god forbid you want to respec when you get high level. Lets say you want to be big guns build and switch from a hand cannon build. well to move anywhere from 6-15 special points it will costs 6-15 levels. each level you can move one point not to mention you need to level up the perk card so add another 9-16 levels to pick a perk card each level and for a full respec will cost you upwards of 20 levels. they want you just to make another character and grind but the new gear is character locked so no trades.

I have no word to describe how bad this game really is from it's pathetic engine,gameplay,world,characters to the actual gameplay.
I will start with the beginning.
As soon as you enter in the game no matter what graphics preset you choose the game will run terrifyingly bad.
Now the session section is the worst.Either you play in a free to play session where you don't need to spend like over 100$/year to play alone but your enemies will be like always 50 levels above you simply pissing you off.This shit uses the same engine Fallout 4 did but it's way worse.Everything moves like crap,the shooting mechanics are broken af.Most of the time you won't even deal damage to your enemies because why not.You also get caps from missions but no worries,teleporting from one place to another helps you lose all the caps you get to not be able to actually spend it at stupid robots that sells you only the plans to craft an item not the actual items.
Your armors will broke fast af and you need tons of materials to repair them or you can simply buy a repair box for 50 atoms which will be real life 0.50$.I don't know why is this game on Steam because the only place that would accept this game would be the garbage disposal.I only bought it cause I own all the Fallout games and I loved the 4th one but this one boy-o-boy.I wouldn't recommend it to my worst enemy neither.
Grab Fallout 4 instead or don't.Simply just stay away from this franchise and Bethesda.
Now I understand why this game received so many hate and bad reviews.It hasn't changed 1 bit.It's still the same and it will always be the same.

Then this is Fallout lite, without Wastelanders I can't imagine how bare the game was on this front.

Was your favorite part the exploration, the holotapes, the notes, the terminal journals?

Then this is actually fairly satisfying!

Did you build a bunch in Fallout 4, and wish you could share it with others?

Then this is absolutely the game for you, yes, it's not perfect, and there is microtransactions, though you can purchase several decoration packs just from your free Atoms.

The creativity people display and the varied places they build make it fun not only to build but to visit other camps.

Now, are you a junk hound?

This is mixed, you can pick everything up for scrap but your stash has a weight limit and you can't display any of it. Still, there is a lot of loot and there are a couple ways to store your junk.

You could buy Fallout 1st for an unlimited scrap cache, this is a lame option, but it works. It also comes with a private world for all your trawling desires, and lets you transfer things to a mule character safely by using the private server to drop things then pick them up with other toon.

Or you can get help from a friend, if they just hold your place on the server so to speak you can switch to a mule and pick up things normally.

Jumped for the first time in to the game on July 4th. Seems like it's true that you can easily notice the difference in quest quality from the old and new. Though I do enjoy the NPC's combined with the exploration and freedom to roam around (because I'm new to the game), I do find it difficult to follow up on the questline. It really doesn't have a direct flow for the questline and you kind of have to go around all the corners of the map which means that I'm level 10 and have to go to the area where all the enemies are level 40-68 and it's ridiculous. This means, you can't proceed in the main questline and you need to work on small level fetch-quests and it's so fuckin boring.... I found myself just fast traveling and skipping dialog just to get through it all and repeat the same fetch quests over and over and over again since the game has such slow level progression. Other wise, the exploration and the reward for grind is quite fun and I enjoy playing stealthy like I did in Fallout 4. My character build is basically the same as Fallout 4: Good with pistols, expert on single shot rifles and picklocks but poor in other areas.

If you're a Fallout fan and you really need that Fallout fix, then here you go. You can play totally alone but you will come across with other players who are usually lvl 100-400 and they're dropping nukes often. A tip for new players is that you need to take your time with the early quest, do side missions a lot and try to lvl up as fast as possible in order to be able to proceed with the high level areas because the main quest line forces you to go to places where the enemies are 50 levels higher than you. Another tip is to pick up every single loot you see. Sell it or scrap it, other wise it's going to be hell for you.",1594628556,1594628556,TRUE,1,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,123,35,4098,0,2552,1595577484

I think the MANY patches combined with the absolutely necessary DLC fixed the major problems.

-Bad shop sound track

18,Fallout 76,71626779,english,"This game was trash when it launched. When I played it back at launch on the Playstation 4 it was a glitchy, un-fun, boring mess. I recently bought this game at a sale price on Steam to play a long with a buddy who was going to give it another shot. I'm glad I did! This game is in a much much better place than it was at launch. It's playable. There is plenty to explore and do. The world doesn't feel as barren and boring. NPCs to speak with make the world much better. I've spent so much time just exploring for junk to scrap and build up my Barbie Dream House. All this with a friend who built his C.A.M.P. right across the river. We're river buddies! I'd now suggest this game.

Review update: After putting in 80 hours to the game I've run into a frustrating progress-ending bug. Long story short I am literally unable to complete one of the main story missions because the enemies necessary to trigger progression are not spawning. At all. I've tried for three hours. Starting and restarting the game. A quick Google search shows this to be a common bug for people and hasn't be patched or fixed for months. I was really enjoying my time, but I've run into more bugs in this game than I can count. I was okay dealing with them because they were minor to mildly irritating. However, this bug literally halts all progression I can have in the game. Until Bethesda can get their act together and release a playable game without game breaking bugs I cannot recommend this game anymore.",1593407138,1594535899,FALSE,0,0,0.633137882,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,183,16,5170,0,676,1594709273
19,Fallout 76,72542296,english,"Despite the controversy, issues since launch, and choices that have left people angry, Fallout 76 is a Fallout game at it's core, and it's good enough that it will keep you engaged for hours if Fallout is your jam and you appreciate the pros I'm about to mention:

Pros:
- A post-apocalyptic world that FEELS like a post-apocalyptic world. Even without the addition of people I felt that way roaming the world in Fallout 76. The addition of people and the way it was done makes sense in the context.
- Great environmental storytelling like Bethesda does in the open world RPGs. Every little location tells a story, sometimes through holo, sometimes notes, sometimes just observing your surroundings as you pick it clean.
- A very solid crafting system if you like to hoard junk :) I like to pick things up and this game rewards that behaviour as junk becomes fuel for crafting, which when you follow that path can be quite rewarding in it's own way.
- Nuclear Winter is a pretty good take (IMO) on the Battle Royale craze.

Cons:
- It's a bit rough around the edges, and doesn't really look that great by today's standards.
- The limitations of inventory space (and pretty quickly stash and build limits) will have you frustrated. Somewhat alleviated by the unlimited component stash if you don't mind spending the monthly cost for fallout first (and don't care about the associate drama).",1594530614,1594530614,TRUE,1,0,0.520958066,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,503,20,7153,0,2194,1596837401
20,Fallout 76,72334633,english,"After playing 13 hours i got the hang of the game. And i have to say, for me, its really fun. It was confusing to get started at first with the whole new perk system, V.A.T.S being changed, and the whole weapons management / upgrading thing. But around hour 7 i got the hang of it, around the same hour you also get the snowball rolling, becoming more powerful the more you play. I don't know if i made a mistake or not but i accidentally stumbled upon the overseer while exploring. I also accidentally got the silo code piece for Silo Charlie (I know the code is the same everywhere, but i choose to not look it up, and instead find others under the same ideal to find the code the natural way.), and discovered Site Alpha. The lack of human NPCs does not bother me, i am completely fine taking quests from terminals /or/ robots, but from the Roadmap for 2020 it seems more questlines involving human npcs are to be added, so if you like that type of thing, i suggest you look forward to fall!. Overall, even after almost 15 hours of playtime, i enjoy this game, i haven't felt forced to grind or to buy anything yet so i think its a massive improvement over how it was before and what other people used to say about it, Good job on bethesda for managing to swing this game around!. Would be much more fun with more players mind you, but the new public teams thing sure helps in that regard. Its still fun playing alone and sometimes teaming up with a random person at times who you just meet and greet via emote, this is why i love multiplayer games, you never know what youre gonna get. The only thing i have against it, is the poo optimization (Although it may be on part due to my old 1050ti and I5 7400 setup, i dont know.). I wouldn't call myself a fallout veteran, but i have finished Fallout New Vegas, Fallout 3, Fallout 2 and Fallout 4 and at the same time i would still recommend this game to any Fallout fan that wants to take on Post-War America with multiple friends. The way they handled PVP is also incredibly well to maintain the co-op aspect of being a Vault Dweller, The way PVP works is both parties need to agree on initiating a fight. For example, Player A shoots Player B, Player B will only recieve minimal damage. Once Player B retaliates, both Player A's and Player B's weapons will deal full damage. This means you cant be ambushed by other players, and for people who like Fallout for the exploration side of things and doing quests without being bothered by other players, this is GREAT, for others who expected this to be a hardcore survival game where you can ambush people and kill them, not so much, but this isn't what Fallout is about, there are other survival multiplayer games where you can do exactly that!, Theres Rust, DayZ, Deadside and soon enough, Dead Matter. This game is built from the ground up to be cooperative, you are supposed to be the New Founders of America after the great war, so fighting amongst eachother is not a fruitful endeavour. I can't rate it a perfect 10/10 due to the optimization problem after all, but this game in my opinion is a solid 8/10 now!",1594258981,1594529716,TRUE,0,0,0.474137902,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,190,32,1155,42,42,1602016780

66,Fallout 76,72438987,english,"There's not a word of criticism about this game that isn't valid, and I honestly don't think it's responsible to be giving money to Bethesda in this day and age. But it's incorrect to say that there isn't an engaging and entertaining experience to be had here, after the content updates and bugfixes have trickled in. 

While 76 suffers from a lot of the same problems as Fallout 4, it is, in my mind, a better Fallout game in many ways. It doesn't hold a card to the Obsidian-developed entries to the series, but that doesn't mean it's completely without value as a Fallout game now. I found the factions to be interesting, and the stories of each little township moving. The longer quest-lines had me hooked, and I think this game has the best voice-acting of any post-2000 entry in the series. The incidental music is a nice tonal match for the scenery, and the world has been designed in such a way as to hide a secret or surprise everywhere the player feels compelled to look. 

Interactions with players are infrequent, but I found that an accidental side effect of this was that people seem to be happy to see a sentient face when you meet them. Every person I have met thus far either shared an emote with me to wish me well, or traded some simple items before we went our separate ways. 

You can, of course, join public events. But they're often so far away in unexplored areas that they're seemingly best left for later stages of gameplay, because the game's map is enormous. I've played 12 hours and barely felt like I've ventured into the world at all. But the teasing hint of a smoking ruin in the distance, or the terrifying sound of a shockwave from a nuclear bomb detonating far on the other side of the map helps to remind you that a mysterious and dangerous world lies beyond the horizon. 

The focus on survival has given the game a sense of purpose above and beyond a hunt for questlines. Scavenging becomes its own motivation and its own reward, and gives all the clutter a purpose for the first time in the series' modern history. Everything has value now, and the heightened difficulty compels you to collect, scrap, and utilise nearly everything you find. It also gives a much-needed sense of immersion to the game, and you feel like a scrappy wasteland wanderer rummaging through garbage to try and rig any contraption that will let you hold your own against the hoards of monsters out to get you. 

That said, be aware of what you're getting into. Bugs are rife, and while I've not experienced many game-breaking ones, the most common bugs are unfathomable from a company as big as Bethesda. Simple WASD glitches, terrible enemy AI, and really, really dogsh*t animations are the most frequent for me, and while the overall experience is good enough to overcome these issues, the fact that they're here at all, let alone 2 years after the game's release while new methods of monetisation are developed and introduced is as savage an indictment of Bethesda's utter rot as a company as anything I could possibly think of.

I don't believe you should give this terrible company your money. But if you're a Fallout fan, I think this game is worth a look.

[b]Too Long; Didn't Read:[/b] It is very easy to decipher if you'll like this game. If you seriously enjoyed a lot of the mechanics and gameplay loop of Fallout 4 like I did, this game will be for you. If you prefer the classic rpgs and scream that New Vegas is the only true Fallout, I doubt you'll enjoy this game, it's a Bethesda open world game, not an mmorpg. And if you like playing games with friends, finding the glitches, or both, it'll be a very ""ok game"" for you, since the multiplayer is only as fun as you make it, and most of the fun glitches are gone, leaving only the annoying bugs.

[h1][b]The Story[/b][/h1]
Fallout 76's story, or lack there of, was made fun of constantly by people like me who hadn't played the game, but had been told there were no npcs or factions. Now that I've played the game, I've discovered that even if you completely ignore the Wastelanders content, there is a story here, and a surprisingly enjoyable one. In the same way Fallout 3 & 4's stories were convoluted in an excuse to get the player to see each major section of the world map, 76's story is better in that it's initial limitation that there were no human npcs actually helps it. 76 is all about the conflict between the human survivors, and their struggle against the scorched. The scorched are one of the new enemy types, a mix between the ghouls and raiders, running at you and hitting you like a ghoul, shooting at you like a raider. Since the bombs didn't land in West Virginia, only around it, there were lots of survivors who all led different groups. The Responders, a group that were basically militarised medical workers, lending their services where they could. The Raiders, just out for caps and killing. The Enclave, looking to take machinery and kill scorched, and the Brotherhood Of Steel who basically did the same. They all died to the scorched beast, [i]an irradiated beast, grown from years of mutation on bats, feared through out all the lan-[/i], they're Skyrim dragons. They're Skyrim dragons, without the cool sound they make when they shoot fire, and they're in a game with machine guns and rocket launchers. But they're contribution to the plot is that they make the Scorched enemies by infecting people with the Scorched plague. That's why all the factions are dead, there is an abundance of Scorched, and why you must complete the work the different factions tried and failed to do, so you may nuke the Scorched Skyrim Dragons base and kill it. The story makes sense, it's works, and is a better excuse for players to run around the map than other games have had.
Before I move onto gameplay, I will say that the presentation of this game is so much better than Fallout 4. The vault suit looks cool now, and comfortable. The guns look shiny and impressive, and with the reintroduction of Fallout 3 guns they have way more variety. And the new enemies look deadly, the old ones having updated textures as well, they all look like horribly mutated monsters.

[h1][b]The Gameplay[/b][/h1]
The gameplay is hard to put into words, or on a page. It's a mixture of improvement to certain aspects, and stupid ideas and mechanics, that all come clashing together. As a player, you have guns you can make, find and improve, but now with the return of weapon condition. This means you should use a variety of weapons, or else you'll have to make a workbench at your camp and spend resources. Stimpaks, Radaways, RadX, etc, they're all here as usual, but working similarly to NV and 3 in that they take awhile to be effective and you can become sickened, immune, addicted by using them. They're also rarer to find which I like, it's better balancing than 4 where they were abundant. Costumes and outfits can now be worn over a vault suit and armour which I really like, but have a sneaking suspicion this was only made to entice the player to buy cosmetics from the atomic store.
Like previous games you have a limited amount of items you can carry, impacted by your strength. This means if you're like me and you like to manage your inventory to carry the most possible, you can easily carry as much as you like and dump the rest into your C.A.M.P, the new mobile version of workshops. This is a problem though, as the Camps have a maximum capacity of 800. This makes no sense to me. Bethesda games are all about exploring, finding loot, and then taking it back to your base and repeating the process.
The levelling and loot in this game also makes no sense. It's hard to tell if it's just broken, inefficient, glitched, or just poor in general. While completing very early game quests at level 7, it's was annoying when for example, I was jumped by a group of ghouls who were all Level 4, and two ghouls in that group were Level 66 for some reason. Or when I was Level 15, searching for a quest item, and all I found were empty containers, and wood armour, which is the earliest game armour you can find. The enemies constantly appearing with out of sync levels confuses me as I was never anywhere near another player or camp, and I played this entire game solo. And the loot not existing, or being lacklustre happened way too often. I'd crack rank 3 safes at the bottom of the map, the most dangerous area, only to find nothing inside, even though I was the first one there. This is why I had so many moments of dry spells, down to 2 stimpaks left, no resources to craft ammo, armour almost broken, and at Level 19, being chased down by a Level 50 Assaultron. I didn't feel like I was always fighting a cold, harsh wasteland. I felt I was losing an arm wrestle to a broken loot system, and it was surrounded by far too powerful enemies. This isn't a constant, sometimes there is loot for your troubles, and for the most part enemies are correctly levelled, but the cracks in the system were far too common.
Camp building works fine, it's the same stuff from Fallout 4 but it looks nicer. Daily quests and events are slightly cool, but are almost always either find an item and bring it back, or fight a swarm of enemies and then press a button. The Wastelanders content is slightly interesting, but the factions are very boring and predictable. This is Fallout 4's quests and factions, stretched out and watered down to it's limit on a larger map. I like Fallout 4's gameplay, but there is only so much I will do on a new map.

[h1][b]Final Score & Comments[/b][/h1]
I'd give Fallout 76 a 6/10. The gameplay is there, and the different stories, now with the added benefit of npcs, helps me stay motivated to uncover the history of the world, and what it means for the future. But the loot and levelling being so awkward, the repetitive nature of the daily and event quests gets tiring, and I feel the new content are tasks I've completed, but with a different coat of paint.

First off, There needs to be a way for new players to be helped more than they currently are, you are basically sent out from the vault without any hints etc or any way to get decent firearms or directions. 

 Secondly, if you are like me, you kinda get bored of this game unless you have people to play it with. One issue being, The game reccomends 'TEAMS' for you to join, however, these teams consist of people **Most of the time** being level 100+ which means you won't do didly squat to any of those enemies. 

This game needs to improve and help new players. So far, I've acomplished really nothing, Trying to get people to play with is a pain in the ass as it is.

Perhaps bethesda will see this and realise what is happening and why not a lot of people enjoy it.

30,Fallout 76,72324551,english,"First you have to buy the game, then you have to pay a monthly fee to get features that were included in Fallout 1, a game that came out 23 years ago (infinite storage space in containers, and not getting your stuff stolen by other players).

The entire thing is buggy and laggy, you'll shoot a guy who won't react for like 1.5 seconds, you'll try to scope in, shoot, scope out to cycle a bolt action, but the game sticks you in the scope for no good reason - a mechanic that worked since Fallout New Vegas is now broken.

Roleplaying is impossible, because there's guys wearing furry costumes doing fortnite dances on all five of the NPCs in the game. Because a dozen people can all be trying to do the same quest at a time, they respawn all the enemies at breakneck pace, ruining your immersion. Playing with friends destroys your illusion of choice: ""oh, I chose to try to negotiate with the bandits, in exchange for a share of the buried treasure they'll leave the bar alone. So I'm heading to the old, abandoned mine."" ""Cool. I just shot him in the face and found a map on his body. Now I'm heading to the old, abandoned mine."" Situations like that make it extremely apparent how little the player's choices matter. Which was always true, just used to be better-hidden.

Playing without pacifist mode on is suicide because the level 1s are running around with level 100s, so there's no chance of interesting interactions with other people. Not that that would solve it, because even with pacifist mode turned on you can still steal from other players, so everyone plays with pacifist on and you still have to deal with griefing anyway.

You'll get quests for miscellaneous things like ""Take this key across the map and use it to open a locker"" but then you do it and not only does the quest never go away, but the locker was empty. Even proper side quests don't go away on completion sometimes, which is either a ""feature"" or a bug.

Oh and cant forget that quiting to main menu waiting a bit and starting the world search is something you will do more times than using a stimpak because all the players you never interact with directly 99.5% of the time (the 0.5% is because you can only sell ammo to players) are also playing the game and loot is on spawn timers so you either wait several hours or you ""server hop"" to hope to get a server where the items you are after are actually there. cherry on the top it can effect quests too so not only do you have to F5 to progress with repairs or construction but you may end up needing to do it to finish a quest.

The main story sucks, but unlike the rest of the series I don't really mind too much, as it's not my focus. Fallout 76 lets me go adventuring with my friends - exploring a huge map for easter eggs, building fun bases and getting drunk and ganging up on Deathclaws. Events are varied enough, the crafting system from Fallout 4 keeps us busy, and there are new beasties to keep it feeling a little bit fresh.

But then the free weekend came and I tried it...only to discover its not just playable, its actually enjoyable. Yes, it has some annoying bugs - worse performance than F4, worse graphics, worse story, but everything else...the amount of content added makes is far superior to F4, the survival mode from New Vegas is back and its harder, new craft-repair mechanics make all your junk actually useful and needed, Wastelanders update added decent quests and so on. Ghouls found at Golf Club wear golf clothes, at Ski Resort - ski clothes...if the ghoul is named ""charred"" - it would look charred, all these little things and details make this game far more immersive I could ever expect. I actually would really love to have stuff from F76 in F4.

99,Fallout 76,72211344,english,"I was one of the long term fans of Fallout 3/NV/4 who initially passed on 76, mostly because of the inexplicable omission of human NPCs. With the Wastelanders expansion, they have finally filled this gaping hole and after playing through the first 33 hours I have to say I'm glad I waited because I can't even imagine how dull this game would have been without them. 

But, if you're thinking of buying Fallout 76, this isn't your main concern, is it? You want to know how multiplayer works and how much it interfers with your gameplay experience. Well, to me the biggest concern so far has not been other players. Maybe I've been lucky, but so far I've only occasionally bumped into other people and apart from a couple of ""wave"" emotes and a nuke dropping at the other end of the map every now and then, they have not been a concern at all. The most jarring thing is the latency every now and then when looting and when sniping targets far away. Playing as a lone wolf this is rarely a gamebreaker but it's there as a constant reminder that this is a watered down Fallout experience. 

Hunger and thirst is mandatory, but food and drink is easy to come by so these are fairly easy to manage. However, storage is limited to a single global ""stash"" container available at your camp as well as some strategic locations in the game world. As someone who usually squirrels away every single type of weapon, armor, clothing, ammo and crafting material, this further forces me to play the game a little different than I did the previous installments. It also means that your capacity to carry things becomes more important, and since skills, perks and attributes are completely different from what we're used to, managing encumbrance is also more difficult. All of this forces you to make hard choices what to keep, what to trade and what to simply leave behind. Ofcourse, this was always the case, but I find it more of a nuisance this time around.

3,Fallout 76,72205104,english,"They took a game that would extend it's like from 60 hours to hundreds even thousands for some with the use of so many amazing mods. Mods that fixed bugs, fixed the horrible inventory UI, added amazing stories and locations, improved upon weather and sounds. Now you can get a mod that makes shit glow so you can totally not 'cheat' in this online game. They took all of those amazing things that made their games so much deeper, and just threw them out. 

The goods:
It's fallout, it's a beautiful world and I want to explore so much of it. As you do you find rewarding stories and interesting events. The world is almost alive around you with events and other people. Most of these people are amazing and fun to play around even if not in a group. Many high levels love to help lower levels out, sometimes with items and sometimes just helping with quests. 
The live events happening all the time can be very fun especially with groups. They keep the world kind of moving and not so stale as the originals become without constantly modding more stuff in. 
Being online is as much an improvement as the primary problem with the game. It can be so fun adventuring with a real life friend as much as strangers in this game. 

The bad:

Now you can spend atoms that you buy with real money or earn few for quests and get all the sweet cosmetics that you used to get with mods. And well that's about all they took from the modding community. Many of the original bugs from 4 are still there, some that were fixed by mods. 

Building is a joke just like it was in 4 without mods that fixed snapping points and allowed many more possibilities. We can't even get a proper half wall or put wallpapers on a window wall without glitching. You can't even choose which way the wall faces as it has to face a certain way on the floor. All of these types of ridiculous bugs were fixed with mods, yet Bethesda can't even incorporate it into a final game.  

Lag, it's so bad when you have built anything near the limit, no matter what monster computer you may have. 

Same garbage inventory UI. Seriously how has it not been improved on? Sure you can still get a mod that renames items so you can at least have stuff sorted properly but seriously the UI is so bad. Then the server lag on top of it makes it 10 times worse. Moving or selling quickly ends badly every time. Random items start to highlight and next thing you know you've transferred or sold 10 of the wrong things. 

Same lag majorly affects crafting. Jumping around highlighted items, crafting the same thing multiple times but not actually crafting anything as it has yet to realize you've run out of that ingredient. 

Trying to repair items is a chore, why does it take like 5 button presses? It's one of the most common things you will do, and it's buried. 

Limited stash space means you will not only be dealing with the chore of managing it on a frequent basis, but you will leaving quest rewards and so many items to waste. Missiles, nope toss em, most weapons, unless you are really close to a crafting bench you can scrap them you wont pick them up. Even if you can scrap them, unless you pay for fallout 1st you will be tossing/selling materials nonstop for you will have no room for any of it. Especially until you get past level 50 and have max level guns you will be out of crafting materials nonstop. So on comes the grind.

The grind... Sure you don't have to. But you will. Especially after the recent update. As with many games with grinds they make it so it's more difficult then just spending money. Tired of hunting down materials for repairs, just buy some repair kits. Tired of grinding for these new ranks, pay atoms to level your ranks soon. 

No respecing, so if you want to make  certain build you better hope luck of the draw is on your side and you get the cards you want otherwise you're waiting many more levels before you can get the cards you need. Or if you already were level 20 and decide you want to play way different, sure you can swap cards, but only if you unlocked them, or make a new character and start over. 


TLDR: Forced online play and microtransaction greed have basically ruined an amazing franchise. It's amazing to play with friends, while the online servers create real limitations that severely dampen the potential every fallout game has had. While the greed has created many artificial limitations in hope to get that sweet sweet microtransaction fountain of youth money.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bethesda's first crack at an MMO has been a very rocky road.

Get it on sale, but just know ahead of time that you have a limited(800 weight) stash without paying for a subscription; as others' reviews probably pointed out.

You can earn atoms by playing daily/weekly/monthly and doing the challenges, so you can earn the cool and useful things in the store; plus the store has something free every day.

It can be buggy, in true Fallout fashion, with added possible network problems.
Which, I assume, might be solvable with the subscription; as it allows private servers.
I don't know, as I've not tried it. (Somewhat confirmed, though I assume you still can't play if the servers go down.)

A lot of people complain that they added a subscription, but I'm trying to be a bit more open to the idea.
If it improves the quality of things and also adds to the quantity, then I don't see the issue.

28,Fallout 76,72177296,english,"I didn't play this game until Wastelanders was added so I can't compare it to how the game used to be. But the bad reviews kept me away since release. Adding Wastelanders and adding the game to Steam was definitely a huge step in the right direction and now I have some faith in the dev team for this game. The season system they just came out with has some super cool rewards and is much better than the traditional challenge system. 

I have been basically no-lifing this game for the past 2 months. I can't get enough of it. The map is huge and while locations aren't super dense there is still tons to explore. Although the lack of Vaults to explore is a disappointment. The lore in locations, most notably military installations (my favorite places to explore) is dry and not the super immersive stories like Fallout 3. The scenery, cool locations, and photo mode are enough to distract me though. 

Character customization is nice and collecting outfits for my different photos in different locations is one of my favorite things about the game. The in-game store always has some cool stuff to add to your house or your character. And there is no pressure to buy anything. However, the paid subscription benefits kinda force you into subscribing if you're gonna put alot of time into the game. The Survival Tent is a game changer as you can drop it down and dump your loot in it. I know alot of you will wish there was a free alternative. Also the private server you get for subscribing is super nice. Yea it still requires internet (we'll get into why that's an issue in a bit) but it allows you to explore by yourself in a traditional Fallout way. 

Now that they've added quite a ton of stuff to the game it's definitely fun and will keep my interest for a long while. However, the biggest issue remains: Online only. Not the concept or the gameplay, the server stability. Countless times I've been an hour deep into exploring a location and get booted back to the main menu. I play solo, I don't need the server. Terminals are connected to the server in some weird way where if you back out and try to hack it again too quickly the server stops responding. That's my number 1 complaint. I enjoy the game, I enjoy the visuals and customization. I sort of enjoy the character build system. I really enjoy my massive nice house I built on a river bank.

I believe it's the Wastelanders-update, which brought the NPCs in to the game, that really unlocked the potential of a classic Fallout narrative. Missions without NPCs are better because of it. I won't spoil anything, because this review would turn into an essay if I did.
In 24 (current) hours I encountered about 5 bugs, of which 1 required a restart. When considering Bethesda and the Creation Engine, in my mind this is an absolute win.

For the aforementioned price, and time already spent, it's definitely a recommendation from me, because it has too much value to be overlooked for its issues, even if the super-mutants of the internet are still debating the endgame multiplayer mechanics. I love immersing in stuff like this and figuring stuff out on my own. I'm still semi-early into the story and a n00b in multiplayer, so I don't have any formulated opinions, but the value is there.

I`ve started with Fallout 4, and didnt play the older games, but still, I have many hours on FO4 and I enjoyed it alot. I love the theme, I love the action, VATS, hording loot, base building, story,.... Really, I love many things about the game and the fact that it`s very diverse. There are complete sessions that all I did was base building.
Onwards to Fallout 76 ...  man,.... this could have been a dream come true. A World of worcraft style game in the FO universe where you could show your base to people you meet and go on raids together. 
Part of that dream came true and there are many things that ARE amazing, that`s why I currenly have around 150 hours in the game. There are also things that could improved but I wont go into all of those. I just want to mention one thing - THE BUGS.
Mind you, I`m writing this in June 2020, so that`s two years that the developers had to fix the game but man o man ..... Never in my life have I see a big game company put out a game that is so riddled with bugs. It`s not even funny sometimes. Almost every session I play I run into a new issue, just ridicules and honestly embarrassing. A game this big, a franchise this big with soooooooo many bugs is simply sad.
And that is why I took the time (for the first time ever) to write a review here on steam and give it a thumbs down.

EDIT: 
So I now played a total of roughly 230 hours. Oh, and I also bought Fallout 1st, because honestly, without it, inventory management takes up 50% of your game time and is pure frustration.

I just now took the decision to cancel my subscription and uninstall the game. 
At this point I`m level 77 and there is zero challange or interest. Getting that super perfect legendary weapon or armor has become the main target of the game. The events are redicules. 20 players with maxxed out armor and super legendary weapons/perks/mutations shoot at several very weak enemies. Battles are over in a couple of seconds, everyone collects the loot and fast travels to the next location. .... Fun ? Nope. Not anymore. 
Walking around the wasteland and enjoying the atmosphere is what we enjoyed in the previous titles. This does not happen here. I dont know if it`s the multiplayer or something else, but something is not working.

Hackers seem to mostly be gone from the game at this point, and whatever exploits that existed at the time seem to have been hammered out by the time the game came out on steam. Mostly. 

The changes of lore are irritating, but at this point what can any of us do. 

Atleast it is better then fallout BOS

65,Fallout 76,72119630,english,"As an early review, this game is pretty fun. The graphics are obviously great, gameplay is really good (apart from a few bugs), and Bethesda really did improve it with Wastelanders. There are a few errors I'm having while connecting to servers, but that only rarely happens. The fetch quests are kind of boring, especially the wayward one, but we all went through the Fo4 Minutemen quests, so they're probably doable. The one thing that is especially bothering me is that there is no cross-platform. There isn't even a need for it, there is nearly no PvP in the game (apart from nuclear winter) and the multiplayer system is just for enjoyment and co-operation.

Overall, I think they made a good job improving the game, and it definitely deserves a try.

PS: I haven't complained about 'Fallout 1st' or 'Atoms' since they are not essential to play. If you're rich, go for it. If you can't afford it or don't want to buy it, then don't.

Wastelanders and a sale made me jump in. Boy it is a mixed ride. 

The good:
- The game itself have many good ideas. 
- The addition of npcs helps a lot. 
- Some fun quests and new tidbits of lore. 
- Great world map. 
- Decent story.
- New public grouping system

The bad and very ugly:
- The game is a house built on clay. Every session I play I find more cracks have appeared in it. 
- Freezes, crashes, disconnects a plenty. 
- Broken quests making me relog and lose hours of progress. 
- Bugs that are never fixed. 
- Endgame is a huge grind without meaning. 
- Game affecting pay for huge convenience scheme that is Fallout first. (Really obnoxius!) 
- They have now removed the daily atoms earning and replaced it with seasons, cleverly designed to make you spend real money on atoms, the ingame currency for cosmetics. 
- Daily challenges fail to reset if you are logged in. 
- Everything in the game is locked behind timegates. Theres a limit to how much reputation you can gain, how much money you can earn etc. daily. And they are really tiny.
- 2 years after launch people are still running around with illegal modded weapons. I saw a mingun fatman the day i wrote this, never seen that before.

I give it a positive since I have had a my bit of enjoyment out of it but fair warning. Most of what you have heard about the game is true...

This game is honestly worth close to 20 dollars to compensate for micro transactions, so get it while on sale or that price range. 

It is grindy, and expect your immersion to be shit on by someone who thinks it's absolutely hilarious to probably named in the vein of ""xxxnoob3rsxxx"" who isn't that bad of a person but just happened to one shot an event boss and cleared out an area that was full of life 5mins ago. 

This is a solid 7/10 game with way more content than it deserves, it feels like a single player game modded for multiplayer. I'd recommend it on sale for 20 dollars, not a penny more. If you get it for that price, hop in and go for a ride and don't expect too much. This is bethesda cash-grabbing and mediocrity at their finest, but it will definitely scratch your Fallout itch.

I originally played this game on release back on Xbox, and my god, I put it down within 20 minutes and never played it again. That is until now.

I heard rumors and have seen some mentions that this game has improved massively over the past few years so I decided to take a dive in to it again whilst its on sale and I don't regret it at all. 

I may have only been playing for 9 hours so far, but I literally played 9 hours straight since I loaded the game up and unlike its launch, the addition of NPC's has made this game playable and exciting again, there feels like an abundance to do, and the community seems to be more inviting then previously, where as soon as I would see someone, I would be shot at.

I've encountered a few bugs, but nothing game breaking in my opinion.

It may have taken a few years, but if you were like me and sitting on the fence about buying this game, do it, I know that this game will bring me hours of fun for the next few month at least, and with the addition of The legendary Run (Which is essentially a free battle pass) the game now has even more to offer, from events, to story lines, to side quests, I think Bethesda have finally made something which isn't a on going joke anymore.",1593821954,1593904298,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,155,3,3669,0,560,1595273763

18,Fallout 76,72037104,english,"I cannot vouch for this games launch, but have to believe all of the reviews that this game, to put it lightly, was launched as an unfinished game. Not to put anyone on blast, but after reading a Steam review where the guy said he had played this game from launch and, in short, recommended the game now (Unlike he did on launch) I decided to buy the deluxe edition on sale for $35 via his review recommendation.  As someone that has played the Fallout series since Fallout 3 launched on PC, I have to say that this is a very fun and solid Fallout game. Its better than Fallout 4 for sure. And the greatest part about this game is that Bethesda is still working in it, they aren't done with it. The online community has been cool thus far. I thought I was going to be killed by a couple of high-levels like playing HC on Diablo 2 online mode back in the day(You all remember that crap? Ugh) but instead of killing me, they kinda crept around and saved my life from being overrun and then went off on their way. The quests are not as story driven as Fallout 4, but have more of a New Vegas touch to it (and as we all know, New Vegas was BAE). Though Fallout is meant to be very lonely, Bethesda answered when we all wanted it online to play with others and this is exactly that: Fallout Online.  The music is amazing btw and really captures the essence of the series. My only complaint so far is that the graphics aren't that good-- Which I don't mind usually because I'd sacrifice graphics for a great game like New Vegas any day-- But the graphics will sometimes get bad during a gun fight with a mutant or ghoul and you won't be able to see them because they didn't render correctly and, well, you get killed by a lvl 3 monster when your a lvl 7 on that alone lol but aside from that, great game so far!

     As with all Fallout games this one will take hundreds of hours to really get to know and to complete.  I've brought the Fallout 1st pack so that I can play the game mainly as a Standalone.  I've played Black Desert and other online games, however Fallout, for myself, is more of an individual experience.  The one thing I can say straight off... is that I miss my dog! 
     Building your character is ENTIRELY different.  My advice is to use the Builder Planner on the fallout site and map out your build right from the get go.  I restarted after level 7 when I realized that I was making a mess of my build without said plan.
     The story lines added are truly up to par with past Fallout games.  I find it more like Las Vegas and Fallout 3 in that regard though the controls are more in line with Fallout 4.  I very much like that when your in a town to achieve a certain goal that a ""challenge"" will appear (e.g. turn on all the jukeboxes in Summerville).  It gives the game that full Fallout experience of the little misc. side quests popping up that often turn out to be either just fun or down right interesting.
    All in all I'm having a great time with the game and looking forward to many more hours exploring and building my character.  Given I'm at level 14 and need 56 to finish my characters planned build... well I've got my work cut out for me.  Of course after that I'll probably come back and try a different build... maybe power armor next time around instead of my stealth sniper build that has served me so well in the past.",1593801709,1593801709,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,171,13,16949,0,2202,1598378328

Nothing compares to this game! 

Ive been a fan of the Fallout series since Fallout 3. Thanks to a recommendation from a friend. The next thing I know I'm absorbed into the world of Fallout and can't stop. 
I've had the opportunity to play New Vegas, and Fallout 4. (Fallout 76 being my favorite so far over 400hrs)

This is my first review of any game I've purchased on Steam. I enjoy it so much I want others to enjoy it too. What stands out most for me is the freedom bethesda gives its players in Fallout 76(Fallout games in general). You can explore solo or with a party. You can do quest or ignore them all together. You can do co op or pvp(Nuclear Winter) . You can scrounge for resources or you can buy them by trading other players with in game currency. You can build a base or not. You can craft your own unique weapons and armor with your own name. You can open your own shops. You can tame creatures. You can buy items with atoms from the shop without spending money. You can lauch a nuke! 

Before I continue on a tangent about all the things you can do in this game I'll say this... Its just an awesome game that's not perfect like anything else... 

When I first purchased this game on the Xbox one I was intrigued to see how the  online addition would be for Fallout. I played a bit and thought, is this some kind of joke? Like I mentioned Ive been playing Fallout since Fallout 3. I was already used to certain gameplay mechanics and features that in my opinion were great. However it seemed as if bethesda forgot about what made the previous Fallout games amazing. The story and NPCs. Yes I was used to interacting with well thought out characters and companions that made me want to delve deeper and learn more about them. And it was so awesome having companions watch my back in combat. Well....that was all removed from Fallout 76 for some reason???

Thankfully I assume due to popular demand, NPC's were introduced into Fallout 76 with the (Free) Wastelanders DLC. OK yes this should have been in the game at launch, but the fact that they did add it is cool right? If they didn't I wouldn't be writing this review....

Pros: 

-Multiplayer Co op pve or pvp
-Freedom to explore. Your not 
forced to do anything in order to progress. 
-Gameplay
-Leveling system and perks= awsomeness
-Combat with VATS is unlike anything else. 100% unique any game aout there
-Base building
-Little to no griefing. In adventure mode players can't spawn kill you and take your equipped items, steal from your Stash or destroy your Camp thankfully. Pve/ Co op overall is what I love. 
-Character class development 
-Weapon and Armor customization
-Variety of enemies and NPCs
-Nuclear Launches
-Controller support 
-Graphics
-Community. Other players are so kind and helpful . One player gave me a level 50 bloodied fixer. I couldn't believe it. It's the only weapon I use now with my rifle build. 


Cons:

-Stash limit. There's too much good stuff... The scrap box helps but my stash is always full! It's a hassle to get rid of stuff I want or need just for stash space. Please understand. 
-No vehicles or mounts. Imagine taming a Scorchbeast and being able to fly on it!!! Or gathering resources to fix up an old world car and drive it throughout the wastes!
-Companions don't follow you like in previous Fallout games. It would be awesome if your companions could follow you until you join a team with other players or something. Also why is it so difficult to tame creatures? There's no instructions? Maybe the overseer should teach me how since she's so knowledgeable...
-So many features but too little instructions. I find myself turning to YouTube for tutorials on how to do basic things like how to add a resource extractor to you base or where to find the resource deposits. 

Conclusion:

Thanks Bethesda for adding multiplayer to the Fallout series. I think you all did an excellent job.
This game is my favorite in 2020.
I've tried so many games over the years and open world, CO-OP/ PVE is my style. This game puts them together gracefully. 
 It would be nice if some of my suggestions get implemented. Others might agree. (Stash limit? companions follow you around the world and fight with you/ instructions on how to tame and mount Scorchbeast or craft cars 😁) Just keep the updates and fixes coming and you'll keep the player base thriving.",1593798617,1593798617,TRUE,0,1,0,1,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,42,2,35391,1124,24018,1601693189

*IMPORTANT*
So, first off, if you're buying this game, please note that the ""Create Account"" feature within the game doesn't work at all so save yourself some trouble and go create the account on their website after you've bought the game. Then, once you've done that, restart the game. Took me a while before I figured those things out. This still held true a few weeks ago when a friend of mine tried to start the game.

Pros
+I enjoy exploring and discovering things and this game is great from that perspective. 
+ The voice acting is amazing.
+ Huge map to discover
+ A lot of different ways to build your character
+ A lot of different weapon types as well as variants within that weapon type
+ You have to eat and drink (not everyone enjoy this) and there are plenty of recipes
+ Controls are easy to learn
+ A lot of different events (also known as public quests) that happen randomly all across the map
+ You can build your own little base.
+ If you're in a party you get various bonuses
+ A lot of different skills to choose between as you level up
+ Appalachia Radio!

Negative things
- Certain things need a quality of life update. For example, crafting multiple things like ammo, food etc can be tedious.
- Character development past level 50 gets less interesting because only way to improve it is to gain better equipment. You will still learn new skills but since you can only equip X amount of skill cards it's more of allowing you to change play style (or fix certain unnecessary early game picks) rather than to improve the character.
- Storage space. Unless you're a subscriber, you can only stash 800lb (think they use lb in this game) of weight in your base.
- Currency cap. There's a max cap for how many caps you can have (currently 30k).
- Vendor daily caps cap. All vendors share the same caps, meaning you can only earn a max of 1400 caps per day by selling to vendor. If you buy an item from a vendor, a % of your cap spent will however return to that cap pool. Don't buy stuff if the vendors are full of caps, sell something first.
- If you really want to dominate then there are easy ways to do so by forgoing a majority of the skills in favor of a certain few combined with specific weapon. It's not too hard to achieve once you learn how to google and will take you from struggling with a group of ghouls to annihilating end game bosses single handed. Making the vast majority of skills redundant.
- Depending on the location, it can be quite common for attacking NPCs to get distracted and wander off when defending workshops which is bad because you got to kill all the attackers. Some attacking NPcs sometimes gets stuck under ground (looking at you Mr Mole Rat).
- Weight. As a new player you will be encumbered all the time. This will hold true late game as well because you will be forced to choose between carrying things and doing dmg/survive.",1593793373,1593793373,TRUE,1,0,0.516129076,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,324,27,39375,2413,19428,1602012546

65,Fallout 76,71946936,english,"Fallout 76 is an odd duck. We all have seen, and heard the reputation the game has rightfully earned since a disasterous launch over a year ago. A launch so bad, due in part to the fact Bethesda didn't expect Fallout fans to want Fallout in their Fallout game, rather than just doing standard PVP stuff within a post apocolyptic backdrop.

In an attempt to salvage the flaming dumpster Bethesda overhauled the game with the introduction of NPC characters, skill checks, and new quest lines. Is it enough? In my opinion yes, but with the caveat that you have to be a fan of the franchise.

I originally played the beta of the game pre-launch on the PS4. At the time the game had clipping issues, enemies who just stand in place while you shoot them, T-posed enemies, and a vast host of other bugs and glitches. Since grabbing the Steam version and playing for roughly 51 hours as of the time of this writing I have shockingly run into very few bugs.

I had an escort mission where the Mr. Handy I was following seemingly vanished after a fight, but that could be hand waved away as him just going a direction I could spot him in. I've had a few minor instances where an enemy seems stuck in the floor and you can't hit him or vice versa - but honestly this is a common problem for almost any MMO styled game. For the most part the game has run reasonably well and I've not run into any issues.

There is HOWEVER one major issue I have run into. On rare instances (this has happened twice in 51 hours) you will enter a terminal only to discover your inputs are no longer working and you can't back out of the terminal forcing you to force close the game via task manager and reopen it.

Still, this has happened so seldomly that I can't completely bury the game for it. The gunplay is about the same as you'll find in Fallout 4, with the downside of VATS now attempts to function in real time via slowing down time ... which doesn't work because it's happening in real time so basically your targeting chance goes from 95% to 0% in a split second and it's generally more of a hassle than it's worth to bother with. It is, however, effective for spying enemies from a large distance to make you aware they exist.

If you like the Fallout series, with a primary focus on the Bethesda era games chances are you'll probably enjoy this now that we have quests, factions, and all the like added. It's not as elaborate as the big brother single player games but if you can get the game cheap enough you'll have fun. If the Fallout series does nothing for you, then I'm not sure this game is going to change that.

So I recommend the game, but I do so with the caveat that perhaps it's best to wait for a good sale.",1593780413,1593780413,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,660,29,5712,171,3092,1601388267

Much like other Bethesda titles, this felt like a rushed title just to feed the fanbase with some content. As a fact, it brings nothing more than a new map to explore, few NPCs and mutated creatures; the rest is basically Fallout 4 assets ported into a new game. Before Wastelanders, there were almost no other characters at all, no story, no interesting stuff to do. Thankfully, Bethesda has decided to put some more ingredients into a pot.

THE GOOD STUFF

- Massive, varied world to explore alone or with other people
- Several new mutants to fight
- C.A.M.P. system to place your small settlement almost anywhere
- Interesting quests
- Daily and weekly objectives to complete
- Mildly satisfying reward system
- Random events
- Many cosmetic items to wear/build
- The soundtrack, as always

THE BAD STUFF
- Weird AI glitching into walls or not moving
- Hackers. Pray that you never meet a player with a minigun firing nukes.
- Uninspired story
- Some bugged quests
- Very grindy, tends to push people to buy currencies with real money
- Nothing really ""new"", it's Fallout 4 assets ported into another game.
- Monthly subscription (really dude?)


Despite having its flaws and not being truly innovative, I'm enjoying this game. I suggest getting it on sale, though. In it's current state, it's not worth the full price. Also, avoid the monthly fee, since it won't give you any true benefit apart from Atoms to buy cosmetics; some people are also having trouble deactivating the subscription.

However I don't mind grindy games and the base mechanics of the game are enjoyable enough to hope they will iron this game out. Considering most of the bugs/annoying mechanics aren't present in FO4 I'm pretty sure they were added to arbitrarily extend the game time I doubt it. 

But I expect to get atleast 80 hours of playtime and only paid $25 while on sale I can't complain

Review at 12 hours:

Tl;Dr - Decided to give controversial game a chance, surprise, it is pissing me off within the first few hours of playing and is likely unplayable for alot of people for the time being

Some guy was roleplaying a doomsday prophet when I exited the Vault for the first time ever. Cool, but his booming wannabe youtuber voice is irritating and preventing me from hearing the first real quest dialogue. Oh well, it's an mmorpg with voip afterall so I expect some annoyances from time to time. After a few minutes figure out how to get to social screen, find the guy and mute him. This was within my first hour. I am now 12 hours in and about 40 hours have passed since first playing. I HAVE NOT HEARD A SINGLE OTHER PLAYER SINCE.

I finally realised it was way to quiet for it just to be shy players, now noticing every player in recent is showing red circle with a line that signals something is turned off so I tweet at Bethesda support mentioning my issue. There reply was to link me to an article that didn't apply to my issue at all (something about adding friends) and suggests setting up port forwarding on your router. 

Game function was working. I used a game function as intended. Bethesda support recommends the issue is on my end where they will not offer any support",1593363103,1593720692,TRUE,0,0,0.501618087,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,43,2,6740,8,761,1600905846

94,Fallout 76,71899452,english,"I'll preface this review by saying that I was super apprehensive about this game when it was first released. It seemed to stray too far from the formula of previous installments in the series. 

I've always been a bit skittish about MMO/battle royal games to begin with just because the community element has always seemed intimidating. Conversely, survival games have peaked my interest, in particular, PVE co-op survival.

That said, Fallout 76 has really won me over. The dynamic elements are pretty much a carbon copy of fallout 4. Walking, running, shooting, digging for tin cans in piles of rubble, all this should feel very familiar to players (with some marginal differences with the functionality of VATS).

It's also a darned pretty game too. My machine can't handle maxed settings, but it runs well on medium while maintaining a significant amount of polish. The environments feel very organic and look ripe for exploration. Being a real life resident of the Appalachian region of Virginia, I approve.

I don't have any experience playing fallout 76 prior to the wastelands update, so I I can't speak to the improvements it made, but the addition of NPCs does breathe a little more life into the ruins of Appalachia. These characters will provide occasional quests or opportunities to trade, but ultimately they feel kinda two dimensional, and this factor ended up my biggest gripe with the game overall. There's still a lot of content, and the daily challenges give you plenty of reasons to spend some time in the wasteland, but the story just isn't up to par with previous games.

Server stability is excellent (even with my pitiful rural internet connection) and crashes are infrequent and less than devastating. Some bugs exist; enemies falling through the terrain, random damage sounds, etc, but nothing significant or particularly new to players of previous Fallouts.

Scavenging, crafting and camp building are all very satisfying, and require the perfect amount of grinding. Also, searching for the perfect place to set up shop is definitely a  blast.

My biggest apprehension (the community element) turned out to be one of my strongest praises of Fallout 76. Never once have I been antagonized by another player or witnessed such a thing towards others. In fact, more than once, I've been gifted high level loot from strangers who I'd never met before, and haven't seen since. Nothing will give you the warm and fuzzies quite like reciving a legendary shotgun from a stranger and then being able to pass that same weapon on to a newbie further down the road. Of course PVP is still an option for mutually consenting players if that's your thing, but the co-op is on point.

I really can't say enough good things about Fallout 76. It's just plain fun to play. 

I hopefully this is helpful and I didn't ramble too much. Maybe I'll see you out there, in the ruins of the old world.

95,Fallout 76,71899130,english,"Even if the graphics were not causing me frequent headaches, I would still have requested a refund. I have played the game for less then a week and already hate it. Bethesda seems to be more inclined to create the perfect annoying atmosphere rather then to design something enjoyable. You start off right away with having to spend large amounts of time just looking for ingredients for food and drink, which only lasts maybe 10 minutes on a full bar before the game wants more again. Then you take radiation damage for eating and drinking, which leads to needing cures. And all of this crap needs to be carried in your very limited inventory as weight, and if your not working up a strength build, will start to overload you quick. 

I found it very difficult to get into the meat of the game while constantly being harassed by incumbured, unsatiated, radiated and generally just bogged down by endless ""realism"" that just ruins what Im really there for, to quest, kill stuff and have fun. Not much enjoyment having to CONSTANTLY stop and scrounge for ingredients so I can be overweight, then cant carry my important loot. Yes you can get some perks to help with this, but then you take up vital perk spots for important things such as combat or questing. 

To wrap it in a nutshell, its a game of headaches, literally and figurativly, to be honest, its no wonder this game tanked right out of the gate.",1593717051,1593717051,FALSE,3,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,7,1,1370,0,1349,1600465596

I bought this at the Steam Summer Sale for 50% off so if others are considering taking up the discount I thought I'd cover it. (ends 9th July)
Well the first piece of advice if you want to play this game is TURN OFF THE MUSIC! It's so depressing that you'll want to kill yourself after 30 mins, so turn it right down and play something you like in the background. Now that thats done you can finally enjoy the game. I wasn't too sure about this title as I've heard mixed reviews but so far I'm starting to feel like I'm playing a fallout game which is what I wanted so I'm happy. It has all the mystery, exploration, surprises, encounters, and action you'd expect from a normal Fallout game with public missions thrown in. The new Borderlands DLC came out today but I'm happy enough to keep playing this for a while first so lets face it, it's won over me. Take a look.

5,Fallout 76,69072851,english,"Definitely a big improvement from their beta phase. 
There are daily quests to do, nuclear missiles to launch and a whole lot of stuff to turn your C.A.M.P into a small private settlement. I personally like to build C.A.M.P s.  

Main quests can be completed fairly quickly if you are focused and may probably take less than a week.

The game still have frequent bugs and storage space has always been a complaint for most players.

You are given an option to subscribe to their fallout 1st members that will give you an unlimited junk storage but not unlimited storage for other things like weapons and armour. 

Still not much incentive or reason to PVP in the adventure mode. No faction wars or anything of that nature.

But for people who enjoy PVP they also have nuclear winter which is a PVP battle royale / PUBG type of mode. The character you created for adventure mode will be able to gain exp while you play in nuclear winter and also uses your S.P.E.C.I.A.L system and perks points to modify your nuclear winter builds with the various nuclear winter perk cards.

Hope to see more new content in regards to C.A.M.P building, more quests and most 
importantly storage space.

The recent July 2020 update:

8,Fallout 76,69309314,english,"Don't buy this. I don't care if it's on sale, I don't care what you read online, just don't fucking do it. Even at 90% off. Compared to money, time is a much more precious and limited commodity, and this joke of a game isn't worth any of yours.

1. Hacked weapons. Stuff like an MIRV Minigun or a Beam Splitter Handmade will shred through anything and Bethesda won't do anything about it. If you ever die within several shots in PvP, see the Scorchbeast Queen get killed as soon as it appears, or crash because of several hundred explosions happening all at once - now you know the reason why.

2. It is still, a very, very buggy and unpolished game. Bugs ported from Fallout 4, questionable optimization, crashes, horrible UI, lack of a proper trading system, perks, attachments, and legendary effects not working as intended, dysfunctional economy.

3. Nonexistant gamebalancing. Imagine this: Compared to a normal player, you deal several times the damage, have all the SPECIAL stats at 25, have a 45% to avoid all damage, and regenerate ALL of your health at crazy rates several seconds after being hit. The only downside? Your health is capped at 20%. That's the Bloodied build in a nutshell. Additionally, the game is dirt easy even without using Bloodied. At higher levels, there are only two enemies that will be of any threat to you: Assaultrons and Mister Gutsies. With everything else (yes, even the Scorchbeasts and Deathclaws) you might as well use a level 5 weapon and do just fine.

3. Limits on anything and everything. 30k caps limit, 1000 scrip limit, 800 stash limit. You also cannot turn in more then 150 scrip and 1200 caps per day. And when you cannot turn something in, it will eat up your stash/inventory space. A good chunk of your stash will be occupied by junk, which you're gonna have to micromanage on an hourly basis. Or pay for Fallout 1st for scrapbox access, effectively making all your junk weightless. Create a problem, sell the solution. Bethesda moment.

4. Wastelanders does not justify the game's purchase in the slightest. If you were have access to all the fast travel locations and have good equipment, you can speedrun the entire main story in an hour if not less. The endgame grind that comes with it is downright boring, uninspiring, uncreative, and degrading even when compared to Fallout 4 repeatable quests.

5. With the introduction of seasons, the amount of atoms you can earn in 3 months is being lowered from 6500 to 1500, with Bethesda thinking shit-tier predetermined skins will make up for those 5000.

I have sunk 200+ hours into this. The game gets progressively less fun the more you play it. It won't end up the same way as No Man's Sky did - this is Bethesda we're talking about. Please, for the love of God, spend your money elsewhere.",1589725281,1593680716,FALSE,1,1,0.444444418,1,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,197,8,18941,0,16246,1600348125
9,Fallout 76,71859293,english,"At the first thought of Fallout 76 being called ""The worst game in history"" and ""The biggest hype to flop"" I tried to Stay Away from the game, but once Wastelands came out I got the game in mainly a ""Fuck it"" kind of appeal, just to say I've played All Fallout games, and be happy with myself, I've Come to Love this game even though I've only played 8 hours, It may seem slow and bleak to other players, But that's what i love about it, the bleakness and Vastness of the wasteland makes me feel as if it's actually where an apocalyptic event happened and it's not sprawling with people everywhere. Even though the settler content, does add some people, I don't see it as a problem, they didn't add to many people for it to be overwhelming and it still feels like a slow game play type of game alone and a blast with friends. Now that I'm done ranting to what i enjoy, lets get onto what i hate. One, the level requirement system, yes i see why it would be needed, so OP players cannot just buff up smaller players really fast, but I think a system of weapons gradually get better based on your level (whether they are on you or not) so if u start off with the weakest pistol, it doesn't just stay at the same damage unless u get perks for it, I don't see the difference between a level 1 hunting rifle and a level 5 one, yet you have to change all your attachments on one to even try to use the other by wasting components. So I believe it should be added as a thing that weapons don't have level requirements, but progressively get better either the more you use it, or the higher level you get. Two, why can you wear power armor frames and not the power armor? Like you can wear the frame, but not the armor? WTF. So I think the armor should be leveled the same as weapons as I described earlier, they progressively get better by leveling up, and the more a player uses it the better they are with it. Yes, there are some flaws with that, some people could just stick with one set of armor for the entire game, yeah but i think it should come down to the more you have to repair it, the faster it breaks, and gets slowly worse, and then finally is unfix able and can no longer be used. Another way to combat someone using the same armor for the entire game, is that each armor, has a max Defense rating it can get, no matter the player, so they have to go out and find a better armor to wear, and as for weapons the same system, each weapon can only do so much damage no matter the player, because a weapon can only be so good. Three, weird lighting bugs on my GPU, all weapons are shiny, and not like a normal amount, Immensely shiny, enough to drop my fps Substantially. If you read this completely, Thank You!!!

""DISCLAMER""

Yes all of the things Bethesda did in the past how they treat customers sometimes is atrotious. And yes Fallout is not a polished Triple A game. 

What i want to say with that is that im not focusing on things that are already obvious im not going to moan about stuff that has already been out there those are not the topics i want to talk about, because i simply dont care about it. I want to state my own and personal opinion towards ""THE GAME"". Im capslocking this so nobody is going to comment why i didnt say how Bethesda is this and that.

That out of the way let me tell you something about my personal and honest opinion after about 16 hours of gameplay which sure isnt a lot but i think after 16 hours i can say some things about the game.


REVIEW ITSELF:

1. Small History

-When i saw Fallout 76 releasing in that state with all of the people on youtube stating that it does have a lot of flaws i didnt really want to play the game at all, because i didnt want to spend 60 bucks on it and experience bugs and glitches. 

-When Wastelanders came out i started to get interessted in this game again and started to watch some people experiecing it and telling their opinions (which im not applying to myself 100%). Most of the things ive heard were really positive. A lot of people were saying that it goes in the right direction. 

-So my interest at this point was definetly there and i was just waiting for the steam summer sale to get my hands on it because its that much cheaper. I thought to myself oh well lets just test it out i can just refund it if its really bad.

2. My first hours 

When i first loaded into the game and got out of the Vault my expectations were not really high to be honest and i hoped for at least some good stuff. But surprisingly i actually liked what i saw. Like sure no doubt the graphics are not 2019 standart even for a Fallout game and the engine sucks too xD. But still it just felt so oldschool and it gave me some Fallout 3,4 vibes really. After encoutering the first Npcs i actually liked the choices i was given and the dialogue wasnt as bad as i expected it to be actually some of the answers were entertaining. 

And at this point i started my first Wastelander quest. I was just randomly walking around the Waywatch Bar when suddenly 2 guys approached me and and offered me a trade it was like what is going on here am i getting like baited or scammed or something. But those guys just dropped guns, loot, armor and supplies and i was like 2 woah did that really happen are there still people not toxic and trolling like in most games. And i was really surprised by that that there are still communities and people that actually help new players and that want to have a cool conversation with you. It was a long time ago when i saw this kind of help from others. Most of the time you get insulted, trolled on, or backseated upon how can you do this and that you do everything wrong. But this already was a really pleasant surprise.

And so i kept playing and playing and i just couldnt stop playing this game i dont know why. This game just hooked me for some reason. (Btw i mean the last 3 days ofc). 
I was discovering nice areas, structures, missions, npcs it just felt really good and didnt become stale of boring because the map is soooo huge and there are a ton of structures and areas (biomes) that you can explore and loot. The C.A.M.P system was also working perfectly for me and i already have a small base. But thats nothing in comparison to the absolute skyscrapers and giga bases ive seen around the world some peoples bases were just completly rediculous in a good sense.

And so im here after 16 hours still enjoying the game and having a blast exploring, looting and talking to npcs


3. Technical state of the game:

To be completly honest after 16 hours of gameplay i had 0 bugs and im not lying this is completly crazy either im REALLY lucky or i dont know. But it was crazy that ive not encountered any major bug. Like ofc lets not forget there are still tons of small bugs like enemies in walls and your character glitching a bit into structures etc. But ive never gotten a single game breaking bug which is shocking and great at the same time. The only thing i had was a disconnect from the server once. 

Interms of Fps ye its not running REALLY good. But its still working fine for me. I get around 130 Fps in small towns and open areas. In towns and near large structures it drops to like 70-80 fps. Those results by the way were with all maxed graphics. 

But ye i dont have a particularly bad pc setup. 
- RTX 2070 Super 
- i7 8700k 
- 16bg Ram

So ye i do have a good pc. But for a bethesda game running at 130 fps most of the times that really great and im totally fine and happy with that. 
(I mean some games run better with A LOT better graphics but thats just Bethesda games nothin you can do about that fact its sad ye but whatever)

So to cunclude the technical state of the game yes its definetly clunky and and it does have issues. BUT and here comes the big but (no pun intended) for a Fallout 76 which was absolutely atriotious when it came out to this state it is currently in its a massive step in the right direction and i hope they fix some more things so it becomes really polished at some point (But knowing Bethesda huhhhh lets just leave that xD)


4 Content:

So after 16 hours ofc i cant say that you can easily spend 100ts of hours because im not there yet. So i cant really give a lot of feedback towards content. But what i can say is that there are a lot of new stuff that came into the game you can work your ass of creating a massive base. You can level up your character into eternity. There are constantly new events happening in the world that you can participate in. There is a MASSIVE world to explore. And season 1 has started and you can level up your character there and get cool stuff. So i think there are tons of things to do for me so ill give and update when im 100 hours + in.


5 Microtrasactions and stuff:

Again like always we all know how many microtransactions are in this game and we all hate it sure. But still after 16 hours i didnt feel the need to waste anything on more stash or private servers or whatever the hell they are trying to sell to you. Some people said its literally impossible to play without more stash. Which is totally untrue at least for me. 

So thats the good thing in the overall bad. 

Im not going to talk more about it or speak good about it. I totally agree with everyone who dislikes the game because of that im on your side. Bethesda went totally overboard on that aspect and i heavily dislike that.



""CONCLUSION AND RATING""

So to conlude everything i can definetly recommend the game to everybody who likes the Fallout franchise in general and can just oversee some of the issues this game has and doesnt pay a lot of attention to them because if you do that it ruins your fun. Yet to people totally new to the franchise and people that are kind of sceptical about the game its really up to you. Its really hard to recommend it to you guys because you are definetly used to games that are polished and good looking and all of that. So Fallout 76 in terms of that yes is a massive downgrade but still its just creating this sort of athmosphere and old school feeling. So if you like that and again can oversee some of the problems the game has i can recomment it to you. 


Its hard to rate this game yet because im only 16 hours in but so far if you consider all of the problems and its good sides that it has my final rating for the game is     

""8/10"". But thats for me personally. Im a big fan of the Fallout franchise and some problems that are really annoying for others are not really affecting me that much im more a guy who likes nice athmosphere and a really chill and fun time.

This game doesn't feel like a fallout game at all.
You have the option to build your buildings just like in fallout 4 but in a wandering camp. It cost money to move the camp. That normally wouldn't be an issue but, that gun, which normally cost 24 caps is worth 1 or 2 caps.
Also that camp I just mentioned, it is a 50/50 chance it will actually spawn into the location you left it at. You still will get all the products you make but you will have either find a new spot or wait until the system finds a new world to spawn your camp into.

As a long time, somewhat hardcore Fallout fan, I boycotted Fallout 76 when it came out. I hated (and still do to some point) the fact that it's an MMO and for that reason your actions don't really effect the game world. Also the grindy nature of the game really turned me off. Still the biggest reason was that there were no NPC's.

I finally decided to give it a try this April when the Wastelanders DLC came out. I played the Wastelanders storyline alongside with original the main story which helped me to not get that bored with all the fetch quests and holotapes of the vanilla F76. There's plenty to dislike in this game; horrible hit boxes, irritating but not challenging enough survival elements, enemy AI, no manual save / load etc. but I still kinda enjoyed my 100 hours with it. Mostly because Bethesda has finally made an open world that is good looking, interesting to explore and versatile enough. Some people complain about the emptiness of the Appalachia but for me it felt ""more Fallout"" than the city ruins of Boston or DC.

53,Fallout 76,71787598,english,"The relation between deadlines and undefined but high expectations suxx, period.

This Fallout game was a mess around the release, generating a hate wave comparable to Mass Effect Andromeda and No Man's Sky. Those two also suffered from the same deadline disease of a hasty release date. Also, they share the same fate of a catastrophic initial rushed version turning into something good later.

Yes, I honestly believe, this game is good. Since its release in 2018 it's been updated, tweaked, enhanced, bugfixed, expanded to the point of being a good experience. The core is shifted towards exploration from a more combat-oriented style of the predecessors but that's not a problem for me, I always enjoyed exploring the wasteland. It goes the same with crafting stuff, I think it was a clever move of Fallout 4 to add purpose for previously useless game filler items. Without running the review too long, I was pleasantly surprised how much Bethesda improved this game in 2 years.

Just a footnote: I don't know what would be a lesser-bltching solution of releasing games these days. The truth is, you gamers (we gamers) became such nagging nitpicking mothertruckers. If the game release is postponed, a hate wave rises because of the delay. If the game comes too early with bugs, a hate wave rises because of the early problems. If the developer labels it as early release, a hate wave rises because it is not the full game yet. If the game keeps the old style a hate wave rises because it brings nothing new. If the game takes a bold move forward a hate wave rises because it is blasphemy. If the developer mentions great ideas pre-release that are realistically too bold to reach by the deadline (and to be added later anyway) a hate wave rises, calling the developer a liar.

57,Fallout 76,71778262,english,"So this game deserved every bit of hate and plus some on release. I really wasn't sure what to think about it back then and I'm glad I held out for as long as I did. I was hesitant to spend any money on this game since the nature of the Atom shop really irked me. After 100 hours I can say that I have enjoyed my time with the game and can see myself spending hundreds more. This game feels like a solid Fallout title even if there are a lot of weird things with the story and mechanics that I am not a fan of.

Without going into to much detail, this one takes place just 25 years after Murica is nuked to hell and back. I would not expect to see and hear about some lore and canon things just 25 years in, and they do retcon and attempt to fix some stuff. Not a fan of some things but such is life. 

The stash limit is freaking SMALL. They really want to push that Fallout First sub crap on you. Don't do it, a lot of the First sub users are not very happy with how it has been handled. While the stash limit is small, its manageable. The problem is that micromanagement of the home base and inventory feels like a chore and was designed with console in mind. I hate having to spend so much time trying to keep some basic crap organized.

While there are still issues and I really could jabber on and on about what I love and hate about the game, I would recommend it to the die hard Fallout fan. The online component really adds a interesting twist to the game. The setting is awesome and the map has some nice variety. I love how each area and zone feels different.

This is not a Fallout game. This is more like a placeholder for mistakes and a reminder for future Fallout games or maybe Bethesda in general.

62,Fallout 76,71776617,english,"This game is not the piece of crap it was at launch. I didn't play it at launch, but I watched enough videos to knows. 

Basically, the higher-ups appear to have rushed the game out before it was even a third finished. Someone at Zenimax said, ""well, you've got a map! Just print it! You've got Skyrim 2 work to do!"" So, it was never really a bad game, it was just a completely unfinished game. At time of writing, with the Wastelanders update, it's still not a finished game but it's much closer, and it is playable, and worth the Fallout experience you get if you get it on sale. It would only be worth $40 if you were paying in anticipation of future content, but right now, I'd say it is worth $20. 

What I will say is that the online elements of the game are almost completely worthless, at least right now. Don't get this game if you want to do missions with your friends. Currently, missions are only designed for one person, so if you play with friends, you will be waiting around for whoever is doing the mission. Supposedly, you can ""look in"" on another person's mission, but that is just a dumb and lazy fix. They need real co-op missions, which I think they will probably add if they keep this pace. 

The other thing is don't think you're going to have a fun time trolling people in this game. PVP is stupid. Even though there are almost no consequences for dying (you only lose your trash), the game still makes PVP basically impossible. For me, it would be a lot more exciting of a game if players were trying to kill me and attacking my base, but that is totally disincentivized. If anything, they could make a two kinds of servers, if they're worried about catering to people afraid of PVP, but most of us enjoy the challenge and excitement of getting in shootouts with real players and that is just not here. 

They could easily make the multiplayer in this game more like Rust, with excitement and trolling, especially if they created different kinds of servers, and I hope they look into that in the future, because the game is otherwise ready for that. 

In general, you aren't even aware you're in a multiplayer game at this point. I think this is something they'll probably fix.

The economy of the game is a mess and prioritizes picking up trash, which many might find boring, especially since you can't steal trash from other players. 

There is a list of bugs, as with all Bethesda games, which I won't go into, but I will say that half the time you feel like the enemy you're fighting is the devs. 

All in all, it's clear the people who made this game cared about what they were doing. There is a lot of love put into it. They just haven't been given the time and resources they need to make the game good. It's actually sad to think about the people who worked on this game and were forced to release it when it was only a third finished. 

At half finished now, it's worth half price.

Yeah sure i havent played many hours in yet so this is basically a ""first few hours in"" reaction. Coop? i dont know, i feel it would have been better if they had just focused on making it single player and filling the game with npcs, shanty towns, exiting quests, Exiting places to explore, etc. I suppose i might change my mind after having played it abit more but so far the feeling is bland and unexiting. They could atleast have given the option to skip out on the ""multiplayer"" part so you dont have other people potentially killing your targets or raiding your camp. Short to say, so far its slightly dissapointing. maybe i might change my mind, maybe i w.ont. What i miss the most is to have the option to give myself endless carryweight, yes i know that is a cheat but in a single player game it wouldnt matter. The fact they made it a mandatory ""multiplayer"" prevents you from even attempting that becouse your probly gonna get banned for ""cheating"" and gaining advantage over other players.

update 2020-06-30

After some more gameplay and carefull consideration i have come to my final conclusion. 

Story: 4/10
Exploration value: 6/10
Gameplay: 5/10
Graphics: 10/10
coop and social value: 8/10

Short version: This is a social game, not a storydriven one. If you just want a game to hang around in with your friends (or strangers) and run around doing stuff that in the end has no effect what so ever on the ending. and doing  ""daily events"" just to keep yourself occupied doing..... something. So basically being social online.

Storywise: Meh. well sure, there is a story but its mediocre and mainly focused on finding a nuclear bunker so you can launch yet another nuke on the wasteland?....  wow..... exiting?
It is playable but if you want a game with a intressting story? this is not for you. there is a few npcs but they are just too spread out and their existence seems almost random.

Exploration value? Well there is plenty to explore. But most of the locations are just ruins filled with enemies. you will find plenty of loot., but since your carryweight is that of a toddler (said from from a perspective of someone who ussually uses unlimited carryweight) you wont be able to bring most of it with you without going overburdened. You may also find holotapes or notes giving you som lore about the places you explore, but most of it means whoever dropped said holotape is already dead long ago. Also..... hunger and thirst will be a big bother if you just want to run around exploring the way its implemented (you get hungry and thirsty really easy, especially if your encumbered with i ussually am becouse **** carryweight! :).

Gameplay? It plays  out like most fallout games, in a nuked world. Personally i would like to be able to opt out of the ""coop"" without having to buy a ""special prenumeration"". but i guess bethesda has sold out to the way other games do it, sadly. i also dont care to too much about all the stuff in the ingame shop i would rather use my caps to buy stuff in game from npc vendors, inside actual cities. and go on exiting questing given by npcs, again, from inside a city. That said, if you care less about a storydriven game where your actions may have consequences and has a ""living"" world. and care mostly about running around doing ""events"", leveling and equiping your character to godhod so you can potentially become strong enough to pvp other players and going around killing random monsters for loot and achivemnets. Sure, this game is for you! :)

Graphics? they are pretty awesome as far as im concerned, so not much to say about that.

Coop? well thats basically waht the game makers seem to have focused on when making it. Things like  ""events"" high level bossmonsters you are best of to join a group if you want to engage etc, gives me the idea that is what bethesda wanted this game to be, a social game. In with it succeeds to be for those who actually do want to join groups or hunt for events. So sure i can give it a decent score on that point, even if i personally dont find it that appealing.",1593234750,1593533653,TRUE,3,0,0.520667374,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,596,100,822,0,402,1594134767

Would watch awkward Scorched run animations again. 

The game is basically online multiplayer Fallout 4 in survival mode, should you choose to play it that way. You can also play on a private world if you have a subscription. With the addition of Wastelanders and quests, it's turned into a pretty fun game. Plenty to keep me busy as I level up a new character.

Pros:
-Beautiful, massive, open world
-Build your character however you want
-Lots of weapons to choose from and mod for your playstayle
-Some items are account-wide, so if you start a new character you get a bit of a head start
-You can build up your camp and also other areas where workbenches are present, you can also share your camp with NPCs
-There is a story, and it's improving
-Fallout 4 survival mode, BUT with the ability to fast travel to locations you've previously discovered

Cons
-Enemies near your level as you're leveling up tend to be bullet sponges, so you run out of ammo constantly
-Still light on story content, but it's improving and it looks like they're adding to the game
-Some of the animations are pretty terribad and can make it difficult to hit things
-Some items disappear from the Atomic Shop, hopefully they will be back, as a new player I've missed out on a lot

Pros:
-very fun to play with friends
-hours of gameplay
-amazing environment

Cons:
-very long sometimes
-gets repetitive
-it's too easy (unless you go to higher level areas)

I would recommend this game to people who are looking for a game to grind on. If you don't have much hours to spare in the game you won't get very far.

PVE:
Great solo fun and with wastelanders quest line it became really cool, but do not buy if your looking for a multiplayer game with end game content, because the multiplayer is very limited (no zone chat) and now im at the end game i can get through all the hardest content in the game within 2 hours, there is not enouth end game content to keep any mmo player entertained, no reason to grind for the best weapons or armor, because you dont need them, the game becomes no challenge at all in end game, this game need instances that are challenging and limited to x amount of players, until then its a nice game for abit of fun but no reason to hang around or pay for fallout 1st for more than 2 months.

PVP: 
Quite possibly the most unenjoyable pvp experiance you will ever encounter, only battle royal mode, so you will wait 10 minutes to join a game, get 1 shot by a camper or hacker or someone with frog leg perk that jumps so high you cant hit them then realise you done nothing for 15 minutes, repeat.

BUGS: 
There are an INSANE amount of bugs in the game, and the dev team refuses to spend time to fix them, this team are very very slow compared to other games of fixing or adding good content.

5,Fallout 76,71549163,english,"[h1]In the end, a disappointment.[/h1]
[i]The points made in the positive reviews are valid however, and I agree to most of them.[/i]

But coming from a long time fan since FO3 I am sad to say that it wasn't worth my time in the end.

I originally played this game during the free weekend and really enjoyed myself, I eventually purchased it looking forward to diving myself further into this new Fallout world. 
By the time I reached 25 hours in however, I really started to notice the bugs and broken mechanics. People write about this a lot in all the reviews you'll read here and if you are hoping that you won't notice them that much you will sorely wrong. I started this game post Wastelanders update so I was expecting a mostly smooth experience but once I had played it enough I couldn't avoid noticing them.

The other issue is the core gameplay. It kind of feels like FO4, and it kind of seems to be an improvement, but once you consider the mutliplayer aspect of it all it's a completely different game. The point of which is to show off high level gear to others when you do a random world event. If that's your jam, then this is the game for you.

I also didn't know if I was going to successfully complete a quest because there's no way to know if you are too underlevelled for it until the last minute when you arrive at the quest marker and there's a level check in the form of high level mobs waiting for you. A lot of my time was wasted by this, and made for an unsatisfying experience.

I started playing FO4 again when I was playing this for the first time, and the smoothness of the old game was so clear, the addition of mods and the lack of lag was something I realise that I missed in this game.

But there are some redeeming things about F76, the world is gorgeous, the First Responders as a faction is something I really appreciate and the improvements to menu's and the quick selection wheel were somethings that helped a lot with gameplay. Perk cards are also great despite making you feel a bit locked into a certain character build.

I just hope that one day we can get a version of this game offline and completely singleplayer. Imagine how good and how much more successful that game would be.",1593326921,1593326921,FALSE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,269,2,2080,0,2080,1591591105

34,Fallout 76,71502053,english,"This game is great fun with friends who are just starting out the same as you. If you are a fan of previous fallouts this game is great, before this game had npc's (non-playable characters) i would not have recommended the game for the £35 price tag. However in its current state with npc's added in the game it is great fun with friends. This is however a drawback as i feel this game does suffer on solo play as making teams is some what difficult and the player base is not always the most welcoming. 

However that said the game does provide a usual fallout story that we are all used to, with npc's and companions being added to the wastelanders dlc with a story the kept me hooked for the most part, till it ended. When all is said and done in the wastelanders dlc and you reach level 50 (for example) the game does become a little dull, after about 100 hours i found myself wondering what to do, set of a few nukes or just play around, it was all very dull after the wastelanders dlc was over.

So overall i would recommend this game to players who liked the old fallouts and want to play it with friends for a fun experience, or a solo player who likes story based games, although currently main story is still lackluster after finishing the wastelanders expansion, this game is great and i had a blast with friends and i would recommend it for this reason, if you are a solo player you may get bored on your own as it is a vast world, but if you enjoy story then go ahead and get the game.

P.S: (MINOR WASTELANDER STORY SPOILER AHEAD) there is a new currency at the end of wastelanders that does add replyability but it is a big grind to get anything you want and is very long however, soon they will be adding a new battlepass for players that may give us more content after wastelander story quest this may enrich the replayability that the game has a lack of at the moment.

Hope this review helps anyone on their decision :)",1593275569,1593275569,TRUE,1,0,0.523809552,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,45,2,8106,0,8018,1594077272

I spent a lot of time on this, all too often reminded of better experiences found during my tour of Fallout 2, New Vegas, or even Fallout 4. There were times when I found myself wishing that I had wasted my time grinding away at a much more fulfilling multiplayer experience such as GTA Online LMAO. Pleasant, friendly, helpful multiplayer culture though. 

I really wanted to give this game a good review, because there are some fun and exciting moments to be found. Unfortunately I also experienced waaay too many immersion breaking set-backs (bugs, crashes, server failures) during crucial moments in the narrative, when I should have been experiencing awe and wonder.

83,Fallout 76,71355098,english,"So i have decided to write this because I, like many of you reading this was unsure about this game after witnessing a near constant stream of negativity towards it online. I've been a Fallout fan since around 2008-2009 and I think i can safely say that i've put more hours into New Vegas than any other game. In this review i'm going to try and stick to the things which stood out whilst i was playing, both positive and negative.

I've been having a lot of fun with this game over the past couple weeks and have had some memorable encounters with other players who helped me out when i was a low level with supplies and weapons. The gameplay is solid and virtually unchanged from Fallout 4 besides the new perk system which i find more interesting than the one we had previously. I've run into a few bugs and the server has crashed a couple times but both have been rare enough for them not to impact my experience too much.

The Map:
It's huge. Seriously. I don't normally use fast travel in fallout games but it's almost essential here as a lot of the quests will have you visiting multiple locations with long distances between them which can quickly become tedious. However, bear in mind that you will have to pay for fast travel to locations besides a few designated points and this can cost a fair amount depending on the distance travelled. Thankfully the map is quite varied and many of the locations are unique and interesting, and in my opinion it's a far more interesting setting that Boston which i felt was essentially just a retread of Washington D.C.

Community:
Players seem very friendly for the most part and as a i mentioned earlier i've seen people go out of their way to help low level players. However, i don't know why after this length of time Bethesda hasn't implemented a text chat especially when it seems as though so few players are using their mic's. Not being able to communicate with other players effectively can really damage games such as this and when the fix is so straightforward it confuses me as to why they haven't addressed the issue.

Summary: 
I don't want this review to be too long so i'll finish by saying that after a good year and a half of this game being one big joke to us all, it might finally be time for us all to stop laughing at it and give it a go.

Fallout 5 really

I never played Fallout 4, bypassing from New Vegas straight to Fallout 76. My main reasons why I didn't was because of the forced parental role thrust upon you, lack of proper dialog choices and of course the voiced protagonist. Thankfully, those restrictions are gone in this Fallout, allowing you to thankfully be pretty much any character you want to be in style with the previous Fallouts.

Fallout 76 also boosts a fantastic map that is full of surprises and things to explore. The difficulty is refreshingly difficult, made even more difficult by the lack of ability to save scum anymore just like in the offline Fallouts. Quests are average, but it's the looting, shooting and exploring I came for really anyway.

If you liked Fallout 3, New Vegas and Fallout 4, it's really difficult not to like Fallot 76. Yes, there are bugs but this is BETHESDA FFS!

I'm writing this after having 300h of play so I believe I touched every point of the game.

What I like the most:
* Base building is a blast. Maybe 50h of all my game time is just perfecting my base. There are tons of cosmetics here which 90% of them can be acquired by doing quests, workshop challenges, or purchased from a vendor.
* In-game Cash (used for micro transaction) can be acquired by ""playing"" the game. Yes, just by doing daily and weekly challenges you can earn Cash and you can buy everything you like.
* So many quests! It's so difficult to focus on your main mission while finding so many interesting quests on the way. It took me more than 200h to finish the main quest. Yes, because I got distracted...
* Ever-evolving game content. Every now and then there are more monsters to kill, more weapons to loot, more quests to do... The devs are still investing heavily to this game.
* 1st Membership is not a must. You can play the game without paying and you won't be limited with anything. Scrapbox is the main reason you would buy membership.
* Friendly Community! I've never seen such a friendly and helpful community in any other online game. Well actually I was expecting a full package of toxicity and harassing behaviors; not at all... Although you can just start attacking people's bases and destroy everything, steal their resources and make them suffer, nobody does that! Only time my base was attacked happened by 4 people wearing Raider Power Armor and when I tried to intervene, they asked for money! So instead I attacked and they killed me. Then I return to my base and they were still there asking for money. So, I paid 1.000 caps and they left. It was not toxic, it was AMAZING! This is how raiders behave and that was a pure role play!
* Easy to grind! Yes, what I hate in online games the most is unlimited hours of grinding the same material over and over. It's not the case here.
* Every single quest is a Fallout quest, not that classic MMORPG quests such as ""go kill 24 wolfs 
* If you have a strong computer, visuals are mesmerizing. Especially the light effects in a forest... Crazy.
* Leveling up is not difficult and very rewarding. Even after 100 levels you'll still want to level up because of skill cards. 
* Difficulty of the game is just nice. I always feel challenged and still die time to time. It's good!
* You can pretty much finish everything in the game solo, especially if you have your own world with 1st. So, in contrast to 99% of the MMORPG's that you need a bunch of friends or unknown people to complete end game content, here you can go completely solo. I love it!

What could be better:
- Legendary item grinding is very difficult especially if you're not a lucky type (like me).
- 30.000 bottle caps limit is stupid. I don't know why it's 30.000…
- Game meta lacks of creativity. There are only 2 dominating meta for now, Low Health (Bloody) and Addiction (Junkie); and I don’t like them. So I play my “weak” style.

All in all, Fallout 76 is a very beautiful game and as far as I read from the old reviews, it actually become a real ""Labor of Love""

I purchased this game AFTER Wastelanders dropped.

========================
[h1]The Gameplay/World[/h1]
========================
Solid gunplay, great movement (improved by certain Mutations), and the map is beautiful. This is the first Fallout game since Lonesome Road that makes use of its verticality, and it has been refined so much more.

I still have reservations about the weapon leveling system, but I do like how weapons are more like sidegrades than direct upgrades most of the time. There are reasons to use the Pipe Pistol over the Assault Rifle at times, regardless of perks, and it makes you actually consider how you go about building your character.

The leveling system also gave me reservations. Upgrading your SPECIAL until level 50 and being able to change all of your perks on the fly? I thought it would lead to a generalist that can sometimes specialize, but after reaching Level 130+, I have a newfound appreciation. You cannot do everything, and you must choose what you're going to do and do it well. You do not have to waste your perk slots with Picklock and Hacker perks until you need them, although it is a hassle to switch for now (might revisit when Perk Loadouts are added to the game). Overall, this is a great step up from Fallout 4's leveling system and I can see the Perk Cards being a mainstay in the series. We do not need Skills, but we do need our character building to really matter, and this system is a major step in the right direction.

Mutations are certainly a unique addition to the game. While not all of them are useful, many of them can greatly boost your power and stack well with many different loadouts. The Bloodied Build may be a bit too powerful, though, but it is satisfying being able to solo-duel a Wendigo Colossus thanks to Nerd Rage, Adrenal Reaction, and a Bloodied Gauntlet.

Picklock and Hacking are the same as they've been since Fallout 3, so that's still not fun, but hacklock minigames... hacklock minigames never change.

========================
[h1]The Story[/h1]
========================
This will be split between the Launch Story and the Wastelanders Story, respectively.

A boring, passive story about people before you doing incredible things and you just putting the finishing touches on their work. No choices, no real engagement.

An active, engaging story about how best to rebuild Post-War America after discovering [spoiler]a vault filled with all the gold in America[/spoiler]. You are asked to make tough calls, have a real reason to pick the Raiders, as they are not mindless thugs all the time and do have a philosophy of meritocracy and have the strength to defend Appalachia. Not to say the Settlers are a bad call, as they have honorable contracts and believe in hard work, however they have very few mutants in their ranks. When you [spoiler]raid the vault[/spoiler], you have many choices for how you deal with the job. [spoiler]You can send people away, guide them through the steps, and help them either survive... or have them killed[/spoiler].

[h1]Nuclear Winter[/h1]
========================
I hate Battle Royale. It's not fun and I only played it for the timed rewards. Overall, a worthless addition to the game.

[h1]Closing Statements[/h1]
========================
A decent game well worth 150 hours. Don't buy the Wastelanders bundle, as it's not worth it. I purchased Fallout 1st, and it's... a thing? I'm not sure if it's really worth it or not, but it feels the Scrapbox is almost essential.

I had to stop playing the game because it has gotten to a point where the combat is impossible to deal with on a technical level. 

Hit Detection barely works, Enemies will constantly hit you through any object on the map while your shots miss due to lag and extreme framerate/stutter problems or you manage to hit the tiniest of objects (which doesn't apply to the enemies). Your character clips and gets stuck on everything around them and half the time the controls aren't responsive, If you attempt to run or do any actions, usually they won't work.

Very much a great game of the classic era, and after a few bug patches, one of the best games ever made. It took a long time to play and everyone played it several times. Minimal crafting, mostly scavenging. 
Unfortunately it was to become bloatware with expansions. They added and removed features, overpowered the weapons, added heavy modding and crafting. changed the faction loyalty, dumbed down the game play to mostly shoot and get loot. GECK anyone? Nuka Quantum: 10,  Expansions: 7

Finding that this worked for profitability.....they planned the next installment. 

Then came Fallout 4: What to say, a heavily modded Fallout 3 with new textures! And now you have to build towns and bases to keep the waseland safe. Or not based on how you play. This time you had to go and complete the utterly complex but thoroughly boring storyline of one of the factions to complete the game. Also you had to craft everything, super fun for those who would rather not grind for components.  What happened to finding the GECK? Really more of the same from 3 to 4, with the same bugs, and drawbacks but more grinding. Nuka Orange: 8.2

Fallout 76: There are 2 versions of this game. 
1. Pre wastelanders
2, Post wastelanders

The pre game ranked as one of the worst implementations of a legendary game since Duke Nukem Forever. No NPCs, only robots and hostile players, No morality choices at all other than lying, The robots were dumbed down, and the plot was stupid. Looks like a gigantic game that was unfinished and rushed to market due to corporate publishing choices. We all knew that, and boy did it stink. Buggy and broken, the players soldiered on because hey this is Fallout. Still no GECK? 

Post Wastelanders is better with some diversity, and NPC's. But talk about some bad things. There is all grinding for crafting materials, et al Skyrim, but now with a few people! The factions dont allow you to make anything of them, just that they exist and they are all low level mostly. We are now on a cloud server, which requires you to log in and play with about 20 other live players. Even better, they now have a pay to play option where you can buy up to be better than other players. No so cool. Also if you dont pay, your game will be limited to 800 lbs of gear permanently, That's really stupid because it will require you to build other players to hand off the stuff you want to keep. Likely its due to having to buy virtual server space from somebody and to have more space you have to pay for it. 
The graphics are good on PC and OK on xbox, the seasons, and day night is cool but came in Fallout 3/4 too. Crafting is reasonable to use, armor and weapons take a while to acquire, but that is ok. Unfortunately they are level capped, so you will have to wait until you level up to use them. Food and water are well integrated and require you to feed and drink regularly. The plots are mundane, and its mostly kill some guys, scavenge a bunch, get overloaded and walk home, Over and over. There are a few public events, but the level 300 guy always ruins them. The map is big and plentiful, but where are the factions, where are the moral choices, where is the ruined landscape of the wasteland, Where is the GECK? The saving grace is that they added sandbox features to build a base and sell stuff you dont need. However this is also broken as you cannot move a complex base due to bugs, and as soon as you build a complex base, it tells you you have run out of workshop space and cant display stuff, or sell it. This is a very WTF moment, as its really the best feature of the game. So to summarize: 76 looks good, plays below Fallout 3 by a few points, and really needs some interesting hidden places, and moral choices. Grinding sucks and being limited to force additional purchases is a utterly lousy way to make a game. Bethesda should kick itself in the balls for releasing early, not completing it on time, then adding slapdash mods to fill the holes. Content takes time, and needed at least another year to fill out the game. Playable and if you are a fan recommended with caution.

That you cant do this in the games UI is unforgivable for console users who cant do this and silly to PC players, who should not have to edit script files just to change some elementary video settings.

-All the games textures are fallout 4 recycled. Sure they added some workshop content, but the world and npc's are made up of fallout 4 bits and pieces. 

-I never played pre-wastelanders, but I can see how it deserved its criticism up till now.

-The world is large but mostly just spread out over broad forested and mountain areas. However once fully explored the map was okay i guess. Not great, not even good, just okay.

-VATS doesnt work right sometimes. 95% chance to hit = 5 or 6 consecutive misses. Not all the time, but this happens to often to forgive.

-Leveling and perk card system grew on me as i progressed. Now i rather like it. But the constant switching around of perk cards to reconfigure your character for specific situtations is tedious to say the least, off putting at most.

-Paywalling. I am ashamed that i paid for the fallout 1rst membership. Felt like i had to as there is a stash limit of 800 in your camp. This includes everything. That simply is an arbitrary limit to force customers to the fallout 1rst membership that gives u unlimited scrap storage, so you can use the 800 units of camp storage for everything else, mostly ammo i find. This artificial limit is simply BS , and any excuse to the contrary is a lie. I hate that i paid for it and i am ashamed i am a fallout 1rst member. In any other cases i would not endorse this game at all simply for that. Shame on you Bethesda.

-As one would hope form a good fallout game, writers and storytellers did a good job filling up the world with some interesting stories and all sorts of mad science to amuse and entertain. It will certainly scratch your itch for post apocalyptic retro future vault dwelling fun. I often enjoyed most the of the quests. Not the tadpole crap though. hated that. Merit badges for doing obscure and boring chores mostly. Many involving high level recipes you wont simply find easily. Dumb.

There is other stuff too, but i would say those are the key things that come to mind for me. So i will keep it brief.

Overall I am giving it a plus, not because bethesda's business model in any way warrants it, but because despite all its shortcomings, of which there are still many, i ended up loving it anyways, but only because i love fallout so much,
i believe its design flaws are the result of a greedy publisher, not the games designers and programmers.

13,Fallout 76,67338923,english,"After spending more than 250 hours in Appalachia and having completed the main quest, most side quests and events and farmed reputation and dailies for a few weeks I can safely say whether or not this game succeeds is a matter of perspective. 

First, the one thing Bethesda games have always been praised for is their worlds, which are always credible, they always feel alive and are fun to explore, in this regard Appalachia is no exception, this must be the most compelling world they've created up to now, wherever you look you can find details and micro-stories told by the environmental detail. Bethesda nails the feeling of loneliness and desolation -for better or worse- and the need to scavenge and craft in order to survive, at the very least the fantasy of that since there is really no penalty for dying. 

Secondly, the 'chasing ghosts' narrative focus this game is perfect for the solo player whose primary focus is immersing itself in this world, only under this mindset you can truly enjoy the narrative for what it is, the same can't be said for the team player, or the player who treats this game as a MMOlite or looter-shooter or whatever subgenre you think it fits, the players looking for a compelling team-based gameplay won't enjoy this world as much as the solo player. On the same topic, there isn't really a good incentive to grind and do dailies since there is no real end-game, players looking for a game to come and play on a daily basis, with raids or objectives to topple won't feel at home here. 

The third and final aspect I wanted to talk about are the C.A.M.P-building mechanics,  you are given a great amount of freedom in terms on what you can do with camps, you can invest dozens of hours just scavenging for mats and building your perfect camp, or spend 10 minutes and still have a fully functional camp, the best cosmetic stuff is still trapped behind microtransactions, but the currency used is grindeable in-game and you don't really need it to have a truly wonderful camp. Just for reference I've never spent any money in the atomic shop and still have been able to buy 1-2 objects per week.

Finally, and returning to the initial thesis of the matter of perspective, it really depends on what you want to do within the game, it took me about 250 hours to feel like I 'completed' the game, and the fact that there is no more pending content for me -at least as of now- does not erase the fact that I had fun and enjoyed myself for 250 hours, and even though I am ready to move on from Appalachia now I will remember my times fondly rather than salty.",1586922296,1592939330,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,151,16,19254,0,15522,1597212854

36,Fallout 76,71155352,english,"TL;DR at the bottom.

As an avid Fallout player, I have played all of them, save for the first. Fallout is easily one of, if not, my favorite franchises in gaming.

When FO76 first came out, I watched the tragedy that unfolded; the horrible reviews, the hilarious, egregious bugs that were game breaking, Todd Howard memes degrading in quality until they were nothing but deep-fried crust.

I felt that my favorite franchise died that day, I had quickly become incredibly opposed to FO76, mocking it at any chance I could.

Now here I am, level 80, with 115 hours in the game, giving it a positive review on Steam, years after release. How could this happen, you ask? Truth be told I've been asking the same question.

First, let's focus on the experience of the game, starting with...

[h1]Presentation[/h1]

[b]Visually[/b], I wouldn't say it is an upgrade, so much as they just added more post-fx. The game looks identical to FO4 in pretty much every way, aside from the fact that things look wet 80% of the time, especially your character's vault suit/armor; it looks like you just took a swim even if you've never even been near water.

[b]Animations[/b] are classic Bethesda; generally pretty bad but serviceable... unless you play in third-person. At least for female characters, they have very... strange looking bodies, mostly in the shoulders. The sprint animation is borderline comedic in how bad it is. As well, recoil animations for guns are just terrible in third-person. Even a fairly low-recoil cartridge like 5.56 will send your characters shoulder into spasms as if they just fired a .50 BMG from the shoulder.

First-person animations are exactly the same as in FO4, with really no difference that I could spot aside from the new weapons like the MG42.

My favorite part of the games visuals are the copious amounts of minor issues, like T-posing skeletons phasing through a mine cart, or NPCs standing on a chair, their calves submerged in the furniture. Truly, this game is set in a bizarre alternate reality where everyone is half-specter.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]

This is where the review is gonna probably drag on, but I really want to hammer home what you're in for with this title.

[b]Combat[/b] is pretty good through out, shining around level 30 - 50 when you get higher tier weapons that break less, and pack a decent punch. Bullet-sponge enemies do exist, and if you don't spec into a fair bit of damage cards early on, you're going to have a rough time of it, but generally if you're building decently, or get very lucky with a legendary, it'll be pretty consistent across the board... assuming you aren't in a server with a lot of high levels. 

Around level 50 is when you need to start carefully considering your build, since enemies will be getting remarkably tougher, and your weapon level is capped at 45 - 50. This is where you'll need to really think on a build and, until you have a surplus of stored levels and cards, you really, really need to spec in one weapon type. If you don't, this game quickly becomes hell-on-earth when you come across the stronger enemies.

Speaking of which; Enemies spawn based off the level of the first person to visit the area. So you can easily go from fighting level 4 Scorched in one area, to fighting level 46 - 68 Scorched just by moving a quarter mile. It's supremely awful.

[b]Leveling[/b] early on is a slog. You will fight a lot, and a majority of your XP will come from combat and events. Quests do not reward very much XP on completion, some main quests giving a measly 250, which is only a few kills worth. You will be doing a lot of the same events, and staying in a general area for long periods of time as you level, which brings me to...

[b]Quests[/b]. They're awful. Simply the worst in the series. They are very MMO-esque, almost every single one was a fetch quest that has you going long distances for a simple item, only to get it, then be rewarded with another step of exactly the same damned thing. The worst offender is absolutely the quest lines with Rose. By the end of it, which took me about 4 days to finish, I was exhausted and irritated, every time she spoke, I could feel myself getting agitated. 

Speaking of which, to the person who was clearly having a terrible week and made that DMV quest for the Brotherhood. Why? Who hurt you? I'm not mad, I'm just disappointed. And mad.

You will feel something from the quests, and it's mostly annoyance, demotivation, and in some cases, actual anger. But, at least you'll feel something, unlike...

[b]Events[/b]. They get old, very, very fast. Powering Up events were my favorite, but most of them can be flat out agonizing after you've done them 15+ times. There is variety, but it runs out fast. And even after you get a comfortable level, you will need to continue doing them. A lot. You know what else you'll be doing a lot of?

[b]Collecting Resources[/b]! This is by far the most cathartic experience, as well as the most infuriating. I foresaw what was ahead of me, and committed the ultimate sin. I subscribed to Fallout 1st.

I am very, very happy I made that choice. Even with all of my materials in a separate box, I am always at 250+ weight and my box is always full. This game has the most brutal inventory management I have ever witnessed, it will drive you absolutely insane, it will frustrate you endlessly, until you crack, and begin just selling off things you [i]probably[/i] won't need. 

You haven't used that weapon in a day, in the trash it goes! What's a heavy weapon? That thing that takes up space for my 57,371 .38 rounds? Does any weapon even [i]use .38?[/i] Should probably save it anyways and scrap this Bloodied Ultracite Gatling Laser ☆☆☆.

In a game that is notorious for hoarding, this 800lb limit is absurd to have, especially for people without FO 1st. If you can manage to play this long term without it, you are a much stronger person than I, and I applaud your valiant effort.

That being said, I suck at inventory management, even since Diablo 2.

[h1]TL;DR & Justification for me enjoying this game[/h1]

[b]Pros[/b]
+Fallout 4 with friends, basically.
+Servers are much more stable than on launch.
+The NPCs in the factions (at least Raiders) are pretty great, Johnny is best man.
+Fun, addictive and mostly simple gameplay loop.
+Very detailed open world with tons of interesting stories and crannies to explore.
+Card system is actually really fun to build with, and many builds are viable endgame.
+Majority of bugs are hilarious and don't affect the gameplay.
+Extremely wholesome community!

[b]Cons[/b]
-Game runs horrible, remarkably worse than FO4.
-Online only, and any amount of lag is very, very noticeable.
-Fallout 1st is almost required late-game if you don't want to go bald.
-Insanely grindy endgame content, actually takes months to get anywhere.
-Extremely heavy RNG reliance to get anything.
-Enemies spawn at the level of whoever visited the area first, making for insane, sometimes impossible difficulty curves.
-Durability system is just plain awful and adds to the already intensive micromanaging.
-Quests are just plain terrible.
-Stash will fill up FAST.

Now, as a person who loved FO:NV's amazing quests, stories, and fun DLC, someone who grew up with the series, why do I like this game?

It's fun... And really, that's all I want from a game. There is a lot of problems, many inexcusable [i]features,[/i] but the game is still fun to me, and really, that's enough to keep me playing, and I think if you can get it on a sale, give it a try; It might surprise you.

- Decent Graphics
- Enjoyable gameplay 
- Power Armours (Fun as hell using them, tinkering and upgrading)
- Crafting

- Friendly & helpful community

- Vendors - Selling items to other players for extra caps.

- Enemy level scailing is way off lol
- Private World - Only accessible if you got a subscription
- Bugs and the occassionally stuttering, no crashes though

The map is awesome, its filled with mountains, badass locations such as a huge ass bridge, a nature trail and even a fucking crashed space station and much much more. Its truly epic!

Thanks to the addition of wastelanders the game now also has brand new human NPC's along with a fuck ton of new quests and new content such as being able to have companions, joining a faction (basically the the Light side or the Dark side) and plenty more.

Honestly i would say its not a scratch compared to New Vegas but compared to Fallout 4 i would say it is a vast improvement thanks to the bigger and better map, better graphics, more choices (thanks to wastelanders) and various minor fixes and changes here and there

At the end of the day i would say give it try.

On the flip side, if for some reason you dislike the game you can just request a refund now thanks to it being on steam. Incredible!

[b]1. This is not Fallout.[/b]

The atmosphere is just not there. Everyone is cheerful, colours are bright, players are running around in ridiculous clown outfits and even clown power armours, quest NPCs assault highly fortified positions wearing bathrobes and using handguns. There's even an affirmative action camp. None of this matches the supposedly grim atmosphere of a post-apocalyptic world with survival at stake, breaking immersion.

[b]2. The game is in beta state.[/b]

Pre-Wastelanders this was a clear alpha, now it moved to beta. While it's playable, there are lots of persistent bugs (how about not being able to acquire the new endgame currency, and this is ""under investigation"" for 2 months by now), and it simply lacks endgame content. If you return in a year or so, it should be closer to release quality.

Pros:
* It is a fallout game.
* Works on Proton! Sort of.. you need to use the GloriousEggroll variant, and command line option needs to be set. 
* Is it fun? Playing solo, eh. With friends, probably! It is about what you'd expect from a fallout game, just less human NPCs(which makes sense, you play as one of the first out).
* They did figure out that human NPCs are needed and they did add them in.
* I have been enjoying the quests so far. 

Cons:
* Bethesda controls the difficulty. The whole thing is just a networked Fallout 4. Because of multiplayer, they cranked the difficulty up Very Hard.
* With above in mind, you cannot save. If you die, you loose all the bullets you spent trying to survive whatever killed you.
* Servers are running on the cheapest AWS compute instances, so expect server and network lag, and to be rotated 90 degrees at random, or teleported back in time 2 seconds. 
* Wouldn't be a Bethesda game without crashes, and to make matters worse, you can't use patches without the risk of being banned. Although Bethesda is vague with whether or not mods are allowed, they seem to just ban if they feel like banning someone.
* Optimization was optional during development.
* Perk tree system is bad, can't choose what you want to level up, got to hope on chance you get the right cards.

Since this is a review:::

It's more or less a Fallout game with online features and a shop that you can ignore entirely or indulge in if you're proficient enough or got the money to burn.
Everything is time oriented for spawns and loot and events so there's no feel for urgency to complete something. More of an at your own pace feel. Just as Fo4, FoNV and Fo3. The C.A.M.P. system is cool to have due to being able to change scenery as you wish, with restraints of inability to build in towns and near other structures. If you pay for Fallout 1st, you get a ""Private"" Server, a Scrap box that is an indefinite invisible junk inventory that deposits your junk and takes the weight off and a Tent that you can place down that acts as a 3rd fast travel with a scrap box aside from YOUR placed C.A.M.P. and Vault 76. The building works better than Fallout 4's from my perspective. Although the V.A.T.S is buggy at times, but made fun for the factor of having an Instigating Combat Shotgun (damage is doubled if enemy health is full) and the Chinese Stealth Suit makes 80% of enemies a 1 shot as long as you get the sneak attack bonus while using V.A.T.S. with a 95% hit chance. The way the questing feels, it feels like a Fallout. Average fetch quests, go here kill that/get this. Fallout.

---> Just look past most people's opinions, give it a try on a free weekend. Or buy it on a deal. I feel it's worth the $60 if you enjoy wandering aimlessly while doing your normal Fallout activities. The addition of public events adds to the fun of looting <---

I think there are some quality of life issues that are things you expect a high level developer to consider when it comes to gameplay.

You see this a lot in companies like Bethesda and Activision these days.

Now that I have it, I can stand by my opinion that it isn't a shit game when you consider that a lot of the problems with it were probably addressed by the gameplay programmers, but the higher ups probably said ""nah, let's put that behind a paywall or release it as a DLC"".

My biggest complaint is this game could be like Destiny 2 with the reach Fallout storyline, instead it feels like everything is just tacked on. PVP in the game?

Eventually, you can collect all perk cards, though the special/stat points are limited. You can change the points around with a level-up, though, which is great, and there doesn't seem to be a max level.

The camp system is fun too, sometimes a little frustrating with snaping things together issues, but overall very fun with creativity. For example, I had fun designing an above ground platform with little buildings, looks like a mini village with a giant porch. For each of my buildings I designed to have a purpose, one for my vending machines to sell stuff, another for my reactors, and then my house with crafting and display tables, etc. Though, you can choose to have a camp you can move all the time (if you have the caps for it), I just prefer to stay at one area for a while.

You can earn free atoms and unlock nicer things in the atom shop for your camp or outfits/skin, and you can find and buy plans for camp stuff and outfits ingame through npcs or places ingame/quests, too. They sometimes give out free stuff, too (in the atom shop), so it's good to keep an eye on it.

I haven't played the game before wastelanders update, but am glad they added npcs with questlines, npcs make the game feel more alive. I couldn't imagine the game without npcs, seems like it would be duller. You also have random encounter npcs or events you can trigger with exploration. Some events have a chance to drop an outfit, or may drop weapon/armor/camp plans (plans are a craftable version of an item). Also, it's nice you can learn plans from scrapping armor/weapons in the world.

Overall, seems like a fun sandbox with optional quests, and I'm enjoying it. I played some of the other fallout games like fallout NV, 3, and 4, those are more questline based, this one is more sandbox. Exploration is pretty fun in itself, the game is very large. But this game does have some rpg elements to it, and I find it very enjoyable to play. It doesn't have the follower combat system like previous games (kinda miss that), instead there's an ally system where one ally can stay at your camp and give quests. The npcs dialog in quests does have special point prompts from time to time, which is awesome.

Bethesda seems interested in adding more content over time, hopefully that keeps up, I would love to see more questlines or more npc content stuff. Maybe not the opinion of everyone, but I personally find it more enjoyable to have a npc to give you quests or events in a game, seems more fun to do them if you have interesting dialog with a face attached to the dialog. 
(Reason I'm talking about that is because before wastlelanders update, from what I've read, it seems they relied on holotapes for nearly everything).

I heard what a dumpster fire this game was at launch and avoided it until recently when I saw it on Steam. One could argue that it's still a dumpster fire. Player vending was disabled for the majority of the time I've played. A special event was delayed because of spawning issues. The daily limits are obnoxious, and you're limited on storage (unless you throw down a Franklin for a year of FO1). I'd agree with other reviewers that after the Wastelanders story, the game gets a little meh. And the Bloodied build meta is like steroids in Major League Baseball.

Overall, I've enjoyed the game so far and plan to continue playing. It's not the best Fallout, but I think its better than looking for you son in the wasteland. I've had a sidekick during most of my adventures, which is really the reason I bought FO76, but the rest of the community has been great. I liked the base building in FO4, and have been operating a semi-successful merchant operation outside of Whitesprings. The perk card system confused me for awhile, but I think it's great.

43,Fallout 76,70806236,english,"So the game has changed now it's time for me to make a new review


Pros
Co-op and player economy:These two things easily make the game much better as you and your friends can play a fallout on different computers together and then sell your loot for some profit and then use said profit to get better equipment from another player. It all feeds into it self

Map. Big enough that i still haven't been to each corner yet

Weapons:An average amount of variety but the game could use more legendary effects for weapons and armor.

Nukes:You get to nuke a small section of land what could you not like about nuking something? you could use it to nuke another player or something literally it's up to you

Cons
Nukes:Just got nuked? well tough luck for you pal

Graphics:Everything has shadowing nothing makes sense and if you base at the whitespring prepare for lag. I have an rtx 2 070 and 24 gigs of ram and i still get slowdowns at the whitesrping

Weapon durability:If something hits you everything takes a small tink of durability damage. You could be whailing on a wendigo and he smacks you and for some reason your combat shotgun just broke. Like what? I wasn't even using it why did it break?

Incentive to buy repair kits:You either will use the free atoms you get from doing challenges and stuff to get these babys or you will hope and pray that you have enough resources to cover the cost of repairing things. Power armor is alright though it doesn't cost your entire life savings and kidney to repair

The npc traders:Why is the caps pool shared? this makes no sense and also what happened to being able to trade an npc and barter with them with any item to try and get the price lower? i have 20 mini nukes in my stash box and they cannot be sold to anyone or any npc except some super mutant WHO NEVER SHOWS UP but on topic again i can no longer barter with items to get lower prices it's either i buy the item out right or nothing. No barter allowed here i guess

The quests: They are not linked so you have to go find them also the quests don't tell you the perks and advantages for picking a certain side. I went raiders for a certain quest and i regret it because now i have a weapon over powered for stealth builds but i can't exploit that precious x2 damage because i didn't know the rewards up front. Seriously tell the players the advantages and disadvantages for picking a side in that quest.

The lack of armor. You will find the main 5 armors. Leather, Robot, Metal, Raider, Combat and marine. these are the only ones that provide any sort of protection from damage (gas masks provide a protection but not to damage types only to gas and water) which is pretty bad as now i can no longer go hmmm this leather duster is great for one damage but this vault suit is pretty good balance for the two.


The enemy npcs:No. If you do not have a broken or op weapon after level 50 you will find yourself reloading more times on a single enemy then ever. Basically it just becomes a chore to kill any enemy.

The drab colours of fallout 4 are fixed here with a brighter and more vivid environment, although glitchy at times and performance could be optimized.

Everything was perfect until around 60 hours of play, where I started gathering so much legendaries for scrips, various ingredients and junk... 
Junk is the main reason I bought fallout 1st because it became unmanageable dealing with my inventory without sacrificing either junk (which is essential in this game) legendaries, and most of all fun.

Once I bought 1st, stash weight wasn't a problem anymore and I get some atoms to justify paying a subscription fee for in-game storage.

The only reason I feel justified at this point is because of the hours I've played.
Their is content, the map is beautifully crafted and the character builds make it fun to create at least 1 or 2 alt characters.
 
If I could I would leave it a mixed review.

Summary:
Pretty solid game. Like all of the other recent Fallout games, this has devoured a lot of my time over the last few weeks. Not quite as good as the rest of the series (due to compromises made for multiplayer), but still worth playing.

Pro:
- It's more Fallout.
- Visuals are fantastic (trees and grass are still alive here).
- Retains most of the stuff I like about modern Fallout (open world and exploration, allows for a solo/stealth/sniper gameplay style).
- Junk-based crafting system is the best of the series so far.
- Survival-lite mechanics (hunger, thirst, rad management, disease) are interesting without being tedious.
- Base-building subsystem is quite fun (I never bothered in Fallout 4, but it's more interesting when other people can stumble across your work in the middle of the wasteland).
- Multiplayer is gently encouraged, but completely optional (so far). I turned off zone voice chat and just admire the different player bases when I stumble across them. I occasionally do the global group events.
- The number of players per server instance is very limited, so the world still feels appropriately deserted.

Con:
- Some of the travel feels deliberately stretched to extend playtime.
- Fast-travel is now discouraged by charging caps. This feels a little immersion-breaking and is annoying. You can fast-travel back to Vault 76 or your camp for free, however.
- Server hopping is kind of jarring -- each login puts you on a new (arbitrary) server with different state for spawned monsters and items. Your player location is also shifted around (seemingly at random), I assume this is so that you are a safe distance from any respawns, since world-state continues to change without you. But it feels very disorienting (especially if you logged out inside your base).",1592188176,1592188176,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,340,12,6386,0,2839,1595114068

It has come a long way since then.

While I'm not nearly as ventured as plenty of the other active players ingame, I feel I've played enough to form a full opinion on the game.

Wastelanders was really the update this game needed, the roadmap looks promising, and the game is going in the right direction.

Fallout 76 is still plagued by frustrating bugs, and general jank. Quest markers at time not appearing wouldn't be a big deal, if the NPCs would actually describe what you're supposed to do. You can place fast travel markers in the claimable workshops that other players can try to claim, engaging in PVP, but you cannot place these same Fast Travel Markers in your player owned CAMP, and the default location you fast travel to your CAMP at can be very frustrating depending on the area you set up in.

The player stash limit has to be the singular worst feeling designed thing I've encountered in a game where resource farming, building, character growth, and exploration are the key points of the experience.

While I've only been following for a few weeks it seems to me that Bethesda barely listens to the community that keeps their game afloat. Bugs I've found reports of spanning back over a YEAR have not been addressed or acknowledged.

The end game grinding at this point seems to consist of, doing 1 legitimate daily for the prominent factions to farm rep, going to the Nukezones when they drop, The Encryptid Event, and just general Event Grinding for a special trade-in currency (think Grand Companies and FATEs from FF14)

While weapon and armor condition do return, it is largely irrelevant due to how cheap it is to maintain them. 

It feels like a fairly genuine current era Fallout experience, aside from them trying to sell convenience back to you.

68,Fallout 76,70757036,english,"This game had so much potential, its enough that you can imagine what this game could have been if they'd actually put the effort in to make it a real fallout title (i.e. an overarching story line with meaningful impact). 

I purchased the game post-Wastelanders, so all my experience with it is based on that content. I would say it makes it somewhat serviceable if you are a diehard fan of the fallout setting, it definitely has the right look and feel to get immersed. It's just that you spawn into the game without any goal, so if you want to make your own way in the world then this may be fine for you. 

Basically, imagine fallout 4 except you just spawn as a random NPC without the main story line motivating you to explore and learn about your surroundings, that is the essence of this game. You can explore and find some somewhat interesting things, and you'll be given plenty of objectives to do along the way but your only real goal here is character progression in the MMO sense, and unfortunately it is a pretty boring grind with very few interesting rewards.

Also personally I don't think the game benefits from being online at all, actually really kills the immersion running into other players, especially when you are slowly exploring an area and other people come running in with their ridiculous outfits getting all up in your face. It also (at least in my experience) has noticeable lag when you're shooting between the shot and damage registering so its nowhere near as satisfying as it should be.

I won't even mention the atom store and fallout first, it just makes me sick.

Even though I do not recommend, I'll probably keep playing for a bit since as I mentioned if you love the setting and are just desperate for fallout content (and that applies to me) you can get that here. But I feel dirty for even paying the base game given the state of it, and the fact they are constantly holding their hand out asking for more money while you play is very odious.I just hope I can at least get my moneys worth out of the base cost, and that's really the best you can hope for.

I was a massive fan of Fallout 4. I fell in love with the world and the NPC's and I put a lot of hours into that game. I modded the hell out of my game too (being able to modify a game was new to me at the time, it still blows my mind today). I loved Fallout 4 so much I even bought and played all previous Fallout games too (yes New Vegas was amazing).

When Fallout 76 launched it received a LOT of negative press and I have to admit I was influenced by the hate. One of the things I loved about Fallout 4 the most was the NPC’s and to find out that Fallout 76 wasn’t going to have NPC’s really put the nail in the coffin for me. Recently I somehow learned that Bethesda was introducing NPC’s to Fallout 76. The game was available for purchase on Steam, discounted too, so I pulled the trigger.

My initial thoughts: I felt like I was playing Fallout 4 again. Same graphics (not a huge leap from Fallout 4), same janky gun play (coming from way over a thousand hours in Destiny 2 the gun play in Fallout was never going to be great). I instantly missed the theme song from Fallout 4 when launching the game, but the radio still works, and that awesome Fallout 4 vibe of being alone and playing the radio whilst roaming the map was still there.

I started doing the NPC questline and before I knew it I was hooked. So hooked that I stopped playing Destiny 2 all-together and Fallout 76 is now my main game. Within a few weeks I got 2 characters to the level 50+ end game, and both builds are worlds apart. One a bloodied stealth sniper, the other a full health melee build. And speaking of builds, the new perk system is awesome (so too the mutations) and working on a min maxed build to suit my playstyle has been a really rewarding process.

The community seems pretty active, and I’ve spent a lot of time watching great guides on YouTube and checking out other people’s builds on Reddit.

A week ago I decided to subscribe to a 1 month trial of Fallout 1st (mainly for the New Vegas ranger outfit tbh), but the benefits from Fallout 1st have changed the game for me somewhat. Being able to store unlimited junk has lifted my stash bloat and I find myself now picking up ALL the junk. Being able to use the somewhat annoying suitcase method to transfer items from character to character makes levelling new characters almost too easy (buying cheap serums then passing them on to alts, also passing on weapons from farming runs to alts to sell for caps). It all feels very pay to win, and giving up the service once my trial month runs out might be a tough decision.

I've got the bug. I’ve just managed to influence a few of my mates to also buy the game and we’ve just started playing as a crew via private server. Here's hoping they also get the bug!",1592087855,1592087855,TRUE,3,1,0.55184257,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,89,37,51803,395,14012,1602051508

- storage limit is really low.
- vendors share caps and limit is 1400 caps/day only. futhermore vendors recieve only 1/4 of spent caps when you buy something, so do not expect to sell lots of stuff too.

Bethesda made it the most painful way possible: you already enjoyed the game and invested some time on it (yes there are lots of cool stuff there to have fun) and suddenly you get hit by storage limits. 
Oh you also can make bulk resources (like bulk steel, bulk oil, bulk aluminum etc when you scrapped lots of junk) to save some space in your storage and delay the inevitable to make it even more painful.
and finally you figured out that your storage is really-really full of bulk resources you cannot sell(because of vendors' caps limits) and aids and quite good armors and weapons and ammo for these weapons and you are hopelessly overencumbered like 700  of 320. 
so either you are ready to walk with turtle speed being forever ovecrumbered or deal with it by buying subscription. pretty simple.
 
actually the only reason to buy Fallout 1st subsription is unlimited storage. other features of Fallout 1st are quite useless: private worlds? who needs them anyway in that way Bethesda delivered it? limit of 8 players is quite low for ""private server"" and your server will go down as soon as you leave the world. so in case you decide to run a world with your friends do not expect them to play without you(also you can be disconnected for idleness and you server will go down as well). oh well, the survival tent can probably be useful. but does it worth it? Hell no.

And bugs. Bugs and glitches are everywhere:
 - annoying freezes when you use/stop using some workbench, break bobby pin while lockpicking
 - absolutely annoying freeze when you are loaded to location and you can see everything around but cannot move. this feeling of being ""paralysed"" is really bad thing.
 - hell as many glitches while using UI including switching tabs in pip-boy, hotkeys for favorite weapons(so nice feeling when you cannot use stimpack in combat for example), menu on map. in some places on UI there are labels to press TAB to go back but you need to press ESC instead. 
 - ""waiting response from server"" for several seconds almost any time you leave terminal while hacking.
 - why do you show map anytime you close pipboy? <sarcasm>super useful while combat.</sarcasm>
 - monsters that cannot be killed (they do not attack you though)
 - sometimes you need to press some button several times to switch weapons
 - almost any automatic weapon has a bug with remaining ammo and starts to reload it when it is not empty yet (like you have 7/20 bullets and reload it instead of shooting). sometimes you can shoot even if you see 0/0 ammo on UI.
 - bugs with weight calculations - like your are overencumbered when you are not. and cannot fast travel because of that.
 - bugs with quests. like you get 11 of 10 commendations needed for enclave quest and cannot finish quest because of that. relogging worked for me with this case.

+Great Main story
FO76 story is interesting to say the least. both wastelanders and the original FO76 are both quite interesting and will keep you interested until the endgame
+ The world
the world in FO76 is hands down one of Bethesda best work when it comes to the exploration. if you liked exploring the world of Skyrim you will very much enjoy FO76 exploration
+The Community
The community in fallout 76 is amazing to say the least. people help out new players and are very welcoming and friendly.
+ Events Fallout 76 has some really fun and unique events each with their own gimmicks and such. some do get stail after a couple times doing them but none the less still fun.

+Enemies
The enemies in fallout 76 are incredibly varied and interesting. from mutated toads to sheepsquatches this game does not disappoint in that department

[b] Cons [b]
- performance 
this game is poorly optimized and just runs poorly.
-bugs
Fallout 76 is not as buggy as some people say, but there is bugs. nothing game breaking.  90% of the bugs in this game are either problems with the AI or graphical bugs

The AI in this game are dumb as rocks. 
-endgame
 as of right now the endgame in fallout 76 isn't that good. no raids, nothing really interesting to do after level 50. FO76 endgame is basically a endless grind for legendary weapons,faction rep, and gold bullion. it seems this might be fixed in future updates, but as of right now its not that good. maybe if you enjoy a grind you might enjoy the endgame but for me its no.

[b] Conclusion [b]
Fallout 76 is a fun and enjoyable game but does still have issue. i can see this game becoming really good in future if they fix the endgame which seems to be happening. i would recommend it

90,Fallout 76,70694237,english,"I first got this game in May of 2020, and so far I've really enjoyed it, despite whatever history it's had. 

The atmosphere and world:
Appalachia is a beautiful place with lots of really detailed locations and secrets. It doesn't always run well, but it hits that false nostalgia other games in the series have accomplished if not even better.
This is the first game since the first two in the Fallout series that actually hits the vibe the universe is supposed to have. The first two games are post-post apocalyptic and then Fallouts 3-4 revert to a more destitute wasteland, while Fallout 76 happens so close after the bombs dropped that the destruction makes sense. It's a really dense map with tons of unmarked locations and quaint stories scattered throughout. Lore wise I'm confused about a lot of points but I can look past it because the experience is nice.

Gameplay:
Combat feels a lot like other Fallout games, that is to say clunky and kind of bad but that's sort of the point I guess. Because it's in a persistent MMO world (where you'll probably be playing solo) you can't pause or slow down anything with VATS or your Pipboy, but these handicaps get made up for with some forgiving mechanics like a lot more health and lots of survivalist perks. You'll be doing most of your combat in small or medium sized arenas (there's a good deal of variation, but most of the time it boils down to smaller areas) where enemies close the gap really quickly. When you get hit, you stop moving for a second so basically the game becomes a cycle: enter stealth when exploring and get a headshot on an unsuspecting enemy with a long range gun, if that doesn't get the kill, shoot and miss repeatedly as they charge at you, struggle to run away while frantically switching to a shotgun or smg and then getting hit 3-20 times before you can manage to land a single hit. 

Crafting and progression:
This looks like the most suspicious part of the game so far. Carry weight is an issue, like any RPG these days, and you constantly have to go back and forth between your base and worktables in locations to scrap loot you've found or store extra weapons and upgrades. Your stash has a limited capacity that I am quickly maximizing, even after storing only things I think are worth keeping (clothes, one extra copy of some weapons, power armor, and scrap materials). Weapons and armor degrade pretty quickly and eventually break. So far I haven't found a single repair kit, which can also be purchased as a microtransaction from the in-game shop. This means you'll be constantly switching out gear, but it's easy to find good weapons which makes repairing a luxury rather than a necessity. 

TL;DR:
Really cool world that feels unique but authentically Fallout, combat that makes me want to vomit sometimes but keeps the game tense, and an inaccessible crafting system that encourages people to have no attachments to gear (or purchase microtransactions).",1591998679,1591998679,TRUE,4,0,0.547786593,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,153,32,2302,0,1610,1596514517

I have joked that I turned the game into Deathclaw Valley  or Mutant Animal  Crossing because of the farming, cooking, and maintenance chores I do at my camp before I actually go out and adventure. Other times I will barely be at camp at all. I enjoy having the flexibility that Bethesda has built into so many games.

9,Fallout 76,70648545,english,"Single player review / Wasteland edition / Fallout First.

I was a huge Bethesda fan. The handling of Fallout 76 really put a dent in the trust in that company. Fallout 76 was released at least a year to early. Bugs galore. No human NPCs, only robots. The story told by ""holotapes"" and text/terminals. 

After 18 months with patches and 3 huge content updates it is starting to shape to a decent game.  But the base game is still to grindy. To really enjoy the game you need Fallout First that is an extra 100 dollars / year.¨

Fallout 76 is about loot / building stuff and the base game is crippled with a small storage for the stuff you collect in game. Since your character can carry a set amount if weight, you have to travel to your camp and off load the stuff to a limited space storage. Not fun.

With Fallout first you get 4 huge gameplay enhancing features that make the game playable. 
1) Unlimited scrap space. The base game have a really small stash box. 
2) Survival tent. This is almost like a ""quick save"" since you can put the tent almost anywhere you want and if you die in game you can respawn in the tent.  The tent also have a scrap box so you dont have to travel to camp. Fast travel in game also cost caps but is free to CAMP and the tent.
3) stashbox / sleeping bag / cooking in the survival tent.  Running out of ammo? Just go to your stash and switch weapon / ammo type in a tent you have placed near the hotspot.
4) each month you get 1650 Atoms to buy stuff in their ingame store.  1650 Atoms would cost about 15 dollars so its a ""bargain"" if you like cosmetics.

and last with first: you get a private world. Perfect for classic solo Fallout playing and with wastelanders they have handcrafted storyline that is really good.

the bad gameplay wise.
Still buggy and its really irritating to have to replay huge chunks of a mission because of bugs/server issues.

Since its a ""live service game"": Events that spawn again and again and again. Doing the same mission several times a day is not fun.

Graphics: Gorgeous HDR WideP3 colors of you have rig / monitor that supports it. HDR is really showing off bright colors and dynamic range compared to the SD / Compressed colors.

14,Fallout 76,70642256,english,"I have a lot more hours in this game than this says having leveled several toons up in the hundreds on other platforms. I have a love hate thing going with this hot dumpster fire of a game. I am a huge fan of Elder scrolls titles and Fallout titles. They are my favorite games by far. I knew going in there would be bugs (or as our lord and savior would call them ""features"")
   This game was incomplete upon release. They literally left out NPCs and called it a ""feature"".  They've fixed that with the wastelanders update and it's improved the game immensely. It still runs like a potato. As of the time of this review duping and inventory glitches are running rampant. The game is overall pretty buggy with lots of falling through the map and goofy physics ""features"". Some of it's pretty hilarious though so I can't get to mad here.  I could go on.  Now the big problem for me is the Fallout 1st subscription. It simply costs too much. I would look at tuning the price point a bit. I understand they don't want to give it away even though I don't like it. 100 to 150 dollars a year is just too high. Way off. For what you get I would suggest halving the price or adding more value. There is a premium shop but for the most part it's cosmetic stuff with a couple exceptions. You can earn the premium currency in the game for free so I don't think it's too bad. Some would disagree. They could fix this problem entirely for me if they offered a way to pay for the Fallout 1st with  the premium currency you earn in game, even if it was grindy. 
   Now the good stuff. 
   You will be hard pressed to find a game with a better community. In game and in forums there is a sense of comradery. Sure there's toxic elements and griefing and blah blah butt you can easily circumvent all of it by not running around with a giant bag of junk or server hopping. Bam problem solved. When you die you drop your colostomy bag and it has all your junk you've been scrambling around in ruins like a chem fiend trying to collect and now anybody that stumbles across it can take it. So just stash it and you're golden. You can die all you want in ppve and pvp and it doesn't matter as long as you don't lose a bunch of junk or you can go back and get your colostomy bag.  If somebody is particularly obnoxious you can just block them. I actually like some of this stuff especially trap bases. they are hilarious. Just my opinion. Be aware of your surroundings in this game. Some people are about that Raider Life. 
   New players will be taken care of. Just waive if you see me out in the wastes and if I've got stuff to spare on me I'll drop something. A lot of players are like this. Drop by my camp and feel free to sample the punch bowl if I'm not there;) All the Black Lives Matter stuff in people's camps all over the place gave me the warm fuzzies. I've seen some pretty racist things in other games and it's not completely missing here but it's definitely not the overall climate by any means. Really cannot say enough good things about this game's community. 
   Gameplay is Fallout 4 but tighter in my opinion somehow. Hip firing feels better I think and It's my go to, even with snipers. Love a good hip fired head shot from down range, mhmm tasty. the Vats mechanic is awesome. I don't really think they could have done it better considering this is an online game. You can also play completely without it if you'd like.
    Exploration is a strong point. There is a lot to do in this game. I hope you don't mind fetch quests because they will be your bread and butter for a good portion of the game. The locations and biomes are very well done and that variety goes a long way towards keeping things interesting. Some areas I would go so far as to call fantastic. Masterful video game artistry. Crank up that field of view a bit to get the sense of scale. It will also keep your eyes from being drawn to some of the potato textures. On a side note I have to say something about the mountains in this game, and there are a lot of them. This game has my favorite mountains of any open world game I've ever played. Not only do they look great (until your'e right up on them mind you) but once you start to interact with them as you explore the map you'll find you can almost always climb them to get wherever you're going. They are tiered and you will find all kinds of cool little encounters in the nooks and crannies. Just kind of run back and forth when you hit a spot you can't jump up and usually you'll find a low spot or a hidden ravine of something. It seems very well thought out to me.
  Graphics are tuned up Fallout 4. They get the job done but they are dated. My Fallout 4 and Skyrim graphics are on par if not better than any new triple A title but with the help of mods. Mods are the only reason I'm still playing those older games. I think I have screenshots up if you want to take a look. This game looks pretty damn good with a reshade (i prefer Optimum Reshade on the Nexus [Mod At Your Own Risk especially if you do Nuclear Winter]) Otherwise I would just say as a whole the graphics are adequate while individual things can be hit or miss. Edit: the screenshots are on my other account nakedman or atraeon.
   Crafting is a quirky blast in my opinion and I include C.A.M.P. building here. Farming mats can be a chore but just check for resources online like Mappalachia and it becomes easily manageable. If you know the rug glitch go nuts. Again server hopping is an integral part of this game. In my experience you load back in relatively quickly. Collecting plans and recipes and tons of other stuff may become an obsession. Or you can pretty much ignore it completely if you want. If you need a gun made or tinkered with come see me. You bring the mats and I'll do it just for the xp. Plenty of other players are like this. Beware of Raiders though.
   I gave the game a thumbs up but It's definitely not perfect. Don't take my word for it and then be mad if your high level toon glitches out and you lose all your god roll legendaries or whatever in game disaster is plaguing the wastes of West Virginia at the time. I say it's worth the gamble. I've had a lot of fun but that's just me.

22,Fallout 76,67348306,english,"The Key issue with this game is, they want YOU to Pay to be a beta tester and if you complain THEY will remove you as a player and censor you.

Well they fixed the game but the actual company is actually the enemy of its player base and they devote all their time to censoring you on the forums or trying to trick you into spending money for cosmetics by posting photos of items in the atom store that wont actually come with the bundle you buy unless you read the fine print.

On the forums they Actively protect hackers and cheaters, if you post a screen shot of someone hacking and cheating in game, they will ban you or give you warnings.

There have been direct users images posted to the forums of discord chats where Bethesda actually gives Atoms and pay white hat hackers and dupers who find their exploits of this out of date engine.

if you call them out on this you can be banned and warned and removed from their forums and the game.

This game is a lie, yes they fixed it with wastelanders but it's still 76 and after you go through the content it's just a grind like any other MMO with no reward. They will continue trying to trick you into giving them money and they will continue to offer NO support for their game or its engine.

Their forums are Managed by communist bots and cycle off a pattern off user reports of anyone shaming hacking.

Bethesda  protects its hackers.
You can be banned for criticizing their cosmetic ATOM items with jokes like red rocket cooler if you say ""The cooler has sixteen times the detail dude, have you tried nuclear winter?""

The Cooler item you pay 5$ for will require more camp budget and they JUST decreased it.

THEY OFFER NO customer SUPPORT. If you post customer support questions on their forums on your issues THEY WILL actively censor you.

If you complain about their antagonistic customer support on the forums they WILL warn and ban you.

Cancel your Fallout 1st if you already own it.

Enjoying the game overall, much prefer single player Fallout games (3,4,NV), I only started playing with wasterlanders content release.
Pluses and minuses with the forced online aspects.
-Cannot pause the game, this is simple but can be annoying
-Knobheads whose fun is to be annoying (although I have seen very few of this)
+Most other players have been helpful rather than annoying. I still treat as a single player play-through so far.
-/+The constant daily/event quests can be annoying especially when just trying to get through the mission. But I understand it is meant to be 'end game'
-Limited stash space is super annoying. I see more stash space is behind a paywall.

Overall I am enjoying the game so far (~50 hours played). Fans of Fallout 4 should enjoy the game, despite its core differences.",1589501211,1591837864,FALSE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,56,10,7456,0,3104,1599212563

36,Fallout 76,69642118,english,"Despite some bugs, I find the game to be enjoyable. Personally, I think that since the controversial launch, I see that there have been quite a bit of improvements. There are dailies, events, quests, all sorts of content to enjoy. Crafting is similar to fallout 4, you will literally have to scavenge for mats as in find junk like coffee pots for example and then scrap them to get materials. With this game, you'll really want to be prepared as in weapons and armor in good condition, food and drinks, healing items, and boosts if you choose to use boosts, but optional. If you ain't prepared when venturing around the map, do expect things to be challenging, maybe you'll die quite a bit as I have. You can get infected with a variety of diseases and they all have their owns effects such as draining your hunger bar meaning you prob will be starving real fast and need food for example. As for bugs, there are some bugs like respawn bugs and enemies not attacking even when you engage them in combat. 76 is not as buggy as back during the controversial launch months. You'll also want to be careful with perks you choose as they will relate to  builds you choose. For example, I went w/ a shotgun and melee hybrid build. One issue I have most so far is that u can only exchange 150 scrips a day when scripping legendaries, you can get more through events and quests. Also, you have a limit of 1000 scripts, be careful and wise when getting the legendaries you want. Anyways, if you like survival games with challenges, then I do recommend this game.

58,Fallout 76,70528038,english,"Everyone has expectations when it comes to fallout games,, whether you’ve been a fan since the original game, or you found the games after bethesda took over with the third game.. Certain things remain the same, you expect a good open world game, you expect lots of content, lots of quest and lots of atmospheric ambience.   Fallout 76 is really a tale of a game trying to live up to expectations while carving it’s own niche and trying to get Fallout fans, MMO fans and people who just like good games all together under the same roof.. 

It should be said,, Fallout 76 is far from perfect, a game which fails to live up to it’s predecessors name, while at the same time being “pretty good” as a game in it’s own right..  

Gameplay - if you were like me in the previous installments of Fallout, you were an everyday man, someone who was great at everything.. Sneaking, melee, ranged whatever the case we could do it..  Gone are those days,, in 76, the SPECIAL’s, and Perks work slightly differently..  Every level you up to level 50 you gain a Special point and a Perk (or pack of perk cards).  The special you assign gives you additional points you can use to activate your perk cards..   So if you have a 12 strength, you’ll be able to use cards worth up to 12 points..  

Perk cards are the normal perks you would have been able to choose from while playing the original game..  These cards can have a cost of 1 - 5 points, depending on how ranked up the card is.. All the good stuff is there,, + % to dmg with certain weapons, reload speeds, carryweight reductions, etc etc etc... oh yeah and Lock picking and Hacking as well..   This was kind of where I was a little frustrated..  The general idea that Locking picking and Hacking can be locked away requiring cards to use is a little...  Well DUMB.   These are two core mechanics in all the fallout games..  I’d have much rather seen it be based on a skill which you could increase as you picked locks and hacked computers..

GRIND.. The game is a massive Grind,, whether you’re grinding to finish up daily challenges, or grinding for material to repair your equipment, grinding to level up, grinding faction or grinding for plans (crafting items)  It seems like you’re always grinding something.  Talking about grinding wouldn’t be complete if you didn’t talk about some of the major obstacles that are set up to prevent you from having the most fun in the game..

Storage or Stash space,, without a subscription to Fallout 1st, you’re stash box is limited to 800 pounds.. All things considered 800 pounds fills up really fast, with the way you’re breaking down equipment and storing it to be used in basemaking, outpost making and or equipment repair.. To sum it up before I subscribed to Fallout 1st, I played a total of about 8 hours and my stashbox was at over 750 pounds,, that was building materials, ammo and a few choice weapons I wanted to hold onto while deciding what path I wanted to take..   I knew that wasn’t going to be nearly enough so I subscribed to Fallout 1st..

Fallout 1st gives you access to an unlimited stash box, which allows you to stash away all your building and crafting materials.. While the unlimited space doesn’t work for weapons and clothing, healing and food items, etc etc etc, it does give you the ability to not count crafting items which can get quite heavy.  It also provides you with a tent you can use on the fly, which gives access to your unlimited stash box, normal stash box, cooking fire and most importantly a free fast travel point you can put anywhere..  While not pay 2 win in and of itself, the tent provides a really useful benefit which can’t be replicated by any other means outside of paying for a subscription..  

Merchants are also limited to 1400 caps per day which are a general pool used between all merchants in the game.  This is another limiting aspect of the game which maybe or may not be unnecessary..	With me with in 2 hours of the new cap limit for the day being active, I’m already at my max by selling purified water, and other items which are just taking up space in my inventory..  This could be an issue or not.. It depends..

I could go on an on about the game and it’s limitations or gameplay mechanics which are kind of either poorly thought out or down right limiting to the player, BUT...  I don’t have unlimited space or unlimited time,, so we’ll move along to one more issue that needs to be touched on... GLITCHES, considering it’s a beth game, you’re going to have glitches.. While generally the glitches in Fallout 76 are no where near the size or scope that hits the single player Beth games, they are there,, headless enemies, enemies spawning under my base and destroying it from the inside out, Vats which says 95% chance to hit, and then trying 6 or 7 times and getting nothing.  General quest bugs and glitches... etc etc etc..

Pro’s  
Fun but limited gameplay
Fallout universe with people, albeit nobody who wants to group
Epic quest and enemies (albeit not clear enough on quest difficulty)

Con’s
Voice communication only,, no text
Finding friends in game to group with can be difficult 100 hours before my first group
Limitations on stash almost forcing someone to subscribe to Fallout 1st

Recommendation 

In spite of the flaws this game has,, I found myself playing it for well over 100 hours at this point, and enjoying most of my time.. It’s been a great distraction to all the stuff going on in the world..  BUT, if you go in expecting Fallout you’ll be slightly disappointed, this is like a empty shell of a fallout game.. Lacking things which make the single player game amazing.. While the graphics, and lighting, and sounds of a fallout game are there.. The world is empty of NPC’s, (sure a few exist, but not nearly enough).  For an MMO the map is rather small, and the game features massive grinds, especially for armor repair mats.

To sum it up,, I’d recommend this game if you’re ok with the idea of paying for a subscription, and love previous Fallout games.   If you’re ok with the fact the game isn’t packed with content yet, and will likely leave you frustrated at some points..",1591695516,1591695540,TRUE,15,0,0.564787924,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,15234,171,20231,850,8554,1602050074

83,Fallout 76,69080478,english,"Note: As someone who has not played the Pre-Wastelanders version of Fallout 76, I have not experienced the previous versions to compare this one to. 

[u]Only one very big negative:[/u]
I don't really like the prospect of multiplayer in Fallout but I went into this anyway since I knew you didn't *have* to play with people. The first thing that happened when I left the vault was getting pestered by some level 80 guy who proceeded to constantly wack me with a hammer. It was annoying as all get-out and I immediately quit. I went to figure out if I could play in my own world and lo-and-behold I figured out that you indeed can! But there was a massive catch!

You need to purchase Fallout 1st to experience your own private server. Now this would be an immediate negative from me, and it still is to be honest, but since I paid for the cheaper version of the game, getting one month of Fallout 1st didn't seem too bad since both the game and 1st still did not come to the full price of a newly released AAA game. In all seriousness though, having to pay monthly for a single player (or private server with friends) version of the game seems backwards. I know this was not originally their intent to have single player worlds but I bet if the Wastelanders version of the game came out first with its own single player option, it would have been well received and more people would have purchased the game.

[u]The good stuff:[/u]
[list]
[*]There are a couple of lengthy and enjoyable main quest paths to follow. The main original quest line and the new Wastelanders quest line. Eventually you can side with two different factions.
[*]There are a ton of side quests and repeatable daily quests and events to take on for additional rewards.
[*]All of the classic Fallout looting/scavenging random buildings and locales are still a thing. You can still find the bobbleheads, magazines, and 'treasure chests' like from Fallout 3, NV, and 4.
[*]You can craft your own camp, and base within the camp, that you can store and move around the map without having to re-create anything. Personally, I don't care for building bases but it’s there for those that like it, and it looks more in-depth than Fallout 4.
[*]The pull-up map itself looks so much better than previous Fallout games. I honestly hope they use this style of pull-up map for future Fallout's since its much cleaner than the 'pip-boy' version of previous games.
[*]The level-up system is cool. You choose a perk card on each level up and depending on how many points you have in your SPECIAL skills is how many of those perk cards you have in that skill. If you get another of the same card, you can rank them up by combining them for a more powerful version.
[*]Survival system is added where you need to manage food and water. This is actually really fun. Food and water don't deplete too fast to where it’s annoying but they do deplete enough to where you need to check yourself from time to time.
[*]There is a ton of lore spread throughout the world. A house or building off the beaten path will have holo-tapes, notes, or terminals and sometimes even a quest involved in that area that gives more background about previous lives there.
[*]Graphics are good enough for me, especially the natural environments, like the mountains and forests.
[*]The music surprised me. I did not expect this quality of music in this game to be more enjoyable than previous Fallout games. Inon Zur really stepped up his game. Some of the ambient outside/environment music is top notch and is perfect when just doing the usual 'preparing in camp' stuff.
[*]Some crazy memorable surprises. For example, I went into a 'lower level' building that I have been in before so that I could collect junk for screws. I expected the usual low-level scorcher enemies, which I picked off with ease as I scavenged around, when suddenly out of the blue I am attacked by a high-level wendigo creature that gave me a run for my money. Luckily, I was able to finish it off and it gave me some really good stuff that I was not expecting to receive when going on this junk run. That was a nice surprise and will put me on my guard as I check out other lower level places.
[/list]

[u]The bad or annoying stuff:[/u]
[list]
[*]Needing a Fallout 1st (subscription) to play in your own world or privately with close friends.
[*]Some bugs that need working. For example, when indoors, my view/camera will just suddenly flick in a random direction a little. Like there is debris under my mouse laser but this is the only game it happens in. Thankfully it’s not all the time. Another example is your base turrets will go haywire and just shoot at nothing until you leave and load back into the area. Or some enemies, even special ones like legendaries will just stop in their tracks and stare at you while you mow them down. This happened a couple times so far and I felt like I was cheating but I just accepted it since I wasn't attempting to cheat.
[*]Spongy enemies. At levels higher than 15, it seems many enemies (not all) just take a ton of ammo to kill, even from weapons you think are strong and weapons in their level range. I'm sure better perks, weapon upgrades, and leveling up will help but this is the first Fallout game I played where just a few enemies soak up entire clips worth of ammo even with headshots. Thankfully the game provides a lot of ammo to be found and scrap that can be converted to ammo. Loot plenty of gunpowder and lead because you will need it.
[*]If you want to stick with just the main quest, you will get severely out-leveled by harder enemies even early on in the game. The game is built for you to do side stuff, events, and some dailies to level up and get better stuff before continuing on it seems. If you want to just experience the main quests, you will need to work for it and do side stuff too. This is in the grey area for me, but it could be a positive for some.
[*]The daily quests seem to always want to pop back up in my pip boy every time I load back into the game. I know they are repeatable but it’s odd that ones I already did seem to want to pop back up constantly. I need to reject them each time I log in to clean the list of quests in the side view. I thought they only popped back in when you were near them, not clear across the map.
[*]Screws are notoriously difficult to get in this game and most guns and some armors need them, like lots of them. I thought adhesives were bad but it’s really the screws. Screw the screws.
[*]The last quest for the Main quest line is a a little messed up and tedious. Makes you hunt down a ton of codes but in reality you can just look something up online and bypass most of it and then go through an extremely long ammo sucking 'dungeon' for the final payoff. The 'Final Boss' is optional and its almost required to do online with help. This is the point I went online and it went surprisingly well so it wasn't too bad. Just a shame they cant scale it down for a single player experience.

I tried to like it, I really did. In some ways, I do really like this game. HOWEVER. The stupid, annoying and downright broken things about this game WAY out weigh the good. Combat in this game, whether it be with players or just enemies, is the jankiest thing I've seen in a AAA game in a long ass time and my main gripe. In a game so built around combat, it should be so much better than it is. The bullets seem to be incredibly inconsistent, at times they seem to just pass through enemies, or hit them and not do any damage. Other times. enemies just seem to lunge at you at incredible speed and pass through you, while also hitting you. I'm almost 100% sure that this is due to terrible latency from the servers, which is saddening coming from Bethesda. Enemies also have wayyyy too much health for my liking as well, especially due to the scarcity of ammo and how much it costs to craft. That isn't a huge deal but it adds to just making the game frustrating. THAT word is basically what sums up this game for me. Frustrating.

I'm level 18 after about 12 hours of just main quest lines and the VERY rare side quest. I hit a wall where I can't fight anything above level 35. This is fine, just takes a couple hours of grinding. 
The looting and gameplay is very fallout-esque. Vats is different, but easy to use. I'd recommend this game to anyone who even remotely enjoys fallout 3, new vegas, or 4.

49,Fallout 76,70322093,english,"Alright. Time to write my review of this game. I have purchased the game itself, the Wastelanders packs and ran with Fallout 1st for 2 months, and even tried some of the Atom Shop content. And I can say here and now, it was not worth the money I payed for this. There was some enjoyment I found in this game, but the shear number of bugs still in the game outweigh the joy I found. 

Bugs like feral ghouls glitching with their deaths which makes their textures remain in the normal standing animation while their textureless bodies lay on the floor invisible somewhere (I have lost 3 legendary items to this bug alone). 
Lockpicking and Hacking can sometimes bug your game too by somehow disabling Keyboard and Moose input, or just locking you into a terminal and making it so you are stuck there with only the ability to view terminal entries and you can't get out of the terminal at all. 
Non Legendary enemies somehow going from about to die in my next attack back up to full health, forcing you to expend more time and resources taking them down.
And of course the exploits that I stumbled upon by accident while playing the game. I will not get into those as the ones I found were pretty minor, and Bethesda has bad reputation for banning people who have used an exploit 

The Wastelander packs only really added some cosmetic C.A.M.P. items and 2 Power Armor skins which I found not worth the price I paid for them. 
And the Atom Shop items are vastly overpriced, if they cut the price of most of those items down by about 50% it would be better, but still a ways from being worth it. 
Fallout 1st gives you a Scrap Box which allows you to store a limitless number of fully scraped junk which is nice, it also gives you a nice Ranger Cosmetic outfit for those who loved Fallout New Vegas which is obviously part of the appeal they were going for to sell this thing, it also gives you a Survival Tent which allows you to set down a second free fast travel point as well as giving you the ability to stash your loot on the go. And the private servers are nice, as they allow you to play without competition for loot in the area and a good place to avoid griefers which I feel they really need to do better with as I feel that you should not have to pay 13 dollars a month just to avoid them. The emotes are okay, and the 1650 Atoms a month for the 13$ a month price tag makes that a nice investment when the game is playable.

All in all, I cannot recommend this game based on what I have payed for and what I have experienced personally. Thats not to say that its not enjoyable to others, and I have found enjoyment in the Bethesda made Fallout games. But I have played Fallout games since the late 90s when the series started under Interplay and Black-Isle Studios, and so I tend to view the Bethesda games as their own thing altogether apart of the classic games that hold a special place in my heart. And so if you want a Fallout game that is enjoyable, go with Fallout 3 and Fallout 4 if you like the Bethesda made games, go with Fallout, Fallout 2 and Fallout New Vegas if you prefer the Classic games. But on the subject of Fallout 76 on the PC, I recommend not paying for this game. They have fixed a lot of the bugs I have seen in actual gameplay videos online and with Wastelanders they seem to be moving in a positive direction, but the game still suffers from a lot of really bad bugs that can still make the game unplayable. So if you want to experience the Wastelanders content? Just watch lets play videos online. It saves you a lot of money and spares you a lot of pain dealing with these bugs.",1591344620,1591344620,FALSE,3,0,0.524895012,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,235,4,11932,0,11932,1591342190

It's still is very rooted in single-player so if you don't care about grouping with other players it is very optional.

The weapon crafting is still all there and there's a wide variety of weapons and mods to satisfy your weapon/armour/power armour wishes just imagine a super enhanced or modded version of fallout 4 which is a good thing in the end because it still retains the atmosphere and feel of the fallout games..

56,Fallout 76,70311001,english,"I wanted to reserve my judgement until I reached the soft cap. 

The cons: As myself and my friends have noted, you are utterly useless until about level 40. The majority of your game play will be spent feeling like you're trying to shoot through bulletproof glass with nerf darts. The main quest is ENTIRELY fetch missions until you meet the two main factions of the new expansion, the raiders and the settlers. Until that point, I question what on earth the point of the quests were as I would run around doing errands for robots. Rose is the most annoying NPC of all time and you cannot turn off her miserable voice until you complete her lengthy fetch quest line. Ammo for useful weapons is scarce, you'll find yourself with a million .38 bullets when all the dust settles. The crafting costs are a bit too high in my opinion, and you'll often find yourself fast traveling away with 30 desk fans on you for the scrap. The majority of my caps in game were spent fast traveling.

The Pros: the scenery is beautiful. Appalachia is a challenging and rewarding environment to explore. The creatures/enemies you run into are unique and the legendary weapon rewards you can receive are nice gamble. Everything after the overseer, overseen quest feels like a normal fallout game. Despite being an incredibly slow grind, the game is a time sucker in a good way. The in game events are great, especially limited time ones like fasnacht. The building system is VASTLY improved over the clunky fallout 4 building, as is shooting guns. I never felt the need to rely on VATS as the gun mechanics were solid. Launching a nuke is a tedious but satisfying experience.

Overall, the game is an incredibly slow grind filled with tons of exploration and rewards worth grinding for.",1591320064,1591320064,TRUE,1,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,57,5,18575,2085,6676,1601962818
57,Fallout 76,70308997,english,"I stayed away from this game because of the awful reviews, only trying it for the first time a few weeks ago when Bethesda put on that free weekend with the launch of the Wastelanders DLC. I cannot speak for the game in its original state as I never tried that, but what I am playing here I am very much enjoying. Its scratching the same itch that Fallout 4 did. Obviously you can't build as many bases and your base is definitely smaller, but the same gameplay loops are still there. This game does play differently tho (besides the obvious online factor) compared to Fallout 4, carry weight is definitely a factor which definitely makes you plan and manage your resources very closely. Yes the game is made by Bethesda so it does have its share of bugs and glitches here and there. My server connection experience has been great most of the time, I have only dropped once in the 37 hours I played so for my location (SW Ontario) it was fine. 

The online playerbase is really cool. They have a very polite community of people willing to help. I have not experienced any trolls or griefers in the time I've played, the opposite in fact. Lots of people handing out free items to lower levels, giving plans and stuff. Really nice to see!

Yes, there are a lot of assets recycled from Fallout 4, but there is a whole whackload of new stuff too. For someone like me who put hundreds of hours into Fallout 4, this is exactly what I wanted. A whole new world to explore (West Virginia is pretty dope so far!), more of the same but slightly tweaked gameplay loops, the option of multiplayer (you can play the game just fine by yourself but teaming up is a lot of fun).

There's some pretty significant lag, especially since the game starts your graphics settings on ""ultra"". I recommend setting them to Medium if the lag is too much.

This game is similar to fallout 4 with some quality of life improvements and lots of variety. The core gameplay itself works flawlessly (as a fallout fan) and is even more fun with friends. The map is huge and bustling with so many unique and interesting places to discover. The graphics do not differ from fallout 4, but I don't mind it too much. Wastelanders has added an interesting story, riddled with good character, and unique quest segments. The characters can seem a bit stupid sometimes but it's easy to look past that. The bugs. This game is absolutely littered with them. It is easy to look past most of them, but some of them can be a real pain in the ass, and they can even be game-breaking, requiring restarting quests occasionally.

I actually waited more than a year before I even thought of buying the game. I even waited until it was on special. All reviews of the latter since its release were negative. Bugs, crashes, hacks.

Being a Bethesda fan boy and preferring the Elder Scrolls series to that of Fallout, I bought the game and really wondered if it was worth it.

After almost 50 hours of playing in a week, I can tell you that YES, if you are a fan of the series, I recommend it.

The graphics are fine if you consider the age of the Creation Engine. It can be seen that they pushed it to the limits of what it can do. Interestingly, I am able to play the game at 144hz and I have no problem as in FO4.

Another advantage of an old engine like this is that anyone with a potato computer can play the game without any problems.

Another thing of the game is that there are already mods for the textures in the game and to add stuff that makes life easier for the UI. Nothing yet that changes the gameplay of the game or make the game unbalanced, just the aesthetics for now (and it will probably stay that way).

The world is very wide even that sometimes I am a little angry because I have just started playing and I have to walk several minutes to get to the next quest and that is if I do not stop 5 times on the way because of all the POI. I also won an achievement for 100 discovered places and if I check the map, I don't even think I have found half of the places that exists.

ONE MAJOR CON:
It still crashes! Not as much as FO3 and much less than FO4 and SkyrimSE but when it crashes, it crashes and not just a little. In one week, I had 3 CTDs, not so bad for 50 hours of play when you think about it for a Bethesda game, but I have never seen crashes like that with another game. The first time, I had to restart my PC because one of my screen stopped responding. The second time it was my computer that decided to restart itself and there is nothing worse than a complete system shutdown. My heart has practically stopped beating! On the other hand, the third time, just a small CTD signed Bethesda (as I am used to having them).

ABOUT SUBSCRIPTION:
Many people see the FO1st subscription service as a scam. Personally, it's pretty much the same as in Elder Scrolls Online, that is to say that in addition to having exclusive costumes and other stuff that are not game-breaking, they give 1650 Atoms per month of subscription to spend in the cash store. And having a stash with infinite space for junk is really nice, but a person who doesn't pick up everything he sees, will have no problem with space. And you have to pay the servers and the updates and the support they give. Nothing is free in life. Personally I have no problem with it and I am already subscribed.

And I have never used a repair kit because I always have the junk to repair my equipment and even if someone buys repair kit, there is absolutely nothing they can do except repair their equipment. And the equipment hardly ever breaks.

And I don't feel special or privileged because I have a FO1st subscription. The game is 100% playable without.

CONCLUSION:
If you are a fan of the Fallout series, I recommend the game to you. Personally, I really enjoy playing and the game just gets better over time. Maybe they should have waited another year before releasing the game to give their team time to polish it but when you have to meet deadlines and you have the shareholders with expectations, it doesn't give a lot of flexibility.

0,Fallout 76,70208025,english,"After 100+ hours, i'd be lying if I said I hadn't had any fun with this game.  I've had a lot of fun with it actually and I hope to have more fun with it in the future.

I'll keep this shortish and sweetish.  The game has improved a lot since I played it originally and I would recommend it if you can get it for a decent price (30 or lower).  THIS is what Fallout 76 SHOULD have began as, not what it originally was when it released.

To touch on a few things, FO76 felt really meaningless a year ago.  You were doing stuff for the sake of doing stuff and nothing more, in my opinion.  It was Fallout 4 but without a heart or soul.  Nowadays, there is finally some kind of driving force pushing you forward and I really appreciate that (although it took a while to get).  It's kept me going for over 100 hours.

My biggest  issue with this game isn't the atomic shop.  There really isn't anything in there that is essential at all.  If you only get one thing, it should be a scrap bot that you place at your camp to collect junk for you while you are away.  You can earn a lot of atoms just by playing the game and i've amassed well over a couple thousand without giving bethesda an extra cent (and will continue to not give them more money).

Nuclear Winter isn't my biggest issue either, but it is absolute trash, so I won't dwell on that too much.  It functions, I guess.  You can earn stuff and XP for your regular character in adventure mode, so that's nice I guess.  There are PLENTY of cheaters abound as well (i've had some on my team a few times).  The amount of people playing it isn't that high either.

The weight limit is something that needs to be addressed though and it's terrible.  In all my 100+ hours of playing this game, i've been overweight for probably 60%-70% of it.  I can't tell you the last time i've fast travelled anywhere.  The STASH has a limit to it too so you can't endlessly store your stuff (which sucks and i'm not paying for Fallout 1st for the unlimited scrap box).  Still, that hasn't ruined the game for me and I keep trucking along.  If anything, not being able to fast travel makes me explore a lot more of the map instead of jumping around to the same points all the time.

My BIGGEST issue with FO76 is this...it's one of the jankiest games i've ever played, even for Bethesda standards.  This game feels like it's held together with old duct tape and wads of chewing gum at times, ready to fall apart at a moment's notice.  Sometimes it does and that sucks.  Sometimes it doesn't and you can play for hours with no issues.  Never in my life have I played a jankier game, especially one from a AAA developer / publisher.  I haven't encountered some of the famous Bethesda bugs (falling through the map, etc) but there are PLENTY of bugs and glitches abound.  I could list them all, but then we'd be here all day.

To sum up, if you liked Fallout 4, there is something in FO76 to like.  I would encourage people to try it for themselves, but not for full price.  Wait for it to go on sale and take the plunge.  If you like it, great.  If you don't, that's ok too.",1591128417,1591128417,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,603,26,16533,583,6119,1601323438

As long as you aren't too worried about things being ""canon"" and ""authentic lore"".

liked:

World is huge and well made with a lot of details. Fully exploring it could take hundreds of hours.
Quests are better than most mmos, writing and charcters are standard Beth quality.
Surprisingly low amount of bugs, none of them game breaking so far.
Even more surprising is the low amount of toxic players. Community is mostly nice and helpful.
Fully enjoyable without the monthly subscription, which adds convenience but not pay2win.
Camp building is better than in F04, though not even close to modded F04. 
Mod support, however it's limited to mostly visual and UI mods.
Perks can be swapped at any time. 

disliked:

Limited player interactions, can't even text chat without a mod.
24 players per server makes it somewhat rare to bump into other people..
Not enough quests with NPCs, though Wastelanders patch is taking it in the right direction.
Endgame longevity is achieved by heavy use of RNG, as with most MMOs these days.
No classic dungeons or raids, no challenging endgame group content.
Same old janky engine, graphics and physics feel at least 10 years old.

Likes:
- Large world, detailed and fun to explore
- Some great storyline quests
- Voice acting is good
- Robots and their voice lines are charming
- Progression: leveling your character, unlocking abilities/perk cards, getting better armor and weapons, unlocking plans for customizing your C.A.M.P., and more
- The thrill of fighting the Scorchbeast Queen and watching players come with all their most powerful weapons to help defeat it. 
- Blast zones (the aftermath of players dropping nukes)
- Using awesome weapons
- Suiting up in your power armor

Dislikes:
Boring quests
PVP in adventure mode. 
Inventory management. There is limited stash space and managing your weight becomes a tedious and boring aspect of gameplay, and add on the frustration of finding some awesome weapons or armor that you want to save for later but ultimately give up on due to limited stash space.
Lack of dance emotes unless you subscribe to the Fallout 1st thing.
Bugs/glitches which aren't entirely ruining the game but enough to be annoying.

83,Fallout 76,70053518,english,"My opinion about this game is rather mixed but I still think it's worth it!

I decided to give it a try after the Wastelanders update and Steam release, otherwise I would probably only buy it with a massive discount just to give it a try and on Steam. 

In my opinion the game should have been designed as a singleplayer game with multiplayer capabilities, not the other way around. That was Bethesda's first mistake. They clearly don't know the fallout audience!

That being said, I'm not a big fan of MMOs but it didn't bother me to team up with other players or just to see them passing through. Most are really nice and kind! It kind of makes the world feel more alive!

Short Version: 
Overall I quite liked this game (still the FO game I like the least though) and the West Virginia wasteland eventually started growing on me. But I'm not sure if I could play it again anytime soon unless they come up with a sort of new game+ mode that resets the main quest line while maintaining your level.

Long Version:
I would divide my experience with Fallout 76 in 2 parts. The first I pretty much hated, before I reached level 25-30. The second, after that, I really enjoyed.

So let's focus on the positives first for a change:

+The world is beautifully designed, with clearly distinct areas as opposed to previous fallout games where the worlds are fairly homogeneous.

+ The wastelanders main quest is quite decent. It is clearly rushed at some points, but overall it's pleasant, fun and the new characters are quite interesting. The factions are pretty basic but have decent background stories.

+ The Ally quests are quite long and very engaging.

+ Say what you want about Bethesda, but at least they tried to save this game from mediocrity and in some way they succeeded with Wastelanders.

+ Enemies variety. Monsters for all tastes!


So now the negatives:

- The game is extremely unbalanced and unforgiving for lower levels. I know it's because it's a MMO but ending up being chased around the wasteland by creatures 40-50 levels above me is not my idea of fun or fairness. It gets better as you progress but until you get there it's just frustrating. They could give you some initial advantages to start defining the character you want to build, like on fallout 3 or NV. Here they just dump you into the wasteland with only the clothes you are wearing! No special points or perk for you to allocate! Nothing! Not nice Vault-Tec!

- The ""old"" main quest line is horrible. Boring, not surprising, just basically finding what happened to people long dead through holotapes from point A to B and to A again.... There are some exceptions but overall I don't think I could go through it again. I would probably have hated this game upon release too.

- Crashes, server errors etc. It's infuriating when you are about to complete a quest and the game crashes or the server stops responding. There are not many checkpoints so you basically have to repeat some of the quests all over again, kill the enemies all over again. This would be acceptable if these didn't happen often. But they do. Too often.

-  Pay caps to fast travel. I can understand they are trying to limit fast travels but the prices are too high. At least they could give you more free fast travel points like on Foundation and the Crater.

- That ""final"" quest from the old questline sounds way too confusing when you get to it. It's actually simple just not very well explained in game.

- The vending system is a joke! The game is not very generous in rewarding you caps so how do they expect people to spend caps in player owned vendors. The secret of the game is crafting all you need! But for that...

- Plans, Plans and more plans. Almost every single item you wanna build on your CAMP or craft are only available after finding plans. And there are a lot! Some you can buy from vendors at ridiculously high prices. Others you find  randomly throughout the world. Come on at least give us more starting items to build more advanced camps or group the items into larger groups. I don't wanna pay 1000 caps for a bed plan!

- CAMP system is atrocious. It would  have been better if it was more similar to FO4. My advice keep it simple and small!",1590857894,1590857894,TRUE,1,0,0.523809552,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,58,3,8784,0,8784,1590711555

i have only owned this game 2 maybe 3 days and i hate it more then any other in my collection. 
It legit has the potential to be a great game if they would tone down the pay to win bs. 
game has tons of bugs ...its a bethesda game go figure. XD

Any good i had to say disappeared after an hour of gameplay .
i knew it was going to be bad i just didn't expect it to be this bad , over all it looks like less then fallout 4. The need to eat part destroyed my game play it felt like i was always having to stop in the middle of things to eat and drink felt way too often and slowed down an already boring start to the game . You eat less in green hell then you do in 76 even the forest you eat a ton less then this . the lack of loot was boring all i could find was guns and like 3 rounds for said gun then nothing .....
found a handful of stimpacks but never enough to matter.
caps are limited and hard earned too bad you waste most of them early game on fast travel. 
last quest i did busted my ass for 10 caps 
and forget about rad away lol if you have my luck you will see 2 in 6 hours

6,Fallout 76,69987927,english,"I missed all of the hype about poor gameplay, bugs, and other assorted problems before the Wastelanders release. This FO is not much different (to me) than FO4 except that occasionally the spawns will be immobile and when shot they have no loot. Sometimes they can be totally ignored and they remain statues. I have had about 4-5 random DCs in 200+ hours of play, so take that as you will. It seems like there may be a memory leak somewhere in the game, as maybe 6 times I have noticed my sound abruptly change-my character no longer makes any sound moving and reloading is silent, but gunshots and mobs still make noise. The lack of storage is a bit of a problem for hoarders like me (not like that at all IRL, go figure), but it may not be for others. 
All of that being said, the game is a Bethesda game. It has its quirks, to be sure. But, as a whole I like it. I consider the game bugs as contributors to the difficulty. The sparsity of other players makes sense, but it doesn't feel like a solo game. If you liked FO4, then you probably will like this game too. Too many people spent a great deal of time at Steam release spamming the reviews with nastiness. It colored my thinking until I began to read more reviews and saw that many of the haters just had sore rectums and were venting in reviews.

Stories/Events : 

Went to a Camp to buy from their Vendor. Trap base. Death, junk lost. 
Met my first Mister Two-Shot-Exploding-IDon'tCareIKillYou-Minigun Man. Death, Junk lost. 
 Fashnacht (Horray) Running through Helvetia and some reason I don't know why I fall through the map. (Boo) Death, Junk lost. And to make it better, I crashed and had to restart my PC whilst mid respawn. I miss my Junk

Ideas :
What would be nice would be a perk, or a Legendary Perk (Prefer it to be Legendary Perk) that would decrease thee amount of junk you would drop when you die. Maybe like 25/50/ and 75% intervals for it. Never 100% of course. 

Or maybe when we die we drop a lock box instead. I would of course contain our junk, or with the perk I suggested, some of our junk. It of course would be a Level 3 lock, so then hopefully some people wouldn't be able to take your junk. And then you would hopefully have time to hurry to it and pick up whilst someone is trying to lockpick it.

More Storage would be nice, or even a different bin for Junk. One Junk stash and another stash for everything else. Yes I know, Fallout 1st Scrapbox, but how about a Scrapbox for everyone but this one has a weight limit of maybe like 200. So then 800 for Stash Box, and then 200 for Scrapbox. Scrapbox Lite. 

Or even possible, apply those ""These items weigh less"" perks to Storage so we can put more in

I purchased this game back in early summer of  2019. I put about 10 hours in before I shelved it. It felt like a pointless low-resource, limited-scope, half-baked skeleton of a game. It was bland, repetitive, and didn't seem to have much of a point. To prevent people from rushing through the game they developed some very strong events and questlines...I'm kidding. They nurfed all the weapons, made materials and ammo scarce. And made sure I spent half my time trying to stay fed and hydrated. I couldn't even call it a game, it was more of a chore.

Fast forward about a year...

There's more ammo and resources, and it's now possible to hit something at point blank range on the first shot. Wow, I actually felt like continuing on for a while!

That said for truth in advertising, soon after posting this, I decided to cancel my subscription. See the last paragraph.

As compared to Fallout 4, this is a different game.
* Online only.
* No settlement management, but you get a small camp you can build.
* On public servers, you may not be able to maintain a consistent camp locations due to overlap with other players. This might be mitigated by jumping to another server. 
* Not as immersive as F4.
* Has a griefing system that puts a target on anyone's back who shoots you, as long as you don't return fire, and damage to you is minimal if you don't fight back. Meanwhile they get a bounty on them.
* On the public maps, you are sharing a server with up to 25 people, so it's not going to be the pristine solo world of F4.
* A learning curve to keep yourself fed and hydrated where these elements did not exist in F4.
* All gear deteriorates and must be repaired unlike F4.
* In addition there are multiple levels of gear so you'll see (for example) shotguns with different stats.
* The Perk system is kind of a nightmare until you figure it out, poorly displayed, and unlike F4 where you simply pick a perk, here you assign points to SPECIAL categories and separately assign perk cards. It's confusing at first and I can almost guarantee you'll assign at least one point to the wrong SPECIAL category than you intended. Read up on it first.
* The game can be played for free, but I can almost guarantee that you'll want a subscription to get the portable tent that allows you to scrap,  store gear, and cook on the road, with unlimited scrap storage, and the option to play on your own private server (without admin priviliges). I think if you go cheap, you'll be gnashing your teeth regarding the onerous limited carry capacity your character has, and that you either have to move your camp (for a fee) or return all the way to your camp to dump and store items. And note everytime you move your camp it has to be set up again, all the crops have to be placed again.
* Having friends online is a huge help, there are lots of things you can share when on the same server, very helpful for a low level player. I'm hesitant to subscribe for a year for a $50 savings because frankly, I don't think I'll be playing for a year.
* Daily events are popping regularly.  I call it Developer busy work and it very much reminds me of Red Dead Redemption 2 Online of which  I only lasted for a month. I much prefer a complex quest structure, a compelling main quest line, and settlement management to my busywork routine on Fallout 76. Of note, I give RDR2 solo mode, a thumbs up.

So, so far I've been playing a little less than a month and was still enjoying myself until I hit a wall right after initially posting this review. I just cancelled my Fallout 76 subscription because I’m finding that my routine is too much like work and not enough fun. I can’t even imagine playing this game without a sub.

I captured the racetrack workshop (NW over by the Ferris wheel amusement park) and set up two extractors for the mineral deposits there, that took about an hour and I was happy I had new resources. Then the next day I logged in and it had reverted to un-owned, which is normal, but I’d have to go back and recapture it.

Now, I know at least one player who owns 4 workshops (on his private server) and each day he logs in, he has to recapture all 4 workshops. One of those makes bullets, another makes acid, a vital comoponent. This is besides the 45 minutes I spend per session gathering Blood leaf and soot plants to make Healing Salves, preparing food, sorting, scrapping, and repairing my gear which degrades constantly.

As life-long single play gamer, I was a bit skeptic about the multiplayer aspect of this game.
It turned out not to be too obnoxious, however the massive inconvenience is need of constant and quality internet connection. If your connection is a bit wonky, you won't be able to play - game disconnects (frequently for me).

I like most of the game but I still CAN'T RECOMMEND you to buy.
Started playing when it was free weekend, then bought it. After that publisher committed game update, which causes game crashes constantly (easily five times an hour, then you give up and play something better).

While I don't agree with the early controversy that happened, and the stance that Bethsda took in many cases... I didn't play then and I can't write this specific view from that point of view.

155 hours since the last free weekend, and I am so happy with the time ive put into this game. Is it perfect? Far from it. I run into glitches often with teleporting to bases, glitching through the map, broken weapons, broken quests, really bad long distance rendering in scope view... 

At the same time... in 155 hours I am now level 100, with every main and side quest done outside a few outliers, and I am now working on the more MMO aspects of the game, Dailies and harder challenges, while gear grinding off to the side. I am in no way an expert or a veteran player, but playing this game with friends, meeting a rather friendly community and goofing around with them. Breaking the game with a whole world jumping to one Silo and all use the terminal and break it, to the 'Car Shows' of different Power Suits.

I didn't play on launch at all, so I am reviewing the current game, some time after the Wastelanders DLC.

I played Fallout 76 for the first time when it was free for a weekend. It had a lot of negative reviews, everyone I know said that it's bad, and the entire internet seemed to hate it. I gave it a try because I really like Fallout, and didn't have much to lose. It's important to note that I played with a friend for 90% of the time.

I played three 14 hours sessions in three days. I instantly got hooked. The game is often very glitchy, but if you can see through that, it's really, really enjoyable. I instantly bought it after the free weekend, and after ~100 hours I still feel like there is a huge amount of content that I didn't experience yet. The world is very well built, I am surprised that they got combat working on multiplayer so well, and the variety of enemies and weapons is really good. I also like the perk system a lot. Many will disagree, but I overall enjoyed this game more than most Fallouts, maybe even more than Fallout NV. (NV might still be better in many ways, but experiencing a Fallout world that has been built from ground up to be a multiplayer game is amazing)

I enjoy the freedom that the game gives. There is really no ""meta"", you can play it with almost any character build you want. You can also go to high level areas or events with a low level character, and it really feels like an open world where you don't even need to complete the main quests to have fun. 

I was really surprised by the helpfulness of the people who play this game. The voice chat is nearly impossible to get to work, but people use emotes to interact with each other. High level people help low level people, share supplies, don't usually steal kills and even leave wanted players alone. The community, even if mute, is the friendliest I have seen in a video game.

Obviously, the game is not just 100% good in every way. My review is about what is good in this game, not what is bad about it. You can read any other review for the bad parts (atomic shop, numerous bugs/glitches, fallout 1st, constantly running out of stash space, limited caps on vendors, etc...) The game is a paid game with a freemium feel to it.

39,Fallout 76,69379654,english,"This is one of the worst games I’ve ever played. It is objectively terrible. You can get whatever enjoyment you want out of it, I’m having fun too. But it is an awful, awful game with little to no saving graces. Everything said about the game is true. A crap-ton of bugs that range anywhere from persistently annoying to literally game breaking. At least one gamebreaking bug occurs in every one of my play sessions.

A quest breaks completely and I need to restart it because Bethesda still hasn’t figured out how to properly code AI since Morrowind. I die and the respawn button breaks, preventing me from claiming the rewards of a rare (and expensive to start) event that *I* started for the server. I load into my C.A.M.P. to see *everything* broken and needing to be repaired. My guns stop making sound. My weapons randomly lose durability. My game decides to hard crash, forcing me to open Task Manager and roll the dice as to whether it closes. I consistently drop down to 50-60 frames on an R5 3600/RX 5700XT rig when I should be getting at least double that. The game regularly hitches and stutters in urban areas, much like Fallout 4, the game it copies nearly all of its assets from. Invincible headless enemies that spawn in almost every interior cell. Enemy AI breaking in *every single encounter*. Enemy loot changing in the middle of me looting them. Enemies not dropping loot despite me tagging them. Events not dropping rewards despite completing them. Events breaking because an objective bugs out. Extremely high level enemies spawning in an interior cell when I’m only level 20. And that’s not even touching on the objectively *awfully* designed game mechanics themselves or the serious cheater problem in a battle royale mode that’s been in beta for almost a year with stunningly few changes.

Disturbingly low daily limits on Caps and Legendary Scrip, the latter of which is responsible for filling up the stupidly low Private Stash limit of 800lbs. Idiots try to claim that *you’re* the issue when it comes to that, that *you* should manage your stash better. Most of my stash are legendaries I can’t get rid of because there’s a stupid daily cap on a currency that is only used to roll for a *chance* at a good legendary, of which there are very, very few. Nuke silos are not instanced, meaning any moron can steal nukes from saps who want to finish their main quest. Co-Op in this game is objectively terrible. Sure there are some incentives to play with friends, but then who gets the loot on the shelves, tables, floor, etc.? Am I just supposed to read these massive (some well-written, kudos to some of the writers when they get their leashes taken off) walls of terminal text while my friend just sits there scratching his head waiting for me? Quests taking place in interior cells either must be done solo or done *twice* because it doesn’t progress if it isn’t your instance. The complete lack of endgame? What’s the point of playing after the main quest? There is no end game content. There is no challenging content. Vault Raids were ripped out of the game (and that’s another thing, no explorable vaults in a FALLOUT game. Who the hell saw that and went “Yep! Good Fallout game.”) and literally nothing replaced them. The game, even without the stupidly overpowered legendaries or the rampant duping and cheating, is incredibly easy and mind-numbing. 

Disgusting lack of communication from Bethesda on the state of the game. Most of these bugs have been in the game since BETA. Beyond a corporate “Hey, we’ll get to it :)”, nothing has been done. Wastelanders for some odd reason has restored some good faith for Bethesda, which boggles the mind. The main quest is short and honestly boring, with some well-written characters that are horribly, *horribly* voice-acted. Completing the main quest gets you...another meaningless, long, awful grind for both Raider and Settler reputation to get good gear to use on enemies that would have died nearly as quickly as your overpowered legendary minigun. (This part was subjective in case anyone was rushing to say they loved it.) 

Can’t finish the review without talking about Fallout 1st. The fact that there’s even a few people that defend this incredibly obvious portrayal of almost gluttonous greed is stomach-churning. All Fallout 1st offers are quality-of-life improvements that should have been *baseline*. You get an infinite scrapbox, something that should have been available to everyone. You get a tent you can play anywhere in the world for a free fast travel point, stash, scrapbox, and cooking station. You get a private god-damn server. A PRIVATE SERVER. Something people have been screaming for since BETA. And it gets locked behind a $13 a month subscription service. 

This is what Bethesda is now. There is no counter to this. Fallout 76 is an objectively awful game. If you’re a Fallout fanatic, you might get some enjoyment out of the game like I did. Even then I still wouldn’t recommend it.",1589826825,1590649274,FALSE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,220,23,8171,0,6281,1596476516

When this game first came out it got hit hard  with bad reviews which made me leave the game until it was in a better state. Despite alot of people still complaining about the game I gave it a try on the free weekend and picked it up, I can honestly say i am addicted. Fallout 76 allows you to be whatever character more so than previous games making big guns, energy weapons, melee and so forth extremely enjoyable and a new experience each build. in just over a week i have sunk in 164 hours (only about 20 or so on multiplayer) and I am loving it. The community is extremely friendly, the public events are fun and im not even a quarter the way through the game yet. I can see myself putting an easy 1000h+ into the game. The wastlanders DLC that not long came out has fixed many of the issues people had with the game and on top of that ive had a few minor bugs and the most major bug i have had is two enemies spawn underground stopping me from taking over a place. The building is a million times better than fallout 4, theres more items, the enemies are increased and more fun than previous games, the map is a lot bigger and the game has a very in depth lore (as per usual). My honest thoughts are an easy 9/10 and you shouldnt listen to other peoples opinions and try the game out for yourself.

An additional comment to my review. They planned on releasing an event the community asked for when another event finished.

Obviously it isn't as rich as a single player experience as you would expect from the additional taxation on resources, sharing the world with other players. A less toxic experience due to the removal of text chat and the decided silence of most the players allows you to crack on with whatever you decide to do.

A few odd graphical artifacts, the world is aesthetically pleasing enough for me, I don't run it on Ultra and I don't chase 4K etc, perhaps this would bother other people. some new fauna and flora... Ticks yuck!

Some of the combat experiences are prolonged and cheesing is a very viable tactics (in lieu of abandoning of course) perhaps I have wander in to the wrong area at times, this mostly due to my desire to skip all dialogue.

I would have to agree with the artificial storage limit barrier, surpassable only by a pay wall or constant management, to be detrimental to the overall experience of this game. By level 30 I was throwing away 40 rockets, as there isn't an option to sell them (player shops are disabled at the time of writing this).

You can earn stuff in game to unlock the paid cosmetics as well, I didn't feel this process was too taxing, I probably suffered with a lack of materials to fix things on parity with Fallout 4 so I don't feel sour about having the repair kits as an optional paid item.

The limit on the inventory system has ruined, what would otherwise be a great game and I hope that the return on this decision was worth it.

74,Fallout 76,69881160,english,"So, Fallout 76 huh... This is gonna be a long one...

This review comes from person, who started from Fallout 4. I loved that game. (Almost 1000 hours.) For me, there were minor bugs, but not anything major. It was just what I loved. Then I tried Fallout 3 and Fallout New Vegas. Games that everyone hyped and was like it was second coming of Christ himself. I didn´t like those games. (Fallout 3 20 hours and New Vegas 26 hours.) Gunplay was bad, so I jokingly said that best weapon after apocalypse was baseball bat, because it was the only thing that I can hit with. I played using only that weapon. Characters were ugly as hell and it just wasn't good game. Unlike Fallout 4, which was better in every aspect. Except role-play wise, but there are better games for that, if that is your cup of tea.

Now you know my taste of Fallout series, I start my review.

Fallout 76 was huge dumpster fire when it launched. I thought I'll never play anything like that and Bethesda can go pleasure themselves. But then there was this one weekend when this game was free for couple days and on slight sale. (From 40€ to 30€) I thought that let's take a look, said Tom Nook. And I'll give you a four word summary of this game.

I. 
LOVE. 
THIS. 
GAME.

From gameplay wise, this is like Fallout 4. Kill anything that tries to kill you, loot anything that has even slightest of value, build camp, upgrade weapons, explore the world. Simple, yet so good. Like Tod himself once said ""It just works"". Some people say there are bugs and glitches that ruin the game and whatnot, but on my 76 hours of gameplay (it was intended to be this playtime when I write this review :P), only thing that I found, was one (1) flashing texture, and I blame my potato computer for that one. It can hardly run anything major and I usually crank graphics and textures up, until the game is a slideshow, so I slightly lower those settings. If I try my hardest, I could probably find bugs and glitches about anything, but I'm just casually playing, and not pissing on this game.

From gameplay, only thing that is slightly annoying, is the limited stash size. 800 max and your junk takes up 500-600. Then you walk around over-encumbered trying to find vendor who can buy your extra items and your most common junk. Only if the vendors has enough caps to buy. Vendors restock their items and caps every 20 hours, so there have been times, when I can't sell anything and caps are very hard to come by, so I would not scrap my guns unless they give me some rare junk.
I tried Fallout 1st. It helps on this junk problem, so there's that. 15€/month or 120€/year is way too hefty price. Let's compare it to Nintendo Switch Online, as it's price is about 20€/year. Not good, not good. Bethesda, lower your prices, and I'm sure that more players would buy Fallout 1st memberships.

Multiplayer is interesting. I often forget that I'm in multiplayer server. The only places that you can find players, are vendors or some quest and event points. Other than that, they just disappear on this huge map never to be seen again. And if multiplayer is not to your liking, you can just ignore the other players, like I do. Just don't interact with them. Problem solved. They can't do anything to you, so they're just there. 

So, my thoughts about this game... If you are like me and fancy Fallout 4 more than Fallout 3 or New Vegas, give it a try. 40€ is an OK price, but if you are hesitating, wait it to be on sale. This game has grown from ugly and fat toddler to be a fine young man, that deserves a chance to be taken out to dinner. A brave new world is waiting.

96,Fallout 76,69851605,english,"To be short : After a year and a half, FO76 is still pretty bad.

For the explanations, I'm gonna start with the good stuff first : big new world to explore, with lots of lore stuff like terminals and notes to read, holotapes. You can play with a few buddies (squads of 4), and experience bugs together which is nice. New radio, while recycling lots of Fallout 4 songs, have new good tracks like ""Mr Sandman"". The story isn't bad nor good, it's a subjective point so it really depends on your tastes.

Now on to the issues :

Online-only : permanent latency that affect movement, shooting, and sometimes lagspikes that teleports you.

Combat : slow and not very engaging, because of the latency, but also because the enemies seemed to have lost multiple braincells when being ported from Fallout 4. Also VATS is useless.

Crafting: Weapons and armors break like in New Vegas. Would have been interesting if they wouldn't break that fast, and if combining weapons worked, like in NV. No, you gotta find a proper workbench, and the proper amount of scrap. Or pay for repair kits, your choice.

Loot and scrap : good loot is rare, so you gotta grind for unnecessary stuff. Scrap and meds fills your inventory super quickly, so you gotta empty yourself in your camp that has a limited storage or recycle a lot (at a workbench of course so you gotta find one). If you want better capacity and other cool QoL improvements, Bethesda got Fallout 1st for you. Needless to say that this is stupid.

Perk system: It's a hand of cards now and you gotta change it all the time depending on what you do right now : crafting ? Use crafting cards. Shooting ? Use shooting cards. Healing/eating ? You know the drill. It's annoying. Some people would say you have to make choices to build your character like in New Vegas and specialize, but what are the choices made if you can use all cards at all times, but not at the same time. Also they are mostly useless (weight/hunger/thirst reduction, which are what makes the game grindy of this game).

Actual multiplayer content : I have been playing this past week and beside the starting area I barely met anyone in the game. Most of the people are around events area and even then there is no real multiplayer interest : PvP is non-existant and so is cooperation outside of your friend circle. 

Microtrasanctions : Various cosmetic stuff to buy from the Atom Shop that are super expensive for what they are (and it's the dude that used to buy taunts out of the Mann Co. Store that tells you that). Also a subscription called Fallout 1st to play on private servers+various QoL improvements. Oh and you barely get Atom points to spend.

I haven't played the game prior to the Wastelanders Update, and if people said that it really improved the game, welp then it must have been catastrophic because right now I still wouldn't call that game ""decent"" in its current state. It would have been 100 times better if it could be played offline or in a free private game hosted by the player. Because clearly it was specifically built to push players into getting their unnecessary subscription service: they stripped FO4 from its fun and made it tedious for you to pay.

I most definitely do not recommend this game if you're going to play alone, even if like me you really love Fallout 4. You're better off on a modded version of the latter.

1,Fallout 76,69846263,english,"When I tried 76 during the free weekend, I thought it was actually a lot of fun. And it was; for a good chunk of playtime, certainly more than a lot of games, it's a solid multiplayer fallout experience.

But once you've played for a while, you run into outrageously hostile design. As of right now, Fallout 76 is a glorified mobile game. The devs have absolutely no respect for their players or their time. There are limits on EVERY FEATURE -- arbitrary inventory limits and daily caps on loot and money make it so you just straight up cannot play the game. The loop becomes log on -> sell a tiny bit of loot -> hit the daily limits -> log off. It's ridiculous. It's as user-unfriendly as the most egregious free-to-play garbage, only sold as a 60$ game. It's full price! The players have already payed for the game, but the devs don't let them play it.

Then there's the gameplay. At first, it's fun. Absolutely. But when you hit the aforementioned caps, it becomes a looter-shooter survival game where you CAN'T LOOT ANYTHING. It just becomes pointless to keep playing. And, unlike other fallout games that let you use whatever weapons you want, the game balance combined with the new perk system means you have to completely specialise into a weapon type to actually keep up with optimised players. Gone are the days where you carry a pistol, shotgun, rifle, and gatling laser for emergencies -- no, now you've got 4 different types of bolt-action rifle because those are what you built for.

Honestly, you'd probably have some fun with this game if you bought it. I'd probably even recommend it if it's on sale. The bones are strong. But the design decisions are just so, SO player hostile that I have to write a bad review. Don't buy it.

2,Fallout 76,69839469,english,"Wife and I decided to buy this on sale after the free weekend recently. We enjoyed it a lot more than we expected and wanted to keep playing after the free weekend expired. I don't think either of us expected that given the history of the game and our lack of interest until now. I guess we should be grateful we didn't try the game until this late after launch.

Dunno about 16x the detail, but the graphics are definitely improved over Fallout 4. It's clearly still Fallout 4 engine and assets, which isn't so bad because I really loved Fallout 4 (with mods). The draw distance, textures, and lighting are improved. Not perfect, but they are better. I actually really love the UI with the exception of the local map (like when you're inside buildings or caves) not being present in this game. It's got that classic vault boy charm most fans of the series love.

I think anyone who has played Oblivion/Skyrim/Fallout has wondered what it could be like playing co-op with a friend. To explore the Bethesda open worlds together, show off your loot to one another, visit each others camps and work together to get through the story. It's something I've definitely wanted to experience for many years and I feel like I'm getting that experience here. I really enjoy it.

There are a couple of annoying bugs I've encountered, but nothing game breaking yet. I'm still pretty new so we'll see. I know it's terrible to view Bethesda bugs as charming but you have to admit sometimes that shit is just too funny. In one case when we were both level 15, we came across an area with 3 or 4 level 62 Scorched. They killed us initially, but when we went back to that area the game was glitched and they were standing there with their heads cut off, so we managed to finish our quest with little to no hassle. It was an ""Ohhhh Bethesda"" moment but we chuckled.

""I will leave the morality out of the talk...""

The point of my approach is to get you to think how Bethesda and other Publishers and/or Developers think about us. I have played all the Fallouts and was finally tricked into 76 by Wastelanders. I think this is the first game ever where I actively regret everything about it. I am willing to engage ""tricks"" if I can find and justify the value. I play with a group of wonderful people, mostly lvl 200 - 600, most of whom seem to dislike the game but can't stop playing it. Over the weeks I've been playing I've been listening to these other players closely and thinking about the psychology.  

I urge you to read books like the one Torulf references ""Hooked - Nir Eyal, 2014"". I urge you to read books like ""Battle for the Mind - William Sargant, 1957"".

[B]Review:[/b]

[h1]Let's Go Whaling!!![/h1]

You think you're playing Fallout 76. The twist is Bethesda is playing a game designed by Torulf Jernstrom named ""Let's Go Whaling - Tricks for Monetizing Players"".

Mind the quotes - That's Torulf speaking. 

[b]1.) The spend comes from the whales[/b] - you get more if you pay extra - Small, Very Dedicated Player Base

[b]2.) Make sure there's MORE to spend on[/b] over and above the initial purchase price - Atom Shop after you pay for Fallout 76 and maybe Fallout 1st.

[b]3.) Sell:[/b]
 - Convenience to those who want to progress
 - Customization to the social people
 - I don't know about competitive advantage - When I tried the PVP I immediately found hackers so... you don't give money to Bethesda for that...
 - Content to Explorers

[b]4.) Monetization by Stage[/b]
Hook - There's a ""story"" and an Overseer who says ""The best and the brightest."" so many times it annoyed the poop out of me.

SHE'S TALKING ABOUT YOU!!! YOU'RE THE BEST! YOU'RE THE BRIGHTEST! YOU!!! YOU ARE THE BEST!!! WOOOOO YOU!!!

Habit - Kill -> Loot -> Craft ->Kill -> Loot -> Craft ->Kill -> Loot -> Craft ->Kill -> Loot -> Craft ->Kill -> Loot -> Craft 

Hobby - Congratulations! You found other crackheads... I mean you made some online friends with which to enjoy the immersive and bugged as f*** Fallout 76 experience.

[b]5.) Gacha! aka Gotcha! aka Sucker![/b]
No matter how much you spend there are some things you cannot get.
Yeah, constant special events - random drops. ""These are great for monetization and retention because people like the uhh, uhh, the lottery part of it. It's exciting and stretches content because people cannot immediately get what they want.""

Everything else is a massive grind.

On day two I met a level 700 player who was DEEPLY upset because I had some stupid mask that he had no way to get. Apparently I bought at ""the right time"". I was initially baffled by his reaction. Dude, it looks almost exactly like that other mask I picked up from level 1 enemies.

[b]6.) Do you want a big player base or a small player base?[/b]
Bethesda seems to have opted for a relatively small player base aka whales.

[b]7.) People are loss averse.[/b]
- They have more pride in things they think are scarce. And want more scarce things. That lvl 700 guy really wanted my stupid little cosmetic mask.
- Timed or seasonal events. Oh look, Bethesda just announced seasons where you can pay to progress.
-*dangle item in the air*  ""I'll take it away from you. I'll take it away from you. This is a brilliant way to get more from people.""

[b]8.) Subscription[/b] 
- ""If you spend your money then you will only get the benefit if you keep coming back to the game very often.""
- ""This drives monetization and retention. Build stuff that makes people come back to your game a lot.""

[b]9.) IKEA effect[/b]
- ""They sell you cardboard. It's shit. But you place more value in it because you built it yourself. This is from a book called Hooked, how to make products that hook.""
- Do the Gacha randomized rewards. Give people things that they have to build themselves because then they ""Do a little bit of work and become emotionally attached to that."" - Oh like that f***'ing backpack that can carry 10 more units of junk if I spend hours doing those arbitrary and ridiculous World Challenges, gotcha... ahh ha ha. Gotcha!
- ""So that's the trigger, then we go round and round, then we have the habit.""

[b]10.) Anchoring - ""Anchoring is fun!""[/b]
- Anchor the value of an item in the player's mind. Stupid little cosmetic mask is worth nothing to me but there's someone who thinks it's worth very much... like a level 700 guy in Fallout 76.
- Or that trick where Bethesda introduced items to the Atomic Shop with price tags that read 75% Off. Hmm. Hmm.... Hmmmmmmmmmmmmm... Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm...
- ""Just because I wrote down a high number on a paper will anchor my thinking on what goes next.""
- ""Suggest an in-app-purchase for 50 Euros. Of course they say no. I come back a few sessions later and suggest they buy it for 15. They think 'That's good value.' because my anchor was at 50.""

[b]11.) Social Proof[/b] 
- ""Make spending socially acceptable."" 
- ""Never tell players that the majority in your game never spend money.""
- Reward spending - Show off your Fallout 1st icons, armors and camp shizz.

[b]12.) Core Loop Through Store[/b]
- Always remind players of things in the store 
- Build your camp, always see what you don't ""own"" yet.

[b]13.) Spend[/b] 
- ""Because Reasons"" - He seriously just says this. It's on his PPT with a monocled, top-hat wearing, twirly moustache guy holding champagne.

[b]14.) Games Of Progression[/b]
- Ways to Progress: Skill, Luck, Grind, Pay

- ""Make sure that your games aren't too skill based. I made this mistake myself. Too skill based games, you don't get people to pay you because there's no reason to.""
 
Bethesda really nailed this one. There's nothing in Fallout 76 that is a challenge. Nothing. Everything is easy. Everything is very easy. If I die, it's because laggy, jittery servers that refuse to let me switch weapons in the middle of a scorchbeast queen fight. But you probably won't die unless you do something really dumb because... it's too easy. Bethesda went for LUCK and GRIND. The ""You're so S.P.E.C.I.A.L"" quests get you hooked, then the end game is grind. The end is grind. It is grind. Grind everyday. Every day.

- ""Make sure that players understand that Grind and Pay are options.""

Grind Atoms, unless you pay ofc. Grind scrip, daily cap. Grind bullion, daily cap. Grind rarer junk. Grind components.

WHALES!!!

15,Fallout 76,68107464,english,"Wastelanders makes Fallout 76 an overall enjoyable game.  That's saying a lot considering where the game started.  Even so, it is still buggy as hell.  Bethesda has had a long time to work out so many obvious bugs.  I often wonder how much money they saved by hiring blind QA staff.  With Bethesda's history of poor QA in all of it's games, this is becoming somewhat of a meme.  Find an obvious bug that happens all the time and has been going on for years?  It's just there because Bethesda is too cheap to hire anyone to notice or fix it.

Edit: Here are my updated views after playing for a month: Bethesda recently released patch 19, which fixed a few bugs.  It seems as if the bugs they fixed were ones which made certain items usable at the endgame.  I'm glad they fixed some bugs, but try fixing the actual bugs and not just ones that accidently solve balance issues.  In a nutshell, Bethesda fixed stuff that worked, ignored what was broken, and the balance of the game only got worse.  Thanks for that.

At the end of my month of Fallout 1st, I have chosen not to renew the subscription.  Unlike many others, I find it to be worth the price due to the private servers.  If someone is being a pain in a public server, you can simply hop onto a private server and even invite your friends.  You can grind all you want there and return to public whenever you like.  This fixes a truckload of issues that other games struggle with.  I cancelled my subscription because there are so many limits on my daily playtime.  Within an hour of loading in, I can quite casually be maxed out on caps, scrip, gold bullion, reputation, and most importantly: stash space.  This makes it not only impractical, but very difficult to play any further for the day.  I will consider returning to the game and resubscribing when Bethesda stops putting soft limits on my daily playtime.  I don't expect that to happen, so I don't expect to play the game much if at all going forward.",1587978004,1590471331,FALSE,5,1,0.52887553,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,173,14,27955,0,8121,1600673343

It is still a decent buy for the time you can invest. Just get the standard/sale.

PvP and PvE hinder another. This should have been a free for all world or a story experience. Neither done right. As a MMO, it is actually weaker too. Perk card system is pretty weak, from just annoying to swap from combat, farming, crafting cards and not letting you do much to build how you want. The vast majority of cards will be for ONE specific style of play: Shotgun, Rifles, auto-rifles, pistols, auto-pistols, melee (ETC).

The level system is pretty tiring and outdated for games these days. This game would have been better off with none. It's fine to develop a character, but don't do levels. The most balanced and fair gameplay would let anyone be a threat, just don't take on the guy in full power armor wielding a plasma gatling with a pipe pistol in leather.

There is too much food, water, drugs, ammo, available to players. 

The best things about this game is the exploration. Coop is good, but not when there are Holotapes to listen for 2-5mins (not that i like them at all) and NPC's.


They can add all the additional content they want, but it will only be adding layers. Makes me want to go back to Fallout 4 and avoid pesky latency delays and high level players being a pain. I do look forward to TES6 and Fallout 5 allowing coop, i hope.


They even capped the stash at weight limit (instead of ... 999 or something?), to a frustrating level. You go from inventory management to stash management. Oh, but if you pay a monthly subscription for ""Fallout 1st"" then you got unlimited space.",1590464282,1590470202,TRUE,1,0,0.505700648,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,296,23,11176,168,8241,1601884423
18,Fallout 76,69810409,english,"At the time of posting this review, I have 125 hours of gameplay done and all of the main quests finished.  While I am enjoying the game and have enjoyed all of the previous Fallout games, I don't recommend it for anyone but hardcore Fallout fans.  This is why:

The entire game is nothing but a never ending series of fetch quests.  You know, the kind that are annoying as hell in every roleplaying and MMO game ever.  In fact, the ENTIRE GAME is a fetch quest.  Worse still, you can be in the middle of one of the chains of a quest, log off, only to discover the quest didnt save because you didnt complete the ENTIRE chain of it, which can be dozens of ""go get me this"" and ""thanks, but now I need that"" followed by ""one more thing..."".

The entire process of these fetch quests is all encompassed in a never ending grind to collect literally trash and bits and pieces of stuff to make...well....more trash.  The crafting system while decent is also linked to a never ending grind to find plans to make more crap.  A subscription to Fallout 1st is not required, but if you do not want a majority of your game play to be designated towards inventory management, it is highly recommended to subscribe to Fallout 1st.

The game is LOADED with bugs.  I have had several quests be completely dropped and need to be restarted due to crashing to desktop.  There has been two duplicating exploits resulting in the shutdown of vendors, which players rely on to sell all the crap they gathered.  Bethesda either has no way to place hotfixes to rapidly patch bugs, or they only have one programmer fixing them because they take WEEKS to fix things that should be core elements of the game.  Announcements of upcoming improvements are always proceeded with another one saying there was a bug and the improvements will be released at a later date.

Base building has it's challenges, but overall is well done and is very similar to Fallout 4.  A lot of the game revolves around finding plans, and plans for your base are no exception.

I'm a huge fan of Fallout series, so when F76 landed on Steam with a discount, I decided to give F76 a shot, but I did not have high expectations. 

First off, I agree with most negative reviews here (those containing constructive criticism). The game is buggy and has some technical issues, the game world is pretty empty (there are only a few NPCs located mostly by the main hubs), traveling from one edge of the map to another to finish a quest can be frustrating, the monthly subscription is a spoof and the most important - it's not the real Fallout game everyone was waiting for. There can be a lot more complaints about the game and I can agree with them and I easily understand people who didn't like F76 at all.

The positive review of F76 results from the fact that I managed to ignore most of the mentioned flaws without any effort. First of all, I was surprised by the number of quests I got after the first hour of gameplay. I was thrown into a server with some low-level players like me so I met others quite often. Fighting alongside other wastelander is quite a refreshing and pleasant experience. It got me a feeling quite the opposite of emptiness - even though I rarely found any human NPC in the game world, I had a feeling that I play in a living world, not very populated, but living. There is also a decent event system so it's pretty easy to meet up with other players on the server. The base building is pretty demanding but very enjoyable at the same time. The number of materials is very scarce comparing to Fallout 4, which encourages long expeditions (or teleporting to known locations - whatever you like). Some call it grinding, I call it a crafting game. 

This review got pretty long so I will just sum up my impressions after 46h of gameplay. I got totally immersed in F76 even though it can't be called a proper RPG (or even Action RPG) game. I just feel like playing a good semi-casual survival, crafting, open-world MMOG with Fallout layout. I haven't got bored yet as there are a lot of activities to take - you can choose from really a lot of quests (including daily), you can join events with other players, you can do challenges (which are often rewarded with Atoms used to buy items in the cash shop), you can improve your camp, craft or just scavenge. I believe there is also some PVP activity like claiming workshops but I haven't tried it yet.

My only worry right now is that there may be very low end-game content if new quests/events/challenges are not added regularly.

Solid gameplay with a decent perk system and as of now the micro-transactions aren't terrible. 
The story is grim to say the least with better voice acting than most other bethesda games mainly seen in the audio logs. This quality of voice acting hasn't yet been seen in Fallout games other than professional mods for New Vegas.

The raiders questline has some real charm and the foundation questline has some interesting characters further into it with the military personnel. The random events that pop up are nice but it would be good to see many more added. Most of the new lore added is solid especially with the cryptids and the Enclave. There are fun gameplay mechanics such as mutations and nuking a zone. 

The bad.
well the graphics aren't great to look at and the frames are equally unimpressive. To even achieve decent frames you need to go into your game settings through your documents folder to change the lod on the grass among other things because they don't know how to give the player options in the graphics menus as that relied on console commands in previous titles. The game really doesn't like alt-tabing and will crash or change resolution because of this and will require game restart to fix. So meh graphics, meh optimization and not the best options to improve either although you can make it look better with nvidia overlay. Respec-ing characters is a slog as you can only move 1 of your special points per level up after level 50 so if you dont have a certain build in mind early on and plan well you will be stuck doing damage control for a while. This isn't explained well enough and it makes it hard on new players. There isn't a ton to do currently after you complete the main story line as you can't replay certain missions and the daily quests are kinda boring, the raids weren't great and they were removed but like why... they should have been fixed not removed. There is one less thing for end game now. 
The unforgivable that needs to be addressed. 
This all ties into the subscription service fallout 1st. Bethesda knows that diehard fans will buy into fallout first, as it is almost required to fully enjoy the game. But at end game it becomes even worse. You might wonder how this becomes apparent. The daily caps on what you can do arise. You can only get 1400 caps a day from vendors. your first 20-30 levels you may not even reach this but at end game you do so incredibly fast. This means you have to sign on every day and artifically increases the amount of days one would play which draws out the months one can play and the months of fallout first they buy. The junk stash which is unlimited storage for junk is absolutely needed to enjoy the game as i find myself reaching the 800 lb limit easy on the regular storage without any junk. There are more limits than this like the legendary script limits to 150 a day, that is only 1.5 3 star legendary items a day in script and i find myself hoarding legendary weapons to scrap into script and log on daily not to play every day but akin to redeeming rewards like on a mobile game. This game isnt a good game to hop on for the weekend it is a daily grind for 1-3 hours a day depending on what you have saved up as the caps and scrip and bullion limits are daily instead of weekly. 

The things that need to be fixed for me to recommend this game
Turn daily limits of script and bullion into weekly limits
increase daily cap and weekly limits of bullion and script by a factor of at least 3
add end game raid content
make the scrap-box accessible without fallout 1st
change respec to be more readily accessible to allow for experimenting and having fun you know like a game
fix the resolution glitch 
fix the ability for people to play through a storyline together not just tagging along


I honestly have enjoyed myself so far in this game, but I can see it just as a growing source of frustration with its daily limits reminding me of mobile games. Why does the game i enjoy not want me to play it longer WHYYYYYY!!!? well to artificially increase daily player count to show to investors, i know why, that doesn't mean i like it.


Edit: After the mole miner event which spawns brand new legendary enemies none of which are max level makes it so no one can get end game gear from them
The Faschnat day parade event is also broken now even becoming delayed due to a bug that had been reported for weeks before the event was scheduled to take place.

Ok look, I am not going to claim this game is the best game ever, but as it stands right now, this is the most fun I have ever had with an online survival game. I am pretty positive people are way too harsh with this game simply because of the Bethesda name behind it.  I mean I have played Conan Exiles, and that game has TERRIBLE game breaking bugs, and lag issues which makes it unplayable online, but you do not see the same hate you see when people talk of FO76 which in my opinion is light years ahead.

I do not like the online shop but to be honest, not only you can pretty much earn (slowly) any of the special visual skins available in there, but they are not needed at all for this game enjoyment since all you can buy, you need to be able to craft the base item in game anyways by first finding its recipie (so there is no pay to win).

You will find me at the front of the train when it comes to bashing Bethesda's art in games, I hated Skyrim looks when it came out, and always felt all of their game looked outdated on release, however the art in FO76 is the best you will find in a Bethesda game.

A lot of the half-baked features of Fallout 4 now make sense IN Fallout 76. 

• World & Characters: 4/5
A bit empty, a bit uninspired here and there, but it does feel like Fallout.
There are the sweet little details here and there which make the series what it is.

• Story & Quests: 2/5
Even though the characters are fine and the writing os okay, the quests as gameplay are dull, repetitive, mostly overpainted fetch/kill quests which may have been scripted and tested better.
No choice presented, except for the first quest which had to look ""sexy"", I guess. Just go here, then here, then at these 5 places.

• Gameplay: 5/5
Nice solid combat system and fresh and flexible leveling system. I love it.
The hoarding issues of Fallout 4 have been fixed, more or less, and the game is what you might expect from an open world adventure. The multiplayer aspect doesn't work very well with the quest system, but... One doesn't play Fallout for the multiplayer.

42,Fallout 76,69792485,english,"So to be quite real this review will have the context that I had just came into this game with the bare minimum expectations from the metaphorical nuke of Fo76 on YouTube shortly after the Wastelanders update, I have no prior experience in prior updates.

This game has some tedious grinds that I do have a bit of respect, you can't just unlock everything within a few weeks of playing to my knowledge without possibly try-harding and looking up tutorials to complete certain events and missions in a quick glitchy fashion. It's got quite a bit of RNG chance to which legendary effects drop on legendary items which can be a bit of a hell to get lucky with, but it gives quite a bit variety in the way you can play the game. Overall I have to say I myself and the few friends I convinced to buy the game enjoy the gameplay mechanics of this as it's done in a way that lets you experience the game in many playstyles.

Lets discuss the Fallout First subscription of $12.99 USD a month in my native currency. I cannot lie, to have a comfortable time playing the game, this is necessary. I do not personally enjoy the fact that a pay-wall exists to have a more comfortable time playing the game and the game doesn't give you quite enough space for your scrap without it. I found myself bottle-necking in storage around level 40 (Max level benefits stop at 50) which should be towards the late game experience. At this time I was struggling to continue to craft simple things such as bullets and always spent the game struggling just to have enough ammo to survive while prioritizing resources needed for base construction (ie. Steel, Concrete, ect.) which were quite pricey if you tinkered around with the map-placed workshops to farm too. I don't need to go to deep into depth with this as YouTube videos cover it pretty well, but my justification for purchasing it is if you play this game, expect to need it. As a live-action service RPG (kinda mmo but not really since world instances is low-player count) it does have a bit of a purpose. It isn't exactly popular to charge a monthly subscription, but many games in this live-action service mmo rpg genre do of some sort tend to have something like this. WoW for example if I'm correct you could buy Battle for Azeroth for $50.00 USD and realize you don't even get a one week trial for the game only to have to purchase the subscription. EvE online there is a monetized subscription model itself in the game to help profits. I don't agree with the tactic but I do not think they wrote the play-book for this and shouldn't be punished as harsh as they are for it.",1590429044,1590429044,TRUE,1,0,0.503178298,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,365,3,27327,2788,6581,1601618634
43,Fallout 76,69775862,english,"Hi, 160 lvl here. Would recommend if you are a hardcore Fallout 4 fan, for everyone else - skip it.

[h1] Pros: [/h1]
1. Graphics 
	Game still amazes me with some good scenery even after 200+ hours. Using in-game camera can make any photo you take a loading screen.
2. Exploring 
	It's fun to clear a new POI, there is a lot stuff to explore, hidden secrets, holotapes with history and stuff. Entertain you alot.
3. Community 
	Most friendly community i encountered.

[h1]Cons:[/h1]
1. Bugs
	This game is nothing more than a bunch of bugs shipped as a game. Rubber banding HP, immortal enemies, bugged quests, NPC muting mid dialogue, VATS 95% missing 3-5 times in a row, vault only respawn after death, inability to initiate fast travel. The list goes on. 
	Worst part is that Bugthesda does nothing to repair any gameplay-critical bug (some aforementioned bugs where from the game release 1,5 years ago), unless the bug can be used by players for some juicy benefits (duping, grind made easier, etc.) then it will be hotfixed in a couple of days.

2. UX
	This is one of the worst UX i saw in-game. 
	Lots of button pressing makes sense for a consoles, pressing 4 separate keys to repair a weapon on workbench on PC does not. 
	To go to main menu is: ESC, Z. To repair a weapon: SPACE, choose weapon, T, R, SPACE. 
	Want to know which armor pieces are 3 star? Well you have to scroll one by one, because item naming generates names too long to see stars at the end of name.
	Want to check what modifiers you have on this legendary from inventory? You have to press X or i will show you only the first modifier.

3. Information level 
	Both in-game infos and changelogs are terrible.
	LOTS of bad changes (like 3 star legendary enemies now have 33% chance to drop a 3 star item instead of 100%) were made into the game without mentioning them in a changelog, when community manager was asked ""why it is so?"" the answer was ""Sorry, we forgot"". 
	Lots of in-game stuff have insufficient detail level. For example barrel mod description ""Improved recoil, hip-fire accuracy"" actually grants ""5% action point cost reduction 1.5% transition to sighted time reduction"". To understand what mod actually does, [b] players had to datamine info from the game files [/b], thats just ridiculous.

4. Time gating mechanics
	Game have really bad time gating mechanics if you wish to learn all plans or get some powerful item. For example, curriencies: Gold bullion, scrips and caps.
	First one can be acquired from certificates 200 per day + buying with caps 300 a week resulting in 1700 bullion per week if you are an active player. How much bullion you need to buy armor? Secret service (without underamor, mods and helmet (this one is purely cosmetic)) Chest 1250, each arm and leg 750, so it will take 2,5 week to get parts only.
	Scrips can be acquired by trading in legendaries, you can get up to 150 scrips a day. This limit is really easy to achieve with 3 3-star and 2 2-star weapons. Any other legendaries you encountered you have to store in chest making it full in a couple of good hunts. How much scrips do you need for stuff? 3 star weapon is 100 scrips, 3 star armor - 60. And you have to buy a ton of them to get something useful because of RNG. Why can't they make a system similiar to blood shards from Diablo 3 is above my understanding.
	Caps limit a day is 1200, you hit it in first 5 minutes of the game. After that you have to drop all your precious loot, because it weights too much.
	Reputation is literally torture to grind, there is only 4 daily quests that gives rep, making it a boring chore on a second day. Time needed to get to max rank? Alot. Using a bug, one can get a rep reward by talking to NPC without finishing quest. Only by talking with NPC it takes more than an hour to get to max rep from 0.

5. Priorities and Quality of Life changes
	If you have an optimised build, you will have to constantly swap perk cards for lockpickng, hacking, repairing weapons and armor (those 2 separate perks) and crafting. It gets frustrating really fast. Bugthesda pointed perk loadouts feature (why not calling them decks?!) will solve this, but it will only be done at the end of this year. Yet, there is a fan made mod and it was first uploaded at december, 2018. Whats in a new updates then? Atom shop items and seasons no one asked for.
	Wanna play in party? To get XP or loot you have to hit a target. Another player is too strong and one shots everything? Well, too bad, can't help it.
	Doing daily where you have to take a photo of a NPC leader? Lets make it a loading screen! You dont want it? Well, you have to delete it manually every time you are doing daily. Dont want to do daily then? Shame, it's 1 of 4 daily that grants rep.

6. Failed game concept
	The game can be described as survival game and loot shooter, yet it is neither of those things.
	It's too easy to survive (food and drinks are no problem after exiting the vault, character doesn't need to sleep, there are more antirads in-game then radroaches) and it's too hard to loot (too restricting weight limit and scrips\money caps).
	As a bonus, we have a Nuclear Winter mode (pesky battle royal) where sitting in bushes for 15 minutes will grant you 700 XP, and killing an enemy will give only 20 XP. Making it the game for campers and cheaters.

News for 19 UPDATE:

	This update came with 2 events: mole treasure hunters and fastnacht.
	First one is pure grind killing 20-30 lvl legendary mobs for their lunch boxes (which is not good for high lvl players - they wont get any good max lvl legendary). According to devs lunch boxes should drop plans (crocodile backpack, some new costumes, etc) and stuff. Dataminers said that dropchances for new plans are actually 2%, ouch. Overall its not bad for low lvl players.
	Fastntacht, on the other hand, started 20 mins ago and doesnt work properly at all. To run the event you need critters intestines, but critters respawns were broken long time ago.

Pros:
+Well done cooperative and pvp multiplayer
+Perk system is in depth and a lot of fun to customize
+Quests are generally unique and have interesting storylines
+Weapon variety is great
+Enemy variety is very good
+Using the right build you can become very powerful without being capped like other mmos
+Graphics are good (mostly)
+Soundtrack is good and atmospheric
+Player speech options are funny and choice is big in this entry, possible more so than fallout 4.
+Adresses many of the issues with fallout 4 that required mods and makes them key features
+Well balanced when fighting players in most cases
+C.A.M.P building is a ton of fun
+Very expansive and detailed map with secrets around every corner

Cons:
-Encountered lighting errors and hard PC crashes that required cutting power
-FPS is locked to 48fps by default. Lookup fps fix to re-enable unlocked fps. Easy fix, but should definitely not be turned on by default.
-Cap economy is harder than previous entries.  Definitely invest in hard bargain and charisma. Also consider a purified water farm, and the economy will become easier for you.
-Nuclear winter battle royale doesnt fit inside this type of a game.
-Endgame will likely be heavily RNG based, but up to that point progression is a result of player choice.
-Massive FPS stuttering and poor optimiztion in the mire and other exterior instances on even high powered hardware.
-Limited cap trading per day limits your earning potential.
-Many of the items are copy-pasted from fallout 4. Not as exciting for people who played fallout 4, but still great for new players.

You basically get dropped into an open world with little to no guidance, faulty mechanics and a hard to understand level system.

70,Fallout 76,69414727,english,"If you have played a Fallout game before, then you will probably like this one too with a few exceptions/caveats.

The Good Reasons to Play this Game:

1) If you like the Fallout series of games, you will probably like this one too.

2) The Wastelander Story missions are pretty good, and I think have made up for what people were complaining about when Fallout 76 was first released. It wasn't a story based RPG, but now it is, more or less. The story missions are fun!

3) They didn't make this a pay-to-win type of online game, and while there are various exploits and hacks that Bethesda has not patched, the game doesn't require you to keep spending money to have a good time. This is a great thing.

4) There is a lot of humor written into the dialogue of the characters in this game. For example the scrapbot robot that is at your camp keeps making these hilarious statements that cracks me up every time. Kudos to the writers of these characters.

5) This game seems to have a good road map going forward. I really am looking forward to the future story based missions with Brotherhood of Steel and other factions. So long term this game should keep getting better.

The detractors of Fallout 76:

1) This is an online RPG game, which in my opinion makes it worse than the previous Fallout games because you now have to deal with server problems, lag, being kicked from the server, and PVP hackers who like to harass you by going into God mode and attacking you. The plus side of being able to play along with ""friends"" doesn't make up for all its downsides. 

3) If you have played Fallout before then you are very familiar with various bugs/game instabilities and crashes that tend to happen with Bethesda games. This one is no different. However if you are not used to this kind of experience, you may end up chucking your PC out the window due to frustration from playing this game.

4) Did I mention lag and server issues? Yeah this is a big problem and never was a problem before with previous Fallout games. Personally I wish they would just scrap the whole online component and make it a regular single player game like all the previous ones. It would solve a lot of headaches like server problems, lag and hackers.

5) Graphically speaking this game looks like it was made back in 2010. It looks 10 years old. 

6) The AI of the enemy NPCs is ridiculously bad, and the enemies either stand there and let you kill them or at higher levels become these damage sponges where you have to dump 200+ bullets into one to drop it. Yet it doesn't move smartly. I wish they have spent more time making the enemy AI stronger and not relying so much on just ramping up damage absorption at the higher levels. In the real world 1-2 well placed shots will kill pretty much anything with the right firearm and rounds. Dumping 200+ rounds into something to drop it is pretty silly.

7) The game engine is outdated. You have tons of loading screens to deal with every time you change location or enter a building. Most modern game engines now don't require loading screens. (For example The Witcher 3 and Assassins Creed Odyssey). The AI is bad and the collision detection system is bad. Also the bullet trajectory and aiming system is bad. Even the VATS system sucks in this game. It was MUCH BETTER in Fallout 4. In Fallout 4 you used VATS for entertainment purposes where you could watch a slow motion, third-person view of you taking a shot and killing an enemy, usuially with a spectacular ending. In this game VATS is needed because the regular ballistics system sucks, you don't have those cool slow motion animations and you don't get those satisfactory kill scene animations at the end. Thumbs down for the VATS system in this game. 

8) The Grind to become allied with a faction is really slow and boring after the main story ends. I am not sure I will continue playing just to grind for a month so I can get a gauss shotgun. Thumbs down for the grind. What they should do is either make it easier to gain faction credit by offering more missions a day and vary them. Having 3 total faction missions sucks, and the random encounter missions are totally pointless because the amount of credit you get for taking part in them is so small it becomes not worth the effort.",1589886303,1590360894,TRUE,4,0,0.515770078,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,94,7,32404,0,10377,1594737022

It's clear that this is not a Fallout game that fans expected and wanted. With how badly received the game was at launch, it's only reasonable if people would rather stay away from this game. But hear me out. I never played the vanilla game, but it seems that the game is finally shaping up nicely with the Wastelander update. After numerous patches and content addition, the game receives a well-received overall review scores on Steam at the moment.

One thing that people need to understand is that Fallout 76 is basically an open world survival crafting game first and foremost painted in Fallout coat, and it does a great job at it. In fact, I think it's probably the best and most polished game compared to hundreds of other games in the same genre out there. The production value is not even comparable, from visuals, voice acting, quests, combat encounters, loots, and crafting, everything are above the competitors. 

The quests are your regular Fallout 4 fare with main, side, and miscellaneous quests. There are choices in the main quests, but I don't expect anything too deep in the RPG mechanics, especially since the SPECIAL works entirely different in this game. There's one thing that I'd like to point out though, the writing and quest design are definitely better than Fallout 4. Seems like they hired a new writer for this. Lack of voiced protagonist helps too, since there's no limitation to the dialogue choices now.

Anyway, 76 is mostly Fallout 4, but with prettier graphics and online elements in which you can see other players around you. It sounds simple, but the online part is very important to help enhancing the experience in 76. There's no save scumming nor cheating (like with mods), so exploring and finding stuff are meaningful and rewarding. Every single thing you do does matter because it can help to improve your character. In a single player Fallout, character progression doesn't really matter, as your main goal is to beat the game. 

But in a multiplayer environment, there's this urge to get better so that you can show off to people, especially since there are numerous social aspects in the game, from grouping up to trading. Completing events and objective with other players seamlessly is quite a joy too. While there is an in-game cash shop, you can earn the premium currency by simply playing the game. I've earned a few hundreds Atoms from just playing so far, and I can use it to buy anything in the cash shop.

Ultimately, it's really a new kind of Fallout. When you accept the game as it is (it's a spin-off, not a mainline game), you'll understand why there are people who enjoy it. It's also very casual friendly, and it's interesting how the community is shaped in a positive manner.

I bought this game when the Wastelanders patch came out which includes NPC (LOL an online MMORPG without NPC on vanilla Fo76) Anyways I have a good time with the game but damn me to hell I do not get why everything is so limited like a mobile game. 

I think Tencent games funded this project not ZeniMax. The practices in his game is so anti-consumer you might have a better deal with your local drug dealer and still get a better customer service.

First off when I say limited :
- Want to sell loot? You can only earn 1400caps from NPC everytime they reset (20-24hours) and ALL VENDORS SHARE THE MAXIMUM CAP
- 800lbs limit on your stash, want unlimited stash for your junk? Buy fallout 1st a subscription model which cost about $180 AUD a year ( I can buy 5 triple A title games) The reason they said they can't give us unlimited stash is because ''PERFORMANCE ISSUES'' and then they pullout the subscription model of Fallout 1st and you get an unlimited stash if you pay.
- They kept all this limited earning per day such as gold bullion (end game currency) so you have to grind for like a year I think to get everything unlocked and you can only earn a certain amount per day too

Things That Annoy :
- out of date inventory management user interface
- limited stash, limited caps per day, limited gold bullion earning
- cleared the place? someone else just fast travelled to your zone, monsters respawns. the level scaling of monsters turns them into a bullet sponge or one punch man if a higher level player than you fast travels near you.
- many things can still be improve and they keep focusing on monetising the sh*t out of the game, look at the new roadmap with their new ''battlepass'' like system (yes you can earn it for free, but there will be pay to advance sort of like Dota2 battlepass)
- there is so much bugs they have to disable alot of function in the game week after week even if they fix it (e.g duping with player shop and display cabinets)
- although with the new Wastelanders update adding NPC to the game, you still feel the vanilla part of the game which includes alot of Terminal/Notes reading. If I want to read, I'll read a book.

Thoughts :
- I'm done with Bethesda, I really tried to support them with this latest game despite the controversy when it came out. They just kept throwing ways to monetise the game while alot of issues are not fix yet. At this rate I have more respect for the guys behind No Man's Sky as although they messed up really big time, they are a small team and they put more effort in fixing the game than trying to find new ways to monetise players. I would not recommend this game unless you are desperate for something to play during Covid.

I also hope reviews aren't limited (like everything in this game but we'll get to it later.) [/h1]

[b] First of all, im doing this review because i need to explain why i spent so many hours in this game in so little time.
This game had a terrible start and went on steam with the Wastelander update.
 [/b]

- When starting the game you'll be emerged by the apocalyptic ambient, the musics are nice and enjoyable, battle music are just like skyrim, you love them they cool.
The first problem that went into my mind was the keys, i don't understand why [u] ""tab"" [/u] do [u] EVERYTHING [/u], light from pip-boy, cancel, back, inventory. Why the grenade/bash is the same key aswell, [u] just let me choose [/u], what's the problem with that? 
Beside that, you'll learn to play along with them [spoiler] (even if you keep pressing ""esc"" and open the map when all you wanted is to leave the inventory while getting attacked *wink wink*) [/spoiler]

-While leveling and placing your points, you'll learn that this game is a grind game,so it's [u] pointless [/u] to upgrade anything under lvl 50, which is sad, lucky for me, i placed all my points into ""INT"" and leveled way too fast than what i should of.

-Talking about the ""grinding"" system, you can grind all you want yeah, [u] you can totally waste 18 hours in one single day, just you gonna get hit by the sign [/u] [i] ""LIMITED."" [/i] and once you understand that everything, the caps, the Legendary scrip, your weight, your stash, your C.A.M.P, your gold bullion even your character has limited points and so on and on....
You will change your playstyle

- I would like to say before any complain, [u] that your stash being limited didn't / don't bother me here's why and why it does: [/u] First the game need [b] an economic system [/b], which is why everything is limited, the caps, the gold, your stash, either way everyone can be as rich as they want in under 1hour, just go and farm and stock every single pieces you find, that's really bad but it's also problematic when it comes to HIGH LEVEL, why? because your stash didn't change from lvl 2 to level 600, it's the same, so you gotta keep the same ""worth"" as a lvl 2, im a high level player, yes i got 20 different weapons, yes i got a lot of ammos and scrap, but isn't it's my right and my biggest reward ? i've been doing all that grind just to be restricted and punished for having so much playstyle? shotguns, rifles, energy weapons, melee weapons so many good looking and unique weapons and each of them can be unique just by modding them and you want me to be slapped for having fun with all these guns? 
So yes, being restricted for literally anything you do is VERY frustrating, if you wanna have fun, you gotta ""specialize"" into a class, like rifle only, shotgun, otherwise you gonna be needing a LOT of space which you don't have. Or you can buy...

- FALLOUT 1ST:  never bought it and will never why you ask?
- 15€/month, even Dota plus subscription is 4€/month and i get a LOT more cosmetic/emotes/battle pass rewards.
- So what do we got then: everything inside is BLEH. but the thing ""interesting"" is the UNLIMITED stash, yes you heard me you can get a UNLIMITED stash BUT for your scrap. Nice 15€ monthly to kill an entire server economy, what a great way to balance, remember? you're limited to ""balance"" the economy but for 15€ you can shit on that logic and have 150.000 iron in your stash without any problem. That's not a ""VIP"" right, i just call that cheating.
- 7 player world, laughable, for what you gonna do that, farm even more for your unlimited stash and shit even more on the economical balance in a public server? no thanks.

I personally think that the ""PVP"" is ruining everything in this game, not that i've been killed, nuked, ABSOLUTELY not. Because NO ONE. And again NO ONE wants to fight, you heard that bethesda NO. ONE. in all my hours i've only ran through 2 WANTED people. TWO. no one wants to loose caps WHICH IS LIMITED. over and over. Plus your ""rule"" for engaging pvp are only favorising the one getting hit first. Just please get ride of PVP and turn that game PVE only just like ""warframe"" strangely, they learned to put pvp aside on an arena with rewards wow rewards for pvp. And focus on PVE because if everyones challenge is PVE, you don't need to balance ANYTHING related against players, you can freely remove all the restricted rules, people will trade and not fear against each others, if people could trade skins, oh boy bethesday you don't understand how much people would trade for them for caps or actual money in the game, literraly making a true vendor STASH AS WELL. 

There's too much things to say i don't know where to begin with. The game state is correct but it's very contradictory against himself, he wants you to progress and but don't want you to play too much yet you have to play for daily caps/legendary/gold bullion, yet you are limited YET you are punished for not playing daily. That's a lot of contradiction for a player wanting to play don't you think?

[h1] Random rants and bugs: [/h1]

- Lighting is too random / bugged sometimes at some spot, i don't really have anything to say, the game can be beautiful at a lot of places but it can be HORRIBLE at the same times, it's very weird.
- Hitboxes and server latency, in Fallout 76 you don't really lag, it's more like the bugs between the health of the enemy ping ponging all the f-* time when using any automatic weapon and the invincible enemy, the game is making enemy invincible and fully regen if you one shot them ""too fast"" the server will refill all health, it's very annoying just let me kill that lvl 5 scorched with my 500 dmg rifle like jesus. Or sometimes the numbers are here, the sound is but the health didn't move a single pixel. 
- Energy weapons are pointless to use but they are fun, repairing them cost VERY much, ammos are insane in terms of component aswell, the dmg / output is ok? just there's too much inconsistancy between them
- VATS, never heard a aimbot that fails, here you go, for only 95% with a sniper rifle, you can miss at 5meter away, hey at least it's realist no? i don't ""really"" mind, it's annoying a bit but add that with energy weapon and it's worse
- Every single weapons: the more you use them the more you learn what's wrong with them and all the bugs around that will probably never will be fixed

How to fix most of those restriction / ideas?
- Stop pvp. or make pvp servers, no one ever fight. if you turn the game full pve like warframe you can do so much more without worrying about ""is it balance against players"" please.
- Put all the daily caps / gold bullion / legendary caps WEEKLY, it's a CORE gameplay, you can punish people for not playing your game bethesda, you are making them run away, no one want's to farm for 5month to get a 3 star weapons
OR 
- Increase the limited points of everything, everytime someone reach lvl 20-40-60-100-120... im sure people would love to see their stash being larger and their caps/gold bullion increase as they become more powerful
the higher level you are the more needs you need bethesda, the more you increase the rewards the more people would grind for it, either way being lvl 50 and 9000 doesn't change anything.
Just by increasing anything to like +20 per 20level, i can tell you people would be VERY happy and feel rewarded by grinding all these levels and time put in the game, that would be a good step in the right side.

Special words for anyone saying ""the atomic shop is PAY TO WIN""
First, are you seriously complaining about those scrap box ? you pay for scrap? i don't think so.
atomic points are EASILY obtained, i didn't wasted a single penny in this game BUT from my whole hours with 1 Character they gave me more than 4000 atoms yes the skins cost a lot, but i made +40€ EZ.

0,Fallout 76,69708732,english,"say everything you want, what matters is i'm enjoying this.
Fallout 76 is latest game from bethesda taking place in fallout universe. 

Pros
(+) Exploration. The verticality is enough to make the map feels huge. You can stumble a quest in middle of nowhere.
(+) Character customization. Customize how your character look, your perk, your weapon, even the attachment in your weapon.
(+) Radio. Just like Fallout 4 Radio, it's actually nice to listen to.
(+) Base building. You can place your c.a.m.p everywhere in the world and build your own base however you want.
(+) NPC is back, with wide variety of dialogue too. But it's kinda awkward because some dialogue is locked behind high point of s.p.e.c.i.a.l

Gray
(?) Atoms Shop. It mostly sells only cosmetics and (an useless) collectron to collect junk. People mad about power armor skin being sold because they're already being spoonfeed by mods in the single player game.
(?) Fallout 1st subscription. Sure it lacks of benefit, and bethesda should add more benefit for the subs. But it won't hurt your playthru without the subs. Also if you complain about limited inventory, learn to manage your inventory please.

Cons
(-) Something never changed from fallout.. The freaking green pipboy flashlight. It literally burning people's eyes, and bethesda can't realized how bad it is. Forcing me to use miner's cap for normal color flashlight.
(-) Occasional model sliding bug. Typical Bethesda game.
(-) Bad inventory navigation. It's just meh trying to slap single player inventory management to multiplayer game. hard to navigate.. Especially in Nuclear Winter as this review written.
(-) No Text chat, not sure what's bethesda trying to do here by not adding text chat. The text chat mod in certain site prove that this game plays better with the feature added.

Unpopular opinion:
People who trashing on this game until today is people who follows the hate trend without even playing it. Hurr durr it's bethesda let's get quick money by writting news about every single small controversy they have.",1590301676,1590301676,TRUE,12,1,0.553542435,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,350,37,3061,0,2801,1597118088
1,Fallout 76,67938710,english,"As a Fallout (series) fan, going all the way back to the Classic RPGs, this game is nothing like that, but what it did give me was a bit of the wasteland again, and this time with no annoying voice for my avatar character. Personally I like the silent protganist, it's always better for an RPG to have the main character unvoiced (especially) if you make them yourself.

Pros:
Good exploration, feels like a good Fallout game
Better aiming and shooting.
Better Melee combat than 4, so much better.
Slightly improved Graphics over Fallout 4.
Nice soundtrack as usual.
Fallout with friends...this is what we really wanted guys...and not at a cost.

Cons:
Still buggy, but getting a bit better each day
Lag issues on public servers and some disconnects happen, this is not as bad as launch, but it's still troublesome at times.
Paying for Private servers is kind of crappy, BUT if they allowed us to host our own, such as like a Minecraft server or Rust server, I think many folks would be down to do that, and that should be 0 cost. I can only hope they add this, but for now I am paying for the 1st membership for the right to do a private server.

In closing this game is not Fallout 5, it's not a sequel to anything, it's just another game in the Fallout universe, and it captures that pretty well. So, don't walk into this thinking it will be a perfect romp right out of the vault, but if you are true Fallout fan (not a Bethesda Fan-boy), I think this game has some things to offer.


Additional Review!!
As a follow-up now after 70+ hours and just making it to level 25. Been playing the game with a few friends, so it's been real fun for the 3 of us to go on runs, and do quests together. The game seems to get better each day, and the new updates are making me happy I bought a copy on Steam when it came out. The Wastelanders update, the new roadmap, and the new content coming through the rest of the year looks great.

The other thing on the note of just turning level 25 after 70+ hours, I am an exploration style player, so to some that mean seem a bit long to earn that level, but it was quite rewarding as I was able to use most of a T-45 set, and it finally feels like you can kick butt with armor on. It feels better honestly and it's not easy to find or earn.",1587741830,1590298631,TRUE,1,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,223,25,6968,0,191,1598126174

What got me playing was a free weekend. Most of my other online games are going through a content drought (thanks pandemic) and I was a fan of the series, so I figure I'd give it a go since the price of entry was only the download time.

This game.... plays like Fallout 4. I liked Fallout 4. I like this game. In my time playing, it's had significantly less bugs than Fallout 4, never once a crash. I like that I can share one of my favorite series with friends now, that's really fun. NPC's that you can talk to are in the game, not sure when that was added. Story seems pretty cool so far but I do prefer the Fallout 4 story most of all, right along side Fallout New Vegas. VATS was implimented in what i consider the only fair way to go in a multiplayer game. So, yeah. Fair game, gonna play more now.

15,Fallout 76,69699871,english,"For me, this game is a mixed bag. On one hand, I loved the opening Wayward quest at the beginning, which gets you around level 10. On the other hand, once you complete that quest, you're pretty much stuck with vanilla FO76 until level 20 and well, we all know what people thought of the original game when it came out. For me, the game became a slog between 10-20, but once I hit 20, thats where the good stuff comes.

Wastelanders is a pretty good expansion, it definitely helps fix the various problems this game has. But that doesn't change the fact that there are still tons of bugs in this game, still. Not to mention the disabling of player vending machines, which has been happening pretty much since I bought the game. In fact, it's disabled right now for a duping bug, which was discovered pretty much right after they re-enabled them. 

The actual world of Fallout 76, Appalachia, in my opinion, is the best game world Bethesda has created. There is so much variety in the various zones of the game. It looks gorgeous, despite the graphics being pretty much just Fallout 4. I came in to this game wanting pretty much just a multiplayer Fallout 4 that I could play with friends, and I got that. My biggest gripe with this game, however, is the end game.

The endgame is barely here and in my opinion, it's not fun. My daily routine now with this game is hopping on to do the raider's dailies, a few public events, selling items for caps, and logging off. To me, there really isn't an incentive for the endgame. Sure, there are some really cool weapons and amor you can buy with the endgame currency, but they aren't all that much different from what you can already get in the game world. And once you get what you want to buy, what else is there left to do? Base building is interesting, but its limited by Bethesda in terms of size. Once you hit your CAMP limit, you can't build anything more unless you get rid of some things in your base. Launching nukes is fun, but it's only fun so many times until you're pretty much forced to launch them just so you can craft certain types of ammo.

Don't get me wrong, I really like this game, it's kept me busy during quarantine. But the endgame, to me, is just so...lacking. It feels like something is missing. The game is great when you're doing the Wastelanders main quest, but once you get deep in to the endgame, it just feels so boring. If Bethesda can improve among the endgame, this game will be a genuinely good package. I am still going to recommend the game though, as the endgame, as boring as it can get, is pretty interesting at the start. Launching my first nuke was a really fun experience, killing the Scorchbeast Queen was fun. The starting hours of the Wastelanders expansion is a fun and genuinely great experience.

Obvi they wanted this to be a mulitplayer reliant experience but that just was not happening. The Overseer tapes as a main quest is a super cool idea but the new DLC proves that it should have always been either a side-quest and many other things... 

If you love Fallout you already have this game and can forgive a lot of the differences from previous Fallout games. Like when you smash a bat into a enemies face it feels so stiff and much less dynamic than Fallout 4 and Falloiut 76 just feels super sticky and awkward at times. 

Things I do just totally love about the game is the live experience. You can't pause anymore so lockpicking and hacking is more of a challenge.

I might change my mind if they throw us another 100 hours gameplay which involved NPC, instead of adding some random NPC in the existing quest.

Talking about the game itself the biggest issue besides lacking of content, are the ""C.A.M.P"" system.

47,Fallout 76,69656938,english,"BARELY yes.  However, this thing still needs a TON of work.  One point of major advice:

DO NOT BOTHER WITH THE WORKSHOPS.  You will spent a bunch of caps, you will use a bunch of resources, and then the server will crash, and you will lose ALL that shit, LIKE CLOCKWORK, EVERY TIME.  And no, I'm not talking about losing it when you log out, I'm talking about losing it when their flaky-ass, no-failover backend crashes, which it still does A LOT.

The only other thing to know is that this is not a multiplayer game.  God help you if you see another player; RUN if you see another player.  All they do is make everything respawn and generally F-up your carefully planned sniping mission, because as soon as they enter the area, BLAM, everything just resets.  So one Leroy Jenkins can literally trash the whole map, over and over again.

The reason that is not as much of a problem, in practice, as it sounds like, is that NOBODY IS HERE, which is just as well, because there's no way, and I mean NO WAY, to interact with them.  Oh, please with the emojimacroeroiticons or whatever.  Where the hell is my text chat?  No text chat, you don't have a multiplayer game.

There's exactly one multiplayer mission that works right: one where you escort a Responders robot through a modern city.  THAT is not only fun, it's not a half-bad tactical urban combat simulation.  Cover and move, set up snipers and move, deal with unexpected mayhem-- yeah, THAT one works.  Works GREAT.  But most of them do not.

So: in general, RUN AWAY from other players.  I mean at MAP scale.  You can't do anything interesting with them for the most part, you can't talk to them, you can barely trade with them-- if you want to do this, go to a railroad station and hang out-- and they will reset your dungeons and wreck your planning and progress.

The game still needs a METRIC F-TON of work as a _multiplayer_ game, *BUT*, with recent patches, *IF* you just pretend it's a single-player Fallout title, and play it like one, it is a hell of a lot of fun, it is beautiful, and it is, in many ways, very relaxing.

Oh, and for those of you who like base-building?  Base building works.  You only get one base, but you can pick it up and move it-- without that much hassle, actually.  If you want more than one design on file, there is a blueprinting tool; it's kind of a chore but even if it glitches it will still save you work.  So that has been a very nice surprise.

I'm a huge Fallout fan.  Hell, I was in a fan film.  If you're not that into the franchise, this may not be for you.  And if you're deeply into the multiplayer aspect of MMORPGs, or in particular, if you need to see a LOT of live players all over the world, this is not likely to be your cup of tea.

Pros:
Adventuring and story

Cons:
Limitations set by developers to limit the following just to force you to subscribe to fallout first.

1. Character progression (slightly lower xp gain and high level / more powerful enemies u face late game.
2. Limitation of your stash. you get 800 (in weight) for your stash... and everything in the game has weight... from ammo to food and water.
3. You can't sell or breakdown unneeded stuff such as ammo / crafting plans to vendors. Because the developers don't want you to be too rich.
4. they set a cap limit of 3000 caps. So you can't be too rich.... but items being sold cost up to 100 - 200 caps... 
5. you can encounter a scrap shortage to craft ammo / mid game. because it is hard to kill mobs.
6.World scale to the highest level player in the zone (if you are level 10 and a level 140 join your zone... ""good luck"")
7. You cannot keep workshop areas to farm for mats when you log off. Because the world servers are public servers. sooo the only way to keep it is pay for a private server. You can however keep your CAMP (your main base).

So I was pleasantly surprised to find a lush, semi-populated world, just like any other Fallout offering. I found the Wastelanders quests to be far superior to the standard game quests, so I naturally focused more on them. 

But when I was at about level 6 or 7, I hit a point in the Wastelanders quest line where I couldn't proceed until I reached level 25, forced to only play the original quests until then. At that point the original criticisms of the game became apparent. It no longer felt like Fallout, more like a walking sim set in the Fallout universe. 

Even though I've read from multiple sources that it gets way better once you reach level 25 and are allowed to resume the Wastelanders story, I lost interest around level 15. (I had also just finished Metro: Exodus and STALKER: Call of Pripiyat, so I was kinda burned out on the genre). I do intend to give it another go once I recharge my batteries.

Simple combat (V.A.T.S.) is only mechanic outside of pull trigger or swing bat
Has numerous guides and third person sites to help develop your character in advance
Included NPC's and a storyline? (I should add 'ish) at the end
Beautiful backdrop scenery

Cons:
You aren't faster than any creature above level 9 (even with sprinting)
Enemies don't have to reload, that is a job for players only
No complete one and done respec system
You go through (scaps) faster than you need ie: adhesive is an uncommon drop but a common material to fix armor and upgrade weapons
Healing items are in short supply as you reach level 20

If you have to time to waste on this game to get the items you need to prepare to go out in the world and enjoy fast moving targets speed ratio 2:1 to your 1:1 and can talk friends into playing with you this would be your game. Progress only feels fast until level 10 than it's like you hit a brick wall and climbing a mud hill.

FO76 is a psuedo MMOSRPG with a subscription service that is almost mandatory because the junk stash limit is sad, even as a 1st member I can't keep all of my weapons armor and ammo and run a vendor (when they work half the time) this should have NEVER been implemented into a crafting game.

 The daily grind is also beginning to take it's toll as well, demanding I log every day to hit scrip bullion and cap limits or else I'm behind is annoying and unwarranted. MAKE THEM WEEKLY! This is coming from a fan of your game I love MMOs and the grind but the grind also needs to be fun not a daily routine like going to work. Let me grind my ass off for 20hrs straight and hit that weekly cap and sleep for a day.
 
As for pay2win in the Atom Shop: This isn't entirely true. Yes there are definitely items in the shop that improve QoL, You can earn atoms via daily missions and a huge list of world missions in less than a week to buy the scrap bots and a buttload of repair and scrap kits. I know this because I blew my atoms on a power armor skin then grinded out missions for a week and bought my communist protectron, When you hit endgame however, Atom shop repair kits aren't very interesting anymore and it's all about farming those improved kits from the Scorchbeast Queen(If you don't have the repair perks, Oh man I gotta bone to pick there!) You can easily repair your stuff for the cheap cheap.

 Finally for my biggest personal gripe with this game is the perk card setup. It is not fun nor immersive when I have to slot cards everytime I want to craft, forage, or shoot at something. For the love of god and all that is holy remove skill based perks from using slots or at least make those perks consume 1 slot where you can level up the skill by doing those actions like any other MMO with a crafting system on the market!

 As much as I am personally enjoying this game (I must be a masochist) I can't give it the thumbs up until QoL picks up in this game, limiting how much a player can carry is one thing, but limiting how much stuff they can store away for future use is ludicrous, It's also too time consuming stopping to slot perk cards to do pretty much anything in this game, and it's so rage rage inducing when you don't have a crafting card equipped, especially when you spend a ton of scrip on legendary modules and you didn't have super duper equipped when crafting those new legendary weapons.",1590155926,1590155926,FALSE,2,1,0.545454562,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,22,1,16276,0,14035,1591323317

[b] The Good [/b]

- [b] Visuals [/b]look VERY OKAY. I want to say ""Good"" but that's not really the case. In many locations it will look breathtaking but in others, utter crap. 

- Combat is exactly like what you would expect from Fallout. If you don't like it then don't even try. I myself had to try several builds before i settled on a suppressed combat rifle sneaky build.

- World is huge and the events and how the ingame economy works keeps it interesting enough.

- Love the monster variety. Had a blast running around and exploring with friends and we are still nowhere near done. 

- [b] MUSIC and ambient Sound[/b] is top notch. It appropriately sets the mood for the entire game with some really nice pieces that work together with the visuals and the story telling to create some truly memorable moments. 

[b] The BAD [/b]

-Subscription [b] BS [/b]. At first I really didn't think Fallout 1st was a big deal but after playing 30 hours in standard servers I joined my friends private world and the difference was HUGE.
[list]
    [*] You don't have to fight for resources. No waiting around or changing servers over and over again for that one item you need but so does everyone else.
    [*] Fallout 1st peeps will ALWAYS have more resources than you, better loot than you (if they are willing to farm a bit) and be basically be superior in every way. 
    [*] Monsters will be nearer to your level meaning lower difficulty. Example: Just yesterday I did a mission in the wendigo cave. Most monsters were around level 30 (I was 35) as I was in a private world. Switched over to Standard, the basic mob creatures started from level 52 and only went higher. Ripped me a new Ahole in my pretty power armor. 
[/list]
I say this but I enjoy the game enough to get at least buy 1 month's F1st sub myself as well and do whatever I need to before it runs out (Farm cores, resource, ammo etc) but it still is a really  scummy tactic from bethesda. 
You will hear many people downplay its value for some strange reason but that's not the case. After trying for yourself you can easily tell the difference. 

- There are still some issues. Private worlds getting DCed and not allowing others to rejoin. Respawning bugs and glitches that make you loose HOURS of progress etc. 

- Hate how the quests progress even when each team member is at the same step. You will have to go and interact with objects and people by yourself even when team leader has done it. Such a retarded mechanic. 

- Horrendous weight management. 90% of the time my main concern is not getting over encumbered rather than the 10 level higher monster that has respawned because a higher level player accidentally passed by the mission area. 

[b] The Verdict [/b]

Maybe its the quarantine getting to me but I really enjoy the game (despite all these issues). At times it's hard, too much even, at times beautiful and at times just plain dumb.

0,Fallout 76,69588267,english,"This is a good game (when you have friends and don't have to pay for infinite storage space)!  After playing this for way too many hours I'm going to give it a negative review now that all my friends left the game and I've gotten bored.

Because of the pandemic going on, I have way too much time on my hands and decided to play this.  I bought it at full price and instantly regretted it about 3 hours into the game playing it solo.  The Wastelanders update is cool and all, but once your friends leave to play another game, this game has nothing else for me to do once I finished all the quests and side quests with them.  The grind for better loot and the ""special"" currency is not worth it when they put a timer on how much you can grind per day...seriously?  I've become so bored and unmotivated to keep grinding for crap loot that I've become a random encounter for other players giving them supplies and legendaires since I can't put them in my storage.  

Talking about storage. Another thing to note is the scrap box (the infinite junk storage) that I've been wanting but don't think that I should pay a monthly fee of $15 or a yearly subscription of $100.  Managing junk is the most tedious thing to do and to carefully manage what junk I should keep and what should I sell to keep my space organized is a chore and a half and I fucking hate it.  Good thing I had a friend who bought the yearly subscription because he absolutely hated to 800 lbs storage space limit and I've been sending ALL of my junk to him so I can have space for all my other weapons, armor and ect.  

If this were a free to play game, then sure! I wouldn't mind spending money for an infinite scrap box, but this isn't.  This game feels like it should be free to play with the microtransactions, monthly fees, poor graphics and numerous glitches that still make me fall out of the map even after the update.  Games like this should not have this at all in the first place for it's asking price!  I don't spend money to buy a game to find out about microtransactions or monthly/yearly fees to make the game more tolerable to play.  I'd rather play Fallout 4 with mods and I will after writing this.",1590131586,1590131586,FALSE,1,0,0.500661671,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,34,3,20455,0,20022,1593832985

18,Fallout 76,69553250,english,"I started after Wastelanders was released.  Playing through the original content I enjoyed how Bethesda was able to tell a pretty solid story with no direct interaction with human NPCs.  There is a great Fallout story here. I dig it.  Wastelanders expanded on this story and love them or hate them we now have human NPCs to interact with.

Combat is decent. Anyone whose played FO3, NV, or 4 will get used to it pretty quickly.  The whole stable of  Fallout weapons are here and they are expanding where they can, though I feel like eventually they will run out of room here.  The weapons work much like their FO4 counterparts and non-VATS shooting feels better than any title before it.

CAMP building is fun, and useful, and I know I've spent a lot of time tweaking things in my camp, planning  or wondering where to find plans to make my camp just perfect. It also may have pulled some of my attention away when I am not playing the game.

On the down side... Bugs! Dang this game is buggy.  Even by Bethesda standards, FO76 gives any other Bethesda title a run for it's money on bugs and inconsistent bugs, and ""we patched this, but in doing so created these bugs!""

CAMP bugs, Appalachia is very uneven, and finding a spot where you can place everything in your camp without terrain clipping through, or weird errors where the item you want to place snaps to the other items placed, but still doesn't have ""support"" can get frustrating. **Oh, and I've purchased the camp stove plan, why can't I build it?** just to name a few.

The grind that is synonymous with ""endgame"" MMOs rears its terrifying head with Wastelanders.  Grind for rep, grind for currency, grinding grinding ugh.  While I would be ok with the grind per se,as the gameplay is fun, there is too little variety in the grind.  Mix it up. Have me fetch something Monday and blow something up on Tuesday. Anything.

I haven't subscribed to Fallout 1st as of the writing of this review.

My only negative experience was my first (and only) attempt to take over a workshop and build something in an Adventure world (which was my first mistake). I cleared out all of the NPC enemies and fought off NPC invaders without issue. This workshop was in the middle of nowhere (in my opinion), so I thought other players would ignore me.
I was wrong.
I was level 8. He was level 94. He initiated a hostile takeover of the workshop, killed me in less than a second, and then repeatedly tea-bagged my corpse. God, he was a thorough tea-bagger. It was only after (I assume) my corpse was positively glistening with his scrotal sweat that he became bored and left. The worst part? He didn't care about, or need, my building.

47,Fallout 76,69553180,english,"Avoided the game like the plague due to it's laughably disasterous launch, however I purchased it recently after hearing the ""Wastelanders"" update improved the game significantly.

Don't regret it whatsoever, am having a lot of fun.  The atmosphere is tremendous, you truly feel as if you're living in a post-apocalyptic world.  It feels like a single player game so far, I rarely come across other players, but that's okay.  If anything, it makes the game feel more realistic, because in a true post-apocalyptic world you shouldn't be seeing other people nonstop all day/night long.  Usually you ""hear"" other players more than you see them, such as gunshots in the distance for example.  

The quests are dynamic and feel the same as other Fallouts, they aren't ""Go here and kill X mongbats"" like in many other multiplayer games.  

The fact that you can't save/reload your game adds an admitably interesting mechanic, as you sometimes have to think carefully about the dialogue options you choose when speaking to an NPC since you can't take them back, or whether attacking an outpost of enemies is a good idea or not, etc.  (knowing you can simply reloading your game if doesn't doesn't go well)  

Am level 12 with 24 hours in, so haven't seen 90% of the game, but even if I quit right now I've already gotten my money's worth.  (I see people who are level 250+, so obviously there is a lot to do)  

If you're looking for an MMO this isn't your game.  However, if you're looking for another classic Fallout experience, I'd give it a go.

53,Fallout 76,69231045,english,"Edit:

After getting past the aggravating start, the game definitely isn't perfect. However it is nice to play the Fallout gameplay cycle with friends. Do not expect the same polish or quality of storytelling/gameplay that would be found in the single-player Fallout games. This is definitely a more watered down experience compared to the others. But they did remove the crappy up/down/left/right dialogue options of Fallout 4 in favor of the traditional dialogue boxes, which I have to commend Bethesda for.

One of the best things I have to say about this game is that it seems to have one of the most chilled out player communities I've ever seen. There are virtually no griefers and everyone seems incredibly cordial, helpful, and willing to share essential items to get you started.

Edit:

I finally managed to get into the game. And what a goddamn mess. Damage to enemies takes a few seconds to register, so even while they are technically dead they can still damage you. The game gives you virtually no instruction on the crafting, perk system, hunger/thirst system, cooking, challenges or anything. So you're stuck spending the first few hours learning the gameplay systems while you starve to death because you didn't even realize there was a hunger/thirst system. Then there's the broken Perk/Level system. For some reason, equipping a Perk to a slot will add a Level point to that Perk Tree, and this happens without the game ever telling you or mentioning it prior. So while you're browsing Perk cards that you own and equipping them, the game is wasting all of your Perk points and putting it into Charisma which is useless in this game. And what's even worse, with a RTX 2080, this game runs at an average of 40 FPS. How is this even a product?

Original:

Start the game, try to load in 6 times with varying issues (Title not loading, No Ping, Servers down etc.). Finally get into the game 30 minutes after starting. Deal with the broken and aggravating character creation for an hour. Audio subsequently crashes, so you run through the entire intro with no audio or subtitles hoping that it will save the character you just spent an hour on. Go to reload the game and try more than 6 times again with the same varying issues. Load into the game, and find that the game has completely deleted your character that you spent more than an hour creating. Go to refund the game; you have spent more than 2 hours playing this game, your refund is ineligible.

Bethesda are scammers. The only ""gameplay"" I've seen in my two hours that makes my refund ineligible are loading screens, failed launches, crashes, and the worst character creation I've ever seen in any game.

1. + 2. 
The game is a 1:1 copy of the console version! Aim-assist, horribly controls (espaically in building mode) and the sadest thing.. u cant change the keybinds to your likings.. unbelievable....

3. 
Serverperformance is ridiculous, u need multiple shots to kill an enemy just because the health jumps up again because the server didnt register the hits and ignores the damage u made.. very bad with fast shooting guns...

4. More a personal opinion:
When u play the game u always play, from minute 1, the minigame -- inventory manager 76.
U need tons of materials and u cant story them.. ONLY if u pay real Money! ...than its no ploblem with inventory limitation :/

If this would be a Singleplayer Fallout I would love it. The map is one of the best in the series and it's tons of fun to discover all the locations. But the online Multiplayer is no fun! There is almost no benefit expect playing with a friend. Furthermore a lot of bugs and performance issues stops the fun sometimes.

People complaining about storage just have no brain on how to organize their shit and what to keep. I'm around level 70 and I have 0 problems with stash space. I guarantee you the people who complain about space have random shit in it.

91,Fallout 76,69485490,english,"I know there are lots of questions about this game in your mind. I had them too until free weekend. I tried it and bought the game. The reason behind it is not very simple. Let's read what I think.

Not even close to be a masterpiece. Not good for pvp yet. Not a good survival game nor a good role-playing game. What is it then? It is the mixture of everything above.  I knew that this game's release was too harsh on players who bought it at that point. Yes, they are right and still lot's of bugs, exploits and unbalanced mechanism of player interactions. I would like to rate this game in four categories such as single-player, multi-player, technical, and overall. 

Singleplayer:

I wouldn't recommend Fallout 76 to any player who wants to play Fallout series as single-player game. Why? Because quests are so simple, too repeating game play. You have to pay for single-player experience or private server experience with friends as co-op. Except your base and your quest line, everything on map belongs to server and it will reset everything else, once you logged out from the server or quit the game. Only plus of this game for single-player experience is that you usually feel alone and you encounter different events during your game play as other Fallout games.
Rate: 4/10

Multiplayer:

I wouldn't recommend Fallout 76 to any player who wants to play Fallout series as multi-player game too. It's not a good game for competitive online gaming genre. There is no balance between players until you have the same level which is nearly impossible until end-game. Pvp is really bad in this game and seems it's not possible to be fixed. Best way to play this game as multi-player game is to play with your friends but still higher level player can come and kill you easily. There is no strong reward for killing someone in this game and it takes time to reach someone so it's not as easy as in GTA V.

Rate: 3/10

Technical: 

Same textures, animations, items, etc. from Fallout 4 are there. Server system is okay. You can find other players to interact more often than other survival, crafting games but there is a reason to find them or interact with them? I found many reasons to interact them but in this game I couldn't make any friends but enemies. I don't know what is the reason under this kind of an act but players prefer not interacting with you.

There are lots of bugs and some exploits in this game which made selling items through vendors to other players banned. You can't sell any item with vending machines because of one exploit right now. I hope they will fix it as other bugs which still occurs. 

Rate: 5/10

Overall:

This is where I can recommend this game to people. It may not be a good single-player game nor multi-player game but it's a good mixture of it so if you buy this game expect some experience between. You will mostly play it co-op with your friends or single-player themed Fallout and see other players around. You can get killed time to time or kill other players for your own purposes and continue playing it alone or co-op.

I can only recommend this game if you can play a game not less than 2 hours when you sit in front of it. Most of your playing time can be undone because of quitting the game. Anything that you do on map except your camping area and quest lines, will be the products that you gained from map, anything else will be undone. So it's better to play longer hours to get those products from what you built. Grinding is there and it's there because of this punishing system.

I actually gave in and bought a 2070 super a week ago and I thought there was something wrong with my card when playing this game. the texture popping and artifacting when overloading vram into shared ram looked exactly like artifacting from a bad overclock. Also as a side not the ultrawide support on this game is a bit wonky at times but not unforgivably so.

Moving aside from the horrid leaking and performance, the actual gameplay gets a bit too much hate as I went into the game expecting to want to refund it as i missed the free week. Much to my delight I accidentally played 10 hours straight before thinking to check what time it was. and the map feels extremely huge. The only big gripes i have is with how rare it is to find basic recipes and, comically high cap placed on some of the items, and the really low weight limitation on the stash. *Do you really expect me to pay a monthly fee for unlimited space and features im not going to use?*

1.  Bethesda server management is garbage.  Delayed maintenance times with no continue notification to their  player base just equals bad service in my opinion.  Even a simple ""Maintenance time has been extended due to new issues would go miles""
2.  Bugs galore.  Quests not spawning in NPC's to turn into, multiple crashes, or getting stuck in walls and the list goes on.
3.  Weapons/Armor cater to basically one play style.  I know you can do whatever you want, but the effectiveness goes from being broken OP to you might as well be throwing gum.  No game can perfect balance and I get that but this is not even close.
4.  Forced Longevity.  Rather than creating fun content to earn longevity, they cap how much caps, scrips and gold you can earn in a day.  Not that capping is the issue itself it's the low quantity that's capped.  Do one event and pick up everything and sell it, boom caps capped.  Sell all the legendaries you have in your stash till you hit scrips cap, turn in 20 of the 1000 treasury notes you have for gold cap.  20min of playing and you can't do anything else.  Time to move to a new character, but there is no shared inventory so you have to rely on a friend to transfer stuff for you.

60,Fallout 76,69432635,english,"Having seen how badly this game was handled at release and all the subsequent and continued negativity thrown at it because of unfavourable design choices  I always avoided considering this game.  BUT it appeared on steam recently and with the recent wastelanders update, the game finally appeared to show some promise. 

CUT to the recent free weekend and I decided to give it a go, nothing to lose other than disk space! Well I was so surprised how much I would I enjoy the game, clocking in around 25 hours during the 4 days (including a couple of late nights!) It convinced me enough to shell out on it.

TBH I have always struggled with the fallout games, I always end up with several false starts and not getting drawn in before another game catches my attention but Fallout 76 has managed to pull me in with it's ""just one more location before I log off"" gameplay loop. 

The game world has loads of varied locations and offers tons for the budding explorer to do and see. It is really put together well and provides a nice playground for some gun totting, axe wielding and general blowing shit up fun! The levelling system is done well with perk cards allowing for different set ups depending on what your into or require. Building is simple but currently I have only built a basic base (you are restricted on how many items can be placed to make you base with a budget limit).  It actually plays alright on my ancient potato too! (i5 750 - yes 12 year old 1st gen, don't laugh/cry!, 12gb ram and 6gb 1060)

On the negative side it can be a bit janky with the combat and enemy AI (but hey I have played and enjoyed Pirahna Bytes games!) I have had a couple of hard crashes (prob my aged hardware) and seen a couple of bugs - unable to zoom with scope and unable to close the quick item wheel, but nothing too game breaking. 
Another small  issue but only at a personal is that I am having to turn off my OCD klepto pick every bit of shit up impulse! Due to limited space, inventory management and sensible loot strategy is a must. Only pick up what you need for crafting matts or what you plan to sell  (items can be tagged in game which provide matts you require so you know what to leave behind), still need to pull my socks up in this department though ;) 

There is a bit of food/drink management but it is not too hardcore to be detrimental to the game experience.

One contentious issue is the store and fallout 1st sub. The store is cosmetic stuff in the main, other than some repair kits (not required in the slightest) and a robot that collects junk (gimme!), nothing worth moaning about and each to their own if they want to shell out on some bling. Note you can earn the atoms currency for the shop by just playing, so you don't have to part with cash, so far i think i have over 800 - that will be my junk collecting friend taken care of :D Also there appears to be the odd bit of crap free in the shop from time to time.

With regard to fallout 1st, I won't touch it with a barge pole and from what i can tell with a bit of careful inventory management it's not making much difference anyway. I have not had any problems so far playing on the public servers in all my time (playing solo adventure mode).

We have seasons on the horizon, potentially free (at least debut season)  but possibly going to cost based on other games that seem to have adopted this model like the plague. Also as shown with TESO and the ingame shop here, Bethesda do like to squeeze the wonga from you, so bear that in mind.

So if your in the mood for a fallout flavoured sandbox on a huge map where you can explore and adventure your tits off, this game might surprise you, it did me! I didn't expect it to be quite as good as it is, but I have had plenty of bang for my quid so far, I suggest you judge it on it's own merits and not on what has come before and maybe give it a chance you might be surprised like me!

I love that you can find crafting recipies out in the world and they can be learned by scrapping but the really good ones you will need to pay for at venders.

Npc can drop items from the cashshop, i looted a atom gasmask yesterday and quests can reward you with cashshop currency.
 
Most of the charaters i have found so far is done very well and the voice acting and stories are good, fun or atleast better than i found them to be in fallout 4.

There is a radiostation on the pipboy that have a talking host and plays awsome music to get you in the moode, I like her but they should add more she can say because it will get tiresome to lissen to her and the 10 diffrent tracks she plays if it even is that much.

I am not happy with the food and drink bares going down WAY to fast but so far i have had enoughf food and water to surport it but it do feel like u need to drink water every 5 min especially if use are useing melee combat and for the love of god why the hell ain't there an option to keep the bars for food and water on your hud permently? and why can the questlog on screen blok them from view ? 

To make hunger much less of a problem use the mod called ""Good with Salt"", at rank 3 reduces the rot timer for your food items by 90% fx. when you mix tato and water you get tato juce which also recives the bonuse, this mod is found under Luck. 
Another mod that goes well with this is ""Thru-Hiking"" under Agility which reduces the weight of food items with 90% at rank 3.

At lv 17 i was fighting mostly lv 1 mobs, some are lv 5 and very few have been lv 10 which i found wired.  

At lv 33 some lv 50 flying winged scorched beast was spawned at a spot where i was surposed to find a pack of wolfs ...

At lv 48 at the end of the ""Wolf questline"" i spawned a lv 70 *** invisible assultatron with friends, I would had liked the game to warn me that this is actually a group event I am about to start.

Needless to say it felt lame that you are able to start an event with no hope of compleating it at lv 48 and I thought my chance at succeeding was wasted...
But I later learned you can do this multible times after farming the mats to create the keycard needed to start the event.

At lv 61 I had 1 legendary lv50 flying scorchbeast and 2 normal spawn on me, I was not able to make even a dent in any of them, died 2 times trying to get away from them, you get chain staggered at that makes it hard to run.

Now you should think the level of encounters is tired to the area you are exploring but that is not the case.

We can hope this will be fixed in the future when they make all you fight the same level as you.

Running quest with a mate is hopeless because its only possible for one of you to compleat the task or you both have to chose to enter your own solo area which in my oppinion is lame, this is in no way fallout 4 with co-op but running events or spawming special mobs with friends is alot of fun.

Useing the option Pacifist in the game option do NOT make you unkillable by other players, well geared high level players can kill you with out breaking a sweat and they can attack your campsite and sleep in your bed or even block your workbenches so you will have to wait in line to use it. 

I have changed the the keymapping for my game so i do not know if the issue is there on default keybindings but when i first had to place my C.A.M.P. pressing the button listed on the screen would only rotate and not place it, i have to press enter to place any thing in build mode.

In my oppinion this game is clearly made for console and then ported to pc and its horrible done being forced to use Z and C and Enter to select is a really bad choice would had been better if X was used instead of Enter. many times my char start running off because X is the keybinding for autorun and i can not get my head around moveing the hand to the ohter end of the keyboard.

Further more i have found many times the UI dont work like it is surposed to fx. useing space for tradeing with ohter players or pressing it to accpeting trades from players just do not show up as an option on the screen from time to time, same goes for picking crops, looking on the screen you can clearly see the fruit on the plant and the game showed the promt to press the interact key to pick it up but nothing happens, this have never been a problem on my PS4 Pro where i find the game to work with no issues at all. 

So far i am starting to lean toward NOT RECOMMEND buying the game on PC because of interface problems and the horrible forced keybindings which is destroying my game expirence on the PC version.

As time progressed i am starting to learn to live with the problems and just use the mouse pointer instead to select in most menus and this do work.

Joined 1st service today, i bought it though steam, the same as my fallout 76, and when i logged into the game 2 min later everything was there, cashshop items and cash and i could join my own server too, have read about loads of players haveing problems i had NONE!

Main reason i joined the service was i wanted to make sure the items i want to farm is acutally there when i log into a world server and already picked clean by other players, stash with unlimited scrap space witch do anoy me alot, this should be in the game for FREE!!

And last but not least ... the only bugs i have found so far playing the game (around 100 hours now) are the ones descriped in this review, I have had no problems with quests or anything else so far and i am haveing a blast in this game i am hopeing by pouring cash into the pockets of Bethesta will in time provide us with more content.

At lv 50 you have to chose to get at perk card OR move a point from one stat to another, which is compleatly lame, so far the bundles have either given me perks i have already maxed out or crap i have abselutly no use for.
Now at lv61 i am still missing loads of the perks i want and some of the ones i do have is not maxed out, I am looking forward to get 30 levels more befor I actually have the build i want. 
the level many of the perks is locked behind is crap forcing you to make picks you dont want and later you have to earn levels to move the points around ... this is a MAJOR TURN OFF!

This is main reason why i changed my recommendation to NOT RECOMMENDING the game, i was at 200 hours playtime and I had not gotten the stats or the perks the way i want them and was i starting to get the feeling i would have finished all the content befor actually playing with the build I want from level 1!!!!

I have now shifted my oppinion back to RECOMMENDING the game, leveling is eazy as hell when you learn the ropes of the game, make sure to get perks like Tenderizer3, BloodyMess3 and Adrenaline at atleast rank 1 as soon as you can, these will change how fast you kill stuff beyond belive, I am now hunting for the tuff mobs instead of awoidiing them and I am only useing weapon perks at rank 1 and my weapons is only 1 stared.

The game mecanichs of the mobs trying to evade your shots while gaining ground to you is amazing, mobs will twich, crouch and run for cover after the first shot rings out, they reacts diffrent to being hit by diffrent weapon types, many variations how limb dammage effect them when trying to get to you.

Loads of colorfull NPCs, funny stories and with an odd tvist too...

One important thing i will say though, if you dont want to pay for 1st membership DO NOT Buy the game, the benifits of your own server, tent and unlimited scrap box is INSANE when you farm stuff, no one to compeat with for the loot or the mobs as they spawn !

At the same time within your first hour you'll have a moment and think out loud ""oh wow this is a real fallout"".

I've cried twice and screamed more times than I can count. What made this game an accidental jewel? The devs built the game at launch where the world was the only character and then with Wastelanders built a cast of characters on top of it. The world building done for this game is something that is once in a life time.

The game play is amazing when held up against any mmo period. The combat is real and fluid and you can build just about anything you can think up. V.A.T.S. has changed and while the offline system was better it's just not something that's going to work in a MMO. While the slow motion skull shots will be missed the system still functions adding a tactical layer of limb targeting, crits, and auto aim for the duration. I actually enjoy playing my character under the current system more than I did in Fallout 4. Having no way to pause the game adds a level of intensity that was just simply not there before as well. 
Last night for an example of all this I was taken by surprise by a missile. I dodged it. Not some auto roll, not some dumb line of sight shit, I dodged it as it came flying at my face and heard it go hissing past my ear. 

In case a MMO with simply the best world ever crafted and quake quality fps elements wasn't enough this game ends up feeling like a sandbox and while you only drop junk you drop all of your crafting materials when you die. PvP can be found and is 99% consensual but you will die and you will drop your stuff and need to come back before someone picks it up.

On the social front playing instruments gives you buffs and you can build you own movable C.A.M.P. this lets you craft a movable base and or battle fortress and yes there are perks for fortifications. What this boils down to is people hopping around these movable camps and shops. Fallout 76 is by nature a tad antisocial but there are people doing stuff all the time and generally bumping into each other. You can hear fire fights from miles off so if you are nearby another player it sounds like WWIII and is impossible to miss. There is also nothing to stop a group of players from setting up their settlements near each other and having a little town.
Voice chat is also huge and players often wander past singing along to the radio and btw all the radios play the same songs at the same time across all devices on the server.

I like the game mainly for its vast beautiful territories to explore, events, crafting and I guess its in-game economy comparing to Fallout 4 and Elder Scroll Online where I didn't really have any motivation to craft or do any camp development at all. 

Based on the reviews, it feels that NPCs and quests were major game changers introduced in Wastelanders. I can now see how that can be the case.

3,Fallout 76,69424774,english,"Recommended for fans of Bethesda's Fallout games. Oh Fallout 76... I desperately wanted this game to be great. I kept up with the development and was 100% going to pre-order, and then the BETA happened. Glaring issues, bugs, and a lackluster open world kept my money in my pocket. Fast-forward a year, the Wastelanders update goes live and I play for a free weekend. After 40 hours I'm level 25 and honestly having a great time, I grabbed the game for $30 and have no interest in micotransactions or Fallout 1st.

Sadly, times 1998 you buy game and its works are gone.

2018 it seems like some years are required.



Well, we all know the development story, a modern day has to deal with modern day issues, so needs longer to be ready, yes Fallout 76 did take its time. Despite all the very entertaining jokes and memes, is actually a very good always on Fallout 4.


We have seen a lot of other broken and abandoned projects, but fallout 76 actually does deliver what it promises, even if it took quite some time. Maybe games that don't launch on steam are some kind of paid alphas and betas.

Problem is today a lot games get rushed and abandoned.
It does not matter how hard you screw up, it does matter if it gets done.

Its always clear where problems are, but not all developers do fix bugs and gameplay.

Some downsides, You can carry like 160 kg, max loot to storage  800kg is reach fast as weapons weight like 5kg, you can daily max sell items for 1400 money and some cant sell at all LOL. 


Honestly the jokes are really epic fun^^.

62,Fallout 76,69390277,english,"I was so fucking excited, and did get some beta in on this game, and it was absolutely disappointing. Empty, boring, broken-ass closeup graphics with mega motion blur and poor FOV/depth of field, it made me sick to play for even a few hours.

As recently as a few weeks ago I've made fun of people on forums / discord for playing it, booing it on ads, commenting snarky remarks under their sponsored ads, etc.

But I did long for the days of New Vegas or Fallout 4, decided I might replay one of them when suddenly the free weekend came around. I thought I'd at least give it a try, see if the NPCs make the difference, how the graphics look now, and try it with my fiancee instead of alone.

This game now, on the whole, is fixed in my eyes. If you told me a few years ago ""hey, you can play FO4 on a new map with a friend or two"" I would jump for joy, and i know that many fallout fans would say the same. I let the vile internet effect seep into my brain and poison me against something that I honestly genuinely knew I could probably like. 

I made a mistake. Don't jump on the ""this game is garbage"" bandwagon like I had (commenting on trailers that you'll never play it, etc) - it's boring. it's not original, and it actually comes across as ignorant to feel like you're important enough to warrant thinking anyone cares about your negative opinion. it's also HELLA IGNORANT to act like something is beneath you even TRYING it, especially if you call yourself a fan. before i tried this game i think i was way too jaded, heard bad hype, and didn't want to give in to the ""ohhh we fixed it, don't worry!"" vibe. By trying, in error, to not conform to the people who were saying it was good, I was bandwagoning with the even lamer side of ""People are saying this is good so with 0 recent frame of reference I am going to argue that it is bad."" It makes me slightly embarassed to think of now, because I know for a fact that I tend to do that with TV/Movies/Games yet I didn't even stop to think that I might be making the same mistake again.

it's not fallout 300,000. the graphics look like brushed up fo4 graphics, the FOV default is nightmarishly low to begin with which is why i spent the first 4 hours feeling like my eyes were broken - set it to 90. turn the depth of field down ALMOST all the way. now you're just playing fallout 4, with new characters (loveable npcs really do make all the difference) new areas, less scrounging for ammo and more shooting guys who MIGHT ACTUALLY kill you.

Things can change. People, and studios because of it, are inherently flawed. What they did, though, was not go ""HEY FUCK YOU"" and never fix it - they listened, and slowly they fixed it. Bethesda is now like any other AAA studio and super in it for the moolah, but you've gotta give Todd some credit, he did the dirty and didn't love the response he got but in the end they jumped on and improved the things that didn't work, and polished the things that did.

The CAMP system is really cool, I love that you can't REALLY get into too much PVP unless you agree to it - and your stash is always safe, only you can access it. Worst case scenario some assholes decide to blow up your camp while you're off running around, it's a learning experience for placing more turrets next time, or for just leaving your camp completely open to the public - if you don't store much in other containers / don't have anything actively mining you're not up to lose too much.

So far in about 20 hours I've met 4-5 other people, all of whom gave me gifts, showed me where the good stuff on the level was / cap stashes / got me to follow them to large events where they mowed down all the baddies for us. Not one real person (aside from when I had a 10 cap bounty on me for government supply theft) has shot at me, or even moved toward me in a threatening manner. Most people make liberal use of the in-game emotes, with less voice chat as far as I've seen - which is honestly my preference so I'm into it!

If you're THINKING about trying the game, because you loved Fallout 3 / 4 / NV - I recommend giving it the benefit of the doubt. If you think you hate it but have never played it, and are just bandwagoning because of word of mouth - rethink your stance. Maybe being ""non-mainstream"" is just as mainstream, but kinda boring and tiresome?

63,Fallout 76,69390259,english,"If you've ever dreamed of playing a co-op Fallout game then this is definitely for you. I bought this game a week after Wastelanders so I do not have a bitter taste from the shitshow this game used to be. I believe people need to be open minded and support things that are good for the game like Wastelanders. Saying that the past is unforgivable defeats the purpose of trying to improve the game, because of course they are improving it to enlarge the player base. Making your game a good game is a great way of expanding your player base. I just want to disclose that I would not have bought this game is it was not multiplayer and I do play this game in a team with 2 other friends. I am not at all interested with the singleplayer only games that came before this. Just wanted to announce that possible bias that I may have towards this game. 

There are still some problems in this game though:
- Fallout 1st: It needs to be removed. I can defend its price if it was just the private worlds as anyone who runs servers knows how expensive it is to run servers, even if just for 8 people. However, the private worlds should be the only Fallout 1st feature. You will eventually run out of stash space in this game and Fallout 1st is the only way to get infinite scrap space. This is a ridiculous Pay-To-Win tactic that should not be supported. I talked about supporting good parts of the game. This is not like that. DO NOT ENTERTAIN BETHESDA'S BULLSHIT BY BUYING FALLOUT 1ST. Use your money to show Bethesda what works and what doesn't. Luckily I've been good enough with inventory management to not need to give in to this blatant cash grab.

- Bugs: This is definitely not as bad as the base game pre Wastelanders. If I were to pull a number out of my ass, I'd say only 1-5% of enemies will be glitched. Sometimes the NPCs at your camp have weird animations especially when trying to sit but this doesn't annoy me too much. 

- Atomic Shop: I personally do not care if what is being sold in the Atomic shop is low quality. This is not like a mobile game where its impossible to grind the currency, forcing you to buy it with real money. It's very easy to get atoms. I'm a noobish player of this game and it isn't hard and I do not think anything in the atom shop is Pay-To-Win. Still, DO NOT PAY REAL MONEY FOR ATOMS. If Bethesda sees that microtransactions are being well received they may start added Pay-To-Win aspects to the atom shop to further entice people to buy. Look, if you buy atoms, you're a cheater. If you buy Fallout 1st, you're a cheater. Simple as that. Grind like everyone else.

Like I said before I did not play this game before Wastelanders so I'm fairly new and someone more experienced might be able to correct what I'm saying. However, I think this game is able to pull a No Man's Sky, and I hope it does cause I've always wanted a co-op Fallout game. My first impressions of this game have been pretty good. 

I give this game a 7.5/10. If they just get rid of Fallout 1st or make it private servers only, give everyone infinite scrap space in their stashes/add a perk or grind for more stash space through leveling up, and remove atomic shop microtransactions, I'll definitely bump up score to an 8.5 or 9/10. This game has really good potential, but mismanagement doesn't care about potential as we've seen before. Hopefully that bullshit phase is done with.

78,Fallout 76,69338597,english,"Requirements to enjoy this game:
1. A good computer, the game does skip and have micro freezes and performance issues.  Take it or leave it, can't do sh!t about it.  It's a gorgeous game and is run on an always connected network that constantly runs checks and balances and controls everything from mobs to loot.  The performance issues will most likely never go away, they are baked in.

2. This game is set in the survival genre, keep in mind you must manage your character's needs, the stuff you're carrying and there's a lot of weight management involved.  If that's not for you then really think about it, good chance this isn't for you.

My initial review was actually a thumbs down until I thought about the game in the context of a survival genre setting.  People need to keep in mind this is a SURVIVAL game.  You must manage weight, you must manage inventory and stash, you must constantly eat and drink, you must thinking about what you're doing.  Decide you're going to ignore your thirst meter and been unlucky with your water finds?  Might be dead, should have stayed mindful.

Fallout 1st is unnecessary and essentially a cheat as far as the unlimited junk/crafting item box thing goes.  You're meant to manage that weight, this isn't a single player story driven game just for you, it's a tougher survival and management experience.  If that's not for you and you don't like that, cool, absolutely nothing at all wrong with that.  Play the older Fallout games or one of the Elder Scrolls games or wait for a new installment of either of those series.

As far as the cosmetic micros and repair kit sales go, the cosmetics are silly extras, I personally don't care about them.  The repair kits they sell, that's definitely questionable.

Wasted hours collecting resources caps etc to make or buy bullets but the enemies are bullet sponges and then your weapon breaks and you die.
OK not quite that bad but compared to the fallout games before this online attempt it is simply garbage in comparison.
The worst aspect is simply that you never get better. In the original games your weapons were not the best but could be upgraded....yes here you can do that as well. However in the other fallout games the improvements were direct and notable.. Here your enemy levels up with you so the weapon is basically the same.  The fluidity of movement in this game reminds of the joke about being asked why are you pulling that piece of string. The reply is ""Have you tried Pushing string"" That about sums up my opinion about movement in this game.  Movement when fighting is simply horrendous. Why have I managed 91 hours if I hate it so much? Because I simply loved the previous fallout games and keep telling myself it cannot be this bad....I must gain another 2 or 3 levels and maybe it improves...I suppose that is the answer you would get from an addict.
I can only hope that over time the developers finally make it more fun to play. As right now I find it simply a grind and rage quit after and hour of so as I simply get frustrated by how dammed clunky everything is. 
I won't even begin about how just roaming around collecting resources you are suddenly out of nowhere assaulted by an enemy so many levels above your ability you are simply hit once and dead.

I however, kept an eye on it, because of course, i love love love open world titles and have spent thousands of hours in several others, including all of the previous fallouts. I got this on sale, for $30 plus some change, because i have offically ran out of open worlds to play in, at least in my mind.

17,Fallout 76,68839029,english,"Edit at +39 hours into the game: Since Steam denied me a refund 2x at 8 hours, I decided to suck it up and play more of the game. I think a lot of the bugs and stuff have been fixed, and I wish I could give this a ""meh"", because it's passable as a functional game now. But it's a shame that you can't really tell where to go or what quests to do at what level. Sometimes at level 35 now I'm killing level 3 feral ghouls, and then other times I run into level 60 Mr. Handy mobs that absolutely obliterate me, not to mention the level 62 feral ghouls that are hulked out that are even on the GOLF COURSE which is pretty much still a lowbie area.

As being starved for ammo and stuff, it's still the case if you're not making lead-farming runs like, once or twice every 24 hours IRL of gameplay or whatnot. Also as for caps, you just don't buy anything you want for caps since a lot of the good stuff costs a fortune. I'm sitting on 1500ish caps now and I just don't spend them unfortunately. No point, really. I'm *actually* saving up for a Lever-Action Rifle schematic which is like, 2.5k caps at a vendor :/

Weapon variety isn't great, it's basically Fallout 3 and 4 weapons yet again with some additional stuff thrown in (that I may not even have found in 4, so they could be old weapons as well). 

Either way, it's a skinner box simulator to the max and it's a nice time-waster. 5/10. 

Edit of review: The game shafts the entire storyline at like, level 5 by telling you to get to level 20 before you can move on with the storyline. Really. REALLY? I knew I should have refunded this.

I'd recommend this game as a non-serious time waster and nothing else. The amount of times I've shot something and had no damage register is astounding, but I end up getting by anyway.

This game has come a long way since launch and if Bethesda continues to improve it I can see it lasting a while and keeping us Fallout fans entertained until the next mainline game releases in the franchise.

I do want to say that I don't approve of some of the money making schemes that the company is pulling, but, I also know that if the game doesn't make a profit that they will shut it down and move all the current manpower to other projects instead. I still don't play the game enough to justify paying the fee for Fallout 1st and don't see myself getting all the things from the new season pass stuff but I am not going to let that stop me from enjoying the title.",1589782703,1589782703,TRUE,0,0,0.496811926,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,99,19,16029,2106,792,1602048250

32,Fallout 76,69347039,english,"So I started out only playing because it was free, then I got sucked in hard. FO76 has some faults but they have more updates coming.  They have done a good job of creating an MMO for PVE players, this system where if you are attacked and ignore the player they can not hurt you is great IF you are not fond of PVP. 

AI so far has been a good challenge too, having played the last 3 FO and beat the earlier 2 I am finding this AI a great improvement in challenge. Bases are better over the FO 4 system. Being able to keep one base and one inventory is great. Simply move the CAMP to where you want and pop out the base that was at the last location. In addition other players can not get into your storage though if access is there they can get into your craft benches but so what does not attach to your stuff. Also if they have an inventory box where you have access then you can get into your own through their box!! Guarantee that no one can steal from you!!

There is a built in guide in game to walk new to FO players through the start. If you have played FO 4 then you will pick this up instantly. VAT has changed though, no longer is time frozen but that is not a thing for MP anyhow so understandable. However it still works just seems to only target on enity at a time. Still very efficent way to fight. 

I seen when this hit Steam people call this P2W and devs being greedy. There is nothing you can buy with real cash that you can not easily earn in game. The shop is there simply for those that want insta brag rights. Most of what is in the shop is not crucial to the game anyhow that I could see. 

Another thing they did was you can set up a shop to sell your stuff to others!! So you enjoy just looting everything? Great!! Do that and just set up a shop at your base and bring in the profits. 

When it comes down to it FO76 is trying hard to be something FO was never thought to ever get to be. Does not do it the same as other MMO like Call Of Duty, but for me PVP is not important I enjoy the PVE part of the game. Plus meeting new people is easy as is trading on the spot with them.

I was initially put off by the online nature of the game and waited for the free trial to test it.
I was very pleasantly surprised.

Fallout 76 corrects all the flaws of Fallout 4 while possessing its own identity:
-a huge open-world with a lot of fascinating locations and almost no filler
-a survival lite aspect that works very well in the context of the game 
-very good quests with high quality writing and interesting ideas 
- good encounter design with less monsters and more exploration 
- a social and online element that you can safely ignore if you want to play solo but that is also well done if you want to play with friends and strangers

Generally speaking the sparser human characters and the focus on exploration make you truly feel like you are exploring a post-apocalyptic world and trying to survive.

They must think that it is cool to hop on the bandwagon of ""This games terrible"" without giving it a chance and only watching a couple YouTube videos, and honestly, its very aggravating to see.

This game has been AMAZING to play through so far and I have SO MUCH MORE TO DO still. Yes, the game has bugs. Yes, people complain about the launch of the game, but the game has changed so much. Having the ability to play through the original questline AND the Wastelanders questline gives this game even more content. There is so much lore, so many cool holotapes to listen to, so many cool secrets to discover, it is incredible.

Also, Bethesda just released a road map for the next year that looks incredible, they plan on fully supporting the game, and all of the things they are adding in are absolutely free. I look at something like this and it reminds me of the situation No Man's Sky was in a long time ago. They made a game, it didn't do too hot, they worked and worked and worked and improved it for free, and now the game is full price again and people love it.

This game has a lot of potential in my mind but at the state that it is right now i could not recommend buying it. 

It has terrible performance issues and frame drops playing on high settings on a 2080 super, for a product that is basically a re-hash of fallout 4, a game that at the time i'm writing this came out 5 years ago.

The  whole ""survival"" system is completly pointless and more than anything is annoying, the stash limit HAS to be expanded, AGAIN, 800 weight is way too little of a stash capacity if you consider that you have to put everything there. 

Then we have to talk about Fallout first.
It has to be reworked or repriced because the only pro i can see in getting it now is unlimited junk capacity and that's blatant p2w standards in a game that i already have payed for, keep in mind that it costs 120 euros for a yearly subscription where i live, which is completly unacceptable. 

While wastelanders helped a bit with the story but would recommend to stay away from it if you like your lore, most things in this game don't make any sense and are completly forgettable, but your mileage may vary

Is it a good game in general? eh, still lots of odd bethsda stuff but not much more than normal, one thing I will say is that it optimised terribly, I can easily get 144fps on 4 but can struggle to get over 40fps on 76, if thats the kind of thing that bothers you be aware, but I'm ok with it, it does look a bit better than 4, the lighting is much improved that makes the whole game look better but other than that basically looks the same as 4.

As for the game itself... I started playing because of the free weekend, I figured I'd get my kicks and quit... I have to give Bethesda credit, after all the bullshit surrounding this game, and the countless errors and failures and basic disregard for their loyal customers, Fallout 76 is actually fairly good. (Now)

In the current version of the game, for 40 dollars (or less for a sale) this game is most certainly worth it now. 

Big open world with lots to explore and lots to do all over, plus the random events to spice things up, quite a few quests scattered around (as well as a very nice system to sort them) Tons of weapons and customization (hoping they add even more as the game goes on.) Having random players around, I can take it or leave it, most people can and will, the lack of text communication is a large oversight, your only way to communicate being voice chat or emotes.

Random players however... can outright murder you, they only do around 5% of their normal damage or so per hit (unless you attack them back or vice versa) meaning its harder for them to pull it off, unless they're using a fatman, in which you will die regardless. The atom shop is annoying, given the repeated promises that it will be purely cosmetic, it is not, you can purchase a few different little boosts there, not necessary, but very useful things.

90,Fallout 76,69304566,english,"Purchased and played only after the wastelanders update, so i have no info of what this game was before. I signed up for the fallout 1st for the additional rewards and was not disappointed. 

Pros:
-The game plays just like fallout in many ways
-World is huge with more side quests than you can handle
-Community events are fun when you work together
-Havent experienced much griefing. It appears to have no incentivization to commit it.
-Tons of base customization - I spent hours on this lol
-Tons of guns and perk traits to mess with to create your preferred spec/playstyle

Cons:
-The game is still RIDDLED with bugs....some even game breaking. Ex: you press the interact key to use a terminal and you get stuck in the animation to it but it WILL not let you press anything to cancel. You may have to Alt F4 a few times because the game will get you stuck in the environment also.
-Mob popup. This is  really stupid as the game will decide to attack your camp or resource base and literally just spawn mobs in the middle of your house, bypassing all your exterior defenses. You will also find that the game arbitrarily sends high level legendary creatures to melt your base where even max level turrets get wrekt. This can't be intended...the enemy teleport is annoying enough. (Think ghouls that materialize out of your concrete foundation. like ten. 
-Unless you perk into it, throwing grenades is as risky to you as it is to whatever you want to die. The arc does not appear and you have to eyeball the toss. Often times this will lead to u tossing a grenade that reflects back into your face from a piece of environment that is blocking a throw from cover. This will happen alot....expect to die often from it. Ive also noticed the physics of throwing frags where they behave like rubber bounce balls and their first bounce sends them to the moon. Also, wild animals are aware of what grenades are and apparently evade them better than human enemies. This is quite annoying when mirelurks cluster and are like OH CRAP, HOLY HAND GRENADE. Weird.

Overall: The game is still fun. I play with a friend which makes the west virginia trip more fun and entertaining. ALthough you can play with randos, having a buddy or two definitely improves the experience. Playing on a private server is nice if you like having guaranteed resource bases open to you for farming. All in all, i think you will like this game if you dont go into it expecting a perfect fallout 5. Its still really fun 90% of the time.

Quick Update
BETHESDA TRIES TO TAKE OUT RENEWAL FEES A DAY EARLY CAUSING A LOCK OUT FOR 24 HOURS!
Wait for a sale
So many bugs
so so so so so many bugs
There really should be an achievement for finding so many
Literally new ones every time I play
Got the Classic stuck in the wall bugs to the npcs can shoot through anything
There are some strange ones as well like npcs you need to follow for a timed quest that decide now is a good time to show you what slo-mo actually means
The occasional infinite load screen or getting booted off private server
Invincible baddies-Love this bug when I'm low in ammo
Another fave is my turrets turning on my c.a.m.p. . Must not like the Reno's
How about clearing a hard fought area like Graftons steel mill(very little actual steel lol)and when cleaning up the goodies, all the baddies come back. That sucks
Ten minutes to fight a legendary only to have my reward loot disappear!
Playing 1st yet someone removed all my caps from my person
Ally likes to attack my base now too
Love being in a heated firefight when the zoom doesn't release
Not as much CTDS as i'd expect. Have about 30-40 actual in game hours and has only crashed 3-4 times and only an infinite loading screen once
How to you paint such a beautiful picture with such cheap paints?
Don't get me wrong, This isn't a terrible game its just not acceptable to me. Bethesda isn't new

So here are my main gripes instead:
- Boring, empty world with nothing to interact with 
- Every quest is a fetch quest that has you travelling all the fuck over with no real goal
- Durability is back but this time it isn't as easy as repairing with similar items. No no! You have to pay actual irl money to repair your weapons and armor! And LEGENDARY ITEMS BREAK TOO! 
-Enemy levels jump around so you'll be fighting either enemies that are way too overleveled or enemies that are way too underleveled with no inbetween
- Fast travel costs caps which are much more scarce than they are in other Fallout games and the world is so big and empty that you kinda need to fast travel to keep sane
- Player interaction is next to none if you don't have a mic

Sceptical at first, ended up really enjoying the journey ! Clearly not for all Fallout players though. Imagine playing Fallout 4 from the start, but after finishing all questlines and most sidequests. You'll end up playing a few quests here and there, reading terminals and lisneing to tape, and hoarding tons of resources. That's pretty much F76 gameplay.

The settlement system is a bit limited though; You can't place items that you found as decoration, except with display cases, and the building cap is pretty bad, there is no room for more than a very mild decoration. You can't place power armor as decoration either. You can place one single NPC (which means that the few lines the have get old really quick), but the rewards for their daily quests seem to be pretty good.

I started playing with the Wastelander update (that added, along other stuff, new NPC  & quests). According to the community, it did fix a lot of bugs, but... there is still a ton.

Enemies that are frozen at spawn and remain in the same position
Immortal enemies
A mustache popped on my character during the initial creation and could simply not be removed (I could even have 2 mustache of different styles at once, I had to restart the game to scrap the character)
The face of my character just became transparent (there was a haircut and two eyes floating) when I wanted to change the chin...
Taking damage out of nowhere
Being unable to jump to a long distance (i.e sprinting and then jumping on a high spot) will TP you back to where you jumped from, same sometimes happen when you try to travel a ""long"" distance with your power armor jetpack
Enemies registering the damage a bit late

It's multiplayer, so you'll encounter other players regularly. However, this is NOT rust, I've never been killed by another player, and high level players gave me survival stuff when I was starting up. Some nice guy was even waiting outside the initial starting area for new players/character, giving out stuff ! (Sorry mate, I thought you were an NPC at first, so I was taking my time speaking with the other NPCs at spawn... thanks though !)

The NPCs have dialogues that are VASTLY superior to Fallout 4 or Skyrim, with perks affecting options quite a lot. The only thing I regret is the lack of companions, although multiplayer is most certainly the cause of this. You're on your own in the world, unless you go to NPCs to see them.

The world building itself is great ! There are various regions with their own dangers, mobs, and landscape, stories left behind on tapes, documents and terminals about what was going on in the region before and after the bombs fell... The only thing I regret about this is that there is no NPC (that I have talked to) that mentioned how things were right after the bombs fell; since the game is set 25 years after, survivors of that time are extremely common.",1589565203,1589566450,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,279,35,8447,0,8443,1591739530

The addition of NPCs are great. And the dialogue options are much more better. Some of the options are pretty hilarious and it reminds me of FNV. Public events are fun with other players, but  there are times where mobs dont spawn or spawn enough, or a high level player just mows everything down, and players just stand there waiting for the event to give the reward.
But there are tons to do, lots of recipes to collect and craft, and a map bigger than Fallout 4 to explore. I'm looking forward to what they're gonna add next.

95,Fallout 76,68131178,english,"Unfortunately you can't go into a Fallout game not looking to be disappointed anymore. This is a good Fallout game if you're willing to forgive the flaws, which there are a lot of. Like past Fallout titles, this is a game where you will come across bugs which are often visual in nature and so not game breaking. But you will more than likely also come upon many that are game breaking, and require you to reset your game multiple times in order to get what's often a quest, to work.

This game is a constant battle of inventory management. Each player has their own stash, which can hold 800 lbs. much like the workshop inventory in Fo4 but with a weight limit. This stash fills up so quickly, It didn't take anytime at all to fill it with 300 lbs. of scrap. Then when combining the weight of scrap with weapons, armor, medicine and food, you will find your stash maxed out essentially all of the time throughout your playthrough. When it's maxed out you obviously can't store anything else, so you have to sort through the hundreds of items in order to cherry pick the essentials, and discard the rest, which was a process that I had to undergo practically everytime I returned to my camp. But thankfully! Bethesda thought of this! And that's why they offer their ""Fallout 1st"" premium members the ability to build a scrap box which has a seperate inventory for the 300 lbs. of scrap you will accumulate.

In summary, this is one of those games where it's difficult to either say if it's a good game or a bad game, because it's really just a mixbag of both.Overall the gameplay is pretty fun and the story is mostly solid too.

The writing is all-around better than 4 and the world seems big, without having too much empty space. There's always an event to jump into somewhere on the map and the addition of seeing other players' housing is something I never knew I wanted so much in Fallout.

And Nuclear Winter is...actually great. It's a really fun Battle Royale mode and it isn't as polished as something like Apex Legends, but at the same time you can't drop a nuke in that game so there's pros and cons.

Give it a chance when a free weekend rolls around. Like any MMO your first 5 hours are just a slice of the experience, and things like rewards and incentives naturally start to thin out once you're hooked.

This however i enjoy the mechanics, love exploring the scenes, the new places.
I suppose you will enjoy it more if you didn't recently play any other fallouts and treat this more as a survival game hybrid with fallout 4.

I have to say i love most things about it, so i will only say those things that bother me in ascending order:
- The lag: the way the enemies collapse a few miliseconds later is like the coyote getting outplayed by the roadrunner. ""oh wait im supposed to fall? - yeah you are"". It's not as bad as it was in the launch videos but can get a bit jarring.
- I don't like the real time vats. the only point is to use it with high damage rifles or to execute crits. For what i use it is to cheat to find enemies.
- world pvp, and the wanted system is just bad. and almost pointless
- Npcs as in actual people just add flavor so far with wastelanders not much else. Still nice to have them around, talk to them and forget about them.
- Even if you do significant damage to a boss but it pisses off for a while and someone else kills it you won't get loot ( i guess it's on a timer)
- Camp building is buggy since launch, certain structures make it so that you cant put your camp down when you move it, unless you are aware what causing the so called ""floating bug"", so you have to rebuild it again and again or make it really bare. or absurd looking
- Needs more songs on the radio
- the Ai is very dumb very often, or not work at all and just t-pose, especially at workshop defense they can get really annoying and you have to spend a long time looking for them if they don't show up on the map or get stuck in something. Or completly blind.
- The abosulte worst. Unlimited Scrapbox being a Fallout 1st thing, it seems like thats the whole selling point to a subscribtion based plan. I dare to say i would consider buying just the scapbox for a set price forever without a subscription fee. you never get me pay for that and from the few people i talked to in game they wont give in to that as well and it's see through but whatever floats your boat. However your stash capacity is small and requires constant micromanagement its double what it was at launch and that says a lot. This is my biggest issue let me store my cool guns and outfits please. 

I know a lot of these might put people off but these are not as bad except the stash. That's bad. Otherwise i enjoy it despite all this. Have fun!

Edit: after a few weeks and 100+ hours.
Glad to have found everything I said stands true. Finished all main quests and side quests besides one Ally and one that seems a little too much work, you'll know which if you get there :) totally in the realm of grinding now, waiting for the next update, which promises some more quests and a story that will span a few seasons. Bethesda seems fully committed to keep on this game, expecting the ESO treatment with the one wasteland update.
some may find the grind which stands for the endgame a little off-putting, in my experience, this is Child's play compared to the 600+ hours of warframe i went through. The rest of my library is mothballed because of this game and I don't see that changing any time soon.

Call me crazy, but I'm finding the absence of a story bothering me less as I go on, I'm the lead actor now, I see a low level player, do I tag along and help him with a few fights? drop some ammo or a low level gun as a gift? or just wave my hand and be on my way? this is my story and I play it as I want. A new guy being a jacka** shooting others and now have a bounty? be the vigilante and take him out then give him some supplies when he respawn to say no hard feelings? having no immediate quest markers freed me to just do what I want and I love it :)

First Impressions:
I've put some hours into FO76. Avoided it until after the Wastelanders dropped. I can only imagine how boring this game would've been without dialog NPCs. It seems mostly playable, though quirky. One bug caused me to lose a full set of Ultracite Power Armor; see canned response above.

I played the first 50-60 hours blind and did not read any external documentation and had no idea for strategy or idea what I was doing. This game becomes increasingly annoying as you progress, and I find myself not wanting to explore through same old boring fetch quests and have grown impatient with the grind to level 50. I'd definitely recommend looking up guides, interactive maps and out of game resources to balance out the annoying factor. A lot of the game is self explanatory, or makes sense with a little thought/experimentation. But large portions are not exactly intuitive. 

The interface/controls are... Bethesdian janky and feel hacked together or seem to be haphazardly bolted on. The black screen in power armor bug still persists, and is totally annoying and a huge waste of time especially after holding a workshop for only minutes. 

This game meets almost none of the hype and hardly covers the scope from its initial announcement. I don't care for the implementation of monthly subscriptions or micro transactions, which I feel detract greatly. You can still earn the micro transaction currency (Atoms) without paying money through completing in game challenges, but it's somewhat limited.

It's still kinda fun, but far from what I would expect to be a a polished AAA title in 2020. 

TL;DR:
I'm feeling a strong 4/10.

Graphics 6/10
Controls 6/10
Polish 3/10
Stability 3/10
Fun 6/10
Ol' Butcher Pete 10/10

1) are ok with minimum viable product quality despite 526+ days since launch
2) have extra money in your Steam wallet

1) expect a finished/polished game

23,Fallout 76,69120802,english,"Let's be honest, Bethesda game's problems are at this point a known quanity. Yes there are microtranactions and yes there is a subscription fee system that contains features which, when absent from your experience, make the QOL adequate. This is known, the freshman attempt of a company, never truly possessing the ability to ship games without an almost unrivaled amount of bugs, is plagued with Live Service rookie mistakes. The game is basically just churched up Fallout 4

So given all this why, because all RPGs demand grinding for the perfect gear and trying out new builds. Fallout 4 did not have the limited number of perks and therefore if you are fully leveled you are the one and only ever build that ever existed and you are walking around and twiddling your thumbs regretting that you didn't just keep the story stuck with the BoS sending endless vertbirds so you'd at least have something worth shooting, but instead your stuck gunning down raiders in shopping carts and shooting pellets of Mike Pence's charisma or those dumb green bullet sponge assholes who are only mildly more annoying. It you were a Predator instead of getting your green dick hard on hunting Apollo Creed and two separate strong men who became govenors... you're a Predator in a mosh pit for a christian straight edge band that doesn't curse in their albums. Sure you can kill a bunch of shit but what's the point?

So we circle back now to boil it down, do you want to grind builds in a Fallout game and have a reason to keep playing even if it means Bethesda being well themselves along the way? Or is the troubled execution too much to handle? None of us truly get rewarded from games the way everyone else does. If you want that experience and don't mind the warts. Definitely get this game. If you need a game that is managed well and polished without lapsing into predatory 2020 dick head game pricing bullshittery stay far away from this one.

This game is perfect for playing with friends. There is so much to do and the camp building system is addicting. I love the lore and all the little easter eggs they sprinkled throughout. Fallout 76 is full of quirkiness and humor. I don't always like the battle system because it feels a little clunky. The sensitivity seems a little weird on PC which I never noticed on the console version but it hasn't deterred me from playing or caused any problems past initial annoyance until I set it to my liking through my DPI and sensitivity settings. One of my favorite features in this game is that you can change your appearance whenever you want. That's a PLUS PLUS PLUS feature in my opinion. There is just so much to do in this game without it being overly complicated.

40,Fallout 76,69085214,english,"I bought this game on console at launch and if I had reviewed it after my time spent in the vanilla PS4 version, my review would have been negative. Thankfully, the PC version along with the Wastelanders update addresses most of what had me so disgruntled with the game at launch. On console, the game runs with a barely functional framerate, and textures are hard to see at even a minor distance, but thankfully with the power and optimization possible with PC gaming, this isn't an issue for the Steam version, provided your PC has the proper specs. The game still has its share of bugs, but they are more of a minor nuisance that I can get over.

The biggest and best change to the game, however, is the Wastelanders update. Finally, someone over at Bethesda felt it wise to actually put some Fallout back into their Fallout game. NPCs to interact with are finally a feature in the game, and they come along with the quests and dialogue options you would expect from the series. There are a few oddities, given the nature of the shared multiplayer world the characters are inhabiting, but so far I've found that the quests are enjoyable, and that the big, beautiful, diverse map that Fallout 76 always had finally feels alive and worth exploring. Skill checks also make a welcome return and gives the player plenty more to consider when deciding which special stats to boost upon a level up. Charisma and Intelligence in particular feel like much more useful skills to have than they did in the vanilla game.

Now, I don't just want to shower Fallout 76 with praise, as this game has had a rocky release, to put it mildly, and many problems still persist. Wastelanders even brings some new problems with it. For example, a team that enters an instanced quest area together are only progressing the quest for the ""team leader"" and the other players reap little to no rewards for helping their comrades. Since Fallout 76 is all about teaming up with your friends, this makes the Wastelanders quest feel oddly like a single player only experience wedged in between a wider multiplayer game. Its a problem that needs to be addressed for future updates. As I mentioned earlier, plenty of bugs also persist and cause the occasional need for a reload in order to get quests to function properly. The Atomic Shop has also been a subject of debate, and those unhappy with the prices offered there are unlikely to change their minds. Atoms are relatively easy to accumulate in game, and I'm not someone who ever really makes in game purchases, so I haven't found my experience to be hindered much, but if you do not have the patience to save up Atoms in game then there is no doubt you will be frustrated with the value offers on some of the skins, apparel and other cosmetic items in the shop. For my money, I will admit I probably prefer it the way it is to the mandatory monthly subscriptions of old, or even to paid DLC. I'ts actually kind of nice knowing there are some obsessive players out there essentially funding my DLC, while I just grab the occasional item for no extra expense with the Atoms I've saved from in game challenges.

At the end of the day, Fallout 76 with the Wastelanders expansion is a pretty good foundation for that type of online Fallout experience that I want to see. It still could use plenty of work and updates, but it sounds like those will be continuing for the forseeable future. For me, in its current form, Fallout 76 has been elevated to a 6 or 7/10, and it is well worth playing if you enjoy Bethesda's style of open worlds. I look forward to continued movement in the right direction in future updates.",1589403776,1589403776,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,175,9,3876,0,3589,1589582908

If i had to put words to it I would say this game is pretty much ruined by Bethesdas gatekeeping of the quality, production, and stability. This is not a game for everyone, it's a game designed in arrogance of its own hype drawing in people who ignore its flaws.

I mean they spend more effort into making sure freeloaders don't stay in a private server after the host is gone then they do fixing the bugs IN the private servers. Not to mention they have to control which servers you go to and they clearly aren't meant to handle large groups of players. 

You will encounter gaming-breaking bugs over and over, annnnd over. Public or Private. And because modding, which has been their biggest support community allll these years, is taboo now you are at their mercy. And their involvement seems to be reseting your server randomly

43,Fallout 76,69083701,english,"After playing a 100+ hours on PS4 and now slowly moving to PC this like many other reviews is a complicated one.   I have been a long time fan of the series since it first released and have played version on some console / pc since then.  So for me this game has been a super fun experience for me enough to buy it on PC and keep on playing. Its been my game for COVID-19, so I will give you the good and bad  and you can make your judgement based on what my experience has been thus far.  

BAD (and sometimes downright ungly) 

- The launch was a complete disaster, so much that it made me delete the game off my PS4 never to return until now.  It was buggy, bad, and simply not fun.  The world with out NCP's felt unfinished and uninteresting.  Bethesda deserves every negative review going forward because of the mega belly flop they preformed with a an awesome story line .  Sometimes you gamble big and lose big 

-Post launch bugs are still in this game, you will hate them and learn to live with them.  Hot fixes are coming out so they are at least trying to listen.  

-Even though I own it - fallout 1st has some huge quality of life items ( portable tent and scrap box) that really give you a huge advantage in the game.  My hope is that they offer some sort of olive branch to new players  or ones who simply dont want to pay a monthly free for this feature.  But for now it is what it is so its up to you to make that choice.  

-The Atom Store has mostly cosmetic times that you can earn through game time but some of these skins should be put in as items you can get through game play. 

-End game grind / game play needs some big improvements -  Scourchbeast Queen and Wendigo Collosus really need buffs because they are loot pinattas that just get nuked - Gold Bullion and Caps have hard caps so its hard to amass any wealth. -  Looking forward to seeing what they improve on this. 

The Good 

- A massive map, that has a lot to explore.  Areas are well designed and really cool,  simply put its fun to walk around and once you encounter, deathclaws, mothmen and other NPC's it becomes even cooler 

-The perk system even with its major flaws leads to some interesting builds and its simple to grasp. 

-Game play is simple- it takes you less than five minuets to learn what you need to know and get right into it. For me its just a fun relaxing game.  

-Wastelanders brought life to what was a dead game - its by no means perfect but its a different experience now and is now the product that should have been offered on launch. - The story is fun, and gives you purpose to get to level 50 and with all of the other NPC's that surround you it enhances the good parts of 76.   

-This game is what you make of it, if you have hesitations then stay away from it.  If you are a LONG time fallout fan like me you will learn to really enjoy this game despite its flaws but it is not for everyone. I am more than forgiving than other players and its easy to understand why people still have sour grapes. The launch will still be the worst gaming experience I have every had.   If you are on the fence just watch and read every review - give it some time before you pull the trigger.

The public events usually have 3-5 other players to play alongside with so the game doesn't feel that empty. I didn't think I would enjoy just sneaking around a town looting up a bunch of junk to scrap but I find it oddly satisfying. I never did much with the settlement building in FO4 since I didn't see much of a point to it. Again, I didn't plan on doing much with my CAMP in FO76 but I found myself enjoying building my mountainside cabin. The CAMP becomes the center of your world in the game and I think it's definitely worth putting time into to make the game more enjoyable.

After level 50 you'll have to be creative and make personal goals to set to keep the game fun. It won't be for every one.

Please Note that everyone has there own opinions when it comes to games, These are mine.

[h1] Bigger stash size [/h1]

I am a hoarder in the entire fallout series, I have collected stuff from pip boys from fallout 3 to nuka colas on new vegas and fallout 4.

But when it came to the storage system in fallout 76 i sighed, Because it was so limited. It's not right that fallout 76 premium membership offer unlimited storage in my opinion.

[h1] Pause in pipboy menu [/h1]

When it comes to the pipboy in all of fallout games...Well...when you are about to die from a super mutant you need those stimpaks and  a weapon...In fallout 76 however it's kinda..well not there, I don't know how the feature could work in a multiplayer world. But it would be nice to have it back in the game like the other fallout games had.

I could list a huge amount of improvements that would have been nice to see, But i will leave it here

My personal rating for this game is

[h1] 8/10 [/h1]

77,Fallout 76,69038447,english,"Wanted to give the game a fair shake and at this point I think I have.  Even with NPC's this game is so utterly devoid of content it's a lifeless corpse.  Kind of like how Bethesda is defiling the Fallout IP which has been dead since F4.

Pros:
- What little story there is is fine.  Not good (NV), not bad (F4), just fine.  You get enough feeling for what happened after the bombs fell and the story is passibly bland.
- The community is probably the most surprising element of the game.  The community of the game is spectacular and it's about the only thing I got wrong in my prediction for Fallout 76.
- Perks are better balanced than they are in Fallout 4.  That's kind of like winning the Special Olympics, but it is fair to note that they changed the SPECIAL system and managed to improve it.
- Freemium ATOMS dropped pretty easily in my playthrough and there really wasn't a point that I wanted something I couldn't afford.

Cons:  
- Not a lot to do after level 50 except farm gold, scrip and reputation.  Reputation really isn't really worth finishing and scrip just generates garbage legendaries that you can convert back into scrip so that you can roll more garbage legendaries again.  Daily caps on scrip and gold (understandable) make the grind unreasonable and adds to the tedium of it all.
- A lot of the same bugs you remember from Fallout 3 are STILL here.  Yes, that's right.  Fallout 3. From 2008.  They say in Fallout ""War never changes"", but they should change that to ""shoddy development never changes"".  Enemies still clip through the terrain when killed with energy weapons, legendary corpses disappear at random, sneak randomly stops working (which is great when your build depends on it) and all kinds of fun issues you remember from playing any other Fallout game up to this point still remain. 
- NPC's that you team up with for missions are little more than bullet sponges.  Few are interesting and even fewer are useful.
- Combat system is all over the place.  I can take down a 20 level higher than me legendary at half life one minute and the next minute I'm fully healed and get inexplicably owned by a basic mob almost twenty levels lower than me.  Hit boxes could use some work as I've swung through mobs before.  
- I hated settlement building in Fallout 4, and thought Fallout 76 would be the game where all the work they did on this would payoff.  This was the game where settlement building made sense, and I figured there was going to be some sort of factional thing where users could build settlements or claim preexisting ones for factions.  I was sorely mistaken and I apparently had too high of expectations for this game.  You can't actually build a settlement; only your own place in the middle of the lifeless Appalachia wasteland and then visit other people's places on the other side of the lifeless wasteland.  
- They're liars.  Private servers were supposed to be a thing at launch (they were not).  The ATOM shop was only supposed to be cosmetic (it is not).

84,Fallout 76,69024211,english,"Fallout 76 Wastelanders is an expansion to the original Fallout 76 game that features NPCs and a new story campaign. The original campaign does not feature any human NPCs, but rather mostly robot characters and audio recordings. The story reason is that all the NPCs left because of a virus going on and curing and stopping the virus is the ultimate goal of the campaign, but it still feels strange that there are absolutely no humans anywhere then all of the sudden for Wastelanders several humans just “show up.” Aside from that the story itself is a mess. It’s all over the place and it doesn’t feel like a story but rather a to-do list of tasks to complete with the overall goal of “stopping the virus”. While the main story isn’t great, the side quests and events have a lot to offer in story and content, and the world itself is full of story and content to explore. It feels like more effort when into the world than the story itself.
I was very hesitant to buy this game because it’s an MMO. I was expecting to get killed a lot by higher level players of have my base destroyed several times, however the player community has been very supportive, and I haven’t run into any issues. You don’t see players in the world all that often unless you’re doing events of quests and when you are everyone is working together for the same goal. You can’t really get damaged by other players unless you both attack each other and engage in PVP, and even if you die you won’t lose anything of value like money or weapons. 
Even though this game has had major bug fixes since it first released it still has several bugs, however not many are game breaking. Many players including myself have reported that hits don’t always register with enemies and even you drain their health bar it still takes a while for them to die properly. There are also some bugs with the player owned shops accidently selling items that aren’t for sale, however there haven’t been too many bugs that overall impacted my enjoyment of the game.
Overall, I’d say if you were interested in the game but nervous to try it because of all the news and rumors surrounding it when it first released to give it a try. Many of the problems have been addressed and the multiplayer does not affect the game too much, it does take some getting use too, but still feels like a Fallout game.

89,Fallout 76,68279437,english,"UPDATE: Right, so ive played most of the content already and I feel like i should be able to give a good insight/review regarding the game.

Before that lemme just explain my point of view. I'm a new player, i bought the game when the WASTELANDERS update went up. When I first play the game i played the Vanilla Fallout 76 first THEN i play the WASTELANDERS contents, I do this cause im curious of how Fallout 76 vanilla experience hold up.... and i want to get those special dialogues check when playing WASTELANDER.

In my time playing this game I've mostly enjoy my experience honestly i even enjoy the vanilla content/story. Though it can be a bit boring sometimes, but its not because the story itself is dull but the way they told the story through Terminals, Notes, and Holotapes can become pretty dull. I mean, in side quest or just telling story outside quest, something with a more smaller scope, this sort of lore building is interesting, but when its tight into the main quest where its long and take you all around the map it just become repetitive, luckily WASTELANDER added NPC to some of the main story key location so the experience is a bit better, they also added dialogues trees to the Vanilla NPC, now i don't know if this dialogue tree already existed pre-Wastelander or not but it definitely make the experience way better. But ofc you're probably more interested on WASTELANDER story, and its good. The Raiders especially have many interesting characters that just clicked to me, despite my resentment towards their faction as a whole. Honestly Im surprised on how taken i was with these characters and how I wish the main story was a bit longer, but what's there is good.

Now as for gameplay the easiest way to tell if you will enjoy this is whether or not you enjoy Fallout 4 gameplay, and by that i don't mean just the combat I mean the game loop as a whole which are Explore->Fight->Craft/Preparation and repeat, because its the main core of the game, and I tell you, I enjoy the game loop in Fallout 76 more than in Fallout 4. Exploration is more fun because of how diverse the Flora and Fauna is. Seriously, have you seen the new creatures in this game? They're so weird and unique, i love it! The combat is pretty much the same, but the perk system is surprisingly pretty depth and I love to min-max my build. As for Crafting stuff, it really got you motivated to look around and find materials. Building is also more fun to me here, maybe its because you got to show off to random people online so it get you motivated to make your base looks as cool as possible.

Now with all that said, its pretty clear I enjoy the game, so does that mean Fallout 76 WASTELANDERS is perfect and its the true online Fallout experience now....? 

No. Here's why.

First off, the game still have bugs I was lucky enough to not have any game breaking bugs but it still there, lurking, waiting to pop out.
Next its the game End Game. I have mixed feeling about the end game. On one hand I understand the need for a very, VERY GRINDY end game as pre wastelanders the game does not really have an end game (so ive been told). BUT I DO NOT LIKE HOW THEY FORCE US TO LOGIN DAILY, forcing your player to login daily just make it feels like a CHORE it aint fun! Why can't it be weekly like any other MMO!? Oh i know, its because they want player to login daily so that they can *SLAPPED* their d@mn micronstransactions at your face in hoping maybe this is the day you finally give in and purchased something!

SPEAKING OF MICROTRANSACTIONS
You know Fallout 1st? Yeah that very controversial subscriber service? If you're like me, at one point of the game you will want, no, NEED that services because of the scrap box benefit! Now, i must gave them credit though, the deal is not as bad as people make it to be, you got a lot of atomic credits and other benefit that kinda justify its price and you can just buy once for 1 month and never again...but its still bull. Other than that the microtransaction has been mostly skins and furniture, least from what i seen so far. Oh there's repair kit and stuff, but honestly you can get that easily in game and I only used it 3 times in my 150 hours playtime.

So how do we conclude this? In the end i do recommend it, however.....

Bethesda said that WASTELANDERS is the foundation on how they will continue to added to the game and as far as foundation is feels pretty solid. But here's the thing.

The game is 2 years old now, it took them TWO years and TWO major updates to FINALLY create a foundation players will enjoy! Now im glad they stick to their guns and didn't abandon the game game, but it should give you a perspective on wtf is wrong with the development of this game. HOPEFULLY they finally understand their player and the direction they should be going better now and future content would be as good if not better than WASTELANDERS. Because if its not, im definitely changing my opinion with toward this game.

But, what they have right now is pretty solid, so for now, thumbs up.",1588221774,1589301143,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,96,17,11861,0,4647,1596286980

Pros:
- huge map to explore
- alot of funny mad robots with good voice acting
- somewhat beautiful environment and music

Cons:
- you are playing a *Fallout* game, but you cannot kill any NPC, you can only say ""yes"" and ""maybe later"" to side quest and only ""yes"" to main quest NPC. Other dialogue options and SPECIAL checks dont have any meaning. Then run around with floating quest markers and go through the motions... Hello WoWout. You want your choices to mean something or any choice at all? Play Fallout2, New Vegas or even F4.
- Daily quests with token rewards for random epic loot.. wait where did i see that?
- artificial shortage of storage space and crafting materials to make you donate and its not free-to-play.
- you are playing mostly ""single player"", but on online server, which means constant lags, rubber-bands, delays when you activate workbenches or terminals. Missing when mobs are right at your crosshair. The loot appearing in a container after you stare at it for a second. You log in and check map to see where you need to go? Check back in a minute when quest info is loaded.
- still performance problerms and bugs
- other ppl houses and shops don't help with immersion, they can just disappear from under you if a player logs off when you are about to hit buy button.
- some wierd crap with player communications: you cant chat but any random schoolboy can yell sh*t at you if he is nearby and has mic, while you search for block/mute button.
- Deathclaws (or any melee mob) still can't get to you if you just jump on a platform half their height. 
- some random events that happen every other minute on the map or triggered by players cause center-screen animations every time, which is annoying as hell.

You can enjoy this game for just exploring, looting, crafting and chilling in post-apocalyptic atmosphere. Expect anything more - you will get disappointed.

3,Fallout 76,68988564,english,"I was dead set against this games development and release. I kept myself informed, I read many articles, some good, many bad. I believed, and still believe, that some IPs simply don't need or benefit from an online, multiplayer version. I was very standoffish, initially, when Bethesda released Elder Scrolls Online. I eventually tried it, and in some small ways fell in love with it. I was a convert. I'll always be somewhat conflicted about multiplayer games being developed from IPs with a long history of excellent single player games. Some IPs simply don't translate well into an MMO environment. 

That said, like ESO, I gave it a shot, post the newest Wastelanders update that frankly did a 180 on Fallout 76. I jumped in, and now I'm a convert. It's great.

9,Fallout 76,68981823,english,"if, ""mixed"" was an option in a review, I would use it.  My time with this game has been conflicted, don't let my hours on PC confuse you, I played much more on xbox.  getting right into it, i'm going to look at what it did well; this game is a great ""mindless"" game, one where you go from task to task, thing to thing to get rewards to pimp out your cool guns or work for buying new ones.  On paper, I would have thought this game wouldn't be fun, but its just engaging enough to keep you from constantly thinking about the grind in a negative light.  This game can look picturesque at times, and horribly glaring in others.  This game at some points will have sweeping vistas of god-rays, fog, and the colorful trees at some points, then have all the shadows move in a choppy noticeable way for sunsets.  

Gameplay:  Its like fallout 4, but with one extra thing that makes it a bit better; enemy variety.  Fallout 4s downfall was its endgame, you had your crazy max mod gun with as much ammo as you would ever need, killing everything with just a handful of guns.  Now with weapon durability and a reduced amount of walking ammo boxes, (Fo4 Raiders, them fucks were everywhere) you sometimes have to choose between sinking resources into crafting ammo for that epic one gun, or making a new one that takes that ammo type.  This change isn't much, but it helps in making the game feel fresh at times.   Enemy variety is great in this game, each region has certain enemies that can be found in those areas, and some enemies that can be found just about everywhere. 

the true endgame boss of this game is your own stash limit/rare components, this game gives you 800 pounds to work with for storage.  Now, this is a problem when the game clearly tries to give you the message of, ""try new guns! have variety!"" when you cant even put what you are carrying in the little box.   Containers in your camp are linked directly to your stash, so don't try to organize your weapons, armor, grenades, ammo in different boxes if that's your thing.  Now, some common responses to this is either, ""don't be a hoarder, idiot"" or, ""just bulk and sell it, lol"" and I certainly agree with that first point, I should not click E on everything, I get it.  Getting on to that second point, however, I have some problems with it; most vendors share a cap pool that resets every 20 hours.  ""This doesn't sound like a problem, sell the crap you don't want and buy new crap you want, its an endless cycle of getting more of what you want while hoarding!"" Flat out doesn't work, whenever you buy an item from a vendor that costs, say 1000 caps, they get only 100-300 caps added to their pool.  ""so what, they still get caps right?"" yeah, but you slowly run out, its not sustainable.  This design choice seems really backwards to me because it feels like todd howard himself hits you over the head with a sign that says ""No, don't keep playing"" which is counterintuitive to the core design of an mmo like this.  
(note in case anyone from bethesda or someone sees this,  All problems with stash limits and inventory problems would be solved by letting vendors keep 100% of caps they get, players don't quit after reaching their daily limit, and continue to grind for rare plans and mods that they need without feeling like they are not allowed to play the game for the next 20 hours because their stash is full.  I cant count the times i've had to put the game down by force because I don't want to run around with 1k worth of resources I want to sell on my person)

Seriously, please fix the stash; if you are not going to give non-subscription players the INFINITE STORAGE SCRAPBOX THAT LETS YOU HOARD AND HAVE NO SCRAP/INVENTORY PROBLEMS... then please let vendors keep caps so I don't feel compelled to quit the game due to losing interest in playing an inventory management sim disguised as an MMO FPS game.",1589240776,1589240807,FALSE,2,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,20,1,7092,0,5074,1600485330

So that's a minor gripe.  The world is huge and totally explorable for the most part.  The game gets repetative very quickly and once the main quests were over I lost interest in doing the typical catch and retrieve and go and kill quests that continue forever (though I did a lot of those while leveling my character).

22,Fallout 76,68961419,english,"There's been a lot of controversy behind this game, for good reason. It's just Fallout 4 again with a new location, multiplayer, some new weapons and creatures, but otherwise everything that has been implemented has been lackluster and stacked on a rickety foundation. It is bad.

This is the most unstable of all Fallout games, rivaling Fallout 3's PC port, I've had an insane amount of crashes. Enemy animations often break, making it possible to completely lose your loot or get hit by ""ghosts"" that you cannot see, sometimes corpses and goo/ash piles fall out of the world as well making legendary kills pointless at times. Buttons and other activation switches can get stuck and prevent you from progressing, requiring you to switch worlds. Despite your PC the game is poorly optimized and you can experience lockups in rather strange ways, sometimes loading screens take longer than normal and you can still be attacked while loading.

Unappealing gameplay features; When you make a character, you have stat points to assign as you level, you have a limit and you can't change your points until you reach 50, then each level you have the choice of switching a perk point or getting a new perk card, before 50 you would earn both, there is no full respec and it's better to start playing with a build in mind. 

Despite being allowed to build a camp ""anywhere"" the building is almost a step down from Fallout 4's due to how picky it can be, often lighting up green but still complaining it is intersecting with some object you cannot see or is considered floating even if you may use the same set up somewhere else. 

Fast traveling costs caps, which you don't make as easily, this adds up as you reach the late game and need to travel longer distances, making you pay anywhere between 30-60 caps where your quests will net you about 30-90, depending.

You don't just need stat points to build now, you need to get lucky to earn plans from various events or quests, or buy them from Vendors (Not recommended, their prices are insane. If you want a jetpack for your power armor they can get up to 7500 caps.) On top of needing this luck, even when you learn your plans, it's not learned account wide and is only for that character, if you want it for a different character there's no method of sharing aside from getting your friends to do hold onto it for you. 

This whole game is a scam and it has the audacity to also offer a $13 a month subscription, while the things offered are tempting, that's part of the problem. The subscription gives you the in-game-paid-for currency in bunches per month, allowing people who like to customize to have many options or people focused on the gameplay the means to purchase kits that repair your equipment without costing you resources. In addition, it's the ONLY WAY TO HAVE A PRIVATE WORLD, it's also the only way to increase the size of your limited stash, because food, ammo, and materials all have weight and are not affected by your perks, eventually you won't be able to cram it all in there and you'll find yourself min-maxing everything to the point it's just a chore.",1589210833,1589210833,FALSE,11,1,0.567784488,9,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,241,28,19126,1335,10257,1601891452

44,Fallout 76,68758356,english,"I'm not so much into Fallout series kind of went with it to surprise a friend who really endores the series so going into this game as a complete stranger and learning bits of the game history and events that took place.
let's see if I can summery my expiernce thus far. 

The game offers versatile builds but it comes with limitations, if you went 15 strenght, but find a weapon thats suddenly full perception / agility you going to spend atleast 30 levels re-allocating points and pick the correct perks for said weapon. Or just make second character and give it the correct build.

Well asfar my understanding goes in Fallout series it's all about hoarding Junk and convert it into weapons, armors, material to construct a place to call home. Sadly this is where the game flips the finger at their players, must say Im glad I tried the game after 2 years since release couldn't imagine the pain people had to go through with 200 inventory stash...

So what really feels like a kick in the balls here if you are a hoarder leave no corner unlooked and take it all you will hit that 800KG storage limit so rediclously fast you have to become scavanger efficient so you must learn what material do you really need in big numbers and which material can you save on. Plastic will be you biggest friend as you will be forced to bulk up item per 15x or 30x Stacks as vendors will only buy it then from you if you dont want to deal with this junk capacity storing problem Bethesda got your ass covered pay €15 for a month to gain unlimited Junk storage and hoarder like an absolute maniac.

Once your Fallout paid service ends everything you ever stored in the scrapper box stays there and can be used however you can no longer use that infinite storage untill you pay again so how much hoarding and inventory space management are you willing to go for?

Lastly the Public server can be so laggy it's unplayable I've been in so many situations where it's so rough things stop working properly, by which I mean the lag is so severe you can't use a stimpack because your input won't be registered you try to meelee a ghoul goodluck half the time your input won't register and after mashing and you do swing your weapon the hit shows damage done but within 2 seconds you see that HP bar go back up as it never been hit but in the meanwhile it'll molest you.

This game might be worth it once:
- They make their servers more robust so it can perform much better
- Make vendors hold more Caps or reset at better times then every 24H since you last used them
- have atleast 250+ Legendary tokens to obtain on a daily base from the legendary trading machine as 150 just way too low

Some funny things
- Physics can be fun as things explode into bits or just litarally fly off ragdolling
- put on general subtitles if you just wanna giggle at Scorched emotes
- Watch out for Radiated bears because once their within melee range they'll tear you to shreds!",1588890872,1589162573,FALSE,3,0,0.480042011,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,47,7,47217,4146,13111,1602024741

54,Fallout 76,68925971,english,"Since the Wastelanders update, this has been the online/co-op Fallout experience we were wanting. The main reason why I didn't bother with it before was lack of NPC's, the world just looked dead, desolate, and boring. Now, it's much more like a Fallout world with the strange characters, old timey radio broadcasts, etc...

While the game's much better now, it still has issues. In order to run at good frame rates, you cannot run the game on ultra settings, the engine just won't let you without robbing every frame when you enter a town. I'm running on high textures, medium everything else, low shadow draw distance and that seems to be a good balance of quality and performance. You NEED to limit your frames to 144 or you'll run into this bug in indoor instances where you get stuck every time you stop. Aside from those two things, I haven't run into any other game breaking issues so far. Occasionally, I get this bug where my weapon fires randomly. Also, aiming down sights can be clunky with pump/bolt action weapons.

I've come across really helpful players, even some nice enough to leave little starter kits in front of one of the early hub areas complete with food and water to keep you well sustained in the wasteland.

The game very much feels like Fallout, with the combat mechanics (excluding VATS), crafting, and base building. Leveling up is different, but I like the card system. Some may prefer a plain stats page like New Vegas, but of course that'll come down to the individual. The ATOM shop is not a pay to win thing like I thought it would be. Everything on there is cosmetic except for repair kits, and scrap kits, which aren't necessary to have since you can scrap/repair at work benches.

All in all, the game's really fun so far, especially with friends of course. Even solo, the game feels like a regular Fallout game now.

76,Fallout 76,68874474,english,"The game is finally fun to play, but has some issues that Bethesda should look into:

NPCs
- NPC's are back, the map is full of them (human NPC's, raiders, settlers, and more). But  they need some improvement in both AI and facial expressions. Still, it makes the game look and feel VERY different now. I like it much more now.

STASH LIMIT
- Junk space should be unlimited, not a paid subscription. I agree on a paid subscription for unlimited stash (all kind of items), but for junk, it should always be unlimited. It's not a cheap game. The stash limit really does get in the way when you want to have fun past level 20. It really is an issue and should be urgently addressed.

Bethesda lied to everyone saying an unlimited stash was not possible due to server overload issues, but then it comes with a subscription based unlimited stash and suddenly it's not an issue anymore. Turns out they were just waiting for this particular expansion to implement it. With the addition of NPC's players will not complain that much. Players will eventually punish  Bethesda for this game. They were lying all this time. Stash limit is just a lie. It's a way to get more money from you. And subscription is not precisely cheap.

COMPANIONS
- They added companions at last, but need many improvements.

BUGS
- Many of the bugs are fixed, performance is much, much better on PC (bye bye console), but it still needs adjustments, fixes and improvements.

THE UI
- Needs a minimap, needs to display area levels on world map. Maybe these basic features are coming, but they should be a launch-feature. They should be there already.

THE ATOM STORE
- The Atom Store should be cosmetics and cosmetics only. No repair kits, no salvaging bots, nothing at all. Only cosmetics. Cosmetics should also be obtainable via in-game means, even if hard to obtain.

MOD SUPPORT AND PIRACY
- I don't like the idea of mod support, PC players tend to vandalize and deform games with their awful mods, so the no-mod support keeps game integrity intact. If this was an offline solo game then mod support would be nice, but it's not, so no mods, thank you. Keep it that way. If you open private, offline servers, you will also open the possibility of pirating the game (many will do that). Let us keep it this way. The PC community is popular for being extremely toxic, vandalic, but also demanding when it's the community with such incredibly high levels of piracy.

With an online-only game, you keep all those pirates away. Keep improving the game, redesign your subscription model.

OFFLINE MODE
Many only want this game to be offline playable to go and download a pirate copy and play without buying. This is a big nope for you, buy a game if you want to play or f-off.

I can't give this game a recommended, because it has still a long way to go, and making Betheseda renounce to milking players with a sub will be something maybe we'll never see, so the game will never be a true, good Fallout after all. But it's good to admit the game is much better now than at launch. Maybe in another year we can talk in other terms.

FO76 beat my expectations. I actually went in expecting a half done game. I listened to the die hard Fallout fans who were truly disappointed by this game.  

Don't, don't listen to them. This game is wonderful, it has quest, it has NPCs now, it has a market, and its basically a casual survivor game. I work all day, barely have time to play during the day so, this game was perfect. 

Overall, I recommend this game. Its extremely fun, reminds me of Fallout, but without a forced direction. Its fun to explore, its fun to craft, its fun to build, and its just generally fun to play especially with friends!

My breakdown with my 80 hours: (I should note, I've probably only explored 1/4th the world so far)
Pros:
- Great atmosphere
- Fun quest
- Fun exploring, uncovering secrets
- Collecting toys
- Crafting, building
- Your CAMP logs out with you, not stuck to one world.
- You can play the game how you want
- PVP isn't rampant now
- Entire community is extremely friendly and helpful
- Almost all items are in-game to farm, however the best looking ones are not

Cons:
- There are bugs, a lot of them, not really game breaking, just immersion breaking
- Spawns on some items are very long and you can server hop for days with no luck sometimes
- PVP, while I did say it was a pro that its not rampant, it does seem lacking in some areas now
- Your storage is very limited without FO 1st
- A lot of cosmetics hidden behind a pay wall

	[td]I'm still pretty early on in the story but I really like what I've seen so far! There [i]is[/i] a difference between the vanilla and Wastelanders story content - but every area is lovingly crafted and exploring in this game is actually [i]fun[/i] (so even if there are a lack of NPCs on the vanilla main quest - there are plenty of holotapes etc. to push the story forward)![/td]

	[td]Gameplay[/td]
	[td][b]B[/b][/td]
	[td]It plays a lot like Fallout 4 with some minor changes (the biggest I've noticed being hunger/thirst and the VATS system not slowing time). Inventory management can be a bit of a pain early on - so learn to utilize your stash (you can access the items at your C.A.M.P or any Red Rocket/train station) and break items down. I'm level 15 and I've invested in perks that help me with managing my inventory and it's a lot more fluid now. I've read a couple of reviews talking about needing repair kits to repair weapons/armor (and this being a cash grab because they're hard to find) - but you can repair your items with junk at any workbench (or use a repair kit if you don't have the necessary components) so I don't know where that's coming from. That being said I don't find the cash shop to be aggressive at all - you earn atoms (the currency used in the shop) from completing daily/weekly challenges and the items in the shop are primarily cosmetic anyways. I've already bought a costume from the shop using atoms I've earned through questing and I've only been playing a few days (not to mention the freebies, sales etc.).

That being said there are bugs - nothing game-breaking though (for me at least)! I've seen items floating because they weren't loaded into the world properly (this is generally only in houses/dungeons) - or enemies spawning in but they're frozen/untargetable. These things are more funny to me than anything and don't really take away from the experience for me though (it's a Bethesda game, I kind of expected it). 

Also, the Nuclear Winter game mode is friggin' hilarious![/td]

	[td]I don't regret buying the game at full price! I'm having a lot of fun exploring Appalachia and there are tons of things to do (regular quests, dailies/weeklies, group challenges etc.). For a buy to play MMO with a battle royale mode I think the price is totally fair! I haven't subscribed to Fallout 1st yet - but ESO has the same subscription (with the same benefits) so I don't see why people are complaining about it. [/td]

87,Fallout 76,68859343,english,"If you liked the past games, this one's finally playable with content and certainly has its pros.
If you can get past the fact that your guns are worth 1-3 caps at a vendor, around the same cost if you scrap it and sell its scraps. Yea the economy is broken (intentionally). Plot so far is ""go here, find that"" but levelling has no cap. Have seen levels 300+.

Base building is fun, dumbed down but still fun. Crafting is so far pointless as your guns don't permanently break.

Good things are there. Unlike GTA online, ark survival, rust, player griefing is next to none.
With a friend this game shines. Truly is a joy. The poor npc's are screwed yet the world still keeps its haunting feel. Constantly got more then we could take and loved it. The ai feels the same so far from past games but the dialogues are not that great yet but its not game breaking (they repeat a couple lines over and over). If you are deaf or hearing impaired this game isn't for you when it comes to multiplayer interactions. No Text speak. Would have made trading sooo much better. But hey it only took them like 2 years to get ""npcs"". 

The Dev's seem so confused as their IP is selling yet the community is always angry. But they label the latest update that literally makes the game playable and adds the features that should have been here 2 years ago, as a ""FREE expansion"". Very nervy and it shows their stance on this game. Despite this... The world is huge, the bad guys are scary, the world feels just as alive as the past games, weapon customization is great and as you unlock more mods you can truly make a gun fit your style. Character stats are completely customizable, although from what I can tell there is no respecting of your stats. Although with no max level you can do everything. But this is a feature that is a must as levelling is slow (assuming it isn't possible as I have yet to see it and most information is dated from 2018). 

Grinding is real and never ending but fun with friends. Is the game worth the full price? I don't regret it yet and I am many hours in. The only thing really holding this game back is Bethesda and if you compare this to ark survival at least this one doesn't leave my base online 24/7 leaving my base undefended while my clan and I are asleep or at work, but private servers are priced at around the same. Way overpriced. $17.99 CAD per month. It's not even a fresh server with fresh spawns. But I would love for them to expand on it, like clan fortresses of the same nature. In fact more content towards clans is one of my biggest desires for this game.

Power armour pieces are Heavy, yet the frame is only weight 10. Put the pieces in it and BAM weightless. Magic power armour inventory that magically fits in your inventory at like 10lb. 

Quick Travelling costs caps, and getting caps is brutal. This is the one features of the game that needs a huge overhaul in my opinion. Maybe it gets better? Who knows but its certainly a letdown when a submachine gun goes for like 3 caps. Prices are in no way accurate, free plan valued at 100 caps worth 1 cap to vendors and worthless to players as its free (bed plan for example). Without text chat trading is time consuming. 

Do i like this game? Yes I do, Do I recommend it? Yes, but these are the things that turn me off on it. Maybe you'll see past them as I do or not.

95,Fallout 76,68842689,english,"Everyone knows this history about this game. 
It launched broken, no NPC's, glitches and bugs, poor framerate.

I played this last summer over a free weekend. What made me choose not purchase it was the bad framerate. 
I saw some potential, but the lack of optimization killed the deal.

After seeing the reviews for Wastelanders, I choose to retry this game. I am glad I did.
The framerate has improved on my GTX1070,  I7-7700k, 32 gb of ram.

This game excels as a Fallout game, but also takes a few steps back.

The good stuff: 
Awesome map that encourages exploration. 
Lots of quests, events, dailies, weeklies, areas to loot, 
Base building that puts FO4's to shame. 
Lots of cool and different enemies. (Ran into the Legendary Sheepsquatch, immediately ran for my life)
Lots of weapon/armor customizations
All sorts of ways to earn atoms

The bad stuff:
Combat is not as visceral compared to the singleplayer FO games (this is to be expected, it is a mmo)
Framerates can dip when you go into larger cites/areas (nothing that makes the game unplayable for me though)
Lack of PvP. I feel this game has a home for those who want to PvE, but for us who enjoy PvP, I personally feel homeless. Hopefully Bethesda fixes this soon.

I feel there is a hivemind against this game. Yes, it had a rocky start. Yes, they did some stupid stuff, but this game has a great world with a great foundation to build and add to. The level of exploration in this game surpasses any fallout game I have played. You get the best of two worlds, beautiful autumn forests vibrant with color and nuked out ashheaps as you explore south. I got to shoot ghouls on the greenest golf course I have ever seen in a game, and it still felt like Fallout.

Don't listen to the haters. 

Do they have a point to say this game was atrocious when it released? 
Yes.

Do they have a point to say this game sucks and Bethesda hasn't invested time and energy to correct the course?
No.

If Bethesda can bring back PvP that is balanced (Use the karma system as a starter), get some solid end game content in there and keep adding, taking and evolving this map, this game has some serious potential.

For $40, I think this game is great. It's not the best, but it's certainly not as bad as people have made it out to be. I have been playing this nonstop since I bought it. I have so many things I want to do and when I log in, it's always takes me a couple minutes to plan on what I am doing for the day. Buy the game, judge it for yourself instead of listening to the hivemind, and if it don't work out, refund it. Just don't say no because all the edgelords love to bash this.

So, I paid the questionable fee for Fallout 1st ... except, after diving into the game, it feels like money well spent. Being able to explore the entire game w/ the new NPC's and *no* other players ... it is a joy.

14,Fallout 76,68800255,english,"When it first launched back in 2018, Fallout 76 was scorned for its clumsy execution of a fairly ambitious concept. Bethesda hoped to translate its sprawling RPG vision into a world occupied by other players who could interact, fight and work alongside one another towards a common goal. 

The concept itself sounded incredibly appealing, yet was shoehorned into an engine and gameplay formula which felt fundamentally hostile towards any form of cohesive multiplayer. It was buggy, inconsistent and soulless as it abandoned much of what made Fallout so beloved in the first place. 

It’s languished in mediocrity ever since, receiving an insufficient amount of content updates and failing to shake off the lack of polish that continues to hold it back even several years later. Wastelanders hopes to change this seemingly irreparable reputation, introducing NPCs and a deeper, more nuanced storyline to the world of Fallout 76.  

After spending plenty of time with Wastelanders, it’s clear a distinct improvement has been made. An obvious sense of passion has been put into course-correcting the disastrous origins of Bethesda’s multiplayer experiment, even if the initial cracks are still blindingly obvious at times.

Given time I decided to hop on it again and tho some things are still rough the game has gotten a lot better or atleast in my opinion it has.

Theres a few things i dont really enjoy about the game:

 the main campaign (and some side missions) feels repetitive makes you run through more caps (in-game currency) from fast travelling then you earn at the end of missions.

Player vending isnt the greatest unless you dont like building a C.A.M.P. of your own since the stuff you're trying to sell will stay in the same cache as building & crafting materials and makes it very hard to both sell high level gear and also craft gear and build your camp    

building is different from what it was in fallout 4 since if you want to build C.A.M.P. in 76 you gotta find plans for literally everything even small things like a mattress and a generator or even a chair

last thing is diseases, *your dying of thirst* you drink some water and catch a disease, *dying of hunger* eat some food and catch a disease, *go on a stroll* catch a disease. every minute you get a disease from everything, that make you lose water or food more drastically or get a disease and make you be practically a one shot for low levels",1588400307,1588918652,TRUE,1,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,29,10,6096,1604,3879,1601693896

When first released, yes there were problems/bugs, it lacked content, etc.  However, over time, things have improved, and now with the Wastelanders DLC, I would say this game is up to snuff.

With new story lines and npcs, this game is feeling like what you would expect from a Fallout game.  It has those incredibly funny random events, serious side quests, lots of easter eggs, it's just what we needed.  Now that being said, there is always room for improvement, but at this time, this game is turning out to be decent.  

Although Fallout 1st is kinda feels bad, you have to remember, other games, such as WOW, do the same thing, but to more of a degree, such as you have to buy the base game, then pay 15ish a mouth or so to play.  At least with 76, buy the game and you can play, 1st just gives you more options which help support paying for the servers to keep them online.

Overall, Fallout 76 has grown, and at this point, is worth giving it a try.  As always though, don't just go on my word, or the words of anyone else, watch some videos of other people playing, read up on it and take all that you see and read with a grain of salt.

41,Fallout 76,68758250,english,"To start, Fallout 76 is in a very odd place. In the past two years, the game has had nothing but negativity and very much having lack of content, or so I heard. I started playing the game when Wastelanders came out and in my perspective, it has made the game almost to the point where it should be. 

I say almost because even though new npcs and quests are added, it still needs more. Doing the quest for either the raiders or settlers was great to see diverse sides and approaches but after finishing either questline then makes you feel empty. Leaving only to do events and daily quests.

Not only does the game need more quests, but it needs a lot of bug fixes too. I play on a top of the line gaming PC and when I first booted up the game, I was getting only 40 fps which to me for a AAA title, is appalling and even now the game constantly crashes. I manually had to go into the fallout76prefs just to disable vsync and took me a couple of hours to fix after looking everywhere online. The user interface needs to be changed to allow others to play the game in the best settings possible. But it just maybe be the engine this game runs on, I don't have a clue.

So far, this all has seemed negative towards the game but honestly, if you look past the bugs, crashing, and game quality, there's a ton of different ways to play! Essentially, you can become a god in any play style which is great to see such diversity. Not to mention practically around every corner is a new story to be told and overall the world is extremely rich with lore. Take the time to enjoy the world, immerse yourself with the lore, and definitely check out building! Building is one of my favorite parts in this game.

Much like the goal of the game is to rebuild America, Bethesda's goal should be to rebuild the game itself. As long as they keep updating it and making some huge changes every now and then, this can be an amazing game. It might have been a flop on release, but that doesn't mean the game is a permanent failure.

Pros: 
[list]
[*] I like the new hunger and thirst mechanics.

[*] The weapon durability adds a new survival challenge.

[*] I think it's cool that you can raid other players and can be raided yourself. (Only your stash and things you're holding are safe.) Of course nobody wants to be raided, but that's kinda part of the fun.

[*] You can work with other players, or against them.

[*] I'm really glad that the building feature from Fallout 4 was moved over to the new game.

[*] The map is fairly big. And there seems to be a lot to explore.
[/list]

[list]
Cons:

[*] The graphics aren't too good. It's kind of understandable since it's an online game. But even with the cut back in graphics, I still lag sometimes. A lot of the textures seem to be a straight rip from Fallout 4, which again is sort of understandable.

[*] NPC movement. Bethesda, you need to fix this. This is just stupid. I hope this is the only NPC to do this but I somehow doubt it. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=et7xdSsBYuA

[*] Sometimes there will be a pretty big pause between the lines NPC's speak. Even with holotapes. It really takes me out of the game when I'm sitting there like ""Come on, you can do it, say your line so I can go.""

[*] Sometimes enemies will just rubber band towards you. Sort of unfair because they seemingly attack you from a long distance with melee attacks.

[*] These micro-transactions are WAY too overpriced. $5 for 500 atoms? That's only enough to buy one, maybe two items from the shop.

[*] ""Fallout 1st"" membership. Dumb. It wouldn't be as bad if it wasn't so expensive. But this is the real ""pay to win"" crap. My mode of thinking is: I payed for the game. I shouldn't have to pay any more to win the game. And I won't, but it will probably be harder to win.
[/list]

It is in Bethesda's power to fix it. And if they don't, that shows that they only care about the paycheck. I don't really want to support a company like that, but I love the Fallout series. I know it can be better, because they've made better already.

All in all, I do recommend this game to anyone who's a major fan of Fallout and/or the survival genre. They did just recently update it. If they keep it up, and maybe ask the fans what they want, this will be a great addition to the Fallout series. If you look at it for what it is, it's alright. I'm having fun.

Also someone shot my Brahmin out of the blue so I role play as a cop in power suit and scared the shit out of him (he was a low level guy probably a newbie) and I also run a camp and sell cheap foods and some buff items for passerby. it felt quite good being generous even if it's just a game.

61,Fallout 76,68731364,english,"Let me start by saying I turned my back on this game, as many other players did. Like many players, I saw the vids and knew the game I wanted to play was not in the  release. I kept my eyes on it, and continually saw a confirmation of that decision. The Wastelanders was released and I took another look as the reviews. I liked what I saw enough to roll the dice, expecting little.

Cut to the chase... I like the game. It punched my buttons, which is A.D.D. style of open world gameplay with survival mechanics. It feels like that, with a Fallout 4 experience.

As for the Atom shop... well, I wanted some of the stuff... so I decided to sign up for the much maligned 1st subscription... just one month. Hey, you get caps and some free stuff. I knew I would be disappointed with the Private World, as it is not a true game server hosting. But, I wanted the skins, caps, and stashbox... and after watching a vid that explained what you keep after cancelling, I pulled the trigger.

This is as much a review of 1st as the game itself, as I already said I enjoy the game.

The movable CAMP:
This this is awesome. I use it all the time, and it is a significant value addition to the package. By itself, it is easily worth half the monthly.

The ATOMS:
you get 1600 of them a month. That's pretty compelling, as the ATOM shop cycles sales weekly, and although I am not too into the skins, I do like the CAMP additions.

Private Worlds:
This is not what you think, but it is valuable. It is not a private hosted game server. F76 is a series of instanced gameworlds that are shared. This is another instanced world, but you get to decide who gets added to is... you can invite some friends or solo. Why solo... ? I mean, the other players set up great vendor shops and help with events! Well, there is another element to the game... Workshops. These are captureable bases that give resource nods and devices. They have there own scrap pools that allow you to build up defenses, which you will need from the waves of Events that will periodically occur. By taking one of these Workshops, you get experience, resources, and exclusive crafting devices, as well as the gameplay of defending them from assault. In public worlds, you also have to defend them from other players... with is a fun mechanic, but sometimes you just want to mine resources/product, and play against the machine. That is where private worlds really shines. You do not have to deal with player raiding/griefing for those solo/coop times. I'd say that is worth a few bucks a month.

All together... I can see the appeal of buying 1st for a year, as that breaks down to 8-9 bucks a month for alot of ATOMS and features... and I get to participate in the ongoing dev work to keep the game alive with fresh content.

So that is my 2 cents. YMMV.

Limit on storage, limit on caps... Completely random enemy levels... lagging, rubber banding... PVP where a level 300 will 1 hit you.

Even with the content update it's still pretty bad.
The story isn't as compelling as other fallouts, but if this one were offline, supported modding etc. It would actually be a great game, but the AI / quests / gameplay are broken because of constant server issues such as rubber banding, ai freezing, server lag...
Server issues.
Enemy spawn issues - there will be super mutants mole rats, raiders all within 50ft of one another, sometimes its hoards of them fighting each other causing the server to lock up constantly after a lockup the ai will go passive to each other, sometimes even you.
One time I went into a building, there was lvl 50 stingwings and bloated ghouls, I walked in/walked out it reloaded as level 10 scorched, level 10 rats the enemy difficulty made no sense. Neither did it fit into the lore. [There was a person saying scorch overwhelmed them, but they cleared the place out...]
Sometimes level 100 enemies spawn against you because a lvl 100 player was in that area a couple hours ago... sometimes only lvl 1 enemies spawn on you. 
Gear is level locked, so even if you spend an hour killing a level 100 you only get the same xp and an unusable item.
Inventory/stash is terribly small, you need to specialize and constantly manage. I'm forced to be mostly melee 
Workshop stuff is saved to the location in the server so you always lose the resources, also a level 100 player can come one hit kill you and take everything + steal your caps.
Your hud is broken because quests overlap your health/ammo
Sometimes stuff despawns.
Sometimes you lose progress because the server auto saves infrequently.
Loot is random - enemies will hold an axe, but actually looting them will give a knife. I loved in fallout that you could loot everything off of a person it was immersive, this is mmo trash
Terrible graphics.
Spamming you with the atom shop - my atoms from before are missing...
Small storage space.

75,Fallout 76,68702761,english,"TO BE CLEAR:  Given the rough history of this game, there will always be unconscious bias, particularly with players who have owned and played Fo76 pre-wastelanders.  The bulk of negative reviews come from those players.  I want to be clear that I did not buy or play Fo76 until it came to steam due to the fallout (pun intended) of it's awful launch.  As such, I am reviewing through fresh eyes and a clean experience as best I can.

THE GOOD:
The Fo76 world is, in my opinion, hands down the best world in the franchise to date, and not just because of its size and 16x the detail.  It's vastness does make one feel truly embedded in Appalachia with the sense there's always more to explore and not so small that exploration becomes repetitive.  The art and detail of the game as well as the specific regions and locations are great as well.  I have found few locations that are barren of any value, that's to say even the most small and out-of-the-way locations have at least some loot if not NPCs or a quest affiliation.  The beauty of the Fallout games 3 onward has been the open world roleplay, and this is probably the best game thus far in staying true to it.  There's something extremely fulfilling about being able to play solo through all the quests and play exactly how YOU want, but then getting to run into real people to share (show off) your achievements with, such as your cool armor, loot, or CAMP, etc.  There's an extra sense of game accomplishment that only a multiplayer game can offer, and I think this is exactly why I prefer multiplayer games in general.

On the topic of multiplayer, the community world events are fantastic in a general sense.  Certain events are better than others in terms of rewards or game play, but in general, the events are worthwhile, especially lower level ones when starting out, and make it fun to play with other players in co-op when you please.  When soloing for long periods of time, it's actually really nice to see a sentient being once in a while to avoid the depressing sense of loneliness that initially plagued games like No Man's Sky.  

The CAMP system is tons of fun, and more importantly, has actual purpose.  Planning and strategically building your camp has distinct advantages over a system of arbitrarily having a base of your own.  As you play you will accrue vast amounts of junk and scrap, almost to a fault (we'll get there), so if you want to accumulate resources without scouring the wasteland, you can build your camp on various resource nodes around the world to gather materials passively.  Player vending is a great way to earn caps off of sales.  As they say, one person's garbage is another person's treasure.  And in a more superficial sense, it's a blast to deck out your place exactly how you please.

THE BAD: 
There aren't many issues that I would consider to make Fo76 a non-starter.  I'll summarize in a brief list of what issues exist, as they aren't that complex.

- There are still some animation bugs here and there (NPC clipping objects, interaction delays or being frozen, hit reg, etc) but nothing fundamentally makes the game unplayable or unenjoyable. 

- CARRY CAPACITY! I would say pre-level 30 this hardly matters, but toward mid to endgame levels, the amount of stuff you accumulate is more than your stash can possibly handle in a way that isn't endlessly annoying.  Is it manageable? Yes.  Is it annoying? Definitely.  My tip to navigating the stash capacity issue is simple: scrap all your junk, but USE EVERYTHING right away if you have even the slightest use for the things you craft.  As time goes on you will realize which scrap materials you need more than others, so only scavenge materials you want to cut down on space.

- A minor Pay 2 Win aspect, but frankly, it's a non-issue.  In my mind, pay to win means paying money to gain an advantage in winning something in a competitive sense.  But here's the thing, while Fo76 is multiplayer, it does not revolve around player competition at all.  If someone wants to buy Fo 1st to get a second camp to stash any time they want they can do that and pay for the convenience.  But in no way does someone paying for convenience perks affect MY gameplay.  It isn't pay to win if they aren't winning someone that my expense.  Now, some people think the atom shop offering repair kits to repair weapons rather than using your scrap materials is a big deal.  I think that's bollox.  Remember, having TOO MUCH crap is a bigger problem.  I have never needed to use a repair kit from the atom shop because I was so starved for components.  And when i lacked components, i had other functioning weapons to use to get off my ass and go to some more looting.  The MxTs in this game are there if you want them, but other people using them will not affect YOU in any way if you don't want to spend more money.  

-Writing is...meh.  But frankly, unlike the single player Fallouts that revolve around a story, Fo76 excels in the aspect that while there are main and side quests, the expansiveness and even most basic writing bolsters more of the generalized Fallout lore, which is fascinating.  I find myself frequently connecting dots between games and having ""ah ha!"" moments about lore from random scraps and notes i find all around.  Bethesda was upfront in the very beginning that this was the original intent of the game, to begin with.  But if you're looking for some Oscar worthy writing and Guillermo Del Toro story telling, you need not purchase.

The Ugly:
When the game crashes (which isn't as often as figured it would be), it CRASHES.  The handful of times the game has crashed my whole PC needed a reboot even after all the typical troubleshooting.  This is the single biggest frustration i have, but it has also been a few days since the last crash, so perhaps either a patch or my own driver updates have solved the problem.

CONCLUSION:
It's a good game.  A great game?  Well, that's too strong of a declaration over something so subjective.  What I can tell you is that I am having some of the most fun I've had from a AAA title since the 2016 Doom.  And in the end, that's what matters.  If you want to have fun playing a game, as you should, then I would recommend this game without hesitation.  Wastelanders should be considered the true starting point for the game and I hope it only gets better from here.

16,Fallout 76,67563210,english,"Update. we're all about 80-100 hours in and the game is broken. It took me four days to get an NPC to function correctly and acknowledge I completed a quest. Events glitch out, and make it impossible to complete. You're defending your base from an attacking horde and one glitches in place, you can't kill it or interact with it, you can't close out the event. You just need to leave the area and fail the mission to reset it.
You build your camp, and put fallout's famous turrets around it to protect it. If they can see each other, they will glitch and start shooting at each other and disable each other, leaving your base undefended. Likewise, you bring home an 'Ally' NPC to mind your base, and they'll glitch out too and start shooting at your own defenses. You can't interact with them while they're glitching out, shooting up your camp, 'this person is busy' And I am not the only one to notice, but sometimes, when you shoot a creature, their health bar doesn't drop, or it reverses. You shoot something, it's health bar drops by 10%. You shoot them again, their health bar refills and drops by 10% again, so you've made no progress.
Really annoying things: A lot of the quests tend to glitch out. There doesn't always seem to be a good sign that it's been acknowledged or picked up by you, the player. There are also a lot of books, notes, tapes, and computer logs to read or go through. There is also an annoying number of 'computer exams'. Now the problem with this is you can totally be attacked by something while you're looking at a computer screen. Also, even if you kill everything in the area to buy yourself some time to look at a computer screen, if a Player comes into the area, the enemies instantly respawn, and can respawn at THEIR level. So my level 28 self is now getting hit with level 40 mobs, while I'm hitting the button 20 times to back out of the computer screen and fight back. 
The in game economy is broken. They really wanted to rely on PC to PC trade, and there are somethings that are in high demand and everything else is basically worthless, and not much in between. A few exceptions are things that trickle down from crazy high level players. 

I can't honestly tell people to rush out and buy this game. I feel like it's telling that all of us can turn it off and take a break from it. We're all Fallout/Skyrim junkies with hundreds of hours under our belts. I don't come home and jump on the game, I don't lose track of time playing it, I don't have that 'one more quest' itch I got with previous games. I, and my friends, can literally say 'That's enough of that' and take a break from it for a day or 3. It's a fallout game that you can walk away from, and that's kinda sad. 

Original Post: Still stand by it
Full disclosure, Almost 100% of my experience has been on a private map. A friend of mine bought the game when it launched, hated it, returned it. A year later, a family member gave him a year's worth of Fallout First, unaware he stopped playing, so he decided to revisit it, and me and a few of my friends are riding on his coat tails.

Weapon conditions degrade quickly, because they want you to buy weapons repair kits in the Atom Shop. So I'm running around carrying 3 shotguns, because they last as long a milk left in a hot car. Everything is super scarce compared to previous games. You can't even take clothes off body, they want to sell you different looks in the game. You come across a few outfits in game, but nothing like your used to, if you've played 3, 4 or NV. Which is good, because your carrying weight is greatly handicapped. You can argue that it's more realistic, but lets be honest: Try running around with 160 pounds strapped to your back some time. Realism has left the building.

I'm using an X box controller, which makes navigating the wonky menus as challenging as the game. In previous games, you could favorite weapons and select them from the wheel with the D Pad. Not any more! Up and D opens the wheel, then you need the right stick to highlight the equipment you want, then you need to select it with the A button. Try doing that during a running gunfight. They had to do this because half the D pad is dedicated to emojis.

It cost caps to fast travel, because F&$K you, that's why. Vats is virtually useless, which doesn't bother me one way or another. As for the Fallouty bits, they added some story, and it's as weak as herbal tea. Easily the weakest of the franchise. 

Honestly, I don't think I'd play without my friends. We're all on discord, having the time of our lives, but once we get away from one another and start going on our own, it starts to fall flat. It's essentially Fallout 4 with less intuitive mechanics, harsher limits and pay walls. I feel like Private Maps should be a one time purchase and not a subscription  Am I enjoying myself? Yes. But less than half of its the game. If I was going it alone, I'd just play Fallout 4 and call it day. If I got bored, I'd mod it.

18,Fallout 76,68639060,english,"Fallout 76 is a game that made me wonder a bit. It was released about the time, I came back to gaming after a ten year break and I played it from day 0 on. I liked it very much, yet it got a lot of hate and flaming from all kind of different sides. Most people, who hated tho, havent played even a single minute.

Granted the engine is fo4 warmed up and there is nothing innovative here, but tho its old its still good. The combat system, aiming, shooting and fighting is as dirty as in fo4 and no thing for people, who like fine adjustments to the weapon physics like in Rainbow six or Counterstrike. Yet what was good from the start, was the survival aspect. Now they prolly made the start into the game easier, especially since the Wastelanders upgrade there are people greeting you and gearing you up, but back then you were thrown into a lonely World with not much of a starting gear. Thirst and hunger were constantly lurking on your way to getting set up and other players. It has a good survival feel to it in the beginning and the atmosphere and detailed and complex World made you nervous and look behind every tree. 

Later on the survival part gets lost, I am pretty geared up and found my rythm. You need your spots to grind for necessary materials like ammunition, but you can earn it trough combat as well. You can of course increase the difficulty level for the survival aspect again when you join a server or join a more pvp-oriented world. No need for a new character.

The quests hold some very good suprises. Intresting stories to follow with fo-typical macabre and funny twists. With the new Wastelander update and NPCs joining Appalachia I suspect the amount of intresting Quests has increased. 

The map is kinda small but holds great detail. You may want to take ur time exploring it. I am level 43 now and am still missing some parts. 

I build a small house in the woods as a basecamp to craft ammunition and better weapons and have fortified it against mob attacks. This is a funny part of the game, but nothing I put too much time into. 

Often people complained about the map being deserted, what is true for certain areas, but I actually like that and think it creates a lot of tension and supense. The World is very colorful and detailed and often its hard to spot a hidden mob or player sitting in the trees. Running around in the woods, being killed by a deathclaw two seconds later you havent seen coming, is very exciting.

The game takes time and it is extensive to build up your gear on higher levels, you will need more and more rare materials. Yet its pretty chill and made for casual gamers. You can solo play this game too without problems. 

Before the Wastelander upgrades there were no human NPCS (only robots) which was kinda funny. Cause with every remnants of a extinct group of people you stumbled upon, starting a quest, you always knew how it ended: they all died out. Yet you never knew how and with some quests there were some intresting twists. That should evolved now tho, cause you have human NPCs now. But they kept the old quests too.

So for fo lovers its a must-play in my eyes, at least you have to check it out to form an opinion.

Atm it runs pretty flawless on Linux. I use Proton-5.6 GE2 by glorious eggroll together with aco and have a constant frame-capped 60 fps normal gaming experience. The engine tho had some issues in the beginning and probably still can have.

I love the Fallout series. I have more hours logged offline than I do online over steam due to internet issues.
When Fo76 was announced? I nearly wet myself like a puppy with excitement.
As the controversies rolled in? I died a little inside. I went from being excited to angry. 
I badmouthed and hated the game with a passion without ever playing it, and have spent awhile avoiding it.
Wastelanders didn't fix everything, but It did make the game worth playing. I picked it up alongside my wife and the two of us have had a lot of fun playing through the game and enjoying both the little bits of lore and story stuck in the game here and there and finding neat stuff in the out of the way places.

Find a gaming community and play it with friends, I sprung for the one year fallout first subscription because it'll be cheaper in the long run, versus paying for a year individually. It's worth it for 'recycled' private servers when you want that 'sole survivor trying to figure shit out'. 

As for the grind? It's like any other fallout - you have to go searching for the stuff you need.
Grafting, building, cooking and rebuilding guns can fill in nay extra gaps. I average two levels a day over an 8 hour session (Retired stay at home dad/Covid-19 lockdown.

22,Fallout 76,68631731,english,"I'm writing this review after the game crashing funny enough but best believe I'll be diving right back in as soon as I get this overdue review over with. First things first...this game WAS complete dog poopie when it was first released. Empty world, uninteresting quests/motivation to keep playing, super inflated micro transaction store (still in place at the moment) and glitches glitches glitches galore. 
I played Fallout 76 for the first time on Xbox One (free for a limited time) and it looked awful/played even worse. I shut it off a few hours into it and I forever thought that Fallout 76 was a cash grab from Bethesda and it really made me question the company and their motivations for the series as a whole. 
Introducing Wastelanders!! 
I'll admit I laughed when I saw Fallout 76 in the Steam marketplace and thought how I would never waste money on that piece of garbage ever again. People were review bombing it at launch and I agreed with them at the time.
Couple of weeks pass and I see all negative reviews turn to mixed, and mixed to somewhat positive and now mostly positive. I thought, huh that's strange. So I read all of the reviews, good and bad, and made an informed decision for myself to give F76 another chance. So the first PRO that I noticed...

PRO:
It looks way better than console, obviously because PC MasterRace and I have beast Gaming Rig. Not a huge fan of the over saturation in some areas but I would be lying if I said the map as a whole is gorgeous filled with so much content, lore, and just interesting things to see in general (Unfinished Mansion comes to mind and I haven't even explored the whole map)

CON: There really is a metric ton of areas to explore and items to find so the OCD/ADD inside of me starts screaming and I feel overwhelmed at times with how much there is to do. (Some people may disagree/agree with this point. This CON is completely personal for me so take it with a grain of salt and decide for yourself)

PRO: HUMAN NPC'S FINALLY...the world isnt full of just robots, scorched, super mutants only anymore! We actually have HUMAN NPC's with dialogue, lore and quests to boot! They brought back the Fallout 3/NV dialogue tree and I kind of prefer it to Fallout 4's at times but not all the time.

CON: Some/most of the Human NPC's are kind of bland and give out generic fetch quests. Still...Human NPC's are better than none. 

PRO: Crafting returns as well as base building. I personally think its pretty cool roaming Appalachia and coming across players unique creations. The player base is extremely nice and more often than not willing to part with a few items from their inventory to help a new player out. No catch!

CON: Inventory management is a chore...everything you collect must be put into a Storage Container that follows you throughout servers. Its limited to 800 lbs right now. Idk about you but I'm a hoarder in Fallout. Whether it be weapons, apparel, or junk. Especially junk bc its used for all modifications to your weapons and armor. If you fill up that 800 while playing its going to be a pain in the ass managing inventory. I suggest taking duplicate items/items you wont use and find a vendor to sell them at.

PRO: Not nearly as glitchy as the game was during launch and even a year after. 

CON: Still plenty of bugs to find but so far all the ones I have come across arent game breaking they are just ugly or annoying. 

PRO: If you have a friend or friends to play this with I imagine that as long as all of you like Fallout then it will be a great time. Its as close to Fallout 4 with friends we have at the moment and its fun.

CON: Performance is hit or miss with a lot of PC's. Optimization didnt appear to be priority when this game got ported over from consoles and it shows. Hopefully it will be fixed.

So far I have put about 23 hours into this game and I'm not even LVL 20 yet. (Might just be bc I am a slow player and like to explore/take in scenery rather than repeat the same cycle of Exploration/Combat/Gathering. I 100% am forgetting a lot of things but I felt like I owed this game a fair/honest review after dogging on it for so long. I am actually enjoying my time with it and highly encourage anyone who liked Fallout 4 to at least GIVE IT A CHANCE.

My first comment is that it is like Fallout 4 (sort of) but it is not Fallout 4 the experience is different but feels familiar, this in my eyes is not a bad thing and it is getting updated with new content like most games do these days.

Now I have read the other reviews and one that I see often is inventory management, There's not enough space blah, blah... Personally Fallout 4 was the same you had to manage your inventory it is the same here. But I don;t understand why you need to fill so much space? Manage your stuff correctly and it easy get what you need for what you need at the time.

The other is the Atom Shop, now all those that moan forget to mention you can earn the Atom Shop credits in game, Yes you can EARN them and you can get a lot of them, save them up then buy that skin you really want. Or you can buy them if you are impatient and don't want to earn them.

Mission/Quests.
Guess the usual stuff like they have been for some years, normally find something, kill something and fix something. If you have played other Fallout games you will know what I mean.
There are events in the world you can join which is pretty cool and can get you interacting with other players.

PVP.
To be honest the Adventure there isn't really much, Nuclear Winter usual Battle Royal but Fallout Style.

I feel like if I put much more here i'll start adding spoiler's, My advice would be maybe watch a few bits online  get a feel for the game, not the developers ones they always fancy them up. 

(If you spent your time cheating in Fallout 4 you will prob's not like this game)

Personally I am loving the game, Its another Fallout game and now I can play with others if I choose.

Update:

I now have 100 plus hours on the game and I have only just finished 1 main story line. So there are plenty of hours game play.

The reason I am updating is that I am seeing comments from die hard Fallout Fans who just can't seem to just treat this as a new game. 

The Atom Shop seems to be a thorn in some's rears- So what if there is a micro transaction shop you don't have to buy the skins for your power armour most look cool on their own, Also what they all forget to mention is you can buy or find most of the CAMP items either from vendors or in the world or you can buy them with Atoms if you so choose. AGAIN you can earn credits for the Atom shop.

The game is keeping me entertained and I can tell you honestly if it wasn't I wouldn't have put this many hours into it.

Fallout New Vegas was released as an unfinished game and was better than F4, I've sank more hours into F4 entirely due to modding the hell out of it. FO76 is just F4 but worse and without the ability to add mods and the occasional lag spike because you have to pay $100 for a private server...

I bought the game for PS4 when it first game and played it until I got bored, and I've bought it again on Steam and gotten bored at the exact same time and place in the storyline.

67,Fallout 76,68589725,english,"I am writing this review because I noticed that people ""hate"" this business model. If you are really interested in this game, let me tell you how it is from perspective of someone who have never played any Fallout before, but I felt in love with this one.

Many complain about ""subscription"" and how unfair is it. 
Remember, they said that DLCs will be for FREE!!!!  In games like World of Warcraft, or Final Fantasy, you have to buy a game in full price (rarely discounted, unless its halfway till another DLC), and then you pay monthly subscription to even log in, AND THEN you pay another full price for EACH DLC.

Atomic shop (microtransaction store) >

99% of all the items are cosmetics, then, there are ""Scrap"" and ""Repair"" boxes. Let me tell you, they are useless, I have NEVER EVER used Scrap boxes (google fo76map and find nearby workbench you can scrap for free, they are usually very close). All materials are super easy to get, and with the right perk, you can repair to 200% of durability.

Collectrons - This is a ""building"" for 500 atoms. This bot has console, and it will collect stuff for you (has very limited capacity). So either junk, scrap, food (based on the type).

You CAN GET THESE FOR FREE - Yeah, In the game, there are tons of challenges, and I think they even update all the time -  I farmed like 1k+ atoms in a day/two of playing, which is enough to buy two types of collectron.

Yeah, that is all for Atomic shop that gives you advantage.

Fallout 1st - they give you 1650 atoms to spend in the store for free for every subscribed month.
1) It allows you to create private servers - the advantage is, that if someone bothers you, or the location you would like to build you camp is full, you can make ""your own"" server, that will have no players in it - However, up to 8 friends can join you (without sending an invitation).
2) Unlimited Scrap Box - Scrap are basically the most ""basic"" material for crafting, this helps to manage the space better. But remember, you CANNOT put anything else in it. So you will run out of space as quickly as people without it.
(for those without, put your scrap into bulk, which will save tons of space). 
3) Survival Tent - allows you to place tent in the wild - it has Stash, cooking station, bed and music instrument - I find it useful only to put scrap back, or pickup ammo. You can ""fast travel"" to your tent for free, so you can teleport to your base, and back for free.

That is all. Yep.
I used to pay the same ammount or more for different mmo subscriptions just be able to play.
Here, I get 1650 atoms per month, so I dont feel guilty when I dont play the game I paid for, because I can use it for fun cosmetics that are available only there.

In cosmetic store, there are daily and even WEEKLY discounts, and whole packages that contains regular costumes or power armor costumes.

Because I'm playing knowing that I wasted my money and wasting my time. After more than 40 hours, I will not delete the game until I finish the main quest.

There is an unnecessary and aimless difficulty in the game. Fallout 2 is easier than Fallout 76. For example, your level is 15 and you go to the main mission. You don't know what will you face at wherever you go, but then suddenly you come across creatures over 35 levels and even legendary bosses! Even if your level is 35, you have a hard time killing legendary creatures, which 5-10 levels more than your level.

There is a annoying bug; when you are not under attack, your armor or even your weapon can be broken due to bugs. Also, sometimes, durability of weapons decreases in 4-5 magazines.

When you do fast travel to a place, you fall into unexpected places. It might even be a cliff edge. Also, the game starts when you are falling from some height and your health decreases.

Some main quests and side quests cause time loss. I cannot say that there are no good sides; with your friends, you can hunt down legendary creatures of ""unbalanced levels and powers"".

99,Fallout 76,68546258,english,"Do I recommend this game?
Short answer: Yes.
Long answer: Yes, BUT......

Fallout 76 is great, I'm having a lot of fun with it but there have been and still are issues with the game. Starting off with the core gameplay itself. I'm currently only level 23 and for the most part, it's been fun and not too challenging to get to this point, however, once I reached level 20 which is when I could start the raiders and settlers quest from the Overseer, the game suddenly fucked me over and I was all of a sudden facing level 35-70 floaters, ghouls and scorched.....seriously?
I assume enemy leveling goes off higher level players in the general area, but my god the enemy leveling is atrocious. My weapons do basically nothing, I get one tapped, run out of meds, run out of ammo all whislt trying to read a terminal entry or to grab a holotape. This is probably my biggest issue with the game currently and some quests are nearly impossible to finish because of this. 

My second issue is bugs. I've gotten stuck inside walls 3 times, twice whislt being chased by enemies who could still damage me, but I could not damage them. My junk has dissapeared twice after dying. I've returned to where I died, no bag of junk. Thanks game. The audio will become really quiet as well, cant hear footsteps, radio is barely audible, reloading sound is barely audible as well, yet everything else is loud. Sometimes the tab key stops working so I cant access my pipboy (keyboard is not the issue) but the fix for this is to simply alt+tab in and out of the game and that seems to fix it? 

I wont even go into Bethesda's disgusting business model and management of this game because we already know about that and that's initially why I didnt buy this game, but my love for Fallout got the better of me.

Overall, im enjoying it minus the 2 problems I've listed. I am glad you can play this solo and forced interaction isnt shoved down us solo players throats. I'm enjoying it more so than Fallout 4 and I think the reason for that it, you're character is a blank slate, plus Appalachia is a much more superior wasteland than the Commonwealth. Both in variety, style and size. 

If you want a good Fallout game, buy it. Its sating the Fallout itch I've had for years that Fallout 4 never managed to quite get at.

9,Fallout 76,68532022,english," I wanted to put a good amount of time into the game before I really gave it a final decision but after 75 hours, I can say that this is a no-go. It's definitely a Fallout game resembling Fallout 4 with its few bugs of enemies spawning through the floor or outside the quest circle. However, it is not like Fallout 4 with its story or level progression. I was able to make it to roughly level 50 relatively quickly and noticed that I was moving from zone to zone rapidly. The zones are recommended for certain levels but what the game doesn't tell you is that it does not only recommend you be that level, but all your weapons and gear should be that level too if you want to not run out of ammo and not have all your items break. Once you're items break or you run out of ammo, you are then stuck with trying to find materials to craft/repair said items. In Fallout 4 you would beat the game, get a sweet set of power armor, and then spawn in the materials to build these amazing settlements. With Fallout 76, there is really no easy way to gain these crafting materials and so you must either engage in PvP to claim a settlement for its resources (Although they are nothing like the settlements in Fallout 4) or you have to roam the world looking for junk to then scrap for the materials. I am now stuck at a part of the game where I have no ammo, no more storage for my items (You are limited unless you subscribe to their monthly subscription which is not really worth it in my opinion), and the areas that I need to be in are way too difficult for my gear/weapons even though my level is well beyond the recommended level.

22,Fallout 76,68514074,english,"I wish there was a 'Maybe' option but I'll lean towards a recommendation because the first 50 hours of the game has been good and there is so much content to be had. Expect to reminisce the older series, enjoying the picturesque quality of the game as you explore the vast lands, and learning the game's unique collecting/scrapping system. Built my house and haven't looked back since, the perfect location overlooking the lake right next to the infested-scorched carnival, which was also a convenient location to kill random mobs for extra experience, and collecting plastic during your spare time for those bulks. Survival element adds realism and fun to how you approach the world such as choosing what to brew, or building a purifier to quench your thirst to maximize your AP (stamina). For food, maybe cook some ribs from wolves who tried jumping you when you were making your way back to camp.

However the long-run approach is something I can't recommend to a non die hard Fallout fan just yet. I think this game has so much to offer especially with a strong community and devs who has put so much sweat and blood into F76 Wasterlanders. But right now it needs to find a middle ground of what makes Fallout great but also incorporating elements of a multiplayer game. Furthering my thoughts in pointers:

- To fast travel, you need to spend your caps and the only way to reduce this is through a perk card. This certainly discourages use of fast travel  unless really necessary and using hard earned caps I'm not willing to spend. I guess the silver lining is the game makes you explore uncharted territories (and make you pick up more junk on the way) 
- Speaking of junk, the game focuses on you picking up almost everything because every item has a purpose and carries parts to crafting, modifying weapon, armor, and your camp. This is a crucial component of the game as you will be doing a lot of crafting and collecting/scrapping junk becomes a huge part of the gameplay
- You will be seeking guides online because you find yourself accepting quests based off dialogues, trails, and logs. Understand backgrounds of each mission you take up unlike many other MMOs which just needs you to kill a number of mobs to complete and level up
- F76 dives into the MMO arena but it's simply more of a co-op multiplayer game which is great if you have friends playing with you. Playing solo, there is no way to engage into conversation except for gestures which doesn't help to interact first encounters. It was weird seeing random players just strolling around or 'riding on' your events without the ability to talk to them in a generic sense
- Character building is extremely important yet strict so if you don't research the route you want, you might have trouble sticking to your character because you can never re-spec (although I understand that once you've maxed your level you're able to somehow select new cards but I guess this requires a huge investment of time)

If you love the Fallout series and want something new, I would say give this a try because I did and don't regret buying this at launch (Wastelanders).

FO3.              Alas, where to begin. The story began long ago in a dark bedroom, on an Xbox-360, experiencing a special game. That fantastic game, was Fallout 3 and from my 12 year old brain I couldn't seem to imagine anything better. Sadly, one part of the game still bugged me. With nearly all my friends  playing it simultaneously, we could talk about it, but we couldn't play together! So this led me to wonder about a new imaginary game. What would Fallout, this game of imaginative storytelling, a fleshed out world and a diverse RPG mechanic system be like online. 

FO4.             I pondered that question as I slayed my way through 2015's Fallout 4. Unfortunately,  it's one glaring shortcoming being a voiced protagonist. This became self evident early on, with flat dialogue choices and meaningless interactions. Honestly, at the end of the day you can only possibly record so many lines of dialogue . Nevertheless, with what Bethesda could with (The Creation Engine) they improved upon almost everything in Fallout 4. The world almost seemed to come alive as I had imagined it in my head years earlier with Fallout 3 and NV. The firearms felt responsive, the gunplay crisp and meaty. Ghouls and violent creatures charged at you out of the darkness with an almost unbelievable amount of speed. You were seriously scared for your life as you fought them back. Quickly rechambering the bolt of your hunting rifle just quick enough for the masses as they lumbered towards you. I soon came to realize how smooth of a shooter and how enjoyable the firearm combat had become in Fallout 4. The game had come so far in many ways but was still lacking in others. Character movement was faster, almost to fast... As a normal walk was almost like a sprint in previous games and a sprint became a FPS draining charge.  Yet, besides all this: jumping and trying to get over and around objects was still like playing back in 2008.  Have you ever heard of the mantle feature Bethesda? Moving on, crafting became a big updated feature and I personally enjoyed it. Now all that random junk around places actually meant something and made the world feel more fleshed out! I loved the game and only a few things irked me about it.                                                                         Although there were some glaring negatives. Outside Area FPS Drops and and FPS drops while sprinting were aplenty for me personally as well as in cities. Some clipping errors, but mostly performance.
                                                    
F0.76.              Finally we reach it, the Coup de gras Fallout 76. I'll try and keep this one really simple. I played during the Nuclear Winter BETA weekend and really enjoyed it but never came back since. I'm scrolling around Steam the other day and low and behold Fallout 76! With a few days of debate I picked it up and have been loving it!!!! As of now i'm level 50 and haven't really quested. In Fallout 76 for me exploring is just as rewardable as questing! Fallout 76 feels like an Online Expansion of Fallout 4 using mostly old and newly added assets with a new map. Either you're okay with that or you're not(Creation Engine Baby).... It employs a new camping and crafting system and that plays itself nearly identically to Fallout 4's. There's a light thirst and starvation system as well, plus negative character modifiers and ailments. There's a card selection S.P.E.C.I.A.L leveling card/skill system now too that is new. This system allows you to allocate points into a S.P.E.C.I.A.L stat every level which lets you select from a list of card/skills. Also, every 5 levels you receive a free perk card/skill pack for free. They also brought back greatly written conversations with skill checks and no voiced protagonist! It's almost as if they stepped their voice acting up to 11 before this game. Voice acting I would say is better than all other Fallout's. This was probably to compensate for an early lack of no human NPC'S pre -Wastelanders. But the icing on the cake is you can finally play online with other people! Which was a big complaint at first for ""we want solo Fallout"" but you barely have to engage with players if you don't want.  It's awesome finally being able to explore the wasteland and explore with a friend! Although, player engagement is fairly difficult with only in-game voice chat and no text chat. Either way you want it solo, or multi it's still a great time! I have to say it's still badass everytime I see a player party pull up in full power armor!!!!               
That's all about the game that I have to say from me that's positive!                                                                                    Now some constructive criticism for something I love and want to see Improve.

The combat system feels stale by today's standards and the lack of feedback from the environment really takes you out of the game (Nothing happens when you ""strike"" an inanimate object, not even audible feedback). Also...
Why can we still not vault over objects? 
Why do I always build sneaky sniper-like characters in Bethesda games? ... because their melee system is still point-and-click. 

Don't get me wrong, I love traveling the wastes with my friends and the game still has its Fallout charm... but there was clearly lack of effort from the developers on this one (on top of a shameless cash-grab in the Atomic Store).

There are a few bugs here in there and its crashed once but overall its played very well. The missions are a little too much in the fetchy department but thats not so much what i play for.

The server lag can get quite crazy at some times making hit boxes shift a foot or two, and twice i have logged back in to find a quest that i had updated previously wasn't updated anymore. I got killed by an invisible Deathclaw, ran into a headless named Scorched I would have liked the xp for and walked into some Player's house only to have the floor drop out from underneath me and be roasted alive. I tip my cap to that person, as my jimmies were rustled quite thoroughly, yet It's a cool experience. The world is big, really big and there are more dangerous things out there than a front porch deathtrap.

I went ahead and bought the Fallout 1st subscription only because of the scrapbox. I am a pack rat and hoarder. They got me. It's how i have always played Fallout. I am level 15 and already I had filled up my stashbox with scrap. There is also a portable tent you can use to fast travel/craft food/rest/get well tuned plus a scrapbox and stashbox.

I couldn't care less about a story or whether the NPCs are human or machine, I am just in it for the exploration and co-op PVE. I would definitely recommend this as an MMORPG.

51,Fallout 76,68466420,english,"For all potential buyers of fallout 76 Here are the things you need to consider before buying this game. It will all be put under a list of positives, negatives, and subjective game mechanics, and story elements. I also want to note that I'm only experiencing the updated campaign and not any of the wastelanders DLC yet.

The positives: 
- The community is not toxic (as far as I've seen) I've not seen mic spam, harassment of players, or cheaters. Although they exist.
- Some quests still have the same fallout feeling
- NPC's exist and vastly help a main quest that has painfully boring moments.
- Events can be very fun, and help when you need a break from the boring moments.
 
The negatives:
- Glitches exist and can either have a severe or moderate impact on game play experience.
- Nearly every aspect of the game is more of a grind. Examples include weapon upgrades, buying weapons, making a base, leveling up, ect.
- The story has many macguffins, and have few choices. 
- Some parts of the story are a complete bore and may make you quit for good. The Fire fighters are a good example.
- The atomic shop is overly pushed on the player. It has pay to win features, and notifications pop up frequently.


Things that are subjective:
- You are no longer the lone wanderer, the vault dweller, the courier, the lone survivor, or the chosen one. You are one of many players. 
- Fast traveling now costs caps. Take that as you will.
- The game is a semi ""single player"" experience that may deliver a fallout experience.
- If you're here just for the free DLC there is a level cap.

I'm going to have this as recommended, however every player needs to decide subjectively if this is worth it or not.",1588471699,1588471846,TRUE,3,0,0.537084401,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,189,22,4255,0,1026,1592001210

NPCs in the game have really changed the paradigm for FO76, and it works pretty damn well. There are actually people that will appreciate your effort, and it feels like Appalachia is actually coming back to life after the war, as opposed to before where it was scattered camps across the map. 

Not only that, but it has already been pretty much confirmed that the BoS is making a big comeback in the next update. We all know how much Bethesda loves to jerk the Steel pole, so that's no surprise.

Being killed and looted and stolen from was, and still kind of is, my biggest fear. Dead isn't the right word to describe Fallout 76, but i can't think of a softer term. This game is peaceful. Every server I've been on has had maybe ten or so people. You hardly run into anyone. Unless you're playing with friends, Fallout 76 is kind of like a singleplayer game. Sure, multiplayer is encouraged, it is an MMO after all. But I've been able to do one of the things I enjoy most in Fallout: walking. Is the game broken? Yeah, often. Are a lot of things about this game EA levels of microtransactions? Yeah. Do I think Fallout 76 is going to be a No Man's Sky situation? Only time will tell.

PROS :
- A huge world map
- Plenty of mission and content
- NPC (Yes! NPC!)
- Beautiful landmark and dungeons
- Building C.A.M.P is delight
- Fallout 3 Dialog system
- You can still play SOLO
- New Fallout story and lore

CONS
- You can't kill NPC 
- Can't steal their items
- DUMB A.I
- BUGS (invisible wall, object stuck at wall)
- Leveling not as satisfying as Fallout single player style.
- Microtransactions (DUH! It's for aesthetics only but still..)
- Limited item stash (you have to pay fallout 1st for unlimited stash and private world)

82,Fallout 76,68406410,english,"This is the worst Fallout game I played as the online community is TOXIC. I got saddled with a player who spammed derogatory racial terms any time he was near. I didn’t talk to him, or his friends. Then they assumed I was a female and shit got a whole lot worse. I couldn’t figure out how to report the person and had to google it. The end all for me was the player that dropped a nuke on/near my campsite and pretty much made the game unplayable. The radiation would kill me instantly, and I only had three areas I could go to. My game was interrupted for several hours because of a dick with a nuke. I couldn’t reasonably play because someone thought it would be fun to deny me that. I suspect if I logged off the game, and reclogged in I might have been able to get to another server without the radiation. 

The game was very laggy and the NPC audio was horrendous slow and painful. It wasn’t a natural conversation.  

I did encounter other players who weren’t toxic, it just wasn’t in my nature to play with them as like all on line games, it has a theme park feel where everybody is queuing up to do the same things.  The game isn’t set up for independent play as it much more difficult. The enemies will keep respawning ever time another player moves through the area.  

In all, the game wasn’t fun. F**k fallout 76 and the whole fallout series, Bethesda will never get another dollar from me. The MMO suck.

28,Fallout 76,68339033,english,"Man, it's a complicated experience. 

On the one hand, I think it's the best world Bethesda have ever designed. It's clearly built around exploration, and that's always been Bethesda's strong suit. The crafting and base-building mechanics fit in with this nicely, and the survival aspects are basically like New Vegas's hardcore mode. The perk card system is a pretty cool way to build a character, you will not be a jack of all trades and it really feels like the choices matter and directly impact how you play

On the other hand, there's stuff that's incredibly disappointing. I found an interesting area and group of enemies hidden deep underground, and you'd like to think you'd get some loot to fit in with that theme, loot their outfits or at least a unique weapon or something. But instead, their outfit is an Atomic Shop item and their base is filled with generic scrap. So you directly know when you see this in the Atomic Shop that this stuff should have been where they were, and in fact the assets are already on the NPCs- just not for you. You can earn a fair number of atomic shop points just playing the game, but even so it's so much less exciting picking something up from a separate purchasing interface rather than the game itself. 

That type of monetization sucks, and you run into items and features being sold that you know would just be part of the game in past releases or most other developers. I still recommend the game, I'm enjoying it a lot more than Fallout 4 actually, and I think the core is excellent.

The building element is probably it's strongest element, with tons of options. There's a bit of a tutorial phase to get through before you unlock the important things like power generators for your camp. But once you get through it, it's quite enjoyable. They add these workshops that you can take over for resources but force you into PVP if another player wants in. 

I dislike the level-gating in this game. It's very very very off-putting. Running into a lvl 26 deathclaw as a lvl 5 is quite the experience. Also took a while to get used to melee weapons doing so much more than ranged or maybe it's just me?

37,Fallout 76,68331028,english,"Overall, it's an above average game. 6/10 maybe. 
But to be more precise...

Two major downsides that need to be addressed upfront is that it's an always online game. You cannot play it offline on your own. You have to share your experience with a handful of random people online if you desire to play this game on your own. And the other is the microtransaction. I might be okay with a tiny tiny bit of microtransaction, only if it is well justified. But the very first thing you see when starting up the game is advertisement for the atomic shop. Even after a few ours of playing, the game gives you a message.. ingame! that you should maybe consider spending some money in the atomic shop. And of course the infamous Fallout First that merely gives you a private server at the cost for 15$ a month that you don't even have any kind of control over. Friends won't be able to play on it when you are not online. 

Positives:
-Visually they did manage to improve drastically from Fallout 4. Sure, some design aspects are identical, but the rendering quality and the nature aesthetic feels far more defined than its predecessor. 
-It can be played with friends. Sure, any game that you can play with friends is more enjoyable, but that's mostly because you are with friends. I am more focusing on the aspect that they managed to make this system work this reliable. Knowing how janky the original engine was, they put a lot of effort into this to make this work. However, this positive point can also be seen as a negative one for other players - not everyone wants to play Fallout with other people. 
-More variation in its environment. This is both a good and a bad thing. Fallout 76 plays far earlier than any other Fallout game; it plays less than a generation away from when the bombs fell. And yet, it's the most lush and active Fallout out of them all when you'd expect utter destruction. 
-The overall gameplay loop is fun. Not the most appealing in my opinion, but it's definitely well polished. 

Negatives: 
-This is basically an MMO game, which means that the enemies level up with you most of the time. So you rarely have the sense of progression. Visually, the enemies don't change, having you to rely on the UI to check if the enemy is going to be strong or not. And because enemies also adjust their levels for the other players, you might end up encountering fiends that are more than twice the levels above you. 
-Due to it being an online only game... you end up having some lag issues as well. Quite frequent so. Killing enemies and interacting with objects regularly have an annoying half a second delay. For a game where you have to do this a LOT, it gets on the nerves sooner or later. 
-Similar to Fallout 4, this has moved away further from an RPG aspect. In that, everyone starts with the basic stats and eventually you grind yourself up to basically a superman. Gone are the days where you have to balance your skill points that might lead to some areas of expertise being crippled. It has all been replaced by an average counter that slowly ticks up and you can choose on a dime what kind of play style you want to do. This is good to attract larger mass of people but it looses a lot of its flavour and what made it unique. 
-The atomic shop. It's just painful to see it pop up every time you load up your game. It feels like a free mobile game at this point. And that for a full price AAA game. That is in my opinion not acceptable. A very predatory business ethic. 
-Since this is an inline only game, there are no mods. In every Bethesda game, it was necessary for a lot of times to rely on the community to fix the avalanche of issues with the games that the developers won't have the time or budget to fix themselves. Or even adding neat features yourself to be creative and get yourself into the game developer side. That has been taken away. All what is left is the base game that has many minor issues that you will grow tired off until eventually you don't want to play it anymore. The only thing keeping you on it is the hording like crafting system as well as the typical MMORPG traits of dailies and events that are all very similar. 
-If you are interested in the lore - you won't find any here. The continuity from the fallout games have pretty much broken up here. Even more so with the most recent update where for some reason healthy people are alive and well even though the whole world should be pretty much uninhabitable for generations unless you are the lucky ones to be in a vault or high security bunker (or oil platform like the Enclave). 
-Music. Yes, they reuse the same music on the radio from Fallout 4. But the new ones... they just don't fit in this time period at all. They can fit in a post apocalyptic scene, sure. But not in the 50s retro sci fi world of Fallout. 

In the end, it's still a playable decent game. If you enjoy MMO games or have a friend you want to play in a ""Fallout-like"" scenery, then you will get a kick out of it for a good few days. I would recommend this to other people... but not to my friends.

Let me save you a lot of frustration and suggest you do not.
I have no problem being challenged by a game when I'm defeated by the mobs - Live, die, repeat.
But with Fallout 76 I'm being defeated by the frigging PC controls (and you can't remap to the mouse).
In the heat of battle, I am locked onto a creature and out of ammo; I back off - how do I release the lock - escape or tab - oh yeah tab - bring up the wheel, select a weapon with ammo - Oh I'm dead. Quit in Rage.
(This could be so easily fixed if only the weapons with ammo were available and the game switched to the next weapon when the current one runs out of ammo - BTW: Just like Doom Eternal)
Given I have bought the game, I'll probably persevere but why, I ask myself, am I spending hours gaining expertise in such a crappy, frustrating game?
Whatever you are into, FPS, Open World etc. there are much better games out there. (Look at the number of games I've played...)

11,Fallout 76,68250378,english,"While Fallout 76 has gotten better with the Wastelanders update. I am still feeling a sense of longing. The campaign so far is somewhat bland, the loot drops feel heavily limited, and the bugs (which being a Bestheda game are almost an expectation at this point) are numerous. There are several reasons I wouldn't recommend this game quite yet.

(1) Fallout 1st and its associated problems: The lack of storage space for scrap is a major issue and because the only way to get more is paying for the Fallout 1st subscription service. It becomes a major letdown. I also heavily dislike that private worlds are only available with the subscription service. If you and your friends just want to have a world to yourselves you are just out of luck unless you pay monthly for the privilege. 

(2) Weapons/Armor/Ammo and upgrading have made a major downturn: It isn't that i dislike the plan system, but I think it was implemented in a very crappy way. In Fallout 4 you could build at least basic mods normally with low skills, but now you need a plan for everything. Got a new hunting rifle, sorry it comes only with a short barrel and a pistol grip and if you want to make it into a true rifle (I am not even talking about having a scope either) you will need to search the lands for plans. I am not talking about upgraded stocks, nearly every other mod requires a plan. So you find out very quickly that you can't mod anything at all, without grinding hours and hours to find plans around the world to even get basic upgrades. Same goes with armor. The plan system would have worked much better for high quality mods, such as special effects, high level weapon and armor mods, and other things which would make sense.

I also am not impressed with the weapon level systems, as it allows you to find a weapon just to find out you are locked out of it until you reach the correct level. So it becomes a drain on your weight limits until you reach that level, besides the fact that they always seem to drop with the crappiest of mods (which is understandable but if it is the crapiest version at least let me use the dang thing).

(3) caps for fast travel: I get that this is a cap sink but it kind of blows in some ways too. Unless you get lucky and find a stash box nearby you get to fast travel for free back to your camp, but then will likely have to pay caps to fast travel back to where you were at. Caps don't come easy in the early game so it tends to increase the grind.

(4) Technical issues: I have had shots fail to register many times, which can be very annoying in the heat of battle. Enemies failing to engage like they should if you start a fight before the game expects you to. Graphical bugs, missing pip boy, spawning under the world, and spawning into my camp with damaged limbs due to collection detection all make the game more annoying and difficult than it needs to be.

(5) The lack of NPCs really hampers the main questline. Part of the fun of Fallout was meeting all of the eccentric characters and groups you meet along the way. The world feels lifeless sometimes when all you have are Scorched, Super Mutants, and the various creatures scattering the lands. The Multiplayer just doesn't make up for this.

(6) Atomic Shop: Not thrilled about the fact that there are non-cosmetic items in the atomic shop, and that every time you boot the game it tries to throw the atomic shop in your face every time.

(7) Survival Aspects: I get fallout is a survival game, but sometimes it feels more like sims than actually fallout. Your meters drop constantly so rapidly it feels like you are feeding a family of teenagers instead of an adult. Half of your time playing is just looking for food and viable water. So while I understand the inclusion of survival elements it doesn't help a already grindfest.

Some of the good:

(1) The environment is beautiful and has a much better color palate than previous Fallout Games. I never understood why they made the previous games so bland when logically plants would have evolved just like animals did. This game has a very good looking environment.

(2) Lots of places to explore and get lore.

(3) Multiplayer functions decently and it is nice to be able to fast travel closer to your friends.

It isn't that Fallout 76 is a bad game, it isn't. It is just not a very good Fallout game, and until a lot more NPC and faction presence is brought into the world it will always feel somewhat lifeless. Some of the game mechanic changes have been questionable and often lead to more grinding than needed. I have spent 5 hours in the game and have barley gotten that far into it because I have just been trying to set up a stable food and water source for my character. With maybe a lot more love Fallout 76 could become a decent Fallout game, that is of course assuming the monetization doesn't kill it first.",1588179602,1588179629,FALSE,1,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,289,3,418,0,345,1588191190

First off, as you may have heard, this game has improved substantially since launch, despite the litany of glitches and bugs that still plague the game. Yes, it's still super broken and it VERY much shows. I'll just start off by saying that if you have friends that are willing and able, get this game ON SALE and NOT full price. There is, actually, quite a lot to enjoy and with friends it's even better. Now...

I'm risking having this review removed, or locked, but Bethesda is a trash company and the quality of this game shows it. This game is incredibly buggy, has a god awful building system(so bad it gives me panic attacks), brain dead enemy AI, and just overall somehow has better looking and worse looking graphics than Fallout 4. All this on top of having to deal with a poorly optimized game, but what else is new when it comes to Bethesda. You will chug frames at some point, no matter what system you have or what settings you use. Unfortunately, this game is online only, so having the community fix it with mods is a mixed bag of ""Will-they-wont-they"" in-terms of getting banned. Use mods at your own risk when in a public server, OR... buy Fallout 1st ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 

Fallout 1st is a monthly subscription of $12.99 that gives you the luxury of playing in a private world with up to 8 friends. You also get a scrap box that holds infinite amounts of mats so you can use that 800 weight stash box for all those legendaries and useless ammo you'll never use. It's pretty much a meme and is universally hated by nearly everyone, but Fallout 1st is just a scam, do not buy it. The private world should have been free from day 1 and, albeit, the scrap box is great, just goes to show it should have been a free thing from the get go. F1st wouldn't be that bad if it was a one time buy though, just saying.

One final thing, there are microtransactions. People complain about the whole atomic shop thing, but in my opinion, it's not even that bad. You can easily amass Atoms for free just by playing the game and doing daily or weekly challenges. My issue with the MTs is not that they're in the game to begin with, but that the devs focus more on adding new stuff to the shop every month instead of spending time fixing bugs.

46,Fallout 76,68217111,english,"Welcome to fallout 76, where players can craft fully functioning automatic rifles, but have no idea how to craft a screw. 

Seriously, past level 30 the game turns into a perpetual grind of scrap loot. Bethesda has done everything in their power to make getting caps and essential scraps as difficult as possible ""to prevent exploitation"". 

Guns can take up to 8 screws to craft, add in even more screws for each mod you want to add. Guess how many screws you get for scrapping a gun? Zero. couple this in with the fact that your weapons will constantly break since it takes dozens of shots to kill higher level enemies (a level 22 Radrat can take up to two dozen hits from a level 30 gun) and you will be stuck in a perpetual grind of finding more office desk fans to churn for scrap.

You could just buy the screws and ammunition from vendors, but the cost for scrap items and ammo is so ridiculously high compared to how little caps you get for selling items it's just not feasible, especially if you ever want to save enough to buy weapon plans. 

You could also just find the best areas to farm for scrap pieces, except for the fact that instanced zones reset every 20 IN-GAME hours, forcing you to constantly jump around the map (which costs caps to do so) hunting for new areas that you can hopefully get more scrap from than it costs to clear, since almost every instanced area is level-synced. 

I don't even know where to begin with the bugs and glitches... Bethesda has had two years to polish this game, yet vats still doesn't work correctly, half of the enemies in the game just stand around doing nothing while you shoot them, and nearly every perk that is supposed to improve item durability just flat out doesn't work.

If you have poor internet connection, you're in for an even worse time. The servers are so poorly optimized that anything under 30 megabit internet speed results in latency issues and constant disconnects.

Enjoy the game for the first 25 levels, then just uninstall and save yourself the headache.

Pros:
+ Only one raging kid trying to trash talk for about 5 minutes straight, but I was in passive mode doing emotes so he only got more upset which entertained me. 
+ I have met a couple very helpful and friendly people.
+ The atom shop really isn't as bad as people made it out to be. Just cosmetics I don't really want and repair kits that aren't necessary. I bought a few things, but paid $0 because the atoms were earned doing in-game achievements I wasn't even trying to do.
+ It's fun as a coop experience, but it would probably bore me if I had to play solo
+There's a nice base-building system that saves your build when you move locations or log out.
+ Loot has given me just the right amount of ammo drops to leave me swapping weapons and occasionally crafting more 
+ Looting has been rewarding. It's easy to pass up a lot of good stuff if you're not looking.
+ There are many quests along with random events that always gives something useful
+ Enemies can be very challenging, making it better to run away at times
+ Progression can be a bit slow if you're not trying to race through quests, but it's a nice grind that provides multiple perk options per level
+ Full of interesting characters and many surprises

Cons:
- The game starts off with capped framerate which can be changed by editing a file
- The more buildings there are, the more lag. Just fallout things
- Many 1 second freezes when interacting with workbenches and using menus
- Some bugs, but nothing game-breaking that I've seen. I've avoided all issues by changing servers.
- Solo or private sessions with friends is not an option unless you pay a subscription, but the passive mode has been perfectly fine so far so it's not a big issue
- Stash space will eventually require a lot of management, having you pick and choose what to keep and what to throw away. 
- Many items cannot be sold to vendors
- You can place your camp nearly everywhere in the world, but there is often trees, rocks, and other things that block paths from letting you place what you've already created.

In fallout 4, although the dialogue is awful, the factions are interesting and you have to think about what's best for the wasteland. In fallout 76, there is some great lore, but the current factions are boring. You have to choose by the end of the game to side with raiders or settlers, and the choice is inconsequential. There is no real villain, just a skyrim rip off dragon or a vault full of robots. There is great potential with fallout 76, and it is genuinely fun, but the story is the least compelling in any game.

I can run this game smooth with a 1070 Seahawk X, and an I9, with 16 gig ram.
I'm sure this game can run on a little less then what i have I7 should be fine and a 1060 should be fine but any less then that I wouldn't even try.

I think I haven't enjoyed a game this much for a long time. It can be very relaxing to play or very challenging depending on what you want to do. It is imo what you can expect from a typical Fallout game minus some features like nonexisting slowmo VATS ( it is real-time for obviousl multiplayer reasons) but still satisfying kills and a nice tiered difficulty. It is simply fun to grind and loot while exploring the wonderfully detailed world. Under every rock, you find a little story, the environment story telling is on another level. Well done to the devs!

While the AI can bug out here and there it still behaves very well all in all and some bugs that remain are admittedly hilarious and make me want to play it even more. Nothing really new from previous Fallout games :D.

The UI I take so much issue with. It is extremely cluttered and hard to decipher and eternally infuriating. Seriously Bethesda, fix the fucking questing UI to make them distinct instead of all being the same fucking marker.

Overall, if you enjoyed FO4 even slightly, it may be worth your time to play.

Finished the main quest line and most of the endgame content after which the game came to an abrupt halt. There's not much else to do besides level up your character and get the top tier equipment that you unlock after finishing it. It's an insane grind that has no real good endgame to use it at.

Fallout 76 Wastelanders is at its' best a Co-op fallout 4. If you enjoyed the gameplay loop of 4 (explore, Kill, loot, return, craft) but wish to experience more of that with a side of co-op than this game is for you. At its' core this game is a sandbox survival with a fallout skin, some love that idea, some hate it. If you are looking for a New Vegas 2 steer clear of this game as that's not what 76 is trying to be. If you like the idea of a multiplayer survival game set in the fallout universe than this game may be of interest to you.  

One thing Bethesda managed to do right is crafting a beautiful world to fight and explore in. Despite how different this games core is to the previous titles 76 still visually looks, sounds, and feels like fallout. The world itself puts the previous entries to shame with how diverse the maps biomes are, wandering around the world of 76 can be very entertaining as you're always discovering something new. With the addition of NPCs the already impressive world feels that much more exciting to venture into especially when partied up with others. 

Though it had a comedically rough launch Wastelanders is a step in the right direction taking heavy inspiration from various elements of the older fallouts such as New Vegas. Prior to wastelanders the story was always a massive negative point for 76, it merely acted as a means to encourage exploration with little tib-bits of lore sprinkled around. Though I have not experienced too much of the new story as of writing this review the new quests and NPCs added in certainly are a vast improvement to the game, makes environments feel more lively, and have started to make this game truly feel like a proper fallout title. 

However despite the many improvements 76 is still bug ridden and struggles with optimization issues, if you are a stickler for these things this will be a very difficult game to find any enjoyment out of it. This will likely be improved over time but can still be very frustrating nontheless. 

The infamous Atomic shop is easily the worst part about the game, though there is no pay to win element in Fallout 76 the word 'microtransaction' is incredibly inaccurate. To acquire all of the items in the store you will likely need to spend well beyond 40-60 dollars which is absurd, thankfully most of the store is full of cosmetics, emotes, profile pictures, and things of the like. The currency can also be naturally earned by playing the game though it will gradually become more and more difficult as your character gets past level 50. 

I got my monies worth when I picked this game up back in November 2018, I greatly enjoyed my experiences both alone and with friends. Despite the bugs, the poor optimization issues, and previous lack of a story this game does have a sort of charm to it and can be quite exciting at times. There is nothing like roaming the lore rich world of Fallout, armed with some very interesting/wacky tools of destruction, bouncing to the beat of late 1950s era music, discovering the secrets of Appalachia, and becoming gradually more 'special' as you simply try to find your place in the apocalypse. If you are looking for another sandbox survival game, if you need a fix for your fallout addiction, if you don't mind a few bugs, and if you always wanted to play fallout 4 with others than I recommend giving it a shot. 


Edit: After playing for a while Wastelanders and its respected additions to the world add much more depth to the setting of Fallout 76 that rights the many wrongs this game initially has had since launch. The story has vastly improved, the already highly detailed world now has even more to discover, and the dialogue (though not at NVs level of depth) is far better than I was expecting and I would even argue that it rivals Fallout 4. Overall Wastelanders is a vast improvement on 76 and a step in the right direction for future updates. 


TLDR; This game isn't New Vegas 2 or Fallout 5, it's a sandbox survival spinoff that's a bit rough around the edges. But if you loved fallout 4 and want more of what that game had to offer but with a side of co-op than Fallout 76 Wastelanders is right up your alley.

97,Fallout 76,68157828,english,"Developed by Garrahan Mining Co. in collaboration with West Tek, the Excavator-class power armor was designed to protect miners from rockfalls and airborne contaminants while increasing the speed at which they could work. Despite being heavily advertised in Appalachia as the future of mining, the unit never entered full production and only five suits were known to have been made.

Created under the EX-17 Excavator Project, the armor's development was headed by Harold Frost, a service member for the United States Army Research Corps hired into the company by Vivian Garrahan in early 2075. The project made considerable progress at first, convincing Frost that he could potentially deliver a prototype within months.

The suit soon ran into durability issues, with the arm units taking extra stress when mining bedrock, causing micro-stress fractures and sheared gear assemblies. By September 2075, the research team settled on using black titanium as an alternative material, being a strong ore native to Appalachia and having the necessary tensile strength to keep the arm components from damaging themselves. Although too expensive for the T-45 power armor due to the expense of the mining process, it was considered an acceptable choice for a corporate design.

While using titanium solved the durability issues, the suit's extra weight made a more efficient reactor necessary. The team continued to experiment with new solutions as late as May 2076, but were already past specifications on the repurposed T-45 reactor, causing overheating and stability issues.

The company eventually settled on developing an ultracite reactor, having the necessary power output and radiation signature for the project. In exchange for the patented ore's usage, Garrahan Mining Co. was required to make a decade-long commitment to Atomic Mining Services. After further experimentation and a near meltdown, the team managed to power the armor with the ore. Pressured by AMS' reveal of Watoga and Hornwright Mining Co. launching the auto-miner industrial robot line, the research team was forced to work around the clock for almost a month straight. By February 2077, the team was able to complete the project and unveil the suit to the press three months ahead of schedule.

By April 3rd, three complete Excavator units were operational and proved the model to be a capable tool. A single suit operated by Bryce Garrahan was able to break the company's record for the amount of ore extracted in a single day, all without suffering maintenance issues. Much to the research team's surprise, Vivian challenged Hornwright Mining's auto-miners to a ""man versus machine"" ore-mining competition with the suits. The challenge was a calculated risk, aiming to raise the profile of the company and the project while securing lucrative contracts in the increasingly automation-oriented Appalachia. Vivian was convinced the Excavator suits distinguished themselves with revolutionary mineral sensors and the ""human drive"" to win, despite uncertainty from a majority of the company.

The event started on October 18, lasting the next 24 hours. Due to interference from Hornwright-hired mercenaries, the auto-miners won by a margin of 1.85 tons (less than a single truckload) and were declared winners by the media. Hornwright capitalized on this tenuous victory and claimed it as an example of machine's superiority to man.

Hornwright Industry's Auto-miners quickly became popular in Appalachia as the ""talk of the region."" Meanwhile, Garrahan's stock price drastically declined, allowing for a hostile takeover by Hornwright. Although Penelope Hornwright saw the Excavator armor as a ""black titanium coffin,"" the company planned to apply the suit's mineral detection technology to their own auto-miners.

The Great War ended the company's ambitions, leaving the Excavator Power Armor for various wasteland factions to recover, namely the Responders' Fire Breathers Unit and the residents of Vault 76.",1588050128,1588050128,TRUE,1,0,0.5,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,66,4,25075,5735,2632,1602038785

I love the Fallout franchise and the amazing atmosphere that comes with it. I love the wacky characters and role playing my own characters through the wastes. I love the variety of ways you can approach playing the game, be it the variety of weapons, speech checks, quest paths, or any of the more unorthodox ways of playing (fallout 1 and 2 low INT runs, etc.). However I cannot on good faith recommend Fallout 76 even with the DLC available at the time of this review. 
The feeling of fallout cannot seem to be obtained by Bethesda anymore. Perhaps it is because of the slew of bugs that most people face when running the game or the choppy frame rate but I feel those can sometimes be overlooked, see: Fallout 3 and New Vegas. The Issue I cannot get over is how pathetic everything feels. Guns are wimpy with unsatisfying gunplay, melee feels awkward and like the attacks are on rails, NPCs are unkillable and forgettable, The base building feels useless besides to build a workbench. It does not feel good writing a negative review of any game, let alone one for my favourite franchise of all time, but I cannot on good faith recommend Fallout 76 at this time of posting.",1588027593,1588027593,FALSE,2,1,0.506524265,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,338,5,323,0,294,1588029539

16,Fallout 76,68143289,english,"Before I start my review, you ought to know that I have played New Vegas and Fallout 4. 
For those of you wondering what Fallout 76 is like, think of the combat mechanics of Fallout 4 paired with the crafting and dialogue mechanics of New Vegas (hopefully that gives you a general idea of how the game feels). 
The pros of Fallout 76: Plenty of new enemies and weapons. Expanded upon skill trees. Interesting (though geographically incorrect) locations to explore. Crafting is not a hassle or tedious. The survival aspect of eating and drinking is not obnoxious. You can play with your friends (I don't know how well that works as I have yet to play with friends lol). The map is huge with plenty of places to discover. The combat is basically Fallout 4 (so I'll let you determine if that is good or bad, but I like it). The dialogue mechanics are great, and I haven't noticed issues with it yet. The building system is better than Fallout 4, but there are some issues I'll discuss later. As far as I can tell, there are no game breaking bugs. 
The cons of Fallout 76: Bugs that have been around since release are still present (I played 76 a week after it came out on my ps4 btw). There are still tons of little, annoying bugs present in the game. The scorched enemy AI is sloppy and laughable at best. The rest of the enemy AI have the same intelligence of the enemies from Fallout 4 (which I found mediocre at best). You still cannot go brahmin tipping. The economy is a bit weird to get the hang of, as caps are much harder to acquire. The building system is kind of useless (I only use it for free fast travel and an easy place to do crafting). You have to PAY CAPS to fast travel (super duper obnoxious). But the worst part of the game, without a shadow of a doubt, is that Mama Murphy is not in it. Now I have to sell my chems, or use them myself, rather than give them to a free-thinking, down to earth grandma. 
A few notes: This is as objective as I can be with this game. I have loved every Fallout game I've played. If you want to try the game, now is the best time to try it. If you want to sh*t on Bethesda, go to r/Fallout and you'll become famous for your completely new and original thinking. If you liked New Vegas AND Fallout 4 (I know that is a stretch) you should definitely give 76 a try. 
Hope this was helpful. And remember, I play certain video games because I enjoy them. It does not matter if they're ""objectively"" good or bad. The quality of a video game should be determined by the player.

20,Fallout 76,68142343,english,"Just going to quickly describe my first 24 hrs of playing this game.

-Lost all my scrap after a server update.
-Lvl 20 quest had lvl 75 enemies roaming around it so I had to get 3 friends to help me.
-Same quest line at the next objective had a few lvl 85 Legendary enemies. All four of us died over and over until we just gave up.  And before you say i'm doing an end game quest, its marked as a lvl 21 quest.
-Fast traveling stuck me under a rock and i fell to my death, lost the scrap I had on me
-Enemies are bullet sponges with lvl 5 enemies taking up to 180 damage, my lvl 20 gun only does 50 even tho its a rifle so it takes about 20 sec per enemy to kill while they consistantly shoot me through thick brush that i cant see through so i have no idea where they are, crippling every limb i have.
-Ran into TWO lvl 45 Deathclaws while doing a lvl 20 quest
-Got killed in 5 sec by a lvl 5 enemy with a minigun.  I was lvl 23

Pros
Now has NPC's....that stole my only Legendary gun i liked after I died and took all my 5.56 ammo and i cant get it back.
The shotguns feel nice, but do little damage.
I legit cant think of a Pro that also doesn't have a con attached.

Just.... stay away, the game feels like an Alpha with the constant glitches, the bad rendering and not to mention the poor optimazition that leads to enemies turning invisible because they spawned in at the same time as your view distance crossed them, to EXTREMLY high leveled enemies spawning on low level areas.",1588023914,1588023914,FALSE,3,1,0.521739125,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,181,4,3709,0,1496,1589592806
21,Fallout 76,68142085,english,"8/10
Important things to know:
-I didn't play or purchase at launch because of all The Reasons.
-I am a moderate Fallout fan, played most of them to completion except the early ones and wasn't overly hyped about this when it launched but was interested.
-I have a small idea of the issues at launch from watching streamers but am not able to speak to the improvements.  Just how a newcomer would see it.

That being said, I'm having a pretty good time!  I didn't have super high expectations and it definitely hasn't been blowing my mind but it ticks enough boxes on my list for me to consider it a pretty good game and worth checking out.

Some things i liked:
-The Community: Everyone's pretty chill and I've yet to see much PVP because it seems discouraged by the mechanics, but that's fine I'm here for the PVE.
-Graphics: It's not Metro: Exodus and it often feels like higher-res FO4, but there's some times when it WORKS.  When the lighting is just right and the shadows are coming through the Appalachian forest as you creep through a swamp stalking the Wendigo, spicy. (Speaking of which, actually has a sun that you can see travel across the sky with cool weather effects).
-Base-building: I like being able to store your base.  Seems like there's a lot of cool things you can do like create vendors to sell your stuff when you're offline, haven't explored it though.
-Gameplay: I'm actually enjoying the gunplay, and the new perk system is just interesting enough to be fun though I sense at Endgame it might have it's limitations.
-Audio: The scenic music is beautiful at times! Othertimes feels like FO4 or Skyrim riffs.
-Setting: Being from Boston and having found FO4's setting boring I thought I'd be bored to tears. But there's some really unique areas and cool biodiversity that makes a lot of it special.  Also unfortunately a lot of big open empty areas with nice scenery but not much else.  Like i said, sometimes there's moment's when I'm taken aback by how beautiful the areas are.
Quests/Monsters/NPCs: Pretty good all around though I'm told a lot of it is from Wastelanders.  Feels like most other Fallout games but with a lot more radiant quests and because the maps so big, a lot more space between them that's often empty.  Monsters are varied enough though Robots are ever present and annoying.  NPC's seem pretty cool but I don't like the over-emphasis on reading.
Things I don't like:
-The Atomic Shop. It's not as bad as people make out, similar to a lot of other games cosmetics models, but they do lock alllll the good stuff in there for building etc.  But also it's hard finding things and just browsing.  Not absolutely terrible because there's lots of ways to earn points to buy from the shop so with enough play and knowing what your dailies are you can earn a lot of the points and not spend a penny.
-The absolutely horrendous water/rain wash-out effect.  When it rains and is night, expect to see shit graphics.
-I get stuck, often.
-Lack of ways to upgrade carrying capacity and storage.  There are some, but not enough IMO.
-Lack of a chat without mods.  I mean really?
-Blueprints for building need to allow a lot more. 
-Respawns are unpredictable and often triggered by other people.

If you're still reading this i'm impressed.  Basically, it's not a bad game, it's a pretty good game in fact.  But Bethesda stepped over a line here and I hope they learned to step back.  It's not a No Man's Sky come-back story.  But I think it does speak to the devs dedication to improving it albeit while I'm sure some corporate lackey higher up the food chain is telling them to add more MT shit.  That being said, I didn't buy before because I didn't want to buy a bad product and support a bad practice.

I'm Level 30-ish and still having tons of fun with it, it somehow feels a bit better then Fallout 4 due to the fact that you actually have choices and consequences (like a real RPG should feel like), and I really like the online aspect of it now that it's a bit more fleshed out, still needs a bit more to make it feel like ""Fallout 4: but Co-op"". Although most of the time I play it alone, I think you can play it like if it was a single player game, even if there's like 20 Nukes and events going on ever 2 seconds of my life, but it's a simple leaving the world a loading up where you left off to fix it. I think the game is going in the right direction with this update and hopefully it has a the ""No Man's Sky"" symptom.

Launch day came and the vitriol and hate came pouring in for the game and I resigned myself to a very long wait for the next good installment. 

However, since the wastelanders update seems to have fixed many of my issues with the game, and most of the gameplay bugs have been ironed out, I, along with a friend (another FFF), decided to dip our toes into this 3 days ago. 

Three days and nearly 23 hours of game time later, and I do NOT regret my decision.

This game is so much fun. My friend and I keep getting distracted from any goal we set by weird and interesting side quests, and have formed Appalachia's newest and hottest jazz duo, the Wastedlanders.

The atom store is an issue that everyone sees. Along with the Fallout 1st. I understand that they need money to keep the Online aspect of the game up, but the price for everything is a little over the high there. The Fallout 1st server should have its own separate connection like the host.

The perks are a medium feeling for me. There are a lot of important perks to pick, but I keep going with weight perks, since I have a scavenger's heart. So I am unable to get any of the other perks that could've been more helpful. Which brings to weight and it is hard to never be over-encumbered.

-Once you pass the starting zone there is a ton of questing and monsters to kill
-Looting is fun and feels interesting

This was my final straw of supporting Bethesda games after putting up with day one bugs in Skyrim SE, Fallout 4 being an ok-ish game and ESO having increasingly questionable monetization practices....

However after watching a few days of this game on Twitch and seeing the better reviews, I said I'd give it a try on sale.....but then got the urge and just bought it for the regular ($55CDN) price. I figured the two hour time limit for refunds wouldn't be enough, however I didn't notice that I passed the refund window until I took a break....5 hours later. 

Is this game perfect? No. Is it better than Fallout 4? In nearly most ways so far I'd say yes. The advantages FO4 has are: offline, mods, save/reloads. Otherwise I actually enjoy the exploration and combat in this game far more.

I'm not a hardcore combat guy in Fallout games, but I will say combat here is generally quite easy. Took about 5 minutes of kiting, but I took down a level 40 robot while being at level 13 myself.

Unless you are desperate for Atom shop items, it's easy to ignore. You do earn Atoms in game, in my currently 17 hours of playtime I earned a little over 500. Seems like a lot but items are rather expensive.

A year after launch I went on the free trial and after a few days, decided it wasn't for me. My worst fears about the franchise had come to bear, it felt like a quick dash for cash by Bethesda and I understood where the negative comments were coming from. 

Now, with the launch of Wastelanders I changed my mind. It the Wastelanders have brought this up to a minimum standard which I expect from Bethesda and this it what Fallout 76 should have launched with. I've been playing this solidly for the last 2 days and while it is still buggy and lacking the polish of Fallout 4, Bethesda has somehow crossed the line after the botched launch.

EDITED:

Now that I'm almost 50 hours into the game, I have hit the stage where I cannot recommend Fallout 76 any longer. Leveling has become a tedious drag for two main reasons:

1) Scaling of enemies is terrible. You clear an area of level 20 enemies and suddenly walk into a level 68 enemy which infects you with a disease and breaks half of armor and weapons. This in turn forces you to;

2) Constantly repair weapons/armor and farm for disease cures. In order to do so, you are relentlessly hoarding junk and rushing back to your stash box to drop it off in the middle of quests. This most obnoxious thing about this is yet to come...;

3) You are limited to 800 weight in your stash box. The only way I know of increasing that is to subscribe to Fallout 1st for USD 12.99 a month. This gives you unlimited scrap storage which is basically needed if you want to enjoy higher levels and the end game.

It is now apparent to me that Fallout 76 forces you into subscribing into Fallout 1st, the game would be too tedious otherwise. I had very much wanted to like this game but cannot bring myself to play any further. I am surprised and disappointed that many game reviewers made little to no mention of Fallout 1st when reviewing Fallout 76 Wastelanders.",1587222621,1587908188,FALSE,0,0,0.495867789,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,217,6,3042,0,919,1587907535

7,Fallout 76,68054904,english,"Fallout 76 is an enigma of a game, following it's release it received severe backlash for it's unpolished nature. Alas here we are today, where FO76 has it's first expansion and is now released on Steam. Personally I wanted to purchase this game and attempt to see what mainstream media was reporting and the Steam release won me over. So right off the bat let me answer the question you are really asking, but please read the entire answer for the devil is in the details. Fallout 76 in it's current state (Base Game + Wastelands): is a great game. The sandbox creates several interesting and hilarious experiences like any other Bethesda open world game, but now there are other people to share in the fun! It's very rare that you will actually interact with strangers in FO76, although every interaction has been memorable. On the other hand FO76 is buggy and has several quirks associated with the aging Creation Engine (Which was in no way shape or form designed for MMORPGs ((I'm looking at you EA w/ Frostbite))). Personally for me this made playing this game easy because I have played Fallout 4 on PS4/PC and Skyrim on PS3/PS4/PC/VR. Making me all too familiar with this engine's quirks (Being able to fall off cliffs without damage will always be my favorite quirk). 

But seriously though, this is where Fallout 76 is at a crossroads. While it carries the Fallout name and engine that Bethesda has used for it's previous and supposedly future open world games, it's sub-genre is completely different from those previous titles. Fallout 76 should not be compared to Skyrim or Fallout 4 even though they are on the same engine. Fallout 76 needs to be compared to another Bethesda game ESO. ESO initially received similar flack from the Scrolls community due to the fact that MMORPGs tend to be more extreme/grindier version of RPGs that tend to have a 70/30 focus between gear and story. I feel a lot of Fallout fans interested in trying FO76 are deceived by the fact that the game looks and functions very similiar to FO4 (again another problem ESO had). Due to this, you need to understand that FO76 is targeted to a very sub-niche audience. You need to be a Fallout fan, you need to be a fan of the Creation Engine, and finally you need to be a fan of grindy MMOs where the reward at the end is turning the game off and realizing there is a real world outside of Appalacha. 

To truly get your moneys worth will require you to sink hundreds of hours into grinding gear, caps, and craft supplies (and TBH the game won't tell you how to grind caps, Google it). And after the 30-40 hour mark you lose the benefit of story in the grind. Part of what I am trying to convey through this review is that some games are not for you. Just like how we as humans like different foods than others. Here a good analogy: a lot of people like pizza, but there are only so many people that like pizza with pineapple (which I do!). The Fallout series is the pizza and the pineapple pizza is Fallout 76. 

Therefore if you are reading this and are asking yourself should I buy this game? You need to answer yes to ALL of these questions: Did I enjoy Skyrim and/or Fallout 4? Am I willing to put up with this aging Creation Engine? Am I a fan of MMORPGs (WoW, Runescape, ESO, etc)? Am I patient enough to invest time in an MMORPG (Fallout 76 is an MMORPG not an RPG, huge difference)? Do I understand that Bethesda Games Softworks has never made an MMO before and need time to respond to the issues the game has? Do I understand this game was built on an engine that was not initially designed for multiplayer function? Do I understand that BGS has decades of game designing experience and that I should trust that they will fix what they know is wrong? Am I willing to at some point support this game after spending the $40 to get access so that it can continue to get the support it needs?

It is still way to early to tell if FO76 is a flop or not. Take the time to really think if this is your kind of game. Unlike Skyrim or Fallout 4, FO76 requires a lot more of a commitment. It's a gamble, although if it is managed similar to how ESO currently is, I have high hopes for FO76's future.",1587903495,1587903495,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,222,1,9878,0,2117,1600754004

""But Envy"" I hear you ask. ""Why are you recommending it if your review is set to not recommended?""

The answer is simple... Fallout First. Paying for private servers. Not even the Atom shop is as egregious as I thought it was, but this shady business deal most definitely is. There is no justifiable reason for it, at all. There's a million and a half ways to circumvent forcing players to pay for their own private lobbies, yet players are being scammed by this proposal, which was launched before the wastelanders content even existed. The clear demonstration of where Bethesdas loyalties lie force me to give this game a ""No"" for others looking to get it.

Save your money, and if you're going to get it, at least get it grey market so Bethesda doesn't get a dime, or as cheap as possible on a sale of 75% or more from Steam.

With buggy T-posed enemies and an empty world devoid of NPCs, it was missing a lot of the soul of what makes Fallout interesting.

As of now in 2020 with the newest Wastelanders expansion, I decided to give it a go and start a brand new character. It now feels like the game it should have launched as. Before after leaving the vault, the starting Overseer camp was this little camp in the middle of the woods surrounded by nothing but trees. Now, it has buildings, NPCs, and points of interest to explore, but most of all the it feels more polished.

Most of all if you are looking for a new single player Fallout experience, then this now feels more possible than ever with the new quality of life improvements and addition of NPCs providing quests and story.

The discussion trees of Fallout 4 are no more and back are the discussion trees of Fallout 3. Which appear to be what fans wanted. Voice acting from the NPCs have been on par with the single player games, if not better I'd say.

And the articles online are right about the game's great community. I got to the first town and immediately a player in the area offered to help me with food and goods to survive. The PvP system feels similar to Red Dead Online's defensive mode. Meaning if a player does decide to attack you, if you don't attack back, you won't have to worry about them and they'll go away. They'll only do minuscule chip damage. Knowing this I've yet to get PvP'd by player in my original playthrough and my new playthrough on PC, but I have seen an occasional single PvP player appear on the map from time to time.

I'll certainly update my review as my experience goes on because NPCs being added is what this game direly needed to breathe this world more life.

First off if you can get lost in the mechanics of Fallout 4's grind for junk and scrap for base building and better gear then you'll love a new area to explore and you'll love the new crazy fallout quest/characters you'll run into. It took some getting used to realizing this isn't just a single player world that revolves around me and you'll quickly adapted to the new structure and move on. The craziest thing for me is how the Atomic Store isn't getting pushed down my throat or forcing me to use it to get a one up on the game and i'm surprising getting rewarded with a decent amount of Atoms (Paid Currency) just for playing the game itself, I hope this doesn't change but who knows with this format. I think i'm running a decent pc and i haven't encountered any game breaking bugs or disconnects like i did on the first couple days of launch.

51,Fallout 76,68006583,english,"I have many hours logged on the Xbox (lvl 48 for one character and lvl 29 for another and several deleted characters) but decided to pick it up on Steam so I could hang out in Appalachia with my friend who is only a PC player. Which is fine. I played somewhat sporadically before the update, mostly because there was one quest that I just could not for the life of me complete (located in a certain cave near Top of the World, hence the reason for the) which finally happened a couple days ago. Anyway, I'm mostly in it for the lore and you get a ton of it. As in, just about every location has a note or a holotape or a terminal to give some insight into pre-war life and what happened immediately after the bombs dropped and what happened about five years ago. The new enemies are fun and can also be terrifying. Again, thinking of that certain cave.
With the update known as Wastelanders, I've kind of partially fallen in love with no fewer than five of the new NPCs. They did a bang up job on the dialogue and voice acting. I wandered back into an area yesterday that I hadn't been back to in months and found a new NPC. I also particularly like that you can use Luck in some interactions and considering my lvl 48 character has kind of a scary high Luck, it can make life very entertaining.
You start off in the Vault with a grand total of 1s across the board for your S.P.E.C.I.A.L traits. Before you leave, you will make it to level 2 which means you get one (1) point to allocate to a trait. Advice from a Day 1 player? Make sure to do as many daily quests as possible. Get rid of any legendary weapons/armor with the Legendary Exchange Machine that you aren't using. Always scrap your junk and bulk the components when you can. Hoard plastic and adhesive like it is gold because you use them for nearly all of the repairs and never let black titanium pass you by. If there is an event that is technically too high a level for you but there are people already engaged in it, join anyway and try to be helpful without drawing a ton of attention to yourself. Being on a team doesn't mean you need to be in the same location all the time and you can sometimes get XP bonuses when your teammates complete quests. AND you can share some of your PERK cards with your teammates so do it. Be helpful. Because you don't have to be in the same place, there is no real downside to not being on a team. When you have too much ammunition, drop it outside 76. Keep an eye on your weapon and armor conditions.

You may notice that a lot of my advice is centered around items. That's because your stash boxes only hold a limited amount of weight which is definitely my single biggest complaint of the game. 800 is a vast improvement to the 400 we had at launch but it's still barely a scratch considering how much stuff you can collect. Coupled with that is the idea that we can't break ammunition down and that we can't sell fusion cores and mini nukes. Those suckers are heavy. If you can't figure out where your weight is, look at your ammunition.

Very long story short, I do recommend this game, just being aware that it is not perfect and it is somewhat flawed.

52,Fallout 76,68006339,english,"I, like many, was extremely vocal in my distaste for this game when it launched a year ago. I enjoyed laughing at Bethesda's many, MANY attempts to scramble some kind of fix to their broken, buggy, stumbling mess of a product and the numerous failures in PR and customer service that came as a result. I was certain that, with the Wastelanders update promising to breath new life into the game, Bethesda would find some way to mess this up too.

Thankfully, and surprisingly, I seem to have been proven wrong thus far. As it stands, the Wastelanders update really has brought some much needed life into this game's world. The NPCs are well placed and well acted (The Wayward crew and the Overseer being standout performances for me) and the storyline, as far as I have played it, has actually given me some morale choices that lead to character development.

However, it is perfectly understandable for a lot of people to still hate this game post-update. While the game itself is fairly good now, the numerous missteps from Bethesda and the way they have treated their customer base until this point has been nothing short of disgusting, and frankly, unforgivable. It's a difficult decision to balance in my head, to support the developers for sticking to their work and fixing what was originally a failed product; or to condemn the executives who decided to release the game unfinished with little more than their word promising a fix some unknown time in the future. Releasing unfinished games at full price and only fixing them down the line after you've already made money from launch sales is not a business practice I wish to support. But office floor developers working hard to turn something bad into something good because they don't want to leave us disappointed is something to be applauded.

64,Fallout 76,67990079,english,"The Wastelanders content is excellent.

Everything else is just as bad and boring as it was before Wastelanders. Expect a grindy, occasionally buggy, slog through a gorgeous wasteland that takes more than it ever gives. Balance is way off once enemies in their mid-teens and above start to appear, not to mention that enemies scale to the highest level player that has recently visited the area. This can result in enemies two to three times (or more) your level spawning all around you, effectively shutting down parts of the map that you may need to visit for quests.

I can't forget to mention the constant annoying limitations. Carry limits are the lowest of any Fallout game ever made, so you'll constantly have to trudge back to camp to dump your inventory. Your personal stash has a limit (unless you pay a monthly fee to remove it) which puts you in a ""use or lose"" situation for all your hard-won loot. Food spoils quickly (unless you use real money to buy a refrigerator), turning much needed aid into dead weight without warning. The perk card system limits your build options to whatever you get from packs plus the one card you get to choose with each level-up. It is the very worst kind of random reward and leaves you saddled with dozens of duplicate and useless cards.

It's a damn shame, really. The Wastelanders update provides a better Fallout story-telling experience than Fallout 4 did.

85,Fallout 76,67976468,english,"I really wanted to like this game, but it just falls flat.  All in all it's not a terrible game and can be rather fun, but it has several issues that just kill it for me.  

Pros:
-Huge map with lots of stuff to do.  
-More or less the standard Fallout 4 experience only bigger and better.
-Story lines that you play through are actually pretty entertaining.

Cons:
-The entire game is much darker that fallout 4 was video wise.  You can compensate for it some in the settings, but in places even in broad daylight I'm relying on my light to make stuff out.  I hardly ever even used my light in fallout 4.
-The perk system that they set up is really bad.  You get packs of cards/perks to pick from instead of the standard perk tree.  
-There are also several things that I consider necessary that they hide behind pay walls.  Your stash for example is so limited in its storage that I had it completely maxed out after 5 hours of playing.  Since you load into a new world every time you cant store stuff in other spots very easily either.  They offer larger and unlimited stash space, but of course that's extra $$$.  It's a pretty terrible cash grab in places even after you buy the game.
-The new features are not well explained at all and I felt like I was frequently stumbling into world quests and events that were well beyond my level and getting random quests that I never knew where they came from or how I got them.
-I could live with all of the above, but the one that really breaks it for me is the frequent lag.  I can't tell you how annoying it is to snipe a mutant in the head only to have him run after you for 5 seconds before the hit registers.  Throw in the mobs spawning right on top of you after you enter a zone despite slowly clearing ahead of yourself when you enter and its just headache inducing.  I think it stems from the old engine they used to build the game.  It just doesn't lend itself well to what they tried to do.  

All in all worth a play if your bored and can get it on sale, but otherwise fallout 4 was far superior.

(and bored from quarantine). Reading all the past comments and the stigma surrounding this game made me hold off. I had my doubts but this game blew my expectations out the water.

The multiplayer aspect is fine, actually I think it's pretty cool that you can run into other players and interact with. PvP is restrictive, can only pvp in certain event areas, or if BOTH players attack each other. Also the game is completely fine to solo play. The map is huge, I've read the map is about 3x bigger than FO4's map. And the content and detail in these locations are actually very good and detailed. There is a microtransaction shop but it's not in your face and not pay to win. The store only holds cosmetics and repair kits, none of which are needed at all.

Overall I'll gladly recommend this game to other Fallout fans, the quests are actually good and you can tell there was some effort put into this game. Albeit there are some bugs here and there but nothing game breaking, some optimization issues and the latency can sometimes be dogshit. 

I give this game a 8.5/10 and put consider it better than Fallout 4!

12,Fallout 76,67956592,english,"After having avoided this like the plague for the last two years due to Bethesda's half-assery, it's only fitting that I played it during an actual plague.

To be honest, it's a damn good game. I know, I'm as shocked as you are after having seen the comically awful problems it has had since launch. However, I must say I simply cannot tear myself away from it. The Wastelanders expansion has made it a full-fledged Fallout game, and one of the better ones, at least in respect to Bethesda's Fallout series. It's better than Fallout 4 and seems to actually have more in line with FO3 and even New Vegas; the dark, bleak storytelling from NV is here along with the tongue-in-cheek humor that the series has always been known for. The NPC addition to the game has changed it immensely; it's truly night and day.

I'm reticent to call it an MMO, however, and that's actually a good thing. It feels more like a hybrid of the past titles, just with multiplayer. With a maximum of 24 players on each server, it's actually interesting to run into another player and feels a bit more realistic and how it should actually work in the Fallout universe. This isn't a standard MMO with people running around spamming chat (there is no chat) and annoying you. I see Bethesda's vision with 76, and I must say it just works. It appeals to the single-player experience as well as the multiplayer. I have yet to run into a single bug, in fact, and the in-game Atom shop is not intrusive and seems to legitimately be designed for cosmetic purposes only. There is no golden ammo.

It's a damn good game, honestly, and I really hope my friends decide to take the plunge because it would be great fun to explore the wasteland with them. 

On the negative side, it is a bit of a resource hog, and although the CPU requirements are a bit exaggerated, you will need to offset a less-powerful CPU with more RAM and a decent video card. Slowdown occurs in more populated areas, but you know what? It always has because Bethesda titles are all notoriously terribly optimized, and while there have been massive improvements to the code, the FPS in the game does have occasional slowdown, although it's not game-breaking.

In short, if you're a fan of the Fallout series from Bethesda, you will enjoy it and you will not regret buying it. It's not quite as immersive as FO3 and NV, but it beats the pants off of FO4, which I enjoyed as well.

The community.

Cons
Lots of bugs. I see NPC'S frozen in place every so often
Bodies can disappear to fast
You don't feel that sense of 1 driving story

My over all opinion is bethesada seems to be giving it a better shot now. They are listing and fixing most of what people were upset about. Is it perfect? Hell no but if you like'd fallout 4 you'll love this game if you have a friend to play with. The solo isn't half bad but why buy this for solo?

 I played the beta and didn't come back till it was released here so can't really speak on the experience between those dates – but the NPC’s help a lot and glad to see them there. It does feel like a Fallout game and has a lot of potential to be much greater. 

Lastly, do yourself a favor and patch the ini files either with the program on the nexus or manually, the game actually runs around 70~80 fps on my gtx 970 i7 4970k.

As a solo player I really enjoy the details and atmosphere of RPGs and so far it's been doing a great job.  The areas are filled with unique buildings and gizmos to find.  The music without the radio on is classic Bethesda and excellent.  The little stories and tapes around are great and, with the current pandemic, really creepy.  I enjoy running into other players who so far haven't been bugging me.  We wave or jump a few times and go on our way and seeing what thy have built in their camp is always interesting.  I've only had 1, maybe 2, disconnections and little lag so that's good.
I've definitely had some issues with the game, a lot of which are ones i remember seeing from launch videos.  I've seen the frozen in place enemies and some headlessness.. but honestly it really isn't bad and my main problems with the game are control/menu related.   I gave up on using a controller after getting frustrated with enemies charging me down and me shooting the air and ground in response.  The pipboy menu system is beyond awful for a live game and I can't understand why it's there.  My least favorite part of this game is the forced survival system of eating and drinking.  Like WTF why is this here?  Oh shit, it's been 4 minutes and I now gotta navigate the pipboy to wherever the water is in the growing list of aids only to find I don't have any and now I have to go back to camp or risk searching houses around me, and with the very limited ammo it's kind of risky.  I hate it and wish it was just an option, but oh well.  
I do recommend this game though.  I think the interesting world and stories in it are great.  The NPCs so far have been entertaining and well voiced.   Once you get used to the menus and favorite system things are fairly smooth.  If you're bored and can handle some bugs here and there It's a big world with a lot to see.

55,Fallout 76,67919473,english,"First, I want to acknowledge that Bethesda really shit the bed with the launch. While I understand the negative reviews on here that have to do with that, I also think it isn't fair to be reviewing a game on Steam that has been updated several times now from what originally left a bad taste in your mouth. It's not the same game anymore, so what does your past experience matter at this point?

Obviously I never played F76 back then because it was universally dumped on, and I figured I'd stick to another runthrough of F4 (still love that game). But with the launch of F76 on Steam and its associated DLC, I figured I'd bite the bullet and see what this thing was all about. 

First, it's not quite an F4 experience; this game was clearly built with teamplay in mind. That said, it's still a pretty solid single player experience, in my opinion, but you'll need to accept a few things before you can get to it. So here goes my rundown.

1. This game is like Fallout 4 meets the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series. If you haven't played the latter, then shame on you, but if you have, then what I mean is that it brings giant areas and survival elements into the mix where they didn't necessarily live in Fallout 4/NV/3 before. You could opt for the Hardcore modes, sure, but in this game they're mandatory. Some people dislike this, but it does add another layer to the game. Additionally, you can get set up with your own little farm at your C.A.M.P (more on that in a minute) that produces food and water, so when you log in you can just throw together your food/water needs and set forth on your adventure. It's also nice having such a giant area to roll around in; it makes for some longer walks, but there's still a fair amount to see and do along the way. 

2. The game will initially feel empty. This is because there aren't any huge hubs like Megaton, New Vegas, or Diamond City, or if there are then I haven't found them at 25 hours in. This takes a little getting used to, but believe me that as you roam the West Virginian wasteland, you WILL find people, places, and questlines that are right at home in the Fallout series. Don't let this put you off -- again, you'll get used to the size of the map. Additionally, quests come from all over the place. I randomly picked up a note from a kitchen counter and it became a quest to pick up supplies from a US Govt automated drop site. I encountered a radio station broadcast by an AI that thinks it is the Mayor of a ghost town who wanted me to get the water park, hunting lodge, and shooting club range ready for tourist season. Additionally, there are daily quests, regional events, and so on. Again, it starts empty, but you'll find it fleshes itself out at a steady clip.

3. C.A.M.P. So F4 had settlements that we needed to refurbish, but F76 has the CAMP. It's a silly acronym that basically amounts to building one settlement: yours. Where? Just about wherever you want. I'd recommend reading up on it for yourself if you really want to know more, but basically you can build a cabin or a mansion for yourself and either have it exist in perpetuity in one location or you can scoot it around the wasteland. I didn't like the settlement building in F4 myself -- it became extremely tedious over time to me -- but I did like building things for myself. Perfect match, in my opinion.

4. Combat has its ups and downs. I find that most humanoid enemies rate from standard Fallout fare to goofy (strafe a bit, stand still behind no cover, shoot at you once, pause, shoot again, strafe, repeat). It varies, though I don't know why. The monster enemies, though, can be rough. Strong melee hits will send you reeling and throw our aim all over the place (as they would when coming from a Yao Guai) and animals can be relentless in this regard. Additionally, there's a host of new mutant creatures in F76 that can be pretty mean. Scorchbeasts are the first flying monster I recall -- and I mean flying, not hovering like Bloodbugs or Stingwings. They will launch into the air and rain death upon you like a bat/dragon hybrid. Pretty brutal.

5. The Perk system. So the Perk system got an update; you don't flesh out your character's starting stats and go from there anymore. Each attribute (Strength, Perception, etc.) starts with 1 point. Every level, you can assign another point to one attribute. Yes, this means that at, say, level 300 (which is attainable, btw), you'll have 299 points spread however you like across each attribute. As you gain levels, you get Perk Cards. These cards assign a bonus much like those you chose in F4 and NV. Each card has an associated point cost, which you meet in order to ""equip"" the card. So let's say you have 5 points into Strength. This means you can equip one 3-point card, and two one-point cards. The 3-point card might make all Junk items weigh 75% less. The one-point cards might each improve your one-handed weapon damage and improve your shotgun handling, respectively. Think of the points as a resource cache and the cards as a draw on those resources. It's a little odd at first, but I've found it makes for a pretty flexible character: you can build in the cards you want and leave out the others. This is nice after F4, which required you to dump 10 points into Strength just to get the Pain Train perk even if you didn't care about any of the other perks before it. 

6. If you've read this far, you're clearly interested, but I really won't say much more. Is it an F3/NV/4 experience? Not precisely; I'd say it's about 76% there (lol, but seriously). It's a new idea for Bethesda that they, initially, handled really poorly, but it's gotten better (as far as I can tell). I would recommend reading up a bit on the CAMP, how power armor is handled, how teamplay works, and maybe watch some gameplay videos if you are really on the fence. Otherwise, go for it.

You will constantly find yourself stuck when in a bunker and unable to even walk around, sometimes you can not open your pipboy, respawning more often than not does not work which leads you to restart your game and truly lose all your dropped gear. The game has a super small Camp size and a very low budget, the Fallout 1st is straight up a pay to win, some would argue against it but it pretty much gives you a portable scrap box base along with an unlimited storage in junk. The game has a low storage capacity, 800 pounds, which seems like a lot until you realize things such as ammo even has weight. There is a 'scrip' limit (scrip is the currency for trading in legendary gear) which is what causes your storage to be filled with legendary gear so you don't waste that potential scrip. Fallout 1st private servers are a joke. You can explore on your own. That's the only good part. You can take over additional workshops to gain resources but logging out of the private world and back into a normal world deletes the private server's workshop even if you hop back in private, which means you waste all your time and materials setting them up. Private servers do not increase camp budget or camp size. The game has been out for a few years and it is still terribly optimized (running a 2080ti along with a i9-9900k) and I often get 30 frames when near player made camps. You have a radius for each camp and can not build anywhere close to another person's camp to simulate making a larger camp. The base building is incredibly wonky at best.

74,Fallout 76,67907245,english,"I wanted to like Fallout 76 as I was a huge fan of Fallout 3, New Vegas, and Fallout 4.  I followed along with rumors and news stories about 76 development.  I waited patiently for it to arrive.  I pre-ordered it for Xbox and downloaded it at Midnight on release day.  I played it the whole next day.  The game was playable for me at launch, but it was pretty buggy.  Around Christmas of 2018, I played my last game and was kicked offline for a few days.  So, I didn't try playing again until July of 2019.

My problem with the release game was that it seems like you arrived in-game after all the excitement.  There was nothing real to do other than avoid getting killed by the fellow players and running into high-level monsters that could kill you with one touch.  To me, it was a half-finished game that should not have been released.

I wasn't alone in that thought as the game received near-universal critical complaints about the poor state of what shipped.  When you plunk out $100 for a AAA title, you expect a finished product.  That wasn't Fallout 76.

So I stopped playing the game for almost a full year past its release only to find nothing had really changed in the game.  

Wastelander dropped and I decided to give it a try.  I bought my Steam copy and began playing.

The game is massively better, but still suffers from the buggy problems that plagued it on release.  I would even go as far as saying the game is actually playable.  But my complaint still remains - this is not a finished product nearly a year and a half after launch.  What I find truly reprehensible is charging a $100/year subscription to play on a private server.

I want offline and LAN only versions.  I don't need a server to run this game as was proven by Fallout 4.

All I want from Bethesda is matchmaking to let me find my friends so we can host our own private server.  I don't care about the daily event crap.  I just want to play the game without Bethesda screwing it up any further.  I've already plunked out money for a finished game.  Give me what I wanted.

Now that said, The gaming community in Fallout 76 are some of the most polite and helpful players.  I've been playing online since the mid-90s and am pleased by how mature and respectful most players I've run into have been.  You still get high-level players lending you a hand and that says alot about them.

I do recommend this game because of the improvements made.  But I would suggest you be aware of the server problems and constant meddling Bethesda does with this game.  I expect better than what I've gotten.  I pray Bethesda can give us better.

If the game was made on the basis of being more action packed and less scavenge heavy, then maybe I could dig it. but I just can't get into this game like I could Fallout 3 or Fallout 4.

78,Fallout 76,67904834,english,"FO76 has changed immensely since it's original disastrous release. Now new NPCs have been added to both the wastlanders DLC, and the vanilla story. Effectively making this 2 games wrapped into one. It feels like a fully fledged out fallout MMO sandbox now which I have to say is really fun. The CAMP system is really fledged out and I've been having loads of fun building and decorating my house, its fun to meet new people and do flash quests or raids with them and to all the loners out there, there is easily 100+ hours of story content to enjoy. All of which can be played solo. You get the vanilla game with new NPCs and I must say a comparatively open ended and much more interesting story than what was provided with FO4, plus you get the wastlanders storyline which is by far the best part of the game. Its 8-12 hours (dep on if you've already beat 76's story or if your new) and is really open ended allowing you to side with whatever faction you want and play through the storyline however you want much like new vegas. Not to mention 95% of bugs destroying this game at launch and the year following have been patched, so rest assured there is no horrible bugs to impede your progress. 

Overall I have been very much enjoying the game so far and would def recommend it to any Fallout fans who have been on the fence.

-forced to go on servers with other people unless you pay a monthly fee for private servers, which does impact gameplay as if a high level goes to an area shortly before you do you will face enemies WILDLY outside your ability to handle and promptly die, often having to figure out how to deal with said enemies to retrieve loot youve dropped from dieing (chaining mines helps with this admittedly, if the area you're in permits the trick.
-buggy enemies. oh boy where to begin.. pathing i guess? enemies will randomly sprint 3-4x faster than they should at random times, making them much harder to hit.

99,Fallout 76,67893560,english,"As a disclaimer, I didn't play this game before Wastelanders. But if you're buying this now then that's not a concern for you.

As it is now, the game is good. It is indeed a different Fallout experience but I feel that it does fit the experience well enough. From what I've been seeing the map/environments are some of the best that Fallout has had so far. The main questline has easily the best story in all of Fallout. Yes even New Vegas. Its mostly told through journals and audiologs but hot damn does it land well, and those Voice Actors act their hearts out. The story could have perhaps been presented a bit better, but I like what we got. The whole thing about slowly piecing together a story after everyone is gone works out pretty well even though it is a departure from standard Fallout.

Gameplay is good, though this is the part that's only ""fine"". Weapons are leveled so you'll need to find/make new weapons every several levels, and the mods cannot be taken off so there is a real push to scavenge as much as you can. Which can be at odds with there being a hard limit on what you can store in your stash. However, once things click and you fall into the groove of the game it all starts working. You start building up your C.A.M.P. and armor and weapons with all that scrap, you sell shit you don't need and it all starts working out pretty well.

I'm about 35 hours in as of writing this, and I feel I've gotten my money's worth already. I'm nowhere close to being done exploring the map/doing quests so I'm not going to run out of things to do for a long time. The online component feels relatively unintrusive and I just don't have any major complaints against it. And somehow, against all odds, I've been having a shockingly bug free experience. They did some behind the scenes things like not letting you have manipulation over items/bodies and dropped items going into little paper bags, but the crazy bastards actually did it.

20,Fallout 76,67878983,english,"I'm going to have to go against the 2020 opinion of this game and Steam's ""mostly positive"" review and pretty much call this game out for what it is, and to start off this review, I'll refer to a comment I just made on a youtube video I just watched by SkillUp.

""I feel Covid-19 saves this game for me specifically, because I would never make time for this game like I'm doing right now under normal circumstances, the quality is still just not there. But with this social isolation and lockdown,  I can enjoy the hours and hours of pointless stupidity of Fallout 76, even though I feel the only reason is for the addiction that is the camp building, looting, survival gameplay loop. Like Fallout 4, my camps have become purified water manufacturing camps that solve all my survival needs, so much so that sometimes I'm just dumping purified water and other supplies for the new players just to help them get by. This experience is also heightened since during the beta, my file from the account I got the game refunded during the beta is still there and I was on level 15 anyways, and I had a skeleton mask, but with the vending machines I can finally fulfill my dream of becoming a Dark Souls like skeleton merchant, which is truly all Fallout 76 ever needed... Also, if you've read this far and are wondering, I believe the pandemic and lockdown is driving me mad.""

All jokes aside, I feel unless you're a huge Fallout 4 fan, or if this lockdown has has taking some of your reasoning resources away, you're probably best just finding better games to play if you're the average gamer.  Fallout 76 is still just a completely broken and stupidly monitized addicting gameplay loop that hasn't earned the praise it's getting today. The atom shop for me will only exist to justify the random ass atom grind I receive while I hopelessly deal with the camp building / looting addiction I've gotten myself into... 

So as for this game, yeah, I hate to say it, but that's it right there. This is the reality of this game. For those who are interested in the Wastelanders update, there is certainly value in it and it is the step in the right direction, but for the average gamer, you're better off just taking it as a mental note and say to yourself ""Hey, this is a sign Bethesda games could get better"".

But not Fallout 76, this game was dead on arrival, and even as of today, only exists to appeal to a certain niche group of fans, and if you are one of those fans, I feel that is fine. I myself do enjoy that gameplay loop and will continue my skeleton merchant shenanigans... Speaking of which, that's what I'm going to do right now. Play more Fallout 76!

But yeah, don't buy this game if you're expecting it to be anything but Fallout 76, and stop listening to people  promoting this game as something that it isn't. It's still Fallout 76 no matter what way you want to dress it up.",1587653507,1587653507,FALSE,5,0,0.427700371,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,255,51,17205,0,3919,1596157701

I know I haven't played this as much as some of you, but this is my story.

I basically was living in a dream state of being in a coma.
I felt my life was content, when I was with my ex. We grew strong together, we became an unstoppable gaming force.
We played, elder scrolls online. Together, we became legendary. 

Then on one gloomy night, the rain pouring from the gutters. I hear every splash of water upon the concrete outside of my window. She looks me dead in the eyes and says ""You're not good enough for me."" 
I can't even utter any words of repentance. I surely thought she still liked me, but maybe she disliked that our internet was slow. I mean it would buffer while watching netflix sometimes. But as my mind cleared she was gone.. I must had zoned out. I instantly call my internet provider to increase my internet speeds. ""YES I WILL TAKE GIGABLAST INTERNET!"" I shout. It's only twice as much as I was paying, but 5 times as fast! Surely she will love me again.

WRONG!! 

It wasn't the internet speed, turns out it was my feet. See when I don't wear socks, my feet really start to smell horrid. Imagine a rotting fish stuffed full of two month old chicken alfredo (Not from olive garden). and multiply the stench of that times 4. And that's what my feet smell like, with just THIRTY minutes of not wearing socks. 

I was lost in despair. Not idea how to repair myself, my life or my smelly feet. I seeked a game to just ease my mind..
I found this gem. I sat down, prepared a glass of water and a plate of chicken nuggets (Tyson brand). I ate a couple chicken nuggets dipped into honey bbq sauce and I opened the game on my PC.

It loads. WOW!! 

I then shut down my PC, walk outside and the world has color again. It helped me realize how much beauty there truly is in this world.

Also 90% of the loot is either garbage or its 10 or 20 levels above me. To summerize: Insanely difficult enemies, Useless loot, Fetch quests, low supplies, and swarms of enemies.

78,Fallout 76,67841391,english,"GAMEPLAY

The gameplay of Fallout 76 is a sort of double-edged sword. There are intense moments, both on the settler's and raider' side, keeping you at the edge of your seat, staring at your health bar, hoping it won't disappear. However, there is the time between said moments, where you try to track the quest(or in the quest's case, run away from the player). These can be a bit repetive. What often happens, especially with the main quest, is that you don't even see the quest until it is stage two or three. For me, this gameplay is fine, but for more ""impatient"" players this may turn them away from the game a bit.

VISUALS

Running on the Creation engine, the visuals in this game are naturally very good. The colors pop out and the different environments in the maps are rendered very well.

MAPS

The map variety in this game is stellar, ranging from geothermically active areas, to decimated wastelands, and each map section has its own set of effects. The developers also stated that they will be releasing DLC maps for free, only charging for new player skins and repair kits.

VERDICT

All in all, I think this game is fresh, and a welcome reprieve from the monotony that is the modern first person shooter industry. The closest comparison that I can draw to this game is Fallout 4, having some similar mechanics.

17,Fallout 76,67405163,english,"Below are my impressions over time as I played the game and my original review. But I'm adding a second review for each element in a more standard format on the back end.
Having not really played any of the fallout games other than the old interplay ones.  I have to say I really like this game. It feels like you are exploring this big open world and building and scavenging to survive.  You constantly get irradiated so you have to deal with that which is pretty easy if you are compulsively looting everything to survive.  Then you build your own homebase and power it and its pretty cool.  It feels like a single player game for all of the time I've spent and occassionally you see others running around doing who knows what.  There are holotapes and npcs and quest to do.  On another note, about the microtransactions at least from what I played, it seems like it would take about 5-6 days of doing dailies seems to be enough to buy an item in the store and they are easy to do like gathering wood or using the workbench, doing events, and so on. It doesn't appear to be very prohibitive if you are dabbling a few hours or so each day. 
At 12 hours, I'm still loving it.  Even more I think as I'm starting to get cooler weapons and building up an array of mods and perks to help with combat, looting, and crafting.  I took control of a workshop and got a crazy amount of resources by building a bunch of generators with free resources. I also love the leveling system.  It allows you to have so much flexibility being able to move perk cards around.  I found it to be extremely enjoyable so that your stats define you and you also can adjust on the fly for various needs to stretch them further.  I personally like to play charisma so I can share a perk card with other players to make them better and its just insane how it works out.  I really am loving this game.  


Presentation
I find the graphics to be fairly good looking.  The game is post nuclear fallout so almost everything looks like trash. I still get excited seeing cool power armor and seeing cool weapons and environments. I know nothing about real life weapons so to me the weapons fire sounds great and hearing ghouls and stuff around puts me on edge.  There are a few rough edges regarding the scorched animations if killed while standing up as I've seen them freeze in frame which is annoying but not gamebreaking.  I've also noticed a few bugs regarding some perk cards where they take the incorrect number of points for the level or do not properly work but do in another tier(usually in the middle tiers) which could be game breaking and I'm surprised hasn't been patched.
Story
I'm a sucker for the original fallout story and the satires on society and everything and I gotta say, I'm a sucker here too.  Not just the ""told"" story, there is that here as well but the fact that you read a computer and see evidence of a world that has decayed and a generation before you.  People reference that you are late to the party to leave the vault which is pretty funny I think.  But there are NPC's now and they absolutely help the game.  I did also like that the nukacola plant has nuclear waste everywhere which makes you think they use that as an ingredient in it, which I found pretty funny and nice touch.  As far as I could tell there was no reference other than the scrap you find in the area. I think Bethesda did a better job than fallout 4 in doing the satire properly.  It feels like a proper single player game, not an MMO with carry this here and do that.  It was a big departure from any MMO I have ever seen in that regard.
Atom Shop and Fallout 1st Subscription
So, you definitely get way cooler stuff spending money in the cash shop.  For a game that feels mostly singleplayer it feels like a total cash grab and is disappointing.  I did spend a bit of money eventually to get a few things.  At this point, both robots and some house decoration items.  You can place those at the open world workshops as well so you could potentially gain quite a few tangible benefits from the robots.  Fallout 1st offers a few tangible benefits, the most important to me was the survival tent, you can place it on the map and its a second fast travel point you can move for free aside from your camp.  If you are in a team, this allows them to travel to it as well.  I don't feel this is game breaking but it definitely is a significant quality of life improvement.  The same goes for junk stash.  Even before I paid, I had no problem as I managed my storage.  The junk status has a scrap and store button.  I take the perk pack rat and this makes it barely even noticeable to pick up junk.  You need to manage your inventory whether you have fallout first or not.
Build Variety
The special system and the flexibility of the perk cards are amazing to me for an MMO.  You define your character with special attributes and you cannot spec into everything.  Then you have perk cards which you get in decks which you can apply to each attribute up to the cap.  Each attribute also has passive benefits as well. As such, you can have a highly unique character and effective character by playing with it some.  For instance, I originally didn't want to use vats but after playing around with it some, I was able to really wreck house with it and it definitely made me rethink what I was doing.
Gameplay
This is the real thing for me.  I mean it feels like a single player game but with multiplayer.  You can play as a stealth bowman/sniper and play like Farcry, or run in power armor smashing people with a sledgehammer.  You can hack robots, you can pick locks, you can charm people.  You can use vats to maximize your ammo by doing spike damage through crits.  You can drop a nuke on other players, you can participate in events to capture workshops.  I loved every moment of playing so far and will play significantly more as I have less than 1 quarter of the map comlpeted.
Crafting
Another highly rewarding thing for me.  You build up your C.A.M.P. and can build resource extractors, plant crops, crafting stations a bed.  I originally did this for pure utility but as time went on, I started crafting more of an actual home looking thing and that made it far more enjoyable for me.  A few points in intelligence will make the cost of this almost non-existent.
Overall
This game was pretty much perfect for me.  Nearly everything I liked was not there on release so I can really understand why people didn't like it initially but it really is an amazing game now.",1587004013,1587558449,TRUE,3,1,0.511571229,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,1426,102,9603,0,309,1590831949
18,Fallout 76,67813867,english,"i have quite a bit to say. i've never had a game surprise me like this, and I ask you to actually read my review before downvoting and giving a ""haha"", maybe putting down a comment about giving in to Todd's sweet little lies.

i have never had a game where, while playing, 10 different people DM'd me asking ""wow, really? you're playing that?"" or ""is it any better?"" or ""lol todd scammed you"". that being said, I think the public hysteria regarding this game is laughable at best, and a lot of people are cheating themselves out of a pretty decent experience, for a fraction of a price of a full fallout game. you might say that it's been out a while, but really a lot of people consider wastelanders, and this game's simultaneous steam integration, it's full, 1.00, release.

so, when this game came out, i didn't have access to video games. that being said, when I got back, i found out that this was bethesda.net only, and I read some of the features, and decided that it wasn't worth it to buy, or even to leave steam. seeing it pop up here though, I decided to try it, and utilize steam refunds, if need be. something to keep in mind from this review is that I did not play it pre-wastelanders, i have only played on steam.

 I have been playing (bethesda) fallout for about 11 years now, and I have been disappointed with everything post FO:NV. that being said, only playing it on it's steam release, I think it's a pretty okay game, easily beats fallout 4 in terms of things to do and content. the scope of the map is unbelievably big, theres two different main quests, the new expansion is free, the paid stuff is earn-able in-game and is updated weekly, there are several different grinds, and a post game that basically ends when you want it to. So that's three forms of currency, classic caps, atoms--the earnable, premium currency--, and gold, the new currency that's great for getting items that are too expensive to buy with caps. i'm sure they do more, but I haven't even reached level 100 yet, so don't take my word on those.

 the cons are obviously that it's always online, and that there's PVP. PVP is just not fallout, it's goofy, its about as functional as borderlands PVP. that being said, it's a pretty great community of people, 95% want to help you out, and those that don't, you can just leave and find a new server in seconds. 

as far as recommendations for improvement, we still need a solo mode, private servers should not be locked behind a sub, i'd like to see Raids return soon, since all steam users missed out on them. I'd love more music for the radio station, maybe a capital wasteland expansion.

Other than that, the hate on this game, post wastelanders update, is mostly unbased and hypocritical from fans of fallout 4, one of the most lacking games that bethesda has made, with some of the most laughably bad DLC they have ever produced. Wastelanders is better than anything fallout 4 had to offer. a dialogue system that isnt garbage, and pretty funny speech options, varied locations/biomes, and a sense of exploration that I didn't get from fallout 4's cramped play area. 

The bad things are pretty varied, and can decided whether or not you will play. you can not save, you cannot play offline, crafting is a pretty big part of this game. when you kill enemies, you aren't able to take their equipment. this may sound strange, but when you see how the game actually works, this makes more sense later. any other cons could be applied to literally any other bethsoft game. glitches, occasional graphical weirdness, etc. 

If you can trudge through all that, I think this game is seriously fun. What sealed the deal for me was playing with my friends, who i've shared fallout stories and instances with, for years. it's so strange to walk through the wasteland with friends, completing quests, doing events, helping each other with tough enemies, and hopefully, soon, raids. (apparently they were in the game, but were removed when wastelanders released, likely to integrate the raids into the game more naturally). the progression is mostly smooth, there's always a reason to explore the odd town or gas station, tons of added lore, not to mention the fact that the game takes place very shortly after the Great War. (around 200 years before FO3). 

If you're a fallout fan, i think this is a must buy. I think it's better than fallout 4 easily, mostly because fallout 4 lacked in a ton of aspects, and it didn't have any form of coop, tons of cut content, and just a lackluster map in general, with not much variety. This game offers coop, actual fun base building, the biggest map in fallout history, not to mention more post game content than we've ever seen. It's also worth noting that it's (free) expansion wastelanders is better than every fallout 4 DLC combined, not that that's saying much. 

Currently i've finished both main questlines, all the sidequests, and i'm trying to put a jetpack on my X-01 armor, which takes a lot more effort and determination to do then it did in FO4.  

As far as my personal experience, if that's what you're reading for, i've been having a blast, and especially with this COVID thing going on, i've been addicted. I get the fallout 3-NV feeling of going to search every building with no reason to, only to be given a reason by the game, or even rewarded with XP/Caps/Quests. I love the progression from lowly dweller to power armor laden chad, with skill cards making the power cores no longer an issue, and the whole world is just beautiful. except for cranberry bog. don't go there.

also, before i get hate for putting down fallout 4, I mainly bring it up to parallel it to this game, and the dumb complaints I hear from people. I saw one review that said ""i can't believe the guys that made fallout 4 made this"". Really? you think fallout 4 was that good? I can understand people being upset that a 12 year old game like FO3 trumps any modern bethsoft game, but the comparisons praising fallout 4 are hilarious. It came slowly, but it became blatantly clear to me that this game, vanilla, no mods, crushes fallout 4. the achilles heal is obviously the always online. If bethesda found a way to remove this, maybe add another expansion, we would have a very solid entry. for now, it's a game I think is worth playing, and has a lot to offer. Bethesda really seems to be trying to get in our good graces. You can likely figure out if this game is worth it in the first two hours.

basically, the game was bad, now it's decent, good for bethesda standards. try it out, if you don't like it in less than two hours, you know what to do.",1587557880,1587558039,TRUE,0,0,0.454545468,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,1334,96,22527,3535,5825,1602006981

21,Fallout 76,67808874,english,"Okay... So this game is great (for the 30 minutes I played), but I want to write a review based on system requirements specifically due to my experience. !!!! PLEASE READ IF YOU DO NOT HAVE A SUPER DUPER COMPUTER !!!!

My rig is actually capable of running the game on Ultra - EXCEPT when it comes to my CPU. Here, I am lagging a little behind (8 years, in fact).

I have a GA-78LMT-USB3-R2 motherboard, with an AMD FX-6300 CPU. Now this motherboard has a socket type of AM3+ for CPU's, which unfortunately limits me to ""old gen"" CPUs. Specifically, the AMD FX-8750 is the best I can get, and it's barely an upgrade. This series severely lacks in single processing power, and this game apparently requires a lot of that.

As a result, despite the game running at 60 FPS on ultra on average, every second it hitched/stuttered for a second. Even putting literally every setting to the lowest in the INI file, it still hitched!

And so, after hours of Googling with a friend to fix my issue, and trying everything under the Appalachian sun, we found that the answer was unfortunately that my CPU just isn't capable of running the game.

I've been considering upgrading my rig for quite some time for upcoming games, so I splashed out a bit on an MSI b450 Mortar MAX motherboard, and an AMD Ryzen 5 3600 CPU (and some new DDR4 memory as a result of the upgraded motherboard - But that's by the by).

I had to research for quite a while, though, because apparently the Ryzen series had incompatibility issues with the b450 motherboards due to an older BIOS - I did find out that the MSI MAX motherboards are specifically an upgraded version of a counterpart which comes pre-installed with an updated BIOS to work with the 1st, 2nd and 3rd gen Ryzen CPU's. So if you too go down this road, then do make note of that!

So yes, please do be warned, if you have an older CPU (GPU is less of an issue) then you may be unable to play this game comfortably, regardless of settings. Specifically for AMD; the FX, Phenom, Athlon, and Sempron series are likely going to cause you massive issues.",1587551273,1587551919,TRUE,0,0,0.47371161,1,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,241,48,10462,0,101,1591878439

39,Fallout 76,67798919,english,"I ignored the game until now due to the many issues it had. While it still has some issues and I am not a fan of the microtransactions, the positives clearly outweigh the cons for me. The fact that the game now supports ultrawide resolution, was the final argument that swayed me to pull the trigger now. 

The world is huge and a joy to explore (50h in, have not seen half of the map). It is not only huge in size but it is filled with many interesting things. With the update it now also has human NPCs, which make the world come alive much more, even some old quests have been updated.

I can see that measured against traditional single player RPGs and its predecessors why some might not like this game. And the mess at launch, caused by Bethesda, didn't help either. But with the latest update if I compare it to previous MMOs I played, this game comes out on top. The quests are much more enjoyable and the events are also very unique each one and fun. You can pretty much ignore other players if you want to and don't be bothered, or just join them on events or check out the cool CAMPS some players built.

What bugs me the most in the game is the inventory management. That was a component that annoyed me in Fallout 4 already, but here it is more extreme. I feel I spend a good chunk of my time managing my stuff and repairing items etc. instead of exploring the world. But exploring the world and building your house is such a joy that this didn't put me off and I must admit I did pay for Fallout First now, to get rid of some of the inventory management. 

Overall I recommend to give it a try to anyone who likes story and exploration focused MMOs or RPGs. I think Bethesda is going in the right direction with this. I just hope they are careful with the monetization approach.

59,Fallout 76,67790875,english,"Proud player of Fallout 4 (nobody owns this stuff anymore) and was expecting great things from Fallout 76. Unfortunately it doesn't measure up to expectations. My machine handles the game well and I have no technical issues, other than the apparently intentionally programmed inability to save the game when I want to. If one considers the ability to save a game to be a basic function of a good computer game and the programmers don't program it so you can do this easily, then this game isn't really a game, it is something you do until you get bored. Another feature of a good game is the ability to not just play but to be able to improve your character and his/her environment in a manner that suited your style of play. Fallout 4 did this pretty well and one of the best features there was the way you could take over and develop workshops into mini villages. This game has that - until you log off then all that you have done disappears and you are free to start over again, depending of course on where the game decides to let you respawn. The AI is also weak and does not appear to be a significant improvement over Fallout 4 when it comes to the way ""garrisoned"" characters respond to being shot at. Kill a gun turret from a distance and nobody cares. Kill an NPC manning an observation post or tower, no reaction other than the NPC is dead. No alarm, sirens, activity or obvious attempts to hide or find the shooter. Gee even the ancients in Skyrim respond with alarm when one of their own gets arrow-sniped from a distance. There also seems to be a lot less ammo laying around, which could be seen as positive, but since this game pretty much revolves around you killing everything that moves (with some exceptions), that makes it difficult sometimes. But that's what games are supposed to be, challenging, right?. You can also carry a whole lot more junk (literally) and still move easily with an AP reduction, as you look for a place to drop that stuff. Basically you are an armed junk collector, constantly working to improve your ability to collect junk without getting killed. That being said what I really miss is the ability to manage the small communities, build, and create trade and commerce. Maybe you have to buy a subscription to do this (not me buddy, the price is high enough already) or reach a level well beyond the one I will ever reach in this game. In light of what Fallout 4 and the add-ons was and what Fallout 76 could have been, on a scale of A - E, with E being for Effort, I have to give them an E and cannot recommend this game. They clearly put very limited effort into this hoping to make significant bucks on all of the add-ons, subscriptions and other pay-for-it-or-die-a-lot features. Another great gaming concept falls into the pile of marketing guano that makes it a stinking loser. These are our times.

61,Fallout 76,67789942,english,"Fallout 76 was a massive disappointment when it first came out. After 2 years of being released and finally adding NPC's, I decided to give the game a try, being a massive Fallout franchise fan. I must say after all this time I did have high expectations. Turns out I was more than disappointed about this game. Should you get it for 10$, yeah. $50? Absolutely not! Here are my reasons why;

- Firstly Fallout 76 brings a unique feature called C.A.M.P s. Allowing you to build a base anywhere on the map. The thing is, it's so unreliable its frustrating. When I built my first camp, I made sure the ground was flat, but I couldn't place foundations because ""an object intersects"" which obviously nothing did. Secondly, blueprinted my base only to find out it was deleted and divided into 30 segments. Great, I'm playing a puzzle game now. So I gave up on camps and just started using the normal workbenches at vendors.

- Ok, so whatever if camps don't work, right? Well the fighting in this game is terrible. Enemies spawning in front of you (literally), or despawning just as you are to kill them. Awesome! Did I also mention the awful V.A.T.S system? With no ""slow-mo"", it's a big... meh...

- So uh... where are the quest lines? After getting to level 20, exploring most of the map, I can say most of the quests are ""Explore this place"" or ""Clear this workshop"". I guess they tried to save it with events, but they aren't even better, they feel like a filler to something missing. 

- Would you look at that, a black screen! You read that right, Fallout 76 is full of game breaking bugs, for example, shooting a ghoul just to find your screen slowly going dark, but still being able to use and see the pipe-boy, shoot, or die. You'd expect these things to be fixed, like seriously. 

All in all had so much potential, but after all this time it's been released and still has these game breaking bugs, seeing what they have ""fixed"" I don't see much more potential for this game... They are trying so hard to fix it, and doing a good job at it, but adding what was expected at release 2 years later to a game that is this unstable. It's just not enough to consider it a genuinely good game. Sorry but that's a big no no to me, hence the negative review.

21,Fallout 76,67743399,english,"Bottom line:  I feel like I can finally call 76 ""a Fallout game"".

I would describe Fallout 76 right now as a ""Fallout 4 Survival mode Lite with coop"" and with Fallout 3/NV dialogue options. 

Since Wastelanders, it's pretty much Fallout 4 Lite with a dash or two of Fallout New Vegas mixed in.  It looks and plays nearly identical to FO4 Survival Mode, except with extremely pared-down survival and settlement-building systems, coop, optional PvP, Fallout 3/NV-esque dialogue options, and VATS is now real-time (essentially an aim assist, but I actually really like it better this way).

The multiplayer aspect of this is kind of exaggerated I think, if you want to play this as a single player game you can.  The map is HUGE, and even when you do see another player, most of the time they just do their own thing like you're not even there.  

I've played this entirely so far as a single-player Fallout game and can count on one hand the number of times another player made any attempt to get my attention, and half the time they just waved hello and went on their merry way.

General Rating:
★★★★☆

After a long and bumpy road filled with more bugs than a Radroach nest I can honestly say that Fallout 76 has developed so much and is a much better game than it once was. Anyone who has friends that previously played Fallout 76 has most likely heard the horror stories of launch. The unusual broken promises (and fans hearts). 

From the 50 hours I've played at the time of writing this since the Wastelanders update I can say with the upmost certainty that the wasteland has changed! (And for once its for the better.) This is an upward momentum I hope Bethesda keeps up in future updates. I definitely recommend giving it a play. It's fun to play and in my personal opinion has a main story more interesting than the prior game Fallout 4. A world lore that I personally find to be absolutely fascinating. At the end of the day Fallout 76 finally has something for everyone.

That being said. There are still some problems. I've only experienced minor bugs so far such as enemies just staring at me refraining from killing me. (I just think its my winner personality). There has also been a recent shut down of player trading due to a duplication exploit I believe. Which says more about some of the player bases tenacity to always find new ways to dupe their loot than Bethesda's ability to prevent them. Finally communication. You can voice chat, You can emote. But you can't text chat. Not something that bothers me too much but I can definitely see it impacting other players gameplay

Enjoyment:
★★★★☆
From nuking an NPC camp for having high prices to being killed by a particularly aggressive Assaultron. I have enjoyed every second of it.

Lore (Whether its canon or not):
★★★★★
A story with depth and a boatload of text/ voice log lore backing it up

Bugs:
★★★☆☆
-They are still there but they are features!

Accessibility:
★★★★☆
-A game great for fans of the franchise and newbies. Honestly might be one of the most accessible games in the franchise for people who have never heard of Fallout.

Service Support:
N/A
-I personally cannot offer my opinion on this subject as I have not needed to report any major issues or contact support. (Which I consider a plus!) However the fact that the player trading system has been taken down shows that they're trying to prevent exploits, however such a drastic measure being required to solve the issue is a little disappointing.",1587384470,1587426806,TRUE,2,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,246,3,4505,0,3393,1589483209

59,Fallout 76,67722767,english,"So I played the game at release and was really disappointed like most people which resulted in me quitting after like 7 hours and haven't touched it since. But with the release of wastelanders I decided to give it another shot and I have to admit that the game improved way more than I expected. I do have to add that I did buy a month of Fallout 1st with the game though so my experience might be a bit different in comparison to people playing without that, the biggest difference probably being that I play solo on a private server instead of an online lobby with randoms and that I got a junkbox which makes organizing resources easier. I'm 23 hours in currently and enjoying it quite a lot. My main points are;

- Big detailed map with lots of interesting places to explore, I constantly keep getting sidetracked by places I want to go explore instead of continuing my quests, which is a good thing in my opinion.

- They added actual quests, storylines, NPC's, dialogue options like you'd expect from a Fallout game, these features were missing at launch which was probably the biggest game breaker for me since it made the whole game feel empty and pointless to me. But now that they added all of those that problem is competely fixed, the quests so far are actually better than I had thought when I learned about the expansion.

- Gameplay is pretty much the same as other Fallout games which I don't mind, The perk system is different though but I don't mind that either.

- I'd say the graphics are good. At some areas they shine way more than in other areas but overall they're good.

I saw that there's quite a bunch of people who have an issue with the price point that the game has after it's rocky road which I can understand. Also saw that a lot of people have an issue with the Fallout1st membership with which I'd have to agree, I don't think this game needs a membership system on top of the initial price. (The membership is optional)

The game does have an In game shop, you can either buy currency or earn it in game by doing challenges, I'm never a fan of in game stores (excluding some games, mainly F2P games and such e.g. Path of Exile) I haven't felt the need to buy anything from it and I don't feel like the game is really pushing it in my face, it's just kinda there. From what I've seen it's mostly cosmetics (gun skins, clothes, emotes etc.) and the challenges so far haven't been difficult, I've been getting quite a lot of the currency by just playing and completing challenges without even completing them on purpose. (Challenges like ""Kill X creatures, Hack X terminals etc.)

I can't really speak about the multiplayer aspect of the game since as I mentioned before I'm playing solo on a private server.

65,Fallout 76,67710452,english,"Now let me start off by saying I have only played one other Fallout game before (Fallout 4), I typically don't enjoy RPG-MultiQuest type games, and personally don't like Bethesda games (Doom, Fallout 4, Skyrim etc...) 

That being said, this game, for some reason, has me keep coming back for more. I've only played eight hours of the game at the time of this review (and I intend on playing a LOT more) and I can't stop playing, besides the obvious bathroom and food breaks. Not only is this game beautiful, I think it is just plain ol' fun. Like I said in the beginning, I'm not an RPG-Quest type of gamer but I love fully exploring the tiniest of places, like a dog house that houses a teddy bear dinner, to the largest of buildings, like a high school filled with half-burned people and empty milk jugs. Each places looks and feels unique. That is one thing I will praise Bethesda on, their level of detail. 

One thing I think Fallout 76 does right is the quest-system, and that's saying something coming from me. Previously mentioned by me, I hate multi-quests games. Having four to five active quests can not only be daunting but just plain annoying, Most quest games I've played are just plain and simply too REPETITIVE. Fallout 76, like it's locations of Appalachia, are diverse enough to keep the player constantly playing more and more. Eight hours have flew by just by roaming and exploring. Why Fallout 76 is fun is, well, you get lost in the world itself.

Multiplayer: 
Well I'm going to keep this short. I have encountered only a few other players in Appalachia and have not experienced any hostility from other players. To be honest, I'm not playing this game for the multiplayer. I'm sure people are having a great time with friends exploring and questing, but it's not for me. 

THE BAD:
Occasional lighting glitches, floating objects, missing textures, and loading textures are the major issues I have faced. Also, ATOMS. . . money making scheme, not worth purchasing any items from the store.

In total, this game is just fun. The sights, story, and game-play are the core elements, I think, that give Fallout 76 it's charm. This game has got me hooked and if you are a Bethesda, Fallout, RPG, Post-Apocalyptic fan than this game is for you.

Some are actually pretty funny/fun to have happen. But apart from the bugs the game is actually really good. With the addition of NPC's the world feels so much alive then before. The stories within the game are all really good too, quite a few that stir up the feelings. Lots of sad/hopeful stories in this one. Lots of environmental story telling. The pvp is still a hot mess when it come to balance, but the chaoticness can make it hilarious and fun.  Basically the game is fun whether exploring alone or with a buddy or 3.

It is a shame that Fallout 76 launched in the state that it did back in 2018. As a player that started with the release of Wastelanders, all I can speak for is the state of the game today. 

NPCs are everywhere, and dialogue/ conversation skill checks are IMO better than they ever were in Fallout 4. 
In 40 hours, I have encountered no crashes, minimal bugs, and an overall level of polish that I have not seen in any previous Fallout title. 
At no point have I witnessed any p2w or aggressive monetization practices. And while Fallout 1st may seem aggressive to some, I personally have no desire to rent a private server when every public world I load into feels like my own game. The game’s premium currency is easily obtainable through gameplay, and aside from some cool cosmetic options, there is no reason players would need to access the Atom Shop.

Game is obviously  in a much better state than it was but is it really enough?

This will be about my full experience rather than wastelanders edition since I am playing for the first time now.
Lets go with pros first.

Pros:
-Appalachia
It is basically the most beautiful map of any Fallout game. Design of towns mountains  etc. is pretty good. It is a joy to explore this land.

-Survival aspects
I played only a handful survival games but i can say this one is balances need of food, water, medicine and sleep pretty well. You even get different buffs from different food and liquids you drink. Also you get a buff from playing an instrument!

-C.A.M.P features
I overall liked the building system despite a few flaws. With the survival aspects, building a cozy little cottage is quite a satisfying experience

CONS:

-Storytelling is simply not good, though stories themselves are
experiencing stories through reading notes and listening holotapes gets old in a few hours. In the end, every story ends up with everybody dying in the end. For example they come up with this cool faction, responders, which are police, doctors, firefighters created a group to help post war settlers, then you find out they are all dead. Also people they helped died as well. Congratz! you are a member of responders, now go out and save people! Oh wait they are all dead. Wastelanders expansion does diminish this dissapointment a little. But again only a little.

-High level mobs in low level zones.
Leveling system is simply not balanced. I would enjoy some zones being dangerous and shouldnt be wandered early, but even in lower level zones you fight level 10 monsters then you see one of them is level 64 and two shots you. It is not fun, just frustrating. 

-Clunkiest AAA shooter experience. 
I can already hear the words "" BuT FalLoUt GameS wErE alWaYs ClUnKy"" well not like this. I shoot someone  and game acknowledges the shot too late, enemy manages to hit me once before dying despite me shooting it earlier. Melee weapons are another joke. Thinking especially on early game you rely on them so much. Half of your swings goes to air even though you have seen it passed trough the enemy. And many times even i spam left click, my character simply does not hit anything. This caused me so many deaths.

-optimization.
I have a 5700 xt and 3600 ryzen and i even have low fps on lower settings. My pc can handle much prettier games. It is simply not acceptable.

-What a fallout MMO could have been

I am adding this because i felt soo dissapointed when i watched its gameplay. It could be a much better experience. There could be factions you could join, raids against enemy factions, more random encounters, smaller factions to grind reputation for etc. Then i thought they just lazied up and brought this. But after playing it i can say a lot of time went to production of this game, which makes me sadder. because Fallout76 is not a lazy cash crab. its a mass of well engineered bad ideas.

I will play this game until i finish the story, but i dont see myself playing it like i do any other online game. And it makes me sad to say for a Fallout game, a franchise i love deeply.",1587393902,1587393902,FALSE,2,0,0.495495498,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,77,6,16162,0,1623,1592749393

5,Fallout 76,67682470,english,"I waited one year after release before I bought it, and even though I am a die hard fan of the Fallout series I must say that this one was a disappointment.
5-10% of the mobs get stuck, animation doesnt work, walks behind furniture and can't navigate out of it.
Yesterday I killed a death claw by punching it to death since it was stuck in it's spawn animation.

NPC doesn't have scripted AI to realize if you are stealing from them (you can basically rob a NPC blind within their house and they won't even flinch), also something we aren't used to in a Fallout game.

The quests (even with the new NPC addition) isn't of the same quality as we are used to within the Fallout franchise. 
I realize they used an old engine when constructing this game  which, I guess, can't handle multiplayer very well but the amount of bugs in this game looks more like an indie developed Beta release than a full fledged Bethesda game.
It feels like playing a mmo, with all that bland world that comes with it.

I will continue to play it and see if it gets better with age, but so far the first impression was not all that I had hoped for (And I really didn't have my hopes up due to their review scores).

So, this is a review that does not really cast a bright light on the game, so why the positive review?
It's still better than most other games out there. It's a huge world with a lot of scavenging and base building. 
Since the price has dropped to $40 (as if writing this) I still must give it a thumbs up. If the price was higher it would have been a negative review.

So all in all,
Could they have done better? Yes.
Is it a disappointment for us fans of the series? Yes.
But they are actually working on it, hard and they dropped the price. So it's still worth your money if you are a fan of either Fallout or basebuilding survival games.

So, I want to start by saying Bethesda really did turn this game around, I have completed the main story behind Wastelanders & I found it super satisfying all the way through! Some of the missions were a bit bland but, It can't be perfect can it? 

Bugs & glitches are abundant in this game as you would expect from Bethesda, The game needs a lot of polish. I've had some bad bugs that stopped me from turning in main quest and in some cases having to restart an entire quest cause the NPC would not complete her action to progress the quest. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!

I am running an i7 9700k w/ an RTX 2070 Super and the game is so unstable. I was getting a locked frame rate of 51 until I went into my ""Documents"" folder to unlock the frame rate.. The game does and can achieve high frame rates but it's everywhere.. It feels sluggish to play but, I find my self just dealing with it sadly.

Another thing I want to talk about is crashes, I only had one in my current 34 hours. On that note I have a friend that decided to buy the game and crashed a total of 3+ times just trying to make a character & he is running an i7 8700k with an RTX 2080 ti. 

Overall the game is WAY better than it was before, I find myself having a great time fighting the monsters and looting the wasteland.

Yes, there has been a shit ton of controversy around this title. Is most of it really F***ed up capitalism and overall poor business practices? yeah. That being said. I have really enjoyed my time in this game so far. The mechanics are really easily introduced, there are rpg elements right out of the vault and memorable characters in the first 20 minutes. 
I'd say about 45% of the storytelling is done through things found in the map. Either through terminals, notes, books or the most common, holotapes. Out of every holotape (they are everywhere) I've found only a few have been either corny or just irrelevant. There are some really heartbreaking stories found in the holotapes. The voice acting from every character is absolutely incredible. I'd say the main area this is lacking is in the raiders. But I haven't sided with them in any story interaction so it could get better over time. 
This game is a bit buggy. Its bethesda, when has it ever not been buggy? Most of the time the fix is the same, either fast travel or walk through a door.
If you are looking for a really good fallout story fix, this fills that void better than fallout 4 does. The gun-play is relatively the same as fallout 4, but bringing back the silent protagonist does wonders for the story telling and RPG elements.
Yes there are microtransactions and a subscription. Is the subscription needed? No. Is it helpful and should the scrap box be in the base game along? Yes. That being said, if you like cosmetics and having a cute house (like me) I'd say its worth it. The 1500 Atoms goes a long way cosmetics wise, as you get more atoms through challenges you complete just by playing. So it's really personal preference. 
HAVE A BUILD FROM LEVEL ONE!!!!
This game is very build dependent and picking the wrong SPECIAL perks early on can really f*** you up. There's a lot of versatility build wise and there's a lot of great forums and reddit threads with every build under the sun.
Last part i promise
This game is kinda reminiscent of ESO in that it's a single player game camouflaged as a multiplayer game. This game can be played totally solo (look up good mat farming locations though, especially if you want a cute house) or in groups. I've met tons of nice players in the world, all the veterans are super helpful and some have just given me things without me asking at all!

Well get ready for the shitstorm that is..........Fallout 76.  I don't even know where to begin.  The tutorial seemed legit, walking through the vault and collecting my items.  I was thinking to myself, ""Oh boy, this isn't as bad as everyone makes it out to be.""  I was so wrong.  The second I step out into the wasteland i was bombarded with a long distance rendering bug that left the terrain in sheets instead of a 3D render.  After that cleared up, i began to walk out into the wasteland.  The first thing i noticed was the graphics.  My god, from a distance the grass and plants look beautiful, almost too good.  Then you get up close and realise that its just a flat surface rendered in 3D.  But graphics aren't a problem, because the game is fun, right?  W R O N G.  First death, i didn't even attack the NPC and his dogs were after me, but he was cool as a cucumber sitting in his chair.  It took me 2 attempts to kill the unbelievably overpowered dogs before he decided to shoot me with his shotgun.  So, after another attempt i finally kill him, and take his gun.  Oh boy, a new gun, with high damage!  Lets equip it!  W R O N G.  Because for whatever reason, Bethesda decided that the good guns need to be level locked, so new players can't use nice guns early on.  but i had hope, and ventured on with the shotgun in my inventory.  Farther we push into the wasteland, until we come to a farm.  In this farm were some scorchers.  Oh boy, easy loot!  I was slaying, i had killed 2 without a single scratch, when suddenly, one comes out of nowhere and decides to attack me.  No problem, i'll just fight back!  W R O N G.  I dumped at least 20 bullets straight into the damn thing, and it did no damage.  On a fucking level 2 scorcher!  And so, of course, i ran, suffering immeasurable damage in the process.  Once out of sight, i heal up, and continue onward.  I come across a player base.  Oh boy, a low level player, maybe we can be a team!  W R O N G.  He took one look at me and one tapped me.  Ah, that's ok, i'll just continue in the other direction when i respawn.  respawned back at the vault, and again, i'm plagued with graphical bugs (not on my end, i checked my systems and they were all fine). 

In addition, when you press ESC to go to the menu, it takes you straight to the map, where you have to press the Z key just to access the menu.  This is such a poor design feature, why not just make it with a normal function?  And the atom shop, if you like this game, don't even bother with the atomic shop.  Bethesda wants you to pay for overpriced aesthetic items that don't have any practical use other than making you a visible target.

Well turns out the Wastelanders update is out now, and after reading a few reviews, mostly negative, a few positive. I decided it was time for me to just bite the bullet and buy the game. And well, its great! If you enjoyed fallout 4 you will  enjoy this game.

I've barely scratched the surface of what there is to do in this game however, so I will come back and update this review once I've played more.

42,Fallout 76,67657800,english,"Even with the latest Wastelanders ""DLC"" (AKA bug fixes) this thing is a pile of trash.  Interfaces are confusing, default keymaps are nothing like most PC games, you have to edit INI files to make it run right, you've gotta mess with control panels to force vsync modes so the mouse doesn't lag like crazy, the ui is designed for consoles and was barely changed for PC ergonomics.

The game provides a lot of information and it often comes all at once so your trying to read and commit to memory notifications about how to do things and because the notifications come so fast they cause the existing notifications to disappear within seconds of showing and you're lost if you miss anything.

The human models are terrible, super low poly and just badly made.

Models often clip through things, breaking any attempt at suspending belief.

Every time I exit the game the game has re-organized and sized my windows so they are all tiny and at the top-left of my screen.

You can't paste your password to login.  So, if you are like me, and you like secure/long/random passwords you are screwed unless you want to type it in one special character at a time.  You can't paste anything actually, no text box in the game will take a paste.

The bethesda.net website makes creating an account difficult.  If you accidentally click off of the signup modal it resets the whole thing and you have to start over.  None of the input boxes allow password managers to interact with them, so you must manually type all your auth stuff in and then make sure you go back to your password manager and add the account correctly there.

The game doesn't give you any indication that you progress has been saved (at least not as far as I saw).  And it does not save until after you leave the vault.  So, if you spent 30 minutes creating just the right character and then quit the game to deal with something in life, then load the game back up you'll find your character was never saved.

The list goes on.  I'm exhausted by the hours I've put into this game just to attempt at making it playable.

If Fallout had a baby with one of the many survival genre games these days, this is pretty much what you'd get, minus the glowing nuclear diaper waste.  You're looking at a maximum of 24-32 players on a server, which for the size of the map, isn't too bad.  It really does feel like they've transferred the assets from Fallout 4 into this title, but to be completely honest, that's not entirely a bad thing.  I love the whole future-retro vibe, and in typical Fallout fashion, they throw little jabs at the 50's era, some of which I found quite funny.
**Spoiler alert:**---> [spoiler](Like packs of cigarettes on a med vendor ... remember the magazine ads where 9 out of 10 doctors smoked Camels?  Yeah, that kinda thing.)[/spoiler]

That being said, I'm having a ball exploring and questing away.  I haven't had the pleasure of teaming with anyone, but I haven't bothered to try just yet.  As with anything, there's a bit of a learning curve to the controls and the interface but it's not so bad.  I turned the background music off and went first person, and as far as first person type games go, it's a pretty solid 
If you're one of the ""hardcore purists"" who just can't seem to let go of the first couple of Fallout games, I might pass...but if you can handle a little evolution, it's great.

91,Fallout 76,67627735,english,"demn after all those negative review i jump inside the game and let me tell you something. it didn't disappoint me. now i know why those negative reviews are made. i think they are not those solid fan or  people who love this kind of game or people who only played fallout 4. believe me so far i haven't encountered any bugs or anything that in fact i thought my PC cannot handle the game since i dont meet the minimum  requirements but i was shock how smooth and peaceful the game is. i really miss fallout and thank you bethesda for introducing another fallout series. here are the list that i want to debate with those negative reviews:

1) force multiplayer? 
-dudes are you not happy you can share the love of fallout with your friends or strangers? well you guys are dumb or just plain selfish. its fun to walk around then suddenly meeting some players. i bump with one player and we just wave each other. it's nice to see the wasteland now have real players not just NPC's

2) full of bugs? 
-really now like i said i havent encountered one yet and the game runs perfectly for me. i have i5 4670 and gtx 1060 3gb and 8gb of ram. perfect 60fps. though sometimes when entities load it will drop to 30 then back to 60 again. but it will not change your gameplay.

3) pay2win because of repair kits?
-well i admit its kinda unfair for bethesda for making those repair tools or repair option a pay only option. but i guess i just look at the otherside of the box and just think that atleast the game will not be that boring where when you get your power weapons its the end of the line. the constant grinding and looting made this problem kinda balance. i mean just go loot another weapon or armor then build it up again. they mixed a little grinding method in the game so i think its nice. but yes kinda down for the repair option.

4) have to pay premium to get your own world or instance?
- you guys boomers or what? i mean have you seen a lot of multiplayer games lately? well i'm not bias or anything but somehow or somewhere those games have to have their own profit besides selling the game. thats why i understood those items or things you have to buy or subscribe. for me i decided to support the developers since i have been playing pirated version of the previous games. and hotdog people its fking worth it..

this new series of fallout have a lot of potentials. try it for yourself don't let bandwagons just ruin your mood specially when you are a diehard fan of this series. overall i'm going to rate it 9/10. -1 point only where you have to buy repair tools but demn.. you never disappoint me bethesda. thank you for this game",1587304461,1587304461,TRUE,1,0,0.473616779,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,58,6,7226,0,248,1597456886

94,Fallout 76,67302432,english,"IGNORE the negative reviews, or at least take it with a grain of salt.

I have been ignoring this game since launch because all of the negative reviews. But, since it's coming to steam, might as well give it a shot.

I just dont get why all the hate of this game... gameplay wise. Yes the fps issue kinda suck, yes it might be a bit lonely, and yes they try to sell you atom shop stuff but I dont mind that all. 

The variety of new enemies (comparing to FO4) are a breath of fresh air. You can setup ""settlement"" wherever you like, a bit of survival elements of thirst and hunger, mixed with the standard FO4 mechanics feels right. Those who complain about the VATS system can go fornicate themselves because FO76 is what VATS supposed to be. It is an ASSISTED targeting system!! get off your nostalgia high horse of past Fallout.

Get this game, might be a bit expensive for what it is but who knows what content they'll adding down the road.  7/10

[added more review after 23+ hours]
it's true there are several bugs in the game (bethesda classic) but none of them are game breaking. There is one bug that annoy me so much, it's in the build menu. I cant remove a part of a structure even though it's standing on its own (not dependent with another objects), also I experience lag between my gunshot and enemies reacting to the hit, but at least it registered as a hit as soon as I pull the trigger so it doesnt annoy me that much.

There are tons of quest here with interesting back story that you piece together from terminal and holotapes, in which I must mention have good voice acting! seriously.

Other players were quite nice, always saying Hi and not bullying new players.

Graphic upgrade my ass, they just up the color saturation and increase the sun rays. I hate that

The Good
+giant Map with TONS of thngs to do. 
+great atmosphere that can really immerse the player.
+big and relatively convenient crafting system.
+base building is simple and effective, can be setup almost anywhere. 
+npc´s and quests are pretty good.

The Bad
-Multiplayer which means random People doing their own thing sometimes near you, which wouldnt be to bad if it had...
----no text-chat. Got a question? Just wanna Talk to People? Wanna ask around to group up or do quests? Well to bad, thats FORBIDDEN. 
-lag, which is to be expected in a game like this. Same with the occational server crash.
-again because of multiplayer, expect things to be dragged out a bit. Grinding is part of the game.
-Suprisingly i encountered very few bugs. But they are there so beware. Its a Bethesda Game after all. 
-the lore got butchered to make it fit, its an abomination, dont consider this a Fallout game. 
-i guess i should mention the abortion that is the ATOMSTORE, wether you want to spend extra money on an already fullprice game is your own decision, i wanted to but all i found was ugly (overpriced) garbage. 

Still, all things considered this game is pretty damn good (now), you can easely get a your money´s worth IF you like exploring and looting.

But please, never forget, Bethesda released this game one year to early to make a quick buck. They used the early buyers as test subjects for their Alpha. They overpriced their Atomshop. They sold shoddy, overpriced merchandise. And they failed at the basics of consumer proctection by leaking their contact informations. Its a final prodcut NOW.

8,Fallout 76,67616337,english,"I have so much praise to give. Let me just say that this update did A LOT to fix the issues with this game. Most of my playtime was on Bethesda.net launcher but I prefer Steam so the play time on here will not be reflective of my overall experience. 

First, the talking. Going back to an unvoiced protagonist coupled with a much more detailed and fleshed out system for talking with NPCs means I am not having the most fun ever since New Vegas just talking to people. The fact that my Strength, Charm, etc etc all can effect dialogue is a great departure from Fallout 4. Once again we can not only see the gates (like in New Vegas) so we know what stats we might want to raise to get more out of an NPC but there is now more than just the 4 speech options in 4.

Second, enemy variety is amazing. This along with location variety, larger map, more detailed crafting, need to drink and eat, the return of durability.... wow! I am so glad Bethesda did not just let this game die like many said in the community. 

There are some negatives though. I am sad that I cannot see my armor pieces on my character like I could in 4. I have full leather on but I still just look like I'm wearing my base outfit. Also, I wish that the game would let you select an option to only search for servers where your base will not be obstructed. Getting matched to a server is quick but sometimes having to search for a new server because another base is in your way is a little annoying. 

I love that I can move my base and that ammo and stuff are less common, at least early on.

You play the game a bit more and get to finally build your camp! YAY! You are able find a nice spot, the sun is hitting the trees just right to give you a wallpaper-esque looking view and you decide that is the spot to build. You place the C.A.M.P. down and start placing walls down only to find almost everything is locked behind recipes and plans hidden throughout the world. Totally fine, might as well keep playing, the game is pretty fun. 

I am about 30 hours into the game. I am finding it hard to recommend it because the most fun parts of fallout 4 for me was building a settlement and giving commands to my settlers to sleep in a certain bed, giving them a task, watching my settlement become automated and look alive. In fallout 76 I am assuming people are supposed to make friends somehow without a chatbox and only voice, and just build close to each other in private worlds to make a town.

This is my third facepalm and the reason I am writing this review. The storage capacity being limited in a game where you can build as many boxes as you want just irks me. The build limit as well is really low and just decorating my camps perimeter with mutfruit and razorgrain to make it look nicer puts a massive dent in the build limit.

I wrote down what I didnt like the most but I am going to make a summary list of, in my opinion, the negative aspects of fallout 76 

1) Way too many workshop items behind recipes and plans. 
2) In the place of a communication system is an emote wheel (which you spend money on to get more). No chat box. and I dont want to talk to people with a mic so I guess Ill be solo
3) There is a 800lb weight storage limit TOTAL for your C.A.M.P. no matter how many storage containers you make. also you cant sort your stuff into different containers.
4) There is a monthly subscription that sells quality of life improvements
4.5) There is a micro transaction shop that sells plans and quality of life items (the atomic shop isnt that bad honestly, just a slap in the face is all)
5) Cant make a settlement with (10+your charisma level) settlers in it like in fallout 4
6) I just died and revived to find my disease followed me through the afterlife and resurrection. 
7) There is one radio station.
8) A lot of new features in fallout 76 are mods from fallout 4 nexus. (which in a way is a good thing because at least they know to add improvements to their game(or so we thought)).

I will update this with more bad decisions made by bethesda when i find them. I just wish I had watched a few hours of gameplay first to figure out I wouldnt like this. its basically a bare bones fallout version of Citadel: Forged with fire, except theres a limit or a lock on everything, instead of nothing.",1587281014,1587281589,FALSE,65,1,0.662224352,2,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,133,27,2526,0,2011,1595120913

23,Fallout 76,67609100,english,"So I'm 30 hours in and taking my time. I recommend this game honestly because we're current on lock down and I love Fall Out, so I would buy this even if I knew about the issues before hand. I also bought this right after the Wastelanders release, so the issues may be due to it and may get fixed. Hera are a couple big flaws:
1) LAAAGGGG. I don't play on a team, and it could just be me, but all the NPCs move by blinking 5 feet at a time, and sometimes I get big pauses when I harvest, open a container, or craft. Sometimes it moves smoothly, but the lag is there more often than not. I've tried reducing graphics, but it doesn't improve. Plus the fact that opening containers produces the lag, it seems like its communicating with a remote server. I can run Fallout 4 maxed out, so I don't think its a lack of local resources. Which brings me to the next point:
2) As you've probably already read about, graphically this is more of a HUGE DLC for Fallout 4. If you spent a lot of time in 4, you'll immediately recognize most items and architecture. There are some new enemies, and people look different, but its too close to 4 to feel like a new game. 
Game play-wise there are many differences, some are still annoying to me. Carry capacity is much more of consideration as ammo and chems now have weight. Your crafted and harvested food also spoils. Bobble heads and magazines have only limited boost durations. You have to unlock most of the building items. Some things I really miss is having settlers, but maybe that comes deeper in the game. You can't strip your kills anymore; they only offer a few items  and not their whole wardrobe (but maybe that also comes latter in perks). Leveling perks are a bit different too with random card packs.
The things that are the same are the sad tales of life after the bombs drop. the building and crafting, and the open-worldness of it all. It keeps me playing despite other annoyances.",1587280172,1587280172,TRUE,2,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,36,5,24279,0,1818,1594448212

25,Fallout 76,67594441,english,"I've played pretty much every open world Bethesda game since I was a child starting with Daggerfall. When this game was announced I laughed at it during E3 after the absolute mess of a game Fallout 4 was. I continued to enjoy watching videos of it's downfall solely because I was cynical and jaded over my experience with Bethesda's most recent titles. 

I never even CONSIDERED touching 76 at launch, but I enjoyed reading reviews and forums complaining about it. Fast forward to April 2020. Someone who's opinion I trust strongly purchased 76 with the Wastelanders update on Steam on the 14th, and wouldn't stop talking about it. I gave him s**t, mocked him, then went home and did research. As I read reviews and saw videos... it didn't look half bad. Todd got me. I made the purchase. 

And I am extremely happy. This game is what the sequels to Fallout 3/NV should have been if you play it like a single player experience. The NPCs are well written, the dialogue is similar to FO3/NV, the exploration is enjoyable, the map is dense and full of well designed locations, and Bethesda's strongest skill, their environmental storytelling is at their peak. There's all sorts of shady motels, abandoned carnivals, and empty cabins with a story to tell through notes and the surroundings. I assume they had to make the locations very interesting because THERE WERE NO NPCs. Thank god there are now. I can't imagine this game without them. I highly recommend this game to any Bethesda or fallout fan, old games or newer. 

*** IF YOU DON'T READ MY REVIEW, AT LEAST READ THIS ***
                    (MAJOR FIX FOR PC PLAYERS AT 144 hz) 

When I loaded the game up, the mouse felt fu***** awful, my FPS was between 30-33, and it felt generally terrible to play. 
DO THIS FIX.

If you have an Nvidia card, disable vertical sync (V sync) in both GLOBAL and the program settings for Fallout 76. Then, download Rivaturner. This program allows you to cap the FPS of a game. If you have a 144hz monitor, cap it  at 71 FPS - the max the game allows. If your monitor is 60 hz obviously cap it at 60.
Then go to C:\Users\*your account*\Documents\My Games\Fallout 76, create a NOTEPAD file titled Fallout76Custom.ini, and put 

[Controls]
bMouseAcceleration=0

Into the file. Save it there and it should now be an .ini file (check the properties to make sure). This will disable mouse acceleration and made the game feel literally 10x better.

When you first leave the vault you are greeted by a robot, which is normal for fallout 76. But when you walk a few more feet you're presented with actual human npcs. They send you on a wild chase to some bar with people in it. And boom! you're given a choice that effects how you play the game. you can join the raiders, or side with the settlers. I chose the settlers because I'm too nice. And honestly, this content is more engaging than fallout 4 ever was to me.

Apart from Watch Dogs 2 and Fallout 4, another Bethesda game, this has to be he most unoptimized PC game I've ever played. My PC can run Red Dead Redemption 2 almost perfectly but can't handle a game that looks straight out of the seventh generation. My framerate will be perfectly fine (albeit after editing the ini files because this game lacks standard graphics settings like antialiasing) until it has to load background objects and foliage a few feet down the road. When this happens, the game stutters for no reason. I've jumped through every single hoop I possibly could to fix this to no avail. The game stutters constantly in interiors as well. I've also gotten glitches like invulnerable enemies and locked containers that refuse to open despite picking the lock five times in a row.
Really, this is my fault. I played this game a lot on Xbox One and I had to deal with the nightmare of getting Fallout 4 to run on PC like a normal game. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. I shouldn't have expected anything more of a company like Bethesda. I was actually looking forward to playing this game at a higher framerate than on console, but it's like Bethesda heard this and got their shovel ready to shovel shit into my face as well as the faces of their entire customer base. I'm sorry, but if you play this and think adding content that should've been in the game since launch magically frees Bethesda of it's guilt there must be something wrong with you.
I can't even really comment on the Wastelanders content because I've spent more time trying to get this game to work properly than actually playing it. From what I have played, it's standard Fallout affair and seeing human characters in previously barren locations does make the world feel more alive. It's just a shame how poorly this world is optimized. Please don't support Bethesda until they learn to optimize their games and use a better engine.",1587169449,1587253700,FALSE,13,1,0.496782154,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,160,9,1069,0,250,1587672879
62,Fallout 76,67592467,english,"i got this game on more or less a whim after seeing what was coming with wastelanders. despite some drawbacks, it's a fun romp in the woods with your friends! there's some new stuff and it has a lot of the same issues as fallout 4, but it still has that ""fallout"" feel that came with new vegas and other fallout games, less so fallout 4.

[h1]The Pros[/h1] 

[b]it's fun with friends[/b] - i played this for the first time with a friend who'd been playing since launch. he invited his own friend and we all had a fun time running around the map and looking for copper scrap. My second session only lasted 2 or 3 hours, but my friend and i still had a great time.

[b]the new stuff isn't out of place[/b] - you'd think that with a bunch of cultists raving about mothman and these new feral ghoul-type enemies with the scorched, the game would be far changed from the original feel of the games, but nope! the new enemies and factions just add flavor to the base experience, like how if i recall correctly, nuka cola quantum added just one new fruit (and strontium) to the base nuka cola, and ramped it up to an 11. I love the new feel of this world.

[b]the community[/b] - everyone is so polite. i haven't had any negative interactions with other players so far. usually we just wave to each other and go about our business. it's nice, in a way, having human interaction in the game. you think you'd be opposed to that kind of stuff. i've heard there are player-made shops, and now it's my personal goal to start one of my own once i get to see what there is in the game, just to interact and help people out.

[h1]the cons[/h1]

[b]the glitches[/b] - just because there's a new coat of paint doesn't fix some of the issues that i've seen others complain about. here are some of the ones i've encountered:

-fast traveling to my camp spawns me in a rock, but i can walk out of it, so it's not a big deal.

-due to the way the game world loads itself, i walked right through a door and ended up in a place where i needed a key to get out. i just fast traveled out.

-sometimes enemies would just stop. like, stop. there was a place where a deathclaw was supposedly going to pop out of the ground according to my friend, but despite the ground moving around, it never came out. enemies will also sometimes seem to die, but not really die, and you can't look them. not necessarily game-breaking, but certainly sigh-inducing.

[b]the nature of the game[/b] - the game wasn't originally intended to have npcs, so some of the places they can be are a bit jarring or out of place. finding a prospector out while exploring isn't that bad, but seeing people wanting to restart the responders, but knowing that they never will, and will instead just stand there forever since it's an online game, can be a bit strange.

all in all, it's fun, if nothing else, and i'd say to give it a shot. even if mmos aren't your thing, just exploring the map and building your c.a.m.p. is great by itself.",1587253586,1587253586,TRUE,0,0,0.497702897,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,104,6,981,0,618,1590524330

6,Fallout 76,67502028,english,"Alright. I'm gonna have an unpopular opinion...
I like it. It's a solid 7/10, with friends. I'll get back to this in a bit.

I will admit that I used to be on the hate bandwagon for this game a very long time ago when Bethesda was pulling their bullsh*t, and a lot of my friends were of a like mind. Recently however I had been hearing about Wastelanders, and I had talked to people and we all kind of agreed that the game itself wasn't that bad but bethesda's actions were not good, with how they treated their customers. In my opinion it looks like Bethesda is trying to fix the game. 

I can't really compare the game before wastelanders because I didn't play, so, maybe my view is colored by the fact that the holotape recordings arent the only ways to get quests anymore and I really like the NPCs they've added. That said, I do like those. I do like following a paper trail. Or I guess a cassette trail. Whatever. 

For those who would go calling me a bethesda shill, simply don't. You're wasting your time, and frankly, I dont have the time nor the willpower. 

I've been a big fallout fan since my first introduction to the series, Fallout 3. Fallout 3 was often judged by many as a ""Bad"" game despite doing many things New Vegas did, if not better. Fallout 3 was a mixed bag of a weirdly made and not super well written story and a boatload of excellent sidequests, and generally good gameplay. That said, I also loved New Vegas. I even liked Fallout 4, that's something of a sin these days too.

Was I excited when Fallout 76 launched? No. I knew exactly what was gonna happen, and I was calling it accurately. Call me Nostradamus. I could see a mile away that a new multiplayer game was gonna be problematic. They almost always are these days. I was telling everyone to not buy the game at the time. And you know what? I think it was the right call then.

Now, things are different. The wastelanders DLC adds a lot to the table. There's more product there for what you're paying. As far as value to the consumer, if you really hated the dialogue in fallout 4 but you're more of a fan of New Vegas or Fallout 3 style dialogue, the wastelanders update really does raise the bar in that regard. There's a lot of choice. I can lie, which locks me out of dialogue options. I can be a jerk and call people out on their BS. I can be just like OK, what do you need done. I can say no. There's not as much railroading like there seems to be in Fallout 4 where every dialogue option is Yes, Sarcastically but yes, No, Ask a question and that's all you get. However this isn't a review of the wastelanders DLC. 

The game itself, the shooting mechanics, well, they are just Fallout 4. If you liked Fallout 4's gunplay and the way that handles, then Fallout 76 is nice for that. 

As for the optimization, I'm not super impressed with this. The game looks fine. It actually looks really good on my GeForce RTX 2070 and Ryzen 5 2600 system. Doesn't run bad for me. My friend on an older i7-7700K and GTX 1060 seems to have some problems with lag from time to time. I think the worldspace being so big and not segmented like it probably should be is partly to blame... Fallout 4 has similar issues in when going into Boston, so it might just be an engine thing when it's attempting to render a lot at once. Again, that said, the game being a bit foliage or object heavy isn't a problem for me, and it would probably run just as good on my Radeon RX Vega 64. But, buyer beware as far as that goes. 

I've played a few hours of it. So far I've built a nice cabin overlooking a river valley. 10/10 on the map design. But that's expected given Bethesda and their experience crafting interesting worlds.

Now remember when I said that the game is fun with friends? I dont know if I could play this by myself. But then, I often feel that way about Fallout 4, which is why I usually get one of the companions in Fallout 4. The game does feel a little empty. Players are usually far apart, so getting some buddies to play this with is a must in my opinion. If you have no friends or you aren't social or dont want to travel the wasteland with friends, then this game might not be for you. I dont think this game was designed to be played alone initially. I think they tweaked the difficulty so that it was possible to do alone but I think the game was intended to be played with friends. The markings of that are all there. There's a lot of benefit to teaming with friends, they earn caps if I complete a quest, I earn caps if they complete a quest, I can easily fast travel to their camps and we can all just hang out. Speaking of, the player base of the game as far as I've determined is very chill. So if you're worried everyone is a raider or something, then I would say don't worry too much. I literally set up a workshop for like half an hour at the Tyler County Dirt Track, a player ran by, did nothing, didn't try to claim the workshop or steal my junk. ""HEY BACK OFF THIS IS MY TRASH HEAP"" or whatever the line from Deacon is in Fallout 4 would be fitting right about now. Jokes aside, this game is a lot like RDR2 in that the online experience with other players isn't toxic. Though, your mileage may vary.

All in all, 7/10, the gameplay is actually pretty good, my experience has been largely bug free aside from an issue I had where I was lagging a bit when playing with my friend in Germany. If you want to solo, I dont think this game does the solo thing very well. It all depends on you however.

29,Fallout 76,67548450,english,"Wastelanders update has added much of what the game needed at launch. The vanilla game must still be played since Wastelanders has a stopping point in the story until you reach lvl 20, this is a bit of a let down just because the addition of npc's really makes this game come alive. The vanilla game has not been changed and is still much the same experience. They peppered a few npc's over the vanilla landscape but they don't have anything to really do with the story. 

The Atom show is still very much still a thing and I had a hard time deciding to give this at all a good review just based on the shady stuff bethesda does with this. 

The game does have some P2W tropes. Since purchasing the sub allows for an infinite scrap pool(among other things) this can be argued as giving paid players an edge. I am not sure I can make that argument since it is after all just building materials. There is also the ability to buy repair kits from the atom store. Again this isn't anything too p2w but I would rather not have it in the game. 

The sub also grants access to a private world that you can invite friends to. Player robbing doesnt seem to happen too often since damage is reduced until both parties fire but it does happen and effects from other players can be ignored by paying bethesda money. 

Honestly the best part of the game for me has been there since launch but glaring issues got in the way, player houses. I am a sucker for housing in any game and its great here.

So far in my eight hours of play I have yet to experience any serious bugs, a far cry from launch.

Because they patch it and adds different things in game since the steam release and it diffenitly looks good right now.

I tryed it before steam.
On Bethesda launcher there was a free period at the battleroyale release. Didnt do much of the BT.
On normal tho, quest was borring, get quest on terminal/computer, no interaction so no choice.
Take your quest and go.

But since it realeased on steam, you can make choice and the world looks more alive. 
When you start the game and come accross your first npc giver, a screen pop up and say you're choice matter and it is instancied, like you go in a bar solo or with your group and make choice.
Didnt tryed yet to rerol and make an other choice so i cant really confirm but i see it easily possible without spoiler.

Fallout 1st is for a Private Server of 8 friends, people are expecting that to be free, dedicated servers are NOT free, but they also aren't necessary as I said I've not ran into an KOS people.
Lastly, You CAN repair weapons and armor without spending Atoms(Game Currency) on Repair Kits.

Then the hilarious shitshow happened that lasted till now when we get too.... one of the biggest comebacks since Hello Games and No Mans Sky.
I know Im only 14 hours in but it plays better than in beta, look way better than before, is much mucm more stable (no disconnect so far). NPC are much better voiced and written than in Fallout 3 and 4 and quests are interesting. I've read somewhere that new plot and proper stuff starts when you get to lvl 20 and, honestly and surprisingly, I can say that I cant wait when i get there and Im having a lot of fun so far. Community is extra friendly (veterans were waiting on launch day near the vault giving items to new players and giving tips, this happened in every server, i tried switching worlds and there was multiple vets helping everywhere).
I've seen a lot of negativity about thirst&hunger and stash limit - while i think the unlimited storage behind the paywall shouldnt exist (tent is enough) the limit actually makes you build your base to make space and you can use containers near a stash to keep more stuff at hand (it just wont be used when building). Breakind down junk for mats manually and not through building stuff also makes space in your stash. Thirst&hunger is thematic and is only annoying for the first few levels until you get going with supplies.
All in all and especially at this price now it's worth a buy. It's finally a proper Fallout game and second only to New Vegas when it comes to new ones. Thats what i feel after 14 hours.",1587193121,1587193121,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,168,2,1442,0,847,1587677974

Then the Wastelanders Update dropped. I saw news about it on April Thirteenth, Homestuck Day, and the day prior to the Wastelanders Update launching. I looked into it after a disappointing upd8 and it had my main want, Human NPCS. A lot of them. So I Bought it for Steam. After an hour I remembered to review  it negatively and say ""Fucc u bethesda"" but after playing more and more I really like it. It's no New Vegas and its arguably no Fallout 3 Either.

- The Wastelanders added a lot of quest content with good writing and plenty of humor, the NPCs also make the world feel more alive
- The performance is good, much better than it used to be

The bad parts:

- The graphics got worse with fake HDR effects with way overdone transition between dark and bright areas.
- There are still plenty of bugs like floating objects
- The character animations are still pretty poor, this is very noticeable when you talk to NPCs
- The PvP is still pretty bad, with poor performance, lack of large battles and various cheats which work in PvP (fast teleport, fast travel, aim assist, wallhack, infinite ammo - the cheat which allows these things was already updated for Wastelanders).
- The ""pay2win"" part where you pay to have extra crafting component storage is still bad, if you have ""pay2win"" like that at least make the game free to play instead of forcing people to pay twice.
- The private servers are still behind paywall which is very greedy, Bethesda should have allowed anyone to host their own servers with as many people per server as you want and with any mods you want to (including vehicles), including unlimited storage. We all know they are too greedy to do this, though.
- The lack of text chat is still INEXCUSABLE in multiplayer game. A lot of people cannot use voice chat for many reasons, including physical disabilities, and you are essentially making this game ""single player"" for all of them unless they do things like use Discord to communicate with friends through text.

Long story short - yes, the game has improved but a lot of problems still remain.

30,Fallout 76,67481252,english,"Never played Fallout 76 before. Bought the deluxe edition with Fallout 1st subscription when the Wastelanders expansion hit and i'm loving it. 

I'm running a high end machine with an i9 9900k, 32gig @3200mhz and of course a Geforce 2080Ti and was blown away at the game play, graphics and smooth connection (G5) without experiencing any latency on the adventure server. (I'm located in the city of Sydney, Australia).

Nothing like witnessing an atomic bomb drop,  the mushroom cloud blanket your vision.
NPCs are now in the game as i read they weren't before, they are engaging and the quests lines I've encountered are in-depth with a good flow in story. 

For me, the best experiences are the Random world events and quests that appear.
You can play the game solo, but this game is definitely at its best if working in a team, 2+ or more. 

Open pvp is a feature in this game but its not forced and despite this, the general populace is civil, sometimes even friendly. Especially to new players. Rare for a open pvp/pve hybrid platform.

Bottom line, if you've been sitting on the fence about trying the franchise, you don't need to start out by buying all the extras and paying for the subscription. You can still get the full effects of the game just with the basics. The dc content you can save up for, but the subscription i personally feel a little too much for what it offers in perks. Needs to come down by at least 50%. To put it into context, you'll get far more entertainment value in a Netflix monthly subscription than you will for Fallout 1st. This appears to have always been a pain point with previous reviews I've read since launch,

Exploration is a big part of this game and those enjoying searching nooks and crannies for secrets and secluded spots will be rewarded.

Combat can be challenging at time when you have to deal with radiation, mutation, thrist and hunger while fighting. But once you get the hang of it, it becomes easier. Just do not forget that you can add weapons and supplies/medication to your scroll-quick access wheel.

Building is fun with lots of options to choose from. And the fact that you can save your build to a blueprint to easily move it without having to rebuild it each time is a great addition that is actually missing in all other survival/building games.

The game can be creepy/surprising/funny/sad/... And not just in its quests/npc. If you just look at its world, a lot of objects tell you a story by just how they are placed with each others. Like a tombstone with a teddy bear on it to suggest that a child is resting there. Or more teddy bears gathered around a fire camp and sharing beers.

The perks card system is very interesting as it gives a lot of freedom on character customization. Sure there are perks that are almost mandatory because of their usefulness (everything for weight reduction, lock-picking and hacking). But beyond that just go as you want and you can always change on the fly to adapt to the situation.

There are still the occasional bug of mobs spawning underground and such little things. But this is something that happens in almost every game. And usually walking/fast-travelling somewhere and back again fixes it.

All in all, people should forget those early days when this game was crap and give it a chance. I know I did, and I do not regret it.

53,Fallout 76,67478143,english,"This isn't Fallout 5

I decided to write a review for this as I am one of the few people that like Fallout: Tactics. If you come into this game expecting Fallout 5 then you will be disappointed. If you come in expecting a Fallout themed MMO you should be happy.

I tend to play solo, like I have always on MMOs with minimal multiplayer interaction. I've been having fun for the reasons said elsewhere. It is not my favourite Fallout game but that is for the reason MMOs aren't my favourite genre (can't pause, there is some grind to solo, mechanics around item decay/ hunger are quick acting to make an economy a thing). You don't see the change in the world. Although the main quests have instances which remember your actions.

A solo game is most like the older 3D Fallouts in survival mode. The general setting is one of 'new settlers' and so the story isn't told to you obviously. Basically it is critisied for what many games are praised for when giving plot.

For those wondering if you can be griefed and the like. Not really. There are a number of good measures in place for that.

Most of the plot is given indirectly, which suits the themes of the games, and it really rewards paying attention to subtle clues and exploring. I've found most places have a couple of interesting things around them. All the little clues that it was a living world, the signs of those who survived etc. Having always been a fan of plot and world building being done by verisimilitude rather than being hit in the face of it I like it. Generally the main quest lines are quite slow but that is part of their nature considering the premise of the game.

When I saw that Fallout 76 was coming to Steam, I really considered it, and after watching some reviews decided to buy. I really wanted to like the game, especially with the Wastelander update, but it doesn't look like it's salvageable. I'll admit that I had never played F76 before, but I have nearly 300 hours on F4. As someone else said in another review - if there was a way to play this offline without the atom store harassment, then this could be a really cool game. By the way, it straight up feels like harassment when you hit M to check the map and are first hit with a prompt to buy some item in the atom store. Not long after this I went to repair a gun and was given the option to buy a repair kit. I could hardly believe it. I went ahead and checked out the store, and my brain was immediately overwhelmed with all the options for custom armors. I got myself a repair, repaired the gun and felt completed unsatisfied with what I had just experienced. It was essentially cheating. Why not teach the players (or I guess their characters) how to make repair kits? 

There seem to still be several major graphical issues with this game - and note that I only played for less than 2 hours! The second scorched I came across was literally stuck under some stairs. Most of its body was under the floor. I shot at it several times and missed, yet it was able to shoot at and hit me! When I came across the human NPC at the first church, her dog was clipping through her legs. The lack of quality control in this game is unreal. Finally, I missed many shots while trying to take out some of the farming robots, and I realized that there must be some kind of lag issue. I only got good shots if the enemies were directly in front of me and not moving. It just feels unplayable. 

If you're like me, then the reason why you play games, but especially these types of RPG/adventure/survival first-person shooters is to escape real life for a while. It is absolutely immersion breaking to be offered atom store items as I mentioned above, and I hated it so much. Fallout 4 in survival mode and with some mods is a perfectly fun game to play. You can argue about some of its flaws, but it is a FUN way of escaping reality in my free time. 

The only way I might consider revisiting this game is if it's on sale for less than $20. The $40 I paid for it is simply not worth it. Whatever corporate committee at Bethesda decided to go down the route of micro-transactions, comical quality control standards, and overall lack of respect for gamers/customers really ruined this game, and probably the future for the entire franchise.

Fallout 76 is a rough one, the decision to remove NPCs and have the player experience the lives of the those who lived in the wasteland was a gamble and although I kind of understand where the Devs were going with it, it didn't end up as interesting as they intended. I don't HATE Fallout 76 but I am definitely ranking it low on the list of favorite Fallouts. 

PRE WASTELANDER

The game was actually pretty fun to play but the content was slim when you actually finished the main quest line and some side quests. All there was left to do is grind the same 7 events and drop nukes but that gets boring after some time. So, they added the vault raid and honestly I couldn't finish it because it was so buggy. So...that is all there was unless you like BR's and played Nuclear Winter.

POST WASTELANDER

I love it. The game visually looks different so they definitely overhauled the graphics and added some more detail which I appreciate. 

Of course, with the added NPCs the environment feels more alive and less empty you will run into roaming caravans and Raiders fighting Scorched.

The dialogue is...OK. I feel like the choices are kind of generic and not so special. I can follow along with the conversation but none of the choices I have available feel meaningful, not compared to FO3 or F:NV. 

Overall I think this is what the base game should have been. I do think the idea of leaving the vault to a dead world is cool but I just don't think it was executed well.

Bethesda was crazy to charge $60 for a semi-completed world and the amount of bugs and in some cases hacks that allowed people to steal from others is not forgivable but at the end of the day if we are just focusing on the content I think it is much better than it was a year ago.

I am really glad I waited because before this new dlc i dont think I would have enjoyed the game too much. However with this wastelander expansion I am really having fun right now. Is it better then fallout 4? Probably not, however it does feel more... open like I do what I want which is something I am liking, I am just a dude on a quest to find a fedora hat lol. I am still quite new so we will have to see what happens. If the game keeps engaging me.

As far as the in game shop goes it is a little over priced but its actually not that big of a deal. Soo many people have made such a big deal about it and honestly I dont really feel like I need anything in the store (I am someone very much against in game purchase stuff though acknowled it comes with alot of mmos which I usually dont play). Like to be honest I'm surprised Bethesda doesnt have some more armour skin varieties that are really well made and look awesome to try and entice me.
Anyway I like that I feel like I dont need anything from the store. That's a good feeling. Will I buy any atoms? Probably not. I do earn atoms in game so might save up for that under armour that's kinda cool. And the repair kits (bethesda had better stick with just repair kits and not add more game affecting things) I'll just make kits myself no big deal lol.
Anyway ya game still needs alot of work and Bethesda has certainly dropped the ball with this one.
Again I'm a noob so take what I say with a grain of salt but it is a game you can have fun with, wondering around the wasteland.

I recommend it and we will see what Bethesda adds next so hopefully the game will keep getting better. However having said that it does depend on what your looking for. Oh I did die once and had a really hard fight where I didn't die but it was tough. That made me happy ESO is soo easy it bores the living shit out of me. Course I am like level 6. Still I am looking forward to playing more.

I probably wouldnt bother with the subscription thing unless you really think you want it and play the game enough to warrant it. I feel like Bethesda hasn't done enough to make it worth it. If course it's a fine line where they should make it worth it but still make you feel like you really dont need it. I do wonder about the unlimited stash thing. As I play if that ends up becoming a problem that will piss me off a little. Hiwever hopefully it wont be that big of a deal.

37,Fallout 76,67430557,english,"An interesting alternative to FO4 that places a greater emphasis on Survival and MMO-esque mechanics.
Notable mechanics include:
Hunger, Thirst and Disease - Simple to manage, never obnoxious. A solid step above FO4's survival in the implementation but that's not saying much. You'll generally be crafting better foods and drinks in order to manage radiation and minimize/avoid disease. Fresh food and drink are perishable, so pre-war snacks and purified water are valuable to keep for the long-term if you run out of whatever you've grown or cooked.
PvE World Events - Repeating and rewarding content that challenges the player. Advisably done with groups, but some can be soloed well enough. I haven't experienced the late game ones that are more boss-focused so I can't report on how those feel.
PvP - I've little experience with this so I cannot comment on how the netcode fares. Unlikely to be your draw, but if it is then there you go.
C.A.M.P.s - Player settlements - an arguably integral mechanic of FO76. You can place them anywhere that isn't specifically a map-marked location, and whilst the tools aren't as entirely robust as FO4's, they're a lot cleaner to use. You'll be dumping your resources here, crafting/upgrading/repairing gear and generally quite regularly visiting wherever you choose to settle down - fast traveling here is free. If you need to, moving is rather easy due to the blueprint system allowing you to more or less 'copy+paste' a building you've created.

Past those, I'll provide basic thoughts on the two most notable factors you may care about:
Combat - It feels roughly about the same as FO4, which is a strong point for it. Gunplay is comfortably simple outside of point-blank range where you may question the accuracy of the crosshair, and melee combat is hefty enough in how it feels. For V.A.T.S., they've turned the mechanic into a time slow that retains the same % hit mechanics from earlier titles but without pausing the action - you can still move whilst using it - and it ultimately feels better and more responsive than FO3/NV/4's implementation by miles.
Story - At 9 hours in I haven't particularly delved deep, but from what I've experienced so far I can say the writing already rubs me better than FO4's or Skyrim's did. With a split between the traditional NPCs and the infamous 'holotape hunts' of the initial release, the lore's kept me fairly involved without feeling particularly lost. The VAs do it all enough justice that I never felt it was a slog listening to holotapes or NPCs.

Additional notes:
Music - The radios are good as ever, whilst the variety of songs isn't much more than previous titles the selection makes up enough for it, and with 2/3 of my time spent listening it's yet to reach a point that I feel I've 'heard that one song too many times'. You'll recognize a fair few songs from FO3 and FO4.
Leveled Equipment - Similar to MMO fare, you won't be wearing Enclave X-01 in the first few levels should you somehow manage to get your hands on a suit. The crafting system allows you craft most equipment in a level appropriate to you, with certain gear having a minimum level tier; levels are 1, 5, 10, 15 and so on until 50. This means if you want to use, for example, Raider Power Armour at level 45 then you're free to do so as you did at level 15 - so long as you either craft it yourself, find the appropriately leveled gear in the world or purchase it from another player running a shop.
Economy - I've so little experience in this that I can't comment much on it, but from what I've seen the game supports a player economy. You can set up vending machines in your camp that function as automated merchants for other players, selling anything from bulk resources to crafted arms and armours.

Final thoughts:
Compared to initial reviews I'd seen of the title that turned me off from buying it last year, the game has seemingly made a remarkable turnaround. I'm in as deep as any previous Bethesda title.",1587042162,1587042162,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,389,5,21053,669,581,1602003780

No matter what you thought about Fallout 76 when it first released (Ive been playing since the beta), one cant deny that they have been busting their ass since day 1 to improve the game. They listened to player feedback (most of the time) and have correctly nearly all the mistakes they made before release. To call this a ""No Mans Sky"" story would be an understatement.

Whats changed since the last time your favorite YouTuber played over a year ago and still uses that experience to judge the game to this very day:

-Most bugs are fixed
-Graphics have been severely overhauled
-Performance has been significantly improved
-Theres NPCs, 2 main quest lines, tons of side quests, thousands of activities, a near limitless amount of content to explore
-The player count is amazingly high, and much of that player count is very friendly towards each other and especially newbies

I dont want to speak too much on Wastelanders in general because I am afraid of spoiling it for those who havent gotten a chance to play. Has this game gotten better? Hell yes. Is this game worth playing today? Very much yes.

As much as I may get memed on for this, the game is much better with Fallout 1st.

53,Fallout 76,67421681,english,"Yes I recommend Fallout 76, but please read the entire review before you decide to buy!!
Fallout 76 has everything you are hoping for in the next Fallout series, but some moron at Bethesda ruined it by turning it into a money pit in order to have a true first person experience. When you buy the game you only get to play the game on a server with other players live. The game encourages team work and socialization with other players. The problem is this ruined the game. Every other Fallout game allowed players in single player mode to immerse themselves into a deep story. To explore and experience an epic adventure at their own pace. Fallout 76 forces you to try to do that while 30 other people are trying to do that in the same game at the same time. This has its good points and bad points, but this is not why anyone enjoyed any of the other Fallout series IMHO.
After you buy the game you then find out that Bethesda created an upgrade feature called ""Fallout 1st""which will allow you to have the true 1st person experience alone in your own Fallout 76 game, but you must either pay $12.99 a month or $99.99 a year to upgrade the game you just paid $59.99 for to allow the actual first person experience in your own server... alone. 
I wanted to know if there was a major difference between the basic Fallout76 experience live with other players or the ""Fallout 1st"" alone on your own server so I did in fact upgrade to the Fallout 1st. The Fallout76 with the Fallout 1st upgrade is exactly what we all wanted the Fallout 76 game to be. The interaction with the story and characters is more how they should be. Bethesda should simply allow players to play live in multiplayer if they want or have their own single player experience for the same purchase price.

First: Graphics, and Menus 

Both of those hopes were shattered within seconds. When I first loaded up the game it was locked to 40 fps. I had to look up how to fix this. Next, I had to figure out graphic settings. Their options are horrible. Not only do you need to restart for any type of change, including window type change. The worst thing about their settings, is the lack of Anti Aliasing. There is no where in the setting that you can change it. You need to go into the .ini file to change it. Maybe worse then the Anti Aliasing issue, what the fact that the sliders didn't slide. 

Second: Gameplay

The sensitivity is wonky, and isn't easily well selected. The way it is hard to do anything when you first start. The way it throws you in expecting to know what you're doing. All of these ruined the experince more.

62,Fallout 76,67412128,english,"[h1]I Hated the Whole Idea of Fallout 76[/h1]

I've been a Fallout fan for a long time. I played the original games when they first came out. I enjoyed Fallout 3 and 4. 

I was extremely upset when Bethesda announced Fallout 76 was going to be multiplayer. I hated the idea that there would be no NPCs. I hated the idea that a series I had always enjoyed as a solo experience was going to have other players thrown into the mix.

So I sat on the side-lines for the past year and half, resigned to the idea that this would be the first Fallout in a long time that I wouldn't play or experience. Then I heard they would be introducing living NPCs and guests into the game with the Wastelanders update. So I finally gave in and decided I would try it. 

I went into Fallout 76 very reluctantly, with low expectations. But as you can see, this is a positive recommendation, and here is why:

[h1]Positives[/h1]
1. [b]You truly can have a SOLO experience.[/b] The map is about 4 times larger than the map in Fallout 4, and there are only 24 players allowed per world. Some of those people are partnered up, some are just running vendor stores. It all adds up to the fact that I can go 30 minutes to an hour without encountering another player, and by ""encounter' I mean I see them run by in the distance, or hear a gun fight in a building down the street. 

2. [b]The level of voice acting and writing in Fallout 76 is vastly superior to Fallout 4.[/b] This surprised me the most. I expected the same level of writing and quality I had experienced in Fallout 4 (which I thought was pretty good). But Fallout 76's audio tapes and console text are on another level. I'm guessing the lack of NPCs when the game launched forced them to up their game in this department, and they really, really did.

3. [b]Much more care seems have been taken with the environments in Fallout 76 than Fallout 4.[/b] They have a level of detail and thought put into them such that every place feels real and lived in, in a way that only the most important locations in Fallout 4 did.  Again, I'm guessing the lack of NPCs on launch was partially responsible for this too - every building had to tell its own story through context and setting. Really, this a level of environmental design we haven't seen since Fallout: New Vegas.

4. [b]The leveling up and progression system is a lot of fun.[/b] By having all your SPECIAL stats start at 1, you get a true sense of progression and you really do feel significantly more of a difference after a level up than you did in Fallout 4. The Perk Card system feels fresh, and scratches the itch of having to make important choices, but also allowing you to swap perks out as you desire for different situations. I thought this would make a Fallout 76 character feel more generic than a Fallout 4 character, but instead it is the opposite. The semi-random nature of the Perk Cards has encouraged me to try out and enjoy playstyles I ignored in other Fallout games.

5. [b]It turns out having other players in the post-apocalypse can be fun and not detract from the feeling of the end times.[/b] Even though I am a solo player and hated the idea of a multiplayer Fallout, in practice, it has been pretty interesting. 

About 2 hours into my time in Fallout 76, another player tried to rob me. I was immediately annoyed at having my solo experience interrupted, but then realized the other player was robbing me [i]in character[/i]. After a brief exchange (all emotes on my side), they ran off, and I realized that functionally, the encounter was no different than if a scripted, voiced NPC bandit had tried to rob me in Fallout 4, except BETTER, because this one was powered by a human who adapted on the fly to how I was responding.

And seeing what other players build as far as camps and vendor stores is amazing. I always built elaborate settlements in Fallout 4, and I can do the same in Fallout 76, except now, I realize, other people can see and appreciate my efforts. 

[h1] Negatives [/h1]
1. [b]The Atom Shop.[/b]  I don't like it on principle, but most of what it sells IS cosmetic only, and even though Bethesda sells Atom points (the currency the store uses) they also give away Atom points like crazy in the game. With normal playtime, I think most people will earn enough Atoms to buy 2 or 3 things a month from the Atom Shop, and there isn't a huge amount there anyway. 

2. [b]There are bugs.[/b] All the ones I've encountered have been minor, but they are there. Occassionally enemies will just freeze in middair, or their AI will not recognize you or react until far too late. But none of these have been bad enough to ruin my enjoyment.

3. [b]The lack of paused time is a double-edged sword.[/b] On the one hand, I really miss being able to slow down or freeze time with VATS, to study a situation or react. But the VATS system in Fallout 76 is a surpisingly good substitute. I also simultaneously hate and like that time no longer freezes when I am on my Pipboy, or reading a note, or building my camp. It adds real tension and drama to the game and makes reading notes in a bombed out building crawling with enemies feel appropriately stressful, but it also means I am sometimes skimming the text because I am afraid a ghoul is running up behind me.

[h1]Final Verdict[/h1]
If, like myself, you are a longtime Fallout fan who was on the fence or even hated the idea of this game - I say give it a chance. It is much more of the Fallout you already love, with new lore, new creatures, and new locations, all of it done to an even better degree than Fallout 4.",1587015590,1587015590,TRUE,1762,145,0.8081038,128,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,550,6,15923,0,553,1591316181
63,Fallout 76,67412101,english,"Thought to give this game a chance despite the negative reviews, glad I did.

Most of the negative feedback seems to focus on Bethesda's practices rather than the game itself, which does not help me as I care very little of matters that are outside of the game.
 
Transactions are my biggest gripes on this game thus far, but it is mostly a non-issue for me since I don't plan on using the store.

Positives:
[list]
[*]Runs very well on my dated rig.
[*]I have not encountered a single bug so far.
[*]Being a multiplayer game some elements are scaled back but on the whole it plays like Fallout 4.
[*]The survival aspects are there but are not as annoying as I thought they would be.
[*]In-game community is pretty laid back.
[*]You can play this game solo, playing with others is optional (Similar to the Dark Soul series coop)

Negatives:

    [*]Movement seems slightly floaty/delayed
    [*]Day/Night cycles are too fast for my taste. (I became used to FO4)

Still I only give it a 8/10 because you have to pay to get your own server and the game would be just fine if hackers weren't ruining immersion by dropping government resupply crates next to you every 2 minutes. There is also a problem with turrets at your base, they shoot eachother and at your base randomly wasting resources and just giving me a headache with the constant shooting. I am sure this will be fixed soon. This never happened on the PS4. There aren't hackers on PS4 this game or others. So in the future you have an issue with them, move to console. I know That is not a good for gaming but GTA was playable on PS4 and unplayable on PC, sooo 

People will tell you that New Vegas is best or Fallout 3 or 4 is better and they are right but just because the first one of something was epic doesn't mean you can't enjoy the new version of it.

Might be your cup of tea, might not, but don't ruin it for people who might actually enjoy the game just because Bethesda fucked it up at the beginning.

This isn't a single player game, yes you can play it alone, but it shines when you're playing with your friends. Yes there's a paywall for some really cool cosmetics, but you get atoms for completing challenges. I got around 800 yesterday in around 10 hours of playtime, it'll probably slow down as time goes, but you can get really cool stuff for free in the atom shop. The graphics aren't insane, you're not going to be blown away, but there are some time's where you'' find yourself saying damn that's pretty. Nuclear Winter (Battle Royal) is decent, I played a game and it seemed alright, its a side mode and if you're into it you can get countless hours of rewards in it looks like. THE HOME CUSTOMIZATION IS SO FUN, when I found myself getting into it, I looked at the time and I wasted 2 hours just trying to make the perfect house for the moment. 

TL;DR

-It's an MMO like game, and its 2020, of course there's cosmetic items you pay for. 
-$12 to have a private server sucks, but you dont even need one, I haven't had any issues in normal lobbies.
-Base building is awesome!
-NPC's are a great addition and make it more player friendly, I felt more involved in the story.
-Nuclear Winter is decent, could put a lot of hours into it.
-It's a Bethesda game, there's glitches, none have made me mad at all.
-Playing with friends makes it so much more enjoyable.

(though im bit miffed that like best house customization , if you want to make your house look bit modern, is paywalled but you can earn ingame atoms and buy it that way). 
I did not played the game before NPCs, but in it's current state, i found quests to be fun and interesting. The best thing however is dialouge choices. Gone shitty fl4 choices (yes, yes , no , sarcastic yes). Now, if you have enough charisma , you can avoid combat or trick npcs and stuff like that, something that was dearly missed. The face animations on npcs are bit janky, but what did u expect from creation engine. The graphics looks goods enough (I only see few low res textures, the whole graphics problem is over exaggerated and it runs extremly well for me at least.
The multiplayer is not that bad as well. I found i would barely meet any people during my playtrough and when i did, it again, wasn't intrusive. I have to say, it's pretty cool to come across someones camp and seeying their houses and stuff. Most , if not, all indoor areas are solo only anyway (meaning you can only meet other people in outside/freeroam areas). Again, if you worried about that, don't be.
Maybe the game sucked before npc update (okay, not maybe , it did) but IMO this is better than fallout 4 at this point but not better than fallout new vegas.... BIG IRON.

Fallout 76 Wastelanders is a pleasant surprise. I was expecting some tacked on settlers but instead got some really interesting new characters and and a better introduction to 76. Everyone else can keep dwelling in the past with Bethesda's mistakes but this is a breath of fresh air for Fallout 76.

The game actually runs well now when back then it would barely run in high end PC's (minus a few stutters here and there but not too impacting). The introduction upon leaving the Vault flows much better than just listening to Holotapes. But what makes this such a better game, is the settlers and raiders. The few early characters you meet are quite likable and personally I enjoyed listening to their stories (Mort especially because he acts like a discount Nathan Fillion and I fucking love it).
The raiders are especially a nice addition to the online environment. They actually give me a reason to be more cautious out in the Wastes when travelling alone.
It's also nice to see that there are not as many game breaking bugs anymore, however some do persist but aren't as bad as launch and even from then on.

I like to think since they added NPCs its become much much better.
   -There is plenty to do
   -Map is vast and unique
   -Fairly wide variety of builds, PvE & PvP
   -Endgame Goals (could be more tbh)
   -Odd UI/controls, with bulky feel in a few situations.
   -Microtransactions are moderate (ESO is far worse price wise)
   -Motionblur/depth is a pain, no option to remove motionblur, which is kinda crazy now-a-days
   -Lots of relaxing things to do, CAMP building is honestly relaxing af
   -PvP might be a constant aspect, but can easily be avoided and not forced onto you, which is nice.
   -Not really a point, but easily 60-70% of the negative reviews up till now are just activating crossplay from the other launcher and crying over here. Kinda crazy how fast they were.

-----------------------------------------
Fallout 76 Wastelanders is a great step in the right direction. Its NOT the perfect ""fix"" for Fo76 or even a perfect expansion to the game. But it is a very well made expansion and a really good step into attempting to revive this game, and make it what it should've been at launch( A multiplayer Fallout experience).

I haven't beat or even came close to completing Wastelanders yet so this is more of a first impressions of the game instead of a review. But so far the story of Wastelanders is very good (*IN MY OPINION*), and it fixes alot of bugs/issues the game had before the update. The expansion also works well for new players who haven't played Fo76 yet so you dont have to worry about not having a leveled up player. In my personal opinion i believe the game would be more fun with a fresh player (and that is what i did) to go through the game again and experience all the changes to the base story and the new Wastelanders story. The base story still isn't the best and i wouldnt even dare to say good. But the changes they made to it make it playable and enjoyable at times. And the new Wastelanders story like i stated before is VERY good from what i have played so far.


I would 100% recommend Wastelanders to anyone who hasn't played Fo76 and enjoys the Fallout franchise, or anyone who gave up on 76 awhile ago. It's only $40 so at least you dont have to pay the full $60, and i think you would be pleasantly surprised with how the game is now compared to how the game was before.",1586917843,1586917843,TRUE,21,5,0.289813697,0,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,77,4,3318,4,581,1602028637
18,Fallout 76,67335715,english,"I think the majority of negative reviews are from people that played this at launch and do not like the DLC and in-game shop. The DLC issue of having to pay for a private server doesn't seem outrageous to me, and the in-game shop uses 'atoms' which you can gain by doing challenges.

While 76 doesn't do everything perfectly, it is fun, and seeing other people is interesting at times depending on what they are wearing. VATS is drastically different since it does not slow time; you choose where to hit and fire when the percentage is to your liking. Dialogue choices are more like 3/NV than 4 with many choices and optional dialog based on your stats. Multiplayer events can be fun also, like protecting a NPC or killing animals.

Other areas in which 76 differs from earlier games is that food and water seems to be more important, caps are far less common and items sell for a pittance (a 10MM gun sells for 2 caps), there are instances based on level (found a lvl 50 area), and you can run into some really powerful enemies rather than deathclaws being the only deadly creature.

Putting any hatred for bethesda aside, Fallout 76 is not the terrible, massive piece of shit that others in the review section would have you believe. It's simply fallen victim to todays toxic gaming culture. 

Is FO76 a great game? Honestly no, it's clearly not a head turner. Is FO76 the worst pile of shit? Definitely not. FO76 is simply a game that bethesda took a chance on with trying something a bit different, and whether those risks are something you are interested in or not, I think it's important to allow developers the breathing room to take risks and make the games that they want instead of what we want. Otherwise we end up with a never ending loop of the same old shit.

FO76 is not a Fallout 5. Its not Fallout 4 co op. It's simply a game that has been made in a way that only a niche group of people are going to enjoy. FO76 is survival / crafting lite with some fallout elements, lore and atmosphere.

So the big question out of the way: Does Wastelanders make FO76 worth returning to / is FO76 Worth playing now?
This is a complicated question. Is Fallout 76 a more polished experience? Yes, though there are still performance issues and some non game breaking bugs. There is still jank for sure. If you absolutely despised FO76 before and could not stand the core game loop, I don't think this new patch is going to pull you in. Now if you saw potential in the original release but desired some more content and polish, then I think yes, Wastelanders will probably be able to draw you in and provide a lot more hours of enjoyment out of the title. 

People who will like Fallout 76 are people that:

-Enjoyed the exploration / combat / character leveling and looting of bethesda games more than they cared about the story. (i'm the guy that pretty much ignores the story in ES/FO and just plunders and explores the entire map)

-Find enjoyment in survival / crafting games. FO76 is 100% not even close to games like ARK, Minecraft, Conan Exiles, Rust, etc, in terms of these mechanics, but in some ways these mechanics are still very much a part of the game loop. If you enjoyed the above games, like fallout and don't mind a slightly lighter implementation of these mechanics then you will almost definitely enjoy FO76.

- Can cope with a decent amount of bugs and jank. Again, people that are familiar with and enjoy the games mentioned above are probably used to this. 

- Enjoy chill exploration and building.

People that will not like FO76 are people that:

-Are looking for a deep pvp experience. Killing other players / dying has little reward or consequence in FO76. Honestly the PVP feels like its simply there just to say its there. Dying has next to no downside and you don't get much for player killing. I've actually never been PK'd and most people are really nice.

- Are looking for a deep narative driven RPG experience. If this is what you want, just go back to your library or store page, because this is 100% not what you are looking for. 

- Are actively turned off by any crafting or survival elements in a game no matter how lite they are. 

- Need the utmost level of polish. You simply will not find that here.

- Are looking for a core single player fallout experience. Nope, just nope.",1586917333,1586917333,TRUE,3,1,0.496031761,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,213,31,790,0,93,1588727386

I made fun of FO76 when Bethesda was launching it originally, the jokes of the bag, the helmet, the crappy whiskey thing. I think a lot of the hate and jokes FO76 got was deserved between their terrible launch client, poor handling of customer support, unjust bans, etc. 

That said - reviewing the newly launched Steam/Wastelanders expansion. I'm fine with this purchase. While I can see the argument to get this on sale vs full price, I don't even mind paying full price atm, there's been crap all games to play recently and having finally taken a look at FO76 for myself - yes it is like MP Fallout 4....but that's exactly the reason I stopped playing Fallout 4, I WANTED to be able to play that with a friend or two. 

I think it's a bit crap that there are so many microtransactions inside FO76, but they honestly don't feel forced outside of the Fallout 1st if you want a private session with friends. 

I've laid more than my share of hate on a LOT of games, but I honestly feel like (7~ hours in) most of what I've read on Fallout 76 was random bandwagon hate train, or it was either because of the lack of NPCs/Quests or Bugs and that seems to be resolved or in a better place.

50,Fallout 76,67295092,english,"So after reaching level 10, I think I have reached a consensus.

[h1] The Good [/h1]

1) Beautiful atmosphere

2) The photo taking feature is actually a lot of fun and very easy to use

3) Combat feels fluid and engaging

4) C.A.M.P is pretty entertaining to decorate and customize

5) If you played Fallout 4, then you should be very comfortable with the layout for 76

6) Hunger & Thirst system; craft food to stay in tip-top shape

7) Weapon modding parts are relatively easy to come by and craft

8) You can create a vendor for players to trade caps for your listed items

[h1] The Bad [/h1]

1) After I left the initial spawn point where a handful of players were, I had a brief encounter with one player and then heard distant gunshots from another while soloing a quest. Apart from that, there were no other player to player interactions

2) The player size for servers seems to small. It feels like I'm playing on a LAN with some buddies rather than playing in an 'MMO'.

3) Events seem dead. It could just be the server I was on, but I went to attend multiple serverwide events and no players showed up other than myself. The lackluster of cooperation makes this game feel empty

4) The story and dialogue is mundane and I could care less about it. I skip almost all dialogue scenes as they are really all just a waste of time and drag on for too long.

5) There is no ""team up"" or party queue feature. If you run into a player you can invite them to your party, but if you go off as a solo wanderer, you have to track down random players on the map  and hope that once you reach them they will party with you. The game seems to rely solely on if you have a buddy to play with.

6) The game offers no hardcore features. I don't see why there couldn't be servers available that have PvP enabled at all times rather than having to both engage with each other to enable PvP. It's basically a dueling system like Borderlands - good in theory, but how many times are you actually going to use the feature?

7) Fast travel points are only areas you have claimed. That would be fine if it weren't for the fact that your AP rapidly goes down sprinting so you're forced to walk back and forth between target locations to retrieve items or go kill a radroach a few miles away. Vehicles/transportation would be nice, and if not just fast travel wherever I need to go.

[h1] The Ugly [/h1]

1) Battle royale. I could see where they were going with this - instead of making the base game more engaging with players, they wanted to keep it strictly cooperative and add a second gamemode that is a fight to the death wasteland arena. It just doesn't work and they could have spent their time and resources elsewhere.

2) Bugs. There's still a few of them, the main one for me being rendering of the server map. I will often be traveling from one location to the next and upon arriving at my destination the terrain and buildings have not rendered in and I run into invisible obstacles and get attacked by invisible enemies. I know this is not an internet issue, I have great internet connection and am connected to ethernet. I can also clearly see my health dipping as I'm being attacked and can still interact with everything. My guess is it's a server issue.

3) The Atomic store? All of the items in the atomic store are simply not worth it and overpriced. Apparel offered in the atomic store looks worse than what I've found just playing the game so I don't know why they think I would want to take my credit card out for these offers.

[h1] Consensus [/h1]

I really wanted to leave a thumbs up for this, but I don't really think it's worth the $40 in its state. The game by all means is not bad, but there are so many areas of improvement and growth for this game and it hasn't reached the bar.

I'm very thankful for the Wastelanders update, it adds much needed life to 76. Also having the old style of character lines is awesome! Playing a new character now feels much more like a Fallout game than when I did over a year ago on the PS4.

When the game first came out, there were problems, big problems. It was poorly optimized, the mechanics were buggy (hay its fallout, that happens) and the game itself crashed now and then. 

Fast forward to today and although there are some bugs left they have made huge fixes and it is a good game!!! Come on guys, it is. 

Full disclosure I own all the fallout games on one platform or another and very much enjoy them... apart from fallout tactics, that sucked. 

If you give this game a try you will find a huge world, build mechanics which are actually a lot more fun than you would expect, a decent trade system, lots of interesting quests, lore, story's and every now and then mothra. 

So people who are giving reviews based on old info, or people who have got the free copy through account linking and just want to bomb the game (no joke intended) please try posting reviews based on the game itself as it is NOW and not on what you A, remember for ages ago or B what other people have said.... this is steam, not mumsnet. 

If I had to give one tip: 

Conserve ammo, this is not fallout 4, lots of led can be found in the gym at the fire station in the ash zone which keeps coming back so use it to make ammo. Its pointless using up a heap of ammo when you don’t need to.

88,Fallout 76,67313609,english,"Okay--- I wish we could have nice things like informative and constructive reviews. That's not going to happen here in general for FO76 on Steam...at least not for a while. 

FYI, before I give my review I want to address the flood of spite in the review section. There's two kinds of negative reviews you're seeing right now: the first are people trolling due to Bethesda's past unsavory practices and lies (or just to pile on, becuase hey, why not beat that dead and buried horse), while the second are players having issues with Steam and the optimization of the game for this platform. While I agree with a lot of the prior complaints, downvoting Wastelanders to get back at Bethesda is just silly at this juncture and not really contributing anything to the conversation--- I'm honestly just ignoring those diatribes, and suggest you do so as well. The people having issues  with the Steam port are the ones I have complete sympathy for, and hope access and optimization issues get addressed. Still, I have not experienced any of those issues, and I'm running Steam on a Shadow gaming virtual machine halfway across the country. Maybe luck or not but I'm pulling 70+fps and not experiencing the other noted performance  issues.

Now, as for the game itself, I came back from beta and have been playing for several months...and have really enjoyed the experience. Wastelanders so far reminds me most of Fallout 4 (I've played all the iterations of Fallout), which I liked (even if I found NV better as a game overall), and some of the enemies have also toughened up a bit. The game had already evolved from its troubled start, and was something I already played regularly before Wastelanders. If you like exploring, camp building, a touch of horror with the occasional fight mixed in, this may be the game for you. My hope is that this is just the next step in the continued evolution for the game. We'll see how it goes and if the game can overcome the prior stigma attached to it.
