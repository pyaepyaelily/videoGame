Another game with NO tutorials. Wiki is crap as well.
How any one was supposed to learn this games functions with out youtube is beyond me.
Many years Of modding/logic/Code saved me in the end. But this is just tedious. 

 In game functions like wiring are clunky and slow.
Want to test a circuit? Build the vessel, jump aboard test, doesn't work? Jump back to work bench and try again.
And again and again and again and again and again and again..... buoyancy is broke on certain wedges. I Figured this out just to lose hours of work. FUN!
Give me a way to test functions in the darn build menu and stop wasting my time. Like wiring. Or buoyancy. And aerodynamics.

Also physics? Why do I hear boss music?! Holy CRAP BATMAN! There goes my ship flying into the blue sky.
I want to tow this ship faster than 5 m/s. NOPE! So long big ugly! You want to tie something? Nope!
You want a simple game that just works? NOPE! Another update with more missions/items.

How about a Diesel Electric system that doesn't need 4 engines to run a single generator. Yes I'm using gearboxes.
Or a gen that doesn't cause so much drag when there is no draw on it..... 

Or the worst part, I cant even Play this game with out it dying on me. When I first launch, the game is fine max settings, I'm  getting about 190fps. Then in about 30 or so minutes 30FPS???? Drivers updated? Nope... Reload the game fixes it. 
But gets pretty tiring after a while. 

The dedicated software and admin system is a joke. Not gonna go into that. But this game is releasing in a month?
Oh boy they got a lot of fixing to do. I hope they fix this on release. I'm not very hopeful. 

I could go on and on. But rant done.
 Pass Unless on sale, Will update if things are fixed.

Update 1.0

Oh my GAWD Please kill me. You could actually make it worse?!
I crash almost every 20 minutes now. The missions are even more boring.
Ropes are like bungee cords? Lock/connectors are.... Well kinda there? Maybe? Sometimes?
Nope not even close. This is now a released game that feels rushed, or incomplete. 

Hey Story time!
Friend, and I say hey lets give this game another chance. Well mainly me.....
Sets up a server. OK. That was easy enough. Hmm, tries to do the tutorial.........
We both lose sync with the server pings out at 2500ms? OK
Try again. Same thing. Sigh. Finds out that every time I put the fire out it starts to crash?
OK removes the tutorial. That works Let try some missions. YEAH!
Every mission is to far away, or needs other equipment. Sigh. I end up cheating so We are not on the starter Island, Just so we can do some something. Spent two and a halve hours just bug shooting, And sleeping in game just waiting to do 2 missions. Fun.

There is something to this game I like. I just wish it didn't fight me tooth, and nail to play it.
I played this game on two different Operating systems, 7 & 10 no luck.

[strike]Why did I down vote this MASTER PIECE of a game?[/strike]

[b]One[/b] simple reason. the devs are convinced [b]32bit[/b] is the [u]way[/u] to go. -_- yes that's right this is [u]not[/u] a 64bit game and will work on legacy machines to a small extent. But the future looks grim.  Please oh please devs get with the times and don't abandon this art to the old technologies of the 90s. 

P.S. The moment the devs wake up and support 64bit im rating this baby UP!!!!!! XD XD XD XD XD

Even if you want to play it with ""simple"" mode you're still gonna encounter very annoying bugs (which ultimately tilted me and are the reason of review), those are broken fullscreen mode (mouse disappearing, black screenshots), blocks falling through terrain, unability to rotate pipes (they will lock up in some random position)

devs rushed for 1.0 release, bumped up price and fixed bugs which were least common ones. Game is fun but only for 100-150 hours which isn't that much for a sandbox game, and especially not much for this game's potential

game so far:
undemanding and atmospheric graphics (kinda bad lights tho)
kinda lacking cpu optimization, but overall it's undemanding so you don't see it often if at all
a lot of content to discover, learn, go through
bugs which will make it a bumpy ride
ok sounds
many missions and secondary duties give purpose to playing and building things

will change review to positive when devs either fix bugs or rework power system",1601815022,1601815022,False,2,0,0.465020745992660522,0,True,True,False,76561198118178281,71,2,13845,300,13806,1601844209,,

First opinion was made when i had 95 hours , but i wanted to add more
i mean the game overall is the best game , Not the game we wanted , but the game we needed
the game is cool i mean like 11/10
might be hard to run on potatoes but my lenovo i3 5 something ran the game on 60 fps on lowest settings
bruh maybe 50 tho ngl

i recommend the game full price.

whats good in the game you ask me?
well yes.
in there you can build your own boat , ship , train , helicopter and a jet or something
yeah theres carreer , creative , hardcore ( minecraft flashbacks ) and more
theres working voice chat
fxcked up multiplayer but still
water physics but no physics
eh and theres more but i dont remember

whats bad in the game you think?
The fxcking updates are out per 1 or 2 weeks
the devs are lazy fxcks and the updates are like : Today we give you players 10 more rope types
i mean bruh come on
theres main lands that were build in 6 months
YOU STILL CAN FXCKING WALK THROUGH THE TEXTURES
the game is in early development for 3 years
there are bugs that devs dont give a fxck
there was once a bug that is 4 months old
game is badly optimized
lighting removes for you around 20 fps
bullshxt game engine and render engine
game engine is totally fxcked up , i dont understand how devs dont regret that
game engine is Bullet for physics if anyone wanted to know
( im saying again , the game was released fxcking 3 years ago )


but still the game is good enough to play with a friend
i remember joking in OFFICAL stormworks discord server 
like that one guy said:
The next update is gonna be sponsored by Raid: Shadow Legends
XDDDDD
we were like complaining about what devs did and all
and the devs were like:
eh , too lazy to do anything
i remember how the devs forgot to remove one tool from the game editor or something and there was a floating ball in the air
bruh come on its not that hard to remove a tool

overall devs are lazy fxggots and dont care about people
they add updates whatever the fxck they want

30,76141455,english,"This 1.0 update has basically destroyed all the great things this game had to offer. I can not recommend buying this game, especially not at an increased price!

They removed key components that allowed for rich progression in career mode. New island generation turns a big wide open procedural and explorable world into a 100km x 125km mostly predefined box. Also removed a brilliant dynamic mission editor and spawner.

**Update**
Old Career mode with research and tech tree has been added back into the game. And a new 'test' button has been added to the new lua heavy mission spawner which allows you to forcibly spawn in a single mission without having to use a lua code. These are good steps but the game still has a lot of problems. The old mission editor and spawner was much better, it even allowed you to pick from vanilla missions to play which this new editor can not. You should't have to learn a programming language to access content that was already in the game. Also all the old missions from before the version 1 update were removed, they were super fun and less hardcore. The new first person body system is a great idea but trying to swim with the new physics of this body is a pain, you are constantly below the surface of the water and it is hard to see where you are going. The island generation is still very much predefined and islands stop spawning after a certain distance, unlike the pre-v1 version of the game.",1600380187,1601562167,False,41,1,0.636461973190307617,1,True,False,False,76561197977593356,159,12,19016,271,18978,1601593493,,

______________________
By sandbox I mean a literal sandbox

Before I played the game | 4/10 stars
After I played the game | 9/10 stars
_______________________
To be honest. there are somethings wrong with it,
1. You have to have a good computer
2. They took out simple mode
_______________________

I am not paid to write this review,
If you like Sandboxes, this is the game for you.


I hope you enjoy this game as much as I did.
______________________
What I really like about it.
I LOVE to code, I really like how its a challenge
and you can program, I love this game because I
build really cool stuff, I like how its multiplayer,
before playing this game and watching a youtuber
play it, I use to be sad, and bullied because I have
ADHD, after I got it, I would hop on and I would let
my creativity flow, I felt relaxed and I felt accomplished,
so in a way this game has helped me, it has helped me
become smarter and more relaxed.

Given how quickly and openly the developers have been about handling these issues, I've decided that this game is back on my Recommended list. There's positive changes afoot, and I'd hate for people to miss out on them.

UPDATE, September 26, 2020:
Well I sure didn't expect to have to amend this review after only 8 days, but here we are!

And what do you know, the developers are listening, and making adjustments accordingly.

Key Points: Classic Career Mode and the research tree are back! Hooray! I have a game mode that gives me the sense of progression I made such a big deal about in the first iteration of this review. This makes me happy, as this, I believe, was the biggest issue that stuck out. As of now, there are people reporting that automatic mission spawning in Classic Career mode, which I did notice as well. I'm hoping this will be sorted out in a patch or two.

Custom Mission Spawning Without Coding is......sort of back. Per the dev's patch notes, they added a ""Test Location"" button, which immediately spawns you into the custom mission scenario. This is alright, but there still isn't a convenient list of scenarios and missions you can readily choose from, and immediately set as active, as there was before. There's just a list that allows you to dictate which missions are in the rotation when you create a new game.

I will maintain that going into the Map screen, clicking a ""Missions"" button, and being able to view active missions right there, see their time limits right there, and choose specifically what mission, including a custom one, that you wanna load up, was far far more convenient than the Lua route.

Bugfixes and Improving Hose Mechanics, always nice, not much more to say.

I really hope this positive trend continues, and that these concerns continue to be addressed. I'm in a much more positive mindset about the game now, because of the developers showing a desire to listen to concerns, and having a vested interest in keeping players happy. Just keep it up, guys! You're on the right track!


ORIGINAL REVIEW, September 18, 2020 (Not Recommended):
I speak as a person who has sunk hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of hours into this game. Literally 2 days ago, this was a game I would've recommended to anyone who loved adventure or open world or sandbox or exploration games. This game had crazy amounts of depth, a sense of progression, an ability to basically create and destroy and explore to your heart's content. Half the fun I had was putting together custom mission scenarios for multiplayer quests. I could lose myself in this game's randomly generated world.

But then Update 1.0 happened.

Now granted, the update had some really cool things, spreadable dynamic fire, a new toolbar for player items, and hoses. But those new features apparently came at a price, and that price was the removal of tech trees and researching new parts, a severe dumbing down of the game's difficulty to where everything feels incredibly linear and career mode basically serves no purpose, but at the same time turning the normal career mode into a one life hardcore mode.

But worst of all, was the ditching of the mission spawner system. You used to be able to create your own custom missions from a menu that was easily accessible from the map screen, which was incredibly convenient, incredibly simple to use, and more importantly, fun. That doesn't exist now, replaced by a requirement to learn the Lua programming language in order to do custom anything anymore.


They got rid of just about every reason I liked the game, and bought the game, in the first place. No sense of progression, no sense of freedom to do what you wish at any time, no randomly generated maps to discover by seed of your own wit, no easy to access custom scenario system, all of it's gone. It doesn't even feel or play like the game I purchased anymore. Hopefully one day, I can rescind this review when the game becomes a challenge again, but right now, it's just a disappointment.",1600413912,1601447223,True,0,0,0.851674795150756836,3,True,False,False,76561198112552497,86,2,10173,102,10042,1601189371,1600778694.0,"Dear Stormworkers,

Thank you for this review and all feedback received. We have reacted to much of the players feedback we have received. We have re-added the classic career mode with research tree and also mission spawning UI buttons:

On 17th Sept, we released version 1.0.

On 20th Sept, we re-added ""Classic Career"" mode back in, with research trees, map fog, player icons, and other settings familiar to the classic career.

On 21st Sept, we added new mission spawning UI without any scripting required. Players can simply load their mission in the mission editor, and click ""Test Location"". This will spawn that location and all contained vehicles immediately into game.

Thank you to all players providing feedback! Keep it coming.

Much love <3,

The Stormworks Developers"

The tutorial is pretty bad - I had to have 3 attempts to get through it as it kept bugging out in one way or another. It also doesn't teach you anything about building a boat - you have to go to YouTube for that. 

Then getting into the game proper, I failed the first rescue because I spent too long building a boat, and then no other missions spawned. I've no idea why.

10,76683790,english,"This game has one of the most intricate, complex and fascinating building systems I've seen.  The editor is great, and the amount of functions that you can add to vehicles are overwhelming.  By far, the best builder I've seen on Steam.

[b]Then, when your masterpiece is done, you have a bunch of repetitive tasks to do and realize what you just built is only useful for getting you from point A to point B to perform said mundane tasks...[/b]  That's why I wouldn't recommend this game to you, unless you're obsessive in your compulsion to create something that will ultimately never amount to much, or are a workshop content creator striving to get more ""likes"" on the thing you've put together.

I won't stop here, because there are a few things that I can think of that would make this game much better - namely, more vanilla variety of missions, actual AI so the game doesn't feel like a completely lifeless spawn-here-spawn-there mess, and maybe an economy beyond just paying for parts you need to have a marginally functional vehicle - there is little that you can do besides ""rescues"" and putting out fires, etc. that doesn't get repetitive over time.

I'll put more time into it and see if things change, updates make it better, etc. and will update my review according to the progress I see - what I'm looking at now, is a supposedly [i]full release[/i] game that has fallen far short of the potential I thought it had over the months I was considering buying it.  They released it too early, made players mad by stripping features (and suddenly putting SOME back in as response to negative feedback; well done I guess?) and ultimately - it still feels like one of those early access games that has about five more steps to go before it's the dream come true it should be.

There are definitely worse games out there, and this is in general not a ""bad"" game because it's strengths somewhat balance out it's weaknesses, but the bottom line is more should have been done for this game before it released, and more is still going to have to be done to this game before it's worth the advertised price.

If you want it?  I suggest you wait for a sale.  If you don't think mastering an ultra-complex building system is for you?

51,76305142,english,"I love and hate this game. I love it because of the building mechanics and the craft and systems you can create in game. I hate it because of the bug ridden world the game is set in and the poorly thought out features and/or implementations.

After almost 300 hours, I've finally created some vehicles I'm actually proud of. Few games can invoke in me authentic feelings of pride, so huge props to Stormworks for that. After all the time it takes creating a structure, filling it with it's required mechanical parts, creating the logic and connecting the systems together, it can be really rewarding to see your creations come to life and operate how you envisioned.

But there's a few problems that are really holding the game back.

Some of the ideas and features in game are good on paper, but the implementation is horrible. A good example is the weather system, which comes complete with wind. I love the idea of wind being a force to be contended with. But the wind in Stormworks is frequently strong enough to blow your craft away from you, making it sometimes impossible to simply get out of your vehicle to do a rescue mission. Even heavy craft with locked landing gear can be blown away. I've also had a few times where I've flown a helicopter full speed into a head wind without being able to gain any ground (and in fact being pushed backwards), making it impossible to reach my destination until the wind dies down or changes direction.

The world that exists in Stormworks is completely devoid of life, with the exception of a few doctors around hospital buildings. The only other people in Stormworks exist only when they are spawned in as part of a mission (people to be rescued). The only other boats, cars or planes you will see are also part of these missions. There are no random NPCs cruising around the oceans, roads or skies, helping to make the world feel alive.

Really inconvenient bugs exist that just confuse me. For instance, you can't swim with a hose in your hand. Pretty big problem for boats that need to be fueled up. Your boats spawn in the water, you have to swim to them to get to them. Your fuel is stored on land. You can't swim with a fuel hose in hand (the hose keeps pulling you back towards whatever it's connected to). So something as simple as putting gas in the gas tank can become an enormous problem and headache.

Character movement is a huge pain. Getting hung up on little lips and edges of structures is common and I'm always having to jump to get over a non-perfectly flat surface. Water tosses your character around like a leaf, making trying to grab a ladder lots of fun when your  swimming in high waves. And clipping through walls sometimes happens, especially when getting out of a pilot seat (instant unintentional vehicle ejection). 

Missions that include putting out a vehicle fire often don't spawn the vehicle, just the fire. So you have to put out a floating ball of fire.

Players sometimes teleports 50 feet in the air when spawning a vehicle, leaving you to free fall back to the ground and take injury. I'm sure dying to this when playing hardcore (save deleted on death) would be a slice.

The 'video tutorials' provided in game open up an external link to youtube, to MrNJersey's page with 4 videos. He does a great job with his tutorials, but as far as I can tell he's not part of the development team. There is no in game tutorial to explain the very in depth systems that are available.

Lighting in dark conditions is comically bad. The hand held flashlight can cast more illumination than the high powered, vehicle mounted spot light, but even it sucks. Facilities like hospitals have next to no exterior illumination. I've been 80m above a hospital in a helicopter at night, and it's pitch black. Literally no indication that a building is there. As an extension of the under powered lighting, night time in this game is a joke. The newly released night vision binoculars help, but the zoom makes them only useful at long ranges. Easy fix would be to add night vision goggles. Or make light sources stronger. Or make ambient light brighter. But nope, stupidly dark conditions is what we have.

It's frustrating. This could be a fantastic game, but it's not. It's almost like if they had 5 employees, 4 were working really hard to make this game great, but 1 was a corporate spy set on sabotaging the game.

If you like building machines and are very patient with development, I am comfortable recommending this game to you. Don't let the 1.0 fool you, it's still very much incomplete and under development.

OLD REVIEW BEFORE THEY MESSED UP THE GAME>
A legendary game that is still under heavy development. It has huge potential. What would happen if Tony Stark was the director of thunderbirds international rescue?

This is not so much a rescue game as a build vehicles game. As usual a vehicle in Stormworks is made up of little blocks and mechanical parts. Except there also needs to be logic connections added in too to make it work. Linking up buttons, engines, dials, throttle control, etc. The list goes on. 

There is even a chance to create complete integrated logic circuits to do calculations or advanced logic functions. If you have no idea of what a PID controller is. Your are about to learn a thing or two. There is even an opportunity to get involved in computer scripting using the Lua programming language. Which give your designs even more advanced features.

At first it looks like you need an engineering degree, but it’s surprisingly simple once the steps are broken down. However mastery takes practice.

Once build you can take the new vehicle out into Stormworks violent weather and attempt rescue missions. The game has a very easy to use inbuilt mission editor. So there will lots of missions on the workshop to add to those already in game. A series of missions forms a campaign. 

With survival mechanics included often a player themselves will need rescued when things wrong. Giving multiplayer opportunity. For multiplayer the in game radio system is amazing. You need to set up a radio transmitter and receiver to talk to the team when separated. That being said the game works perfectly as a single player game.

There also a chance to build new bases in game. These can be introduced as you discover locations in the campaign. Or you could just build bases and have them permanently appear as part of the world. With a workshop to share creations there is plenty to download too.

The catch is of course early access... beware. It is very early and there is going to be issues ahead. This one is going to take time given the complexity of the choices being provided. In game physics are 95% of the way there but can fail sometimes. The good news it there does seem to be a decent attempt build a feedback system to help narrow down technical issues. At some point the developer will have stop adding content to concentrate on smoothing out the whole game. However it is designed from ground up to have endless workshop content.

Thumbs up with early access reservations.",1575412750,1601076227,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197980965158,194,55,26170,561,25776,1601251684,,

In my opinion Stormworks is a game for everyone who likes to build vehicles, drive vehicles and who likes to plan design and mechanics, like connecting engines and propellers (pretty simple example).

Positive things:
[list]
[*]adavanced editor
[*]many blocks and other components
[*]Extensively developed, easy to use logic system, with which you can create user-defined processes to have control over your 
speed, direction etc.
[*]Integrated editor for microcontrollers
[*]Microcontrollers can process inputs and output them again
[*]for advanced users, there are lua scripts in the microcontrollers. With the scripts you can create interactive maps for example
[*]I have to disappoint people with RTX graphic demands. Stormworks is a low poly game. But if you ask me, I think that the low poly graphics fits to the game. It is a game about vehicles and their mechanics and not about the most beautiful vehicles with 		hyper graphics.
[*]Through constantly changing weather (which you can also adjust manually), you can test your vehicles on e.g. tsunamis and strong winds. Furthermore the weather fits very well to the atmosphere.
[*]Stormworks has with Minecraft and Subnautica one of the best soundtracks which varies a lot with bells and gives a sea feeling.
[*]The map on which you play depends on the seed you enter and represents the ocean with several islands. On this map you can play pre-defined missions, most of which involve rescues or transports. Additionally there is a mission editor and a lot of 			different great missions in the Steam Workshop.
[*]The multiplayer of Stormworks is relatively acceptable, but there are some things to improve.
[*]Storworks offers a wide range of vehicles that can be built, such as aircraft, ships, landvehicles and even ""buildings"". Stormworks’ focus however is on boats.
[*]With the 1.0 update, many new and long awaited items have been added, such as fire extinguishers
[*]At the beginning the editor is a bit confusing, but with time you learn new things until you get the full potential out of Stormworks.





Negative things and proposals:

[*]When it comes to performance, Stormworks is simply a joke: If you've spawned several vehicles, for example, the game starts to lag a lot. Although there is a despawning for distant vehicles, Stormworks could make some improvements (One game that does this quite well is Satisfactory (which I know from my own experience)).
[*]The multiplayer could be given some additional features, like a multiplayer editor (I know that the devs have other things to do, but I would really appreciate this feature).
[*]I would also suggest a support for custom blocks (Windows are just pain in Stormworks, when you want them to fit)
[*]In the LUA scripts there is already a simple instruction for the Stormworks API, but you could provide an API documentation.


Conclusion:

[*]Stormworks is a well made game with a focus on building, testing and scenario playing and is for everyone with creativity, fun at building and a little patience.

Therefore Stormworks gets a very good rating.

96,76535553,english,"Building your first boat and putting it to the test against waves, storms, and even tsunamis, just to barely make it back to the dock for further adaptions, will have you swearing like a sailor in no time.

Stormworks is a decent game if you enjoy building vehicles of all kinds, alongside the various systems like electricity, propulsion and all kinds of mechanical as well as logical gadgets and other contraptions.

Classic career mode has been added again, after players disapproved of its removal in 1.0.
It offers the earning of funds and research points, which can be invested in bigger vehicles and more advanced technology to help you get your fleet started.
A custom gamemode allows for testing of various systems without the restrictions of career.

Editors are an essential part in these type of games. Stormworks editor can be learned quickly, offers a search bar, mirror modes on 3 axes and a selection tool helps to copy and paste bigger selections or entire vehicles.

The Logic system is very expansive, from simple logic gates to fully fleshed out LUA controllers or displays, which can be interacted with via in game touchscreen monitors should keep you busy for a long time.

Stormworks features a huge map, all islands are inside a circle with a radius of ~100km, all available from start on. You can buy islands if you got the spare change, to allow building of different vehicles and even outposts.

The mission system has been reworked, they are now randomized across the entire map and of more varying types. Simple passenger transportation, sea rescues or fire missions can appear throughout mission runtime, distances can vary and you will be hard pressed to make it in time.
Players can also freely engage in cargo transportation, which requires a wide range of vehicles to complete.
Fluid trading might be less daunting for inexperienced players and allows you to buy crude oil from oil rigs.
Refineries will purchase the crude oil for a decent profit off you and allow you to buy other fluid types like diesel and jet fuel, which in turn can again be sold at the airport or fishing village.

Mission success depends on proper vehicle choice, equipment, arrival in time and on environmental factors outside your control. Storms can cause high waves which will force you to sail around them if your boat is likely to capsize. With a submarine at your disposal you could dive just through it.
With 1.0 these storms got even stronger, it's now possible to park your vehicles inside hangars, where wind won't blow them off into the sea.

Currently there are some issues with this game, the developers are pushing out updates multiple times in the week post 1.0 release and are responding to player feedback.
For some reason info about stuff in game is hard to come by, engines offer a power rating, with no explanation how or what that number is supposed to mean, while other devices like monitors, lights or heaters don't offer any info about their power consumption.

I'd consider myself as an avid first person player, this game offers plenty of tools to play exclusively in first person, cameras can give you a better sense of your surroundings, while other systems like radar and sonar act as enhancements to your good old Eyeball MkI.

As of now I can recommend this game, with modular engines on the horizon and already plenty of stuff to do, going through the range of vehicles possible in this game you'll be busy for quite a while.
There's also a Multiplayer I barely got into, as well as an entire LUA based mission making framework, which hopefully will get some documentation soon.

I hope this review was of use to you, at the time of writing I have accumulated around 1.500h in Stormworks and am still enjoying it.",1601041284,1601041284,True,1,0,0.508577585220336914,0,True,False,False,76561198032813742,60,1,103559,10526,94463,1602082971,,

I want to love this game, I really do, but with the release of 1.0, so many things have been changed / broken, its almost unplayable in the way I used to enjoy before.
To summarise, They removed a few key features which made this game enjoyable for me

-Removed mission difficulty. You can now only switch between a predefined career mode, or creative with cheats on. Career is amazing, but if you cant tweak it to your liking, whats the point. Why compromise for settings the devs throw at you when we were able to make our own before... why remove this..

-map random gen is totally broken. No matter what seed you put in, the starter island is always right next to the big continent, causing terrible lags. Again, W H Y

-the sounds, dear god the terrible sounds, I have nothing more to say.

-research mode removed. One of the most enjoyable progressions in the game has been removed, again, W H Y

to conclude, yeah this update added a bunch of cool new features, but in return removed so much, this game just isnt fun anymore. I dont understand why developers remove features when they're prerfectly fine. please bring them back",1600425064,1601022254,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,76561198062999942,109,8,19402,2193,17471,1602082304,,

The only problem with the game that I see is that in 1.0 they reworked the entire mission system to make the game more dynamic. This is good in all and I don't really mind it, but they took away a critical part of stormworks which was the ability to spawn in missions. I used to play around with giant ships and other cool creations, but now they have gotten rid of mission spawning, it as kind of ruined the experience of stormworks.

8,76514134,english,"I used to really love this game. The 1.0 updated added quite a few cool things like the first person equipment and the changes to ropes. But, the game has been changed in ways that make it so it just isn't all that fun anymore. They buffed the wind in the game, but did nothing to account for how vehicles are supposed to handle it. If you want to keep your vehicle from being tossed around like a piece of paper in a hurricane at higher winds, you have to put a magall on it to anchor it. I've had boats, cars, and aircraft all get pushed around like they weighed nothing by wind so often the game is virtually unplayable. I used to use aircraft almost exclusively, as a helicopter is far more versatile than a boat. But with the new changes, using aircraft almost feels impossible in anything but 0 wind scenarios, as none of the engines are strong enough to counter the winds, and most craft will just be tossed around like it's made of paper. Sure, in real life, there are times when aircraft have to be grounded because of sever weather, but this is beyond that. The extreme winds have, in my experience playing 1.0, persisted throughout almost the entirety of my playtime in this version making aircraft unusable. Wind was fine the way it was before. Hell, I would be fine with having winds this strong in the game, as long as it wasn't nearly constant like it is now. I remember before 1.0 the winds got strong enough during storms flying was very difficult and dangerous, but possible. Lightning could strike the aircraft during storms disabling it too, making it a risk vs. reward type deal. Now, it's just not even an option unless you use some vehicle with a ton of jet engines, maybe not even then. As for boats and cars, the same problem applies there too, and I have found myself practically unable to even play the game without overriding the wind, as vehicles become completely uncontrollable or are just outright pushed around in the wind like they're skating on lube, or in the case of boats, have a very difficult time turning and almost cannot even move against the wind at all.

Maybe it's just something with the RNG on my old computer. Maybe it's the vehicles I was using are too light. Idk, but I quite miss being able to actually fly aircraft and play the game. I hope the devs reduce the frequency of extreme winds.

42,62486367,english,"This game is very fun, but unfortunately it has major issues that make it impossible to enjoy the game. The more ambitious your creations are, the worse the performance of the game is. No matter how high end your computer specifications are, the game will slow and break down. If you have the desire to attempt a multiplayer match, you might as well forget about it. Multiplayer used to be fine a year ago, but now is just a painful slow motion simulation, from taking minutes to log in, to the constant ping increases and sluggish gameplay. Even in singleplayer, the experience is subpar at best, which is really strange since this game doesn't have the most overkill graphics or requirements.

Regardless, until the performance issues are resolved, I can't recommend this game to anyone, which is unfortunate since when the game runs fine, it's really fun to play and come up with crazy contraptions.

3/12/2020: There was a lot of optimism regarding ""The Multiplayer"" update, and while I want to say it helped, there weren't any noticeable improvements. The game crashes frequently for any person joining a hosted game, and there is still a lot of lag even for non-complex vehicles. Also, for whatever reason, there is no dedicated Linux server, so for my case, I can't host a dedicated server until that's resolved. Seeing as the game is cross platform, I can't imagine it would take a lot of extra work on the developers' part to make a dedicated server function on Linux, but to my knowledge, there's still no support. I stand by my original review.

9/24/2020: With the recent ""Version 1.0 Update"", a couple new nifty features were added. While withholding a bunch of minor feature releases for a hyped ""one-point-oh"" update is a bit questionable, I will admit that the new features are quite neat, particularly the storm systems. While performance is still quite questionable, and server synchronization feels like it's running at 7 TPS, outside of multiplayer (and continued lack of Linux support) the game has improved a lot since last year, and I'm quite content with its current state.

I got this game in June 2019. I had no idea what to do, I made a boat, Set out to sea, Put the waves to max, sank it. 
Beta was amazing, weekly updates coming out in 2019, Then came the forest fire update, A huge island came out, view distance was changed, I loved making monster trucks and off road vehicles as I tried to climb up to the highest mountain.

When the multiplayer update came out in January. It was outstanding! I now had a few friends who had the game. This really made it more fun

1.0
OMG!
1.0 has been my favourite update (duh). This was amazing, the 1st person equipment is a big change to the game. We can now move ropes to other vehicles, bring people back to life, have a hand held radio so we don't need to add one to a vehicle.

This game is outstanding. Although the physics can be a bit glitchy sometimes, the Dev's are consistently updating the game, fixing bugs.

49,76459416,english,"Very fun game with an active and responsive team of developers. The 1.0 update caused some controversy but it honestly speaks more to the cohesion of the community and the devs willingness to listen. Only a few days after the large update and they have already fixed many of the bugs caused by it and reversed some of the changes that the community had issue with. 

The Career mode in this game is fun but lacking a little depth in my opinion. It can feel a little repetitive doing the same missions over and over again just to gain money (and research points if you choose). However this is changing as more missions and different ways to accomplish them are brought into the game. Despite feeling shallow at times I still enjoy my career save. 

The Creative mode (or just building in general) is where this game thrives. There are few games that are comparable to Stormworks in scope when it comes to designing and building various creations. In this game you can build boats, cars, planes, trains, helicopters, submarines, etc. unlike any other game I have played before. Creations can be very small and simple, or very large and complex, depending entirely on the creator. The easy interfacing of logic and lua programming into creations allows for much more depth and complexity than in other games. 

If you are looking for a game to spend 100s of hours developing and building some megaproject,

After update 1.0.1:
Cons:
Plagued by multiplayer crashes. Both Server and client side.

(Fixed in a new update)
Refinery island (the only place to buy fuel to refill your base tanks) is dead no buttons work.
Missions with fire are impossible to put out using fire equipment both using water cannons fire extinguishers and hoses. Only way to put them out is the run the boats over so the fire is under water for a long time. 

There are often missions where there are supposed to be boats on fire and the fire spawns, but the boats don't so you have fire midair or in the water. 

All wedges/pyramids larger than one block make your water going vehicles slower. (A lot slower)

Pros:

Potentially lots of fun multiplayer rescue missions and with the new dynamics different rescue situations.

Creative outlet building and engineering crazy designs and ideas.

Fun for those that can do programing in lua you have lots of possibilities just in making chip designs for doing stuff like autopilots, UI's for displays etc.

And it is refreshing to have a game where there are no weapons that are made by the developers (i know some people make them in game but that’s just shows what you can do with this game when it works)

So yes I recommend it even with its faults. and now that its released I really really hope the developers can concentrate more on bug fixing instead of new parts for a while.",1600437434,1600884050,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,76561197960472137,506,1,101108,1467,98179,1601595412,,

76,76143282,english,"1.0.10 The game is back to normal for the most part. It is time to revert my opinion to deserved recommendation. The game is in my opinion best vehicle building game on steam. The one thing that I have to mention. It still feels like Early Access. Developers still fix the bugs daily, and promise new features and consider potential major system reworks. If you expect this to be as polished as for example Factorio 1.0, you WILL be dissapointed.

Example: based on developer own annoucement on the game store page. 1.0 change that removed any new game customization outside Creative mode is fine, because you can download mod or write lua script to set your options to what you want. It was part of the UI before 1.0. I don't consider that finished, customer friendly version of the game. 

In short if you only buy released, finished product, consider it still in early access and not recommended. If you are OK with occasional crash, bug, and poorly balanced economy but want a cool vechicle building game. 100% recommended.

Previous reviews:
Update: 1.0.6 is better. With missions working better, but there there are new bugs that are result of rushing fixes. For example now there are parts in inventory that will straight up crash your game. The good thing developers are releasing average of one patch a day so there is a lot of effort to improve the state of the game and most of the systems added in 1.0 are promising. It still feels like more of an early access than when it actually was in EA. And I am keeping the review until the bugs are addressed properly. And the game will start feeling like proper 1.0 release.

1.0 is a broken mess. Wait for a patch. Will update the review when the game is back to working state, because the game in Early access was actually quite good, but the 1.0 update has some questionable choices, features missing, and most importantly major features completely broken like missions...",1600383639,1600877147,True,0,0,0.548903465270996094,0,True,False,False,76561198006680322,1166,19,7812,173,7639,1600976956,,

However...

After version 1 dropped, the mission spawner was nerfed. This is a massive blow to many people as it was replaced by a requirement to learn the LUA programming language to insert any missions other than the main menu when you first create the game save. Many used it to spawn a mission that their specific vehicle could do. It was also useful in spawning vehicles that were too big for a hangar and it was incredibly simple to use. LUA is extremely vast and would take many months to learn it fully. I really hope the devs insert a way to spawn missions again without having to enter lines of code. I don't really use missions anymore as the ones that randomly generate are not at all suitable for the vehicle I created and I can't really test its limits.

That being said, this game is fun and I simply cannot recommend against it.",1600875570,1600875570,True,0,0,0.491803258657455444,0,True,False,False,76561198308270955,25,3,10281,50,10230,1601065099,,

It's so much fun to go out on the water, or fly in the skies- or even hop on the rails, and just explore. Then, you throw in the missions, and suddenly, everything feels exciting, tense, and important! I prefer to play the game like a sandbox game, as that's what I prefer, but it would be a sin to not bring up the existence of the missions.

However, this game has a lot of pros, but a few cons as well.


Pros: 
- Lots of content to go over
- 2 Separate difficulties, to get people used to the game
- Easy Workshop Content installation
- Nice Dynamic sinking/water simulation, for what the game is.
- A long list of other things, that I could go on and on about.

Cons:
- This game is VERY resource demanding. I find myself having to lower the resolution of the game, in order to not have physics lag. This is in part, due to my PC's limitations, but nonetheless.

- Multiplayer almost doubles the previously listed issue, and sometimes it's even WORSE.

- Lack of any type of real building tutorials, to help people get used to how the building works.

Literally 2 days ago, this was a game I would've recommended to anyone who loved adventure or open world or sandbox or exploration game. This games had crazy amounts of depth, a sense of progression, an ability to basically create and destroy and explore to your heart's content. Half the fun I had was putting together custom mission scenarios for multiplayer quests. I could lose myself in this game's randomly generated world.

But then Update 1.0 happened.

Now granted, the update had some really cool things, spreadable dynamic fire, a new toolbar for player items, and hoses. But those new features apparently came at a price, and that price was the removal of tech trees and researching new parts, a severe dumbing down of the game's difficulty to where everything feels incredibly linear and career mode basically serves no purpose, but at the same time turning the normal career mode into a one life hardcore mode.

But worst of all, was the ditching of the mission spawner system. You used to be able to create your own custom missions from a menu that was easily accessible from the map screen, which was incredibly convenient, incredibly simple to use, and more importantly, fun. That doesn't exist now, replaced by a requirement to learn the Lua programming language in order to do custom anything anymore.


They got rid of just about every reason I liked the game, and bought the game, in the first place. No sense of progression, no sense of freedom to do what you wish at any time, no randomly generated maps to discover by seed of your own wit, no easy to access custom scenario system, all of it's gone.

it was removed on some later version.
Control surface for aircraft used to be functioning correctly during early v0.7.x became broken that they only provide drag at higher speed but still far from sound barrier.
Bug reports were there but issue is never fixed or noted.

Critical decision error on v1.0:
Certain parts of the game now uses resource pointer hard-coded in executable (.exe).
For example: custom buzzer*
Custom buzzer is a very creative option for people which allow creation makers to choose any sounds file included with the game to be used in many situations like race start signal horn, car horn, siren or even sound effects for artificial guns or cannons.
Custom buzzers are all gone for now.
Other critical decision error is the game now require all mission makers to code mission script like a programmer.
Non-programmer or non-IT related people might not feel happy with this.

Minor flaws:
Several terms used in game are misleading.

Features got removed but bugs were added.

The physics aspect of things are INSANE, so much is going on, it's very clear why they made the graphics the way they are.

With loads of physics and code running it can in some instances be buggy, but it's still in EA so it's expected.

I highly recommend this title, in fact I cannot recommend it enough, sure it has bugs, but really there is so much to do, and the devs are constantly working on it to improve the experience. Got a new feature you want implemented into the game? The devs even have a drop box for requests on newer features to be added, which is something a lot of devs do not consider.

Also the workshop has what seems to be an endless list of vehicles that the community has worked so hard towards building and developing, each vehicle is it's own unique build. Want to cruise the ocean on your yacht? How about fly to distant land in your UH-60 Blackhawk with a side crane for recovering crash survivors? Neither of those got your eye? Feel free to customize your play-world and remove missions and just cruise around, or see how long you can survive sole adventures into the perilous Arctic sea, the possibilities are endless.

Everything below is when I thought everything about the 1.0 Update made it so that my Titanic would not function.

I have put many hours into this game. At around 1,350 hours as of writing this. I enjoyed creating random builds and creating ships in the Sandbox Mode starting way back in December of 2018. This 1.0 Update has completely ruined that. For the past 5 Months, and over the course of 850+ hours, I have been working on one of the biggest projects I could imagine. I began building the entire Titanic. It has all of the exterior details, has quite a lot of Interior including the first 2 boiler rooms, many public spaces, a lot of 1st Class Corridors, a few Cabins, the Grand Staircase, the entire Engine Room (With working Reciprocating Engines btw), and tons of minor details that I spent so long doing research and looking at reference images and blueprints to recreate this. There are even Watertight doors that you could close, and that those Watertight doors were located in Boiler Rooms 5 and 6, and throughout the corridor of Scotland Road itself too. I have also spent many hours messing with mechanics to make it flood and sink accurately, to even have the ship split and everything as well. I have been a Titanic Enthusiast for the past decade. I thought I would have never thought of a project like this, but then starting those 5 months ago, that is when I got it. I wanted to completely revive the ship on this game, because I wanted to make it a once in a lifetime experience, to see what it felt to walk along different parts of the ship, and to feel that you were back in time in 1912 before that fateful night, and to commemorate those 1,500 people who died in one of the most terrifying and tragic ways possible. I absolutely adored this game but with this 1.0 Update it has ruined the Experience for me. I was looking forward to being able to successfully release my Titanic on the Workshop for others to use and be amazed at it for how realistic it was. And tons and tons of other people could agree that they were excited to see me release this gigantic project that I was approaching completion and wanted to attempt to release it for the big day of 1.0. But in this case, 1.0 has completely bricked the experience and bricked my project. With the introduction of the new Mission System, it has all been completely redone and it is confusing. And what I am most irritated about in this Update, is why was Basic Mode removed? My Titanic could only function on Basic Mode, and I see no reason as to remove it because of how necessary Basic Mode could be for newer players. I started building my Titanic on Basic Mode because I don't want to have to hook up each individual component with multiple batteries, then to hook up the 35 Large Diesel Engines that propel the ship with many different pipes and stuff to connect to the necessary components for an engine to work in Advanced Mode. It is just too much of a hassle and Basic Mode was the easiest way to counter this. I personally don't play Career Mode or anything, since for the past 5 Months I have only worked on this Titanic, putting in so many hours of building, testing, and hyping it up for a big release at some point, because I know lots and lots of people in different servers who were extraordinarily hyped to see my recreation of the R.M.S Titanic. I wanted to basically revive the ship itself in this game since it was possible. I am glad to still have the save files and everything, but there is no way for me to make this function and work without Basic Mode, and at the same time it is completely uncalled for to make it so it is almost a requirement to know LUA Coding to mess with Missions and such now. I am only able to somehow spawn it using the new Addon part where you select the Mission after having the ship placed in Environmental Mode, but since the game is only in Advanced Mode now, it will never work unless if I go through the trouble and the hassle of hooking everything up with batteries and pipes. I could imagine the same for literally almost every other creator who are into building large creations such as me. I did look forward to all the other new features but the only thing I could care for in this update anymore, is to please bring back Basic Mode and to possibly revert the mission editor, or somehow come up with a solution where you can have both types. There was no harm to have an option to either have Advanced or Basic Mode, and it was completely pointless to remove Basic Mode. If anyone reads this, please like it or give it attention because I really hope to have the devs to see this. Please help me be able to make my Titanic function again. I know all of you who were looking forward to it wanted to see this project done, but it has been completely halted until Basic Mode could potentially be brought back.",1600407730,1600801165,True,11,0,0.599236905574798584,8,True,False,False,76561198169845241,35,1,82929,445,80673,1600922080,,

Stormworks is and has always been a really fun and fulfilling game if you are willing to look past the constant game-breaking bugs, and other minor yet extremely annoying issues. 

The development of Stormworks is like a double-edged sword. While the dev team appears extremely competent and quick deploying new features, hot-fixes and responding to community concerns/feedback, they also seem to allocate very little resources to polish or testing in general leading to a panicked vicious circle of bugs and fixes which was more often than not self-inflicted.

My two cents to the developers : now that you are out of early access, please slow down your schedule and take the time to polish & test your releases before setting them free - not every player will be willing to wait for a week or two for obvious, easily picked out and fundamental issues to be ironed out time and time again.

[EDIT - v1.0 Review]

Great game with lots of potential ruined with the latest update / v1.0 : the somewhat rough-around-the-edges research system which made career interesting & gave it a purpose and something to work towards was just removed in favour of a completely bland / unrewarding game mode with no progression whatsoever other than making money.

(This is an edit from my previous post that has been a long time coming:

I believe Stormworks is an amazing concept! But when you look at it for as long as I have, it is obviously a terrible game.

The dev team has not got much together it seems. Those who offer them help are drawn away instantly, those who offer good and simple advice are yelled at, and the devs themselves seem to make SEVERAL terrible decisions. One of these decisions was to scrap an entire mission editor system and replace it with a lua version. Sure this lua version might be better to use but it does not account that much of their game community might not know how to use it well. If they were going to add this they should have AT LEAST made it a separate option. They also said that they would work on making this one of the least buggiest updates the game would have had. All I have seen is that this game has reverted to the old multiplayer system. Sure you don't die out of no where as often but you still clip through walls and freeze as if physics and time are just jokes. I will change my opinion as soon as they can quit diddling themselves and actually do what they chose to do when they set off making a game.",1547501323,1600752231,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198251023200,115,14,164171,9817,153589,1602048715,,

Old negative review ------------------------ 

""EDIT: I changed this review from positive to negative. The old review can be found below. 

I will mention that this game is fantastic creativity and possibility wise. It's way better than space engineers and similar titles just due to the incredible complexity. 

So why did I change it to negative? Well the 1.0 launch release removed literally all the progression that can be done in the game. If you are happy enough with being creative, or like complex construction, go for it. If you need some sort of story, progression, research system, an endgame goal etc. you can forget it in it's current state. 

They removed the research system completely, and you start with all equipment unlocked. Currently career mode is the same as custom mode, with the difference that you don't have unlimited money. That's it.

Once we get some kind of proper progression system back in career mode, I will recommend this game again. I don't understand why they removed such an important mechanic, instead of giving players the ability to enable or disable a research/progression system in an options menu. ""



Older positive review ------------------------ 

This game has near infinite ways of creating whatever the heck you want. Wanna build a realistic boat with cool and stupid features, like a crane, rainbow lightings or cameras, then sure go ahead. Or wanna build a train, but not just a train, but one you could maybe land helicopters or vtols on. And yeah you can build friggin jet vtols! They're like spaceships! And if you pc is beafy enough and you have the time you might even build a flying down made out of many individual pieces.  

I recommend learning the game in advance mode, since then you get the cool stuff like electricity and pipe systems/custom tanks. The learning curve is high, so check out many tutorial videos, but it will be worth it!

Actual review: this game is deceptively complicated, on the surface its a block based building game, under the hood its a complicated balance of dozens of factors each of which have a hood to open up and discover more factors. For me, a lot of the reward from this game comes from building something that works. Getting your first working engine, building your first flying machine, towing your first oil tanker, saving your first wounded fisherman, incredibly satisfying. I've not even done career mode yet, I'm just having fun making more new vehicles.

CONS: You need to be creative to like this game. Of course it's fun to sail through 3 meter waves in a thunderstorm, but you need to sink a lot of time into designing a vehicle to do it. If you don't have the patience for that, there's no game for you here. 
It's very easy to do things wrong and there's almost no indication when or what went wrong. Fuel pump on backwards? Air intake not linked properly? Radiators overloaded? That's is all on you to figure out. There are some methods you can use to problem solve but when I was first starting it was extremely frustrating to not know why my engine wouldn't turn over. You'll need tutorials for this game. Assistance isn't present when your engine blows up from overheating. Only you can prevent forest fires and only YouTube tutorials can prevent engine explosions. 
Multiplayer is more or less just showing off your vehicles to other players. Sure you can build a vehicle to be crewed by several people, but they cant help you build the vehicle. It would be nice if more than 1 person could be editing a vehicle so that way people could customized and optimize different parts of a ship. Maybe I know engines better than my friend and he knows how to use the radar scripting so he builds the bridge of the ship and I build the engine room.",1600728570,1600728570,True,8,0,0.587125897407531738,0,True,False,False,76561198097370099,90,4,6962,824,5968,1601420415,,

Thank you for this review and all feedback received. We have reacted to much of the players feedback we have received. We have added mission spawning UI buttons:

On 17th Sept, we released version 1.0.

On 20th Sept, we re-added ""Classic Career"" mode back in, with research trees, map fog, player icons, and other settings familiar to the classic career.

On 21st Sept, we added new mission spawning UI without any scripting required. Players can simply load their mission in the mission editor, and click ""Test Location"". This will spawn that location and all contained vehicles immediately into game.

Thank you to all players providing feedback! Keep it coming.

Much love <3,

The Stormworks Developers"

update 1.0 brought us an experimental branch, a weather system as well as procedural missions, but in doing so the devs thought it would be a good idea to take choice out of the game. you no longer can choose how your career mode goes, your locked into all the parts unlocked, no research/progression, and permadeath(from what i've heard). at this time i suggest people stay away from purchasing the game as at 25$ it is in inferior product to what it was at 20$. if it remains in it's current state, dont bother unless it's drops under 15.

update 9/21 - devs have listened to player feedback and have reinstated the old career mode with the tech tree. i still suggest waiting on a sale, if it's around 20$ as theres still other features that are missing that the rest of the community liked. i can now reccomend the game.",1600390249,1600694807,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198034819676,440,3,16423,156,16267,1601755527,,

If you plan on buying this, hope you don't need to add fuel to your boat. It's going to really frustrate you, since it doesn't work. The new hose system is bugged.

It still has hoses with the pre-update fluid connector. Nice coding devs. Maybe I could make it work if the update didn't manage to break the winch that the connectors are attached to.
The missions for 1.0+ need some attention, since they don't seem to have been checked prior to release. 
Maybe that is problem, nothing was checked prior to update.

11,76310113,english,"I have 255 hours in this game, and likely will put many more. However the Development team has greatly hurt the game with their latest update jumping from version (I believe it was 0.1) all the way to 1.0. With this massive jump I assumed that there would be an absolutely monstrous list of bug fixes, and stability updates. While there were many of those it wasnt as much as I had hope for, for a jump this big. The development team took several features out that have heavily impacted many players. I play the game solely for playing with mods made from the community, as Im not the greatest builder ever, and even I have been impacted by this update. The part of the update Im talking about specifically is the mission update. Before this update someone could download a mod from the workshop that was too big for the spawn radius, and you could put it into a custom mission you make, and spawn it where you want, bypassing the workbenches spawn radius. They have removed this ability, and have (to my current knowledge) no other way to spawn ships/places/helis/etc that are too big for the workbench spawns. This has made several ships that I love to use often un-usable for me. Now for anyone who wants to play like me, and just do creative, and play with mods then it is still very do-able, you just cant get some of the larger ships and vehicles. Now if your going to play this as a career mode player(starting from nothing, and earning money to make bigger ships via completing missions) then you will be heavily impacted from the removal of the research tree. The research tree was what you would go to, to research new parts as you (level up? I wasnt much of a career mode palyer) progress, such as larger propellers for larger ship building, larger engines, etc. Right now this game has gone from a coastguard simulator with upgrading, and researching things to make better ships to basically a sandbox mode with money involved. No real reason, or motivation to actually go out and do missions, as you already have everything unlocked. if any and all of these problems are changed, I will gladly re-write my review. Until then I would say if you are planning to play this just to mess with the community made mods its great for that, there are amazing creators out there such as Thales who make amazing creations. But if you want to play this as a career mode type of game its lost that after this update.",1600653064,1600653064,False,5,0,0.540636062622070313,0,True,False,False,76561198299975661,117,8,15939,444,15317,1601863108,,

14,71328172,english,"Edit for 1.0 (removed obsolete points from original review):

There is a tutorial... barely.  It walks you through a basic fire extinguish and heal mission, tells you to deliver them to the hospital, and in the end just tells you you need to refuel when fuel is low, respawn ship via workbench and sleep to advance time.  Then it palms you off to the video tutorials... That's all you get.  It seems like about an hour was spent making that tutorial... and even that's a generous estimate.
How do you drop the anchor to stop your boat from drifting?  Where/how do the fuel pumps work?  Did I earn any money from completing that mission?  
I'm in the process of putting out a fire and rescuing some people, oh mission has expired... Like wtf, Im literally burning to death right now putting out an entire ship fire with 1 fire extinguisher....... and then the mission expires!!!  F*@k off...
There were many more annoyances I had with my short time trying this 1.0 version, but I don't want to rant too much more.

Overall, still a not recommend.  Although, I will say that if you have the patience to fight through the learning curve gauntlet, I reckon this is a fun game.  But when a game has you saying in you head and out loud, ""this f*@king game"" multiple times during just the tutorial; it may not be the right game for you.
(If i manage to git gud, I'll update with an actual review of the content......)

[spoiler]PS.  when i see positive reviews from users with 1 or 2 products and 1 review to their account giving garbage info-less 1 line reviews, I seriously question their authenticity and therefore, the general review score of the game.  Honestly, I feel this is a dishonest and disgraceful practice that should be removed from the industry[/spoiler]

Unfortunately, can't recommend this to a new player.  The bare-bones tutorial and lack of in-game help or hints really hinders new player on-boarding.
The possibilities for this look and sound amazing, and is a genre that is rarely visited in games.  
I have no doubt that if its potential is reached, it will be amazing, especially co-op.  Unfortunately, at the moment, I cannot immerse myself in it without frustration from a lack of in-game help.

29,76295301,english,"The game has potential to be one of the most fun sandbox games to date. I've got 2k+ hours in gmod (mostly on WireMod sandbox servers) so I knew what I was looking for. I'll start of with the areas where the game must improve in order to be playable and enjoyable:
- Players can only spawn their vehicles on ""Workstations"". You can imagine this being hell on public servers where 8 players spawn things that clip into each other.
- On creative servers at any point in time players can recall their vehicle to the last used workstation, further amplifying the aformentioned issue. It seems that other people can also despawn other people's vehicles...
- The map is huge, but for each vehicle spawned your client FPS drops by w few fps... the game becomes unplayable with 3 workshop vehicles in the world... I feel like playing Arma/DayZ...
- Sound design must be improved. I had a mini heart attack when I heard the first thunder strike. Most sounds are not directional (the game just plays a stereo sound and decreases volume if you're far away, no left-right balancing depending on your rotation).

Unfortunately the 1.0 release is rushed, but I have my fingers crossed and decided to leave a positive review just to wish the devs good luck and motivate them to improve the performance. 

Great things about this game:
- A great sandbox for roleplay
- A great sandbox to learn programming and automation - the lua integration is awesome (I'd recommend adding more default libraries - matrices, quaternions etc.)
- A huge map to explore (optionally, can also just reveal everything)
- Opportunity for fun co-op with friends - missions!
- Your first cozy flight in a jet with an autopilot is a taste of this game's potential

Multiplayer connectivity remains garbage. Dedicated server hosting mitigates the awfulness that is p2p, but even configuring a dedicated server for this game has been unnecessarily finnicky. However, it will eventually work.

Definitely recommend to people who like open-world simulation sandboxes. However please note that the game is VERY CPU INTENSIVE, this can cause some unusual effects on the game's performance.

My I5-6400 was not capable of keeping up with the game when loading in medium-size ships. Please take this into account before buying, but apart from this the game is definitely worth it.

crashes every hour or so, for multiplayer sessions at least

65,76254746,english,"I had a huge amount of hype for this game going into 1.0. Me and my friends each racked up over 100 hours. Stormworks had a huge potential. But with 1.0 key mechanics and feature were removed for seemingly no reason. the Research tree - gone, the mission log - gone and the career settings moved from the new game screen to in-game but only in custom games. Gutting these systems leaves the game hollow and an empty expierence from the early access. You used to be able to tweak career mode settings before starting a game but this was moved to an in-game setting in the custom mode (creative) only. the research tree gave needed progression to the career mode starting you out with only the basic and require you to complete mission to unlock more advance parts. This simple mechanic, that was in need of work, to balance for example gave the career mode a strong focus and driving force to focus the player's gameplay. The mission  system in Stormworks is broken. It was broken in early access and from my limited time with 1.0 its even worse. In Stormworks missions are given randomly to the player with set time limits and requirements. These mission's don't increase in difficulty or curve with the players skill or previously what part the player had unlocked. During the early access this lead to you need to spend days in-game sleeping waiting on missions to spawn and hope you had the parts unlocked or you had enough time to complete them. This was really boring and annoying to play. With 1.0 they removed the tech tree, so I guess that fixed the not having the parts issue, but the missions are still randomly given. But worse is that they removed the mission log so you cannot tell how long a mission has left to complete. So you can spend days sleeping, get a mission and then get halfway through it before running out of time and failing. This game had HUGE potential, but the devs squandered it with 1.0, I will update this review if the devs ever fix these big three issues.

A feature i suggest:

- A new button in the build menu such as the microcontroller editor button that allows you to place 8 or less points (must be on the red points between the blocks, look at the picture) on your vehicle and link them to each other to create a special cube-like shape.

This feature is important because:

- You get infinite block shapes.



With this feature, you will now be able to:

I have spent about 350 hours playing it and it was very addictive. I took a little break from it the last few months and I was really excited when I saw that it was coming out of early access and that it had a ton of new stuff. I gave it a try by starting a fresh career mode save.

My first impression was that the map and navigation feature has been downgraded to almost unusable state. I think they are going for realism, but before you use to be able to select a mission and the mission markers (destination, people to save...) would show up not only on the map but above the actual stuff in the world making it really easy to identify where to go and what to do. Now if accidentally someone that is following you stops following you (which happens often because the NPCs get confused), it could be almost impossible to find them again because there is no marker above their head. Additionally there is no marker on the map screen for your location making navigation really hard sometimes.

After the first tutorial mission I tried two more and gave up because I got bored. Then I decided to just fly around in one of my older saved creations ... and got stuck in it because for some reason getting out of a hatch that is above you now seems impossible even with a ladder beneath it. It used to be tricky sometimes requiring a few attempts (you just fall back in when dismounting the ladder) but now i just can't do it. 

This is my second time just quitting out of the game after less than an hour of frustrating playtime. At least it is no longer addictive.

I also see that they have removed the research progression tree from the game which seems to make the career mode more like sandbox mode that is harder to have fun with.

Only you don't have that dizzy sense of fog and the unknown.  Rather everything has been revealed.  What once was a career filled with uncertainty and a sense of discovery, perhaps slowly coming out of a fog.  It's now all crystal clear.  ""Who the hell would build a railroad like that?""  ...that huge island is strangely square shaped isn't it?  Oh look, north pole place with floaty stuff.  

Anyway, on to the first mission!

Oh very nice tutorial boat.  The career mode is won by simply building the best boat you could possibly assemble across several hundred hours of careful study of logic, robotics, and the most advanced logic concepts the game has to offer!  Must be that brick you hit me with, cuz I didn't realize I created it already and it sits here in front of me on the first tutorial mission.  Turns out I have already won the game.  

This ""starter boat"" features the technology of SpaceX cleverly disguised as a RHIB.  To complete our perilous tutorial mission we will need the following:  one small boat, preferably with a motor.  One first aid kit, and one fire extinguisher!  Check!

We have:  A Navy Seal Swiss Army Ginsu Knife Rescue RHIB stocked with every damn piece of equipment in the game, along with a two-way wireless radio, electric space heater (always good to keep one in the floor of an inflatable raft!), gyroscopic stabilizer, dual robotic pivot outboards sporting hydroplane stabilizers all managed by custom built micro controllers!  ...is that a radio remote control?  WTH can I talk to it?  ""KIT it's Michael... Go rescue those people!""

This tutorial boat seems to be the reason we no longer have a technology tree to discover.  No need for it, just look at this boat!  It sports more tech and gadgets than Darth Vader's bathroom, what is left to discover on the tech tree?  Time Travel?  

Probably mild concussion from the brick but I seem to recall the original starter boat looked more like a running shoe and barely moved.  It was a joy to use because it was the least of rescue vehicles... and just made you want to get back to the workbench to build something better!  A new player looked at that old starter boat in the editor and the next button they wanted to click was ""New"".  

A new player looks at the logic in this new ""starter boat"" in the editor and the next button they want to click is ""Refund"".   

Things were so different before this head trauma...  I hope they have some bandages ready for a quick evac!  I hold out hope the patient can be saved.  ...we are still within that golden hour, but time is ticking.  Will the patient survive?

Edit: as of today, I am changing my review back to recommended!   This is based on the devs confirming the tech tree and career progression will be added back!  ...along with mission spawn/despawn buttons for the mission menu.  Two critical items will return!

And let's say, I've only enjoyed around half of that time building, the rest are just headaches because of the game, not because of the building.

Multiplayer are still a mediocre experiences at best. Any server that have 10+ players will still lag, a lot.

5,76232090,english,"The game, ""Stormworks: Build and Rescue"", is different from what I expected. You should pay attention to that fact when you read the game description, or you might be unpleasantly surprised. Some good and bad points about the game, in my opinion obviously, from most to least important:
[list]
 [*] Bad – The physics are cartoonish. In contrast, in Kerbal Space Program (ver. 1.3.1)  when I build a plane it will mostly behave as I intuitively expect it to. Sure, KSP is not perfect either, but very playable when it comes to everyday Newtonian physics. That is not so in Stormworks. Components in Stormworks will be rigidly connected even when not obvious, water will flood open spaces even when the openings are far above the waterline, you cannot walk or swim beneath the elevated boardwalk because of the boundary box, if your fuel hose is too short it may easily fling your multi-tonnes boat several meters in to the air, and if you accidentally squish yourself between a rock and a boat the boat and/or you go flying too. The worst thing is that if I build a boat or a plane I am unable to intuitively  get a sense of its performance – I can honestly not tell by looking at a Stormworks plane if it will fly or not, and unlike KSP where modding allows you to debug/examine the 3D force components acting on each vehicle part, I do not think you can do that in Stormworks.
 [*] Good – The design of microprocessors is a lot of fun. You get at blue background that is sort of a blank printed circuit board and you can plonk down modules onto it. The modules are logic gates, adders, formula calculating modules, signal delaying capacitors, video signal routers and a lot more. You can then hook up the modules to each other by simple point and click and build your very own automation for your vehicle/vessel creations. For me this is the most fun part of the game.
[*] Good – A standard Steam license agreement, with none of that ""sell your soul"" stuff. An important consideration when comparing to the price of other games that might despite their low up front monetary payment hide other/further costs, risks or limitations in the EULA.
[*] Bad – The game has been promoted to version 1. For a version 1 game it is bland. I started the game, currently version 1.0.4, to check how the new game experience is. The answer is ""without fun"". That will probably get fixed at some point. My guess is that once the game sales wind down the developers will be persuaded to update the game.

14,65130318,english,"Updating my review for 1.0.

The game used to be pretty good, but the update kinda wrecks it. You build vehicles using a block system and spawn them into the world. Building things is still fun.

The gameplay is where the game falls apart in the new update:
- There is a mission editor but no way to spawn or activate the missions you create. 
- There's no dedicated Creative mode anymore. You can achieve the same effect by fiddling with the Custom Game settings, but that's an extra step now.
- There's no in-game tutorial. There are only videos. Because the builder can be complex, it will take you a while to figure out how to make a workable vehicle. 
- the docks in the game are too tall. There's not many low piers for loading small boats or using ramps. Getting off a boat usually means dropping into the water. 
- empty map. Apparently there's some kind of randomization used, but I have never seen it. Most of the map is just shallow ocean with a few preset islands that spawn in the same locations. 

For $20, it's not terrible but without good gameplay, there is not much to do with the vehicles you build. I don't recommend buying it right now.

16,52826690,english,"I've changed my review from Positive to Negative because the 1.0 release update has been a complete shitshow for server owners and really puts the cherry on top for their complete disregard for optimization. In the change log they claim they've improved multiplayer performance and yet overall it runs worse on the server end then it did pre-1.0 update which is impressive given the already IMMENSE hardware requirements to run this thing. We've got an i9-9900k and we can't even have literally any boats in-server anymore, something we could have at least some of prior to this through having strong enough hardware without major TPS drops. Even large aircraft, something that literally did not affect our server AT ALL prior to this (very little physics calculations required when you're up in the air) can bring the server to a crawl with only one vehicle out.

This is the re-occuring repeat offender behavior that the devs have been exhibiting since the game's release essentially. Tape more shiny features onto the ductape mountain and hope it doesn't fall over. Use more tape to fix it if it does. The only major server performance ""improvement"" we've seen was the addition of 64 bit servers to duct tape fix the massive memory leak servers see which almost no one uses anyway because building a bigger boat to compensate for a leak doesn't mean it isn't going to sink eventually, and in this case the boat sinking on 64 bit is the entire OS crashing when it inevitably runs out of ram. To their credit though they at least managed to significantly reduce if not eliminate the ram leak with the 1.0 update.

I'll consider changing my review back to positive when the server software doesn't run worse than a fully loaded populated Space Engineers server on relatively top tier hardware.

Side note: They still haven't fixed forest fires causing the server to basically crash after a while which is now infinitely worse with vehicle fires.

18,55559395,english,"Hello. In early access I made a review.. I'll admit it was pretty cringe, leading up to me deleting it. This review has been made 2-3 days after full release. They have added things that stormworks players (Including me) Have wanted for years. I am actually amazed on how much the Stormworks devs have done, and its a very... Unique? You could say kind of game. Enough with the speech, (LOL) And lets get to the review.



Well.. 1st of all like I said they added stuff that Stormworks players including me have wanted for years. Tools! We can now repair our ships, as it used to be just ""oh crap my ships damaged wheres the nearest spawn point"" But now you can put things such as welders, medical kits, etc. On your ship, plane, heli, or sub. They also added spreadable fire. Fire used to just.. Sit there. But now it can spread and break your creations. 

If your reading this review, going ""What creations? What what?"" Well.. The base of the game is just to make a ship, use it as a coast guard ship, and do missions saving people, make cash, get bigger boats, and it just goes on.
You are just a coast guard. Past this point is pros and cons, only ones I can think of right off the bat..


Cons: Not perfectly optimized, but it could be much worse.
Cons: Multiplayer still crashes alot, even during full release.
Cons: There's still some bugs, (Getting flung off the map, etc.) 
That's not all the cons, but a game will never be perfect, And I like that

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pros: Really, really, really, really, really, times 100, times 100, times a million, its really fun.
Pros: If your not in to working alot for stuff, the game has a creative mode. You can toggle everything, Unlimited fuel, battery, no player dmg, no npc dmg, no boat dmg, etc. You can control weather, (wind, rain, fog) You can control time (The time of the day, whens sunrise and sunset, ect.) 
Pros: You can now Teleport the player around. (If in creative.)
Pros: workshop support. Download boats, planes, etc.
pros: You can stand up on your boat, plane, etc while its MOVING. Rare for games.

I think removal of the simple mode was a good option, and make the workshop all one type of building, instead of having 2 great contraptions you cant play with because one creator dident make it in Advanced.

Its fine to want to do something on your own, but this is just more than that, it is rude and clearly showing the devs superiority complex. I don't recommend this game for now, I liked it when I first got it, but now this has put me over the edge. DEVS THIS IS NOT HOW YOU TREAT YOUR COMMUNITY.

you want to do pretty much everything except the missions the game wants you to do, but still have fun. Then this game is for you.edit: I still want to give this game a good review however there are some major glaring issues that I must address. First off is the devs lack of understanding of who is actually playing this game. They seem to pander to children and ignore people who want to actually make high quality stuff. They focus to much on big visions of the future instead of addressing the glaring issues such as the utterly useless multiplayer and broken physics. Next off is that the devs try and remove game exploits the wrong way. An example is that people found a way to make infinite electricity by using pivots, now how would you go about fixing this. Well the devs thought it would be a good idea to make the pivots use absurd amounts of electricity making them utterly useless. A better idea is to simply make it so that a tiny electric pivot cannot move a giant electric generator like real life. There is also the issue involving physics, while good in some ways they are horrid in others, in some cases the game does not even follow newtons basic laws of physics, such as his third law. You would think this would not be an issue! Devs please listen to your actual players, the ones who actually build great things, not the ones who spam ""aDD WeaPOns"" and build stuff that serves no purpose.Now the only reason I still recommend this game is because it is the only game that does what it does and as long as you ignore the glaring issues it can be enjoyable.",1575918421,1600449911,False,2,0,0.512195110321044922,0,True,False,False,76561198168686624,57,7,66381,2826,63551,1602037384,,

Planes, trains, automobiles, jets, VTOLs, speedboats, submarines, jetpacks, helicopters, variable swing-wing jets, cargo planes.....you name it, you could build it, all with missions to use your creations in. It used to be that way.

Then the devs decided to make the same mistakes that Space Engineers made and over-complicate things. Complicated is not the same thing as complex. Winches used to be straight forward. You want a mag winch? No problem, just put a mag end on a regular winch. You want a liquid hose? No problem, just run the pipe from a tank to the winch and put a liquid connector on the end. Now, they use a complicated wiring setup that changes depending on which end you put on it. Want to do a jet powered boat? Ok, but screw physics, people were building boats that moved too fast and exposed the flaws in their physics engine so instead of fixing the engine, they made it so you wouldn't see the flaws by limiting the speed. They nerfed the ever living shit out of the water pumps, and gear boxes now appearantly don't work if you use them on generators. Due to a small but obnoxiously loud set of people who keep banging on the realisim drum, this game has gone from an exceptionally fun creative game to a micro-management simulator where the devs have gone so far out of the way to make sure you don't exceed a set speed limit or build an extremely efficient engine. Oh, and if you don't know Lua scripting, don't plan on building any of their advertised newer features like radar. It seems that instead of doing their jobs and developing a game, they're only going to do part of the work and make the players build the rest of the components for them. The funny thing is, those same idiots that are clamoring about realisim are happy about having to build the game for the devs like a bunch of toolbags. If I wanted realisim, I'd shut the computer down. Additionally, by trying to achieve realisim, they have gone so far in the opposite direction that the extreme glaring flaws and lack of realisim stand out like a sore thumb. I want a game where I can put a radar console on my bridge and a radar antenna on the roof and have it work. Not have to actually program it. I don't want to have to learn a new programming language just so I can fill in the missing game sections the devs didn't make it around to completing.

I'm pretty sure this isn't intentional but it makes it basically impossible to play the game. Loading in large aircraft is suicide. Because of the bug you won't be able to teleport them back into the workshop to unload them so once you spawn a vehicle in it will stay there forever. So you basically have a limit of how many vehicles you can spawn. And if you spawn too many vehicles the game will crash a ton and lag a lot. And speaking of large vehicles, you can't do large vehicles anymore. Because you can't do missions anymore. So anything you build has to fit within the workshop which is really limiting.

It was really useful for everything. Also, now you have an inventory so you don't have a flashlight all the time which is not fun. And the game still crashes a lot.

76,76142467,english,"I love building games, so when I saw StormWorks had smaller building blocks than the other games and they had LOTS of building items I bought it immediately.  I'd like to think I'm an avid builder; I use CAD software and blueprints whenever possible depending on what I'm constructing.  Since my builds seem to lag the software a bit, I have to load the vehicle in the mission editor and load it as a mission but it ran very smoothly.  The normal workshop spawn would lag the majority of my vehicle spawns, especially if I had several small ones in at the same time.

Now since Stormworks has been released as 1.0 (out of beta) lots of new blocks have been added that adds quite a bit of immersive rescue gameplay.  Unfortunately they have removed a lot of previously existing features and games modes, including research-Tech tree, loading a mission (what I relied on), rogue mode and creative mode.  The new Custom mode is what creative mode was.  There could also be a LOT more blocks that we can utilize, even dynamic/player-shaped blocks and more utility type blocks.

I am at a stand still in building because I used the mission editor to spawn the vehicles, I could do it repeatidly with each vehicle save.  Until they make the game where I can use the normal spawn & it doesn't lag the game like crazy OR they bring back the mission editor like before, I could continue.  But there are other games I can go to until then.

But as of the 1.0 release date one reviewer said 'If you really enjoy building, testing & running with said design, you'll have fun.  If you're looking for something with meaning and a sense of accomplishment, look elsewhere.'

The new tools, fire spread system, weather system, and noticeable performance optimizations, especially in multiplayer, really improved the quality of life for the little things. There are also new mission creation tools that allow for player-made creations. 

Now to the not so good. All sense of career progression has been wiped... its creative mode but with money. The map, which was mostly procedural with a fog of war, was a fun thing to explore between missions but is now fully explored. There's now no real goal to shoot for with 1.0.

The entire concept which drove career mode is now gone. The research of new parts was completely removed. It is no longer possible for beginners, such as my self, to learn new components gradually, now they're all just thrown at you

The Devs had an amazing setup for Career Research & progression going for it. You would be rewarded with research points, money, random parts on missions completion and you could decide which pieces needed researching the most for the next potential Job. Just eliminating any idea of wonder and exploration has really ruined the experience for us...me.

97,68208024,english,"Ah, Stormworks. For years I have been looking for a creative sandbox and I've finally got the jackpot. I've played stormworks for over 250 hours now, and I can wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone who reads this. If you like sandboxes, and you like to tinker or build, this is the game for you. First, this game has taught me more about technology than any book or teacher could ever hope to teach. It Explains the physics of objects in very subtle ways, and leaves you with nothing but curiosity and grit. If you don't like self teaching, you can work off of builds on the workshop and later use your new found skills to create a successful resque company. If you are lazy and just want to play around in the sandbox, you can use builds from your friends and play around with the physics of the game. Speaking of physics, I love them. This game almost flawlessly simulates water, ground, and air seemlessly, giving you the most life-like experience a game could ever hope to give. submarines, boats, cars, trucks, planes, helicopters, If it fits within the build space, chances are you can build it. But you may be thinking, ""wow this building stuff must be like those battle ship games I keep seeing ads for."" First of all, building is super complicated. I whould make sure to watch a lot of tutorials and experiment with the physics first. It's the easiest way to figure this stuff out. Once you spend a couple of days figuring it out, you should be good for your first build. The building is like micro Minecraft, but with 100+ parts and pieces that have to be arranged in very intimate ways. Plumbing, fuel systems, air intakes, all together it might take hours depending on skill. So take it easy. Start small, like a speed boat, or a Tug. So you may be asking yourself another question- why is this game so low-poly? Chances are you have heard of Minecraft before, it is kind of like that, but not the environment, just the vehicles. This gives worse quality, but much more creative freedom. There are enough block types to make everything look beautiful in this game. In conclusion, this game is awesome and it is 4 AM and I want to go to bed.

This is a very good game if you like in depth vehicles or machines, It also allows you to create some very complicated machines if you wish but I personally mainly use workshop creations. Multiplayer is an option and at the moment of writing the review is relatively stable. 

Bad: it can be difficult to find fixes online for any issues you may have however this should become easier as the community grows, The game is relatively stable but with my specs (i5-8400 and rtx 1660) some larger creations will drop framerate substantially

Overall: The game offers a lot of options for creations either from the workshop or for you to create yourself, for the price of $20 I would definitely recommend this game to other players.

53,74209630,english,"This game is very entertaining. If you like to create, you can create a lot of different things in different ways. The many different parts makes creating hulls relatively easy. The game has many different complex mechanics. The game definitely needs optimization though, as even on my gaming pc, when spawning large or complex creations the game lags. The physics also need some work, and the game doesn't have weapons, whether that's a plus or minus for you xD. The developers do look at what people want for the game with discord polls and the feature and bug page. The career mode is pretty fun, although it can be time consuming to tediously make a bunch of vehicles for different purposes. For me at least, the game is a bit on the harder side when creating things, because sometimes you see a problem but don't know the cause of it. The game allows for very flexible vehicle controls, allowing you to make a giant wall of buttons to press xD. The game also includes logic and a customized LUA scripting language, which allows you to make GUIs with HUDs and maps with monitors. As of when I'm writing this, they have announced the full release and along with it some handheld items and a new modular engine system. The multiplayer is very laggy when over a few players. Multiplayer in general isn't very good, even after they tried to fix it. The game looks visually good. There are an endless amount of things to do in it. I've seen a few bad reviews saying the game is buggy and the developers don't care about the community. Those are both wrong from my experience. The game has some bugs, but none of them are really a big deal, especially not game breaking. The developers interact with the community and do a good job of adding what people want. To prove this, the update after the full release update is going to have modular engines, a feature voted on in the Stormworks Discord server. I like the developers, some may say they are only okay, which is reasonable. But they are definitely NOT bad.

I have played many games in this genre: From the Depths, BrickRigs etc ... and none of the same can beat Stormworks. The variety of the blocks allows an almost unlimited number of vehicles (from ships, submarines, aircraft of all kinds, land vehicles to all-terrain vehicles). Due to the highly frequented updates, the game always remains interesting (even if there are sometimes minor bugs in the updates ;) ... makes the game a lot funnier). The physics in this game are more or less realistic, yet the best in this genre -> only Brickrigs could keep up here. Due to its complexity, Stormworks is quite difficult at first. The ""Arcade"" mode can help here, as the logic circuits are simplified here. In ""Realistic"" mode, however, you need some help at the beginning, tutorials are almost indispensable. Optional would be a tutorial for the ""Lua scripting"" -> because Stormworks also supports Lua. The last point refers to the multiplayer. The multiplayer is unfortunately only partially usable. It works very well in itself ... but only with very good internet, otherwise you are moving in slow motion.

I also think that, despite the game-breaking bug I'm suffering from, the building menu is unnecessarily clunky, and it would be nice to have a proper tutorial or any kind of slow introduction to things, rather than having to rely on videos made by the community.

Stormworks is one of the most impressive build-and-survive games I've seen. Not just in terms of features, but of how hard working and dedicated the developers are, and how they try to work with the community to improve features and add new content. They've made a really unique and enjoyable game. There are options that allow players to choose a low-stress experience, letting them focus less on engineering their vehicles, and more on gameplay, while also having an 'advanced' building mode that allows all would-be engineers make highly specialized and complicated vehicles. While ships and boats are perhaps the primary focus of the game, a player can build ground vehicles and aircraft with relative ease. There's still a bit of a learning curve involved in building an understanding of how different systems work, but learning how to do new and interesting things can be an incredible amount of fun.",1597243274,1597243274,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True,76561197975903062,321,6,19250,0,9207,1600380247,,

Somethings to keep in mind:

-There are no ""real"" Weapons Yet (This is a big turn off to some players - others like myself it's a breathe of fresh air)

-The Map is mostly seas - and although there are rockets there is no ""Space"".

-Stormworks itself can be buggy (especially in multiplayer); slowly bug surely bugs are getting rioned out.

-Stormworks has succeeded where many other titles have failed in creating a realistic water/liquid simulation, the waves are so realistic they can even drag you under when swimming, or cause your boat to capsize if not properly constructed.

Some of the things you may be called upon to do:

-Deliver Heavy Equipment by Land/Sea/Air to a site and install it.
-Recover Stranded Drones/Ships/People
-Manage Resources including two types of fuel (diseal/jetfuel) and Crude Oil (tradable resource)
-Create and Utilize Highly Complicated Designs of Ships, Trains, Aircraft (both VTOl and HTOL), Submarines, and Land Vehicles. 
-Deal with Weather Events that may range from a simple rough seas to a highly dangerous tsunami

I have played some survival, and my only grievance is the lack of totourial. you just get chucked in. I'd recommend playing some creative first.

Multiplayer is almost seamless. It all depends on your internet, and the amount of vehicles/lagginess.

It either goes - Go too these select NPCs bring them from POINT A to POINT B get rewarded with some money and research points to gain a few items to put on your boat or build a new one.

Other missions go pretty much the same way in terms of rewards except this time it's a crate above land or underwater (really revolutionary I know)

If you want to play with your friends (if you have any that is) it has a multiplayer mode but the catch is...
[spoiler] It runs somehow worse than a crippled man... [/spoiler]

If you like playing in slow-motion at all times with your friends and can barely play the game the multiplayer is for you! The multiplayer can cripple pretty much a Nasa Super Computer (I run this game on a really above average high-end computer and the multiplayer still runs like shit).

Where the game shines and overweights the cons is its community and the building mechanics. You can go for hours building boats, ships, spaceships, submarines pretty much anything you can think of as long the game does not break on you. You can browse the workshop download a bunch of community-made vehicles for hours. The developers of the game also update the game very frequently (even do it makes the game run more shit).

- THE MULTIPLAYER
- THE BUMASS MISSIONS
- PERFORMANCE UPDATE

64,45472691,english,"REVIEW HAS CHANGED A LOT OVER THE COURSE OF 2 YEARS

Well here we are! 37 hours in and having a blast, I'm giving this a 7/10, though I really enjoy it.
The reason I'm giving it a 7/10 is because:
 - It's not that hard to get into, the building is easy to get into and had me sucked into it for a straight 8 hours, just because I wanted to finish my ship.
 - Though being very early in Development and being rather buggy, you can still have a fun experience, the career mode is fun, and you learn a bit from it, go into creative mode and have a blast building your own vehicles, ranging from boats, submarines, to helicopters and jets!
 - I really recommend this to anyone who likes building vehicles, it has a simple style and it's easy to get used to!


-----------

Here we are again, 1100+ hours, told you it's worth it :)

-----------

Here we are for the 2nd time, 1700 hours, and to be honest it's lost it's replay value, the game is great but it gets boring.

----------

Ait here we are again, I'm changing my review to not recommended because honestly the devs are fu*king garbage, they don't listen to the community, and instead of giving us features and fixing bugs we want fixed they add half broken features every week to shut the community up for a week.

----------

So in a few weeks the devs will release the game, exiting early access. In my opinion, and to many others, this game is in no state to leave early access. It's buggy, the devs dont listen, and moderation in the official discord server is like China, you even try to go against moderation or even talk about it, you'll get instantly banned. And the devs still dont listen to the community. The game itself is playable-ish. It randomly crashes, physics issues, graphical issues, a lot of stuff that is bugged. And they're going to up the price for it... Terrible dev team.",1540677132,1595729912,False,7,0,0.576348006725311279,0,True,False,True,76561198208026556,112,6,130291,444,4627,1601071365,,

I know that the game is in early acces but the devs really need to work on the game and change the gameplay style. It just does not feel real. If you ask me Brick Rigs or Stormworks answer is Brick Rigs but the lack of updates are pretty common so i dont recommend both games. And im just saying if you want a game like this just go play GMOD. Now im trying to buy VR. So i dont have to play these types of games.,1595454226,1595454226,False,1,1,0.431937158107757568,0,True,False,True,76561198405051528,46,11,688,0,682,1600528836,,

Cons: You cannot do anything
- you cannot create working vehicles
- you cannot create missions
- You cannot edit objects, vehicles,or move them where you'd like
- you can only do and use what others have created for you
- There is no tutorial
- There are no instructions

The only guidance this game gives is a staircase to a workbench if you accidentally start career mode on the starter island. After that you are just supposed to understand.
this is a game that relies 100% on the workshop and 100% on the community. If you want to try and build stuff you can deep dive user generated tutorials on how this games mystery systems work and crack the enigma. You can try to edit existing vehicles but that too is a wild hit and miss. Add a railing to a ship? now it takes on water. Remove an annoying light fixture, Plane no longer flies. 

There is a ton of potential for this game but you are the one to dig to find it. I want to recommend it.

However, the editor is a real garbage...
Endless reconnecting and reconnecting of parts, cause it's real pain to move them, so you recreate and recreate. It's not not an editor, all basic functions are missing or useless.
Physics seems ok at first glance, but just built a hundred meter tall 25cm*25cm tower, with a 50x50cm base plate. Its  not even moving at max wind. And still able to push the whole thing it with my hands ???
No aerodynamics (while buoyancy seems good), you can make a box, add control surfaces and it will fly. If you add a tiny wing to your plane then it can fly at walk speed without stalling. All your engines and robotic parts have superpowers. To the space on a hose!
Adding any shape to your vehicle is almost only for aesthetic reasons. I thought it will be fun to build airplanes, but i lost my enthusiasm. I guess ill have to try befriended with ships, which i am not really interested in.

For me these problems seem like conceptual or limitation of the engine.
However the ""process control"" part is fun, versatile and challenging (building your circuit and add your code to control mechanics and engines, building dashboards, those kind of things)

59,72530442,english,"Stormworks: Build and Rescue is an awesome game which immerses you in multiple scenarios with different, realistic vehicles with incredible weather physics, sort of. For the first 50-75 hours the game is great. but as you move on it gets boring. Mainly because there is no one to play with. Then there's multiplayer which has servers that are complete shit and garbage. They are so incredibly laggy and it's practically impossible to play. The game has so much potential with all it's updates. This game is built for roleplaying certain scenarios. It would be awesome if there were realistic response missions that you and your friends responded too, without immense lag. The game also has the potential to be more immersive. The weather physics are good, however, for e.g ""Your outside a plane, it's loud due to it's engines, you get inside, it gets much quieter. There is rain outside the boat, you go inside, it gets quieter,m ad you here the droplets of the rain on the roof"". This is what I wish would happen instead it's basically the same audio level. I think in some houses across the map if you go into them the weather stops a bit but in some it doesn't, but I want it to stop in vehicles not just houses. There are also several audio patterns from engines that keep repeating it self at an extremely high level, then I turn the game sounds lower which then makes other sounds that I want to be louder that aren't ear-rape engine sounds quieter.
If this game got a massive multiplayer revamp, and you were able to just start lobby's with your friends and not just servers, and it wasn't so laggy and desynced: And if the audio improved itself in a massive overhaul in ways I have explained above. This game would be so darn good, I wouldn't be able to stop playing it man. Oh and also, as a side note, many creations, are extremely laggy and you require a good pc for it, I have a gaming laptop which is alright-ish, kinda garbage and struggles with creations which also make my experience terrible. But this is a personal factor that many of you will not endure. I guess the game could be optimised a bit but whatever, the too main things, AUDIO, MULTIPLAYER.

***Edit*** I've added some tips below for reducing lag which is probably one of the most frequent complaints as game complexity increases.

Full Steam Workshop integration makes this game truly shine. There are tens of thousands of amazing player creations to have fun with with more added every day of course. My advice is to download ones that have been updated in the last 6-12 months for best compatibility given the frequent updates. VTOL's are my favorite all in one SAR vehicles when seconds count.

Lag tips:

After playing for quite a while now in SP and MP there are valid complaints of lag  by players. Design complexity is obviously a factor and I look forward to future optimization to help with that but I have found a couple key factors to look at to reduce lag.

-Check your mods! Environment and structure mods can stack and cause severe lag, especially in MP. Check to see what's enabled and have a dedicated MP save file with minimal or no environment/structure mods. This was a huge culprit for my MP lag.

-Design complexity can have adverse effects on your game performance but it isn't always the problem. HUGE Titanic sized ships are going to lag - period. But there are some seriously advanced jet liners that hardly lag at all, even in MP, and I think that is due to the mod designer's streamlining of their own design. And again, some are just so massive that there's nothing that can be done without owning a beefy system.

-Try to reduce excess objects in game or turn your draw/spawn distance way down to compensate. Until the game gets further optimization or they change background spawned vehicles if you have 12 aircraft dotted around different bases and a couple of ships it's going to lag quite a bit. 

-My friends have reported good success in lag reduction by turning off VSync. 

-Internet connections play a factor in the MP so make sure whoever is hosting has a decent connection. I host my friends at 100Mbs.

Finally, remember this is very early access! You are not going to get polished AAA performance all the time. Use the developer feedback tools in game to submit bug and feature requests and help make the game even better.",1591587354,1594412889,True,14,1,0.656819522380828857,0,True,False,True,76561198049328852,747,33,9953,1288,2750,1601754512,,

This game is fun if you like sandbox/build your vehicle type of games (i do), if you are more into story driven games than this game might not be for you.

Every now and than (maybe weeks maybe months) a new update commes out ussualy adding new blocks/items and missions (maybe even new land but those are ussualy hyped alot beforehand). It is still in Early Access but it isnt a downside because it isnt a buggy mess like some other Early Access games.

It also has a big talanted community and workshop support with cool stuff being uploaded there daily (with introduction of invaroment mods people are making automatic train lines, bus lines, cable cars etc.). 

Overall this game is not to hard to get into but hard to master (you will make your first boat releativly quick but you probably wont make automatic trains in your first 100h).

It also has lua support and screens so you can code the screens to display stuff (like cctv system and touch screen).

The water physics in this game are quite good (stuff can flood you can close a door to prevent the water to flood the rest of the ship if too much of the ship floods it will sink maybe even leaving air pockets)

If you are into this kind of build your own vehicle games i would recommend it so far it was fun.",1594073859,1594073859,True,1,0,0.522058844566345215,0,True,False,True,76561197997961292,108,2,9542,0,9239,1595673200,,

1. The Logic block system is super fun and lets you make your Creations much more useful

2. Has a lot of different block shapes like pyramids, inverse pyramids, and 2x1, 4x1 versions 
    for those shapes

3. Water buoyancy and physics works nicely (my Ryzen 5 3600 CPU plays this game good)

4. The Creation editor is the best i have ever seen it has useful tools like the selection grid
    but make sure you change the camera because the default one will make everything 
    harder

issues that i hope get better this is still a early access review

1. The way the NPCs follow you is ridiculous if you go too far ahead of them they just stop, 
    and will forget how to think if they try to climb a ladder

2. random bugs like seeing 2 of everything in a tsunami

i will give thumbs up because for an early access game yes there are bugs and problems but the game is getting updates and fixes and i have already spent 29 hours on the game so yes.",1593141041,1594005418,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True,76561199028114034,3,1,2876,0,722,1598138414,,

Update(July 5th, 20):
There has been an update about adding items that you can equip that has been talked about for some time. The devs have talked about it with like 4 or 5 ""News"" updates about how it's an upcoming update... Now normally there is not much of a problem, just that the update is taking a while. I get it if they want to hype it up to get more people to play the game, but there is a suggestion that would fix this. ADD MOD SUPPORT! If there was mod support to make custom blocks, than so much energy could be put on the community. Does someone want a block that is not avalible in the standard game? Add support so that they can add the block themself. I'm not trying to hate on the game, I think the game is amazing! I just think that the updates should be handled better(?) I don't know, I'm not a game developer... 
Some suggestions for the developers:
  -Mod support...
  -Items
    -A fluid/fire hose/better handling for connectors
    -(I'm not sure if it's what I saw, but if not...) A hand-held controller to control mechanisms remotely over radio or other

I will probobly update this list later on...",1572580726,1593987982,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True,76561198296406147,128,36,21931,1215,6613,1602033141,,

66,72117072,english,"Very good early access game. I have been playing career mode and am particularly impressed by the lighting, weather, general atmosphere and physics, you really feel like you'e a coast guard going around rescuing stranded people, hazarding large waves and stormy weather, managing fuel and delivering things. The map appears to be really gigantic as well, so it's good for exploration, and the number of detailed creations on the workshop gives even people who aren't into building a lot of different vehicles to play with. 
If I had to offer any criticism, it would be mostly towards the npcs, or rather the lack thereof. There are npcs in the world but they seem to be mostly spawned in for specific missions. If you just run/drive/fly around random villages, which are all over the place, you will never find anyone in any of the buildings, nor is there any random helicopters or boats around in the world. I think the game would improve a lot if they could incorporate some stray npcs standing around houses, and boats that patrol here and there, the odd helicopter flying around, even just giving the appearance that things are going on. Because the game nails the other elements of immersion like weather, graphics, physics, but just lacks on this aspect of being a little too empty outside of missions. And to tie those two together, more 'stumbled upon' missions, like finding a random person floating out at sea, would be really nice too, instead of the more formal ""you got this mission now go do it"" variety that you tend to get now.

This game seems like a fun concept, but unfortunately the developers have chosen to design the game in a way that wastes player's time. Specifically, the research tree is a huge problem. Researching a single item at the beginning of the game takes between 30 and 40 real-world in-game minutes. There are about a dozen items to research at the beginning of the game, and there appears to be hundreds total. I'm not sitting around for that!

Further, building large ships is a tangled mess of tedious node connections with no real tools to help organize or understand how large systems are connected. An average player will need to download any reasonably complex ship from the workshop because of how poorly organized the ship builder is, especially data connections.

As the game is still in early access it does contain some  bugs, However I have yet to find any that are game breaking. For me personally I find it frustrating that the water level is always visible, even when inside a sealed section of a boat, however I can not be sure if this is a bug, as watching videos on YouTube, the players I watch do not seem to have this, or I simply havent noticed. Also it could potentially be my 8 year old computer with outdated hardware. My PC does not meet all of the recommended requirements, and because of this I do suffer frame rate issues when in ports etc, however this cannot be blamed on the game, as far as I'm aware, it's my old computer. Again, due to the old computer I do have to play with all the settings turned down low.

Some people may find the game difficult to get into, I've found that there is a bit of a learning curve, mainly if you play in advance mode, however there are plenty of tutorials that can be found on YouTube. I found MrNJersey to be extremely helpful and interesting, if you like games such as kerbal space program, I would be very surprised if you do not enjoy this game.

I havent tried any missions etc that the devs have provided, and I dont even know if there are tutorials (had the game a while, havent even looked). I tend to spend most of my time in sandbox mode building stuff. I like how when building there is different options as to how involved you want to get, there is the possibility to add monitors and custom scripts that can be entered so the monitors (or whatever your using) can show/do a whole range of  stuff. Or you can simply connect the monitor to a camera and it works. I also like that there is an advance mode, which means engines need air fuel exhaust etc.. or you can turn this off and simply place an engine down.

 The game is updated very frequently as well which I find really positive, especially as the game has been around for at least a year.

I personally havent looked into multiplayer, I assume my computer wont be able to handle it, however the idea seems like an amazing one.

A flaw in the game's anti-piracy system causes me to have a false positive on my pc and doesn't allow me to play quietly as its system is very beautifully designed to annoy you every second of play with fish flying around and destroying everything. 

For a few months I waited in case they fixed it in some update but they didn't, so I ended up complaining in the support but they closed the complaint, they didn't answer me or if they did it was after I insisted asking them for help because I just wanted to play. Many treated me as a pirate (when I have the game bought and never had it pirated) and even the developers ignored me for a long time. When one developer finally responded, she sent me to another developer who again ignored me.

So, finally after months of wanting to play. Here's my negative for ignoring me and not helping me, and for having a [spoiler]s-h-i-t-t-y[/spoiler] anti-piracy system.

The funny thing? I got banned from the discord for pirating! The same developer of the game banned me for a bug in his system, being that I have bought the game!

I didn't expect anything else after all.",1590509653,1592933921,False,330,76,0.652482032775878906,48,True,False,True,76561198069277320,275,9,2950,33,1845,1601187398,1592904452.0,"Hi all,

We regret this player had a frustrating experience and we always work hard to address issues where we can help.

To clarify a few things:

One of our development team (Beginner) responded to all of this players issue reports starting 14th March and helped this player on 19th March, 24th March, 3rd April via Discord DM (before this review was posted). However, I don't think the player understands that Beginner is on the development team and he has been speaking to the best possible person. 

This player is no longer experiencing this problem. It was solved when our engineer used remote desktop to simply delete Stormworks and re-download. We had already recommended this at the start and do not know why this didn't work when the user had tried it.

The cause is that this player had modified executable files in their install (ie not the version that we distribute). We don't think there was a pirated version installed (as it makes no sense since player has it on Steam), but we don't know why the files were modified. Corrupt download? Bad hard drive sector? Virus that is self-replicating into other files? Some other unusual environmental issue? We simply don't know and can only guess.

We can see other players suggested this player is a pirate on our bug tracker, and from the player point of view, it isn't clear who is making these comments. We have added a color marking for all developer accounts on the bug tracker so now it is clear who are players and who are developers.

We will look into a ban issue and contact player in person again.

Much love <3,

The Stormworks Developers"

Cons: The dev team is disorganised and out of touch both with the community and development practices. They are quite happy to break the game and go home for the weekend, leaving everyone unable to play. ""But it's early access"" isn't an excuse, but they use it constantly. They refused to make use of branches on Steam saying ""It makes no sense to make multiple versions available via branches"". No sense at all, except we would have been able to play while you clocked out.

The project team is so desperate to advertise the game via youtubers who attract young kids to the game, giving them a completely inaccurate perspective of what the game is and what the community is about. They have no clue  who their target demographic is and end up annoying half of the community with every update.

Feature creep is massive and there is a huge reluctance to work on core parts of the game that are advertised on Steam (multiplayer is all but useless still to this day) but are quite happy to start grand plans about the future.

They do not moderate their communities except via automated bots, which are over-zelous and badly configured, muting people left and right who have legitimate questions yet somehow allowing spammers and trolls right through.

We understand that resolving any issues in the game is very important to players and therefore is very important to us. We are constantly fixing issues in the minor updates, and also release hot-fixes for any critical issues as quickly as we can, often on weekends and bank holidays. 

We appreciate there is still plenty of improvements for us yet to make and we actively continue to work hard on the game. We would never use ""Early Access"" as an excuse and think developers who do so are wrong.

We review feedback continuously on our issue tracker, we keep track and engage in discussions on the Steam forums, Discord, as well as read your comments and feedback from our weekly Steam announcements. We really enjoy hearing what players have to say about their experiences and ideas.

We think communication and listening to the player community is essential which is one of the reasons we recently ran a poll on our Discord - because we think all players should have an equal and fair say on the development of the game.

We don't do any sponsored content - all the youtube videos you see are organic. We do not have any control over which youtubers cover the game and what content they make, nor should we. We don't think youtubers should have any more say over the development of the game than any other player.

We think conversation on Discord should be mature and clean, which is reflected in the Discord rules (no swearing, abusive language, spamming, etc).

[b] The Good [/b]
- Open World. The world is randomly generated, but with the same islands spread out around the map, randomly depending on the seed. 
- Interesting Missions. From rescuing trapped scientists to putting out fires on an oil rig, there is always something to keep you occupied.
- Sinking Physics. You sail into a storm and forget to close a hatch? Your ship will slowly take on water, list, and sink. 
- Building. You can build planes, ships, trains and more. From the smallest sailboat to a tanker ship, or, from a small single-engine jet to the A380. 
- Updates. It's almost weekly that the developer adds something new to the game, or fixes existing bugs. 

[b] The Bad [/b]
- Lag. Now, this is going to happen regardless, but the more complex the vehicle, the more lag you can possibly get. This isn't as much of a flaw, more of an issue of an aging graphics card.

Stormworks Multiplayer, DARNIT! I vomit at multiplayers feet, its GARBAGE! 
Me and my friend used to play multiplayer together, and using the in-game chat or spawning medium sized boat literally DESTROYS your game and it crashes before you can say boat!


BUT. You can build whatever you like, cars, planes, ships, giant military vehicles, rockets that will.... Maybe crash your game?
Some giant vehicles will crash your game depending on your computer. I recommend if you want to play with large vehicles, do it in singleplayer.
Another thing about Multiplayer is the S L O W D O W N S. Instead of lagging, Stormworks literally goes so slow, and its hard to EVEN MOVE!


Anyway, its a fun game with damage, sinking features, fires, creative and career mode, and even some hard modes like Rouge.



Overall though, its a really fun game, great for building boats and using your creativity.
7/10. Would be 9/10 if the so called ""Multiplayer Update"" Actually had a impact.

I'm sure other gamers and youtubers would point out this game for you and recommend it to you. The only problem I have with it is that if you have a computer that can't process big games, multiplayer interactions, has bad internet, and/or wifi, it becomes slightly laggy to crashing. Other than that, this is my favorite game on steam.

The game tho lacks some good missions in my opinion, some missions can feel very dull... but the devs said they'll get a new career mode so I can't wait for that, but honestly missions are still playable very much and still fun, most fun I had was building my weird creations and seeing them come alive.

 I tried to add fuel, fuel tanks, batteries, a throttle, and several other items to no avail, but at the workshop it showed no issues, and that my wiring was correct. It would have been super helpful to have little ""message pings"" that say, ""engine wiring incorrect"" or something like that, and then walk me through the process on how to correctly solve the problem.  Basically, I would need like a, ""Stormworks for dummies"" guide.

I am going to keep this game on my radar and will probably purchase again when more updates come out!

69,70761045,english,"I think this game is incredible. The world building is wonderful. The game is simple and intuitive. You don't have to have a degree at Embery Riddle Aviation School to fly or build a plane. The game has been crafted well, and has potential. The problems are the lack of basic equipment. This is your Modular Engines, Weapons, and many others. A lack of customizable infrastructure causes the game to be a bit bland at some point. An example of this is the Blue Hawker V10 VTOL. The vehicle can do almost anything and makes the point of the game bland. This game is similar to Scrap Mechanic, however it does a lot better. I personally recommend the game, however it does need a ton of improvement. 
Now the Facts:
=PC Requirements=
The PC you use doesn't have to be top of the line, but better than average is preferred for good in-game physics FPS, and also the game isn't very stable when running on a low-end system. (Physics FPS is the actual passage of in game time. Stormworks tries to keep a constant FPS by changing the Physics FPS.) Do note that AMD users may have trouble because the game runs on a single core, meaning AMD's pattern of making single cores less powerful and adding more of them will cause the game to be slow.
=Gameplay=
The gameplay takes time to get used to, and rushes you into the game. There is a tutorial, however it is quite bland. I know this because I have over 1000 hours on Scrap Mechanic, doing logic for jet engines. It still took me 100 hours to fully get used to the building and logic system. There is no story, just a career of repetitive missions. Be ready for being frustrated for the first 50-100 hours. 
=Similarity to other Games=
This game has some similarity to Scrap Mechanic. Scrap Mechanic isn't nearly as good as Stormworks, but it is simpler. If you could, start with Scrap Mechanic to learn some basic principles of building and logic. After some time on Scrap Mechanic, you can move to Stormworks. Otherwise, the game doesn't have any other similar games. 
=Multiplayer= 
The multiplayer is laggy, but it does work. It is enough to make it interesting, and I don't think the game would work at all without it. Do not get this game if you don't want multiplayer.

9,70631092,english,"Absolutely fantastic multiplayer-friendly game! After playing for over 100 hours, I decided it was time to write a review. Stormworks: Build and Rescue is an amazing game which allows you to build to your heart's desire. You can be as creative, or as basic as you want. The principle behind this game is to build, have fun, and learn something new at the same time. This can be in the form of basic logic, Lua, or just learning how to create a complicated shape. 

So, now I have done my main part, I will break down what is so good about this game;

Detail: The detail of the map, creation parts and even the water physics are brilliant. They have clearly put a lot of effort into this game, which is one of the reasons why I have rated this game so well. 

Multiplayer Compatibility: The Multiplayer version of this game is fantastic. They have optimised it really well and have created a great capacity server system for people who want to hang out with large groups of friends.

Survival and Creative damage modes: The Survival mode in this game is great. It allows really realistic damage systems, like collision damage from if you get hit by a fast-moving creation or depth damage, for if you are too close to the ocean floor. Creative is brilliant too, with no limits, you can do whatever you want, no matter how dangerous it is.

Creative and Career game modes: The feature to be able to build to your heart's content, or to have to earn money to be able to build things is amazing. I personally have had a really fun time testing out both modes and I can say, They are fabulous.

The cost: I would say that the cost of this game is a very fair price. The amount of effort for this game to be created has payed off very well, and would urge anyone who is thinking 'this seems expensive for a game like this' to buy it. It is very much worth the money and I would like to say a massive CONGRATULATIONS to the developers of Stormworks: Build and Rescue for creating such a well-thought game.

Overall, I would say to anyone having any doubts over the quality of this game that it will make you extremely happy, for a very long time.",1591885943,1591885943,True,1,0,0.513888895511627197,0,True,False,True,76561198993778202,9,2,7960,287,6086,1601745361,,

Most of your time is spent creating and fine tuning creations to use in the open world. This will suit you if, like me, you prefer to be creative in a technical way. It's very satisfying to build something and tweak it until it is perfect.

The live gameplay centres around search and rescue scenarios such as rescuing swimmers or stranded tourists. There are also logistical type missions requiring you to move a large container or install equipment on the ocean floor etc. These will require you to create a variety of vehicles to complete.

Now I've pretty much exhausted the missions (~200 hours play time) I've moved on to the creative mode where you can create whatever you like. I'm absolutely loving the freedom to make whatever I can imagine.

There's a bit of a learning curve if you want to take full advantage of the game but well worth it and very satisfying once you learn.

The community associated with this game makes it. There are very active discord and reddit channels dedicated to the game, meaning lots of the advanced features have been well documented by savvy players and there is an abundance of content on the workshop to either learn from or just play with.

Stormworks is not without it's fair share of problems and you have to be mindful it is still early access. Be patient and open to adapting to changes made.

67,70443785,english,"Stormworks combines fun a engineering sandbox with a mission and progression system.

The engineering side delves into systems engineering to a greater depth than Space Engineers, and perhaps Stationeers, but feels more intuitive that either of those other games (which both stand well on their own).

I enjoy a good engineering sandbox, but without good incentives to do things, they tend to fall flat for me. Stormworks provides missions that encourage you to solve problems with both engineering and piloting skill. Missions reward you with both money (for buying parts), parts (which you may lack the research for), and research points (to spend one researching new parts in a research tree).

The (optional) research tree benefits the game in that it provides a sense of progress, but also in that it helps avoid feeling overwhelmed with the sheer variety of parts. Typically you'll start by making a basic boat, and move upwards from there. There's a learning curve, but a comfortable one - and that's all part of the fun.

Create new crafts (boats, cars, aeroplanes, helicopters, ...) to solve a problem, or adapt a previous creation to new needs and as your research progresses.

The game itself adheres to a mostly textureless aesthetic, to beautiful effect (somewhat reminiscent of Japoly, but even more beautiful).

However, since it is early access, it hasn't received a certain quality of life update that, before any major extras, it needs. The builder's copy/paste feature, important for any large-scale blueprint, is unintuitive and slow, as is the camera in both modes. 
It plays great, and honestly I'm impressed with the physics engine for handling whatever I can throw at it. There's plenty of materials to work with and it works beautifully.
However, this game LOVES to show off, and could do with a more simplistic option for building - objects animate their rotations and fly in from offscreen when building with them. Generally, this gets in your way. It can also be difficult to troubleshoot your engine or figure out which way things go, since there usually isn't much of an indicator and many parts show two ""inputs"".
However, the game looks beautiful, plays beautifully, and has an excellent physics engine, and can only get better from this early stage as time goes on.

Sucks can't even return this HEADACHE of a game because it takes 4+ hours just to build a stupid TINY boat and that's with watching a fkn you tube video STEP BY STEP because doing yourself would be impossible because the game teaches you NOTHING!! Games just trash has no direction what so EVER.. You spawn in... it doesn't tell you NOTHING! Not where to start nothing!! You stand there with your thumb up your a$$ like wheres You Tube.... Gives you a job to pick up supply's OK GREAT... How big are these supply's??? How much do they weight??? What kind of equipment do I need to move it?? a Boat?? A Car?? A Truck? A plane?? WHO FKN KNOWS!!!! CUZ IT DON'T TELL YOU JACK SH!T! 20$ FKN HEADACHE... And that's putting it light... After all that BS to build 1 measly little boat you try and fuel it and its literally a job in it self..... you gotta un winch this do this do that..... LIKE WTF IS THIS MESS??? What kind of moron thought this up??? ITS A FUELING STATION MAN! NO WENCH'S NO BS!! Why do you make it so complicated????????? Let me pick up the damn nozzle and bring it to my fkn boat!!!!!

48,61138225,english,"I was in a plane, on a plane. The pilot did a fly-by for me at the coordinates and I detached my miniature plane to circle around. I assessed the ocean emergency by flying overhead. I saw a large research boat, stationary. When relaying over the radio to HQ, I recommended a passenger boat to come pick up three passengers and reported that I could only remove one - my plane was only a scout that can float. The rescue boat reported he was only 4 km away before I could even prepare to board my passenger. Right before I was about to take off with my one, a tsunami came out of nowhere and wiped everything out.
I quickly dove to my sinking plane, equipped a diving suit, and grabbed the passenger from my plane. I surfaced, left the passenger floating, and dove to grab a passenger from the bridge of the research boat. The rescue boat was closing in on us now, but there was one passenger left - the engineer. I dove a third time, went into the hallway of the now upside-down research boat, and sealed it off. I realized I was now walking on the ceiling of a sinking boat. I walked on a smooth surface with stairs above me on the ceiling. I ran past the kitchen and then the engines, got the engineer, and ran back to the hallway. I opened the door, and instantly the hallway was flooded. I busted to the surface and the rescue boat helmsman and I started to make our way to the rescue boat with the passengers following. all of the sudden, the game crashed.
This is a common and recurring theme. Whether the game crashes because you sent a chat or because whatever code is broken, it crashes often.


Stormworks starts simple and then gets complex. Semi-real world building concepts, logic and coding, engine optimization. Sail the seas, master the air, scale mountains off-road, dive into 300 psi water pressure, save the damsel, deliver medical supplies.

However like most dev games there is a slight warning, some changes have made the game a lot harder. At this stage there are two main flaws 

Its hard to understand when first starting the engine mechanics / power requirements and required circuitry, Winches are now bulkier and harder to use since the winch update. also and understanding of which of the new winches to use is tricky without explanation.

If you get into vehicle designing, and chop and change you rig for each mission, the mission time does not stop during your edit anymore.... making testing and ensuring that you have everything perfect a ton harder. this will making for your first vehicle, and perfect it

If you like tinkering with machines and building stuff, I especially recommend it.
Fluid dynamics and engine simulations are quite involved and you will probably have to build many iterations/test benches to figure stuff out.

Positives: 
 - very free form editing, 
 - detailed piping for engines and electronics 
 - environment (waves, blizzards, fogs) looks actually very pretty despite game's no-texture approach
 - you won't run of things to build for a very very long time (boats, helicopters, rockets, trains, trucks, forklifts, flying jet-turbine powered submarine with giant claws, you name it..)

Current negatives are:
 - editing tool are in some ways extremely tedious and inflexible. Rotating part takes about 6 clicks and usually multiple camera adjustments. 
 - there is no easy way collaborate on design with your friends in real-time
 - while part content is great, mission count is limited and unless you mod, you will be repeating them eventually
 - map, despite being huge, does not contain that many locations (mostly empty ocean)
 - there are numerous glitches in multiplayer (client side prediction failures - random crashes, teleporting boxes, glitches on ladders killing NPC, dedicated server not being visible for some etc)

0,41632863,english,"I love this game. Here are the main reasons:

1. The Physics. I have spent some time on boats and I have to say: the physics of driving boats are very well captured here. It feels very real and this makes it a lot of fun for me, just seeing my creations gracefully ride over the waves (or turn upside down when touching the throttle when I put too much power into tiny boats). The waves change with the weather, getting higher when it gets worse and the further you are from shore. Also you can walk around in/on your vehicle while it is moving and even have mutliple layers of subgrids.

2. I have played a few build-your-own-vehicle games and Stormworks' build mode is the absolute best! It is easy to get into, while having great complexity. You can build boats, submarines, cars, trains, planes, helicopters and anything in between.
Also you have to wire the functional components together to make them work. This is simple to use, but you can make it very complex if you want to, with all the logic gates and whatnot. Player character height is 8 blocks.

3. Not only can you build cool stuff, you actually get to put it to use. I feel like most games that try to do this get one of these two wrong. 
Not this one.
There are 32 missions that put your engineering skills to the test: rescuing people, transporting urgent cargo, towing tankers and putting out fires is a lot of fun. You can build highly specialised vehicles or try to come up with one design to rule them all.


And here are some things to know, before you buy this game:

-You are going to spend a lot of time traveling to missions, rarely up to 5 minutes IF YOUR BOAT SUCKS. You can, though, teleport yourself and your vehicle back to base at anytime in standard mode.

-If you easily get motion sickness and insist on using first-person-view then you will get motionsick from the movement of your boat (which I think is awesome, you actually get seasick xD). Third-person-view is just fine, since it is not affected by roll/pitch.

So, all-in-all, this is the vehicle building game I always wanted! The DEVs are quick to respond to their community and the weekly updades keep coming! Thank you DEVs.

The concept is great. The world is great. There's a lot of great ideas with this game, but it's lacking two major things.

1) A tutorial or some sort of help for beginners. I literally had to go searching out YouTube to find help. And unless I missed something, I had no clue what I was doing until I downloaded some vehicles from the steam workshop. But the starter boat didn't do anything. Am I supposed to build it into a working vehicle? Tooltips, hints, or SOMETHING needs to be added for new people coming into the game.

2) This game runs horrifically. I have a decent system but everything ran in slow motion pretty frequently. I did a Google search on this, and this has been an issue since 2018?! It seems like a block game such as this needs to have more optimization. It's disappointing that a game with low end graphics runs like this.",1590696900,1590696900,False,4,0,0.485954076051712036,0,True,False,True,76561198063322427,192,21,41,0,41,1590696633,,

50,69806696,english,"TLDR; Stormworks is a fantastic, limitless game that is well worth the money

I have been playing Stormworks since the early stages of development, so I have been lucky enough to see this game evolve. I even quite enjoyed it myself, having over 100 hours into the game at the time of writing this review. There are limitless options for you to experience in this game, from hardcore permadeath survival to creative mode, and everything in between. You can build your own cars, trucks, boats, submarines, airplanes, helicopters, and really anything you can think of. If you're not as creatively inclined as some people, you can take a look at the Steam Workshop and download any of the community created vehicles for your own use. This game has been getting more and more optimized so you are able to use larger and larger ships, as long as your PC can support it. If you want even more possibilities, you can play with friends on your own private server! You can act as a crew for your ship or you can even bring out multiple ships and have a convoy, and even run the ships into each other. That brings us to another unique aspect to the game; ships can take damage, take on water, and even sink completely. Have a collision with another ship? You better hope you didn't take damage below the water line! Did you find yourself running into shallow rocks? Your time above the water is limited so get to your base as fast as you can. Some ships even have their own lifeboats in the event of an emergency!
So what are you waiting for? Add Stormworks to your cart and start playing this amazing game!",1590446250,1590446250,True,1,0,0.5,0,True,False,True,76561198355258718,36,9,8399,69,6049,1600988812,,

Finally.... FINALLY!  The developers have moved this resource-heavy game into the realm of 64 bit, which has been an absolute game changer.  Before this update you could easily get the game to lag even with today's high-end gaming PCs.  Now that the game can utilize everything a PC offers, you can get into some very complex builds without worrying that you won't be able to actually play them.  This game is now one of my top 10.

-------------------------------- Original Review Below --------------------------------

I was on the fence for quite some time about buying this game.  Even with the wonderful ""sales"" videos there was something that made me a little cautious.  I felt like the game was going to be really cheap and be just another horrible boat simulator with a ""build what you want"" twist.  Boy, am I ever happy to be proven wrong.

This game (simulator) functions on one premise.  If you can think it, you can build it.  That said, if you just want to make a box and slap a propeller and rudder on it then you can do that too.  The complexity of your designs are entirely up to you.  That said, there is a bit of a catch.  More on that later though.

Starting out you'll find a lot of customization in this game.  You can take it as far as you want, from almost completely realistic with fuel requirements and ship damage to total ""my helicopter can work underwater"" safety.  You can even mix and match, for example have no fuel requirements yet allow ship damage (or vice versa).  There's even a creative mode.  In addition to the wide open build creativity, these additional world options open up some MAJOR replayability.

In creative mode you have unlimited time to come up with designs, which can use either the ""safe"" or ""realistic"" settings depending on what you select when you first create the world.  To build something you simply walk up to an associated workbench and use it.  You'll be taken to the build interface, which is a VERY well thought out place to get creative.  There are too many options to list them all, but some of the features include;

- The ability to mirror your placed blocks on either the X, Y, or Z axis
- Full 360 camera movement around a 3d grid so you can see your build from every angle
- Ability to move the camera anywhere you want (hold alt)
- Ability to zoom in, through objects, to work on interiors
- A well organized parts catalog and the ability to drag parts to a quick-slot type location
- Well labeled tool-tips
- Ability to label components
- Color coding when connecting up the ""logic"" of the ship (eg. lights to switches)

Ok, so what's the catch I mentioned?  Well, it specifically has to do with the campaign mode of the game.  During this setting you'll be tossed random missions from time to time.  Completing missions gets you money, research points, and occasionally even parts for your crafting.  These missions usually have a requirement that goes along with your available technology.  Oh, did I forget to mention?  Yea, most of the technology is locked behind research.  Thus the research points.  At times you might even be tossed missions that you aren't capable of doing because you decided to follow one tech tree and ignore another.  For example, being required to rescue a submariner trapped in his submarine, when you don't have dive gear yet.  When this happens you have to either forgo the mission, or figure out a creative build to get the job done (like maybe a claw on a winch to grab the sub and bring it to the surface?)

So the catch is this.  You'll be endlessly building, which requires endlessly doing missions to make money and earn research/parts.  Don't think you can come up with one ship design that will do it all either, because it won't happen.  The second you setup a ship to do one thing, it'll need you to do something totally different and thus build another ship, or helicopter, or airplane.  You'll never have a ""can do it all"" vehicle.  Believe me, I tried.

Ok, so it's not much of a catch... That's actually where the fun is in this game.  Coming up with endless creative designs to ""get the job done"".  On top of that, the physics engine is rather exceptional.  I've never seen better water dynamics in a video game.  Everything from waves to currents has been very well done, and even how water behaves in storage tanks.  Flood your ship?  It'll sink.  Make a solid ship?  It'll sink.  You have to design your ship with enough air pockets that it'll stay afloat, but not too much so it'll float high and be unstable...  Ballast is also a thing, you can use pumps and actually setup true to life ballast tank systems.  Oh, and did I mention the logic?  Not just connecting switches to lights, but there is also a full array of ""And"", ""Or"", ""Not"" and other logic gates that allow you to literally build whatever you want.

This game is, quite frankly, the best all-around building game I've ever played.  It should be a top rated game once it's optimized and out of early access.  At least that's where it's popularity should reach.  What are you waiting for?

86,69716940,english,"Im going to review this again after more than 300 hrs played. I return to this sim very often as I think it is the best boat sim ever. BUT, there are still some really annoying things with it:

1.- PERFORMANCE: Unless you have a super end state of the art PC, FPS will drop so much when you load a detailed boat thay will make you press ALT+F4 immediatly

2.- The fact that is so difficult to move through the scenery: unable to climb ladders and not falling again and again, cant teleport to an existing vessel ending in having many unreacheable spawned boats, faulty ilumination even at noon (you always need your spot light on), not having workbenches where you really need em, harbours with no ladders if you fall in the water... add a low fps to this and you will have a really annoying experience.

3.- Spawning vehicles system is horrible through these workbenches.  At least in creative mode you should be able to do more things and having more movement freedom.

4.- MAP is huge and even has no detail at all I like it, but: Why do we have this FOW if all sceneries are the same for every player? Is not possible to add a ""Remove FOW"" or ""Discover map"" option?

I could be hours writing features that should be improved in this game. I love it, but it needs much more development...

Hard days work over i decide to go to sleep. I am awakened to find out a sailor is sick aboard a remote tanker and needs medical treatment. I spring into action, the night is dark and stormy and only the lightening punctuates the blackened skies. I'm 300m away from the tanker but all i see is pitch darkness then, BOOM the sky is saturated by a strike of lightening, I see a large oil tanker with a red distress flare emitting a red glow.

Really worth the money, but do keep in mind for those who is deciding whether to buy this or not is that you need to give this game some patience. It needs some optimization and better servers, played with a friend from Indonesia, both of us in asia region and it lagged like hell. Overall I still enjoy this game.

Edit: Disregard the top, the game went downhill real fast with a previous update.

1.Cant optimize the game properly since the launch of multiplayer update to prevent random crashes, making the experience not smooth at all.
2.Unplayable despite the FPS caps by the server leading to everyone only being able to spawn small vehicles to prevent the server from dying (Stormworker for instance).
3.Not fixing the game or do an overhaul to the game's engine to make it run smoother since the launch of multiplayer, they should have expected the problems multiplayer would do to the game but chose not to act.
4.Taking only the suggestions of the community by only adding more to the game but not going back to see what is wrong.
5.Sadly I have to say that I cannot recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a game with the similar genre.

It's addictive, in the sense that there's a never ending need to explore the entire map and it's fun, too! You can choose from hundreds, maybe thousands of parts to create ANYTHING and if you aren't too good at that then you can check out community creations.

Plus, the game runs well on pretty much any device, 32 or 64 bit, cheap or expensive so you don't have to break the bank to have a good time. 

The only drawback is the game its self is 32 bit, meaning it has weird core utilisation so you do need a high-end cpu to run big creations without slowing the game down.

That's what I thought it was when i first discovered this game. 


What lies under the hood, however, is the most complex, deep, and robust vehicle creation system I have ever experienced. 


I'm 93 hours in, and i'm just scratching the surface of what's possible in this game. 


This is what some people made in the game from scratch:

1.) a remote controlled drone with a built in camera transmitting the feed to a monitor. 
2.) A helicopter pad on a ship that is fully retractable, and can be controlled remotely by the helicopter
3.) Radios that can send messages back and forth to other players in the game. The messages show up on in-game monitors, and can be transmitted using in-game keypads
4.) A windmill that automatically directs itself against the wind, thus producing energy for your creations. 
5.) A giant vessel with a runway that can fly in the sky, similar to the helicarrier from the avengers. 


Robotic hinges/pivots, lua prgramming, composite data, electric/mechanical components, microprocessors, etc. This game gives you a set of tools, and you can utilize them to make pretty much anything you want.

Games like Kerbal Space Program, Simple Planes and Brick Rigs get close, but (with the exception of KSP) they never got their hooks into me.  

Stormworks however has me hooked like no other game.  The level of freedom that you have to make what ever you want is outstanding.  Wanna make a amphibious Tank?  Go for it.  Jet Powered Train that can go 600mph?  Sure.  A flyable Submarine?  Uhhhh I'm working on it (It sinks fine, just doesn't... un-sink).

I highly recommend starting the game with advanced mechanics off until you get a hang of building and general controls first, but the moment you're confident enough with the game turn on Advanced mechanics.

It's and Alpha so my ""No"" recommendation is for now.  If you don't mind putting hours into creating a vehicle, run that vehicle for hours then have some random bug break it, then absolutely play this game now.  The technical detail in vehicle builds is amazing, testing seasoned technicians with building their own logic controllers etc.   However these builds take a lot of hours to complete.  I have had two ships that I built, and they really performed well that have broke with no easy fix now.  The first I added a stand alone custom tank to, not integrated with the ships fuel system.  The second I change my medium size fuel tanks out for large tanks.  In both cases the ship simply will not start.  I have checked and checked all connections / controls etc on both ships for too many hours now.  There in lies my reasoning for the ""No"" rating.  

Secondly, game play bugs are plenty at this stage in development too.  Tanking liquids for money is a prime example.  Build a tanker and take it out for a few runs, you'll soon be frustrated.  Your first run will work without a hitch but the second you'll have a hard time offloading, pumps have to be turned on and off to offload, and the sell point leaves a miniscule amount in your tank that you can't pump out.  This means you're now stuck with only carrying the last fluid type in your tanks as the sell points won't say put crude oil in when you have .06 diesel in there.  The only workaround at the moment is to take the tanker back to the shop despawn and respawn after your first run.  Again, here in is my reasoning for the ""No"" rating.

I admit that with only 6 hours on the clock, MC, SE and KSP are hard comparison especially given the development that have gone into these games.

The missions so far have been interesting and varied, they open up as you unlock further islands within the game and your selection of parts increases. 

Games that have the freedom of Stormworks but still manage to provide the player with a satisfying progression arc and interesting objectives are really rare.

I moved from boats to air vehicles as the focus of my designs and I feel unrewarded in both categories.
There is nor gliding in this game, hence the physics for airplanes are inherently broken and most of the lift essentially comes from an engines that constantly overheating without the bugged 1x3 custom water tank. 

I wanted to make racing style airplanes, but the components that you need to make them flyable are big and destroy beautiful designs that work in the real world. Yet the way Physics works in this game, shows that your fun design that has a real life influence won't take off.

To have all of the fun in this game, you will have to make: 
- A ships that has to do everything. Bigger ships tank the FPS.
- A plane with jet engines, or a normal engine that is full throttle all of the time.
- A helicopter, which is the only clear way to complete most of the campaign missions.

Making any vehicle that is fun is out of the question, and I hope that you're the type of person that likes to spend 2 full days on one vehicle design, then spend the next 40 minutes floating or flying around in a broken physics engine across a vague and uninteresting landscape.

There is a level of the community that wants the physics fixed. Yet, the developers seem to be working on the campaign that has impossible mission time constraints.

If you are willing to put in the hard yards on a virtual engineering degree, you will love this game.
If you are looking for something that isn't a full time job, look elsewhere.

TL;DR; Build vehicles, complete missions, has PVP/COOP multiplayer. Easy to learn, difficult to master. Superb complexity, nice UI. It's EA, has rough edges but gets regular updates clearly made with love from the devs.

 The premise of the game is that you are Search And Rescue (SAR), but you don't have any vehicles or tools - you have to build them. To borrow the words of the Youtuber Squirrel - ""this game gives you a reason to build things."" However, the ""storm"" in Stormworks means that sea is not your friend. There's fog, wind, rain, big waves, it's cold, sharks, etc. Your vehicle needs to survive if you're going to survive.

Please take a look at the workshop for a peek at what people have built. It's astonishing - and those vehicles aren't just pretty. They have outstanding complexity. For technical folks, there's an oustanding set of logic pieces to program fascinating machines. There's radar, lidar, lasers (not the scifi kind), sonar, etc.

The bad news? It's Early Access. There's rough edges. The mission system is being worked on to create more flavor and spice. The fidelty of some things like the characters needs some love. There's no tutorials - this bites because if you start with advanced difficulty your going to get stuck on some aspect that needs more self-explanation. Youtubers like Squrrel, MrNJersey and Stealth17 have great tutorials. The Discord community offers some help, and the devs post a lot. So - all of that offers some solace.

You can't just build a ship with open deck, it will sink! The damn thing needs to have seal compartments to stay afloat! Can't even build a canoe FFS! 

So my suggestion for the developers, -
please address the basics like buoyancy ( an open ship should float! and sit lower if loaded,) and make ships displace water away from the hull, some work still need to be done for the fluid mechanics to be correct, i want my ship to stay afloat like a real ship, i want to have to use bilge pumps if needed etc.  Anyways, if this single irritant get addressed, this game would be THE greatest game in my mind.

there are 2 sides to the game:
1: building-This part of the game is thriving with an active community creating some amazing vehicles. The developers are always adding and updating the components available.  
2: Missions-You will see a lot of people unhappy with the level of missions in the game at present and while I agree this is an area that, as I understand it, will become a focus once the build and world is complete.

The ""advanced"" mode is really the only mode worth using as it is the most supported by other players and the developers. There is a steep learning curve to learn how to build in this mode if you have never used such a system. there is a vast network of support available on the Discord and steam discussion.

 Would highly recommend

As part of an air, sea rescue organisation, you need the right vehicles and tools for the job hence the design.  

I'm not saying these other games gave no goal but rather STORMWORKS provides more of an immediate motivation for certain things.   Need to transport that relief worker to that base on the other side of the map but running out of fuel?  Time to learn about fuel efficiency!  In this respect its quite like Kerbal Space Program.

The depth of the game is outstanding, I was blown away by the way components are wired up both electrically and data channel-wise and then again when I discovered the logic/circuit board stuff.  The fact that some clever people have made auto-pilots for helicopters is a testament to the potential and freedom of this game.

This game is not only educational but also incredibly addictive and fun.  Whilst Factorio taught me all about logistic efficiency and circuit networks, STORMWORKS teaches me engine RPM, torque, fuel efficiency and how to safe souls at sea.

I should clarify that i have some experience with this because i'm an admin on a dedicated multiplayer server.
First of all, the crashes. Oh dear god, the crashes. It doesn't crash very often in singleplayer, but in multiplayer, constant crashes. I literally do mean CONSTANT. 

You send a chat message and the game doesn't like it? Crash. You spawn a vehicle in a workbench and the game just doesn't like you? Freeze or crash. You adjust a keypad? Crash. You look at this buggy pile of dogshit the wrong way? Server crash. Literally anything happens? Crash. You're doing something cool? Crash, plus many, many more i haven't named.


But don't take it from me. This is what the owner of the server i'm on said about this's game's crashing:
""It makes my pp soft""
""I just don't like that the server can be 50 out of 60 fps, a few good vehicles, and the game still crashes""
 
At the time of writing this review, i only played for a few hours, and i must have crashed a minimum of 10 times.

I talked with someone today. They said that they wouldn't listen to him about the crashes because it didn't make a crash log. He also said someone named ""Ra Ra Rasputin"" was being quite rude.
They recently released an update claiming they ""Fixed"" the blank message crash. Their ""Fix"" was not showing the blank message in chat. It doesn't stop you from crashing AT ALL. It literally just doesn't show the blank message that indicates the crash.

The optimization is dog shit. The owner of the server i'm an admin on said that even when the FPS is 10 on the server, the CPU usage never goes above 17%. It never uses more than 3GB of the 12GB RAM at 3200 MHz.
Stormworks devs, I don't want ""First person ropes"" or custom winches. I want your goddamn game to be tolerable in Multiplayer. People are always saying ""Oh it's just an early access game, there are going to be bugs"" This is Bethesda level shit. They didn't get a pass when they released the FO76 beta, why should these devs?

I hate to be that guy, but releasing a feature like this, even in early access, is fucking bonkers.

23,65806502,english,"Alright after 60 hours i think i am ready to make a review of this game. First of all this is a really fun and an addictive game, it definetly needs some fixes. The game at it's current state is stable and playable but you do need a good system to run it smoothly. However this will probably change in the future since its not that optimized at its current state. The game is really smooth and fun in single player mode.
Now, multiplayer is a different gameplay experience. Its fun but really unstable, when playing with friends the game is very unstable massive input lag spikes and the game slows down beacuse its really not that optimized for multiplayer especially for big creations. However i still love playing in single player mode.
The game has a slight learning curve but once you get the hang of it its really easy to create a vehicle.
The map is really huge and there is wildlife which is nice. The game's graphics are really nice even though there's very low amount of textures in the game. But i think its perfect for a polygon based game. There is no round shapes in the game so no curves, only wedges. The water is well animated. Which reminds me the weather settings are really well done. There's even a tsunami spawn option which is really fun to ride with a boat however its really not that tall they need to change that. There's even a wind option where you can set the strength of its drag, and the waves on the water get alot bigger and rough. You can also set the rain strength. Its really fun to be on a boat when there is a thunder and a tsunami is coming it really makes the game come to life also the sound effects are really good!
That's about it for my final rating i'd give it a 8/10 beacuse of the bugs and crashes and it needs more content.",1585165445,1585581089,True,1,0,0.528985500335693359,0,True,False,True,76561198044035139,84,7,5401,0,1194,1600364520,,

They have finaly made the servers playabel without chrashing the game every 5min.

But I have stress tested the physics engine of this game for a long time.

For the most part the physics is quite good but under certain conditions the results where not to great but it was quite axeptebel because it was not to important stuff that failed.

(things like grapics glitching out when going 12000km/h)



The thing that got me annoyid where the bugs that I discovred while going  at 200km/h.

The bug was that the car would just start spinning around for no reason after a sharp turn and would not stop as long as the engine was producing power while the terrain was completly flat and just as a side note I was not tutching any controls like yaw, a nother thing that is wierd is that the glitch would stop if I reversed the car witch makes no sense.

A diffrent glitch is that buttons you look at while spining around at high speeds do not let you control them



If you think I am to harsch while analysing this game then i have one thing to say

6,64445617,english,"I wish I could give something between a ""Recommended"" and ""Not Recommended"" but leans more towards Recommended. The concept, gameplay, almost everything is absolutely great. The concept of being a coastguard and being able to build anything, I mean ANYTHING is something I've never seen before. Onto the gameplay, it's amazing as well. As I said, you are able to build anything you want, if you have the skills that is. Every component, every block, every mechanics, has their own different functions that completes each other. Want to build a speedboat? Sure. Spaceship? Go ahead. An exact scale replica of Battleship Yamato with fully functional cannons and torpedoes? Say no more. The possibility is endless. The only limit is your skills and imagination.

Now into deeper details and technical stuff. The graphics and art style is absolutely great and works together very well. The flat-color low poly style mixed with soft lighting is something very lovely to look at. Not to mention dynamic weather and daylight cycle which is a nice feature. The physics are great, but aircraft physics could've gotten some more realism put into it. Multiplayer isn't that great, it's pretty unstable, lags often, and even makes the game crash pretty often (and is really annoying). But good on the devs that are still working on it. The performance isn't low-end friendly, it could've been more optimized, in fact. But I guess it's quite understandable, as the game is still going on early access. I wouldn't recommend running it on low-end PCs though.

What a fantastic game. I'm going to try to avoid using too many superlatives in this review, but the fact that I have to do so should be indicative of its value.  Only a week or two before I became aware of Stormworks, I was musing to myself that some sort of coast guard/salvage operation game set at sea would be great fun; this game is so much more than that already. With the development team releasing nearly weekly minor updates this is the best value for money I have had in a game for a long time. Well done to the devs and thanks to the vibrant community! Do yourself a favour and buy this game.

UPDATE

As 3000 hours approach, and my time in this game is now double that of a previous record holder (KSP) I thought I ought to write once again about how this game is the best game ever made.

If you like the idea of a coast guard style game where you have to brave the elements to rescue those in need, this is the game for you. If you prefer building vehicles, solving complex mechanical, logical, and logistical problems; this is the game for you. If what you really want to do is build your base like you used to do in Minecraft, but with moving parts and monitors and comparatively high resolution, this is the game for you.

In short, it can be whatever you want it be (as long as what you want it to be isn't a combat simulator). Considering I passed the one cent per hour mark 700 hours ago, if you like any of the above you should get similarly mind-boggling value out of what is, I repeat, the best game ever made.",1544309647,1582878008,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True,76561198014104769,171,1,228818,8019,34298,1602035139,,

79,55137354,english,"Stormworks build and rescue is a lot of fun, but its also mind numbingly boring.

How is this game both fun and boring? building things is fun, seeing if what you built works is rewording, then bashing it agents tsunamis and megalodons is always a treat. you will find yourself spending hours in creative and if your really looking for a building game for primarily for ships I highly recommend this.
How is this boring it sounds like a blast right? Its when you get to the traveling, going anywhere takes forever thats not bad I like an adventure that takes some time but based on how powerful your ship is and the layout of the world's seed it can take around 30 minutes to an hour through empty boring ocean to get anywhere meaningful.

Saying the map is big is an under statement  

You made it to the main Donkk island and you want to get to the Arctic? Your looking at a three and half hour journey by train. ships are a little slower then trains. planes are the fastest mode of transportation in the game but are highly finicky. you can also build cars but unless your on Donkk Island you have very little reason to use them anywhere else.

What do you get for your long journey at sea when you finally reach a place like the Arctic or the isles of Donkk? not a crazy lot most of the islands you'll find are quite flat and barren unless its a terminal. 
The main island of Donkk has two terminals one is a little airport and the other is a train shipping yard with a dock for large ships the rest of the island though is nearly completely empty other then the two VERY small villages one of which is unnamed and compared to the rest of the island are very decorated and lively. 

The islands are so bare they don't even have trees other then for the rare big dead oak tree on about two or three small islands. the reason I feel this is so important is the fact that after you've been at sea for say an hour and then you see an island you have no incentive to dock and explore because you don't feel like you arrived anywhere.

The main con of this game is the fact it feels so empty outside of the building and thats sad because the building is this game's best feature and it does it really well but whats the point of building a massive ship if you have nowhere to go.

 here is a list of things I'd like to see for the future that I feel would help with the empty world problem

1. Adding trees to the islands. ""Update! This has been added!""

2.Adding a full fledged town with a terminal meant for cars and missions based around the town, ""Update! this has been kinda added but I feel like it can be improved on""

3.Adding a world option for NPC controlled ships to freely roam the seas, I know that not every computer could handle two or three large ships being near by thats why I feel this would work best as a option when creating new worlds. the option to have other ships at sea with you would make the ocean less empty and would make traveling for long periods of time more enjoyable.

4 and 5 are more for fun.

4.adding Flare Guns, ""Update! This has been added!""

5.add some civilian style clothes and hairstyles. my lady needs a floppy hat, a sundress, and a new pair of heals if she has ANY chance of putting out that oil fire!

Content-wise this is a no-brainer. However, I would never enjoy this alone, and the horrible MP performance is really disappointing me and my friend. It's been a pure suffering.

Still, RECOMMENDED if you are looking for MP gameplay and have confidence in you & your friends' p2p connections.



Look, I still wish to enjoy this game. Plz at least don't freeze the game in the building workshop under unstable connections? Is that too much?

*Literally just saw the MP update, going to try it later today, fck yeah! (Not out yet, will see)

*The update is a disappointment. Instead of the whole game slowing down, now the game only slows the results of your actions. It still takes me literally two minutes to open the cabin door; instead of the door slowly opening for a long while, now it takes a long while until the door suddenly decides to swing open. I was also teleported back to bed from the hanger once, 2 minutes after I tried to go to bed and failing. My friend saw my character model running while lying on the bed. (Japan-China, private dedicated server with a direct lag of 80ms. Yet the in-game lag still managed to reach over 2 minutes. I and my friend can enjoy DCS from the same server without any problem, wth)

45,62416915,english,"Stormworks is a weird mix of awesome and horrible. Sometimes when I play it, I'm having a great time driving a small rescue vessel or flying a helicopter. Other times the game is extremely slow or just crashes out of nowhere.

In this game, you build vehicles to accomplish a task or just explore the ocean. Or you play the same way I do and just download the top-rated vehicles on the Workshop, only to find out the boat was buildt in 2018 and no longer works as it should, and snaps in half and sinks.

With its huge open world and near infinitely generating world, it's a blast to explore until you realize the islands are being copied over and over again. Then you see a huge fin in the background, only to have your cruise ship capsize and your spirit crushed, as you get banished to the desktop.

That's my biggest problem with this game. It's the most unstable game I've ever played. While stable when using smaller creations, the bigger stuff will make your game play in slow-motion, or just crash to desktop the second it loads. That or it will crash out of nowhere while you're sailing in your small fishing trawler.

Now, this game is still very much early access, so it still has some problems to work out. Other than the less-than rare crashes to desktop, Stormworks is a great game with a very active Workshop, and some incredible creators. I would go as far as to say the Workshop creations are what makes this game. Creations like huge cruise ships, submarine aircraft carriers and incredible vtol aircraft are what almost makes all the crashes worth it. Almost.

Overall, Stormworks is a great game with a lot to explore, and even more to explore in the Workshop. Add the crashes, and the game drops to being a good game. Buy it if you are interested in boats, the ocean, or are interested in the Workshop creations. Just make sure your PC can handle it.",1580000522,1582286498,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True,76561198257670248,34,12,31189,1920,16450,1601760536,,

This game is not perfect by any stretch of the imagination.  In fact, I would hesitate to call it a game at all in its current state.  The fun of Stormworks right now lies solely in its building mechanics.  How fast can you make a boat?  Can you even make a helicopter that can fly?  Building your own vehicles in a semi-realistic physics environment is a blast—especially for people who were obsessed with titles like Kerbal Space Program (like I was).  

Unlike Kerbal, in its current state Stormworks gameplay is severely lacking.  One should consider the missions to merely be tests for the capabilities of the vehicles you build.  There is no real story or motivating factors other than research.  ALL of the fun lies in constantly building and refining/tailoring your vehicles to perform specific tasks.
Advanced mode is the only way to go to really enjoy this in its current state.  The feeling of dumping 10+ hours into a helicopter build after dozens of rounds of test flights, and then finally accomplishing a mission with it is rivaled only by the feeling in Kerbal Space Program when you finally successfully land on the Mun.  The game is hard and takes many hours of trial and error, YouTubing, and reading to get your vehicles in good working order—but man do you feel great when it all comes together.  

I love this game and can’t wait to see where they take it!

My only gripe is that the barrier to entry is steep, given the shear complexity of of the building tools (i.e you can build anything from trains to speed boats to cruise liners) and given the detailed engine functionality (especially in advance mode) the initial few hours are a nightmare - at time of writing i'm C.20 hours in and have only just got a fully functioning ship designed, trailed and built - I fully accept that a tutorial would not cover all areas so would suggest some sort of in game encyclopedia, this would replace the miriad of youtube and forum posts that need be viewed to grasp some of the concepts. 

This all being said the complexity is required and the game (once understood) is ace - 9/10 will easily provide 100+ hours entertainment.

89,62951090,english,"     I thought Stormworks would be a coastguard sim with a few light building and creative mechanics thrown in.  I couldn't have been more wrong.  It's actually the greatest, most detailed model building game that's ever existed.

     Whether we're talking aesthetics or engineering, the scale and depth of Stormworks is absolutely incredible.  At half the size of the smallest block in Space Engineers, Stormworks allows you to build small.  Of course you can build huge ships, planes, cars, submarines, helicopters, and even trains, but you can fill them with a level of aesthetic detail that's impossible in any other building game.

     That's not where it ends though.  The actual engineering in Stormworks puts Space ""Engineers"" to shame, and I love Space Engineers, and I mean 3,000 hours love it.  Where most games would give you an engine or power block and call it a day, Stormworks allows you to create your own cooling systems, electrical systems, fuel systems, air intakes, gearboxes, clutches, all with a nice sprinkling of options and sliders to adjust them to your preferences.

     But it doesn't end there... Hooking these components together is just the beginning.  Stormworks gives you the option to make these systems do EXACTLY what you want with a powerful and intuitive logic editor or Lua programming.  Want to add interior lights that come on when you open the door to your car?  Want a door chime?  Do you want a climate control system that you've designed yourself?  Want a crane to deploy your lifeboat if your ship starts to sink?  The creative options in this game are endless.  Truly endless.  Like I said, the depth of this game is like nothing else.  There is almost nothing you can't build, almost nothing you can't do in this game.

     Oh, and there are also cameras.  And monitors that display video.  In real time.  You can remotely control things and talk to your friends on the radio that you've built yourself.  I could write a novel about how much I love this game, but you should really play it for yourself.

     Long story short, if you're looking for the best building game on Steam or anywhere, or if you just want a game that allows you to sail beautifully detailed ships and drive interesting vehicles, you've found it.  Buy it right now.  Tell someone else to buy it right now.  Saying I can't recommend Stormworks enough is underselling it, and that's the truth.  Of all the games I own and play, I've only ever written a review for one:  Space Engineers.  It's an amazing game.  I love it dearly, and Stormworks absolutely blows it away.",1580807066,1580807066,True,124,1,0.909255564212799072,13,True,False,True,76561197978979005,101,4,114433,634,80799,1602041453,,

2,62874030,english,"[h1] Overview [/h1]
Overall, Stormworks is a game with a lot of potential. It is still in development, which is very much noticable when playing the game, but I am enjoying the game when I play it nonetheless - especially the creative part, designing not only boats, but planes, cars, helicopters or new, crazy designs no one thought of before. The building system is in general well made and you have a lot of creative freedom. 

[h1] Missions/Survival Gameplay [/h1]
The missions in Stormworks do leave a bit to be desired. The NPC's are very barebones, they are mostly just dummies that can at most follow you around when asked to. The missions system [i] is [/i] being remade however, so we will see what evolves into. Still, they are not horrible, but I feel like there is a lot more potential here! Right now, I mostly just make designs in creative and I get the impression that this is the case for most players.
   I am a volontary sea rescuer in Sweden (SSRS, google it if you want to see what it is) and from that perspective it is worth noting that the missions are semi-realistic at best. The most common thing we do is to go out to people who are stranded with engine troubles and whatnot, meaning we have to tow them back to the dock where they can look over their boat. Right now, there is no realistic way of towing crafts. If it doesn't have a connector that lets you connect the ship securely, you need to rely on silly magnets that can easily get lose. And hey, getting it on there in the first place is a challenge in its own. They tend to end up in the water, sinking down to the bottom of the ocean. It doesn't feel complete and it doesn't feel realistic.

[h1] Creative/Ship Building [/h1]
To start off here, we need to get something clear. There are two modes in which you can design your ships and play in: the standard, easy one where you can simply place an engine and it just works. Then, there is the ""advanced mode"", which in my opinion is the one you should be playing, but it is also, understandably, quite a bit harder. You may need to spend a substantial amount of time to get things to work as you want them to, especially in the beginning. You should be able to put together some basic stuff after watching some youtube tutorials though, and setting up an engine and using the ""composite"" nodes and other things to set up control panels and advanced ship systems will become fairly second nature when you have played around a bit with it.
   My favourite part about Stormworks is the possibilties it offers - the creative freedom in the building system. You can script, make remote controlled drones, set up advanced control panels, radars, GPS systems, autopilots, autohovering and so much more. Pretty much anything you can imagine, you can also create if you put in the time for it.

[h1] Performance [/h1]
The topic of performance is always a fairly important one in games, and even more so in sandbox games where you build large, physics based creations. Stormworks is a 32-bit game, which does not help. I personally don't have much issues, but my hardware consists of a 2080 and an i7 9700K and so on... I never experience any lag with the highest settings while doing sensible things, but I know a lot of people do even with lower settings - physics calculations on this scale needs some beefy hardware and good optimization. 32-bit isn't exactly helping here.

[h1] Graphics [/h1]
Having already talked about the performance of the game, it is only right we talk a bit about the actual looks of the game. I must admin, I am a bit split here. Stormworks can look good. I love the way the ocean looks and the art style overall looks decent. Sometimes, the graphics are a bit too simple for my taste though. It is not a game because it is beautiful, because it rarely really is. I wouldn't say, on the other hand, that the graphics are a turn-off in any way either - the overall looks of the game are still ok. Ok is a pretty good word the describe the graphics of this game to be honest. Ok.

[h1] The Future of Stormworks [/h1]
I wanted to bring up the topic of what the future might bring for Stormworks and the developers behind it. First off, I want to say that the developers are making a fantastic job of constantly pushing updates. They are a small team, but yet they manage to release something almost every week, in addition to more major updates every once in a while. They are good at listening to the community and it is clear that they are passionate about the game. They are not perfect, but they want to bring something unique to the table. At least in my book, they are certainly succeding on that point.
   Multiplayer was announced to be the focus of the next major update, which I am glad to see. The performance in multiplayer right now is horrible. If one player has a slow PC that cannot cope with the calculations, the simulation speed is slower for everyone connected. This will change. Personally, I am hoping for the possibility of dedicated servers that could be hosted by the community.

[h1] Should you buy it? [/h1]
Do you want a game to sink into on a saturday evening with some good music in your ears to build that cool boat you saw at the dock yesterday? Or maybe make that nice plane design you always wanted to make a reality somehow real. Stormworks is unique and it is unique in a good way. I like it. If you're like me and like to build stuff, I'm pretty sure you will too. Besides, it's not that expensive. Pick it up and see for yourself! Just remember not to give up from the beginning, it may seem a bit daunting to you if you are not used to these kinds of games. Once you get into making the more advanced stuff, it's a hell of a lot of fun though!

If you read this far, thank you! I certainly hope I helped you out a bit in deciding whether to get into the rather addictive world of Stormworks.",1580668238,1580668255,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True,76561198153380822,36,4,33459,2431,6972,1602057657,,

25,62799056,english,"Probably one of the best Early acces game i've played. 
The building is great, takes a few hours to get used to rotations tho, but it is worth it.

I played my most hours in this game a while ago, i stopped because i felt the game isnt really completed yet, and lacks alot of features i'd like from their ""roadmap/suggestion box"" 

I usually play multiplayer
It's fun for a while, but it simply lacks content. 

The stuff i miss in this game
-A more detailed/adjustable wave configuration
-More detailed damaging model, not just a grey dot/scratch who pours alow  amount of water into the ship.
^ With more detailed damage model, one could have way more  fun using water tight doors,  etc and i would think more people would construct more advanced  pumps pumping out the water.
Not only way more fun, but it would challenge builders.

The devs are great. They fix major flaws quick and good.
Most of the updates are high quality, but it feels like alot of the updates is almost nothing.
Like the megalodons, i think they are bad, like the AI is just  weird. Should be a better interface also while spawning megalodons etc.

Its a great game, but lacks content. It's early acces tho, so nothing else expected.
It supports workshop, which is a very nice thing to have. 
As said earlier, its one of the best early access games.

38,62759467,english,"My current computer is nothing of the gaming sort so I cannot experience the full game until my new one arrives, will update my review once it does.

Okay so this game honestly is everything I've looked for, its got custom building where you decide how complicated or simple your craft shall be, the Simple mode is very useful for beginners, when later on you can go to Advanced which is where the real fun happens.

The overall physics of the game are very satisfying, and the different features like flares, cameras, open up unlimited possibilities, I saw someone make a cockpit with no windows, instead he used cameras and screens. 

This game lets you create any type vehicle, submarine, boat, jet, shield helicarrier, you name it, its possible.

I no longer dis like anything about this game, the only issue was multiplayer but they've heavily improved it, overall worth the damn money, but make sure to get some friends on board, everything gets a lot better with a mate to come with you. 

Oh and the career mode is very good, its not too easy, but its not too hard as well. You have to complete rescue or service missions with your own craft to make money and unlock more components, allowing for a very exciting gameplay experience, and roleplay is a lot of fun in this game too

I won't say too much more, you experience it for yourself, but trust me, if you're into a space engineers / kerbal space program on land, this game will be perfect, but for anyone not into those games, its still worth a try.

Old review:
[i]Can't recommend it YET. 
It's a very good vehicle building game. Amazing, really. With logic, circuits, advanced machinery. But so was Space Engineers, and just like Space Engineers, there is next to nothing to do with those vehicles so far. Most missions are extremely simple. Go here, pick up this person, move them there. Go here, extinguish this fire source that won't even spread, do that before timer runs out. 

They keep adding blocks which is neat, but we need better campaign mechanics for the game to be enjoyable.[/i]",1559895986,1579867791,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,True,76561198026976953,266,80,16514,3006,2919,1601671518,,

So is this less fun than FTD (From the Depths)? Could be, but the mission system makes up a fair bit of the fun. There is some basic career mode with progressing and uncovering the map.

21,51197500,english,"""Despite the bugs I really like this game, it's fun.""--> (Me in June of 2019 only 6 hours played) Now I have had more experience in Stormworks' nature playing for as long as 6...HUNDRED and 90 hours.

 I have experienced lots of game crashes (probably because of either my computer, early access reasons, or maybe even both) that I have gotten used to appreciating them a bit more and just think it's like ""daily lag.""

 Besides the game crashes, the stuff you can do in this game is amazing. For example, an immense thank you to GERUNIMO for building his ""Calypso"" owned by the legendary Cousteau, GERUNIMO probably put the most complicated engine startup procedure, to exist, on the ship. It was really frustrating at first but you know, beginners when it comes to the ""Triangle of Confusion"" which yes I made up lol. It inspired me to build a vessel similar to his only a few minor and even major differences, an easier engine startup procedure included, because I still got a lot to learn from the ""God of Engines and Electricity."" 

Furthermore, stuff like JPShips' massive yet interior lacking ""Titanic,"" just immense. Of course there is hardly any interior in there, but putting so much in the ship would kinda make sense to why it would lag. From small ships yet with engine startup procedures that make your brain rage in confusion to humongous creations like JPShips' ""Queen Mary"" that could probably tower over the Empire State Building lengthwise, let's face it, regardless of what the game tortures you with, you can basically do anything you set your mind to.

 I would also like to point out that the game also sometimes forgets what physics is, when I used GBDanny's ""Canopus"" and sank it, it split in two and the bow stood on the mast of the stern. Of course, it did collapse at some point, but why did it have to stand on that one mast first? 

The speed of creations is also basically ""unlimited"" in this game, GBDanny's ""Exocet"" could sail at a whopping 135 knots. Of course it had hydrofoils, but even his last hydrofoil ship never went that fast, at least I think. 

In conclusion, there is probably other stuff to talk about but I am too lazy to do so lol. However again, in conclusion, despite it's bugs and game crashes like I said in June of 2019, I see Stormworks as a game everyone, who loves engine making and all that jazz, will play in the future. Again, the bugs are understandable, this game is still in early access, or maybe it is just my computer is all. However, if you want a cheaper price but a full release, I suggest getting the game in early access but waiting until full release; prices will increase once the game is completely finished. All in all, I suggest those who like this stuff to play this game.",1560385119,1578812841,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,True,76561198278942547,14,6,116545,4055,419,1602082216,,

Anyways this game is just what I have been looking for, it has the career mode so you have the research and progression of making money to progress into larger better equipped crafts. 

Multiplayer is fine compared to what me and friends lived with when Space Engineers first went to Multiplayer. Is the lag when people open research and such a pain sure. But something I hope the devs can sort out. 

The advance mode is what really has been keeping me so hooked on this game. Mainly because I love to test things and troubleshoot. With Hardcore mode it is punishing but when you build your first boat from nothing and you are out on the water and you do not sink before leaving the harbor that is a pretty great time.

Down side so far is the not being able to build together. My friends and I just used a stream in discord to work together as a work around for now. But once you expand from just 1 boat it is cool to kind of have your thing you mainly work on. One guy boats, another heli's another planes and so on.

75,61513661,english,"As an avid Space Engineers player , and a shipbuilder who works for an IOT company the concept of Stormworks made it an instabuy for me. 

It's almost like two games: 
The main game is exploring, adventuring, problem solving multiplayer game that you can play with a huge catalogue of player designed , satisfyingly complex vechicles, where you can choose if you want to play with easy to use 'automated' vechicles OR you can use vechicles that operate very like thier real life counterparts, (i.e. 12 steps just to start the main engines) the physics are good enough to make it fun, but not highly realistic so the joy comes from operating the vechicles.

The other game is a building game , which unfortunately is not multi user. The 3D building itself is in someways intuitive and efficient but requires getting use to. However this game excels in its logic building and ability to desing and build control and automation loops. I am not clever enough to master this element of the game but am totally amazed at what can be done, see Boka Vanguard ( a heavy lift ship by MrNJ that can be operated like its real life counterpart.

Good:

- The game lets you use your imagination, theres no limit and thats what I love about this game.
- The weekly updates, every week I never know what I expect from Stormworks, new blocks, new sensors? You never know!
- Most of everything in here is pretty realisitic! MOST.


Bad

- Still multiplayer connection issues and lags, but no nearly as bad as before.
- Career mode, ok so I feel like the missions are pretty okay, it's mostly about the danger... yeah, it's to easy to make it to point A to B. I want more danger, more sharks more IDK, just anything that'll try to sink my boat or will. TORNADOS? HURRICANES? Megladons spawn once in a blue moon, tsunami triggers on only one mission. That's honestly my biggest downfall really.
- This is something for new people and still for myself because I still don't know how to correctly use radio RX or even microcontrollers that good.. They need their own beginner tutorial for this stuff. I know theres TONS of YT videos to watch ( Which I have) some are OUTDATED and no longer work, so sometimes I feel stuck in a creation I can't complete.

60,46016112,english,"After around 1200 Hours it's probably time to give this game a small little Review. Due to the Game currently being in early access, things mentioned in the review might've changed by now. Written at game Version 0.9.20 (early 2020).

Starting off I'd say that this Game was worth the money I spent on it. If you're into vehicle sandbox games like Kerbal Space Programm, Besiege, Simple Planes and Space Engineers in a semi realistic environment then you should definetly give this game a try as well. 

[b]Gameplay and Building:[/b]
Building Mechanics are very simple, you can build your vehicles from basic blocks (a bit similar to minecraft but with 25cm blocks), shapes, mechanical parts etc. - This can either be used to create simple vehicles or complex master pieces full of moving parts to create more complex or smooth shapes. The games complex logic system allows to create a ton of useful features from full scale autopilots to working radar screens. It mainly consists out of simple Logic Blocks (that can also be arranged in a programmable micro processor) that are connected via a simple drag and drop system. (similar to scratch or programming learning tools). There's also lua scripting which allows for even more complex Logic. 
The current actual gameplay is a bit lackluster at the moment and mainly consists out of ""ferry"" missions (fly this there, deliver his to there, recover this ... etc). The main fun comes from actually playing around with your vehicles. There's a career mode which requires you to research components, manage your fuel etc., I personally play only creative due to the career missions getting boring quite quickly. 

[b]The World:[/b]
The World is a (somewhat) randomly arranged combination of pre-made Islands. It offers a pretty high variety of terrains (mostly water tho) and plenty of space to explore. Sadly the world feels very empty and lacks story telling. 

[b]Graphics:[/b]
The overall quality is very pleasing in my opinion, this is mainly achieved through the low poly look that works very consistently through the game. Reflections and Lighting are very beautiful and don't require to much hardware power. 

[b]Performance:[/b]
The Performance is quite okay. As long as you as you keep your Vehicles reasonable sized (and detailed) the performance stays very stable. When spawning a lot of vehicles or very complex vehicles the game speed will drop quite harshly tho. As long as you have a decent Computer you should be fine Performance wise. 
[Played on: i5-7500, nvidia 1050ti, 24gb RAM and on i7-9750h, nvidia 1650, 16gb RAM both averaging at around 60FPS with nothing to demanding being spawned]

[b]Multiplayer[/b]
Stormworks currently features Multiplayer via Steam Friends. There's no dedicated Servers and Multiplayer performance can be quite bad, especially when playing with someone who has a bad Internet connection or a bad pc .

[b]Early Access[/b]
In my opinion this game currently is what early access is supposed to be. There's regular updates, the devs listen to the community (not always but quite often) and there's quite a lot of stuff which get's broken regularly. Don't expect a final Product, expect a work in progress. 

[b]Realism[/b]
It's a game. Not a Simulator. Hydro / Aerodynamics are very cruedly implemented / simplified. There's only basic and generic components that wont allow for everything that you may want to build. - You usually have to adapt to the game mechanics when building real life things. The Water simulation is good and probably one of the best I've seen in the Indie / smaller game. Although it lacks in the actual Buoyancy simulation. There's no proper wakes or water displacement and vehicles will only float when they're air tight. 

[b]Conclusion[/b]
I would definetly recommend this if you like vehicle sandbox games. It lacks a bit of content in the actual gameplay department but the overall building mechanics are really good. The current Physics are working somewhat well but have a lot of room for improving.

The game stays fun by allowing you to change activities whenever you like.
Bored with boats? Make an airplane! Airplane crashed and started a forest fire? Start building a fire truck!
The missions are currently a bit bland and there's no real choice of what you get to do, but they are fun enough to keep you occupied and the devs are actively working on making improvements in the mission system.

The devs do an awesome job interacting with the community on discord and bringing weekly updates.
As always with early access games, things change, bugs happen but the devs are really quick on fixing game braking or majorly disliked changes.

My only annoyance with the community is people asking for weapons in a damn search and rescue game.
Luckily those people seem to have moved on or quieted down since the rocket update (the solid rocket boosters actually have some real utility like JATO and ejector seats).

Wow... Going on almost 2 years later with this review. The Devs have massively updated the game with so many new things. Honestly, stuff I didn't really think I needed or wanted in this game, but now I think ''I used to play Stormworks without this? How?'' 

If you are still one of those people that doesn't have this game, stop reading, go to the main game page, and smack that green BUY button.

I played the Beta when it came out, and played it every day. Recently Purchased the full game, and I am enjoying it.

I like how you're not limited to a certain vehicle type for missions. Want to rescue people while at the helm of a cargo ship? Go for it. Want to grab a Chinook and drop some research drones in the water? Sure. It's 2018, you do you.

88,60690555,english,"TL:DR Not necessarily a bad game, but too fiddly for me.

I bought the game with my primary interest being in performing search and rescue operations and have a decent to good degree of vehicle customization. With co-op available, I was hoping to also wrangle a couple of my old buddies into the game to pull off some missions in some stupidly designed flying machine. While that is all available, it ended up feeling to much like work to achieve it. After a hour and a half in game I had yet to successfully start a vehicle, much less do any missions and I lost interest. Is this the games fault? Not necessarily. I personally feel a tutorial on vehicle assembly is sorely needed as it really lacks the pick up and experiment gameplay of something like Kerbal Space Program. You need to know what you're doing before getting in the game proper or your're going to have a rough time. Also I feel the description page doesn't fully describe what is needed to build and operate a vehicle to perform the missions. The PC Gamer quote in particular felt a bit disingenuous to me. But it does have a very intricate logic and simulation system, so those with the knowledge and desire can do some amazing works in this game as demonstrated in the Steam Workshop. But when I realized I was rapidly approaching the 2 hour and had to come to a decision, which ended up being to ask for my first refund. It's just to fiddly to deal with when all I want to do it jump in, tweak a vehicle to environmental/mission conditions and do some SaR.",1577471322,1577471322,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True,76561197973075393,566,13,1191,0,90,1578336987,,

39,58950398,english,"I LOVE THIS GAME OK, I dont mean to hurt it in any way. Im going to let people know that frequent updates are not made and tested properly and frequent bugs happen almost everyday you will play. 

There is no point in asking the devs if they can add something you and your friends want because even after you ask for the most useful things that still give the players a challenge, they decide to add useless things like ""Ropes"" that do nothing but ""Look cool"" they are also very buggy and have broken my game more than once. 

Creators on the workshop are cool and very nice people but dont mess with their stuff because I and my friended creators have noticed they tend to overreact to items that are sometimes not theirs and end up getting your item banned just because they are ""more famous"" than you and ""deserve more"" than you, they should at least ask the item publisher if they have something that shows its their product than banning it unfairly on the spot. 

I dont mind how long an update will take to create, but the devs rush it and end up with more problems than there already was. I have noticed that every update seems to break the game more and more, I would like them in my opinion to work and test the product as long as possible and test everything to make sure that it is safe to publish.

I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO STATE THAT SHORTLY AFTER MY REVIEW, A SHARED IMAGE OF A SHIP I WAS WORKING ON, WAS REMOVED.

Survival: build your craft with limited resources and technology. Use that craft to complete missions and earn money and research points to further your tech and fund new vessels, then progress to air and land vehicles completing missions along the way in a fully simulated day/night dynamic weather environment that constantly changes in hostility.

Creative: build and spawn any craft you desire, tweak the weather to your needs or wants, spawn a tsunami and/or megaladon to spice it up, and break everything with no consequences!

Play exactly how you want to: adjust the difficulty by further limiting your starting cash, or disabling certain difficulties to make it slightly easier. You can choose whatever options you want, to suit your play style.

The game is beautiful, astounding at times when the sun rises or sets, or when your ship's traffic lights glisten in the night, underwater wonders, morning fog... crashing storm waves, it's just perfect. The only negative is with larger more complex ships lag isn't a problem, but sim speed is; add a few big craft and it begins to slow things down to an almost unplayable state.

52,59174491,english,"I would recommend this game to other players, because it is a fun game to play. At least, when you have a creativity greater than the lord himself or just really enjoy using other people's builds. If you are not good at building and you do not have any workshop creations, you're pretty much screwed. Keep that in mind. You will as a normal person need to be carried by other people's creations.

It most certainly requires good PC specs, because it takes a lot of frames to load big workshop builds. The community on Discord is absolutely amazing. You can contact the developers at any time if you have questions that cannot be answered by everyone who is in the Discord chat by default.

If you are here for the campaign, there is no campaign. There are a few missions tho and you can also download missions that other people made. You can also create them yourself, but I would suggest watching a tutorial, preferably by MrNJersey, before doing anything.

If you want to learn anything, join the official Stormworks Discord or watch some tutorials by MrNJersey. They are really helpful.

Now you might be thinking, hey, is there no multiplayer? Yes there is! The only downsight is that the connection will not be as pitch perfect as when you're playing Squad on a 40v40 player server. When you make a multiplayer game, you my friend, are the host. If you don't have that much RAM, you usually don't really have a lot when you have just a normal PC or laptop, don't run multiplayer games! Let the other guy run it. Running a multiplayer game requires a lot of RAM and a pretty stable internet connection.

If you don't have any friends to play with, this game might not be the best option, as you will not always run into a lot of people that want to play with you. (As I said, all servers are running on the PC of the guy that started the multiplayer world, so people don't do that very often.) If you are a lonewolf that likes to play alone and likes a quiet and abstract environment, this game will most likely be a go to!

That being said, the single player game or Lan game seem pretty stable but the MP really needs a dedicated server before anyone will start taking it seriously, at the moment it's using a steam peer to peer system and the sync is terrible and so are the lag and the disconnections and the crashing.
So if your looking for single player career mode or playing on a lan this is a quality buy.

It's slew of aerodynamic parts make aircraft fun to build and fly. Did I mention dynamic wind? It has train components and large rail systems that spawn in the world. It has wheeled AND tracked land based parts to build anything from sports cars to large tanks. It has fire fighting with fire suppression AND rescue. It has cold weather survival. It has sharks and a wonderful array of sea creatures. It has oil rigs which need crude oil shipped to processing facilities which will in turn produce diesel or jet fuel which you will be consuming. It has computer screens which you can program with lua code to display anything you want. It has all of this and functioning multiplayer.

What I love probably the most is the building aspect. Once you build, lets say a ship, you have to run the wiring, water lines, fuel lines, exhaust and air intake (On advanced mode. You don't have to do advanced). A little hard to understand at first but there are plenty of videos on how to ""program"" you vehicle.

You can build complex or simple machinery for hours. Then you will get a quest, try to improve your craft and when you completed that quest, The game will reward you with research points. Research nodes (unlocked by a certain amount of research points) then give you new parts and you will (try) to improve your craft again and again and again - or build a new one because the old one can't handle the new quest. :D

Things that can happend to me in SP and some in MP:
- Boat ran out of fuel 400 m before you reached the target
- Friend left your boat and got shredded by your (still) spinning propellers
- You cruise with multiple ships to tug home a tanker
- You wrote a microcontroller for you clutch (because you didn't wanted the workshop ones, you want to build your own) and reconfigure the PID controller for 2 hours before it works
- Then you do it again, because propellers have more resistance in water then in air
- You deliver a package
- You check the radiation from the nuclear power plant nearby
- You forgot to set the a constant in the microcontroller and beached yourself
- Suddenly it's two am and you don't want to go to bed yet, because this time your microcontroller could work ...

Multiplayer is pretty fun, it's like garrys mod where the fun stuff happens because of your friends playing the game.

Sidenote for Multiplayer: Physics syncs to all the clients. Sometimes it gets a bit slow (matrix slowmo style) when something happens and the game can't quite calcuate it in one go/frame, but after a few seconds it is all fine and dandy again. Oh and also when somebody is in the researy tree xD.

Updates come weekly afaik.

Wonderfull.

If you have a thing for overly complex multi crew machinery that can do several things at the same time this is one of the most perfect games besides submarine simulators and star citizen.  The game isn't fault free, and you need some supercomputer tier CPU to run this perfectly with huge vehicles, but its just amazing. Although it has no weapons whatsoever and there aren't many things to do with creative vehicles besides doing the same missions over and over again, i still consider Stormworks to set a pretty high standar for this kind of multiplayer vehicle sandbox. The updates are constant and the devs work hard, and it always feels so good to see what each update brings. Honestly this is one of the few times im very glad i bought an early access game since there are almost no games like this that combines sandbox world missions with multi crewed huge vehicles with first person controls, switching seats or being a passanger, and being able to build any vehicle yourself.",1573603695,1573603695,True,1,0,0.522058844566345215,0,True,False,True,76561198021141277,554,85,3717,0,2960,1600443335,,

9,57065032,english,Really good game for an alpha. Updates pretty much every week if not it has a huge workshop that releases stuff all the time. There are a few bugs but those are getting worked out all the time. A few things are. One the lag when near shore or with big ships. This has gotten a ton better over the last few updates but is still a problem. Two the water texture glitching through the ship. Also happens less but still not gone. Three the semi rare crashes. Also have improved but still can strike if you really push the game. Water texture is cartoony but actually plays in the games favor as it can look really good without having to be photo realistic. Story mode can be as hard or easy as you want with tons of missions. Only thing I wish would get some love that really has not is the damage model. While yes if you hit something you damage the ship and the texture changes. It really does not feel realistic due to the lack of bending and holes. If the damage model would be similar to space engineers then I feel like it could be really improved. Instead of just changing the texture the ship could bend and break. It would also allow for a repair or referbish type of game play by adding a dry dock style dock that would allow for the player to fix the underside of a ship. Overall a great game but needs some things before launch.,1573590448,1573590448,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True,76561198138696851,45,6,4301,73,2798,1601747239,,

13,57018387,english,"I used to live in Morgan City, LA and I worked for Cal Dive International as a commercial diver and tender. We performed mostly routine rig maintenance off New Iberia in the Gulf of Mexico. We also placed beacons/sonar on the ocean floor to locate and map out pipelines. I had a chance to pilot the Cal Dive II, a diving/support vessel that had a moon pool in the middle of the deck that divers could descend through to get to the job site. One night, as we were going down the Atchafalaya River, the Captain insisted I take the helm...I think that's what he was saying...not 100% sure. Then, he started jumping around, pointing at the radar screen and was yelling, ""Poo doo! Poo doo!"" Evidently, we had sailed straight through a flock of about a million or so waterborne little rubber duck looking...uh...ducks. I didn't see any casualties in our wake. When I dove, I used a Kirby Morgan Superlite(R) 17 mostly and sometimes a Rat Hat. I also ran the internal, on-ship hyperbaric chamber, complete with BIBS.
 Interesting factoid: I can tell you from experience that a Mag Light Mini will fail at approx 129 ft below the surface. I will also say, ""Whatever you see down there, you better keep your head because it can smell fear.""
I never understood a word my boss, MC Boudreaux, said. He would point at what he was talking about, but his pointing finger had been chopped off. I would look at his finger that wasn't there, as if it may suddenly appear and he's scream at me, ""Wtf you lookin' at, college boy??"" He was cool as hell.
Also...deep sea divers breathe ""air,"" not ""oxygen."" Oxygen, breathed at pressure, will burn your lung tissue over time. Like destroy it. At very deep depths, a diver can breath a mixture of gasses fed through the divers umbilical and controlled topside, that can include helium to prevent nitrogen narcosis.
This game makes me feel like it's just another day going to work in the Gulf of Mexico. I loved everything about that job.*

*Except the drunk coon-asses at the Rathskellar who always thought they could beat me at pool. Pfft!

Well, I guess they were pretty cool.

If you're into writing Lua in-game, buy it. It's like Space Engineers and Scrap Mechanic had a baby. Tbh, Stormworks is actually pretty much what I wanted Scrap Mechanic to be.

Some of the issues I describe below seem to be getting addressed slowly. Its still far from what i want with what feels like far to many sync/lag issues, but I remain hopeful now that some attention has been given to this area of the game. Thanks Devs <3 I hope multiplayer remains an important focus of your future development of the game.

One of the best physics, make and do type games I have ever played. A lot of depth, and options available in the games mechanics that allow you to make so many unique creations. 

My only major gripe with it as of late, is the lack of attention to the multiplayer, that is now barely playable, which is a shame because that is by far my favourite part of the game. Playing, building, and solving missions with friends. The player who is hosting is fine, but it has gotten to the point where any other player is in an absolute lag fest, with rubber banding, freezes, and other really unpleasant issues that spoil the fun. We have decent internet and PC's, single player runs a dream, but any kind of co-op on missions is pretty much impossible at this point.

73,43548721,english,"So this is an update (11/3/19).  Games looks like it's made a lot of progress. Looked forward to jumping in. Stared a new game. Got a mission.... ok.... now what? No game hints, no direction. If you didn't already know to spawn a boat from the workshop you'd just be running around. So I spawn an existing boat (no little tutorial to build anything). Now I look at my missions.... oh... great.... a mission to delivery mining equipment. One problem: the god damned way point is over a half an our (in real time) away!!! I mean... it's fun to simply hold you finger on the forward arrow button for 30 minutes or so but eventually that gets pretty dull. I'm sure if I sunk hours upon ours into the game it would be fun but this is just stupid. And I mean stupid. Have tried to start several new games since it's been a while. Each mission tat pops up requires me to ave advanced in the game and know how to use things like winches and other contraptions. Plus the distance to these locations is always well out of the immediate starting area meaning I will have to take an ungodly amount of time to reach it.

Ok, so the game is fun for a while. Building the ships and doing the missions gives you some purpose in building. However, the game just feels empty. There's this massive ocean with nothing in it. No other traffic, not even a bird in the sky. There is the occasional fish, but they're kind of generic and pointless. Not that I don't appreciate them, it's nice to have a little something to make the world feel alive. I know it's early access and only been out for a while but the developers don't seem very forthcoming on what exactly they intend with the game. There is no death in the game. Boats cannot be destroyed. You can land your helicopter in water or run it into a wall with no ill effects. So while it's cool when you build your first ship and then unlock the helicopter it kinda gets meh after that. There's no danger in the game. No fuel. No anchors (ships drift away). The game has serious potential but right now I can't recommend it.",1531671648,1572800280,False,27,9,0.512063026428222656,0,True,False,True,76561197967971182,358,19,1054,0,394,1584899098,,

28,56059368,english,"Now that the performance part of this game has been fixed its so much better. Couple of things. Stormworks is an amazing game, the art-style is really awesome as well as the creations are so cool. I am going to break this game down by category IE Boats, cars, helicopters, planes and misc.

Boats-- So boats is kind of what started this game off. The water physics is actually really good and sometimes is too good and leads to you say ""WHY THE F*** IS THIS BOAT NOT FLOATING"" until you realize 1 block is missing. The fluid physics is really good and when it comes to making fire equipment it really shines, oh yeah did I mention there is vehicle damage. You can 100% blow you creation up because you forgot to connect the radiator, and then you can start a forest fire and have to put it out. The only thing that lack in the boat department is better wakes and bow waves, there are underwater places to explore and if your good enough you can build a submarine.

Planes/Helicopters.---- The aircraft in this game have recently started to get really complicated with the addition of cameras screens and LUA scripting. The creations being made by people like Boeing 777 aircraft with Glass Cockpit designs or people making Coast-Guard Helicopters to recuse AI on missions is amazing. The flight physics are somewhat lacking. As you can build a jet aircraft that take off with 0ft of runway and than somehow shake violently because your going to fast and the GYRO does not really like it. Auto-pilot systems are amazing and useful when your playing alone, or if your with friends. Yes there is Multi-Player and they are improving it alot.

Ground/Misc/Trains.---- The Ground vehicles are amazing, I have spent more time trying to build land speed record cars and weird bus's and tracked things that I sometimes forget how to build boats. The addition of radar/Sonar to the game has added alot for people to work with. Lets say you want to drive an old school car, well all you have to do is hope on the workshop with thousands of creations and well subscribe to one and next thing you know your driving it around a map. Now microcontrolers can be your friend or enemy. I suck at making Micro-Controllers, all they do is basically they act as a mini computer, they allow you to use logic functions to make things work well. If your not good at making your own go browse the workshop for what you need. Oh and Lastly the missions are really fun, sometimes can be really frustrating and annoying but really fun. 

Advanced mode/ Game modes.----- So this game features a really awesome creative/survival game mode. As well as an amazing advanced vehicle mode. With advanced vehicle you have to connect everything from air to coolant to a radiator as well as connecting the drive-lines to the tires.

In conclusion if you want a really good building survival, mission technical and mechanical game to mess around with seriously pick this game up!",1572553408,1572553408,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True,76561198137417075,89,3,32017,446,19961,1602033786,,

Hampered by a mutliplayer that doesn't work properly.

If the multiplayer actually worked properly I'd top rate it. But as it stands the netcode does not work well at all when connected to two or more other folks, expect constant slowdowns due to physics engine (not related to lag or framerate issues) wigging out when someone tries to use a gas connector or picks up a crate or other physical item, strange desync issues (times on completing missions not always synced among players), and simply laggy response times on controls which can be mood killing with vehicles that require responsive controls such as helicopters or when trying to align to a dock without smashing into a cliff. 

Single player works perfectly fine. No issues to report there. If you want to yoink this game to play alone go for it, but you'll have to watch online tutorials on how to do stuff as nothing is explained in game. But this game would have so much potential as a co-op hit if the netcode was a bit better. 

Another serious issue is it being limited by being 32 bit instead of 64. With the friend I was trying to play it with it hammered his first core hard on his CPU while leaving the other ones fine. Why the devs are insisting that is the route forward I have no idea but that also hampers playability.

If The Sims is akin to Playmobile, Minecraft akin to Lego, KSP akin to rc model planes/rocket then Stormworks would be akin to Lego Technic. 

Another similair comparison could be made with Space Engineers, but that game is focused on space and got different building methodes

It allows for building vehicles block by block, with several layers of complexity, even certain areas can be used for structures to customize your own base.

The boat building is impressively complex, with an outstanding amount of freedom and customization. However, there is nothing in the game to explain how the boat reacts to the physics of the game. 

For Example: Make sure the bottom of the boat is fully closed (umm duh right) well not exactly, the engine and exost pieps need special pipe blocks to ensure water does not enter the bottom of the boat. If you boat is too heavy it will sink, you need to set the electric up in certain ways, or you will kill the battery and be lost to see.

29,55739709,english,"Stormworks Build and Rescue is onto something. But the game is missing a fully realized multiplayer + survival world. Currently the map is gigantic taking hours to explore even at high vehicle speeds. The game also tends to lag and crash in multiplayer. Most vehicles have at least 2-4 seats and some have dozens of places where people can sit or even assist in piloting or doing other tasks. Nearly all of the vehicles I've subscribed to have been made with multiplayer in mind. But the game doesn't seem stable enough to support it.

Even playing with people at home hardwired to the same network we were crashing at least every 5 minutes. As a game developer myself I am guessing part of this has to do with the enormous world size. I wonder if a smaller world size would cause less issues in multiplayer?

Another thing I'd suggest is a Multiplayer Survival Mode WITHOUT the ability to spawn in vehicles. Instead, vehicles can be found on the map in various states of disrepair. You find the components to fix them (start with a simple collectible component called 'vehicle parts' that works for all vehicles) and then you can accept rescue missions.

Rescue missions would then become a way of introducing new vehicles that could be repaired and claimed by the player. Claimed vehicles can be locked by setting a code near their start key. This code can be used to unlock the vehicle by teammates. 

In addition to these mechanics I'd also suggest a way to hunt animals (a bow for example) and a way to gather, cook, and eat them. 

Having a hunger and thirst system would add to the drama in the game. If you're going on a long sea voyage you would pack storage compartments with food and actually be able to cook inside some vehicles with kitchens.

This, along with the ability for other players to damage your player with weapons intended for hunting will add a whole new dynamic to the game. 

In addition I would make it possible to ""take over"" found buildings and ports. You would place a lock on the door, set a code and then it would be yours. Then only you  and your team could open and close the doors.

Other players would have to seek out buildings in other areas of the map to call home.

This would be a lot to add, but it would be a controlled environment where the map size and number of complex vehicles could be kept to a minimum. By losing some of the complexity of the full creative mode the game could be optimized better. 

Having a mode like this could grow the games popularity and would also require some official and community server support. It would be a big move but I think Stormworks is worth it.

Do I recommend this game? With hesitation. As a tech guy and game dev I think the game is really interesting. However it won't appeal to the masses yet...",1571890123,1571890123,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True,76561197971295397,117,19,4014,0,3769,1584255032,,

Please developers, don't ever give up on this game, it has a very very promising future, and it delivers a great deal of education on top of everything else. Thank you.

Things that could be improved:
* More window options (angles, sizes)
* Fluid workings/ items need to be ether segregated completely or treated the same way (I can not use a valve to cut off 
   power supply, and I can not use one way valves on power pipes causing a combined system to unevenly spit power, 
   meaning the only way to distribute equal power is through clutch on every  separate outlet pipe)
* windows take up space in in inconvenient ways. 
* doors should still lock without having a complete frame (AKA custom sliding doors are hard to seal)
* Eliminate invisible blocks, people are creating things that they should not physically be able to, make it to where any 
   floating blocks are not merged to anything, thus eliminating impossible structures outside of the intended boundaries.
* Make the cut/ paste process easier (where you can select blocks and slide them over and automatically create a new 
   section, like an actual cut and paste, the current cut/ paste process is way too complicated and time consuming)
* Make connectors that can be spawned connected ( I was trying to make a detachable weight that would sit in my boat 
   until I needed it for my water crane and could not figure out a way to do it)
* Make crane hose/ cable a real object so that when we pull the cable back up the node does not get stuck under the boat. 
   (Or at least create a crane wheel attachment we can merge the cable to so the wheel can guide the cable to keep it from 
   getting stuck under the structure of origin)

* Make more use of hotkeys in creation mode, they are super handy and keep players interested. A lot of time is wasted 
   trying to figure out how to do everything with a mouse.

I will say the flying and boating is pretty good, the land based vehicles are terrible however. The system for controlling engines in this game is atrocious as well. They give you a clutch that just stalls everything so you cannot build anything unless you can code using the microcontrollers which I'm sure 75% of people don't know how to use.

Pros: Very versatile building tools

Cons: Not much to do
          No tutorials for how to build (you must rely on reverse engineering, and the in game builds aren't complex enough to learn anything useful from

          The internet is basically required to learn how to do anything (Sometimes its easy to find what you're looking for, and sometimes there are no good tutorials out there for what you're looking for)
          Engine power levels are all over the place, some are too powerful and need to be limited, and some are too weak.

Initially I will admit I was sceptical about this game and even the first time I played I was still unsure.

But then I started to explore the sheer depth of the game. The logic, the physics, the building, the freedom! It is a pleasure to play this. I do quite like the cartoonish graphics and this also means the performance is flawless (except the odd frame stutter) even on my low end PC. 

Missions are varied, interesting and immersive. The first storm I encountered and the first flash of lightening I jumped out of my skin! The physics is very well modelled and causes you to focus on a developmental process of design - your vehicles although complete will be modified, adjusted and improved upon through several iterations as you learn how your design will be affected by the forces of nature.

It is rare to find a game that delivers good performance, exceptional immersion, fantastic physics simulation, a detailed, varied and unique open world all while allowing you to build your own vehicles.

I just recently was able to buy a copy of the game (I've been watching a lot of YouTube videos on it for the past year and wanted to get it) and I finally did! It is even more amazing than I expected it to be!

However there is one slight optimization issue.
Now I am fully aware (because I've researched the issue) that I'm not the only one to experience it. I also know the issue is not on my end. A lot of people experience it differently.  How the issue looks for me is that whenever I spawn in a bigger vechicle (or a vechicle with a really high amount of advanced components) I experience lag. Now I know that this isn't the usual lag you get, because when I press F1 the FPS count is usually in between 30 - 40 FPS. The character moves really slowly (it looks like slow motion) and the waves also usually move very slowly. I have done various things to prevent this, I went into career mode (I thought the issue was something to do with islands and the creative options), I even disabled Advanced Vechicles, and while it did help, I'd rather play with Advanced Vechicles on. I also turned every possible performence setting down to the lowest option.

Yes, it's early access and it has a few problems here and there with submerged buoyancy physics (some strange behaviour at times) and the multiplayer side of it is very hit and miss and doesn't work more than it works. But I have spent so many hours making just 2 vessels and making them progressively more and more complex with various features and enjoyed every single minute doing so.

=========================

Update to review: 

I feel I can no longer recommend the game anymore.
It is no longer the game that it started off as - it seems to now attract a much younger player base and as a result they have their own wants / needs from the game and are voting for stupid and pointless things on Discord which then get added to the game.

Things such Giant Sharks, Trains (is a sea rescue game?), Oil buying and selling (? - ok, I suppose I can build oil tankers instead of rescue craft ?), solid rocket boosters - all the while there are long term problems with core physics (water doesn't even behave like water anymore) and the way that objects interact (the game engine doesn't allow most types of boat builds that work in real life, for example a simple ""row boat"" would sink in this game).

Some of this was acceptable when the game was in its infancy, but now it is just plainly being ignored and brushed under the carpet, which is NOT OK.

Just one example of strange physics behaviour that seems to be accepted: I have built a large ship with a small custom door on the outside of the hull. When I open this, the physics sometimes decide that it will make my large heavy ship do a roll into the water because the door gets stuck on ""nothing"". I believe the devs often refer to this as phantom robotic behaviour or something similar when the problem gets raised, with no mention of them fixing it - it just seems like an accepted feature of the game whereby you can have something that weighs mere KG's that can then force something that weighs hundreds of tons to rotate around it and with no obvious way to repeat it or stop it from happening as it seems to be random.",1527761521,1569418915,False,0,0,0.480489253997802734,1,True,False,True,76561197990061442,59,8,43171,74,4770,1601556548,,

Picking things up and moving them with your character can be annoying. The AI isn't very intelligent and half the time on rescue missions you'll have to move them around manually by picking them up. 

I can go on with some of the negatives in the game, but why would I? It's an early access game and the devs are working hard to keep adding features. It's not a finished game and nobody is saying it is. That being said, for what you get it's damn entertaining. 

Building your own vehicle (and that can be a tiny boat to the literal RMS Titanic) is a blast. It's unique, thoroughly entertaining, and will keep you coming back with every update.

Hours and hours of building in the vehicle editor and maybe a few minutes actually playing the game itself. But those few minutes were worth it. Seeing your creation come to life and seeing that it works as intended really fills you with a sense of satisfaction. And I rarely get that with any games. 
If you aren't a real creative tinkerer type then this game still has a lot in store for you to do. The workshop is FULL of awesome craft for you to use on the many multiple stock and user created missions available. 

This game doesn't need a beefy PC to run. With more recent updates the game runs smoothly. I haven't had any issues with it crashing or being a pain and i'm running on Linux using Proton. The platform that's supposed to be the most unstable.

The laws of physics are obeyed in this game so driving anything is affected by the wind, waves, and flooded compartments. There are currently 2 main game modes; career and creative, with the option to customize either mode for difficulty. In career mode, you complete missions for money, bonus parts, and research points to unlock more parts. In creative mode, you do whatever you want with no restrictions. You can also adjust the weather and spawn tsunamis and megalodons (yes, they exist in this game). This is a peaceful game, there are no weapons and I doubt the developer plans to put any in.

seeing your boat take tsunamis and the highest waves, your missile hitting it's mark, your plane making it to the Artic and your submarine surfacing after a long and harrowing underwater exploration.

There's a full array of fun missions, progress based unlocking of parts and if you prefer it, a creative mode where you can freely build anything (and I do mean anything) your heart desires, simply check out the workshop and you'll see what I mean. One of the key features of this game is the advanced logic, you can even build your own microcontrollers, these little microchips can be made to do anything, from flashing some lights to making a hundred foot high robot walk around. If you prefer the easier life, there is also a simple mode for both creative and the progressional missions but I highly recommend getting used to advanced mode as quickly as you can as it will make your experience far more fun.

You have to be super dedicated to the game to understand some of these things.

No mtxs, no grind, no bs. 

Obviously in an early access state while there continue to be bugs the game develops at a rate you can see with updates every Friday. 

In terms of building, this game really caters to those of all skill levels ranging from simplistic modes where you don't need to worry about pipes, fuel supplies and a lot of small details to a full fledged advanced mode capable of have creations with self programmed pids, huds and touchscreens. 

Fear not though folks who prefer to just plug and play, with an active workshop with thousands of well made creations the option to just mix and match from the creations generously uploaded is one that many choose. 


For the tinkerers like myself this allows me to mess around with lua control systems and routines and everything you could possibly want all without having to download or faff around with a single mod.

38,52227740,english,"This game used to be excellent until a recent event that has completely changed the game's fate from possibly being another Kerbal Space Program but with boats, to another abandoned voxel game.

People started discovering how to exploit the game's poorly simulated physics to create infinite energy by wiring a diesel engine to crap tons of small generators. This prompted the developers to create a major balance update that completely ruined all forms of electricity in the game other than pre-charged batteries (which were impossible to charge again). Everything was nerfed to be hilariously inefficient and every single vehicle on the workshop no longer worked at all. Fortunately, they pushed out an update about a week or two later (I'm not sure, the important part is that it came out and it didn't take months and it fixed things) and now electric generators created a reasonable amount of electricity again while still fixing the exploit.

This would be all well and good if it weren't for the fact that the developers are once again completely rebalancing the game's energy physics. They just pushed out an update that completely changes the way engines work; all vehicles that directly wired engine power (i.e. not into a bunch of generators and then using electric motors to power wheels, which considering the last update, these were all considered broken, and still don't work nearly as well as they used to) no longer work barely at all. My speedboat's top speed has been cut into a QUARTER of before and has even worse fuel consumption. Not to mention that the electric nerf update cut the speed even of fully diesel vehicles in half already, so now everything is just outright stupidly slow with outright stupid fuel consumption.

The best part is, they didn't tell us how to make a functioning vehicle at all. They just showed a bunch of engines running not connected to anything that provides resistance. So now we're once again left in the dark as the entire workshop is full of nonfunctional obsolete vehicles and no idea how to properly use the engine, but this is a lot worse than the electric update because now NOTHING works.

The point I'm making here is that the developers are making gameplay changes that are so major that the way you design vehicles in the game [strike]other than basic piping[/strike] has to change entirely... [b]EVERY TWO WEEKS.[/b]

Of course, the fanboys are going to play the ""Muh Early Access"" card, but after the last few years of using steam, most people are sick of this kind of thing and are just going to move on to something else. If you're one of them, I'm your cue.

There's also this ret@rded giant shark that eats your entire ship to pieces and they don't want to add guns. But solid rocket boosters are A-OK, as long as they distract everyone from how broken this game is.

1. AMD users always suffer and the devs always have to fix AMD users from crashing a lot, most updates are fine, but now and then the Devs overlook AMD users and keep the game crashing for AMD users for a week - 2 weeks before they fix it, so if you got a AMD GFX Card you best save the game and what you'er working on every 4 mins.

2. They are still adding stuff in so maybe this may finally get added hopeful, but right now from the time of writing still no colour pick wheel you'er stuck to what your given and it lets down the building bit of the game as you want another color, but nope your stuck to what you get.

3. Might be a little picky with this one, When you start the campaign mode of the game its a bit boring grind to get enough money to finally see the rest of the map you be going backwards and forwards doing the tutorial mission over and over again and gets really boring, after all you get at the start is a small propeller that hardly goes fast once you got enough researched done and money then the campaign becomes a bit more fun to play with.

4. There should be a tutorial on how to build an engine in the game i was so lost and as i removed the starter boat save i was stuck, I had to watch a youtube video that didn't fully explain it well, but i worked it out based on that video on my own that took me a long time to learn my 27 hours playtime is more of 24 hours as yes it took me about 3 hours of my day to finally learn how to make an engine as no good youtube video shows how and the game doesn't either.

5. There are lightning bugs in the game that still hasn't been fixed from when i bought it. Try not to ever use the flashlight as that's when the lighting doesn't know what to do to and gets all pixelated and just looks really bad to look at, but as the game gets really dark some times i have to use the flashlight. :( 

6. Its 32bit there is no 64bit verson.

so that's why I didn't recommend the game, but deep down i do recommend it, but with all what i listed i feel like it can't give a good thumbs up with all the them things, am kinda mixed feelings if they was a mix instead of a yes or no recommended button on steam i would press the mixed button as its a good game but these downsides drag it down from being a great game for me.",1566077540,1566077540,False,1,0,0.47826087474822998,0,True,False,True,76561198075438847,66,10,1621,0,1621,1566073328,,

Tips for new players:

You will be forced to play your first game in 'normal mode' which is a stripped down version of the full depth this game offers, but it's not as bad as it sounds. The simplified easy mode is actually pretty comprehensive and you'll have a lot to sink your teeth into before ever jumping into proper 'survival mode' (with advanced vehicle mechanics).

Tips for building:

- Know these shortcuts:
  - TAB - opens/closes your inventory
  - X - toggles the eraser mode
  - CTRL+Click - selects the block type under your mouse cursor so you don't have to search for it in your inventory
- You can click & drag pyramid blocks to create angled shapes quickly.
- You will probably want to use X-axis symmetry most of the time.
- Building vehicles can be slightly tedious due to having to rotate & flip blocks in so many different directions all the time. Use symmetry to reduce that work.
- Change the build camera from orbit mode to free mode if you aren't used to 3D editing environments. This will allow you to move around more easily using the movement keys (WASD) and Q/E for down/up.

General tips:

- Design your boats with plenty of interior hull space so that they'll be able to float on water.
- Don't make your boats too top-heavy or you'll have stability problems. Adding weight at the bottom of your boat is an effective way to balance out the mass above the water line. But this means your boat will be overall even heavier, so you'll need more free space inside your hull  to increase buoyancy.
- If you want a way to get below the deck of your ships you'll need to use the door or hatch components. This is the only way that the physics simulation will know that this area is sealed (when the doors or hatches are closed at least). Be sure to place these well above the waterline on your deck, otherwise they'll get flooded and your ship will sink even though realistically it would be fine. This is an unfortunate but necessary side-effect to make the simulation possible in real-time, but it should become less of an issue the bigger ships you build.
- When you're doing a mission and you have to travel a few kilometres by boat, and your boat isn't that fast, it can be a little boring if you have to stay at the helm to push the throttle and make course corrections. To mitigate this you can set a throttle and rudder trim by holding the left ALT key. Then you can get out of your seat, walk around and inspect your ship, and check the map/mission/tech screen. However, don't try to be too badass and get out of your poorly designed submarine at cruise speed because you might fall off and have to start over.
- When you get into bigger ships and harder missions, and you have researched the necessary technologies, you can build advanced systems to control and automate your ships and other machines. Heading hold, GPS waypoints and roll stabilisation are good things to add to your ships.
- You may want to build robotic arms to manipulate mission objects (cargo). Be sure to build them robust enough for the intended purpose. If your robotic arm is too heavy and big for your ship and/or the cargo, you won't have a good time. Make a more humble arm and/or a bigger ship.
- The 'medium ship hull' preset is a good size starting point for a nice, sturdy towing ship. Just add your own helm, some railings, a winch and enough engine power. If you want to go bigger you have to create your own hull, and I suggest breaking up the basic shape a bit more, so that it doesn't look too flat.",1563878890,1564322637,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True,76561198032735794,45,9,74008,2559,883,1601897575,,

This is one of the best ""games"" I have ever played. I say ""game"" because it's really an engineering simulator. Stormworks lets you engineer what you want, how you want, and take it for a spin in a huge open world. Well done, devs. Great concept, great execution, great work.

LENGTHIER REVIEW
Stormworks is an engineering simulator but with game elements (missions, objectives) in a large open world. If you just want to make a contraption, you can jump into Creative mode where all components are available. You can produce whatever kind of contraption that takes your fancy: air vehicles, sea vehicles, land vehicles, trains (yes, there's a rail network!) and stationary contraptions.

The contraption editor is multi-layered, which means there's different views for different things, i.e. views for component placement, electrical links, and logic. Whilst some logic blocks are available in the editor for placement directly onto the contraption, you can use microcontrollers for projects that require more complex logic. Microcontrollers have their own editor, in which you can place logical operations and functions into a microcontroller and specify inputs and outputs.

Stormworks is not easy to get to grips with due to its complexity (and there are a few issues at the moment, like with the way buoyancy is calculated) and I've had many hours of frustration, but once you get used to it, it's incredible what it allows you to do. You'll be spending quite some time learning the ropes before producing anything decent. Also, quality contraptions take some time to produce.

Things I've made as of typing: a heavy lifter with crane, two jet planes, a tri-prop plane just because I can, two helicopters, jet boat, and recently, two sizes of load-adjusting electrical generators (i.e. engine throttle adjusts depending on the electrical load)

Me and a friend pulled off some sick helo rescues, with rescue divers and winch operations. I felt like an actual coastie

Me and a friend put out some fires on ships and lighthouses 

Me and a friend did some cargo and tanker operations

Me and a friend broke our save beyond repair because we crashed so many ships together and sank them all

For someone who enjoys maritime sandbox games, complex ship systems, and coast guard stuffs, this is the game for you. There are endless possibilities about what you can do in relation to sailing/captaining/crewing a multitude of vessels (Merchant, Coast Guard, Military, Civillian).

[h1] Pros: [/h1]
+ Amazing ship building system

+ Extremely complex logic systems for winches, engine starts, circuit breakers, fuel pipes, etc (easy to get a grip on. Its the possibilities for complexity that's the best)

+ Fantastic physics and game engine

+ Logic systems are up to par for people who aren't computer wizards

+ There are hundreds of ships for download if you don't want to build a ship

+ There are hundreds of extra missions available to download to expand upon your gameplay and playstyle 

[h1] Cons: [/h1]
- Multiplayer runs your server (through steam friends) at the lowest person's framerate. Say your friend is getting 10fps and you're getting 200fps, everyone connected plays at 10fps since it runs the lowest person's performance

- Hoses and fuel can be buggy (With limited fuel activated)

- Advanced/Basic ship system. Some ships are built with ""Advanced Vehicles"" disabled which means there are incompatabilities if you are running with advanced options enabled/disabled

- Water physics can break stuff on your boat, like cargo boxes, NPC's and other attached items

- Vanilla missions get repetitive",1564018790,1564018907,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True,76561198066885166,140,4,1133,29,843,1601339754,,

Ignore the hate regarding optimization, those complaining about not being able to run the game likely can't run 60% of what's on Steam to begin with....it was already time for an update in that case.

That being said, I have noticed issues with grabbing things like the fuel hose and hoists. I'll get bounced all over the place, but the host can use them with no problem.

EDIT: Multiplayer needs a loooot of improvement. Lag is ridiculous even with two high end pcs and fiber connection.

It's pretty awesome. The graphics are kind of subjective. You either like the style or don't. Personally, I think they're pretty okay, and serve the game well enough. At times, they're even downright beautiful. Either way, the big thing here is gameplay, and it's good. Really good. I just have to say this though... DO THE TUTORIAL. Building ships and vehicles and upgrading them on the workbench is so awesome once you get the hang of it, but without doing the tutorial for a basic understanding, or looking up some guides, it's super easy to get frustrated (or maybe that's just me, because I'm a big dummy). My second recommendation is to avoid the Workshop content for a while. A lot of it is broken, and I also feel like if you're not using your own creativity and problem solving ability, you're missing out on a large part of what this game is. Now then... onto to the other part: The actual missions. So far what I've seen are all really diverse, or at least randomized enough that things stay interesting. The dynamic weather and ocean are formidable opponents. Taking my slightly modified tutorial speedboat out on her maiden voyage to deliver some parts to the nuclear plant, got real interesting real quick when a storm brewed up and the seas got rough. I'm honestly surprised I didn't capsize, though I did have to go swimming after my cargo a few times. I felt an honest sense of relief when I got them delivered. USPS ain't got **** on ME!!! Seriously though, this game is something special and I can't wait to see what else the devs do with it.",1561950770,1563295225,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True,76561198079823508,222,61,1985,0,429,1579056210,,

Stormworks...



Where to start honestly.



Alright then the music.


The music is really cool and intense, the music also start when you do something such as entering workbench or starting a mission.



Price.





Yes as I last recall coastguard carnival simulator admission prices are $25 which is quite reasonable.







Community.





Eh..




naggy



But that's not anyone's fault thats just happened because youtubers play the game and a whole lot of 6 yr olds start playing and know nothing.






Quality.




Graphics are simple, HOWEVER they are so because of the high pc requirements for the water physics etc.




UIs (User Interfaces / Menus) Very well done the UIs are easy to understand and looker very clean and polished, starting from scratch is easy as many buttons have clear descriptions, the workbench UI is well managed and neat, however a few items lack descriptions which needs to be changed however the game is in early access so small things slip through.




Game fun.


This game is very fun and by my nearly 500 hrs you can tell, the game is realistic making it very hard but also extremely satisfying when something goes right.




PC power requirements.



Ahhh here we are...


The game recomends a minimum i5 6th gen with 4gbs of ram.

Disclaimer, if you don't mind low-ish graphics and the in-ability to spawn some large ships or massive creations or maybe many many small creations without lag then sorry.

Minimum I have seen the game run is on a i3 8th gen 8gbs ram, but with 0fps.

I currently use a i7 quad core with 32 gb ram and I am fine.

I also use on my laptop a i7 quad core with 16gb ram.

Any i5 6th gen + should be fine.

Anything below = CERTAIN 0FPS.


And no of course a chrome book can't run Stormworks.


But what if you have a Mac?


Some macbooks can run Stormworks well.

Most struggle for FPS.


The Mac desktops are OK but not great at running the game.


Overall.


For good FPS to vehicle count / size ration use a custom built PC with minimum i7 core or above.



Multiplayer.




Multiplayer us being developed and currently has a lot of issues.


A player count above 3 players is a bad idea.


optimal player count is 2.


Multiplayer has a few bugs in terms of teleporting and stuffs.


Multiplayer framerate is dependent on the two PCs and internet connection.


Fast internet connections isn't the only factor or the main factor.


PC speed is.




Difficulty.


Hard.

Well let me rephrase that.


Hard to be good.


Thats better.


Good creations are hard, bad ones are easy.





Gameplay.


Career is challenging and time constrained.

Creative is fun and exciting but can be frustrating.

Hardcore is downright hard af.




Update speeds.


The game gets a minor update weekly every Saturday depending on where you live.

A major update is released every couple months or sooner.





Devs.



The developers are always responding to questions and are quite kind.







The developers listen to ideas btw.




Overall worth.



9.5 / 10 


Why 9.5?


because the game isn't perfect.

45,50281884,english,"Stormworks is basically a building game in which you make vehicles to perform (mostly) coastguard type missions. The missions you complete can be anything from delivering critical supplies to rescuing submariners and putting out big fires. The vehicles you can build range from simple boats to massive ships, helicopters, airplanes and even (oddly enough) trains and now rockets.

As well as playing in the sandox ""creative mode"" you can play a career mode in which you accumulte research points for different parts (like Kerbal Space Program) and money for the different bases. The career mode also offers options such as a survival and permadeath mode. The missions offer a lot of variety and the map is HUGE: To get to the relatively new Arctic area, you can spend upwards of 30 minutes on a reasonably fast train.

The building can be done in either basic or advanced modes. I've only 'dabbled' in basic mode so most of the following refers to that. All building is done with blocks and creations can sometimes look a little 'minecrafty'. There are lots of different kinds of blocks, lots. After building your boat (or other creation), you'll need to give it engines (which need a fuel and air supply, exaust and a connection to a propellor). You'll need to connect the engine and a rudder to a pilot seat to control the boat. Then you'll need to provide every part with electricity. And this is just a basic boat. If it sounds daunting, it's because it is, at least at first. After practice, it does become clear how much thought has gone into the interface and the feeling of satisfaction at having a working boat is great.

I love Stormworks. I love that you can get into your creations and walk around, I love the complexity, I love the variety. In fact, this may be my favourite game of the last five years. But, as you might have guessed, my main gripe at the moment is the accessibility. I want this game to be successful, it deserves to be. While adding tips etc. may be pointless at the moment due to it constantly changing, by 1.0 they HAVE to have decent and wide ranging in game tutorials - rather than relying on the (admitedly superb) tutorials available on youtube by fans of the game.",1556024105,1563217249,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True,76561197975821970,212,26,18591,0,13235,1600806513,,

86,53788092,english,"Stormworks: Build and Rescue is a game where you can build your own ships, helicopters, planes, and even land vehicles - and then play missions with them. As the game title suggests the focus is on rescue and emergency service vehicles. 

There are two modes in the game for building: 
The first one is the normal mode. This mode is very helpful for new players and makes it easy to build functioning vehicles and to learn how to build vehicles that dont look like a painted box with an rotor on top. ;)

The second mode is the advanced mode. In this mode you can build more advanced creations with for example own jet engines and stuff. If you are new to the game i would recommend you to bring some patience, because you will need a few trys to make your creations work.

I strongly recommend watching some youtube videos in order to learn how the advanced building system works.
As an alternative  you can download other players workshop creations and see how they are built, or directly play with them.

When it comes to mission playing there are multiple missions given by the game. The workshop offers even more missions.

I really enjoyed every minute of playing Stormworks. For me the game was totally worth the price.

- modes for beginners and advanced players


Con:
- There aren't nearly enough types of blocks!
- Physics simulation does not always reflect reality. (Thus instead of using what one learnt in school, one needs to re-discover stuff, including the math that comes with it)

The player can decide which level of realism he wants to use to build his vehicles which makes it easier for beginners to get into the game.

The developers react to the community, its not that the community 100% influences the road map but there still is an influence.

You build vehicles such as ships, locomotives, cars, trucks, airplanes, jets and helicopters. 

In Advanced Mode, you also build the working parts of those vehicles such engines, cooling, drivetrain, electrics, piping, transmission, ECU, computers, radars, sonars, etc.

The best part is that you have missions to test the things you built and then you can easily share them on the Steam Workshop.

Go crazy make a boat that holds a boat that hold another boat. Also the game has logic gates that are very easy to use and understand so its a decent place to get some circuits/logic experience.

Edit: I happen to notice a lot of comments talking about the batteries and electric power. I cant speak for how it was before but I create advanced boats with the current build of the game based only on the tutorial and my knowledge of how smaller boats, like watersport and small offshore fishing boats, work and my batteries work fine they dont drain, I cant speak for making an electric only ship cuz I havent unlocked the last tier electric equipment but a normal ship works exactly how an experienced boater would expect, and yes a brand new starter battery will drain very very rapidly trying to start an engine that refuses to do so.

It looks really nice and doesnt look bad at all on lowest graphic settings. Its a huge amount of fun to build Creations that are doing their job, except there are bugs like a room flooding that is sealed D: , but it feels great to have done the mission with your own built craft.
Multiplayer: The devs said they arent really gonna worry about that, its a lot of fun with your friend playing but it lacks on things like delays and all that stuff, therefore its really unstable.

42,51187973,english,"Good game, worth the current $20 price. Graphics aren't amazing, but the actual core gameplay is awesome right now. I've played for 25 hours at the time of posting this and I am thoroughly hooked. If you enjoy building games like Kerbal Space Program and Factorio, you'll probably love this. It has a similar feel to KSP around version 0.19 - the core mechanics are there, the game is already fun, but there's still plenty of room for polishing and improvement.

A few interesting things of note in no particular order:

[list]
[*] When the weather gets windy, the waves can really pick up and you may find yourself going up and down hills of water on a speedboat trying to reach an injured fisherman to get them to a hospital.

[*] It looks like the devs are doing weekly updates.

[*] Advanced mode is for people who love to get into the nitty-gritty. Pipes are used to connect power and fluids, so hooking up a basic diesel engine would involve coolant in, coolant out, fuel in, air in, exhaust out, and power out. You'd then probably want a gearbox and clutch before you connect it to your propeller or rotor. Builds can get beautifully complicated rather quickly in advanced mode.

[*] Have you ever played a game with robotic parts and wished you could hook them up to sensors to get them to automatically activate? This game has that. You can also build your own microcontrollers for them using logic gates, latches, etc. or even using Lua scripts.

Of particular highlight are the vehicle systems, starting with a truly superb editor that makes it easy to transition from designing small vehicles, right the way up to huge tankers and aircraft - but beyond that, its the integration of the systems in advanced mode that make it so satisfying, designing your own logic and control systems, firing data down composite networks, and feeding video up from hard-to-see places - its an absolutely joy to play, and a beautiful place to be.

63,51089488,english,"I love this game! When I first bought it, I found that it had graphics, and physics like none other. Just the way that the water filled rooms on ships, and the way that aircraft flew... it was amazing! At first, I didn't think I could make anything, but after they added the advanced vehicles, I decided that I should give it a shot. I threw myself into the deep end, and I've made several successful vehicles on the workshop. These vehicles include helicopters, cars, and airplanes. After just a few days of experimenting, it all started to make sense.

Even if you can't understand the way that things are built, you can simply go to the workshop and download things. With the constant development and updates, new programming and automation can be incorporated into creations. The creations are becoming more and more advanced, and there are so many that it's impossible not to find one that doesn't fit your needs! It's a great game, with a great community behind it!

As for some of the negative reviews, most of the people posting them have very few hours on record. One complained about it being hard to make things. I assume that they didn't know about the workshop. not to mention the fact that creations do NOT have to be complex and super over-engineered. My most successful creation is one of my simplest. It has well over 1,000 downloads at the time that I am writing this. Trust me, with a little time put into experimenting and testing, anything is possible. Also, the developers are by far the best developers I've ever seen! It's not often that you see a development team that actually listens to what the players want in the game!

I love this game, you may not, but I ask that you give it a try. Thank you for your time.   :)",1559867214,1559867214,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True,76561198205873413,18,4,31911,0,28251,1597961432,,

The good:

- Building stuff is simple

- With some creativity, you can build practically anything

- One of the few games whose waves are actually an obstacle

- Simple yet charming graphics

- Weekly updates

- Devs actually listen

- Few bugs and few glitches

- Steam Workshop support

- Decent amount of customization (not great, but better than some games)


The bad:

- Large ships WILL lag your game, no matter how good your computer is

- Steep learning curve

- Can get a little boring after a while

- Needs more danger and thrill (but not the scary kind of thrill. We already have over-aggressive sharks)

- Occasional crashes

Various logic blocks, along with ways to create advanced logic systems (memory r/w, switch boxes, PID controllers) exist. There is even a Lua code box within microcontrollers which allows you to make basic Lua scripts. These can draw on top of video feeds, allowing you to create overlays other things.

Best of all, the game has basic fluid simulation, which prevents sealed compartments from filling, and damaged or open comparments from slowly filling with water. The game also has basic pressure simulation for air and water.

There is a simple mission based campaign mode (Like Kerbal Space Program), with a tech tree if that's your thing.

Some cons however are a slightly laggy multiplayer, which has some bugs but generally is stable. Vehicles also do not break into pieces on impact, the physical shape of the boat remains the same. However, parts can get damaged which reduces their functionality.

I've been looking for something to get my Engineer Mind into, and with a lot of let downs I was starting to give up. Until, I came across this savour! Not only has it got a good building and logic system to make more or less anything, the gameplay really makes the game shine! 

At this moment, I've only played 50 hours in both Career & Creative but I can say for sure, this is worth the money! I understand it's in Alpha, but really has been worked on by some great Devs! They have been listening to the Community for Suggestion and the Workshop has some great creations from it's community!

Regardless if you've never played an in depth building game before, or you have played these types of games for years. This is one of the best in my library and I am addicted too it! 

Only problems I found is that it can get a bit laggy with some larger builds and doesn't work that well on some certain gaming rigs. You need a computer with a good Processor and GPU to get smooth gameplay. Other than that, its just got the standard bugs you find in any Early Access game.

And the game also supports custom controllers (hotas stick, driving wheel with clutch), which I think is a big plus compare to other vehicle building games. It just makes controlling your plane/car so much easier if you happen to have those controllers for other games.

70,50492116,english,"This game is an interesting mix of lego like vehicle building and rescue sim with interesting weather effects and a nice large sandbox world with plenty to do and see.

The big problem is the game runs really slowly with anything more than a small vehicle in it. I can just about run it with a medium sized rescue boat or helicopter but as soon as you get anything larger the game really starts to slow down and lags badly. Put a container ship into it and it is impossible to play it.

Practically all of the user-made models don't work as they come, even the devs made examples are broken in some way. You usually have to alter them in some way to get them to work properly - sometimes the engines dont start, sometimes the various controls are not connected properly, sometimes you cant even get inside the vehicles. I dont know whether this is deliberate to force you to work on them yourself, but when all you want to do is import and model and try it, it does get a bit frustrating after a while when it happens to nearly every model you get.

Another issue is the rate of increase in difficulty - when you start you begin with something small like a speedboat, but the games missions soon force you to make a plane or a helicopter or a submarine, often requiring a working winch or water cannon system, etc. And that is when the problems start, because making one of those complex vehicles, that will actually work properly, is very difficult compared to making a boat or a car. The missions need to be designed a bit more of a friendly manner for beginners or non-qualified engineers.

Overall the basis of the game is quite fascinating, but if devs cannot figure out how to optimise the game it's not going to be possible to play it. Its a natural thing to soon want to start building very large and complex vehicles. Presently you just cannot do that. So its a great idea but they really need to figure out how to make it practical with today's computing technology.",1557057079,1557057855,False,7,0,0.453307420015335083,6,True,False,True,76561197987174692,132,83,1148,0,1042,1575801711,,

With over 350 hrs on it I have had some ideas or some bugs that relate to the core game, Just to start off this game is amazing and has a great community unlike some other games. With pretty good reviews I believe this game is already at its half potential. Most bugs that bother people are getting out or some seats causes you to go out of the vehicle,also NPC,s are a little bugged too. Sometime’s when you run they stop following for some reason any ways these were the negative. Some of many pro’s are that it is updated refuels and the community doesn’t have to wait for a certain bug to be fixed as new fixes come out weekly. Anyways some ideas are increase Npc awareness and AI so they can sit where they want they follow you automatically or they actually try to swim away from sharks. Also(this is a big one) weaponry! Please add some weapons such as a pistol,at AR or even rpg’s. On planes bomb should work and cause fire and damage and guns should be added like actual rockets that target other vehicles or atleast a 50 cal. If possible. One last thing I think when you ram a ship a piece of the ship should come off and cause visual damage not scratches that let water in. Q/A  Can you find whales?
Can you lift and iceberg? Is a firing mechanism possible?

My favourite type of games are games where you have to use creative skill and logical thinking to make something usefull, and then use it. If you're one of those who gets hooked on games like minecraft, space engineers or general building games, then this is perfect for you. 

The game is still in development, and you will notice that, but the amount of content and quality is still more than enough to make it worth your time. The developers have lots of first hand contact with the community over discord and release new updates every week with either new features like new building components or stuff like additions to the world or campaign gameplay. There's a huge world to discover and you'll be impressed by how detailed the physics is within stuff like airodynamics, fluid pressure, temperature and even underwater pressure. Pumping water out of an airlock while 200 meters under the ocean will no doubt take some time. 

The community is small enough for you to easily come in contact with people on discord and share knowledge as people are always willing to help. Which is good since the learning curve might be a bit steep, but there's some good tutorial lying around to help you get started.

There are so many possibilities on what you can build:
Helicopters, Planes, Boats, Submarines etc..
There are not really many glitches in this game, but sometimes it crashes.
I don´t know if the problem is the game or my Computer, but if it runs it runs great and I can build big boats without any lags.
The building mechanics are great and I like it that you build in an editor and not just on the ground.
I played other building games before and I must say that this is the best of them all.
On my opinion the game price is very low and it is worth way more than 16,79 Euros.
Thanks to the editors for making this great game with this price. I really like it.
If you want to play this game by your own, you have to like these kind of games, but it´s always worth a try.
I wasn´t sure if I should buy this game, but when I did it I was happy I did it.
Thanks again for this great game and keep up the great work.

I love how in-depth the designer is, to make amazingly complex creations, and how much vast ocean, interesting bases, and land areas there are to explore. Not to mention the ability to build complex trains, planes, helicopters, and other vehicles. Absolutely Outstanding. You can also set up your own rescue missions and launch multiple ships at a time.

Pros
-The devs are constantly developing and are listening to the community
-Very active and healthy community
-Endless possibilities. Like having infinity amount of LEGO
-Loads to do
-Good workshop for those who dont want to build or are looking for help

Cons
-After playing for hours, you will have the same missions over and over again. There is a bit lack of missions, but it is being under development. Also missions on the workshop
-Demand a quite powerful processor to have medium to large vessels or complex builds
-Under development, so things change, and it's sometimes a bit annoying having to constantly adapt to things like power increase/decrease, fluid dynamic etc

The premise is simple: Build a vehicle and do some missions, Start on basic, Build a boat, get across the pond and get some money.

Easy right? throw in some waves, weather effects that can blow you out the air or even down into the sea or giant tsunami's that feel the need to impose RIGHT as you have that final survivor literately danging from your helicopter barely able to make it high enough without being blown back into the ocean!

what about a submarine? sure you can build that, Make it nice and air tight maybe throw some seats in there.

Well that's what this game is, Its testing you and your friends to build a stupidly accessible amount of vehicles and to beat the objectives around the world map as you grow your rescue company or just mess about in sandbox! There are alot of details i'm missing out like the need to keep warm or you'll die of hypothermia, you cant be in the ocean too long exposed or you'll get torn to shreds or hell even just building a ship that doesn't sink in the port but all this is something everyone should atleast try once.

It might not be a high octane battle royale or a serious FPS shooter but you will be sweating like a fat man at a buffet when that tsunami decide's to smack your little speed boat into the nearest rock because life's just unfair :^)

and if that doesn't interested you just check out the workshop for some serious fun toys~

There is a steep learning curve with the advanced ships feature, but after getting used to it, it is the only way I play. Very fun game! There are a couple minor flaws, as others have said since it is Peer to Peer servers, if one person in the session is laggy (internet lag, or even alt-tabbing), everyone else gets it. Also, since I mainly play on multiplayer, i've gotten to have a love hate relationship with grabbable objects, such as fuel hoses, or handles.

29,49323866,english,"Hello Stormworkers!

Thanks for reading my review.

This is one of the best SANDBOX GAMES ive ever seen (Beside Brick Rigs)

Everything has been made so nice, the physics looks pretty realistic, the builds from the Stormworks Community is amazing, and it even has Multiplayer (but sadly no Servers)

Multiplayer is ok, atleast we can play with 6 Players (incl. Host), but it can be really laggy, looks like the Multiplayer could still need some optimization, or Servers like in GTA ONLINE.

The only thing i dont like so much is, that damage is just shown as scratches, and nothing can fall apart or get a hole inside the hull, and that there are no bigger editors, for bigger vehicles.

But i still can recommend this game to everyone who like playing physic sandbox games.

Small Pro/Contra List:

Pro:

+Good physics
+Multiplayer
+You can build everything you can imagine
+Has surrival, and advanced technology and logic
+Great replayabillity
+Nice and active community
+Developers wich listen to the community
+Frequent updates and patches
+Nice and huge map (now with arctic biom)
+Discord Server where you can also meet the developers
+Bug Report and Feature Suggestion Tool is avaiable direct in the main menu
+Has big possibilities, and its still in early access

Contra:

-Laggy Multiplayer with only 6 Players (I would expect more players,
because for some missions and activities we could need more players)
-Some bugs (but sometimes really funny, like flying ships)
-Too small editor space

One of the things, the game could need, is some more weather systems, like tornadoes, and some natural disasters, to bring bit more action in the game.

Thanks again to all who read it completely till to the end.

36,49306058,english,"Do you like:

1) ...Lego Technic?

2) ...the hit animated children's early 00's cartoon, Rescue Heroes?

3) ...entire rooms dedicated to large, elaborate train loops?

4) ...those weird, highly specific simulator games Europeans foam at the mouth over?

5) ...your job as a plumber?

6) ...to ignore your duties and get messages pop up telling you how someone in the Arctic froze to death because you can't reach the mission site as you haven't gotten away from your starter island?

7) ... make submarines specifically to crawl up to flaming tankers, then breach the water's surface armed with rows of water-cannons to put out the fire?

If you said yes to any of these, then you will like Stormworks: Build & Rescue. With a simple to learn, difficult to master building system - you build anything from small jet-skis or ski-doos to giant Coast Guard motherships decked out with custom made helicopters, dinghies, rafts among other vehicles. The actual vehicle construction is incredibly minute: You make the hull, distribute the various necessary systems to maintain an engine (air, exhaust, coolant, fuel and engine output), link the various buttons, levers and auto-mated systems to various mechanical and data outputs and then spawn your vehicle, hoping that you linked up all of the internal systems properly.

After your one-rotor transport helicopter turns into a four-rotor fire fighting, diesel-tugging flying aircraft carrier - you must then prepare for various missions with solutions that simply cannot be solved with a single vehicle, causing you to develop your Coast Guard fleet in a way to maximize coverage of your service, lest you stay in bed and skip all the pleas for help as you wait for a mission you can actually handle.

The games visuals are blocky and simplistic, but are nonetheless pleasant to the eyes.

The audio is below average, but it is to be expected when almost nothing is prebuilt and prepared.

The physics are surprisingly robust and thankfully leave out certain aspects of physics that would cause the game to be incredibly difficult/tedious to manage.

The mechanics are fairly easy to learn after a few short tutorial videos or some trial and error and can be applied to any type of vehicle archetype you can think of (trucks, jet skis, helicopters, jets, prop aircraft, gyrocopters, motorboats, corvettes, trains, tug boats, cruise liners, submarines, oil tankers and even rockets). But the depth is presented with a 'redstone' (if you are familiar with Minecraft's 'coding') mechanic that allows for complex interactions between different portions of your vehicle.

Easy: Linking a button to your engine to start it up.

Medium: Connecting a PID Controller to an altitude reader and using it in tandem with a keypad to enter specific coordinates that are then relayed to a helicopters up/down collective system to allow it to auto-level itself at a specific altitude.

Difficult: Entering the scary world of microcontrollers to create an automatic transmission to help reduce lever/button bloat on your submarine's control base.

Overall, despite being an Early Access game, to me it shows a similar effort and quality put forth similar to other successful Early Access games like Rimworld. I would also recommend it to parents of kids who like the mechanics of various types of vehicles as the game can provide an excellent outlet of creativity. It completely lacks any sort of typical violence presented in modern games, as all the missions involve rescuing people or cargo from precarious situations.

The game is currently an 8/10 for me, but might possibly reach higher as more parts, missions and mechanics are introduced!",1551493377,1551493377,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,True,76561198018409113,253,10,8238,1866,4823,1601612202,,

I just finished adding a cruise control system to my boat complete with input consoles and displays so you can just input coordinates and the boat will drive there. It comes complete with a micro-controller design system that lets you add pretty much any logic you can think of (It even includes memory, flip-flops, clocks, control logic, you could design and build a fully functioning cpu with it).

Want to make a pool with pumps and buttons that can fill to differn't points? Can Do

Want to make a deployable rescue system that detects when the boat is sinking opens hatches and launches lifeboats? Can do

Want to make a boat that deploys a roof in the rain? Yup

Want to build a train? Yes, it has trains

-Fresh art design

90,49043667,english,"This is basicly “LEGO technic - the game” with procedurally generated missions where you save people, put out fires, transport etc.

You can build pretty much any type of machine that moves on this earth, car, truck, train, plane, jet, helicopter, ships from dingeys to submarines and aircraft carriers (although the build areas are too small for real sized ones they can be quite large anyway).

You have engines, rail tracks, wings, rotors, magnetic grabbers, propellers, water nozzles and highly customizable programmable blocks to play with, I’ve played a tidy amount of Space Engineers which is similar to this but in space and I have to say this runs smoother and has better tools for building than it does. 

One thing to say however is that troubleshooting your creations that don’t work properly can be a ‘beach’ and you might spend hours trying to get something really complex working, and the game really doesn’t hold your hand.
An example: I just spent a couple of hours building my first jet engine on a test bed, but the engine wouldn’t start, I racked my brain but decided to google a tutorial instead of doing it the hard way, turns out I had placed the components in the correct order but I had thought the arrow that indicates air flow direction was indicating traveling direction so I had to turn each component 180 then redo all the fuel piping since it no longer lined up. That took me 2-3 minutes, if I had decided on trial and error it might have taken hours before I had figured it out.

Singplayer is fantastic but the multiplayer needs some work. The sync issues and the lag is horrible and anything bigger than a small speedboat will lag the game crazily bad for all parties. Because of the Peer to peer system the game has right now.

95,48990866,english,"There are two parts to this game - the vehicle building and the missions you get to use these vehicles in.

If you play in ""Advanced Vehicles"" mode - the building part is outstanding. The tools for it are great, the editor works really well and the copy/paste functionality and ability to have modular blueprints is amazing. For example - I can design an engine setup of 16 engines and the panel to control them, then copy and paste that into a different ship. I can then paste in my gearbox controls and paste in my pilot seat setup from an existing build.  This takes the bulk of tedium out of the process - you never really find yourself building the same thing for 20th time.

Really I can't say enough good things about the building tools and the flexibility they offer. The parts selection is vast to the point of being overwhelming. In short, whatever plane, ship or chopper you want to build - you can do it here. In fact, you can build flying ships if you're so inclined...

So here comes the bad part - you built your amazing vehicle - and decide to do some missions - that'll be fun right?

Well - it's not. The bulk of the missions are hauling runs, take 4 scientists from here to there, bring these 4 crates over here. I get it, rescue is about taking things away from danger. Except in the vast majority of these missions, nothing is actually happening. You're just hauling some boxes that you need to pick up 4km away to the drop off point 7km away. Then you get to haul 4 dudes from the village over to the oil rig - all in dull calm weather.

Career mode also falls flat on it's face as the reward pace is very slow. In 20 hours of doing career runs, I still don't have anything bigger than the small engine greatly limiting what vehicles I can create. I guess I could keep putting time in and maybe just maybe I'll eventually get the blueprints I want - but it's slow and every single time you are rewarded with items you already have it's a slap in the face. The dull missions and inability to buy blueprints drag the enjoyment of the game way down.

I really wish all missions had some sort of risk to them, I should never find myself watching netflix while being Sea Uber to a bunch of scientists who want to get to some island. Where is the risk? Where is the challenge? Give me something. Give me something to worry about other than the soul crushing boredom of watching the 6km distance slowly drop to 5....4....

It just isn't fun to run deliveries for hours only to realize that not a single reward you got brought you any closer to building bigger or cooler ships.

There is a mission editor in the game, so I suppose I could fix all those dull missions myself - but it's not really what I signed up for and worse yet - they aren't added to career mode. The bulk of the player base lives in creative and just builds cool stuff - if that is what does it for you - buy this game. You will not find another title with the same level of detail applied to terrestrial vehicles.

Unfortunately if you actually want to have a sense of thrill and excitement when you use your creations, this game will leave you hanging. At least at this time - it's still an EA game and if the devs put the same amount of effort in the missions as the building tool set, it will be pretty good.

In short, I very much recommend this game if you want to play around with building stuff. I can't recommend this game if on the other hand you want to play around with the stuff you build....",1550164764,1550164859,True,1,0,0.505936145782470703,0,True,False,True,76561197972608891,637,80,1386,0,1386,1550163513,,
96,48980584,english,"I don't write reviews for games. But, hell, I feel like this is needed. 

I cannot stress enough how much Stormworks means to me. This is a fantastic game that really lets me allow my creativity to flow. The Singleplayer, while others claim it's boring, allows me to test designs and build to my heart's content. The multiplayer is equally as enthralling, especially when my friends and I are trying to build something ridiculous. Many laughs have been had there. 

Forever, I've felt like I've had so many ideas in my mind of stuff I wanted to make (I used to love Legos as a kid) but I'm not too awful capable of drawing anything/physically making anything. My hands just don't work like my brain wants 'em to. But, Stormworks presents an easily accessible outlet for those vehicle designs and brings them to life. 

I do have a few quarrels with the game. The sizes on some of the basic building blocks can certainly be tweaked. I'd really some smaller blocks just to add a bit of detail, and maybe some rounded ones. Also, the vehicle physics still need a little work, but they're good for what they are. 

Aside from those two things, I find Stormworks to be a true gem and I play it nearly every day after getting yelled at by customers. It's a great, stress-free release.

I need to learn the capabilities and the different architechture of this game to understand the system better, its hard to learn or.. its easy and fun to get into, but its hard to master is what im trying to say.

The game can get laggy at times when loading bigger structures, but my 1070 is handling this fine so im not worried about it. Hopefully i can find better vehicles that have entrances humans / your player can enter, as ive found several vehicles that cant be entered because the jumping height of your characher isnt big enough.. Which has made a stop for me several times when spawning a plane, boat and one time a car.

The game can probably be more optimized, but its ""EA"" as in ""Early Access"", so i bet they will get better with each update and i hope to see more of this in the future.

The only downside to this game is a couple of minor bugs in the settings im worried of, like advanced mode/setting keep turning itself off while im in the game and the jumping height not being good enough for many planes / vehicles.

I look forward to upcoming updates and fixes, ive only discovered spawning and havent delved too much into the game, but with more hours put into it, i can see myself creating my own engie's and whatnot.

80,48350946,english,"Unique, fun, and challenging gameplay. Create unique machines and vehicles and attempt to carry out all sorts of missions in a fictional seascape.

This game is really like no other game out there. There are multiple gameplay modes, such as creative for those who just enjoy building machines and testing them, to career permadeath survival modes which require you to take care before taking off on your first test flight in your new helicopter.

There is a very brief in-game tutorial that the game requires you perform before you can try other game modes. The tutorial really only covers the Basic version of the game. So Advanced vehicle creation, configuration, and all that it entails is something you'll really have to go looking online for. Luckily there are a ton of YouTube tutorial available, and an official Discord channel to help.

The progression in career mode is fun. You're given a small starting budget, and tasked with some basic missions like ferrying oil rig workers. As you complete missions, you gain money and unlock new parts to create more complex vehicles which can accomplish more difficult jobs such as handling large sensitive science equipment.

Everything factors into the missions. From weather, to time, to distance, to the mission objective itself. Will you have enough fuel? What's the weather like, will your boat be able to handle the rough seas? Will you need more seats than your craft has? Each mission can send you back to the drawing board as you edit and work on your vehicles. Eventually, you'll find yourself handling a fleet of Coast Guard, tanking, and shipping equipment throughout your growing number of owned island ports, and other industries. 

There's also Career mode in multiplayer, but at the moment, there is only one host and that host must be online for the players to continue wherever they last left off. 

The devs are active and post an update about every week with some new content, large or small.

Jk, the boxes float in the ocean, can't be bought and always give nice stuff.

For real though, this game is a lot of fun.

Pro's
1. Advanced building system and physics
2. Also the option to build simple stuff, do whatever you want
3. No pay to win and reasonable price
4. Nice voxel graphics
5. Lot of freedom in with what and how you do things
6. Content keeps getting added
7. Both multiplayer (lan) and singleplayer
8. Steam workshop

Cons
1. Some bugs, it's early access, what do you expect..
2. Can feel a little slow
4. Voxel graphics might not be for everyone

Here are my issues with it:
1. It is obvious that the developers know their code but they ignored the first (and really only) rule of gaming: make it fun. It is obvious that they are Type - A personality: very organized people with a strong sense of order and solid ethic - they just lack creativity and the artistic endeavor, to again, make it fun. They jumped on the (terribly overdone) minimalist Minecraft boat (pun internded) and attempted to inject a lot of complicated mechanics.
2. Why do I care how the freaking engine is wired to the battery and why do I all of a sudden have to be an electrical engineer? The game is called Stormworks not Electricianworks.
3. I spent 15 minutes in the tutorial to pick up a stupid crate and then put it in the boat. This was just a load of annoying. Again, not fun.
4. Then I had to spend another 5 minutes driving the boat a seemingly useless 800 billion miles to a hospital. It's like they thought if they made you drive a boat REALLY far that it makes it a BIG game. No. It just makes it annoying. Then I finally get to the pier (remember, this is an unavoidable tutorial that does NOT allow you to open sandbox mode until you finish it). So, I try to jump out of the boat with the annoying box/crate and throw it up on the pier while i jump on the pier (what the hell?) and I'm missing and not understanding these mechanics and at this point I'm beyond annoyed - I'm angry. It's now feeling like I paid to do algebra homework. I run the stupid crate to the stupid hostpital and anti-climactically drop the crate in the dropzone. Woo frikkedy hoo, I gain some random ""i-don't-care,-I-thought-I-was-going-to-drive-boats-and- helicopters-in-crazy-weather"" parts and money and bluprints and I REALLY don't care., I frikkedy run down to my boat because I can't run fast enough to escape this game and I feel like a spoon-tracheotemy would be more fun at this point. Here's the kicker - I have to then return to my island or whatever, so I try to turn my boat around. What happens? I beach the stupid boat and can't un-beach it. Game over. I'm getting my money back.

Guys, a little friendly advice - stop taking your game so seriously because it comes through in the gameplay. Get outta the office/house, Go get drunk. Get laid. Punch someone in the face (actually, strike that last one - this game already made me want to).

60,47569071,english,"Brilliant game, of course there is the glitches with boat damage and collision physics (to be expected with an E.A. game) but it is really simple in it's concept and design, the building can take a while to get used to but the creations you can come up with are limitless.
Of course, it is a shame there is a max size a ship can be (unless with custom missions) but I can imagine this is because even ships built in the space you can build can lag up the game until you get to open sea.

I'd love to see the pressure mechanic apply to boats aswell, of course this may mess with submarine creations- but maybe we can apply a press logic module which allows the player to change the pressure of the ocean on the creation- that would be great. Of course that would be expensive in career.

I'd also love to see maps added into the game, there is a map already, but I'd prefer a block which you could place onboard a ship which you can view the entire map without exploring it. Of course the 'm' map can still exist, but the boat map block has it all explored, of course the counter to this could be a more pixelated image.

A story or proper objective would work really well, depending how you go at it, I'd love some sort of story where you explore some under water cave or investigate an anomaly.

I'd also like more diverse creatures instead or just sharks and fish, also- I'd wish they would be a lot more dangerous since sharks spend half the time too far deep in the water, and most the time don't attack you since there is only one or two nearby. Larger creatures like Krakens and Megalodons could roam deeper waters.

Also, block damage I would like to be a lot more interesting, instead of just scratches it would be great if blocks could break off under too much pressure, I would hope this would make rooms vincible instead of invincible, this would work really well with the pressure mechanic I mentioned earlier, with glass breaking or shattering. Hopefully this would make players careful in battering water and create more diverse sinking options.

I would also like wind to rock airplanes or something airbourne, since otherwise planes / helicopters are immune to virtually everything apart from running out of fuel.

That is all I have to say, this game is great and I'd would want to see the playerbase expand. Imagine 8 players in one server all creating flying trains. Overall, there must be a setting that disables / enables the suggestions mention. Since it would help people to do roleplay or whatever in an undersea base.

Because of a serious injury, I am stuck at home unable to move for a long while, and this game was a breathe of fresh air for my humble self.

It is quite impressive to have such level of freedom and creation when building a ship or an aircraft.
Co-op really adds a different dimenssion to the game, especialy in the highest difficulties.

Of course, knowing logic circuitery is a must if you plan on playing this game seriously, but, hey! it can be learned!

The game can probably be a little more optimized, and have a bit more variety but well it's still in Alpha... With all of this it would be perfect for the genre

85,47392891,english,"This game has gone so far in it's development, and I never anticipated it to be as good as it is now. The features that attracted me to this game was the building ( the advance building is very impressive ), the cool missions, the water physics, and how players can walk around ships freely while they are moving without constantly being pushed backwards. I love how the game detects sealed compartments and keeps water from not only visually clipping into them, but also if water does get in, the ship might sink. I am very glad that the devs added trading and trains, because this opens a whole new world of economy. Previously, there was not a very good use for cargo planes for example, other than maybe supply drops that haven't been added yet. But now I can see the devs adding products to buy/sell like wooden crates that would be perfect for a cargo plane to transport. They have currently added the ability to buy/sell fluids like oil that make oil transport ships and tank train cars very effective as an economy tool. As hinted before, I would also love to see physical cargo crates and passengers also as part of the economy. With the direction that the devs are going, this game would be vast because of all the roles that people could play. To name a few: passenger train, cargo train, coast guard ship, fire-fighting plane, rescue helicopter, transport helicopter, transport ship, tanker ship, passenger plane, cargo plane, research boat, research sub, semi truck, bus, and ambulence. The possibilities are endless. They haven't yet added research into the game either, but based on all the trenches and underwater locations, it's almost safe to speculate that the devs have plans for it in the future. That brings me into my next point, the developers of this game. They frequently release new updates, which let's the users know that their purchase of the game very much supports it's development. They are always adding a few interesting features here and there to keep the community interested as well as major updates now and then. The graphics of this game are amazing too. Some people criticize the low poly art, but I appreciate it because in my opinion, it looks great, and my computer is a little outdated so the low poly helps save some frames. I get lag whenever I travel to the nuke reactor. Lag in this game is interesting because the physics engine slows down along with the graphic frames. This means that you won't miss out on any of the action if you do lag, but it is also very boring to complete a mission 50% longer simply because it is at the nuke for my case. As my last point, logic has greatly improved the game. It doesn't matter how good you are at using it because there are all degrees of difficulty in your logic creations. You can use simple logic to add interesting lights, more advanced logic to hold and altitude of a plane/ helicopter, or you even have the freedom to create a complex full autopilot for a ship where you simply enter the coordinates of your destination, and the ship does the rest.

I suggest playing in survival mode, because it's so much more satisfying when a vehicle you built, actually works. Survival difficulty has a more advanced building system, for example you have to build systems to make your engine actually work, like cooling, fuel tanks, batteries, generators, exhausts, air intakes, etc, and you have to connect them up with pipes, and some of the stuff you build can be programmed by you, for example gearboxes where you can change the ratio. It is such a good feeling when you built your first working engine, and working vehicle, and complete missions with it. You can make a vehicle as simple or as complicated as you want. You can build anything you can think of. As long as the laws of physics allows it. Oh, and the game has a dynamic weather system, which is great. Some days there is a huge storm, and others is very calm and sunny.

Best purchase of the year!!! 
Thank you very much, this game is awesome and the developers are worknig really hard delivering content and corecting Bugs, one can feel the conection with the community and is an early release experince to be noted and quoted as a reference. 
Best value for your money.!!!
Awesome developers!!! multiplayer shaping good
This game has been a pleasant surprise for me, I barely had the news of it since it mixes (excellently) two very precious genres for me, construction of vehicles and rescue.
The game engine runs great even in an old system like mine. 
To sum up:

Pros
-Powerful and simple 3D editor to build vehicles
-Undemanding game engine
-Missions mode to unlock parts and resources in the game
-Creative mode
-Wide selection of parts and parts
-The physics manages to transmit the difficulties of the operations according to the climate and the time of day.
-Opportunity to share designs in the Workshop
-Multiplayer (in development)
-Customization of avatars
-Very few Bugs so far (at the moment the developers are active)
-Tutorial

Cons
-Little information about the use of some parts, a manual is missing but this is acceptable due to the early state

Final words
If you are accustomed to early state games then this is a very necessary acquisition, you will love the fast developing pace, constantly adding fixes and new content. If you are a fan of the construction of vehicles with blocks you must also have it and if you like rescue games too.
I think this game stands out from the others similar in the combination that makes the genres, has much of what you can find the avid builder and designer of vehicles and makes it more interesting by giving your designs to have rescue plans to meet.
For me the price is in line with the content presented so far and the possibilities of development are enormous.
Everything will depend on the management of finance of the developers, the success in sales and the participation of the community, if these factors point in the right direction we could be facing a jewel.",1520167681,1542837644,True,4,0,0.513888895511627197,0,True,False,True,76561198022953922,88,39,34263,1234,16355,1601262304,,

Negative Aspects
🔸Bugs bugs bugs and more bugs each update fixes one bug and creates 500 more fucking bugs
🔸no TSAA setting anymore and now the game is not really good on low ends anymore 
🔸Multiplayer is fucking buggy as shit and since the parachute update now i can fucking join without it saying disconnected
🔸Crashing when spawning planes

It's fun. Insanely fun. I really haven't done any missions (i've done a few), I spend most of the time building, testing, and tweaking my ships. I've made some ships where you have a jet turbine to haul butt in the sea, but if the turbine becomes damaged, you push a button and out folds some propellors to take you back in.

85,45842232,english,"This game was quite a bit of fun when I first purchased it and for awhile after that. 

However with recent updates it has become apparent that the developers don't do much play testing before they push out updates. 

There have been so many changes to the core gameplay and how engines work that it's difficult to keep up with and make working ships. The advanced mode content was a very welcome change but has since become a chore as electricity generator, propeller function, and gearboxes received a large nerf. 

Just today the devs released an update where vehicles spawn without fuel and require filling before setting sail. They added a filling station to the stock island but you can't even get the fuel connector over the railing on the side of your boat slip.  Not to mention that once you get it hooked up you have to climb all the way back up to the tank to start the filling process. 

This just demonstrates their obvious lack of play testing of their own updates. This combined with the fact that they push these updates out on Fridays when a lot of people have time to play on the weekends just leads to mounting frustration with this game.

Also the workshop have many great vehicles to play arround with or to get inspiration from.

The game also have a survival mode that I still have not tried, but i'm sure can provide a lot of fun for those who wish to get a greater challenge.

Pros:
- Build what you wish, your imagination is your limit.
- Performance seems to be good, at least for me. (on a mac book pro with no dedicated graphics)
- Great value for your money, game has a lot of content allready and gets continually updated with more blocks and features

Cons:
- Game is not in a good balanced state at the moment, for example engines, gearboxes etc (as of November 4 2018)
- Due to early access and frequent update vehicles often break between updates.
- Again, the game is Early access and can from time to time do wierd stuff. This will of course get better over time as development progresses",1541333060,1541333060,True,9,0,0.630390167236328125,0,True,False,True,76561198072142825,243,5,64378,1502,9069,1601892196,,

In the future I can only see this game getting more and more incredible, my only worry is that the developers become 'stuck in their ways' and don't listen to the community.

First off, the artstyle and overall world aesthetic is beautiful. The ocean water physics is the best I've ever seen, and is a high point for the immersion.

You find parts scattered around the world. You can alter day/night cycle by sleeping. Weather can change day-to-day, and the world is really neat.

[b]Pros:[/b]
+The artstyle and overall world ambience is beautiful and very immersive.
+The sandbox missions and day and night cycle all work really well to add more 'game' to the engineering/building experience.
+The ocean water physics is the best I've seen.

+Multiplayer would be fun.

[b]Cons:[/b]
-Needs further optimization.
-I'm not an engineer, but from what I gather - the ship building system is not purely logic/reality based. That's okay for me, but I think some people may want to know that they need to learn this system.
-Dare I say the physics system is about 10% just too wonky or fiddly. Cargo flying all over and losing passengers in some pretty cartoon-ish ways. Again, not a deal-breaker, but something I should mention.

29,45383941,english,"I didn't know what to expect from this game.  I was at first overwhelmed by the looks of the game.  Anything that gets you to design anything is usually a bit much for me.  My creations in other games never really look like much, but this game makes it easy and fun.

First you do the tutorial which covers the bare basics.  Movement and simple design in basic mode.  The tutorial is the bottle feeding before you eat your steak.

After the tutorial you can continue in that game mode or start a new game mode and the difficulty options are plenty.  Sharks, health, fast travel and moving your vehicle back to base are just some of the options you can click.  Also there is starting money, starting island and the other like.  Creative mode and career/survival mode are also tossed in there.

The game is 99% water.  The rest are islands with unique structures.  An island for a hospital, one for a airport, one for a nuclear power plant and so on.  

As you start the game, you design your first vehicle which typically is a boat if you chose the default start.  Missions are given to you either while you're exploring or sleeping.   Mostly of what I've seen is ""deliver this person/good to this other location"".  Sometimes they get a little redundant, but...they get a little interesting sometimes.  Completing these missions grants you parts/blueprints or money.  Mostly all three at once.  You can have a part in your stock, but if you have the blueprint you can still buy the part if it's not in stock.  Ideally you complete missions, build bigger and more robust vehicles and buy more real estate to support your endeavor.

The world you play in is a little dry.  No AI other than what's involved in your mission.  I would like to see the occasional AI boat/plane or helicoptor go by every once in awhile.  You can explore though.  During your travels you may come across loot crates which can also contain parts and money.

The vehicle building though?  COOOOOOOOOOOL.  I have spent many hours in career and creative mode tinkering with the tidbits.  You want to build an electric ship and charge it with another vehicle?  YOU CAN!  Want to build a sub?  YOU CAN!  Want to build a refueling tanker for helicopters and other ships?  The available tools at your fingertips just amazes me when constructing.

Few engineering games have that enough of a sense of variety about them to create that sort of a bond. Stormworks lets you get away with building pretty much anything, as long as it floats.

The simulation of the sea is fantastic. Sometimes it's this big comfy blue blanket you can putter around on all day and everybody is friends. Other times the wind, lightning and waves are trying to batter you to death. The only thing stopping them from doing that is the ship, boat, helicopter or whatever other machine you've built to protect yourself. So you need to build it well.

Lastly the world is so wholesome. You transport important cargo, you rescue people, you help people out with their day to day stuff. It's low key and comfy a lot of the time but there's often a life or death situation waiting round the corner. Rescuing people from mother nature throwing a hissy fit is a hugely underrated activity in games.

It's early access and at the point I'm reviewing it reliability is an issue, but it loads up pretty fast and autosaves often so it's more of an inconvenience than the sort of issues that'll cost you hours of design time. It's also pretty easy to play multiplayer with a few friends if one of you has a reasonable PC and connection to host it, you don't need a server. The game handles multiple players on the same vehicle really well too, so playing the missions in a group is easily done and fun.

So, yeah. Highly recommend. Perfect game if you were into things like Space Engineers but wanted better multiplayer and more ways to put your vehicles to use.

65,45003837,english,"I've played a lot of crafting/building games, but this one pushes the bar to a whole new level.

Simultaneously a triumph of both the genre and 'how to do early access right', the development over the last seven months has been nothing short of staggering. Progress is steady, community feedback is given the priority it deserves without overtaking the creative vision of the designers, and the game is kept fresh and interesting with every new update. New mechanics, new concepts, new mission types... the game just keeps on giving every time.

The recent addition of the Survival update put this game on a similar level to Kerbal Space Program for me, in terms of complexity vs reward; the more effort you put into your vehicles, the more versatility they have. The mechanics are intuitive and flexible, the depth possible with creations already trumps anything possible in other sandbox games... whether it's setting up logic circuits to control systems, creating custom doors, or attaching vehicles to each other, Stormworks does it better than 95% of other games that attempt these things.

The vehicle editor is incredibly robust, and it's clear that the creators of the game have a passion for playing other similar games. All of the mistakes you'll see in other, similar vehicle editors are completely absent, replaced instead with more functionality. It's simple to use, intuitive to learn, but rewarding to master; the perfect mixture for keeping building fun.

Having objectives and missions right from the beginning of early access means the game isn't starved for content like most of its peers have been, and makes the game incredibly playable and fun even in its early stage of development. Missions are also available on the Workshop thanks to the Mission Editor, basically giving you a potentially infinite amount of replayability.

The last time a game showed this much potential during an early stage was when I first experienced KSP. For me though, despite not having the ability to travel to space, the flexibility and depth on offer here is far superior.

Stormworks = I like it ;-)

My first rescue mission was a failure since i had accepted a mission to move and deploy a drone, however i had no machine to lift the drone form land and into the ocean.

My next mission was to pickup 4 inspectors and sail them to another location and i thought that is simple and a good beginner mission but I was very fast reminded that sometimes in life things are not that simple.
The beginning was easy i just sail to an island and ask them to jump into my small boat and off we went, with calm sea and I thought to my self this was a bit ehh borring... But after sailing a few km the weather all of a sudden started changing and the waves become 1-2m high and I kind of enjoyed my self since my little boat was doing pretty good without tipping over or anything due to me being a good skipper.
A few minutes later things changed dramaticly.... the sun went down and night came, and a big storm started out on the ocean and my simple transport mission now all of a sudden turned into a kind of survival kind of thing since I was again and again hit by 10-20m high waves that throw my boat arround and i desided that it was hopeless to sail and instead i turned the boat towards the waves and just lay there still ""riding"" off the storm.
The storm was a huge surprise to me and i instant knew this game was something special and cool.

After 10-15 minutes like this and saving my people two times from being flushed into the ocean  i think the wind changed direction and all of a sudden i could use the waves and use my boat as a kind of surfboard just sailing on the top of hte wave in the direction i had to go... I fast sail the last 1,5km to shore and was almost dreaming about kissing the island when i see it... To my big surprise it was not an island that was my destinaton but an Oil rig out in the ocean, with 10-20m high waves hitting the legs of it, and the stairs i should climp up was hit by big waves again and again.. actual my little boat even was on top of the waves somethimes up so high that it could have landed on the stairways so some insane waves that no little boat can handle.... But once at a time i ""pickup"" the inspectors and climp up the stairs and ask them to stay up high while i get the other... But they did not always listen and was ripped away by the ocean and i had to save them yet again, while swinning and climing thinking that now im gona die.
But finaly i delived them and got my 1000usd for the job...  I was so happy and proud i did it, since it was really difficult.
Then i started to explore the rig and found some spare parts i could use for my future ship and other details such as a sling i could have used as an elevator for the inspectors  ( dooh )..
Anyway I continue and bought my self a small island with a container crane on it and i bought a medium size hull with a chair, wheel, and engine and propellar... so now i have a medium size ship that is much more stable for my next mission even though i could not afford to build a cocpit or anything on it.. but the foundation is there and it can be used and ih ave BIG hopes this will make my life more easy.

The ship building with blocks work really well, and you can even assign commands to buttons such as turn on engine, lower this, or move crane and such stuff. THat is cool and give you a kind of this is a real ship/plane/heli/boat you are operating.
You make things work by dragging lines inbetween blogs.. Example from battery to pushbutton to engine and then when you press the button the engine will start.
In the lastest update the game now also have gearboxes, and fluid systems so you even have to run pipes to/from your engine with water form the ocean to cool down, and fuel lines to the engine and excaust and air intake to make the engine work.
I think this is really cool and add so much more to the game since now you cant sail forever but need to example refule your helicopter or ship just like in real life.
You can even make a hollow sealed room and use it as example one big fuel tank, or as water ballast tanks in ships or submarines.
By the way the game come with an craetive mode and a careere mode that let you select what kind of gameplay you like.

In freeplay you have all parts avaliable from the start so you can build anything, and you can even select a simple or advanced construction options so example making the enigne work is more simple.
in career mode you have various difficultys and again options about if you want all parts avaliable and if you can die, injured and such things... if you die you just respawn in your base but typical loose your ship and it will cost you to spawn a new one. 
A cool think about the game is example helicopters that you can make hover above example a ship.. with the hoist system you can grap the sling and if you design the sling well you can while you are in the sling go up/down and even attack the end of the sling to a ship if it have a connector so the sling dont move away... example not so cool if your helicopter is in a hover and the ship are pushed away by the waves, then how you get up again ?  ;-)
In career mode you start out with xx amount of basic things but as you complete missions you get random new parts, or you can find the parts in the game world.
I think this work really great... ( but i hope they someday make a research tree so people can unlock the parts they like the most since it can be a bit tiring to do missions and not finding a specific part that you really want.

Other thing i like about the game is that the game world is a ""seed"" and random generated as far as i know. And the weather is changing all the time, and can really make things easy or even hard.
That is so cool... the waves on the ocean is very well done, and wind and physics well cool.
- let me give you an advice....: becourse you can sail, does not mean you have to sail.
with other words if there is a big storm with giant waves, then maybe it would be better to stay in the harbour than sailing, since you sometimes just have to give up fighting the waves and just ride off the storm just laying still with the stern into the waves and wait.

The game is in early access but it is pretty cool, and i have high hopes for it, and i can imagine having a rescue crew in multiplayer slining down my buddy to a ship with a helicopter and such.

I can today highly recommend the game, and its even cheap.
the game also today have more missions and variation than example 1 year ago, so there are more to do such as fighting fire, rescue submarines and transporting cargo and more passengers missions.

PS.. i forgot to say that the physics in the game is really good.. .Example your little boat is effected by the amount of people onboard and get tail heavy and such things... that is a nice detail.. and same goes with larger ships that carry heavy things, you need to think about the design and weight balanst tanks, fluids, electricty and such things ;-)

Dev team is ON IT!!!!
Game looks great. not sure if it is shaders or something else they do.
Physics of the game are amazing... i have play ship simulators in the past and they seem to have a good hold on the physics. The rock of the ship and the way it acts in the water is amazing. Can't say much for the Aircraft but i know the boats feel good to me.
Missons of the game are fun and entertaining with a bit of challenge thrown in there.. after all you have to build your own tools to complete the missions.
FUN!

Overall the game has a ton of potential, however, certain aspects still require extensive further development, in-particular, multiplayer which at this point is almost unplayable. The concept the game brings to life however is amazing, and as someone who does SAR in real life, having a game where you can custom build and edit your rescue equipment, and then perform rescues with said equipment is awesome.

[h1] Pro's & Cons[/h1]
[b]Cons[/b]
[i]As of writing this review these are the notable cons I have taken notice of, this review will hopefully be updated as the game improves.[/i]
[list]
    [*]Unplayable multiplayer: You will spend most of your time lagging and having FPS issues.
    [*]Sparse ""rescue"" events: Many of the events are delivering supplies and putting-out fires.
    [*]Optimization in general: Needs a ton of work, to run big and complicating builds you are going to need a beefy computer.
[*]Multiplayer can only be played with Steam friends, so no open servers, yet at least.
[/list]

[b]Pros[/b]
[list]
    [*]Amazing concept, which has a ton of potential.
    [*]Steam Workshop integration.
    [*]Weather is really cool and it is rather fun to operate boats in massive squalls and do missions.
[/list]

[h1] Verdict[/h1]
[b]A game that touches on an exciting neich and has tons of potential, but that is still very much in early-access.[/b]

13,44514105,english,"Short review here which I can add on to as I go. I've played this for around 90 hours at time of writing. Love every second of this game. Perfect mix of creativity and mission driven setting. Logic system is very simple and easy to connect things with a basic understanding of flow in fluid dynamics and PLC's (programming logic control). The physics are mostly good. I think they could use some work though. Gravity seems to be off a bit.

Things I'd like to see better worked:

Lighting system needs work. For example: I have a boat I built where there are exterior lights lining the hull, just below the water line. I made them blue. Flip lights on and the surrounding water glows blue...and so does the inside of my whole boat in all rooms. Seems to be light bleeding in through material which isn't right. These's also this static looking thing when you use search lights at night. Odd rendering going on there.

An option to use US system OR Metric system. Each cube is a quater meter. So four cubes is one meter. When you look up a boat you wanna build and it's 400' long...leaves some one having to do some math to figure out what that is in meters and quater meters (9.75"" is one block). So better scaling would be cool.

The size limitation of dock I can understand if your dock is enclosed in a building; like the starting island. But when you buy an island and the dock is just one side and the rest is open to the ocean. Why should there be a size limitation for size of anything? I got one boat I want to build that's 610' long to scale. The longest one can build (and this involved me going to XML files and changing perameters around) was 255 blocks in one direction and then another 255 in another plus the block in middle so 511 blocks. This limitation, I understand, has something to do with programming (0-255). But having the ability to only build a boat thats 127.75 meters (415.1875 feet to be exact) doesn't cut it for the big boats we want to build.

I've noted my mouse skipping accross the screen as I pan over to click anything. Not sure what that's about. I don't think I've noticed it in other games I play. So I'm thinking its unique to Stormworks and should be looked at.

The basic color options are nice and will satisfy most applications. But the option to have a color wheel and pick any color would be awesome. Unless it's there and I've missed it this whole time...

Having different sized windows than 3x3 or 3x1 would be cool. Maybe implement a system where one could make, for example, a window size any size by using the grid system the same as the blocks do and the price goes up accordingly to how many blocks you've used to make say a 5x7 or a 6x11. Price per block size for window real esate used.

I keep seeing lots of comments about implemting weapons. I, myself, do not prefere weapons as there are so many shooters out there already. And I think adding weapons is just going to create and enviroment where people are getting shot all the time just because people want to be trigger happy and feel good about themselves...There are certian weapons mounted on some coast guard boats, I'm aware. But they have little impact to what this games ideas are. I saw some one elses comment about there aren't somali pirates so don't bother with weapons lol
The only thing I would suggest is to give an option for a mode for weapons. If someone wants to host a server with weapons on then good for them. But otherwise, I see no need for a weapons system. Not what the core game is about.

This one here is a big one I wanna see fixed. And that would the buoyancy calcs used. Yes, buoyancy is used to model a boat but it's also displacement of fluid. They go hand in hand. Having to have an enclosed system is silly to keep your boat floating. How would anyone build a ship for carrying logs?! (not that logs are in this game...idea maybe?) By these rules it would never work. You see my point...

This is another big one I wanna see fixed or at least modified. The current state for logic components is you push a toggle button. And that button is the sole providing eliment for providing power to a device. Last time I checked, buttons on their own don't provide self power. You need a power supply. I see there is a logic node for doing just that. It is a ""power supply"" That node, in perticular, is almost usless at the moment because buttons provide power on their own. But I think it would be more realistic and allow for better logic system control if say you could add an electric generator to be run off the engines when on and have batteries for when engines are off. Submarines use this very method. Some subs run off batteries for 1-3 weeks at a time. Same thing in a car. Turn key (or push button without clutch and/or brake) and it goes to accessories running off a battery. I thnk some bigger ships use diesel/electric combinations and trains, I know, use that. All that noise you here from a train is just diesel generators. Electric motors are doing all the pulling ....I'm pretty sure you catch what I'm saying here by now.

Maybe give an option for heavier and/or bigger weight blocks? Having to add 150 weight blocks to get the boat balenced correctly is a lot of work. From comment above this. Batteries are heavy and can be used as weights too.

Give a system for how much power is what and how much weight is what. Basic engine is 20,000...ok 20,00 what? Rampaging stallions in the stables? Cute babies, cow power, kilowatts? And the weight. Each block weighs 1...1 what?! Each weight block weighs 10...10...WHAT!!? See what I'm getting at? As someone who does engineering for a living. This drives me bonkers lol.

I'm sure there's more I can say and I will as I progress. Overall this game is so freaking awesome. I can't put it down. If you love designing, building and engineering.

The ocean simulation has, not in appearance but in function, the best wave simulation I have ever seen in a game. The handling of vehicles is made simple by clear logic tools, linking control objects to systems is done visually and with the potential for incredible depth.

What sets this game apart from others in its category are the missions which offer a steady supply of problems to solve. This is what has kept my interest, I don't have to imagine the criteria of a problem, I simply need to think of efficient (or fun) solutions.

37,43952217,english,"After almost 40 housr of play in two days of ownership I'd like to give my review of the game:

Building is fun, what can I say... all building games are fun but what sets this game apart? What grabbed me and drew me in and does it still have that same hold? Well I was plenty of youtube videos as im sure many of you have as well... I decide ok I will invest.
Starting out isn't hard at all the missions are very basic but ramp up fairly quickly requiring you to design new or modify your existing craft to complete your next task, this is where thing cans get a little hairy for some. Unless you are very adept with logic programming the start will be slow. its fun but each thing you build will be extremely basic unless it becomes logic heavy for me at least thats a negative even though in many games im a logic god. I suffered a stin to my ego since there was no instruction on how to use a water pump or build a holding tank I failed the first fire mission.

I think having more parts that provide the same functions without the need for logic is the major snag for most players. I love logic and for the life of me or maybe im having a major brain fart I can't figure out how to make a rail hold its position ot water cannon because I dont know what part does it! Looking online just tells me about how logic functions but not about the corolated part in this game!

I quickly learned that without damage modeling and ""in game"" or ""acvtive"" block removal or editing, for me returning to port just to connect a wire for a door is horrible. So repair/remove/edit tools are needed for player interaction. The fact I can run aground and not damage my hull or sink isn't cool. I feel too much time was spent on each craft for each mission  yet very little to no payout in emotional reward. I'm not talking in game money or parts, i'm talking about the feeling of wanting to do it again because it was fun and not a task. I have to create my own situations and even then not being able to easily sink a ship without the use logic or open doors isnt cool... the fact we can't set a fire in some way either mistakenly or purposely yet have fire fighting mission is emersion breaking. After a while I felt like spending an hour or two on a ship just to hold w for 10 minutes pick up a passenger and drop them off isn't worth the effort.... spending 2+ hours designing and testing a working fire heli for a 5-10 compeltion time on a mission wasn't worth my time and the reward for my effert wasn't met with a sence of accomplishment and pride... just a ""thats it!?!?"" then I fast travele back to the islands because the bland defeningly windy noisy flights wasnt worth my time or effort and I had no reason to actually have to fly back home... emersion breaking/game breaking (ADD FUEL) and properly leve the audio having to turn my volume down each time I start a engine or hit high altitue is beyond annoying at this point.

Before I conclude my review here is a summary of what I'd love to see worked on and emplemented if possible:

1. I love the aspect of ship building and I love the aspect of using logic. I'd just like to see more expandible prefab logic setups for things like ballast control specific to vehicle type. I'd also like more control types that dont require the use of logic to function properly like connecting ""wasd"" to any control automatically recenters... by adding a checkbox to remove that function in the seletion menu of each part type like that can save alot of new non-logic friendly players a big headache and i'm sure increase player base.

2. More starter ships and aircraft types and hull shapes, from beginner to advanced. The workshop is a shortcut on your part guys... Yes a player can get more ships from there but Im talking about starter ships made by the devs tested for missions. Most ships on the workshop are too advance for starter missions and too logic heavy for new players. More things to help with beginner missions as well, like a basic fire boat or fire helicopter so users can see how to reverse engineer them in to better more advanced systems. Each in game boat or design should be available for users in the shipyard menus. This could be expanded on in story mode by haivng basic ship types spawn with the purchase of each new island. 

3. Include missions with AI interaction and assistance such as shipping and assembly of pre-fab structures requiring assembly, stopping and searching ships enroute and refueling. Sometimes it get very lonely on the seas.

4. ADD FUELS!!!!, NO MORE UNLIMITED FUEL!!!
Please add 3 types of fuels, Gasoline, Desil and Avation fuel and one extra liquid Oil. Engines should require a certain type of fuel depending on type of engine. Like water tanks use empty volumes for storage. You can have oil leaks and fuel contamination. Contaminated fuel/water mixed in storage tank will degrade performance until 75% fuel 25% water mix at that point engine will not function and make a weird noise to hint at the player something is wrong. All non water liquids should leave a slick on the water as long as a leak is happening the slick will vanish over time and stay only near the leaking area to indicate a leak if under water.

5. Ship oil for money from rigs to refineries, then buy fuel for your islands and have AI deliver or you can do it yourself! Designate liquid storage location for each island, have perfabe storage tank or build one AI will only pump liquid into labled tanks with propper connections that are accessible. create a shipping empire!

6. Basic AI crew! to help run certian function on larger ships, basicly something like a lua edditor in game we can program the crew to have certain tasks or even a selection menu we can assign tasks.

7. Wardrobes for boats more decor for our ships to hang on walls chairs other than belted ones players can fall from at high angles. Placeable items that will fall slide or break from falls at high angles rotation or enertia (fire hazzards blockage of espace routes).

8. A refilable fire extinguisher like SEROIUSLY

To conclude I see this game as a good investment I know this is early access so my review will reflect that with that said the negatives I do see as things that all can be polished out. I have been following develpoment for a few months and is very steady and updates are very good to spot on what was needed each time. I'd just like to see more things implemented that will gauge me for long periods other than the building aspect because once thats done... theres really nothing much more to do.",1533495319,1533495319,True,14,0,0.632023513317108154,0,True,False,True,76561198001001869,35,4,130772,7095,3247.0,1601658662,,

Many missions ask you to rescue someone, but there's no timer or anything so if it takes you 10 days to respond to a distress call that's just fine.  You can strap injured characters to a stretcher for rescue, but you can also just ""pick them up"" and carry them with you, which causes them to vanish and doesn't slow you down or encumber you in any way. So a one-seater boat with no stretcher or other equipment is perfectly adequate for rescue missions and there's no reason to get any fancier except for your own edification.

Despite the vehicles being voxel-based they are not destructible, and there doesn't seem to be any damage mechanics at all at this stage.  I didn't play long enough to encounter the storm conditions depicted in some of the screenshots; the sea when I played was always quite calm, making travel straightforward but tedious.  The waypoints are so far away sometimes that you will spend a long time just holding the acceleration key and watching the remaining distance counter slowly tick down, which got old fast.

I finally gave up on this game and opted for a Steam refund when it logged in today to give the game another chance only to find my save file was missing, meaning I'd have to start over and repeat the tedious tutorial mission again.  This wouldn't be a dealbreaker if the gameplay itself was more enjoyable.

The most challenging aspect about the game is the dynamic weather and time. You can set off on a rescue mission with your newly built vessel in bright sunshine and nice weather, and quickly find yourself in complete darkness of the night, with strong gusts, fog and meter high waves. Nonetheless the gameplay is very captivating and fun. You should however bring alot of time, because building vehicles is absolutely captivating. I found myself spending hours building, tweaking and adapting my vessels, always finding something more to add. It's addictive fun.

Brilliant idea, and an amazing game.

But it does have it's downsides. For one, multiplayer is only IP address. They're currently working with Steam matchmaking, no ETA yet. The controls are funky with a keyboard, almost impossible to fly a helicopter. Game needs controller support.

Another downside are the missions and possible ideas that haven't been implemented. Just imagine the ideas people can come up with. For one, it would be amazing if you can put an inflatable raft in an airplane, launch/drop it from the air into the water. If it's nearby, the AI can get on the raft so that the helicopter rescuer can get to the people easier and faster. THAT or once you lower the harness in the water, the AI swims to it and grabs onto it. So that you can have a faster extraction.

[b]Pros:[/b]
- Tutorial
- Multiplayer
- Graphics
- Dynamic weather
- Steam Workshop support

[b]Middle:[/b]
- Hoping that multiplayer can get expanded from 3 players to maybe like 8 - 10. Where a crew an manage a vessel, airplane, helicopter and maybe even the tower/ground crew, etc. RP players would love this.
- More in-depth and crazy missions?
[olist]
   [*]Contraband or refugee missions where you need a boat. 
   [*]Cruise ship rescues where you have to find a spot on the cruise ship to winch to. 
   [*]Possible to have scuba gear where the person(s) gets trapped underwater and you need to go underwater and rescue them.
[/olist]

Things that the Coast Guard goes through.

- Maybe let people create maps? Would be pretty cool to see what the community can make and use them.
- We need Human-like AI.

[b]Cons:[/b]
- Limited missions at the moment.
- You need at least 2 or 3 people if you'd like to fly the helicopter. One to fly, one to winch and other to rescue the people in the water or vessel/building.
- Xbox One controller isn't supported. A game like this needs it for flying.
- Flying without a HOTAS controller is horrible.

[h1]Positives[/h1]
[list]
[*]Solid core game loop. Build craft [i]with a purpose[/i]. Think space engineers with besieged and a little KSP thrown in.
[*]Logical and easy to learn construction and logic systems, balancing depth with ease of use.
[*]Fast itteration and updates so far.
[*]Workshop support
[*]Great performance on a high end machine. Game appears to scale very well, even large vessels run fine.
[/list]
[h1]Negatives[/h1]
[list]
[*]Non-randomized  and non-replayable missions. Currently only ~20 missions are available, and they don't continue to rotate. You can download more from workshop. Even if there is only 20 missions in the game would be great if they continued rotating after you complete them.
[*]Progression and Balance issues. Career games can be hard to progress and quite buggy, as the missions stop and you might not have unlocked what you need to progress on the way. Likely a temporary issue and fixed in subsequent updates.
[*]Hard to Fail. Probably my biggest issue other than non-randomized and non-replayable missions: no crash damage, no death, penalty for failure, or time limits. I suspect this is likely something to come in future.

so ok the editors good, i do like the construction on this game its very nice. i also like the way anything you build gets used in the missions  but theres the problem. the big issue i have with the game is the lack of information of what you need for a mission, for example if you need a boat or a helicopter. simple things like tools being listed would help like winches etc. theres nothng worse than driving a boat 3km across the sea to find you need a winch or the thing your picking up is in the middle of an island and you need a heli to pick it up.

i also found myself feeling rather under tooled for some of the early missions that popped up at the start of the game. a good example of this was a mission that came up asking me to drop a drone off at a location. when i got to the drone it felt like the mission required something more like a helicopter to move it even though the game had give me nothing like this yet in parts to make a helicopter, hell i only just started. the best i had was a plane prop.

i like the idea this game has, craft your own rescue vehicles use them in missions but i wish the missions themselves were less vague. the crafting part seems solid but i think there needs to be more of a tutorial for the aircraft side of this and the missions certainly need more description and information added into them. its almost there, but not knowing what missions required just got too frustraiting for me sorry. also maybe order the missions better so parts drop better compaired to the order the missions require you to use those parts; winches, heli blades etc etc.

Every vehicle has a logic system which allows you to use some low-level programing in order to fine tune every aspect of your craft's behavior, meaning that you can do anything from making a boat that intelligently uses it's robotic propellers for self-stabilization to a submarine that can engage in cruise control mode and automatically hold it's heading and speed or even an helicopter that essentially flies itself without you needing to input more than one or two commands for the whole trip.

Vehicles can also be docked with one another, winched by one another, airlifted by one another, stored inside one another, etc... The possibilities are only limited by your creativity, it's really fun stuff.

The game generated missions which you can perform and it will give you money, parts and blueprint unlock. But it is not compulsary to complete them. You can play at your own pace. The blueprint unlock did not just come from the mission but you also can unlock them by going around collecting crate with star symbol on it. And  you have enough money to build stuff.

Just the starting items and fund will keep you engrossed trying to build that uber boat which will not just carry passengers and cargo but also able to survive an open sea big wave. You will encounter big wave if you move 3km away from the islands.

Once that was completed then I had to tow the tanker, boat would capsize which ever way you go and the end result was my boat turned upside down as well as the tanker and me spamming alt f4. I refuse to play anymore until the control/handling system has improved because as of now it is infuriating. The idea of the game and the mission ideas are great but its ruined from the tedious and horrible handling system.",1520115464,1520115464,False,1,2,0.341039657592773438,1,True,False,True,76561198070211180,204,3,318,0,252,1562451998,,

TLDR: Very early access, great fun singleplayer, No working coop at the moment, buy if you want to support development.

The game is great fun and does pretty much what you would expect. I am yet to really see any kind of a ""storm"" maybe I am not that far into the game or maybe it is not implemented in yet. The game is very clearly early access and the Devs do a very good job of telling you EVERYWHERE that you should expect bugs. Overall though the game is a HUGE amount of fun and designing your vehicles to do basic life guard missions at the moment keeps you entertained.

One of the things that pulled me into the early access was the option to play Coop online. I will cut this short and say you can't. I really mean you can't at all at the moment. Sure you can try but trust me it is just not worth it. Remeber though this is a VERY early build and I was not expecting a lot out of the multiplayer.

So for now I am going to let this one rest in my library as I want to support the devs and not ask for a refund. They seem to know what they are doing so far and don't seem like the kind to abandon a game.
