5,Sid Meier's Civilization® III Complete,76802204,english,"Nope, sorry. I liked the original Civilization from the early 90's. This effort though technically better with a lot more content, just falls flat. It has none of the charms of Civ 1, in fact I found Civ 3 to be dull and tedious.
The UI simply stank. One simple reason for this is it not allowing you the standard ""right click to DESELECT unit"". So you always had a unit selected - and as a result often clicked somewhere on the map and off it went, moving to that spot when you did not want it to. So you go to correct it. You click said wrong move unit, but no...... can't select it because of ""this unit has already moved"", BUT what then happens is ANOTHER unit has become active, which the map did not autocentre on (so you had no idea it had automatically selected another unit), and it then starts with unwanted movement!
You probably don't understand all that - it's hard to put into words. But the terrible UI had me constantly wrong moving entire chains of units all over the place.
The UI is very ""non-standard"" and it is difficult to get any information regards anything conveniently. There isn't even a proper world map view - the only one you get is a tiny thumbnail sized map that is just a jumbled mess of colours.
You never know where the enemy is. You never know where anything is. You never have the ""big picture"". You never feel in control. You are constantly fighting your own ministers who are obsessed with building unneeded and extremely expensive ""wonders"" in every city!
Then comes the AI sides. Even on easiest level and lowest aggression, they just all gang up on you. They all stroke each other peckers, but give you the cold shoulder, refusing all diplomatic requests you make - and never offering any treaties or trades to you. They only contact you with one or two unfair tech trades at the start, and from then on it's only to make bullying demands and declare war. They all share techs and treaties with each other though - with great gusto!
Once one inevitably decides to go to war against you, ALL the others follow suit within the next few turns. They never go to war with each other.
All AI civs are also BRUTALLY, profanely cheating, expansionists. This kind of AI is anathema to my usual style and I loathe and detest it. In Civ 3 this AI style is *all* you get....... every game ends the same after 100-200 turns, no matter how aggressively you try to expand, the AI teams just fills up the whole world with one giant ""anti-YOU"" alliance and all declare war and crush you.
This unfairness ruins Civ III. I just had to quit/uninstall in frustration. 
The graphics are also rather bland, nay, downright ugly - the civ leader portraits are a joke - and the music is awful.

Extremely disappointing, I expected so much more from this game. Lets not mince words, I loathed it.

And as for 99% of the reviewers around here thinking the sun shines out this game's arse, well they're wrong! It shows how intelligent these reviewers are when hundreds of them are spam that just say ""relaxing"", ""gud game"", ""is fun"", ""classic"" - hell, one spam review even just said "".""! Others tell outright LIES such as ""every game is different""...... no every game ends in the cheating AI civs all ganging up on you.

It's reviews like these that fool people into wasting their money on dog shit like Civ 3!",1601455731,1601644905,FALSE,3,3,0.473511726,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.66E+16,146,51,556,556,556,1601454779

The game starts of slow, but gets more exciting as the game advances. Interestingly, the beginning and most boring part of the game is the most critical.

52,Sid Meier's Civilization® III Complete,3989179,english,"Best Civilization game in my opinion.
 It has lots of mods, none of the simplistic, casual-like style of the games that came after it, and a relatively good mutliplayer. The art style still retains that design of late 1990's, early 2000's aesthetic. It doesn't try to be cartoony and I love that. Unfortunately later Civ games were less lucky with that.

After more 10 years, here it stood the test of time....

You can't go wrong with the price of it now. All expansions included and no DLC's or anything. A problem that Civ IV, V and VI face. Well worth your money.

 This is a classic strategy game.

Táto recenzia je v Anglickom a Slovenskom jazyku:

I have been playing the mother of all strategies continuously since 1993 and gradually I went through all her titles and subtitles to V. part. Civilization III. became my longest playing heart affair and I was very reluctant to say goodbye to it as I slowly moved on to the V. part. Personally, I think that III. the part is far better than IV., V. and probably VI., but it is a bit outdated and does not offer such a range of gameplay options. What makes it unique, however, is that this is the last Cvilization where you have the opportunity to create truly gigantic empires with countless armies on large maps.

Matku všetkých stratégií hrám nepretržite už od roku 1993 a postupne som si prešiel všetkými jej titulmi aj podtitulmi až po V. diel. Civilizácia III. sa stala mojou najdlhšie hranou srdcovou záležitosťou a len veľmi nerád som sa s ňou lúčil, keď som pomaly prešiel na V. diel. Osobne si myslím, že III. diel je ďaleko lepší ako IV., V. a asi aj VI., ale je už trocha zastaralý a neponúka takú škálu možností v rámci hrateľnosti. Unikátnym ho však robí to, že je to posledný diel, kde máte možnosť vytvoriť naozaj gigantické impéria s nespočetným množstvom armády na veľkých mapách.",1549909677,1598904360,TRUE,2,0,0.545454562,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.66E+16,44,28,3489,0,3489,1588453298

Sid Meier's Civilization III holds classic status for a lot of people, and for good reason. Given its age, it holds up suprisingly well. If this review was only comparing it to its contemporaries, Civilization III would get a perfect score. Unfortunately, when compared to later Civilization games, it begins to falter. The biggest knock against Civilization III isn't really an issue with the game, its just that later games build on its foundation so well. Now that we are on the 6th game in the franchise, there is an entry for everyone. If people want the most modern, sleek, and optimized version of Civilization, they can play 6. If they want an old school feel they can play 4. And if they want a sort of middle ground, the 5th game does a great job balancing those 2 elements. For Civilization III, it plays a lot like Civ 4 but with some pretty popular mechanics missing. To me, Civ 3 doesn't really have a niche that it excels at, and that's why I can't recommend it. Every feature is done better in a different Civ game, leaving little reason for me to revisit it 20 years later.

25,Sid Meier's Civilization® III Complete,72854808,english," So I first want to preface this that I am baised against this game. This is one of the very first game I ever watched some one play and I have very fond memories of sitting next to my dad watching him play this game for hours so it has a very special place in my heart.

Now that being said this game is the Civilization game you should play if your interested in a aggressive empire building strategy where you want to win through domination or by conquering every other nation in the game. From what I've heard civ six and five kind of drop the war aspect and I can tell form experience that Civ fours military strategy is kind of lacking when compared to civ three. This is in part due to later games kind of getting rid of the ""special unit"". In civ three every nation has a unique unit that only they can build and each one of them is differrent and offers an improvement over the regular version any other nation can unlock. These units can be a complete game changer for you and your conquest and thus choosing which nation to play as is beyond important as you have to decide about important factors such as what do you wan as a special unit and does it come to late for it to make a differrence in my game.  This game has solid graphics for the time it came out and very good music. 
As all other civ games it's a very good and fun strategy game where you can sink hours into with out even realizing.  
To sum up I would recommend this Civilization game for two reasons one its currently the cheapest on steam and it has to best combat strategy. The later game kind of abandon this part of the game. So if your looking for an empire building game and are interested in nothing else then conquering and destroying every other nation then this is the civ game for you.  If not I would recommend you look at the later civ games.",1595011403,1595011403,TRUE,1,0,0.523809552,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.66E+16,17,6,15305,83,14918,1601433284

The turn-based strategy games takes lots of consideration and moves at manageable pace (think family or work needs something right now, so you can temporarily stop or save and come back in an hour or the next day.  The AIs are good enough to be present unpredictable challenges and opportunities.  A great game to make you think about all the things that make a winning strategy or a sorrowful second place.

It is a great break from a FPS (first person shooter) game, or is it the FPS is a good break from the strategic thinker game?

It's easy to pick up, and absorbs your time as you race to expand your civilisation through a combination of growth and military conquest. Various civilisations provide different bonuses which cater to different play styles and strategies. For example, you can gain military bonuses to build large armies, scientific bonuses to facilitate technological advantages, commerce bonuses to offset whatever costs you decide to incur, as well as others.

You can customise the game such as map size and type, AI difficulty, types of victories and accelerated production for a quicker game. Note that large maps often end up taking a lot of time and turns become longer and longer as you manage large numbers of cities and units. Also on harder difficulties, rather than implementing optimum strategies, the AI receives bonuses and becomes ridiculously hard.

If you get bored of the standard random maps, you can load various scenarios that come with the game. There is even a quite comprehensive map editor which allows for custom maps and rules. You can create your own custom resources, units, techs, governments and civilisations. It's even possible with just the map editor to build cities on water.",1591939761,1591939761,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.66E+16,26,1,3460,0,3404,1595319924

Arguably the most important, if not the best, entry in the venerable Civilization series. While today Civilization 5 may be the definitive version of Civilization, Civilization III used to claim that spot, and is still very much worth revisiting today--especially if you're looking to play Civ on an older PC that might groan and creak under the strain of modern games.

Civilization III is incredibly polished and boasts an enormous amount of content, especially with regard to mods. The 2D visuals still look gorgeous today and a modern CPU can bruteforce its way through that usual murderer of Civilization playthroughs, the late-game slog. Be warned, however, that Civilization III is a very old game, and it shows its age. Mostly this manifests in the UI, which is considerably less intuitive and clear than we're accustomed to these days--and, perhaps most problematically for new players, there aren't any tooltips. If you've never played a Civilization game before, you're in for a steep learning curve. And if it's been a while since you've played Civilization III and you're looking to revisit an old favorite, well, unless your memory is much greater than mine, odds are you'll have a fair bit of a learning curve to muddle through as well. Who'd've thought the most important innovation in the 4x genre over the last 20 years would be something as simple as tooltips?

Well, anyway. It's Civilization III: one of the finest turn-based strategy games ever produced. In many respects it falls short of its successors, most notably the wildly imaginative expansions of Civilization IV and the perfectly polished systems and mechanics of Civilization V, but it remains an excellent title nonetheless.

The game, in its current condition, is severely bugged (but it is also specified in ""System Requirements"" section of Steam that the game is compatible with Win2000/XP only).

Second problem: The game's AI settings apparently have been changed greatly since when I was playing the basic version of it from a CD, many years ago. I distincly remember how the difficulty would scale in a reasonable manner as you went up in difficulty settings. Not anymore. Probably due to the influence of the modding community, which I suspect would be hardcore gamers, even at the easiest settings the AI is completely focused on spamming cities and units, without a thought for developing their cities. I remember playing around the hardest difficulty settings before. In this version, even at the easiest settings any other civilizations you play against gang up on you from the get go.

I was still greatly pleased with reading the many civilopedia entries and visiting the nice memories of the old appearance of the game. However, I believe it is a broken piece of software now. And considering that it is almost an ancient game today, and that it has had 3 more sequels so far, I don't think any improvements will take place.

I do not recommend this game in its current condition.",1587925370,1587925678,FALSE,2,0,0.482228637,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.66E+16,26,10,751,0,569,1588105814

However it's okay for them to walk on your territory. Then when you complain to them too much they declare war. Small map it's not so bad because you can keep up with defending.

 One complaint I might have is the balancing mechanics between AI and the Player. Unless you go aggressive expansionist, or seclude yourself from the rest of the AI, you will be dominated swiftly.

Or you play the newer titles and hear people refer to the old games and you want to find out for yourself what got so many people hooked on Civilization.  For either purpose I can fully recommend picking this game up. 

For a old game it is pretty stable for new systems and have even played multiplayer for the first time ever with this Steam version and it worked flawlessly. So at least for me with Windows 10 and a modified HP Pavilion from 2014 it works fine.

For some reason I think the graphics are a little better on this version then I remember from the disc version and this is a more complete edition so it has more Civs. But for those coming from Civ 5 or 6 and never played this game just beware that you are getting the old predecessor of your beloved title.

In terms of gameplay I enjoy this version the most out of all the Civilization titles. It's simple but doesn't lack depth at all. I feel like it holds your hand a little less and seems slower paced. However that may be because in 5 and 6 you have religion that you may want to rush to make and it feels less on rails as in 5 and 6 you pick Civ traits such as tradition, liberty, etc. Not to say those are bad but just different.

Shame it still lacks HD resolution support, just like it doesn't have actually ANY graphics settings - although when it got released in 2001 it didn't look bad compared to its age being an isometric 2D-game.

Pak znovu vložíme maso, přidáme koření, mírně podlijeme a dusíme v troubě. Maso poléváme šťávou a podle potřeby podléváme vývarem. Měkké maso vyjmeme, šťávu vydusíme na tuk, zaprášíme moukou, osmahneme a postupně ředíme zbytkem vývaru a smetanou.

Omáčku dochutíme cukrem, citronovou šťávou nebo octem a dobře povaříme. Potom omáčku prolisujeme přes cedník. Nalijeme ji na maso a ještě na plotně prohřejeme. Maso nakrájíme na plátky.

I've been playing on and off since it's release. I've learned a lot of history and English terminology through playing this game as a kid. The game play is not the best: the next games are superior game play wise. However they eliminated the endless combat that reigns over Civ 3. It is one of these games, uniquely so, that you can hoard military units, stack them up near the enemy's borders, declare war and take 5 cities, big or small, before the enemy gets his turn. Although a lot, A LOT, of micromanagement is required to pull off this kind of tactic, it is really rewarding if somewhat tedious. The technology system is fine, it's slower than later games, but you have more time to play between eras. Most unique units are well-designed. A lot of Wonders are broken (Statue of Zeus, cough cough) and can allow you to cut through early eras like a knife through butter. Early eliminations are common and wonder fights are exciting. 

The OST is BONKERS. I still listen to it, so many years later, even without playing. Jungle sounds, mesoamerican music etc. Really well orchestrated.

Overall, I've been enjoying this game for so many years. It's my childhood darling so I may be a bit far from objectively measuring its pros and cons.",1561921917,1561921917,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.66E+16,245,9,4081,96,3814,1601600252

6,Sid Meier's Civilization® III Complete,13964847,english,"I will start this review in two seperate forms, one for interested newcomers and then the Old Guard.

I will list off the pros first before the cons of this game, Civilization 3 is a different twist of the game than you may be familar with 4 and 5. Go in understanding this switch:
     -Its an old game, if you can run the actual game, there should be no real issues.
     -Graphically, it's a sound experience and not many real issues, the modding community can find you bug fixes or new skins. Its pleasing regardless and you won't really be let down by this game.
     -Combat is similar to Civ 4, simple dice combat where units have health bars going between 3-6, strength and defense stats play their parts and very simple to understand. There are Offensive Units, Defensive Units and Manovuer units, no exceptions and combat is based on these theorectical roles.
     -31 Civs that each have 1 unique unit, unless mods are involved. Civ bonuses are general in that they have two traits which give them bonuses which are shared by others, Militaristic, Religious, Industrists, etc.
     -Diplomacy is sound and reliable, techs can be traded directly as well as maps, I will list faults soon
     -Happiness is based per city, with simple factors involved including conscription
     -Civfanatics Community and its modding community are lovely and its still alive and well, just no Workshop

The Cons:
     -Civ 5 has a prediction based combat, units do no die with one attack on even matches. Not the case for this game, they fight till they die unless they are manovuer units against inf. Bullshit can and will happen, don't cry.
     -The AI Diplomacy is very defensive and almost always cautious, wary or spiteful towards you, no exceptions.
     -Its really easy to find yourself fighting half the world because of one war, tech trading is enabled so you can find yourself backwater as they maintain amiable relations and trade those tech with one another while they fight you. 
     -Multiplayer is old, the members are not exactly nub-friendly, I myself was 3 years old when this game came out.
     -Game doesn't work for you, you're fucked, not much anyone can do for you.
     -In my opinion, the hardest Civilization I have every played, it will humble you many times over.
In the end it is a Civ-game, you can't really go wrong with trying. It is the game that personally got me into Civilization and its unique-ness will likely find you some memorable gameplay. Hey and if you get the game and love it, I'd always be willing to play with you by e-mail or I might even try GameRanger. Good luck on your adventure To Stand The Test of Time

Returning Civ 3, should you get it on steam? Yes and no, while digital copies are nice, its not any different from the disk. That being said, I prefer it on Steam. I have purchased this game three times, one the authentic Civ III Gold Version, which was outstanding and I loved it. However, eventually I got a new computer and it turns out the disc was ruined. I got the game a third time over E-bay, the only source I could find which remains, this time the Complete. Features were missing and I couldn't even access them no matter what I tried, the conquest files corrupted and Play the World missing. I got a new computer, my current, running Windows 8.1, 4GB RAM and Integrated Graphics. The disc would not load the game, but viola, I found the steam version was the cheapest to begin with. Its the same game as you know, and for me everything was working well. Underneath I will discuss the major steam issues:
     -For me at least, Steam Overlay does not appear to work and I wouldn't know how to fix it, it could be a personal issue, I don't know. 
     -There are serious issues people have with getting this dinosaur game to work on new computers. Win 7 tends to have more compatiability issues with the game than Win 8(.1). Your at risk here, but this is usually the cheapest alternative
     -Modding is simple but remember, access the files through the properties tab by right-click the game in the Library Tab
     -Multiplayer is not run by Steam servers, nor GameSpy Arcade, it shut down if you haven't followed the game. It is now accessible over GameRanger.

it seems as well AI acts with perfect knowledge of map (which is nearly the only strong way to heavily cheat on this without some quadruple bonuses to everything, however all those are a thing on top difficulty i bet; and in those old civs you pretty sure are not winning in this absurd case)

it seems AI doesn't really try to unite against you in case of lead (though maybe does get furious at riches), yet is overly happy to try silly backstabs / 'surprise attacks' or else; it may even try to assault clearly later era stronghold with simple hordes that would almost never win there

oh and there's the quite massive downside in old civ - combat is literally random, so much that it matters almost endlessly, since there are massive terrain bonuses as well and ancient spearmen could very well beat tanks; it's not even a weird and rare case - hopelessly outdated AI hordes may just jump onto your mountains anytime and become unmovable force

there is a lot of inconvenience with units such as limits to upgrading, mostly no true way to skip tons of unit movements and such (maybe in case of railroads it becomes sort of that), while there are tons of units and often clumsy or limited control over them - and then 'same continent' is breaking minds of automated workers, there was a case where they literally rushed through many foreign borders and large lands that are hostile - to sometimes work on nearly or actually foreign volcano that recently exploded - and then instantly all die to yet another explosion, while they stand right on top of volcano

AIs for some reason barely ever wish to cooperate anyhow equally, even if it's them who often try to ally their weak nation to much more advanced one - even if it's exactly they who backstabbed you and awfully need protection now - of course it's you who always should pay army's worth of upkeep in protection treaty; then there's both positive and strange moment - bots can be (furious) at you yet still seriously try to ally and get protection

civ3 is somehow quite confusing and unintuitive i suppose, even when simultaneously tools available + core mechanics are ridiculously simple (but even pacing is very strange); it also seems to take massive time to playthrough even a bit - and without much management i guess (spammy) AI and all those older type mechanics can result in a quick death of civilization

it did have some nice ideas but the rest can simply create rather stupid spammy - defensive-favoring (and as well ruining that for YOU the player, because you lack any extra automation possible) grind, starting even from most ancient times where first of all units can be massed and rushed by population that generally anyone has and some do in massive surplus

overall civ3 has either too serious or too numerous problems to be offset by a few good moments; i'd say in practice it is easily nearly unplayable, inconvenient and quite mindless - while serious business going on against you won't let you be mindless one (or there you could lose on the easiest setting possible); it is possibly not even really challenging since maps feature very inhospitable lands (full of mountains not to even settle or ever grow anything) while as well rich and useful plains

so from the start it seems about all factors are against you; that's somewhat interesting but not for long (and that's a bit too much patience still)

since it is often not even easy to survive - some a bit casual or even a much later civ5 player will likely be plainly outspammed by ruthless AI if they miss about anything in proper setup and management (and when unfamiliar, there must be a lot to miss)",1544926196,1544926196,FALSE,6,1,0.38692224,6,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.66E+16,414,89,4578,0,2836,1554380053

Civ III lacks some of the sophisticated gameplay mechanics introduced in the later games and I consider the combat in particular to be a weaker point of this game, as it usually amounts to just mindlessly building more units than your opponents. Despite this, Civ III gets the job done simply and effectively, which is why I always come back to it over the other games in the series.

78,Sid Meier's Civilization® III Complete,45873444,english,"I absolutely hate this game. I've played Call to Power 1 and 2, Sid Meier's Civ 5, 6, and this. I see all these reviews about how this is still the best Civ game, and I just do not see what they're seeing. In Civ 5 and 6, the enemy AI will at least kill and absorb far weaker AI. They will at least every once in awhile do little pretend wars where they attack another equal AI's city (not take it, but just damage it ). The enemy AI in this game will always be permanently allied against you, even if you pick for them to be the least aggressive they can be (useless option). The combat is the most frustrating, rng-based, tedious, time-consuming, micro-managing ****fest I've ever seen. You can have many units occupy a tile, but they can only attack 1 at a time. You would think that means combat would at least be better than Civ 5 and 6, but like I said, the rng is so stupid that you have to make sure you have an advantage of 5x or more, unless you want to just load half the time and try the battle again, cuz you will fail half the time at a 2x advantage. And what I mean by that is this - You can have a unit with twice as much attack as they have defense, they can be wounded, sitting in a grassland/plain, not fortified, not across a river, and there's still a good chance you will lose if you attack him. In addition to that, you can NOT fully kill an enemy by bombarding. This means that you have to rely on rng attacking to actually kill any enemy military unit. Call to Power 2 sucks because you can't set up a scenario where the AI put up any threat (they won't attack you with anything more than a few units ever), and this game sucks for the opposite reason, because the AI only wants you dead and they have huge advantages even on low difficulties. It especially doesn't help that the maps spawn such few horses and iron (even though you NEED them to get anything past starting units in this game), seems to always put them near the AI and far away from you, and punishes you greatly if you build a town far away from your own (through waste/corruption penalties), in which, you would need to connect that town with a road in order to build those horse/iron units in your other towns. If you don't connect that town to your civilization, then like I said, the waste/corruption is so bad that you won't get to build ANYTHING in that town. The enemy AI also destroys your lonely roads in no time. I'm uninstalling this game and never considering it again.

4,Sid Meier's Civilization® III Complete,44639759,english,"This game is actually pretty good and a nice way to pass the time, but I don't understand why you can't have infinite turns to have that alternate earth timeline atmosphere that it takes place in your own version of Earth where your Civilisation can further go through its ups and downs with no sight of any kind of game victory in any horizon, but instead the best we can get is 1000 turns, which in my opinion is pretty displeasing since I was able to get a cultural victory with 1000 turns in just one go, on a small island surrounded by sea, in a very large map. I don't know if you CAN continue to run your civilization after a victory, because the 2 times I did get an endgame and went to click ""OK"", my game immediately freezes and stops working, making me have to quit the game.
Overall, it's a very fun game for you to pass the time, but it's going to be a quite the downer if you want to fully invest in your civilization for as long as you want (which would usually be ""forever and ever"" in some cases).

10,Sid Meier's Civilization® III Complete,43957050,english,"Sid Meier's Civilization III is a turn-based strategy game on where you can play as one of many nations/countries and play on various maps which would be the ""Earth"" for that map. This complete edition concludes of the base game, Civilization III, Civilization III Play the World & Civilization III Conquest. We have many scenarios in this game with examples of them being Rise of Rome, World War 2 Pacific and even Earth type maps which you can either have true starting locations as your desired nation or have the spawn randomized. 

PROS
- CIv 3 has the biggest maps out of any other Civ game.
- We have no limitations on units like we had on every sequel. Units can stack which gave a much more war feeling to the game.
- If you want a game to last at least a week or even a month. On this game you can make it happen.
- For an old game it still runs smoothly.
- Multiplayer still works, so you can play with friends and/or family.
- Gameplay is simple, but you can make mistakes easily and the enemy will take advantage of that 

CONS
- Dated graphics (can be a + or a -)

Overall
This is and always will be my favourite civ 3 game, the sequels are all about fancy graphics and less war. If you want to actually feel like you have a civilization then this is the game for you. If you want the ultimate experience, on an earth map and the biggest map you can dream of. Then pick this map. TETurkhan Test of Time. This comes with various game types that include of spawning with pre-made cities like earth is today with the available civilizations in the game, true location start which allows you to where your country's first capital was. Or have it randomized. So you could have England in India or the Japanese in Africa. This is the biggest map the game has to offer and with the size of it.

70,Sid Meier's Civilization® III Complete,40459087,english,"I've played Civ3, Civ4, Civ5, and Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri (also known as SMAC).  Civ3 and SMAC are still the best of these to me.  I wish Steam had the full version of SMAC, cuz I never was able to get the expansion pack for that one.

I got THIS version of Civ3 as part of a package deal.  I already had a CD-ROM of the original game and played that a lot.  I had plans to hunt down the expansion packs for it as well, but then Steam came into my life.

I compare playing Civ3 to a Poker tournament.  It's pretty easy to learn how to play, and hard to win in the long run.  Despite all the hours I've put into it, I've never won a game, even when I thought I was supposed to.  The point isn't to win, though; the point is to play.  Every time I've done that, I've learned something else.  I've also quit many games due to the fact that it was obvious I had been dealt a losing start.  Replay value approaches the infinite due to the sheer number of variables that go into a game, most of which are customizable, and some of which are procedurally generated (including the map, which will make or break you most times).

I was hoping that Civ4 and Civ5 would prove to be closer to this game and SMAC combined.  That turned out not to be the case.  Because of my love for this game and SMAC, I've found it difficult to enjoy 4 and 5 for what they offer.  They didn't feel like improvements on the formula, TBH.  I say that cuz, well, Civ3 is just that frickin' good.

For me, Civ3 is a fine, and also somewhat extreme, example of how gameplay is superior to graphics.  I can't say that pining for the days of sprites is in everyone's best interest; but sometimes, awesome polygonal renderings are just too much, or they wind up being more of a hindrance or distraction.  That said, Civ3 is not particulary known for its awesome sprites, either.  Still, you know what is what in this game.  Plenty of people made mods for the game as well.  I've seen Lord of the Rings mods, and one or two intended to improve how terrain features looked.  I never got into these, myself, although I do wish some things were easier to see due to design.

77,Sid Meier's Civilization® III Complete,40140618,english,"This game is a gem.. it delivers a unique atmosphere and enjoyment that no other civ managed to equal, not even civ 6. 

PROS
- Each era contains its unique soundtrack, and nore of them are as boring as the soundtracks of civ 5 and civ 6. 
- You want to conquer a city? Go for it, send in a ton of units and take it.. your offensive units vs your enemy's defensive units, no insane bonus for defending a city and no ridiculous penalties for capturing as many cities as you want (looking at you civ 5). 
- The fact that you can stack as many units as you want on a single stack was a vital mechanic that civ 5 should have never taken away.. it makes the game clunky and unnecessarily limitating.
- All units have 2 values, an offensive one and a defensive one, allowing for more complex strategies and making every units a lot more unique and specialized. 

CONS
The AI will be unforgiving and sooner or later, every single one of them will swarm you will armies aimed at ending you.. it can be very challenging for players who like to simply give up when things get difficult, because they will. They progress very quickly with science, just to make things even more difficult. For this reason, i strongly suggest new players to choose the easiest level of difficulty at first, or maybe the one after it for players who played a lot with other civs. 

CONCLUSION
Every mistakes that civ5's developpers made, the ones that we hoped were going to be fixed in civ 6.. well, this game will give you an experience of a vastly more satisfying and authentic civ game. after playing this game and enjoying it, you'll feel like civ5 took the wrong turn and civ6 will no longer be relevant to you.",1518825527,1518825527,TRUE,1,0,0.523809552,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.66E+16,171,1,5380,0,4562,1587299707

Now this cheat isn't impossible to beat, but the deadly troop stack will sooner or later spell doom for you and your civ. Only real way around this cheat is to get an island, stay isolated as long as possible, and then hold out.

Graphics are Good. Even though it came out in 2001.
Comes with Alot of maps and can be randomly generated too. Example (UK Map, World Map)
There is mods out for the game here is the link - https://www.civfanatics.com/civ3/downloads/
The price of the game is $5 which is pretty good asking price. 
There is an Editor so that you can create your own map or scenerio.

-Mixed (Depends on perspective.)
The turns are pretty long for me at late game if I play on Huge Map. It would take 30 seconds to minute to go through in later stages of the game.

When you download the game you have to manualy set the resolution in the files to 1080p  which would only take a minute. You can find a tutorial online.

The game is less complex compared to CIV 4 or CIV 5. For example you can't edit the details of your goverment like you can in CIV 4 and there is no religion system like civ 4.

Con-
Not really anything I can pinpoint right now.

59,Sid Meier's Civilization® III Complete,11287425,english,"This game is everything I want out of the Civilization series, even if a bit dated. The graphics have aged fairly well in my opinion, especially for a game from the very early 2000s. The old map-like aesthetic of the game's empire view is very nice, and the unit sprites are done very well for a game from a time with extremely limited graphical capabilities. One feature I especially love that I think shouldn't have been done away with in future Civilization games is the 'aerial view', which allows you to get an extremely detailed view of your cities.

However, even if the graphics are considered lackluster by some in this time, the soundtrack still holds up extremely well and is possibly the best soundtrack out of the entire Civilization series. From the piano-based melodies of the Medieval era to the jazzy guitar riffs of the Modern era, the soundtrack is extremely immersive and well-produced. Even some DLC scenarios have custom soundtracks, which are just as well-made as the soundtracks of the main game.

The gameplay is also well-done and it isn't too easy, nor is it too hard. The difficulty scaling in this game works well enough, and you are able to even change specifics such as AI aggressiveness, something that appears to be absent from later entries in the series. The advisors in this game are actually quite helpful and their associated menu screens allow you to easily get a detailed overview of your empire in order to best manage it. My only criticism of the more domestic side of gameplay is the way corruption works in this game; it tends to be quite rampant (especially on larger maps, and ESPECIALLY in the later stages of the game) although it can be reduced with wonders such as the Forbidden Palace and buildings such as courthouses.

Combat in this game is based off of an RNG system that works fairly well, although there is the occasional absolutely ludicrous outcome where a spearman will manage to defeat a tank. Unit promotions in this game work on four levels: conscript (the starting level for conscripted units as well as units gifted by villages), regular (the starting level for built units), veteran, and elite. Each promotion grants an extra bar of health. While much more simple than the extensive promotions in games such as Civilization 5, this system still works quite well as Civilization 3 tends to focus much more on wider-scale combat and empire management than single-unit powerhouses.

Overall, Civilization 3 is an excellent -- albeit, somewhat dated -- entry into the Civilization series. I'd probably give up both of my legs to see a remastering of this game.",1405599357,1508618705,TRUE,4,0,0.559902191,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.66E+16,75,7,11256,0,10656,1585796480

70,Sid Meier's Civilization® III Complete,35482403,english,"My favorite Civilization title of all time. This game may be old, but I find it's graphics are just right for the genre and it does not have the cartoony look that some later titles are sometimes guilty of. Being an older title, the AI isn't always the smartest and will struggle to perform certain tasks like sea-based invasions. A huge problem with this game is its infamous RNG which has led to powerful units being killed by weaker unit (i.e. spearman kills tank). However, just play without ""preserve random seed"" enabled and you can just save before each battle and reload quickly to get a better result if you feel you have been cheated. Other features missing include advanced diplomacy beyond war and trade and revolutions occuring in pre-established empires (a feature lacking from most unmodded Civ titles).

The thing that makes this game my favorite Civ is the availablity of mods to customize this game to your heart's content. You can play out just about any scenario you can think of. Although a lot of files were lost when civfanatics changed a while back, there is still plenty of diverse content available. I would highly recommend the WorldWide mod for anyone looking for a much expanded version of the game. Whether you want to make small changes like add in one or two units or a custom civ, or install total conversions and scenarios, the tutorials online make it very easy to add such things in.

I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys Civilization and other empire-building RTS games.


I have logged hundreds of hours on the disk version. The steam version makes it easy for me to carry this game wherever I go without having to bring disks. The only difference (and problem) I have found between the disk and Steam versions is Steam removed a lot of accesory files from the game's files, such as .exe's for vanilla Civ3 and Civ3PTW expansion.

It is a masterpiece that stands the test of time. It is more realistic and fun with huge maps. No religion, but best Nuclear Weapons, artillery mechanic, interface is great for me and Civilopedia is the best out of all Civilizations for me. Clear and Plain to understand.
Easy game to play, yet it is harder to master.
Advisors and Leaders change clothes, depending on which era it is. Interface is more ""realistic"" looking and not too cartonish as the newer ones. Music is outstanding.
A lot is early on about how much you expand, but it is also much easier to get steam rolled by opponents if your cities are not defended. Sometimes less better cities is more productive and efficient. Maps play a big role, and the map editor is amazing.
Diplomacy I found the most realistic of all. World war scenario can happen very quick with mutual protections. 
Never attack anyone however with open borders, they will hate you pretty much forever, lol.
If you are not the leading in technology you can still sell them to the one that have none. If you have a technology noone has, sell it to everyone (Like worldmaps) in the same turn. Extra money is great.
Governments are a very good mechanic too. Made no sense to me Civilization IV Police State with free speech.

I've bought this game exactly 4 times for myself. The first copy wandered off to a friend who never got around to returning it and after a while I realized I missed it too much as I walked past the""Gold"" CD version that was on sale at my local Frys which was promptly purchased. On to copy number 2, Yay! I've played that for a good long time on both Windows and Linux but finally got tired of slapping in the CD every time I wanted to play for its antiquated copy protection. Along came a Steam sale and I said 'Hello' to copy number 3. This version is slightly different than my ""Gold"" version (d*mn volcanoes) but still enjoyable as ever. Finally, just like clockwork, right after I bought #3 ran across another sale on that other game site that doesnt have any silly DRM on it in the first place and I was the proud owner of copy number 4.

KeepRes=1
to its own line in your ini file ""./Civilization III Complete/Conquests/conquests.ini"" to get proper widescreen support (non 4:3 aspect).

Depending on the version you have, this might be somewhere else too....perhaps one more directory down at ""./Civilization III Complete/Conquests/Conquests/conquests.ini""

For Linux, see WineHQ for more info on how to get the ""squaking"" bird sound to stop once it starts. The quick fix is to turn off those sounds in options but slightly less enjoyable as it removes all the environment sounds.

I guess in attempt to make the map look more realistic shape of the land is blurred so much, that it's hard to see where it actually ends. The result is quite opposite than desired, and you can't easily tell what kind of terrain is there, what would the city be covering exactly, etc. Horrible! Mountains look artificial as hell, as well ;) or, no - most of the map looks artificial and flat.
Had to play with the grid visible most of the time, otherwise couldn't see shit. Didn't get used to the grid so switched it off from time to time... and again couldn't see crap.

Other than that, it is quite good Civ game and feels like much refined C2. I liked the concept of visible and expanding borders, rather disliked the idea of culture as a winning factor (yeah right, like this could happen in this dimension), loved the concept of strategic resources and linking cities by roads/harbors/airport to use them. C3 has a good ""just one more turn"" factor too... but too bad you can't see shit most of the time.

Yes I know there are many more sequels, but from civ 4 onwards, the game begins to turn into a strategy game of sorts. It is Civ 1-3 that TRULY give you the feeling of an emperor over a fledling empire. 

This game is not to be missed out on if you are a fan of the Civilization franchize, especially if you want to go back to one of the classics. Civ 5 & 6 are really good in my opinion, but Civ 3 REALLY TRULY steals the show.

80,Sid Meier's Civilization® III Complete,30125752,english,"Originally I had some crashes with this game version (Steam), but managed to fix it. The info is at the end of the review. Civilization III Complete was one of the games I spent the most time with, and really enjoyed it. For me, it's easily one of the best 4X games ever made (at least in the time I type it).

If you did not play Civilization 3 in the past and are wondering if you should buy it - below is some basic info that should encourage you to do that.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
The pluses:

+ Lots of civilizations, each plays differently

+ Lots of different units + special military unit for each civilization

+ The AI scripts are demanding (unlike in most modern games)

+ Resources on map force you to play strategically

+ Depending on the size and type of the maps, games might differ quite a lot

+ You can play in really big maps

+ The game has fine mods that you can find on the internet

+ It's hard to stop playing it

------------------------------------------------------
The minuses:
- It's hard to stop playing it

- At higher difficulties the military victory is the most viable option (only)

- When you control most of the map it's just boring killing of the remaining weaklings

- At the industrial age, you probably control most of the map

- At higher difficulties AI is cheating

- Civilizations are not balanced (some are really good, some - really bad)

- After you learn to use workers and diplomacy, it's not that hard (but still fun)

- Old 2D game, so in native desktop resolution units and fonts might be too small

- Old 2D game, so in native game resolution units might be too big (and no widescreen)

======================================

For native desktop resolution in game:

1. Go to the Conquests folder in your Civ 3 folder conquests.ini
2. Put ""keepRes=1"" in conquests.ini file (without """")

======================================

Those settings should fix crashes in Windows 7 64 bit.

1. Go to the Conquests folder in your Civ 3 folder
2. Rename LSANS.FOT to -LSANS.FOT

If that does not help:
Set Windows compatibility to Windows XP Service Pack 2 and run program as administrator.

If the game runs too slow delete keepRes=1 from ini file (in Windows XP mode the game is slower)

======================================

That's it. You can now go buy the game.",1487879039,1487879039,TRUE,16,0,0.725341558,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.66E+16,111,9,502,0,502,1487875818

33,Sid Meier's Civilization® III Complete,28199211,english,"So first off I'm going to start by saying even though it might show about an hour or so of playtime it does not mean I have not played this game before. I first came across this game at GameStop and I really hadn't played any games since I was young. But I needed a past time because I was dying of boredom being at home laid up in bed unable to do much. I had severely injured my back and I wasn't going to work anytime soon and the depression started to kick in. So anyways by now the game had been out for about 3 years and it looked interesting so I bought it. Went home and started playing it and it was my first time playing a strategy game so I didn't even know if I was going to like it. I started playing around lunch time by the time I know it was dinner time so took 10 minutes got my food and came back and ate while I played. By the time I knew it was freaking 6am the next day! I had never had lost track of time by that much, but man was I enjoying the game. I thought the graphics were pretty decent, the game play was very good and the UI was also good. Of course it was the first time I've had played a game with an in game Civilopedia and I thought that was awesome. The other thing I miss from Civilization III that has not been added to any other Civilization since is building your capital building when your citizens were happy you were able to add one section at a time until you finished upgrading your building. I thought that was fun, even though it was a very simple and quick thing. By the time Civilization IV came out I had around 3500 hours invested in this game and I still have the original disk I bought, but I went ahead and bought it on Steam because they had a very good deal on Civ III, IV and Colonization which I already have the other two also. But I want to keep those disks from getting any damage and besides Steam keeps a running track of your gaming time. So I can safely say this game is what got me back into gaming and becoming a full time gamer. I DO RECOMMEND THIS GAME, EVEN THOUGH IT'S AN OLDER GAME.

37,Sid Meier's Civilization® III Complete,28086470,english,"All right. I got this game from a friend sometime around 2012, I think. I played it for a bit but honestly, I had trouble getting into it. A lot had changed from Civilization II and I never really caught on to all the differences.

Picked it up during the Steam Black Friday sale on Thanksgiving. I gave it a whirl. At first, I had the same feelings I did last time I played all those years ago. It wasn't CivII, and the strategies that worked for me then were failing me now. It didn't help that there wasn't a tutorial or a manual of any kind, and the Civilopedia is not the most user-friendly interface, although it's critical to understanding all of the game mechanics the AI employs.

I played on Chieftain for a while, just trying to get a handle on the game mechanics, but now I'm bored of chieftain. Too easy. Once you learn and begin to understand the game mechanics, this is a pretty great game. That said, it's virtually impossible to win if you don't constantly expand and build one city after another. I mean, that is all you will do. Build and build and build. If you don't, the AI will and you'll lose. Pretty much the only way to win is to begin building a ton of cities in the early parts of the game.

I did like the implementation of cultural borders, and how borders clash against one another. The cultural conversion tool was also pretty cool, where cities could rebel and join your forces because they realized that their own culture was lifeless. So it's a pretty good game, and definitely worth the price for my 46 hours (and growing).

I do have to say, though, that a couple of the leader choices are really dumb. Mahatma Gandhi was not a leader of the Indian nation. Although he championed the move for India's independence, making him the face of India is weird, because he was a guru and not a general. And Jeanne d'Arc leading the French? She was a teenager and a peasant who, by her own confession, never even used her sword in combat. They could have chosen Charlemagne or Napoleon Bonaparte, but Joan!

39,Sid Meier's Civilization® III Complete,28074689,english,"Still as good of a game as I remember it from my childhood, it's age shows a little, but for $5 (and potentially even less) it still provides that ""one more turn"" mentality. I probably sunk at least 200 hours into my local libraries copy, so when I saw it was on steam, it was a no brainer purchase.

Having played Civ 5, I have to say that the portraits of the rulers convey far more emotion, at least in my eyes, than the full set pieces of Civ 5. The barbarians have multiple AI options and can be absolutly brutal. Certain civilzations have certain traits which affect what actions trigger golden ages. You get to upgrade your palace in a way that actually changes the way it looks on the city screen. Also there is a city screen where you get a detailed overview of your city and all the wonders you built. As opposed to Civ 5's jam packed 3D model of your city.

Age helps, in a way, since with todays operating systems the turns are lightning fast, even with troop movement.

I know I have my nostagia blinders on, but I really like this game, despite whatever flaws I cannot see. I suspect that anyone who likes these kinds of games and doesn't mind the lack of 4k graphics, will definitely get their money's worth.

95,Sid Meier's Civilization® III Complete,26610151,english,"Sid Meier’s Civilization III is a 4x strategy game, that means the objective of the game is to eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, and eXterminate to win. First off, the game takes some time to get the hang of the concept, but it also just takes time to play. A game could last anywhere from 30 minutes to multiple years. I first read the manual for the game which did help out. It told me of keyboard shortcuts that I never actually used. It also explained to me the basics of the game so when I started my new game I wasn’t completely lost. (This is coming from somebody who hasn't played any strategy games.) The first 30 minutes of my first game I wasted my turns walking around then finally building a city. I played as the Iroquois, they are proficient in agriculture, though I started producing warriors and getting very aggressive. My neighbors killed me and within an hour my first game was over. My second game ended much quicker, within 30 minutes my tiny city was captured. I felt very lost within the first turns of my first game. I felt the game didn’t do a very good job explaining what to do. I just felt a desire to discover the dark parts of the map because it didn’t look very good to me. However, I did find the advisors that would pop up and tell me information that I found very useful and helpful. In this way the game was able to help me assimilate myself with it’s complicated mechanics. 
One interesting mechanic in the 4x strategy game is its robust diplomacy system. There are many treaties, alliances, trade opportunities, agreements to be made, and wars to be waged. On my current playthrough I am a militaristic expansionist Roman empire I encountered the Aztecs and began fighting a war with them.  Upon seeing the I could overthrow them the Aztecs asked for a peace treaty which I agreed to. From there on out the Aztec and I created a rite of passage where we would be able to cross each other's land. However, I plan on expanding cities and surrounding them then I will take over their cities and kill them. This diplomacy system is a major part of my strategy to win the game. This will play a consequential role of my playthrough of this game. 
In general I have never been a big fan of strategy games, however I did find myself enjoying this game to a certain extent. I don’t expect to be putting too much time into the game anymore, but I can say that my time spent with it has not been all negative.",1479182609,1479182609,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.66E+16,295,15,188,0,188,1479177223

In all seriousness, this is a great game. It is 100% worth the $1.24 you pay when it goes on sale! It is very easy to manage your cities' happiness and production! With Civ III, you can que production items, unlike Civ V, which makes the game enjoyable. As well as allows you to have very productive cities. The way it makes that aspect of the game more enjoyable is that you don't have to click on the choose production icon every few turns. However, it sometimes likes to just switch to needless outdated military units after it runs out of production items in a que. Another nice feature of this game is the selecting how you want your game to be set up. It allows you to choose how old the earth is when you start the game. As well as has a few more features that are absent in Civ 5.

The only cons to this are the aforementioned AI, and playing it on a newer computer. The AI are typically kind of crazy when it comes to deals, and get really annoyed if you decline them. Which typically leads to war with them eventually. I seem to have a problem where the AI all declare war with me. Also, the AI expand their civilizations really fast, so if you buy this, make sure to settle as many cities as possible in the beginning of the game! Although that really applies to any Civ Game.

42,Sid Meier's Civilization® III Complete,24662931,english,"Here's what I think of this game, I'll compare it to Civ 5 since most people consider that to be the best Civ game.

Music: Both Civ 5 and Civ III have fantastic soundtracks as with pretty much all Civ games. CIV 5's soundtrack is better, but that doesn't mean this soundtrack isn't worth listening to. 

Diplomacy: The diplomacy here in Civ III, in my opinion is better. You can trade maps technologies, change how agressive the AI is. The AI does get quite a bit agressive once you get to medium agressiveness although.

Scenarios: The scenarios here in Civ III are quite interesting. We have Rise of Rome, Fall of Rome, Napoleanic Europe, WW2 in the pacific, etc. I honestly can't choose between Civ 5 and 3 in terms of which had better scenarios.

War: And here is where we start to see the flaws of Civ III. There are certain units made for attacking, defending, and seige units. The seige units must be protected otherwise they will be either captured or destroyed immediately, and the attacking units are vulnerable to counterattack. Defending units ensure your cities are protected and your attacking armies. This part of war, I liked, It made sure I don't just build completely one type of unit. 
Cities are instantly captured if there is no unit inside. I wasn't as fond of this as the unit diversity, but it was tolerable at least.
But then their's the battle system. It's luck based, which I have a burning hatred for. I could attack a spearman one time with an archer and not take any damage, while another time, a defending spearmen exactly the same as the other one could take out my archer, without taking any damage. How does that make any sense? I get it it's an old game an all, but come on.
Also the AI seem way too powerful. I met Scandinavia on turn 2 and it already said his forces outnumbered mine.

CIv 5 definetly, has better war mechanics.

Barbarian encampment and ruins/friendly encampments: Whether you love 'em or hat 'em these guys are around, some encampment are friendly and will give you something like gold or a settler to give you a huge early game boost. and of course the hostile. You can make the hostile encampments non existant, sedentary, normal, roaming or raging. Since there is more option than Civ 5, I'd say these are slightly better.

Civilization balance: Civilization 5 isn't exactly balanced, (Babylon is much better, is pretty much better every aspect compared to let's say the Iroqouis). Civ's are more balanced here. Each Civ have a unique unit, 2 free technologies and 2 bonus'. Military bonus' allow you to build stronger armies faster, science allows you to build science buildings faster, religious allows you to build cultural building faster, etc. In my opinion the two best are science and religious (Which Babylon ironically has both XD). Besides that Civ's are quite balanced besides early game Unique units (I'm looking at you bowmen)

Victory types: Time victory is always on here, which I don't like (although you can push back the counter for time victory to kick in) cultural victoy revolves around how much culture you can get in either one city or your entire empire, dominatuion requires you to own at certain percentage of the world's population or land area, conquest is to eliminate all rival civilizations., wonder is to build a certain amount of wonders, diplomatic is to get people to vote for you once the UN is built, and space race to leave this filthy planet. All good, although most of the time you will win by either cultural or time.

Graphic: I don't really care for graphics much, but the graphic here are at best, pleasing to the eye and at worst, tolerable.

Conclusion: CIV 5 is obviously better, but Civ 3 is extremely enjoyable also, I have many hours into this, and many more will be put into playing this. I know the flaws I listed here aren't going to be changed unless everyone at Firaxis gets high. I haven't seen any bugs, just a great game.

[b]PROS: [/b]On Mar 16, this game received a much-needed update to get rid of the nonfunctioning Gamespy multiplayer! Ugh, what a relief! This is my favorite installment of the Civ series. The game has a slew of nice preferences to choose from, even including an aid for the color blind.

[b]CONS: [/b] New to the game? Go into the options and turn the tutorial on. It's starts as off, for some reason. The cutscenes look horrible because of age and stretching. Resolutions are rough. Compared to modern installments, the opponent civs act rather erratically, to the point of being nonsensical. There is no balancing, so some Civs are OP and others you would ideally never play.

[b]WORTH: [/b]This is my favorite installment of the series, of course I think it's worth full-price. You may want to consider a discount though, if you're used to later installments. To the average player that lacks nostalgia, this is just the game you know and love but with less features.

[b][u]OVERALL:[/u] [/b] It's very easy to lose track of time with this game. It's great fun and I'd recommend it to anybody looking for a good ""board game"" style game on Steam, since there aren't many. It's certainly more simple than four or five, but has been my favorite installment of the series.

87,Sid Meier's Civilization® III Complete,23118807,english,"The series ended here, as far as I'm concerned. Now, Civ 4 was a good game, and while the less that is said about Civ 5 the better (if you ask me), in my mind Civ 3 was the epitome of the Sid Meier vision for the series and the greatest achievement of aesthetics, style, pacing and general gameplay - as far as Civ gameplay could go.

I think this has a lot to do with the predecessors. Civilization: Call to Power was an epic computer game, surpassing and extremely entertaining. Alpha Centauri was of course one of the very greatest titles the genre has ever seen, encorporating gameplay additions and features - so much recorded voice acting~ - that still feel fresh and ingenious to this day. It was into this setting of established 2D, top down turn based strategy excellence that Civ 3 had to plonk, and what a plonk it was.

How did it work so well? Well it was the way the game juxtaposed itself against it's lineage as much as the way it reproduced and refined it that really rung true with me. Civilzation 3 was all about resolution, refinement, aesthetics and staid excellence. The pacific colours, the fantastic drawn visions of your cities, the subtly faux-3D border markers, the movements of the characters, sounds and the pacing of the game were all just totally lovely touches that made this experience feel high quality and timeless.

Playing it today reveals a game that is completely succesful as a final installment in a series, even though the series itself continued on into the age of 3D. There are flaws of course - in end game especially the dominated maps completely cede any kind of influence over gameplay to your railways, aircraft and ICBMs, the voice acting of Alpha Centauri would have been really great here (it was used for Civ 4, famously, with Leonard Nimoy granting that game degrees of cultural magic that few computer games enjoy) and one could say that consequently the gameplay gets a bit stale towards the later stages of a long game, but it is what happens in the interim - especially the first three quarters of the span of civilization you navigate - that is a really wonderful experience, worth any price.

Definitely worth the buy ($1.37 on sale). Not having the culture group stuff from civ 5 makes the game alot better. Another up compared to civ 5 is that it doesnt have the fancy graphics, so I can run it on my work laptop (which has no dedicated gpu) [civ 5 to go? lel].

I find the whole idea of *clicking on my temple to add an upgrade (all visual?)* pretty pointless and dumb. I literally just hover my touchpad over the whole screen till i hear a sound, then click and escape. It was pretty annoying to 

The time it takes to finish a game is both a pro and con. If you are a time sensitive person I would suggest you turn off move animations for all units because you will leterally have your eye pop out waiting for allt he units to move at the end. Some of the other default settings also made the game annoying to play. In particular, if you have units which are fortified or in alert stances, the turn may very well pass away under the default setting unless you do some annoying repetitive camerfa movement. There was a setting to wait at the end of ever turn to make this easier, I'm totally fine hitting space bar or enter at the end of every turn then watch things happen in a way i didn't want it.

He has no interest in 4, 5, BE or anything like that. Says they're not interesting like this one is. I'm inclined to agree. I think that Civ 3 is the essence of 4X, and that any designer wanting to know what makes 4x games great,  should play this obsessively. There are a few things here and there that I think could have been expanded on- such as plague- and the fact that some civilizations simply have uninspired Unique Units with bland mechanics.

I really wish they didn't stray from the feel of the first 3 Civ games, I'm really not a fan of the feel of Civ 5, but alas the masses seem to disagree with me. 

I don't want the bland interface of the fourth and fifth games, I want character, and my loyal advisors to guide me.

I don't want to set my political civic 'Police State' and my economic civic to 'Central Planning'; I don't want to take whatever 'social policy' tree (with permanent effects + no drawbacks) or adopt the 'Order' ideology.
I want to use the 'Communism' government and have my advisors refer to me as 'Comrade' as I free to the proletariat of the world from the bourgeosie and the 'Fascist' Aztecs!

The character of the game, the way events and history play out, managing your empire and waging war, etc. is simply really something and it really seems to have been lost with the new Civ games. And the sad thing is, it has so much potential for future games with more fleshed-out content, features, etc.

When I was a child, I played this on and off constantly and never figuring out what I was doing. I played Diablo 2 around the same time and also didn't know what I was doing. 

This complicated empire micromanaging game is an old classic that many people remember, be it from watching one of your relatives playing or being that relative playing. You must manage large armies and cities while trying to expand your kingdom across the world. Disease, famine, civil unrest and poverty are just some of the factors you will have to deal with with trying to be the greatest empire. Doing things all the time is what will get you ahead, and failing over and over learning what does and doesn't work is the tutorial. Hardcore RTS is defined by the Civilization franchise.

I never really understood this game and I still don't. I never really enjoyed micromanage games as they posed too much stress for me to correctly enjoy them. This is personal and won't sway the game itself. 

This game is for people who love watching massive amounts of action going on at the same time with rediculous difficulty options and really good customization for world generation. For being this old, it holds its complication and difficulty really well. If you love this kind of stuff, then it's a no brainer and if you have never heard of this or just faintly remember it from long ago, make sure you Youtube some videos to make sure its your type of game.

It's not my kinda game, but it might be yours.

57,Sid Meier's Civilization® III Complete,20289030,english,"So many many many years ago I played the first CIV game. I loved it. Barely understood it as I was too young but I loved it. Lost the game at some point and didn't play the other CIV games until I bought CIV4 during a Steam sale. While the graphics improved a lot from the first game I did not enjoy the game as much. It was rather simple and straight forward. So now during another sale I decided to buy CIV3 as a lot of people are saying it's the  best version. A few hours in and I have to say I like this one better then 4. The game is a bit more challenging even on easy mode and I am just having a fun time creating my own civilizations. That however doesn't mean there aren't any downsides. Some things do not make sense like older units being stronger then newer units. Then there is the little glitch that you will constantly be aware of and that is that it looks like the game is freezing at the end of every turn. It just freezes for a few seconds and then continues but it is a bit of a pain. So far I have no had it shut down on me completely like I am reading in other peoples reviews but who knows it might just happen at some point. Honestly for the money I paid for it I won't complain much. It would have cost me more to get the cd version though I wouldn't have the glitch. My opinion? Totally worth playing and if you don't mind waiting a few seconds at the end of every turn get the steam version. If you do then buy the cd version. Have a lot of fun with it! 

P.S. having the chance to build your own castle is something I missed in CIV 4 glad to see it in CIV 3 :)",1451909923,1451909923,TRUE,2,0,0.502937198,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.66E+16,88,11,925,0,925,1452112337

66,Sid Meier's Civilization® III Complete,20007861,english,"This is the first Civilization game that I have ever played. And I have nothing but pleasant memories about it.

It includes all the basic mechanics that define a Civ game. But it hasn't aged very well. The interface is archaic and it's all 2D (except for leader animations). Not that it matters much for a strategy game, but still. 

Civ4 and Civ5 have much more to offer, so it's probably worth playing Civ3 only for nostalgic value. Although, I miss palace customisation and City View with wonders in the later games. Another cool feature is that the leader appearance and title change with each next era

Anyway, if you can get over occasional crashes, you will still spend hours building your empire, but, as I've said, with newer version on the market, Civ3 is mostly for veterans and those who'd like a more challenging game than Civ5.

However, most gamers here use PCs powered by 32 gigs of ram and NVIDIA's latest graphics card which requires the heat of the sun to forge properly, so it might run better on your Windows 7 or 8 computer.

The game itself was a staple in my childhood.  I had many hours of fun with it, even though I sucked at it as a kid.  Now, I can lay out a strategy, and retaliate easily when the enemy declares war.

The game itself has quite a bit going on.  You have to balance your gold economy, which can be a challenge as you progress in scientific research, military power, and additions to your city.  You have to make use of the terrain around you, which itself can be a gamble.  You might get everything you need under one generated map, and then get completely fucked by another generated map.  There is a lot to cover, most of which I'll leave you to see for yourself.

While not deep, this 4x experience is very refined, you really do have to play exactly to your Civ's strengths if you want any hope to succeed in the higher difficulties- there is no real catch all method. People may have complained about bombardment and bombers being Op since they can straight up kill units but I find this adds a lot more tactical complexity to war, especially in the mid Ind. age where it really reflects how much warfare at that time was based around defensive positions.

The campaigns within are straight up the best of any vanilla Civ game, Rise of Rome, the Middle Ages and the Age of Discovery are excellent, and hell the Pacific Theatre almost could've been its own game!

Finally, it may be a personal thing, but I've always preferred the isometic display here to the 3d graphics of 4, 5 and Beyond.

And as a small side note, because of how cheap this game is now it can be an effective litmus test to see if you'll even enjoy Civ games, so there's that.",1450123090,1450123090,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.66E+16,85,3,8822,0,7966,1568261610

6,Sid Meier's Civilization® III Complete,18523670,english,"Bought this originally when PC games came out in those big square boxes, and to be fair it does show its age. The graphics aren't enivable at all because, well, it is nearly 14 years old. It crashes sometimes too. There is quite a learning curve, but after a while you do get through it. The AI is random or too predictable at times, if they plop a stack randomly into your territory and refuse to leave, they're 90% going to declare war. Playing on easier levels, outsmarting the AI is fairly formulaic, aggressive expansion for the first half, strategically stealing all resources and then ploughing through them all. Small maps are too small, and if you create a massive map (which you can do in the editor, which itself has a learning curve) there is a city limit of 450. The game reaches its limit, but by that point each turn is so long, why bother. Naval conflict is always a bit piddly too. 

But really the base game has a simple enough format that its almost like a PC version of Monopoly. You can play it again and again, no fancy 3D experience or anything, the graphics really don't impede gameplay. 14 years later its still perfectly playable and, importantly, provides a fun and varied experience. Each game comes out wildly different from the last one, and every time you play a new challenge will arise. The randomized earths created offer nearly infinite variety and eliminate any boredom you could experience with similar games. I can easily play this game for hours and hours. Similar to Paradox games, once you start a campaign its hard to finish, there is enough variety in maps you always want to do something else. Games can easily go far into the future, and with some mods you can add some variety onto the existing game's timeline.

24,Sid Meier's Civilization® III Complete,71650,english,"Building on the classic Civilization II, Civ III introduces several new game mechanics including expanding City borders & also for the first time animated units. The player starts off in the year 4000 BC with a small group of settlers and some basic knowledge of road building, irrigation & farming. After choosing the site of their first City the player then has to explore and expand their empire to other locations. The ideal placement of a City would be close to natural resources & luxuries, this will help increase trade, production & happiness of the citizens. Connecting City's via roads also increases trade and the sharing of resources / luxuries across your empire. During the early game roaming Barbarians may cause problems along your borders and any unprotected units or land will be either captured or pillaged. As you progress through the centuries you will eventually meet other Civilizations. Some of these will be friendly and willing to trade, others more hostile and may attack you completely unprovoked. You have the opportunity to influence the opinions of other empires by your actions towards them, giving them gifts or trading technology is usually a way to get on their good side. Later in the game you can also forge an alliance with certain empires in the form of a mutual protection pact. This is especially useful during times of War to help seal victory over your enemies. The game ends in one of six ways, the most traditional being conquest (destroying all opponents). The Space race victory occurs when any Civilization completes and launches a Space Ship to Alpha Centauri. Other victory types are Cultural, Diplomatic & Domination. If the game ends and no one is victorious by any of these, the game uses a ""histograph"" to determine the winner by points.

This is one of my all time favourite games, though Civ IV has more depth by adding religion, unit promotions and other special abilities. I still prefer this version to any other.

71,Sid Meier's Civilization® III Complete,16709489,english,"From the very beginning, every mainline edition of the Civilization series has gotten an average of a 90-95% user approval rate which is a greater approval rate than that normally ascribed to civilization itself. This could be due to the fact that the Civilization seies simply soars while civilization itself seems to soar and stink in equal measure. Then again, it could be that the game of Civilization simply appeals to the inner narcissist lurking somewhere within us all. After all, how often is it you can be elected ruler of your nation by popular acclaim, rule them in a governmental form of your choice, eventually rise to rule to world, establish Earth's first off world colony, and live for centuries. I have to admit that is slightly more ambitious than my own real world expectations, but I do have an eye on the North American continent. Consider yourself warned.

Now don't get me wrong here. I am not trying to say that Civilization is the best turn based, civ building, strategy game ever. That would be unfair to all those games I have not gotten around to trying. What I can say is that it is by far the best I have ever played, and narcissist that I am, I will try most anything that gives me a shot at world domination.

The Civilization series is up to Civ-5 at this point, but Civ-3 is a game which endures the times, remains comparable to like games of more recent production, and holds a special place in my heart when compared to the newer versions of this long running classic. Later editions of this game introduce elements which alter the play style and base strategy of the game, but while I believe that Civ-4 & 5 remain true to the original construct to a large degree, it is Civ-3 which most closely  resembles the original. In fact, it is exactly like the original, but with greater user options, and smoother game play. 

If you have been thinking about giving this series a try, Civ-3 is a great place to start. With the release of Civ-5, the Steam price for Civ-3 is a mere $5.00 which in my opinion makes it one of the best bargains in the entire Steam Library.

77,Sid Meier's Civilization® III Complete,13918681,english,"General - 8.0
Sid Meier's Civilization is one of the greatest game franchises ever, it's a landmark for every turn-based strategy game. The name itself tells what the game is about, you pick one civilization, select a location to start, select CPU controlled civilizations and settings for that specific map. Your job is to make your civilization meet any of the victory conditions, which can be through science, military, culture, diplomacy, points, etc. The first game of the series I played was Civ II, back in 2001, which instantly made me a fan since then. However I skipped Civ III at its time, and that is what made me buy it many years later. I paid around 1USD for the game just to see what I missed, and unfortunately, not much. Don't get me wrong, it's a great game, but if you played Civ IV, in my opinion, there is nothing in Civ III that will be better than in the later game. It's only worth playing for saudosism purposes. It's heavily outdated.

Content - 8.5
Steam version is a complete version, which includes both expansion packs released. You have a vast number of civilizations to pick and you can adjust some major settings for a location, like temperature, umidity, geological era, water level, etc. You can also chose the victory conditions for a game, which you can fit into your play style, along with difficulty level. The Civilopedia is a tool of great educational value, it contains real data about the civilizations, technologies, unities and almost everything you can find in the game. There is a highest scores table too, but I believe it only displays single-player scores. I don't know if steam is providing some sort of multiplayer support at this time.

Gameplay - 4.0
Like most Civ games, you start with a settler, a worker and/or a warrior in most cases, from this you have to build your city and administer it's growth with the resources gathered around it, which can be selected in the city radius. Each unity you create in a city has a better use, and through the years (turns), as long as your cities and citizens are productive you'll eventually discover technologies which improve your unities and your cities buildings. You can focus your whole civilization in a few aspects or diversify your knowledge. Every civilization on the map have it's own personality and choices, from warmongers to pacifists. What you have to do is to secure your civilization a place in history. But why I give 4.0? It won't help you get started at all. I'm not asking for a strategy guide, I just wanna learn the basics of the game, what's unique to it, what options I have and what they do. I couldn't find a tutorial or at least a checkbox to display tooltips, even the options in the main menu don't have a basic description. It's one of the less intuitive game I've ever seen, unlike it's predecessor ou sucessor. Of course after sometime you'll start to get used to the controls, but they still feel weird. The UI is not friendly even for games older than it is, Age of Empires II is older and has a much more friendly interface and controls.

The game looks very bad even for its generation, Age of Wonders and Medieval Total War had much better visual quality. Civilization III looks so bad that if affects gameplay, you need to often take a closer look to identify some terrains and unities. There are no options for good graphic enhancements, you can not adjust resolution, it's based on desktop resolution, and even tweaking can't get satisfactory results. I know it's an old game, but the ones I cited are old too and are from the same genre. At least the game showed an improvement compared to the previous title, texture quality is better and there are movement animations for the unities.

Overall - 5.8

Its editor is simple to use and its modding community is huge even after all these years (possibly even the largest of the series from what I've seen). You can find mods and extremely well-done player-made campaigns about everything from the Reconquista and the Punic Wars to the Portuguese Colonial War. I especially recommend Age of Imperialism (the mod), and Escape from Zombie Island is another gem that shows just how much can be done with the game's relatively simple editor, completely transforming a game about empire-building into a game about zombie survival. But to be honest, even the vanilla, unmodded game is a blast to play and never really gets old.

Do not waste time on this unless you are one of those wonderful few who enjoys reading 5 paragraphs of text about how best to utilize workers only to realize there is absolutely no explanation on how to use them or even make them. 2 turns in and city starts burning, without fail. 
4 tries on easy mode and either I'm the dumbest creature to ever roam these parts or this game is a waste of money, take your pick.

Here you are!

This is a basic turned based Real Time Strategy game based around building a civilation from a tribal state to a modern age.

The Charm of this game really comes from your opponates, how they'll mock you, or try to threaten you to give them what they want. You can completely civil, or you can be a thorn in everyone's side, which can get to the point of the entire planet trying to destroy you.

A problem is that the mechanics can be confusing, heck it took me a solid three hours of reading to get a basic grasp on the game. but once you learn it, it's down, and it become second nature.

Another problem, if you can call it one, is that this game will burn hours of your life without your consent, seriously, you will play 4 hours stright and swear it was maybe 30 minutes.

Great RTS game play

great freedom to choose

First off you have to micromanage to be effective for longer than a few dozens of turns. You have to at least a thousand years in the future to avoid dead ends. You will at some point have to deal with long stretches of nothing to do but click the next turn button. Which WILL leave you paranoid that your enemy is pulling ahead. (On higher difficulties they are)
That said seeing a strategy work when you weren't certain it would, or looking at the 5-6 techs you have on EVERYONE can be amazing.
So if you like a game that makes you fear idling, an AI that won't give you a break, and some amazing victories, pick it up.
If you have the dosh though pick up one the later ones first;

I had to lower the screen resolution to avoid the 'tiny-litle-units' making my ayes go into pain. :-) But after all these years, I really enjoyed again the struggle to build a sivilization. There are newer versions of the same game nowdays. But I really believe that each of the Civilization games has its unique satisfaction to offer the strategy gamer, even if Civ IV is my prefered one.

I definetly recoment CIV III, especially moded with mods like ""Rise And Rule"", which add many new units, technologies etc.  The problem is, I can not clearly identify what is this 'different gameplay aspects' that kept me playing CIV II all these hous and not starting a CIV IV or CIV V campain... The differenses on units, wonders, railway inprovements etc, should not be enouph to get me playing a game as old as this one... On the other hand, I got myself missing the real-movie councelors of CIV-II, but I don't think I will play that old love again :-)

In any case. Considering the very low price that you can purchse this old game (Civilization III), especially in a bountle together with the newet versions, I definetly believe that any gamer that likes turn -base build-expand strategies should give it a try. Even for the shenarios of the 'complete' edition, a CIV-V fun could find in CIV-III a way to further expand his Civilization gamepleasure.

   But anyway the reason your reading this is to learn weather or not this game is worth 5 bucks to buy. To answer that you must ask  yourself some questions.
1) do you like running your own country and mercilessly clicking other countries to death?
2) do you like exploring randomly generated worlds and clicking other countries to death?
3) do you like sending hundreds of units at enemys to make them fight to the death with other countries units by clicking?
4) do you enjoy classical music while clicking other countires to death?
5) do you care that there are 3 newer versions of the game?

If you answered yes to 1-4 and no to 5 BUY THE GAME
If you answered yes to 5 don't buy the game you nostalgia hater
If you answered no to 5 and yes to 3 of the first 4 questions then BUY THE GAME
If you answered no to 5 and yes to 2 of the first 4 questions you may want to consider waiting untill the game goes on sale
If you answered no to 5 and yes to 1 of the first 4 questions you may be looking at the wrong genre of games 
If you answered yest to 5 and no to the first 4 questions you ARE looking at the wrong genre of games

Civilization III (or Civ III for short) is an argricultural war simulator, in which you build wheat, farm iron, and thresh people in a significant battle over land and cities.


Should you take too long to murder your foes, the game may decide to just let you win by saying you're so cultural that there's no way they can challenge you, and they automatically forefeit. Which is stupid, because a rich culture like that is not as likely to have the vast killing potential an uncultured brutish army nation would, but alas, not everything in life, or Civ, is logical.

Especially the Inca’s, in two games I have met them and in both have tried to destroy me. Why, Is it because there militaristic? No. The Greeks tried to attack me and there also scientific, are the Byzantines just shit? It was Same problem with the English.

I’m not above a challenge, but when everyone else seems to be researching at a far greater pace than me, and as a result have fucking guns when I still have bows and arrows? That’s just shit. Also enemy troops must be covered in fucking kryptonite because it takes 3 to take down 1.

Here are a few topics that I wish to highlight:
- It is a low-paced, turn-based strategy game with a significant amount of historical content.
- There are a few variables in the game that the person should learn before starting to play. Luckily, steam provides us with a manual, so DO read it.
- For beginners, this game may become tough, even at the lowest difficulty setting. Even after learning the basics, there are many things one can do wrong.
- This game can take MANY hours of your time, and once your civilization has more than 10 settlements, it may take more than a minute to play each game turn. In addition, there may be dozens and dozens of turns before a victory condition is met.
- Although it DOES seem to work on my Windows 8.1 machine, there are a few frustrating issues, such as window switching not restoring the original resolution until the game is terminated. Also, the game may occasionally crash on some particular user, and so far it has always crashed after the end of a game. This means that the game could have had a better preparation for modern systems.

Therefore, it is both hard to recommend and unrecommend this game. Take this as a midline evaluation. If you have time to spare, go ahead and give it a try.

That said, It' s a solid 4X title, Graphically, it's obviously not going to be State of the Art, but I've never found that to matter with this genre; and apparently neither have most people given that one of the most popular 4X games around is Alpha Centari, which came out in 1999. 

Sorry, got a bit off topic.

Like all the Civ games, Civilization 3 puts you in control of a settler and warrior, kicks you into the oceon that is its game play and tells you to swim. The tutorial is there, but it's basically a series of tips that pop up when you start doing things. well written and concise, but they don't force your hand. Also like the other Civ games, there is a large tech tree and ages to advance through as your empire grows. The main appeal of the game is that no two playthroughs [which can take weeks to months if you play casually] are ever going to be the same. One game History may play out as you destroy the Aztecs as the Spanish... but in the next game, Gahndi might nuke your American ass into oblivion. 

Ultimately, 4X games aren't for everyone, but everyone should give the genre a try and at the price they're asking for it, Civ 3 is an affordable, still good looking, and complete introduction to the genre as well as a game that experienced players will enjoy for years to come.

[[A note on the CIv Franchise: those of you who started civ with 4 or 5 should also give 3 a try, the three titles are honestly different enough that they could be said to be equally good in their own right, assuming of course that you have the DLC for Civ 5, otherwise.... *shudders*]]",1403328482,1403328482,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.66E+16,324,1,396,0,317,1550602062

If you're new or interested in Civilization games, I HIGHLY recommend reading further and/or watching videos to understand what you are getting into:

Pros-

This game is highly detailed and allows for a significant amount of strategy-management decisions. Learning the system and ""how to beat it"" itself was an enjoyable that I still can't fully claim to have achieved.

Cons-

There is no help in-game in actually learning the game. This will either add hours of patience in learning the game, or frustration.

The computer AI is abhorrent for trading.

Fair Warning: This game is SLOW. I am okay about slow games, when I am mentally prepared for it. This game is so slow, whether due to micromanagement, organizing your thoughts, or constant unit/city decisions. In my opinion, the pacing of this game is not evidence of a detailed well thought out game (which yes, it is), but of a poorly designed game. Even in ""speed-mode""...just ugh, it's still slow.


I suggest that if you are interested in a strategic, decision-making game, and ok with long games, the Civilization games will suit your needs. Furthermore, I suggest looking into Galactic Civilizations, at the least for the sake of a real tutorial.

27,Sid Meier's Civilization® III Complete,9755744,english,"For a game made all the way back in October 2001, this is a fantastic game.

First off, if you bought Civilization Revolution for the Xbox 360 or iPad, that is nothing compared to this old but fantastic game.
Secondly, make sure you play this when you havn't got anything else to do in the next 24 hours because this game takes some time and patients and you are guranteed to get 100% addicted.
However, if you want to go online, nobody will be on there and if you host a server nobody will join (unless, of course, one of your friends have the game and you invite them). Also, on your first game you ever play, make sure you make it so it's on the easiest difficulty and do a little amount of Civilizations otherwise you will get brutally battered like a Cod fish.

10 features Civilization 3 has that Civilization Revolution Doesn't

1. You can alter the map size between Tiny and Huge.
2. You can alter the settings on how to win the game.
3. The Middle Age is included.
4. You get workers to build Outposts, Mines, Barricades, Irrigation (farm/food resources) etc.
5. There is more research.
6. More units.
7. Create your own map in the editor.
8. Edit the map properties.
9. More Civilizations.
10. More Civilizations allowed to be active in game.

Keep in mind that Civilization Revolution is newer than Civilization 3.
I can't really think of anything you can't do in Civilization 3 that you can in Civilization Revolution.
I cannot compare Civilization 3 to Civilization 2, 4 and 5 as I do not have those and I have never played them. I would assume that Civilization 4 and 5 are better though.
I completely reccomend this game and I'd say it is still a brilliant game now in 2014 and that takes a lot for a game to be that good!

I was hoping that Civ IV was that point where the devs went through a 'lets temporarily sell out and fuck up the franchise for a while' phase, but it turns out Civ III is shitty as well.

Okay, it's not as silly as Civ IV.  In may ways, I still despise Civ IV, but I'll admit it's a nitpick.  I'd give it the same rating otherwise, because it's almost the same game.  Civ IV's interpretation of religion is silly.  Read the other review for more about that.

Okay, enough about fucking Civ IV, lets talk about Civ III.  But what is there to talk about really?  I tried to have fun, but it was the dullest 5 hours on chieftain (easiest difficulty) of moving around a bunch of soldiers and workers (that's all this game is, soldiers and workers and building ROADS) with the scandinavian vikings that I used to conquer the Aztec empire (ultimately a game of city tag), while fending off Japanese and Romans, I've ever had.  Eventually, I resigned, because Sumeria was really big, Persia entered a 'golden age', and I had to end it at some point.

There was no way to end this game properly without playing for another 8 hours, and that was a standard size map.

MAJOR IRRITATING PROBLEM:  From the origional, after a unit moves, the game jumps to the next (not nearest) unit that may be half a world away.  There is no way to stop and look at what your just-moved unit saw without scrolling to find it.  This becomes very irritating after a while.  I had forgotten about it.  It is not a bug, it is programming design.  This got fixed in later games so the game paused after each unit moves, allowing you to stay in an area and complete a battle before moving on by hitting a key when YOU are ready.

First of all this title still holds up tremendously well nowadays, it runs on newer operation systems and you can tweak the resolution in a file making the game really great to play. There aren't any issues at all.

Civ3 is not as complex as Civ4 and doesn't have such intricate indepth mechanics but still manages to keep the player busy, you have to manage several aspects of your empire. The more streamlined gameplay makes this Civilization my favorite, it's easy to understand but yet very hard to master. You get down the basics really fast but in order to be good at it, you need some serious practise. There are tons of different civilizations to choose from and many different scenarios. The included expansion offer even more content. The AI is really good and easily challenge you, even on lower difficulties.

I would say ANY Civilization game so far is a buyer and a keeper, if you are into turn based strategy games.
The only reason Civilization 1 is missing from my collection is the rareness of finding someone having and willing to sell his/her copy, I woud jump at the change;)

every Civ Game adds a little and removes a little, the one that you like most is personal flavour.
To me this one certainly ranks higher than the later Civ 4 and 5.
This game was and is the height of ""classic"" Civilization games.

For you people ariving at this from Civ 2 : you only will miss the old advisors (civ 5 and they still not have returned them sadly enough)
For you people ariving at this from Civ 4 and 5 : no religion, but instead you will love the stacks of doom, army units, and other things that were removed in later game.

This game is also somewhat older and a lot lighter on system requirements than later civ games, making it great to play on any device you want to.

I have sunk a huge amount of hours into this game and for me this is the best game in the series.

Civilization is probably the most dominating Turn-based strategy game in the gaming industry. The Total Wars games for example are RTS/TBS hybrids, while CIV is completely TBS. True Civilization enthusiasts probably rank Civ3 pretty low, compared to Civ2, Civ4 and Civ5 which were very well received for their times. For me however, Civilization 3 is the favorite among the ones I've played (Civ3, Civ4 and Civ5). Again - because of it's nostalgic value.

All Civ games start out the same way unless you play a scenario or campaign. You start off with a settler and a warrior of some sorts. The settler can build a city, and as you find a suitable location for your capital - let your Civilization begin! Beware though, once you have started a game you won't be able to leave for at least 4 hours. This game is honestly best played during the night and is mostly a single-player experience.

There is a Campaign/Scenario mode, where you play historical events or just silly settings. As well as a multiplayer mode, but I have never enjoyed these ones at all. Nothing beats that random map mode, select the terrain, the climate, map size and your opponents/allies. Let the history get rewritten as you choose the path of the righteous, or the path of the tyrant. Through exploding expansion, racing technology, crushing warfare and cunning diplomacy you must stand victor as the one and only dominating superpower.

[b]I only recommend picking this up if you have a personal connection to it, or if you are entirely out of gameplay from modern titles.[/b]

25,Sid Meier's Civilization® III Complete,175180,english,"Sid Meier's Civilization III, the sequel to the great Civilization II, a game that by some is still to this day considered to be the best of the series, has the heavy duty challenge of not only living up to the standards set by it's predecessors but also to innovate the franchise enough that players of the previous installment can be bothered to upgrade.

It starts out with a somewhat mixed feeling. Some of the great ideas from Alpha Centauri has been brought over creating a much more versatile playing field with a living map and more unique factions but many of Alpha Centauri's greatest assets, such as the ability to build your own units and terrain elevations are notably absent. and others, such as unique factions, are only half implemented.

These improvements however do still manage to increase the interactivity of the game substantially particularly when combined with the many new features, such as culture, that Civ III brings to the table.

Factions are not longer defined simply by their city names but now have a few unique units of little consequence and civilization traits of great consequence. Unique units are simply beefed up versions of regular units that give a faction a small military advantage during the time period in which the unit is present, this can be a nice boost if you happen to go to war in that time but it can also be ignored completely if the time for war is not right. The traits each faction receives now however are of a much greater importance and can range from getting a free technology every age to a half off cost on religious buildings. These traits are big enough in effect that they tend to define your entire game.

A new and important feature in Civ III is culture. Each city generates culture through it's various buildings and the culture in turn defines the size of it's borders. A heavily cultured city can even envelop the city of an opponent and flip it to your side. While the realism or historical accuracy of such a device is laughable at best it does provide players with a new means of expansion and a way to deal with those pesky resource stealing late game cities that the AI is so fond of placing in whatever unoccupied corner of your empire it can find.

Graphically Civilization III is passable as always, the city view is pleasant but the rest of the game gives only a mediocre visual experience. Nothing pretty but nothing that'll ruin your gaming experience either. The soundtrack is still mostly orchestral epics and works very well although the rest of the sound effects in the game are pretty forgettable.

All in all Sid Meier's Civilization III is a good sequel. It doesn't create quite the same feeling of amazement and enjoyment that going from Civ I to Civ II does but it manages to provide a good solid experience with enough innovation to justify the purchase.",1370435089,1385408748,TRUE,14,0,0.657378018,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.66E+16,2307,246,16920,0,10025,1414318268

CIV2 made minor enhancements, but was largely the same game.  The first time I played CIV3, I hated it.  The strategies I had developed for 1&2 no longer worked (the catapult is quite different, for example) and it took me a few minutes to grok the culture concept.  Once I did (and learned the unit differences), I never went back.  The AI is sooo much better than before and unlike CIV4 (which despite buying and forcing myself to play, I never enjoyed), you still get to micromanage a great deal (but you can also automate quite a bit - the ability to choose is awesome).
