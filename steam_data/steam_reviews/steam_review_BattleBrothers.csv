0,77151483,english,"[h1]Perk Synergy Heaven[/h1]

After three years of playing Battle Brothers, this week I finally beat 'The Black Monolith', which for the uninitiated is the original bad boy location to beat, in the vanilla game. In Steam hours played (all 1333 hours of them so far) it's second only to GTA V on my list, and I mention this to illustrate how easy it is to pick up, yet how difficult it is to master - if that's even possible. This game endures like chess, but I'll try to keep this as brief as possible...

Ok, so I'm a methodical dummy - I'll accept that; others begat the 'Monolith' accolade a fraction of the hours in, but me? I like to experience everything a game's got; I did it my way about 5 times (bull-headedly), and ended up fed up. Then I took a six month break, went back, and this time did my best to read, comprehend, and inwardly absorb to the max all the information on the screen - and tried one more campaign. Finally, it all clicked, and by day 1000 (or so) I was smiting down all comers with my properly legendary crew. You can go along being sort of ok late game with a 2nd rate party, but unless you're doing things well, there are some fights you should avoid. In many ways, this will always be the case, but how you minimise this quotient becomes a measure of success.

Have I fought a Kraken yet? Apart from the fact I can't even find one, I'm not interested - it would dent my pride too much. ;-) See? This is how the game gets you - you build, you plot, you plan, you improve, and you make headway. When you see your star bros (as they are known) getting seven bells kicked out of them, it brings a virtual tear to the eye. I'm currently on a 'veteran' play-through, but 'beginner' is hard enough - believe! Iron man is for superheros.

All this aside, the best comparisons that can be made to this game's DNA are 'Battletech', and 'Mount and Blade: Warband/Bannerlord'. Think open world, endless sandbox, but you can constrain, rogue-like, if you prefer, and go for points. 

The things that set Battle Brothers apart from other similar games are too numerous to list. What I'll mention (and absolutely can't go without mentioning!) is the perk/skill system; it's one of the best out there. The developers of this game have clearly sat down with pen and paper, and committed their brilliant insight unto one another, thrown it around, chewed it up, spat it out, eaten it again, and repeated during the course of development. The way the perks and skills synergise and play off of one another is sublimely complex, and just when you think you have your build sussed - mwah-ha-ha - you really don't. Go back kid, and think again. And even when you build your dream team - you'll still be wishing you chose 'Underdog' instead of 'Battle Forged' for your star two-hander bro. Or maybe 'Nimble'. Or maybe you should have given them more initiative so they could dodge more instead of being a tank, but then... AAARGH! The contemplation goes round in circles - but in a good way.

The perk system is completely unique, and is very much its own thing. It's the core and the strength of Battle Brothers, and is its absolute life-blood. It's the thing that will fox you, out-fox you, and make you gnash your teeth in delight and despair; in short, it's brilliantly balanced, and fiendishly so. It's this very finite, constrained set of options that leads to such complex, nebulous outcomes. Brain-goggling stuff, and so well executed.

To round off, the art style is similarly unique. Ever wanted a cartoon of the Bayeux Tapestry? Well there you go. The sound design is top drawer - every gut-wrenching yelp and crunch tells you intuitively what you need to know, and delivers the gratification of stabbing a cartoon medieval guy in the gambesons. 

And finally, the soundtrack. Wow. Perhaps my favourite game soundtrack of all time. When you open the game for the first time, let it sit at the menu for a few minutes, and just breathe it in. It's as if Mahler wrote a game soundtrack. Stunning! 

Ok, then there are the other pieces of soundtrack that don't sound like Mahler, but they're all equally good too. So good, in fact, that they kept going around my head when I was trying to sleep, and I had to disable the in-game music - but that's my loss. ;-)

Look, if you're reading this wondering whether to buy the game, you already know what you're going to do. Don't listen to the nay-sayers - they don't understand lol. 

Like Warband/Battletech/Kenshi?

4,77107727,english,"It's a rough game to say the least. 

Some mechanics don't seem well thought out, and some might make you curse at the screen (like a necromancer reviving the same body over and over and over, like it doesn't deteriorate every time you kill it, it comes back with exactly the same strength/power... and - I might be wrong here - but I think reviving as a zombie restarts the individual's fatigue, which is a crucial mechanic in the game). There is a lot that isn't explained to you and you will have to figure out (youtube videos will help, but you shouldn't have to do that).
Hit chance is very specific to the scenario and it not being displayed when you are hovering over your target will make you wonder why you missed 4 times in a row but your enemy hit every attack even though you should have the advantage (like higher terrain). Also, the fatigue mechanic seems somewhat too punishing. Using only weapon ability total and then attacking each turn, your character might run out of fatigue by the third or fourth time you used him in a battle. From then on, he will only be able to attack once every turn, and not much, if anything else, rendering him almost useless. Making him do nothing on his turn won't accelerate his recuperation either.
While the different types of enemies make battles more interesting, some times they are waaaay too challenging for the level you are in, and you won't even be able to tell before engaging, most of the times. 

Mission's payment level won't correlate at all with the difficulty of the mission, since many of the moving parts of each mission are based on chance. A mission that will pay you upwards of 1000 gold might be uneventful (protect a supply caravan, but nobody attacks), a 115 gold mission (that shouldn't really even be a thing, since that amount of gold won't be enough to afford almost anything in a market) might include a couple of engagements and make you lose half of your manpower over nearly no reward. The worst part is that you might not even have a choice, since some settlements will only have that one contract up for grabs, and the game doesn't let you have more than a single contract active at the same time (the reasons for this eludes me, since not all contracts seem time constrained/an emergency).

Other than buffs/debuffs from the character's respective background and injuries suffered in battle, and a few stats that they increase more rapidly (talents?), which will dictate what they are better at and therefore how you should employ them in battle, characters don't differ from eachother a lot. None feel unique, or irreplaceable. It's not necessarily a bad thing, but I guess I expected something more.

Over all, I'm quite disappointed with the game. I think the concept has a huge potential but the delivery leaves most of it still in the table. I personally feel like this game is a rough sketch, or an early access experience (without the many bugs part though). I'd recommend avoiding it or buying it on a steep discount.

The artwork has a lot of love put into it, it makes you feel like you are a part of this harsh world.

The mechanics are easy to learn but hard to master. Your team and your tactics are 100% customizable, so it's up to you to make your mercenary team succed in every encounter with minimal casualties. Casualties are very hard to overcome, meaning that you will have to recruit another mercenary and equip them and train them from scratch.

The game has sometimes incredibly complicated battles to resolve, and while not all battles are winnable, you are always able to run away (should you realise it  early enough!) and will get away without much harm unless your opponent has dogs or something to catch and keep you.

The game art is great, especially the mercenary icons. The soundtrack is amazing, from the barbarian throat singing to sitar sounds of the south.

The map generation is really good and fun.

People say this game can be brutal and has a steep learning curve. They are absolutely correct.

On the plus side once you manage to not die in your first combat the game is very rewarding. Slowly skill up. Slowly fill your ranks. Carefully pick contracts based on your perceived skill level. Get new gear. Feel badarse. Die to a man in your next contract.... I mean one shot noob bandits with your new archer.

Play revolves around travelling the main map to either take contracts in the multiple villages, or to explore searching for camps and tombs, or to be run down by a larger group of bandits who have decided you are worth bullying.

The game then switches to the combat map which is hex based turn based combat where each figure in the battle gets to act based on initiative. Despite the relatively basic animations - your men are basically little 2D pawns with no arms or legs - the combat feels brutal. Bones crunch, flesh tears and the occasional head lops clean off.

Yes it is hard, but your game, your rules. Scum save (I do) if you feel you need to, or go Ironman if you are a better player than I am.

DLCs all add to the game with new enemies to totally own you, new gear and new starting options.

The RNG is such that a death can occur in a single blow, regardless of armor or other precautions, and when that occurs to a Brother that is of significant level, then the loss of your investment is huge.  It takes a significant amount of time and money to advance your characters, and a single death at higher levels is just an unacceptable loss, especially since the difficulty of all future battles will continue to increase despite this loss.  Eventually you get stuck in a slow death cycle that can only be beat if you enjoy re-loading the game over and over, sometimes choosing to ignore missions altogether, despite the (false) indication that the mission is easy or medium difficulty.

even so if it really was 95% or even 85% percent chance to hit and i consistently miss 3 times in a row. is it really that percent? the math does not add up. numbers do not lie. this games numbers lie constantly. the player is constantly having to worry about their characters getting oneshot headshot by the ai consistently even with the most meta builds and meta character traits and stats. no matter how stronger your brother is. a brigand thug will walk up with a flail and use thresh  and get a head crit twice and instant kill them. any level or any background doesnt matter and has no intrinsic value throughout the majority of the game. 

perks like steel brow and colossus are really the only defense you have against rigged rng like this. however having to take these perks severely limits the creativity in builds, and half of the perks in the game are useless. often you will find yourself picking the same perks over and over and over again without straying to far off lest you want to die. 

the hardest part about battle brothers is surviving the early game. once you get past day 30 its all down hill from there and you can kinda snowball on beginner. which is really the only difficulty you can play without having a stroke.

This game is basically isometric 2D [i]Mount & Blade[/i], which is basically all I've ever wanted in my life. The game talks a big game about how hard it is, which is fine - I'm a-ok playing on beginner because I don't want my hobbies to end up giving me a stroke. The way the game encourages you to play, however, is to plow straight through and give yourself the opportunity to lose. All well and good, but there's also another way to play: treating each battle as a puzzle that you can solve, and reloading as you figure things out. If you're just beginning, playing that way may teach you more tactically about how the game thinks, and then you can go brutal on a higher difficulty. 

Shout-out to some of the later-game additions, like dogs and falcons, which I loved and wish there was more of in the base game. Speaking of the late-game aspects, the ""crises"" that hit the world in the 80-100 day range are interesting (and I'm intrigued that I was given the opportunity to ignore), but I was kind of surprised that win conditions can be hit in a little over three months in-game.

25,75958611,english,"A great game! At first, the graphics and game mechanics do look simple, but the gameplay is so addictive (I played over 60 hours in two weeks!). One thing I absolutely love about this game is the ability to play shield-wall like the old times Vikings, Medieval, etc. So this definitely will fulfill your fantasy of playing in the shield-wall. RPG level ups are a nice touch for your men in the unit. You can specialize in your men with specific weapons. I have two crossbowmen, two archers, two long spearmen, two swordsmen, two-handed swordsmen, and two macemen. They play together beautifully. The enemies crash into your shield wall and you grind them down, envelop them around the edges, once you break down the middle of the enemies cluster, then you attack their archers & crossbowmen, the rest would start to panic and flee. I also like the contract and trading system, you can negotiate contracts and buy materials & food at lower prices & sell them higher in the next town. You can buy upgrades to armor and weapons or find rare ones at locations in the wilderness. I would say that this game is similar to Mount & Blade except the turn-based combat is better. 

Highly recommended if you liked turn-based combat such as Jagged Alliance 2, XCOM, King’s Bounty.

Remember to diversify your team's backgrounds (this affects the random events you can receive) as well as your front line's weapons.  The game is easier if you particular units prepared to deal with particular threats.  The game is punishing if you do not consider this.  Spears, swords, axes, and maces all have different archetypes they are most effective in countering in a not-so-rock-paper-scissors kind of way.

Though many of your men will die as you progress, that actually opens up windows to get stronger units (both better backgrounds and more adequately built for your team).  The variety of world forms is awesome, though the mission variety and enemy groups does become somewhat repetitive as you get towards the mid and end game.

36,75850470,english,"I bought this game a few years ago.  Thinking it was a simple RPG-tactic hybrid with rubbish un-animated graphics, I tried to blast through the game & played it for 40 hours.

Frustrated with my lack of progress, I put it down.  A few weeks ago, maybe it was seeing Filthy Robot constantly playing it, I decided to give it another go.  I fell in love and 285 hours later I'm still learning the game.  Some BB YTers say you need to put in at least 1000 hours to start to understand the depth of this game.  I'm starting to see what they are saying.  It's not complicated, but it is complex - different simple systems all working together, providing one of the greatest tactical games I've played in 35 years of gaming.

BB is very heavy on RNG.  Sometimes, you can progress quite far without losing a single brother, then BAM.  1-2 brothers dead.  Replay the same battle and it's a breeze with no casualties.

There are no tutorial zones or dedicated areas you can farm NPCs & enemies scale with the size of your team, average level and number of days you have lived.  So you have to minimise the effect of the RNG, like only accepting certain contracts and gearing/ levelling/recruiting your Bro's a certain way.  But that only comes with experience or watching YT hints/tips vids.  Once your Bro's are sufficiently geared/levelled, you can take on pretty much any contract without too many worries, but up to that point, RNG can (and will) kill you.

Juggling gold, tools, food, ammo, Bro mood are simple enough elements of the game.  Ultimately it is the number of ways you can spec your Bro's (perks, stats, gear), Bro formations, weapon/utility abilities and tactics which determine how long your company survives.

My only wish, is that NPCs didn't scale based on your Bros/no. of days.  I'd rather level 1-20 RNG NPCs roamed different zones & you progressed through the game more in a manner like Mount & Blade.

44,75801570,english,"As I lay here, under the serene blue sky, sipping nectar from an elder tree, I begin to philosophize about my peculiar, albeit enthralling adventures of Battle Brothers. The constant conflicts, the massacres of the defenceless, the tussles with giant, aggravated furry creatures, these memories all dawn on me. It was rare in these days to not lose a fellow man while delving into the unknown, and even rarer to find a man equalling his vast attributes, but alas just like time, life carries on. Soon I began to play and became engrossed within the world, it didn't matter if one, two, three or however, many died, they were only chess pieces designed to further my goals in saving Rivellion. Sure initially I was devastated when I lost my good man Hugo, but when Liffleheart fell my devastation began to subside, ultimately the constant warfare had desensitised me. I plundered and pillaged, nary a concern for the destruction I had wrought, the families I had utterly ruined, or the economy which was being shattered after every successful raid. I was effectively becoming a grey whiskered, wizened veteran, desiring only to acquire my next paycheck, and to complete the next mission. Sometimes for a bit of sport I used to allow peasants to attempt a retreat, only to slice them down mercilessly, laughing manically as the bloodlust, the adrenaline, moulded me into a calculating and ruthless leader. It is woeful to contemplate on the immense quantities of life that I undoubtedly extinguished during those days, the contracts I carried out, the bandits I thoroughly violated, it was truly a time of crisis. That was until I met BJ the Rosebush, in a local temple. This rosebush was startling, she seemed to accumulate the light within her pure soul, I was immediately entranced. From that moment onward's I begun wooing my future wife, I used to take her out for walks, go slaying Orc's together, and even a couple of times we together as a couple set fire to the nobles estate, listening to the screams of ""Help me"", all the while giggling in youthful laughter at our innocent prank. Gradually as we courted my heart begun to reluctantly, albeit continuously soften. Shortly after our acquaintance I proposed to BJ, the most beautiful of Rosebushes and soon all the mercenaries and villages I had helped attended my pure wedding, presenting us with bouquets of flowers. The moment we both said, ""I do"" and swore our Christian vowels, immediately solidifying each other in indefinite matrimony I felt as though a great weight had been lifted upon my shoulders. From then on onward's I would do my wife and future children proud, leading as an honourable and efficient leader, feeding my troops, atoning for my crimes against snobby nobles and being an upstanding citizen.

52,75731872,english,"I wanted to like Battle Brothers, but there's several design choices that make the game an absolute chore to play:

1. The map you're playing on is incredibly important and the generator isn't great, meaning it can create some [i]really[/i] awful maps. Of course, you'll waste many hours on bad maps before you figure out that you're often dead in the water from the onset. For example, I got a map that had a single harbor in it. Harbors allow you to instantly travel to other harbors for a fee. Thus, the logical thing to do is to make sure the generator guarantees at least two Harbors spawn per map, because [b]a single Harbor is literally useless[/b]. There are other frustrations such as how close villages & cities are together because getting good contracts early on is both incredibly important and very frustrating:

2. The contracts offered by cities and towns are extremely inconsistent in their risk/reward. In the early game the only contracts worth taking are fighting Bandits and Undead because you [i]need[/i] to gear your men, and only Bandits and some Undead drop gear. You're completely at the whim of RNG to get these contracts. Taking early beast contracts is completely worthless because you get no gear from them, they're more dangerous than bandit contracts, and the loot you [i]do[/i] get sells for very, very little gold. Simply making beast ""parts"" sell for more would solve this problem. Caravan contracts are always more dangerous than they're worth (by a large margin) and delivery contracts tend to only pay enough to cover supplies for the trip and, thus, are only worth doing if you're going to the destination village / city to get a new contract! It's also entirely likely you'll find either no contracts being offered at nearby villages at all, or only getting contracts that you're not nearly strong enough to complete.

3. Reliably getting the aforementioned gear to drop at the loot screen is another painful experience. In order to get the armor set off of an enemy you need to kill him without damaging the armor too badly. This leads to tactics such as ""dagger farming"" that feels awkward and like ""gaming the system"" to get ahead, but you [b]have to do this to make it through the early game.[/b] If I manage to rout the last few bandits, why not allow my men to ""capture"" them and strip them of their gear in exchange for their lives? This would be a much cleaner experience for the player.

4. The animations in the game are brutally slow. I don't ever want to spend four minutes waiting for 20 zombies to shamble toward my men. There's a mod that alleviates this to a degree, but this was the very first thing that stood out to me in the first two hours of play -- I can't believe there's not a native animation speed setting available in the options menu. [b]Respect the player's time.[/b]

5. The game doesn't pause the ""world clock"" when you're looking at inventory screens and alike. Given that the world clock determines the very difficulty of the world around you (falling behind often leads to a restart), I often found myself cursing at the screen after realizing that I'd lost a day while managing Brothers for absolutely no reason. Just auto-pause the damn world when the player is not actively moving or interacting with the world map!

6. Battle Brothers fails to deliver important information to the player. Many important numbers are hidden to the player and only communicated through symbols or vague descriptions. The enemy band has ""Some Direwolves""...how much is ""Some""? 3-6? ""Many Orcs"" ... 8-12? The only reason to hide these numbers is to force the player to take fights and eventually learn what these ranges are from experience, but that's neither fun nor challenging. It's tedious and tiresome. Combat numbers are the same way, both in the modifiers that your attacks are getting (+/- symbols only, no numbers provided) and the enemy health and armor stats are not provided in exact numbers [i][b]despite these pieces being the same as the ones your men wear.[/b][/i] Thus, you can figure out what the exact numbers are through memorizing the visual of the armor piece to the values, but this is again just tedious and tiresome. Again, mods help here but it's extremely frustrating that you need to find external resources to make informed decisions in a [i]tactical[/i] strategy game.

7. Locations on the map also hide what they contain from the player. You're constantly finding areas marked ""Unknown Garrison"" on the map. Turns out, most of these garrisons far exceed what the player could tackle early on but you're forced to save scum to figure this out. This alone makes playing the game on Ironman extremely frustrating. Many players, such as myself, want to play Ironman for the challenge but we're forced to play a non-Ironman run first to learn about all the little ""gotchas"" like this. [b]If the game clearly communicated this information to the player it would be a far more enjoyable experience.[/b] Of course, you could enter the fray and immediately retreat but then you have to spend six minutes watching 20+ characters take their turns as your men run. Respect the player's time!

Battle Brothers seems to revel in being intentionally obtuse. Whereas something like XCOM provides a great tactical experience, even on the hardest of difficulties, through a clean interface and well-communicated information, Battle Brothers forces the player to drudge through tedious experimentation and needless repetition. An XCOM Impossible/Ironman run needs the first few missions to go perfectly to get a good run going, Battle Brothers feels like it needs a few days of your time to do the same. It's extremely frustrating to me how close Battle Brothers comes to being great. Thankfully, mods go a long way in alleviating many of the aforementioned issues. That said, I'd gladly give Battle Brothers another go if a large ""quality of life"" update was released for it.

I was tasked with getting rid of a crypt, simple. But the problem was that there were 3 geists(And also about 9 armored zombies). If you don't know they can use an ability which causes fear to your characters effecting a small range. The problem is that with 3 of them in 1 turn they can waver and sometimes even break your morale. I have tried several times to beat this but the zombies  would body block my characters. Whenever i would kill the zombie line and have a breakthrough the geists would start first after the first turn and break my guys morale even with my sergeant. I couldn't even get to them because those 9 armored zombies would be able to revive 3 to 4 zombies every 2 turns about. FiIling their line back in and getting free attacks when my guys try to run. These situations where it is impossible to win ruin the experience because i have tried different strategies and they don't work. This was a 2 skull rating but i can't beat it.
These situations happen rarely though so i would still say get the game but sometimes you just get screwed and can't do anything about it.",1599597877,1599749335,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,4,True,False,False,76561198443201137,89,6,2458,0,2373,1599934001,,

57,52899765,english,"So just a week ago the burgmeister of Thal, an windy hamlet of miners and goat herders lost in the mountainous heart of the continent, had set a rather large bounty on the head of the Robber Baron. The unsavory old brigand and his band had raided one too many caravans. I pledged to return with his head, took an advance payment to stock up on food and arrows, and led my fifteen men east.

We soon left behind the relative safety of the roads and stroke through the hills and ridges which sprawl wildly out east. The camp of the self-appointed Baron was hidden in a small gully hidden by scrappy brushes. A good spot, with a small stream for water and a couple of trees offering shelter from the midday sunlight. We enveloped the camp from a distance and waited for dark. Eventually the bandits gathered around their fire to skewer and roast a pair of piglets. 

Let this serve you as a lesson: starring at a fire at nightfall is the worst thing to do when there's a bounty on your head and hardy mercenaries out to get you... We took them in a pincer movement, Halfred leading most of our men from the north and Ser Hugh, our grizzled hedge knight, coming from the south with Tristram and Grimner. Their bowmen tried finding a target in the dark but the few shots they didn't miss were caught by our shields. The Baron shouted for a defensive formation but it was too late. Blinded, surrounded, challenged by better armed and more experienced assailants, their moral broke down. The Baron himself was a stout fighter, clad in mail and leather, and he stood his ground. But what can a single man do when paid killers come at him in the night, hands full of daggers and heads full of murder? It was butcher's work. 

Soon we were cleaning our blades on the dead’s clothes and feasting on their well roasted piglets. To celebrate a job well done, I passed a small keg of hard booze to the men. The empty keg then served to store the severed head of the Robber Baron for our employer.

On the next day we ventured further east, looking for treasure or trophies. It was still morning when we came upon a small group of orcs on the hunt. Not much of a surprise, as we knew a warring tribe had recently claimed the southern plateau as its own, and not much of a challenge: these youngbloods were armed with javelins and clubs to bring down boars and dire wolves - not to deal with the likes of us. They soon broke before our skill and steel. The few who escaped the melee were brought down by archers or dogs.

Afterwards we followed their tracks up to a large camp on a hillside. Food grows scarce in those parts, and I decided to search the place for meat and valuables. I failed to place sentries atop the nearby hills, though, and it was only because Cadmace the Caravanner stayed outside the cave on the account of its stench that we knew of the warriors before they fell upon us. We quickly formed for battle as they charged uphill. A fearsome piece of orc was leading them, a great bulky tower of green muscle and black iron, shouting as it charged our frail shieldwall.

A mercenary captain can rarely afford mistakes. I've survived a couple of really bad calls: going drunk in my first battle, cheating a noble house, hunting a pair of adult lindwurms at nightime. What saved me and my men that day out east was the high ground and nothing more. We held and pushed back the orcs whenever they forced their way up. We did not let go, however bruised and bloody and exhausted we were. I can still see Halfred slamming his hammer with the strength of a mad man on the foes below, them barking in rage and pain. At his side, Volster took an orcish morningstar to the face and collapsed. Tordek the Tortoise took his place, slamming his shield into the greenskin before he could stomp his brother. The steel head of a pike drove through their champion's eye. The creature staggered, spraying dark green blood, and Tristram Treefeller brought it down with a mighty blow of his greataxe. Tristram used to be a lumberjack, chopping wood in the forests around Dunkelwald. Now he was chopping orcs in the badlands.

At the end of the day the hill was ours and we were tending to our fallen brothers. Volster was dead, the skull cracked open like a chestnut. Gamelin's arm had been hacked at the elbow. The young lad was in shock, covered in his own blood, starring at his swordhand on the ground. Cadmace made a tourniquet above the gaping wound with his leather belt. Humfrey the Hunter, our old bowman, had taken a javelin to the thigh. Both of our dogs had been slain. Fitz Bastardsword had been badly mauled by a berserker whose forceful hits had broken several of his ribs, but he was grinning all the same: a skillful swing of his two-handed sword had decapitated his opponent.

After a night's rest we left the area, our cart laden with our wounded and the loot we had taken from the orcs. I did not dare lead the men further east: the great valley beyond belonged to the goblins, and large bands of wolfriders were always foraging and patrolling about. With several men dead or too wounded to fight it would have been pushing our luck. So we turned back, travelling north west through the Bleak Woods: a wide forest of pinetrees, dense and dark, hiding huge colonies of webknechts and a couple of necromancers who survived the undead scourge mope-up campaign. We trudged through, using the distant mountain peaks for orientation. We were going slowly as Humfrey’s thigh wound caused him to limp painfully and the cart kept getting stranded in roots and potholes. The Baron's head was starting to smell and I was worried wolves would pick our scent. 

In the late afternoon a cart wheel got stuck hard between two roots of a huge pine. Night falls early in a forest, so we decided to stay and set the camp in a nearby glade. Tordek went off to gather drywood and cones while most of the company was unloading the cart or starting a fire. We soon heard strange cracks and a powerful thud from the direction Tordek had taken... The men picked up their weapons and were about to search for him when he ran back to our clearing, holding a broken wrist against him and shouting: [i]“Lads, my hatchet got kicked off my hand by a bloody TREE!”[/i]. At the same moment a huge branch slammed amongst us and threw two men on the ground. Some nearby pines started moving toward our small fire, creaking and swaying wildly. Panick seized the company for a moment. Then Tristram’s greataxe cut deep into one of the animated trees. Bark went flying, uncovering the sappy heartwood. A couple of hard blows reduced it to splinters and the tree swung and fell. The men rallied and started hacking at the things. 

It took us some time to bring down all of those damned trees. When the last one stopped moving, a halberd stuck deep in it, we were covered in sap and chips of bark. As our andrenaline receeded, the quiet came back to the glade and the men looked at each other with puzzled faces: [i]“Ho Tristram, what was that? I’ve just gained some more respect for you lumberjacks!”[/i]. Most of the evening was spent discussing local tales of killer trees, getting rid of the dead things in a large bonfire and boasting about one’s heroic role in their demise, or lack of: [i]“Mind ya, brother, but calling yourself Halfred Branchsnapper isn’t going to get you laid at the next tavern… And some might wonder if it’s your own branch which got snapped, eh!”[/i]

I was happy to trade the Baron’s head for a hefty bag of gold. Gold to pay for one-armed Gamelin’s conversion to innkeeper apprentice at Thal. Gold to pay the remaining men for their week of marching and fighting. Gold to hire two new recruits to continue our greater quest: indeed the heartwood of haunted trees has been listed by generations of maesters, alchemists and witches as one of the components of the Potion of Oblivion.

Old review from 2019:

This game is great. Darkest Dungeon meets Pit People in a hardcore-as-hell nordic/gallic low fantasy setting complete with monsters from german mythology to orcs and goblins. 

If x-com style % based hit rates drive you up the wall, you should steer clear of this. There's plenty of tactics, strategy and management involved (the world map plays like a tycoon game more than anything) but in the end poor luck with the % chances can end a perfectly played game.

But this is no ordinary G-Unit, this is mf Deified Dirk One-Finger.

The story starts with a battle, and not just any battle, a battle with Deified Dirk One-Finger in it, His Last Battle. 

See, my G from way back - Deified Dirk One-Finger - was part of a Mercernary Band - The Brothers of Sanguine.

They had been on a mission to slay a band of Brigands that had been terrorising the township, a noble mission (by mercernary standards) that would lead to the righteous subjugation of heretics and villains and restore order to the land. However, little did the Brothers of Sanguine know that darker, wilder forces stalked the land as well as them. 

The men had almost no time to prepare, a full warband of 12 Northern Barbarians rushed the men from the North, forming a hasty battle line - a crashing of steel as the men assembled.

My G Dirk from way back starts blasting arrows from the back, the barbarians run into his calculated shots, one meets the will of Dirk and collapses, his throat a bloody celebration topped with an arrow. 

A short pause, the thunderous crash of steel on steel, muscles straining as both lines fought for supremacy. My G Dirk is wildin' arrows b flyin' and he sayin' fools. 
However, there is a danger he has not seen, the small band of just 6 is facing double their number, and the open flanks present an opportunity - 4 barbarians rush at my G Deified Dirk One-Finger - they surround him and proceed wildly hacking at his exposed form. 

motherfuckin' Deified Dirk One-Finger makes a pact with  Morpheus and does some Ninja shit - dodging all of their attacks for several seconds.

Whilst dirk is literally pulling some Morpheus x Bruce Lee shit, his battle brothers are finishing off the remains of the Barbarians Savage charge - they see the threat to their brother and immediately stampede to finish off his foes. Bloodied, but no beaten, Dirk manages to survive in time as his brothers desperately hack to reach him.

Seeing the inevitable outcome, the last maniacal barbarian slashes at a falling Deified Dirk One-Finger. At that moment silence reigns, Brothers haggard at the loss of another. 

Staunchly Hamdin The Fat-C*nt (You can get a character trait that means they eat loads) walks over to his fallen brother, but instead of leaning to close his eyes, he reaches out a hand and pulls up the bloodied mf. Almost slipping, his Brothers focus their attention - and see the blood run from the stump of his finger.

It doesn't matter how GOOD you are, or how good your team is, there will be that one battle where it all goes wrong despite the odds being CLEARLY on your side. Some people like this, but then again, some people also think slavery was a choice.

This game's ""Easy"" is my Uber Hellmode Hard, especially when I also factor in the incredibly lame RNG and luck. I play games to have fun and escape, not cry tears of rage over cartoon violence. Until I can make a more custom difficulty or have more options, this is a clear waste of my money, glad I got it for half off and didn't get DLC.

Uninstall. Forever. Go into the same rubbish bin as Stoneshard and Teleglitch. Good riddance.

LATER EDIT, Almost ONE YEAR LATER: I still hate this game: it is an absolutely brilliant, awesome game RUINT by a stupidly impossible difficulty, cheating AI, and idiotic intentional bad luck. Maybe someday there will be a console commands option where I can tweak the difficulty on my own to make it FUN, which for me is the point of PC games: FUN, not masochism. Recap: Forget this way-too-hard game. I still don't understand devs like this that make a game so hard that it severely limits playability and accessability for a larger audience: these people must hate money, because they are severely limiting the amount of people who will buy this mess of a game.",1572401323,1598989676,False,4,1,0.353309720754623413,0,True,False,False,76561198056049121,318,101,125,0,125,1572400822,,

33,69968054,english,"No tutorial, no tooltips, no combat text, no clue what's going on, no fun. 

This is another example of a game that the developer never actually played outside of a development module.  The ""tutorial"" doesn't explain anything about the game's mechanics or systems.  If you're going to have a game that's this unintuitive and with nothing displayed on screen to communicate what's going on, you really need to include a manual.   

The ""tutorial"" ended up with my squad dead on the road to some spider-snail things.  Ironically, in light of the above, the death screen says something like, ""while the company is dead, lessons have been learned"".  Umm, not really.  See above.  Nothing is communicated to the player.  

Is this game still in early access? If not, I'm baffled as to how this made it out of beta in such an unplayable state. 


Edit:  8/30/20  Well, I really like the premise of this game and hadn't uninstalled it upon my initial bad experience with it.  So, I gave it another try.  Actually getting to the 2nd objective of the tutorial mission, I find that even on the ""beginner"" difficulty level, the ai cheats MASSIVELY.  One ai unit took out 3 of my units in melee.  This is just not possible without an ai uber cheat.  This is on the easiest difficulty level.  

There is an action point mechanic that limits how many actions a unit can perform in one turn.  This ai simply wasn't bothered by that, apparently.  Also, my shield break attacks were able to knock out his shield, but after that no melee hit would land (and presumably, he had some magical no-cost parry ability).  

There's nothing that tells you what is actually happening in battle.  There are little popup icons that blink on and off faster than can be recognized so I can't even look them up.  There's absolutely no feedback information on the combat provided.  You simply click move or attack and then watch your pieces get wrecked by cheating ai.  

I'm pretty sure this game is actually a bad practical joke.  Either that or the developer never played it and is completely inept at game design and coding.  

One thing I did find funny (and proof that the developer is completely incompetent and has never actually played the game) is a loading screen tip that says, ""losses and comebacks are part of the game.""  Hey, genius developers, you can't make a comeback when one ai piece cheat-kills your entire squad in one turn!

There's no medic or revive mechanic, there's not picking up wounded after a battle.  If you lose your squad, the game is over.  The only way to make a comeback after a loss is to reload.  

DO NOT BUY.  This product is simply not in a playable state.  The premise is interesting, so I do hope a competent developer takes this idea and clones it.

Further Edit:  9/1/20  

Well, since I'd bought it on sale, but not had time to play it until after the refund period, I gave it oooone more go.  Nope.  It's not ""RNG"" or ""die rolls"", it's straight up the ai cheating.  The ai will take more more movement and attacks than it should.  The ai will cheese it's hit and defense rolls so consistently that if you were playing this as a tabletop game with another human you would politely offer to let them do THEIR roll with YOUR dice. 

This game is simply unplayable as designed and implemented.  I would immediately discredit anyone who says they play on higher difficulty levels because on ""beginner"" (easiest) the deck is just stacked too tall against the player.  

It's a turn-based reload simulator.  Nothing more.  When save-scumming is the ""pro-tip"" to how to play better, that indicates terrible game design.  The economy is such that you can't afford to lose people in battle.  It's not possible to recover either the credits you'd invested into feeding them and repairing their gear or the time to get them experience.  Their are experienced recruits available....but you can't afford them because of the food, repair, ammunition costs.  

The RPG talents don't really allow you to build up a team that can handle things the way you might want.  The talents are really just flavor with certain ones being mandatory for certain roles (hitpoints for melee, for example).  

This game is just terribly designed by a developer that never played it. Even on sale, this is just not worth it.  If you do buy to try,  make sure you try it in the 2 week refund period and don't linger more than 110 minutes or so.  When you have to reload several times because of design/cheat BS, don't think it gets better...it does not.  Just more of the same, play, reload, play, reload, uninstall.

43,75227931,english,"There are a lot of great ideas in battle brothers that make it an interesting game (at first) to play around with.  The variety of weapons is plentiful and every weapon has some form of utility. such as being able to aim for the head or being able to stun opponents.  The different types of shields also offer their own advantages that make them appropriate for specific situations, and so on and so forth.  I'm sure plenty of other reviews will elucidate on the merits of it.  One thing I'll say without contest is that most of the scene writing is competent and even though by its nature it prohibits having truly unique characters, it does a good enough job of describing the mercenaries that constitute your company as being believably gruff, uneducated and brotherly.

Under the hood however is a combat engine the simplicity of which is woefully mismatched with the rest of the game's complexity.  The success of any attack of almost any nature is determined by a roll of 1 to 100 with the success threshold being modified by the relevant skills of both attacker and defender... except for a 5% minimum for both hitting and missing.  But I can assure you that after over a thousand hours of playing that ""5% chance to miss"" is going to happen about 1 in every 4 strikes, or as often as 3 times in a row.  Usually the more important it is that your character hit, the more likely it is that ""5% chance"" will just -happen- to occur numerous times in a row.  Likewise even if an enemy has a ""10%"" or less chance to hit, they'll typically just -happen- to get those 1-10 numbers they need... several times in a row.

All of my other grievances (such as the AI being able to see and attack characters that should be hidden from them, or the AI essentially cheating by using turn waiting to keep from actually losing turns to being stunned) anyone else will probably just call ""the challenge of the fantasy"" or some other apologist platitude.  Ultimately my assessment of Battle Brothers is that it's a game where you can do everything correctly, position your characters competently and use all the right skills at the right time, and still lose because the computer decided that you were to lose.  If the idea of risk that simply cannot be countered or controlled is exciting, give it a try.  It's clearly a work of passion if not necessarily foresight.

44,75226384,english,"THIS GAME!!!!  At first glance, it looks like a crappy throwback to a 90's turn based tactical game.  But oh no.  This game is DEEP!!  After a while, my guys started getting powerful, and I thought to myself, this feels more like a hardcore D&D adventure, not a cheap tactical sim.

Yes, your guys are blobs.  But those blobs are complicated.  They all have facial expressions.  Each guy has characteristics that really come out.  For example, you might have a guy in your party that's a bit of a drunk and likes to start bar brawls.  I mean seriously!!!  And then there's combat, when your guys get hit, they get covered in blood and they loose that smirk off their face.  And even again, if you wipe your opponents off the map in a flawless victory, your guys will actually come out of it smiling!  So they do look like fat little turds, but you kinda get to know those little turds, they become your buddies, they start brawls, they tell jokes, they let you know when they can't fight anymore and you have to put them into reserves!  The character system is quite complex and you forget they have no legs after a while!

So.. the story.  Well it's basically non-existant.  But here's the thing.  How many ""sandbox"" games out there just throw you into a big empty world and say ""hey it's up to you to make your own story"".  PAH.  In Battle Brothers, the story TRULY is yours to make.  Your company is driven by milestones.  For example, save up $2000 and buy a battle standard.  That's a giant flag you can carry with you in battle, and BY GOD, it hits HARD!  So you've got your guy there carrying your flag and you smash bandits in the face with it.. really puts a smile on your men!  No I mean REALLY IT DOES!  But you get what I mean?  I was playing, building up my company, getting nice heavy chain mail for my men, and all of a sudden a guy came in to a town and said ""IT'S WAR!"".  All of a sudden I was being pitted against other factions, for 5x the profit, 10x the danger.  You can choose to take those missions, or you can choose to explore the map.  Or you can choose to help the villiage down the road and find out whey their villagers are disappearing and go on a nice little adventure.

The point is, the choice is yours, and the ""open world"" feeling of this game feels more like the ""real world"", where your guys are given multiple choices on how to proceed, the game makes DAMN sure you are busy!

Difficulty:  Well the game is pretty hard.  You will have to be wise.  Don't be stupid and rush your guys into a pack of orcs.  Coordinated battlefield movements and shield walls are going to be your best friends.  Oh and spears. Yes, you can make a frontline of SPARTANS in this game.  And let me tell ya.... IT'S AMAZING!  But you have allllll kinds of choices for weapons, and many of the 2handers REALLY pack a punch.  Especially with the chained maces, where you have the head of the  mace that swings around on the end of a stick, it can be used to hit your enemies around shields, and when you go for the head and really land a connecting shot... SPLAT.  And DON'T EVEN GET ME STARTED about the 2H version of this weapon.   SSSSSSSSPLAT.

But yes it is important not to grow your roster too fast, or to make stupid choices in battle.  You will have to save.  A lot.  Savescumming is a real thing in this game, and the Dev's know it.  You might not even be able to complete the mission you're on because of a battle that you just can't win.  So you will have to roll back a save or 2.  I run my saves so that I save on one slot before accepting a mission, and save on another slot after accepting a mission.  That way I always have a way to fallback.  Oh and, the autosave system is quite smart.  If you load from an autosave, you can adjust your guys, weapons, formation, etc, and the game will save it like that for the battle, so loading up the autosave again, and your company has all the new adjustments ready to go.

But getting back to the overall lore and world building.  It's pretty awesome.  My only critique is that your common missions often come with a whole bunch of dialogue that you have to read thru, and sometimes it takes longer to read the mission than it does to actually play it through.  But some people enjoy that stuff.  I just wish the mission told you what type of mission it is so that you don't have to accept the mission 3x before getting to the screen where it gives you the shorthand breakdown.  I usually skip past all the reading (my eyes are terrible) and right to the summary page, where I then decide if I want the contract or not.

DLC's:  Yeah they are GREAT!  And it's important to get at least the one, Beasts & Exploration.  It adds a LOT of new weapons, a couple new enemies, new mission types, new music, new guys you can hire, and a bunch of other stuff.  It's 100% worth getting.  In fact, I have 2 expansions, the aforementioned and also Warriors from the North.  I have blazing deserts on my wish list and as soon as it goes on sale I'm picking that up too.

No this game is 100% worthit and it really makes you feel like you are playing a swords and shields version of D&D or Pathfinder.  This game REALLY NAILED the feeling of starting out weak and ending up strong.  I've restarted the game twice since I bought the expansions and so haven't even made it close to end game, but I've got a pretty damn strong army atm.  Warriors from the North adds company starts and they are really worth it!  Overall, I give this game 2 SOLID thumbs up!  And this is coming from a LONG TIME gamer!

After playing longer(30 more hours) I just have to say, I've never played a more frustrating game than this game. 95% chance to hit, miss, miss, miss. The enemy hits dam near every time. Enemies with shields block dam near every time, your guys block seldom at best. Necrosavants just bounce around the map so by the time you get guys near them they've moved away to kill another one of your guys. What 10 year old thought that ability would be a good idea? This game has soooooo much potential buts it's ruined by false percentages and broken RNG that rarely ever plays into your favor. They say this game is hard? No this game is flat out broken.

---- ORIGINAL REVIEW ----

Like Darkest Dungeon with more RNG, if I'm being candid. A lot of players enjoy managing insane RNG - I can't say I'm one of them.

I understand ""difficult"" has been one of the guiding stars for the development of this game, but I can't say I'm impressed. If I'm looking for difficult, I'm looking for something that's intellectually or practically challenging, not something that forces me to replay the same encounter over and over again in the hopes of getting the right rolls. Many will claim that if your mercenary party gets wiped by ""unlucky numbers"", then you haven't prepared enough. Although I understand the sentiment behind this statement, I have to respectfully disagree, because Battle Brothers forces you to take on missions in your immediate vicinity in order to survive (lest you go bankrupt and suffer irrevocable damage to reputation/economy/party strength and in effect lose the game) - especially in the beginning. In effect, this makes it extremely difficult to avoid ""unprepared"" encounters, as the availability of contracts is utterly unpredictable (as is their difficulty), so you are forced to take on what you find.

Combat RNG is frustrating in itself, and you get the distinct feeling the game is stacked against you. Not in the good kind of way, where you need to apply yourself and find the right tactic. No, just that the game wants to see you lose, and employs shitty, frustrating techniques to do so... primarily RNG. The worst aspect of Battle Brothers, however, is not how difficult it is or how it punishes you; it's the feeling of powerlessnes as you're not allowed to adapt or tactically retreat, or spend time learning about the enemy, because doing so will often mean your ruination through bankruptcy or contract failure.

It's not unbeatable, not by a long shot. Enemies have strengths/weaknesses, and if you can discern or discover these, you can play to your advantage. The AI is remarkably good, plays smart, and responds dynamically to the players advances and tactics. In itself, that's awesome. In combination with an insane RNG, it just becomes tedious and frustrating. The writing, dialogue and questlines are fantastic, as are the visuals.

There are so many good things about this game, but I have spent so much time replaying encounters, hoping for fortunate RNG, and felt like I wasted these hours of my life for absolutely nothing.

I do want to say this, though: there are certain personalities to which this game might appeal. However, don't expect to be winning any time early. If you enjoy grinding (both for knowledge, and for favorable outcomes), you might enjoy this game.


All in all, I'm really disappointed. I'm not a high-skill player by any means, but I have been an avid gamer since I was very young, and have played a vast variety (read: many hundreds) of games for over 20 years on most platforms. This was either simply too hard for me (which I've never experienced before, but I'm not excluding the possibility), or there is some merit to what I'm saying. Regardless of the reason, I hope they add an ""Absolute Noob"" difficulty, because I WOULD like to play Battle Brothers. In its current state, however, it's impossible to do so without sinking endless hours in what basically boils down to dice rolling.

In the pretentious words of the in-game tips: ""Losing is Fun"". Sure it is... if you feel like you learned something from the loss and improve yourself as a player. Losing for the sake of itself, is not... in my opinion.

---- EDITED REVIEW ----

After revisiting the game, I found that approaching the early game with greater care, you increase your chance at succeeding. Last I played, I sunk about 10 hours into the game. If I remember correctly, this added up to about three restarts. Every time, I failed miserably - and yes, it was largely due to RNG. That being said, I underestimated how unlucky I was, and I should have given it another ten hours before concluding that the RNG was insurmountable. Sometimes, you get screwed in this game, and that's okay - that's what we save scumming for!

The DLCs add more great ways to get owned. The combat is always refreshing and presents a diverse set of tactical challenges to overcome. This game WILL challenge you, even at low difficult settings, but don't lose hope like I did if you fail the first 10 or even 20 hours. Restarts are to be expected, but pretty soon, you'll begin tapping into and understanding the science of designing a strong team, and you'll experience more and more success. That takes a while though, so be patient, and don't judge the game too fast. RNG can screw you over, but there are multiple layers of complexity to the game that are absolutely not at the mercy of RNG.

AI and music beat out other titles by an order of magnitude. Major shoutout to the outsourced music from breakdown epiphanies I hope they make their mark on as many titles as possible.

The DLC are worth every penny, I'm having an absolute blast battling in arabic styled arenas with armor scavenged from nordic barabarians, tons of flavor from any DLC you chose, go ahead and splurge. 

A couple beginners tips if you'll indulge me :

Rely on spears and swords in the early game. Put those shields up. Surround enemies before making attacks. Learn which contracts are suicide missions. Invest in trade goods. Don't ignore the resolve stat.

Regarding RNG: most games have a hidden bias towards the player and the designers chose to be even handed instead, That's why people who play other tactics games feel this game is crueler by comparison..

80,75088483,english,"Aesthetically pleasing and well done, but has a extremely frustrating tactical combat with very high variation and even higher attrition rate on terms of resources. You will lose most of your units per combat, there is no consistent way to obtain combats/missions that fit your current level. Sure, you may and sometimes must retreat, but the amount of times that this is the case makes one’ work towards the progress of their warband to be very, very slow and due to the high variability of combat and the little amount of tools one has to mitigate them, you’ll most likely lose most units you’re attempting to train.

Since the attrition rate for soldiers and supplies are very high, one would imagine that one of them would be at least feasibly easy to replenish, but neither are. On most cases you’ll spend all your new finances to replenish loses and will barely make any progress. Of my 10 different games, on made it’s way to the mid to late game and this situation never ceased to be true. Building towards something in this game is frustrating and no really rewarding.

84,75080518,english,"Well... as you can see I've played this for over 3,000 hours, so it can't be that bad :)
Things I really like about this game:
- vast open world, different every time; every game really does play out differently
- interesting, often funny dialog; however, the humor never kills the flavor of the game
- so many different ways to play: different origins, gear, contracts, tactics, things to do; be a hero, a villain, a trader...
- enough in-game lore to give context to various themes you'll encounter, but no backstory to make you feel that your objective or destiny is already written
- constant surprises - some good, some bad - from random events, character backgrounds, enemies encountered, items found in shops and elsewhere
- lots of rewards and goals to pursue: build wealth & renown, complete company challenges, find legendary locations and items
- randomly generated characters with different backgrounds, names, appearances, skills, traits, talents, and more! you may hire some guys to be mere meatshields at times, sure; but you WILL get attached to your team and feel a genuine sense of LOSS when you lose somebody good... :(
- and absolutely my favorite aspect is the grueling difficulty of the game itself, which is truly meant to be played on 'Ironman' mode. For real, this is a hard game; and even experienced players will lose men at times. The game's motto is basically, ""It's fun to lose""; and I can appreciate that. Much challenge feels far more rewarding. It's realistic difficulty, especially for a low-fantasy medieval world. Come on, you're fighting zombies and vampires, orcs and ifrits, brigands and dragons and much more! How easy do you think this would be in real life? :) Do you really expect everyone to survive? Maybe nobody will...

I'll say a little about my playstyle. Yes, I've played over 3000 hours. No, I'm not an expert. I've never played on anything but 'Veteran' (medium) difficulty, and there are legendary locations I've not even attempted yet. If you want to become an expert and rush to finish all the game's content at the highest difficulty, then by all means watch the YouTube videos that show you how to go pro. For me, the charm of this game is that there is always a challenge remaining, some new tactic to learn on my own, some way to assemble the new team to be a little bit better than the last troop of schmucks I guided to their demise ;-) It really is fun to lose, and try, try again!

What I don't like about this game:
- the dialog, while fitting, is sometimes a bit... crude. For example, referring to barbarians 'arsefucks' is a little rough for my taste
- the multi-level combat takes some getting used to; it's sometimes hard to figure out what height level someone is at. The ""flat-top"" hexes do not help, as a tree or hill on one hex covers up whatever is behind (above) it. ""Point-top"" hexes would have been a much better design choice; but I digress.

All in all, it's a great game. If you're a fan of challenge, fantasy, tactical turn-based combat, and a huge amount of replayability, you won't be disappointed. On the other hand, if you have a lot of pride and think you're going to waltz through this on your first playthrough without getting massacred, or you get angry about bad RNG rolls (seriously, RNG is THE foundation of video games - they don't exist without it!), then I can't recommend you for this game :o)",1598656042,1598656042,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198089175054,29,3,185271,0,180682,1599437430,,

I've gone a number of combats where my archers never got a single hit.     

In theory you should get lucky about as often as you get unlucky, problem is the losses for getting unlucky outweigh the gains for being lucky by orders of magnitude.     Progress is far too slow to be able to afford losses of any ""good"" troops.     I just played a campaign to day 40ish (probably 10 hours of playing) and had my 3 original guys up to level 5 or so, and had never yet managed to save enough to buy one of the ""good"" troops yet.    Got hit with a fight that got 2 of them crippled with permanent injuries making them useless, and 1 dead.

It's just too much of a grind, unfortunately.     If loot from fights was worth just a bit more, it would probably be ok, but as it is, it just doesn't work.    One bad fight will pretty much hit the reset button on your entire game.    That's all right if it's only a few hours.     Maybe there are people around who have the time to invest in this, but sadly I'm not one of them.


I suppose I could just join the save-scum crew, but in a game relying on RNG ...  defeats the purpose.     I'd rather see game progress be tuned rather than expecting you to reload any time you lose your ""good"" guys.    There's no fear of loss when you can just reload any time.

3,75022445,english,"Played this game obsessively for a while, always felt like I was on the verge of having fun.  But there's critical issues.
1. Luck plays too big a role
Most of your attacks, especially early on, are going to have a % to hit between 40-60%.  While you can do things to modify the odds, your average attack is a coin flip.  Even with good decision making, you are going to lose men.  Which is all part of the plan (The title screen even warns you the game is harsh) except...
2. Losing men is far too punishing.  Bros die all the time, and with them goes all time you put into leveling them.  You may fight 20 perfect battles, losing no one (due to issue #1, this isn't likely) then on battle 21, you lose 3 men because of luck.  If those men were level 4+, then you just came out of your 21 battles netting a deficit of exp.  And if that's not enough, you almost always lose their armor.  Men are cheep, armor is VERY expensive.  Besides trying to cheese some with dagger shenanagins, good armor is hard to find.  And armor is the bar to entry for any melee bro.  

So you either hire a few bros and give them good armor and pray it protects them well enough to gain enough exp to be worth it, or you give them trash armor and they die the first time a blade swings at them.

This is why I said the game was on the verge of fun.  You lose progress all the time.  The issue is easy to solve tho.  Any of these would solve the issue:
1. Remove the reliance on RNG.  Instead of coin flip hits/misses, lower all damage and average it out vs armor
2. Allow much faster leveling.  I'd feel less like I'd lost the last hour of playtime when a critial bro died if I knew he was easy to replace.
3. Give me back all the gear from my dead bro (Assuming I won the fight) including the armor.  Serviceable armor costs 1k+ even in the early game, early game missions pay less than that.

I will say: the name of the game can be a little distracting, since it makes it seem like its an arcade street fighter knock-off, but its a nice little management sim, combined with turn-based tactics (TBT).
Much deeper strategy than most TBT games since each weapon has unique damage, skills, looks, etc. If your whole crew has 1 weapon type then you will be ill-equipped to fight any enemy whose armour is built against that. eg, spears have high armour pen, which means a larger portion of the damage they deal will be dealt to a targets health instead of armour, where as a mace will dial high damage to armour, and have very little damage pass through the armour until it is destroyed. Flails can target heads, spears can use the ability spearwall to knock back enemies that try to move into adjacent tiles, sheilds, pikes, halbers, daggers, bows...

This may be my most played game in Steam.
If you like repeat value, turned based, strategic, and a challenging one, this one is for you.
Listing the pros and cons -

Pros -
Absolute value for repeat game play - There various different scenarios for your to explore and different end game objectives.
Good varieties of enemies, balanced (for the most part), and has enough to keep you going until the very late game.
Interesting dialogues for those who like to read them.
Units are flexible, and the wide range of equipment, skills, traits provide an interesting play through suiting your needs / scenario.

Cons -
Steep learning curve, there are alot of hidden mechanics that the game doesn't tell you, which I actually kinda like, because you get to explore slowly and find them out. Or just google. Jeez. But eh, some peeps like to be hand fed, thats fine. So list this as a Con.
Not an easy game - it really isn't, even with the easiest difficulty don't expect to sail through the early game. You would probably die alot. And get frustrated. And quit.
RNG  - most turned based game uses some sort of RNG, this one does too. But some people get triggered when they miss all their hits and the enemies hit all of theirs. (They just tend to forget sometimes its the other way around).
Visual - some are turned off by the graphics, the characters are like pawns with no hands and feet, only head, body and weapons. I personally don't care and i kinda like the simplicity of it.
Length - late game battles can get lengthy.

All being said, i list some of the cons as cons but i personally think some of them are actually Pros for my self.

Original Review Feb 2017

Great Roguelike Turn-Based Squad Game, if a bit grindy at medium and higher difficulties. Three difficulty levels, and veteran's (middle difficulty) is definitely misleading - it is very hard (or the difficulty of the missions and enemies themselves and enemy scaling are poorly detailed in game, depending on how you look at it). And this is coming from some who likes X-Com 2's difficulty, and enjoys other roguelikes like toee.

After putting in 60 hours, I think I've figured out Veteran Ironman enough to get to day 100 with level 8+ characters and maybe 3 deaths of non-level 1 characters. It's grindy as it seems the best tactic is killing enemies weaker than you because it is very expensive to lose great characters.

That being said, I really like the equipment, stat, and perk system as it is very deep. Axes, Cleavers, Flails, Swords, Maces, Daggers, Spears, and Polearms, as well as other weapons, all represented. Each weapon has 2 attacks - a basic attack with a small secondary effect, and a special attack. Characters level from 1 to 11 and each level gain a perk, which each level unlocking 6 new pickable perks. There are unique items, but very rare - have only seen one that a merchant had. 

Planning out your team, their equipment, their stat boosts, their perks, and their formation are very important at medium/veteran difficulty. At this point I've probably done 12-15 veteran ironman runs, although it's hard to actually lose, it's easy to get into that downward spiral point.

The secret seems to be focusing on buying your troops great armor first and great weapons or great recruits a distant second, focusing on survivable and hit chance, and making sure they gain experience and not die. It actually was very satisfying to finally come upon this, as before this it was frequent that one battle could instant wipe you.

All in all, a good game that scratches that TBS Squad Combat itch, with good sound effects.",1487125913,1598418938,True,0,1,0.497949600219726563,0,True,False,False,76561197962100857,454,28,16146,611,4764,1601792185,,

Finished my first playthrough on beginner quite easily, bought the Beasts and Exploration DLC and now am gonna start again on veteran. Will likely get the Blazing Deserts DLC sometime as well. Missions are varied and fun, customization is pretty good, combat is awesome and lets you mess around with a lot of different strategies like a shield wall with spearmen behind them that can poke enemies on the other side. Enemies are varied and require different strategies. If some nobles send you to defend a city, they're gonna send their army with you and you fight together with them, which I thought was nice 'realistic' detail missing from a lot of these types of m&b-like games.

Well this is the game for you! Play Battle Brothers! It's a hard game to say the least, as every moment that you're alive, could be your end. Even if you have an entire squad of decked out, chain mail wearing, mid tier longsword wielding, full 12 people, and 2 pikes, 2 range dealers. You will die. You will die a lot.

But, this is what makes the game so fantastic to play. With every game over screen of seeing your company eventually disband due to complications. Hell, it even warns you in the title screen on the bottom right! 

So in the end, this game, though all the sweat and tears I put into multiple save files (No Ironman, No Life),  would I call it worth it? HELL YES! Have fun arming all your men in flails and maces, bashing skulls in, watching them run, only to be slaughtered, because trust me on this, you'd better enjoy all the good easy moments. Makes dealing with the harder ones a little easier...

Some words of advice I can say while playing this game:
-Flails and Maces are amazing early game, get some of those
-Avoid beasts early game for a while, Direwolves will eat you alive if you're under prepared!
-Be ready to sit down and play for a while, you get into the main juice of the game after a little over 2 and a half hours.
-Be sure you're ready for the contracts you take, some of them will be your last! Don't be afraid to cancel them, since you really dont want to restart!

76,74359223,english,"Let's take poker - a game of chance and skill. Now, imagine that when you play a round, there's an 80% chance that your winning hand actually loses anyway, and also that you might lose a random amount of chips when you fold. Does that sound fun? No. But it doesn't sound hard either. Because, and this is the sticking point of my review, a random chance to fail, in terms of game design, is nothing but bullshit.

EXAMPLE OF MY FRUSTRATION:
On the Lone Wolf start, you begin with one unit. When I was watching a YouTube guide about how to play the Lone Wolf start, the YouTuber said the sentence ""If you miss two 80% shots in a row, just restart, because you're dead."" Except, considering every enemy takes roughly 3-4 swings to kill, that means you're going to kill an average of 6 enemies before missing two 80% shots in a row. So, I hope you get fucking lucky, unless you want to have a RANDOM CHANCE TO RESTART THE GAME AFTER YOU MANAGE TO KILL SIX ENEMIES.

If you're looking to watch a movie where every character is zealously incompetent and dies ten minutes after they're hastily introduced, look no further! Never seen such a highly reviewed game that strips players of nearly all autonomy. In the early game, there's no possible way for you to ensure any outcome of any non-trivial battle besides reloading the game. 

XCOM famously curved the percentages so that if you miss many times in a row, you're more likely to hit. Do you know why? It wasn't because the game was too hard. It was so that you felt like you had a way to target threats. If some problem enemy was bugging you, you could focus fire, and eventually, remove the threat.

Not so in this ""game!"" It turns out, your well-equipped, battle-tested warriors can just, y'know, get their axe caught in their jockstrap or fucking whatever, a theoretical infinite number of times. Superficially, this makes the game harder, but in reality, it just makes the game *longer*. 

To the devs, if you happen to stumble across this review: When a level 4 hedge knight swings at three starter-level brigands in an arc THREE TIMES and fails to connect ONCE, (nine misses in total), while brigands gently saw at his armor with their knives and hatchets, that is anti-fun. Nega-enjoyment. What's even the abstracted fiction there? What is the knight actually *doing*? HOW WOULD IT EVEN HAPPEN LIKE THAT? To people who say I might have been ill-prepared for the encounter, I wasn't! I had the better-equipped force and equal numbers. Two of my men just happened to get killed literally before the enemy could approach (or we could approach). The last thing I did in the game was play an all-random iron-man company called the Luckless Lot which just kept wiping. Retreating is fine, but why would you keep playing a game that's snowballing against you? Everybody hates you for breaking contracts which got all your men killed, you're injured, broke, starving, like, what the fuck? This would be a cool, refreshing challenge if this didn't repeat every ten minutes.

Some people might find the graphics and design off-putting, but I personally find the aestethics of this game delightfully charming, and more than sufficient as to not ruin the sense of immersion. 

My pros and cons will have some overlap, as many of the elements that make this game what it is can be both great and frustrating. All in all, the cons are minor nitpicks.

Pros:
1. - Deep tactical turn-based gameplay, with good design and variability in enemies, weapons, armor and overall equipment.
2. - Extreme replayability, few games have provided more bang for my buck.
3. - Challenging, and thus rewarding.
4. - Beautiful retro-aesthetics (obviously a subjective preference).
5. - Engaged and responsive developers. The expansions might be few and far between, but they always add something of substance to the game, building and expanding on a robust foundation. The devs are also quick to address bugs or other technical issues. The passion they have for this project is obvious, and it seems clear that the objective is to make the game as good as possible, and not to make bank (unlike so many other devs).

Cons:
1. - The game can be very punishing, and sometimes you feel like you've been defeated by poor RNG, rather than poor tactical choice making. 
2. - Bugs. You'll encounter them outside, and you'll encounter them benched infront of your computer playing most games, this game is no exception. As mentioned above, they tend to get fixed quickly once found and reported.  

I wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys tactical fantasy games, building and improving a band of andventurers, mourning their deaths and celebrating their victories.

If you like hard turn based games about managing rng, sacrifices, permadeath, and a lil bit of grinding, Battle Bros is a MUST HAVE. Do NOT pass this one up.





This is an excellent game. The atmosphere is top notch, with a great soundtrack, an original setting (for me at least), creative enemies, and a lot of very strong writing. The gameplay reminds me of Darkest Dungeon - you take the role of a manager, caring for your party of sellswords, replacing and upgrading them as you see fit. The game comes with the option of permadeath, which is a key feature in order to experience the game properly. The combat mechanics are solid, with some enemy variety - different enemy types employ vastly different tactics. The biggest fault with the base game is repetitiveness, due to there only being 5 major enemy types (humans, undeads, orcs, goblins, ancients). This problem I think is solved by the DLC, which just includes more enemies, weapons, events, and so on. 

Overall, this game is worth the buy, and if you enjoy the base game, you'll definitely enjoy the DLC which only improves upon the game.

The main problem for me with the game is the 1d100 hit roles.  You will read that the game is rigged and does not roll correctly.  This is probably not true.  The thing is when a character has an 80% chance to hit on a d100 it is not a question of if but when you will get a string of all misses and the enemy has only a 20-30% chance will string together several incredible hits.  They should of used  5d20 if they wanted a 100 which would of evened out this RNG nightmare.

I enjoy a challenging game where if I mess up I am punished.  But in this game you always have a backup to a missed roll but you can not plan to have 4-5 rolls in a row go very much against you.  This game will always hit you with that if you play for a few hours.  It is just going to happen using a d100 roll system.  People will say that , ""you get the same rolls"", which is correct.  The problem is that the game has endless enemies to throw at me but the player has only one team with limited backups late game.  So when your team gets blown up you either start over or reload.

11,50994415,english,"I'll try to keep this quick and to the point.

The early game is a horrible experience because of game design and the RNG elements. The game seems solely balanced around mid-late game where the players have ways to work around RNG and enemy design via gear/perks you can't have early game.

Easy things they could do things to make early game less frustrating and more enjoyable early game.

1. The weakest gear in the game should be cheaper, T1 weapons/armor/shields. 
2. Things like nets should be used to make up for lack of good gear or skills. Zero % chance for recovering a net means it's just a consumable like a potion.
3. Increase the mission cash early game. Remember I'm talking about early game, pay is directly connected to renown which you don't have early game causing the above 2 issues to be worse.
4. I don't care about the difficulty settings related to the above, they do very little early game aside from more wealth start which isn't a solution.

Since enemy scaling is related to days that pass ingame (meaning they keep getting stronger) getting early losses (which cost you renown meaning cost your future income) causes easy death spirals. The recovery mechanics early game don't exist.

I love early game in most games. Kenshi for example, where you have to play it safe and everything you get feels like a huge upgrade. This game has none of that feel early game, it is a slog to get to the enjoyable content. Too many reviews seem to ignore this glaring issue with the game, as do the devs themselves.

On the new DLC
- The new equipment is a welcome improvement to QoL
- The new monsters are less welcome
- The new humanoid enemies need some balancing

Pros:
- Simple fun graphics
- Combat system very rewarding
- Turn based at its finest
- Lots of different items, weapons and armor
- Crafting system is fun
- Houses, arena and many side things that keep you going

Cons:
- RNG sometimes is really rough
- Takes awhile to learn
- No co-op, would be very fun this way but I suppose we can't have everything.

19,74753490,english,"Battle Brothers is yet another strategy title that is modern and fun yet ultimately fails to become something more than 90s X-COM.

I love strategies and played literally hours of each famous title. Be it mentioned X-COM old, new, FF/Ogre tactics, Darkest Dungeon, Jagged Alliances, Wesnoth, Age of Wonders series, Mordheim and more. And yet very few can push genre forward.

Sadly BB falls here flat. We have quite deep mechanics and weapon/skills variety to interact with each other nicely, as well as hardcore setting and difficulty. Yet they can't run from good old foe RNG based and ""luck"" factor is still playing main role, just like in mentioned X-COM and plethora of it's successors. 

It's still fun and enjoyable game by all means, that's why I bought it, play it and am recommending it. But at the same time I regret it wasn't something bigger. Because even if you can't develop very smart(and costly) AI you can minimize RNG influence with deep enough systems and big enough battles. After all who cares that your glorious hedge knight can reliably(100%) one shot peasants if enough of them will still wear him off and kill him. The systems to do so are all here - fatigue, armor piercing and mass mobs.

And as much as I can have fun despite all rng rolls(cause you can plan ahead and game gives you options to do so) - it's just not moving the genre forward. That's my main gripe cause I want AI to either outsmart me or overwhelm me. Not just RNG to outroll me as this takes away from what strategy should be - deep decision making and planning.

But I can't put it down. This is all in my experience and opinion, maybe I got good seeds randomly, maybe I got lucky through and through but I've ""Beaten"" the game after playing 50 hours of it. I went through 4 merc companies to do so. 3 of the first ones had everyone dying horribly, even with save scumming tactics, they just came to a point where it was hopeless to continue.

I've also had problems with a certain 'legendary battle' in the game where the game bugged out and not allow me to win 'The Easy Way.' I'll leave it to your imagination as to which one that is.

But for all its shortcomings, for all its lack of end-game variety (I'm talking super end-game where your company's all decked out and there's no more things to do than fight mindlessly and earn money you don't need.) I couldn't put it down. All because I enjoyed the company of my brothers. Granted, most people would maybe disregard their bros and/or think of them as mere tools, the sprinkles of story and personalities granted to them (even if it is randomly generated) gave so much character to the people you recruit. I thoroughly enjoy the narrative and writing this game offered from time to time. And I found this game to be one of the few 'xcom copy' that made me really care about these folks that fight with me.

And besides that, the challenge of climbing uphill in this game is also really satisfying to do.

A lot of planning, and learning the complexities of the game. There really is a lot to learn here. Luckily you don't have to learn everything at once, and it is gradual. However, you will pay for your mistakes and you will need to learn from them. Very unforgiving and not the game to just click buttons. Your actions matter.
Battle Brothers keeps a really good pace, once I got the basics down and learned how to survive past the first week and past the first few villages, I was having a lot of fun. The battles are extremely satisfying and, for me, are the most exciting part. It has a great sense of unknown and exploration and danger. The over-world is well done and gives you much to look for as you decide whether to see renown helping villages through contracts and deed, or going for fame and treasure in the wilds. Each new game will spawn a new randomly generated world. However you will see some dialogue, names, hires, backstories, repeated, but this is not a bad thing to me. The world stays active with hostile npcs along with neutrals/friendlies. NPCs will interact with you in the wild whether its you protecting a group of traders or following militia and other companies into battles. 
I really think this game has a lot for everyone. A great strategy game in its own right with team management and micro managing later on in battles. Preparing for travels out of battle and in battle is a must. A lot of neat tricks that can add to your experience. Learn to play the markets and other ways to make money outside of contracts and fighting. 
This is a great strategy game with a lot of details and depth. Perfect for a min-max type of players, or a casual who wants to go at their own pace and learn as they go. Definitely check out some tips and guide tutorials online, they will save you a lot of time and teach you the basics and vital but simple things that may take you awhile to learn on your own. Between the traits, backgrounds, and just the main stats you will be wanting to pay attention to, you will want to know what to look for and what does what in and out of battle. 
AND SAVE OFTEN! I think loading games after screwing up and making wrong moves in battle helped me learn a lot in game.

I wish this game based defense more on damage mitigation than on dodging, that would give more weight to the choices you make before and in the fight itself and you would have less situations where you can just reload the fight and do the same exact thing and get completely different results.

51,74694833,english,"BLUF: This is a fantastic ""make your own story"" tactical RPG-ish game in a low-fantasy medieval setting that has some of the best production quality I've seen in years, Indie or otherwise. 

If you're anything like me, your first glance gut impression is ""huh, the art's a little weird, the busts don't look too impressive, and the trailer makes it look like the animation is minimal,"" but trust me, it grows on you. You'll find the art style is actually really well done, conveys a lot of information at a glance, and really helps set the theme. 

The game just oozes quality. The soundtrack might be one of the best in gaming, no hyperbole. The sound design is so subtle and well crafted, whether it's the idle chatter or the sound of a smithy's hammer in town, or the cry of an eagle as you're marching over the open plains, or the gutteral grunts and groans as the orc hoards rush at you. 

The tactical elements of the game are really well fleshed out. There's an array of perks that hone edges of a particular playstyle, but no perk is a ""must have"" on every brother. Some brothers are destined for greatness, with strong starting stats and potential for improvement, some fill a particular niche really well, if you can keep them alive long enough to get them there. Some are just bodies in your shield wall, with nothing more to look forward to than being cast aside on your way to fame and fortune. 

But the greatest part to me is the story generating aspects of the game. If you've ever played something like Rimworld, you'll have an idea what I mean. 
Each brother has their own background, and traits, and this will shape dialogues and interactions in your game. I had a brother who was a miner in an iron mine for a local town before I picked him up, gave him a shield and spear, etc. After weeks of traveling with the company, lasting far longer than I ever expected to, I got a random event of finding him just taking deep breaths on the hilltop. He then opens up about how fortunate he finds himself to be out of the mines, how grateful he is for taking him in, and after that his Fatigue was permanently improved. 

I've had dozens of little details exactly like this, that just makes the each of my brothers that much more interesting, more endearing, which is why it's so brutal how easily they die. It's a low fantasy setting. You don't get magic. You don't get heroes (for the most part). Your early game is going to be lumberjacks, caravan hands, beggars, masons, etc, learning how to defend themselves and form a mercenary band.

It's a difficult, challenging game, but it's a fantastically made one. If the gameplay is your thing, you will NOT regret picking it up. Before long, you'll likely pick up the DLC. If you enjoy it as much as I have, you'll even consider the ""supporter editions,"" since Overhype definitely deserves every penny. It's a great product, by a great studio, and I can't recommend it enough.",1598056973,1598056973,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198035673634,477,18,10886,0,7167,1600131763,,

What I love about this game is being able to have my own narrative with my guys, roaming the lands and trying to make a name for our company. But be careful because learning the game will be really hard. Sometime you might find yourself struggling at the start, and then, after an epic fight, crawling under the loots, with a 200+ armor and helmet on your buffy boi. And sometime you'll feel unkillable, crushing every single party you can find on the field, and then, one error and 4 of your most competent boi will eat the dirt. 

Be prepared to go through both of the scenarios if you buy this game. Some people will go tell you ""git gud"" because you didn't play the META way, like going with certain combinaison of perks on your guys, with a roaster of 12 premade bois. But I find this rather boring, and I prefer to go for an organic company. And having one of your bois lose a finger or a an eye, after being mortally wounded, feel almost like a relief.

Though I do find the 2D art incredibly pleasing and well done, I understand that it's not for everyone. For the rest of us, Battle Brothers offers up an incredible challenge. You'll guide your very own mercenary company through dangerous lands in search of fame, glory, and most importantly gold. You'll mold your mercs however you see fit, and you'll grow fond of them only to see their head cleaved off by an orc or outflanked and caught in goblin nets. It will be absolutely devastating, but you'll hire some other poor soul to take his place and push on. The game is brutal, and you cannot make any decision haphazardly (especially in Iron Man). There is an incredibly diverse set of enemies, each with their own equipment and tactics. Orcs will try to crush you with their brute strength, goblins will do their best to keep their distance and entangle your brothers with their nets while they shoot at your men with poison tipped arrows, the undead will attack you relentlessly so they can exhaust your fatigue and overwhelm your men. If you purchase the DLC you'll be rewarded with even more fantastical enemies. The price for the base game and the DLC may seem steep to most, but there is undeniably hundreds upon hundreds of hours of entertainment here.

This game you HAVE to search for videos on how to play it, because it tells you nothing and expects you just start over and over again to learn. So after you watch about dozen videos how to play the game, you've spoiled it all for yourself. You just end up doing exactly what someone else does to enjoy the game.

Do not get fooled like I did, thinking it is some engaging strategy turn-based game.

This game will be insanely hard at the beginning, and its not getting easier. You will lose. Often. Only consider playing it if you can deal with that.

Here's a few thing I learnt I wish I had known at the beginning.

- do NOT do caravan escorts, espacially not if they pay good
- YOU have to pick the fights. Do not engage everything that moves.
- your company always moves faster on the map than any enemy (I encountered so far), use that to your advantage
- always to delivery missions, especially in the beginning. They are the easiest and savest missions
- do not play ironman right at the beginning, no matter how good you think you are. The game will be unfair and there will be situations where you want to reload.

This game makes me want to hit my head on a brick wall, take a sledgehammer to the face, and shoot myself in the head. There is something enjoyable about this game deep down, it feels really nice winning battles while barely taking losses, however that happens very rarely. Quite often, the employee turnover rate at Battle Brothers Co. is very high since most of the employees get absolutely fucked. It is not fun to see every warrior on your team get slaughtered, it is not fun losing a ton of money for hiring a completely new squad simply because your last team got steamrolled by some fuck-boy necromancer and his dark legion of shitlords, or by a team of green rednecks from WH40K. 

You CAN git-gud, but getting there is a long and unrewarding process, and somewhere along the way you ask yourself: ""Is suffering something I really want right now, or can I go enjoy some other game that feels much more rewarding?""

Anyways, you will likely see me playing more of this game, however, I can promise you that I only do so because I most likely have mental issues.

Very fun game.  I got hooked immediately.  The graphics are fairly simple, but work well for what the game is doing. Combat is tense and exciting.  I was on the edge of my seat for many battles, and when one of my guys connected with his Axe and lopped of someones head, I cheered.  The sounds of the weapons hitting someone is one of the most satisfying things you can hear.  I will say the only downside is that it is VERY difficult to master, and many times my whole company was slaughtered by an enemy I had no chance against.  You really have to choose your battles wisely and build up your team before charging into any old fight.

I have been looking for a ""Main Game"" that I can go into deeply and for an extended period of time and to grow with for a long time. (I have many ""side games"" that are mainly roguelike and requires no lasting commitment, just fun time fillers)

Vargus came close but it was too tedious with too much reading and a boring combat system.

Wildermyth I enjoyed but I wanted something more, sandbox. Something that allows me to keep growing and keep going rather than get boxed in by chapters and a strict story.

I wanted an adventure on my PC. An adventure I can grow with in a game that is polished enough that most of its mechanics can be intuitively learned on the fly, a combat system that is turn based and sophisticated enough to be interesting. 

It was a long hard search but at last I found it in BATTLE BROTHERS.

Lets get one thing out of the way straight away. Battle Brothers, like I imagine true mercenary life to be, is hard, unfair and unforgiving. It does not do a great job of going into the finer details of the wider mechanics and how to utilise them, and you absolutely MUST utilise them. I spent a few hours getting absolutely spanked left right and centre, before conceding I had to watch some Youtube videos to ""git gud"". Im still crap.

This game (for anyone that is not a sadist), is meant to be played on easy for the first run. Don't go buying this game, sticking it on normal and come in here whinging about how hard it is. The developers have told you, reviewers have told you and now I'm telling you. 

Underneath the, admittedly-at-times frustrating difficulty is game with depth, personality in spades, character growth and one that will make you feel all of the feels - Happiness, sadness, elation, despair, its all here.

You go from town to town, completing contracts, you know the usual, killing a bandit here, fighting a necromancer there, getting your poo poked in from some serpents way over yonder. Get cash, get men, get geared and watch some of your fine warriors get wrecked. With some wicked little events and flavour text to keep sucking you into the world.

The character system is simply sublime. Anyone that loves making builds and min-maxing is going to be in their element. All of it comes together to make you fall for the trap - immerion in the world and investment and attachment for the men in your company.

I knew I was not supposed to get attached to my ""bros"". I KNEW it was folly to get attached to the little pawns. But god Dammit ""Ulrich the Red"" a beggar from Kasierton, who started off as my meat shield and grew to be one of the most fearsome 2H warriors in the land. Who got to level 5 with some great perks and even had a little event where he banged a maid, whilst we fished her dad out of a well. Who killed 3 bandits in one battle - he made me attached to him. I liked Ulrich. He had character, he had gravitas, he had mad skills... He had his head chopped off by a Orc. We didn't even give him a proper burial. We just picked up his gear off his dead carcass and handed it to the new recruit. A drunk cripple.

Maybe I'm the one who's wrong here, but I have no fucking clue why this is so highly rated.

The base mechanics, quests, leveling etc. are all OK at best and once you get a little furter into the game, things really start falling apart.

Let me explain.

You started your new game a few hours ago and now u have lets say 10 well equipped and leveled men in your company.
Whops look at that, now you are fighting an enemy you are not yet able to counter properly, time to reload an old save or loose a bunch of men.

Great.
This game takes the player all his autonomy and freedom away and that in something thats very clearly a SANDBOX game supposed to be.

You want to be able to controll what happens on the battlefield through skill? Too bad, you can't. 
You want to do anything but grind the cycle of this game, well too fucking bad, you can't!

Here is what you will be doing in this game:
1. The same 3 or 4 quests you can get in the cities for gold/xp
2. Fight roaming enemies
3. Upgrade your troops
4. Loose your troops becuase of big brain balancing
5. Repeat.

And I'm not joking, this game has nothing else, of substance, to offer. Sure here and there a few unique quests, but these are no different to the ones you can get in any city. 
They just have a fancy new description and thats it. [i]Thanks.[/i]

The UI is fairly intuitive, and certainly if you have played turn-based strategy before you will get used to it quickly. Even if you haven't, the layout is logical. Play around with it a bit on the tutorial and you should be good to go.

The game definitely rewards proper strategy. The AI is not easy to trick and a serious misstep can mean many deaths. Sometimes a minor misstep can mean many deaths. This never feels unfair, however, and it makes the battles very rewarding when you manage to keep all, or most, of your Brothers standing.

I do wish there were also ""sisters,"" and they addressed that to the extent that it sounds like they are working on it. Right now, diversity is extremely low. Is that bad? You may not think so, but the decision to make a game populated only by pasty white guys is a strange one to me. I guess you could say its based on medieval Europe, but it's a fantasy world, so greenskins and the undead make it less historical, but there can't be women or black mercs? Granted, it's the sort of thing that would have gone sans comment twenty years ago, but that doesn't mean it would be a welcoming game then, let alone now. Alright, I'll leave that to you. If it matters to you, the game offers only male mercs with relatively little variation. (Inb4, ""but it says Brothers in the title, burh burh burh."")

The injury system is great. If you are accustomed to very specific injuries in games like RimWorld, this will work for you. Camping and healing also work well, and have appropriate drawbacks for balance (wilderness threats and expense, respectively.)

I like the game a great deal, which is why the low diversity issue stands out to me. If you are a fan of turn-based fantasy, this game delivers.

The game play is a lot like Mount and Blade, except with turn based battles.  At first glance the graphics seem a bit unusual.  You only see avatars from the chest up, which I thought maybe would detract, but it doesn't.  Actually the art style really effectively represents what's going on, and lends to a board game type feel.  The AI is challenging and clever, even on the easiest setting.  It will look to exploit holes in your formation, if a character is out of position it will capitalize on that.  The different enemy types, keep you from being able to settle into one strategy.  Some undead enemies need to be rushed, others require holding the line.  Sometimes your party is waylaid, and you will be surrounded on all sides with your formation all spread out.  Just when things start to feel a little repetitive, the game will throw something at you totally unexpected---likely the one time you forgot to save.         

This game deserves a thick, verbose, rule book.  The only negative for me so far is the rules (mechanics) of the game could be explained more clearly.  It's hard (especially early game) to understand what perks/stats work in what roles.  Making tactical decisions is difficult without understanding how hit chance, armor, and initiative work. This is mitigated by there being a wealth of information on Youtube and in forums, though it would be nice if the game came with a detailed rule book that was official and written by the developers (they do have an official Youtube channel with tutorials, but they're pretty basic).  Back in the day a game would come with a disk, manual, and sometimes a map---why publishers don't give you this in .PDF as part of the game files is puzzling.  Everyone wants to sell DLC, how about a DLC guide?

You are constantly battling the game to just have a few days food and pay for your men. What should feel like a white knuckle ride fighting your way across a fantasy map feels more like a frustrating ride in re-rolling and hoping for a better map seed.

The southern lands adds great distances between cities and if you start out somewhere with ZERO contracts, (gladiator start especially) you will be out of money before you even reach the next city to find out you couldn't get a job there either. 

The game designers made a great game, but they don't understand the risk v reward model in game design. They simply made a harsh brutal game and there are going to be white-knight hardcore aspirants who love them for it.

The community is as toxic as this game is bad in design. Any request for help will invariably include a reply that goes like this:

""Har Har! The game is supposed to be tough. GIT GUD!!!!!!!""

Any suggestion that the game be slightly more accesible so you don't constantly feel outnumbered and overwhelmed, will result in being pounded into submission.

A great example of this INCREDIBLY poor design is taking a mission - its never clear how to DROP It or what the consequences of doing so are.

One of my first missions was to clear out undead. I did not know I have to lop off their head or they simply rise up. I also didn't have a weapon that can lop off heads. 

So fighting valiantly, all of my soldiers die and rise up until the last survivor finally drops. 

It was an epic battle, but it was also the absolute end to a game that could have been a lot of fun.  Even with a sword you don't have the option to 'lop off head' so you have to just keep killing the zombie until you eventually get lucky and lop off a head. That's absurd. If I knew that was the only way to do it - I should at least have the option to target head -

But as I say, good look if you show up to an undead fight with a hammer or a club. 

Oh btw - most everyone you hire won't have ANY gear other than a sack cloth, so your start gold will barely out fit 3 beggars and cripples - which is all you can afford. No hyperbole here - those are the initial choices in your price range in early game.

If you play this game: Prepare to
Save Scum - A LOT!  

Reroll map seeds over and over because the world is wonky or the start attributes were terrible.

Want to ask questions only to have your hand slapped by the toxic gudbois who look down their noses at you.

be disappointed until you like this kind of thing.

It could have been so much more if they simple allowed you to feel like a mercenary and less like a guy trying to hire beggars so you can go up against gladiators with them.

70,74213828,english,"One of the Best and most Underrated turn based combat games out there , a real hidden indie jewel like some to not say many others are .

Here finishes the shortened review.

 Now for those who like and seek abitt more general and in depth info let me finally share some of my experiences and opinion about this great game while i remind and recommend you to take a look as aniways  most likely you have done already to some  other great and probably more indetail reviews (hope i can be escused for my more than likely bad grammar and poor phrasing at times ).

You will start as a recently named leader of a new mercenary company in a tough and unforgiven procedual generated  land in a medieval inspired/fantasy inspired  world where constant danger and death within the ranks is allways around the corner coud be said , your goal at least the basic and at the same time main one  is simple.. survive to see another day , survive while managing, improving and making the company more known, that  will require  from recruiting to manteining said group of mercenarys under your command as buying food,armor , weapons , tools to repair em etc .

From the start choices will be made : where to go , wich contracts to accept,can i handle said situation , do i ask to be paid more, do i recruit some more ppl or maybe is best to buy some armor?economize insteed for a while?The beuty is that is up to you and that many things  including combat can be aproach with a good ammount of different strategys (some in certain cases more reliably than others).The ""bad"" part ... is hard and unforgiven ,let me extent abitt on this:Contracts for example are presented and better payed in acordance with some factors as the number and lvl of the  mercenarys  in the company at the time , the reputation you have with said place as town , city etc , your overall renom and some others in cases locked behind an ambition that your  company can seek (wich system i didnt mention and wont get in detail about) , the caviat is :even beeing able to accept x contract that doesnt mean that ud be able to complete it as you coud and probably end up facing a kind  of enemy that you arent ready or equiped enought at that moment wich take us to one of the  internal questions  example presented before :can i handle said situation, as they will remind you in this world , you arent a hero but a mercenary and are solely loyal to the company  and the gold as so you are allways able to decline contracts not without some kind of penalty ofc and it is in your hands to retreat if needed in combat or to fight wether if you think the posible casualties are worth the reward and  risk or even intent to fight to the last man .Be ready as experience roamin this world , trial and error , knowin your enemy and when /how is best to face it helps alot in that regard 

Is it newbie* friendly?Well..not really but at the same time it is , while it may be discouragin for many new ppl into this kind of genere, talkin in wide terms as i belive is a very unique  well made and develop concept of its own althou its in part inspired*and gives some good vibes from other games  , and to even  many that are already into said kind of games ,it has options as campaing difficulty and if you want to play with savefiles or not (ironman), last beeing the intended way to play it  for fully experiencing the game  althou i woudnt recommend it to anybody as first play beeing better to learn abitt then and at minimal difficulty , on the very main menu if you ever get there ud see an advise about the overall difficulty of the game and soon enought ud discover how true it is .The real and final factor is are up to the chalenge? like the idea of ... thinking abitt ? do you preffer games that take you by the hand and tell you that the world is pink ? preffer to keep on playing an fps in casual difficulty for the next 2 years?is up to you but i definitly recommend  to take the chalenge and trie something new u may well like it 

About RNG .Is it fair or not? well it depends of how you look at it , the point is that it is true rng and it is not rigged or brokenas its been tested in depth many times by even people on the player base comunity so please keep that in mind and do some research on webs or existing topics before raging out loud without even looking for an answer, many people coud explain it in detail and even direct you to sources  , in my case i will simply  point a made up example as many ppl is naturaly mislead about chances: when the weather man/woman says that the next 3 days theres a 90% chance of beeing sunny and then rains on all of em .. was he/her wrong?affter all 90% chance doesnt mean 9 out of ten times but and aplyed  to this case that while there is a 90% chance of succestheres allways a 10% of failing meaning that failing 4 , 5 times consecutives with those odds isnt broken* but a wrong perception  as other games alike that i wont mention are indeed rigged using the same system in favour of the player 

In regards of my opinion in general terms and trying to not extent myself too much more hence i again recommend you that if you are thinking about buying the game to take alook at other reviews and topics about it that are definitly more detail .. i do think the game is really a great one , affter a year or a couple keepin an eye on it before finally deciding to  get it  i loved it since day one and had a blast with it, from the variety of enemys , weapons , builds , choices , layouts different kind and classes of recruits to the  fact that the developers never stoped improving the game and givin us more content affter years, beeing one of only ones that launched appart from free one some dlcs at times(affter years of not doing so ) that are completly worth it and that expand the game .

To everybody that reached here i hope you found it intursting and or  helpfull , i belive it turned out abitt if not quite chaotic and some if not many things are missing , i guess i can always edit it xd  ,was waiting to hit 1k houres to post it but felt like doing so now .Wish you are all havin a good time wether is playing games or at life in general , keep it up in these tough times, stay safe and dont forget that things can allways get worst if not for you certanly for somebody else but the caviat .) is that you can allways trie and somehow make em better",1597278041,1597577064,True,72,5,0.808991312980651855,0,True,False,False,76561197992254760,185,2,49538,0,45253,1600768639,,

82,74386383,english,"TLDR at the bottom.

It's a very cool concept. And honestly, it looks great. It WOULD be a great little game if not for a few issues that make it kind of not fun at all. I will not talk about any of the cool stuff in the game in detail as I feel that is one of the main draws of the game. I will just throw in a warning that one of the cool things is adding buffs to armor - such as sticking extra plating or whatever on pieces of armor, and that it only holds ONE. If you attempt to add another it removes the previous buff item without warning from existence and just replaces it.

It is worth noting that if you save scum (which is apparently THE way to play the game according to the other steam reviews I have seen for this game) you can sidestep the biggest issue in the game, but fall prey to the second biggest issue in the game...which is not too awful, but no the best. Also, I feel that games that are ""fixed"" by save scumming are inherently lame and un-immersive. Below I will list the 3 main problems with this game.

The biggest problem: RNG. RNG for days. Almost everything has a ""chance"" to do something. So picture XCOM and a 90% chance to hit an alien in the wide open missing as your guy shoots perpendicular to the direction he's supposed to, and you get the idea of why this is a problem. I have attacked so many times with things that have a good chance to hit, or even penetrate armor, and NOTHING ... in a ROW ... like FOUR monkeying turns. Then I get attacked by one random weak monkey soldier on my pretty geared guy that hasn't been touched all game, and insta death. Why? RNG BABY! Obviously rng also happens in your benefit, but that doesn't make it any more fun/balanced.

The second biggest problem: Grind. The whole thing is: grind out fights you can handle over and over and over to get slightly better gear over and over and over. Hire dudes and SLOOOOOOWLY bring em up to snuff. To give you an idea of how grindy the game is, you get anywhere between like 200-1000 gold or so in early missions. EVERY piece of non crap gear costs 200+. You have to pay your men 100-200 a day (about...I dunno...30 seconds game time). You have to buy supplies that come in 4 flavors, each like 150-300 per small stack of 20-25, and you go through them fairly quickly. So you end up doing this resource micromanagement, which is actually a lot of fun when you first start the game. The problem is that even when you get money and gear, you STILL have to do it. It persists throughout the game. And everything ELSE is a grind too. To give you an idea, each ""big"" upgrade you get costs 2k-5k gold. Each good piece of gear, or mercenary you hire that is on par with what you have by like 4 hours in costs 1-3k gold. But you STILL only make 200-1200 per mission. And you STILL have to deal with all those other small fees (paychecks, resources, etc). Not to mention to hit to your wallet if you start losing guys on missions. And if you save scum, guess what? Have the same fight 12 times until you win. It will change slightly every time sure, but just keep grinding until you get it! That sounds like loads of fun right?!

The third biggest problem: Content is very ""same-y"". You get a LOT of actually very cool flavor text for everything you do. But it all boils down to ""go here"" ""have battle"". Or my personal favorite ""watch your character go there (as you guard a trade convoy)"" ""fight maybe if anyone attacks but probably not."" 

Bonus problem: Being an indie game, it also has a HUGE balance problem. I was on a random low level mission like 10 minutes into the game, when a group of 5 greenskins attacked...and boy let me tell you...they were monkeying Terminators. Nothing did more than a sliver of damage to them and they decapitated any one of my guys instantly. I spent another 5 hours in another playthrough and never came close to fighting anything that tough, even later on. I guess I'm supposed to know enough about the lore by replaying the game to run from them at that point, but it still seems kinda lame.

TLDR: RNG. Grindy. Same-y. Cool concept but it's like a less balanced more boring X-COM set to a medieval backdrop.",1597556439,1597556508,False,24,3,0.541869163513183594,3,True,False,False,76561197963159700,518,51,1762,0,1763,1597539145,,

98,74340686,english,"Game is a grindy RNG-fest and the ""tutorial campaign"" is utterly useless. 

A game out of early access should not have a link to some youtube videos as it's method of teaching how to play. Nor should players have to go search for independent videos or guides to learn the tremendous amounts of things the game never teaches. Do you know what a level 3 flail looks like compared to a level 1 and why you should try to take him out first but leave the guy with heavy armor for last AND attack him with daggers only? No, you don't, unless you did a bunch of research outside of the game. 

Additionally, it is stupid difficult. Even on the easy difficulty it's clearly set up to try and be the kind of game people brag about playing (it also has no workshop support- maybe to cut down on mods making it 'easy'?). Unlike games like Mount and Blade, the game is not set up that you start weak but take on more difficult opponents as you grow stronger. Instead, from what I understand, difficulty scales artificially with time (in addition to other factors like the starting options). So if you get a setback you'll find that groups of forest bandits are suddenly a lot stronger and you can't rebuild and may need to restart. It means that if you play conservatively you can simply get overpowered by the world.

49,15878534,english,"Note: This review does not reflect the current state of the game, and some criticisms are outdated (Tilesets have been updated for example). I'll update this review when I have a more informed opinion.
Disclosure: I have purchased the supporter version of the game because I do believe in the devs at the end of the day, and this release has specifically addressed some of my biggest issues with what was left undone.

I reviewed this game a while ago, and my opinion has has changed twice. It has gone from Negative, to positive and has gone to negative again. I was really happy with the direction that the development was going, but knowing that it is no longer in early access, and may retain it's current state informs this most recent review.

This is a very ambitious passion project, and the developers did an amazing job. It is mind-blowing that the small team at Overhype has produced a game that offers so many hours of entertainment that AAA budget titles can't match. The art is fantastic, the atmosphere is great. The combat and level up experimentation are the strongest selling points for the title, but I don't believe that these positives justify the design flaws. 

The player, me in this case, winds up falling into a well packaged skinner box rather than a product that takes the player's time and effort seriously.

There are two core philosophies that are at odds in this game. It wants to encourage the player to be ok with loss. This is highlighted in tips on the loading screen like ""expect to lose a few men"" and ""losing is fun"". There are even two achievements for losing. One for losing the first time, and another for losing 10 iron man campaigns. This would be perfectly fine if not for other aspects of the game design.

1. Tips encourage the player to try Veteran mode and Iron man mode, but events, and enemy spawns frequently punish the player with absolutely no avenue for anticipation or counter-play.
  Example: maps are procedurally generated and spawns, are absolutely a roll of the dice on who gets high ground, or favorable terrain. Very often a group of 4 archers will spawn above your soldiers with a wall of protection and the enemy AI is set to turtle in every instance that it has this sort of ranged superiority. The same happens for you as well, but it's completely at the whim of RNGeezus. Some contract ambushes during caravan runs will hand you an absolute loss in the form of an enemy spawning right next to the NPC that you have to protect. 

2. It takes several hours to get a single brother to a high level, and losing a single high level soldier means hours spent trying to build a replacement while fighting against the same game world that goes out of it's way to the point of inconsistency to make itself difficult.
  Example: Most enemy armies can be seen on the world map, but there are several contracts where events force instant encounters with high level enemies. This can be game ending when you decide to take a courier mission as a non-combat option to recover from a rough setback.

The game tells you that you should be OK with losing, while going out of its way to force setbacks and requiring huge amounts of time to reach a position where you as the player can actually contend with the world.

I think the world of the developers. It is an incredibly small team that stuck to a very strict update schedule. At no point during the EA period were purchasers led to believe that the project had gone off the rails or ended. They could write a book on early access handled properly. They were very trainsparent during the whole EA period with their blog over at http://battlebrothersgame.com/ . I can't remember how many times a bug was reported and a patch released barely two days later.

I do enjoy some aspects of this game. If further development were announced, I could see purchasing gift copies or the lore book to fund the development. I just can't say ""Sure, spend 30 bucks on a game that doesn't respect you or your time"" in good conscience. Not without some serious changes in the works. 

Don't get me wrong. The game is worth playing, but the price point is rather high.

82,49342061,english,"It's a great game on a functional level. A solid 8/10. 

It's just a shame they decided orcs and ghosts were more important than the inclusion of people of color and women. I can forgive a game if it genuinely wants to tell a period tale with true historical accuracy, even if it means a marginalized group gets excluded. Even though those stories have saturated the market since the dawn of time. If you wanna make another one, okay. A little ignorant, but alright.

The problem is that these developers (and some of the ignorant fanbase) tried to bill this game as being based off of a certain historical era, and give that as an excuse for why there are only white men in the game, yet the maps, cities, characters, and majority of enemies are pure fantasy fiction. There is basically no story in the game except the one you make and the random one that emerges as crisis near the end, and none of it has anything to do with history. It's like they've only taken the husk of the era and plastered it over a generic fantasy lore. It leaves me wondering what the purpose of choosing a medieval time period was if you're only going to use it for its basest elements. 

They've also claimed that it would be too much work to go back and rewrite the in-game text to feature female text and dialogue, which sort of illuminates the flaw in their approach to this game from the start. Not to mention it's not really an excuse. They chose to exclude women from a game that features vampires and orcs and ghosts. Somehow, monsters were more feasible to them than a woman swinging a sword. You can recruit cripples into your band of warriors, but not women. That's pretty telling.

I don't care what era of actual history it's inspired by. You do yourself, the gaming community, and the fantasy genre a disservice through selective ""realism"".

Edit: With the Blazing Deserts DLC, Battle Brothers finally sees the inclusion of people of color. It's a great step forward. That said, there's still zero female representation (in a fantasy game, no less), and I really hope the devs suck it up and do the rewriting necessary for the inclusion of women.",1551639896,1597385786,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198002674594,502,64,6779,0,2878,1598146781,,

Well that's because it is simple, if you love strategy that may not sound like anything new but the challenge isn't the formula it's the execution, it's the environment, and of course its the difficulty, having good stats could change the difference in everything, but if you don't have the right equipment to correlate with your build the role wont be the same, but if the role of one brother isn't working at its best then it can put another brother at risk, and if your brothers aren't operating at there best, well then who knows what will happen, maybe a barbarian will get a lucky hit and decapitate your strongest, all because you couldn't get your shield bearer to the front line, the strategy isn't only in the battlefield, it's all over, in the character stats screen, deciding what your gonna buy, and of course who you will hire, will you hire a beggar? Will you hire a knight? Or will it be a barbarian? and of course who do you have the money for. Despite all that I said, Strategy nuts, and newcomers, I warn you, this game is not for the faint of heart, it is so so unforgiving and very very difficult, this game has the ideology that goes from rags to riches, the beginning is unforgivable and the late game is so rewarding but equally as difficult, it's a formula that's so simple but so unique and hard to master, simple enough for a newcomer to just gorilla grip it, and unique enough for a strategist to fall in love with it, this game is easy to pour hours into, and easy to rage quit and not play for a week, but this games BS is what makes it so fun at times.

Original Review at 174 hours:

The game I've been waiting for!

Ive yet to see another team so dedicated to their game, great updates that add a lot of content to the game and very often aswell. The game is not even done yet and I have put almost 200 hours into it!


In the game you travel in an open world map and go where you want to go. You can take on tasks from the local town and faction leaders and help them with their problems, be it ""Take out these bandits"" or ""Protect this caravan. You can also optionally go around looking for treasure in the remote corners of the world, in these places you will find many dangers, but also expensive loot items and unique weapons and armor.

While you are doing this, you will go from place to place looking for new mercenaries from different backgrounds. For example you can have a Militiaman who has better equipment and pretty decent starting stats, or you can have a farmer, who has higher max fatigue and hitpoints. But the interesting part is that any of these mercenaries can have up to three talent stars that make them stand out from the rest by giving them more points on those talents than usually, these talent stars are given randomly, so even a usually pretty useless merc can actually end up being better than someone from a better background.
After a while these mercenaries will gain experience and get levels that allow you to give them special perks and upgrade their talents.

The combat in the game is quite strategic. You take turns moving your mercenaries and attacking your enemies. You need to adjust to certain enemies by using different strategies and equipment.
Here those perks, talents and equipment of your mercenaries come into play!


TL;DR:

To put it shortly it's a 2D game with turn-based combat about running your own mercenary company in a medieval low fantasy world filled with all manner of beasts and bandits.

It's fun to play and has a lot replayability!


Updated Review at 470 hours in the game:

39,50705737,english,"The game I love and like!

team behind this masterpiece is dedicated to their game, just released another great update that add a lot of content to the game. Everytime they start to tease us with new update I get really overlyhyped just like their studio is called ""Overhype studios"" 

First of all: I'm not a medieval expert, but Even tho this is a fantasy game I love how they made all these equipment, armors and helmets really close to real life medieval stuff rather than some stupid fire arrows and magic elf armors with sparkling lights. So this game is Historically accurate, but with Monsters, orcs and things I don't want to spoil :P


In the game you travel in an open world map just like in Mount & Blade. But besides being the world conquest leader you are the mercenary taking part on those adventures or whatever folk offer you... of course if its worth the money. You start as nothing but step by step by taking these contracts from the local towns and cities from faction leaders and town folk and help them out. Secure the area, Kill the bandits or Protect this caravan and the list goes on... you will become famous mercenaries and you'll get paid a lot of gold and take part in more dangerous jobs. You can also just adventure around exploring the big map looking for treasures or hideouts and take em out. On the way all around the map you will face many dangers, but also expensive loot items and unique weapons and armor. And just for the bois: The random events and the choices to be an evil mercenary or good is just lovely. RPG is not perfect in this game, but its very well done! it has those Dungeon and dragons moments for example when your company men are cultists and want to sacrifice someone for greater good and then leaves your other men scared and angry then desert your company or when some of your men dislike each other and start to fight OR when some of your guys tell some good jokes about something and everyone gets eager and happy. This game just really have those moments when you get to know your men better and like them then its hard to lose them and some guys are easier to lose when you dislike them. 

There is lot to do in this game, but while you are doing this all looting and fighting you will need more men in your roster so you go from place to place looking for new mercenaries from different backgrounds. For example you can hire a beggar who will be cheap as air you breath or a professional hedge knight who has expensive gear and pretty decent starting stats and levels, but he will cost a lot. Every character has their own stats and backgrounds also traits, lets say you want to hire a militiaman instead of farmer, this militiaman has higher max fatigue and hitpoints and few extra levels compared to this farmer, but then comes the unique part this militiaman can be a coward and disloyal, but the farmer can be loyal and strong that can make a difference in combat. All of these mercenaries levels up and you can give them stats and perks usually some of them can have up to three talent stars that make them stand out from the rest, for example some of them can be better at melee or ranged or this guy has better endurance and resolve. Of course by leveling up these stars matter on the stats and by giving one point to melee gives him +1 to 3 depending on how many stars he has on the stat. So even a usually pretty useless beggar can actually end up being better than someone from a better background.

The combat in the game is turn based. Strategic part comes from the enemies and terrain. You have to think about the foe you will face and the terrain where you fight ""Will I need archers against skeletons?"" or ""Will I need axes against shields?""  
""Do I want to fight against a higher ground and how will I place my men in the terrain to make up the advantage?"" So there is lot to adjust to certain enemies by using different strategies and equipment, but here you will also come back to those perks and talents. Choose them wisely.

Summary: 

It's fun to play and has a lot replayability. It can be hard at times, but you will get used to it. The music is candy for my ears and the lore, setting and all the artwork is just beautiful!

58,68647568,english,"This game should seem like it gets repetitive, and yet it doesn't. The tactical combat is immersive. Easy to learn, hard to master. The simple story of a band of mercenaries trying to make it is simple, but BB makes it more immersive than it should be. 

The risk of perma-losing a character you've groomed for months of game time is the same sort of attachment one feels for a beloved leveled up X-COM officer. And that makes the game all the more immersive. Being able to invest in your team of guys helps make this game. 

I am definitely not one of those types to blah on about why people whine about a game's toughness because *I* do fine at it. However, I have to disagree with the thread of complaints complaining about long-time characters getting one shotted by chance, losing your guys due to luck rather than bad decisions, etc. If you think that happens too often, don't play on medium or hard difficulty of course. On easy level one can, with luck and skill, keep your guys on the thread of life, usually. Build up their hit points, defensive skill and offensive skill (always the best defense) whenever they level up (or at least until their advanced armor starts winding them too quickly and often in combat). Pick your perks to enhance their staying power like Colossus, 9 lives, and shield mastery. Invest your gold in the best armor, helms and shields you can afford and your character's endurance can manage. Plus, play smart. Do all this, and I just can't say the ""characters die too much by luck!"" complaint is valid. 

Bought this the other week at half off. Worth every penny and then some.

EDIT: I'm going to edit this somewhat after having finished my first game. The end game seemed....non-existent? My random end scenario was the apparently the undead rising. Yes, I say ""apparent"" because the game doesn't even let you know that's what you're facing until AFTER you win.

I finished a random wilderness battle somewhat less difficult than the ones I'd recently been encountering, and suddenly received a message that through my hard work and dedication, etc. etc., the undead menace was destroyed.

Undead menace? What undead menace now?

I mean, I sort of assumed the random end game threat COMING and which I would EVENTUALLY be tasked with confronting was the undead because I started encountering huge packs of them in the wilderness and more undead-oriented missions. But, there was no message or other encounter saying how ""The undead arise to pray upon the living. All is lost as their hordes start their inexorable march on the land of the living..."" and so to set up the tension and the challenge of the story. Instead, the game was like: Oh yeah. You've been fighting the undead menace against all that is good and holy for some time now. What, did we forget to tell you that, sunshine?""

Worse--much worse--not only did I not even know what challenge I was fighting, I didn't do anything in particular to defeat it. I just went around doing my scenarios until the game apparently decided after one less than average challenging fight: ""Ummm, OK. I guess you've killed enough undead over the last few weeks for me. Congratulations, you win!

To which I respond: ""What now? I was fighting the undead taking over the world? And I apparently just stopped them? Well, you don't say.""

The point is the game could've done a much, MUCH better job in terms of the end game. Actually signaling the end game menace to raise the foreboding of the challenge to start, and then maybe have a couple boss fights to (maybe, barely) survive? An extremely easy programming/design change if BB seeks to implement it, and I can't say why they haven't.

Still a very worthwhile game. I'm playing my second time around and, based on hints from random encounters with peasants and the nature of my tasks (escorting diplomats), I'm guessing (keyword) the upcoming end game is war between the kingdoms. I'm just hoping there's an actual couple of boss fights or quest lines to follow towards the end.

Don't get me wrong. I LOVE sandbox nature games like this, and my overall review remains positive. But without any realization what the end game challenge is, not to mention actually having an end challenge to conquer, why even have the end game challenge at all? As it stood, ""defeating"" the undead brought all the satisfaction--or rather anti-climax--of crossing a random mile marker on a long road trip.

SECOND EDIT: OK, I thought I'd added this a few months ago after the ""Great War"" endgame scenario, but apparently forgot. This time around the endgame was much MUCH better. It was clear what I was facing as the final enemy, and actually felt like I was actively involved in leading my side to victory. There was a major-league Agincourt level battle near the end, where my company provided our noble house allies a slight numerical advantage. It felt awesome slugging through the meat-grinder of a battle, to finally achieve victory and defeat the opposing house. I even had the painful but cool drama of one of my long-standing company members fall in battle right near the end, as one of the last un-routed enemies finished him off, just as several members of the company were rushing to his aid and only a single turn away from joining the fight. Alas, alas, alack a day!

That didn't quite end the game, and I had a few more missions plus a less difficult battle to end the war. The defeating the outnumbered enemy's desperate final stand felt cool and ""right"", though the few standard side missions after the major battle felt a little anti-climatic. Still, a rather satisfying end to the game. 

All is forgiven from my first edited review, Battle Brothers. Definitely a worthwhile game.",1588727812,1596427797,True,14,1,0.620622098445892334,0,True,False,False,76561198187008662,138,8,7396,42,2678,1601790721,,

60,73683263,english,"I can't recommend this game at 30$. Feels sandbox but gets repetitive quickly and not enough variety on new runs. Some aspects of the game feel rough around the edges (Dialogue and the same repetitive missions).

Can feel very RNG heavy at times and you will probably have to do a few restarts in order to have a good run. After you have though and you do subsequent runs it starts to feel stale fast. 

The combat and the graphical style of the game is pleasing and satisfying, I especially liked the world map that reminded of Final Fantasy 2 / 3 but hand painted and was nice. The world just needed some more variety and depth. The damage your brothers incur physically is a nice touch and the sound effects are pleasing. The music was okay at times but rather forgettable. The game really is kind of a one trick pony, it does the trick very well but that's about it.
 
 If the game was sold 20 or less I would recommend it, if you can get it on a sale you might be happy with it. For 30$ I expect a more fleshed out deeper more varied experience.

For all it's difficult features though, it does offer a vast story to explore in many ways, the ability to create your own team however you like with whatever strengths and weaknesses you choose, you can trade your way to riches and buy gear or fight and toil gathering the best gear from the bloodied corpses of your enemies and delving into old ruins hunting for legendary gear.

Pros:
-Amazing turn based combat with complexity and depth, as well as unforgiving and gruesome combat realism
-Awesome character progression and specialization yields very high replayability
-Incredible art and design/presentation
-Although naturally repetitive after a while, great music, sound effects, and ambiance

Cons:
-Missions are fairly limited in type (kill X, escort X, or deliver to X)
-As a corollary to that, the subject of the game, a small mercenary company, limits the scope of what you can do. You can't take over a towns or conduct real sieges. You can't become a lord or a mayor. You can't field a large army (although this might be tedious for the turn based combat system). Perhaps this con should actually go under ""subjective"" below.

Subjective:
-Missions are short
-The light fantasy setting may be a con to some - although it is fun and these creatures spice things up in combat, you spend at least 50% or more of your time hunting werewolves, zombies, skeletors, witches, giants, and other fantastical creatures. 
-Although true to your role as a small band of mercenaries, options for lucrative trading are limited and ultimately not worth your time as a focus. Most of the benefit of trading comes from repairing looted weapons and armor and selling them for less than what the NPC merchants can/will sell them for.

Overall: Great mercenary company sim with excellent visual design and compelling turn based combat.

The game itself is enjoyable, but too random at the moment. It also doesn't make sense on many fronts, nor do all the decisions behind its creation. It also gets samey quickly and eats a lot of time for little gain. I could recommend it before for the potential it still held, but with it being ""complete"" it is left shallow.

1st) Music is what you dont care, thats how good it is. It doesnt get in the way, it doesnt tire you out, or is annoying. Its just great. Its complementary.

2nd) Sound effects are incredible. Not just at the beggining but in mid game too all the werewolves and orcs will scare the crap out of you, they hit hard to complement their roars and its very satisfying. No game to my knowledge has such immersive audio for enemies.

3rd) Its just a typical gather mercenaries, go kill this, guard caravan type of game. But it feels so much more because you level your bros and the progression is impactful.

4rd) Customisation is as important as is plentiful here. Various builds possible and fun! Could have more, always can have more but as is, it is plentiful (im saying this with 2 dlc - without them it might be shallow)

5) Combat is great and satisfying. Heads flying, roars and grunts.

6th) The UI is what most games dont have. Very pleasing to look at and all-in one place. No bs ""skill trees"" that are in weird shapes (most games going to this stupid trend)

misc) Rain is cool, night is cool, forests are cool but annoying layouts plentiful. Dogs are cool, hawks are useless.
Might encounter crashes! Disabling fancy AA, MFAA, and many other helped me go from many crashes into none.

The downside:

- battlefield is trash sometimes. Some hills generated are as annoying as they look unnapealing!
- forum is toxic with fanboys and mods. Might be on par with grim dawn (non steam)

Even on beginner mode (lol, what kind of a sadistic joke is that?)

At least in Lunatic/Maddening FE playthroughs you get the characters coming through strong. This expects you to care for some faceless blokes (no female representation, at ALL) with no world interaction bar enemies; it sucks.

17,68539070,english,"Definitely my favorite turn based strategy game that ive played. Been playing turn based games for years and this one, at least for me takes the cake. As simplistic as it may look from screenshots or videos It's actually quite a complicated one once you actually dive into it, however if you've played enough turn based strategy games you'll probably find at least the base mechanics easy to pick up. Its the little things that even the most experienced person in these types of games, will have difficulty picking up for some time . But like any other game with a learning curve, once you've played it enough, you'll at least mostly get the hang of it sooner or later. At the time of this review I've got about 160 hours into the game and I'm still learning new things, and with the new dlc coming out (and hopefully more in the future) i'll probably still have much to learn about the game for hundreds of more hours. Constantly learning new things about a game even after hundreds of hours played is something i do enjoy about games like these. 

If you like role playing games, and you like turn based style games this is a must have. if you like those kinds of games but you don't like games like this that are hard to learn at first and have a pretty large learning curve i would still recommend it because it may just be the one that gets you to enjoy the tougher variants of strategy games you're used to, but I would say to hold off on the dlc until you know its a game you will enjoy. And if you do like it, the dlc is a must have. each dlc brings a lot of new things to the game that adds just that much more to the replayability to the game. It's Solid game. Haven't sunk this many hours in such a short period of time into a game in years. So this one for me any way is pretty special. I held off on getting it myself for a long time because the visuals didnt appeal to me at first, but i actually learned to love the artwork a lot while playing and im actually sad i didnt try it out sooner and this is yet another game that proved to me there are a lot of great games out there even if initially the visual appeal isnt there for me. And again if you enjoy turn based strategy games and rpg games but dont like the difficult factor, i would say watch some videos on it and give it a good look first, as the game has no actual tutorial, just kind of throws you into the game and the player is expected to learn as they go.

So its shared between the Master Aryan races like the Arabs, Upper caste Hindus and ofcourse our lovely white folx.
At one point in the Dev dairy for a new DLC, the Dev(s) specify slavery as being modelled on the slave armies ""common"" in the middle east. It would take a long time to educate Aryans on how the slaves of the middle east were not only people who kicked the ass of freemen but were also much more freer than european socitiies at those points could vene imagine. These ""slaves"" overthrew kings and chopped off the head of their pope and played football. They became kings multiple times in diffrent geographical areas - from India to Iran. This should inform the Aryans of how much more defiant and hiearchy hating eastern cultures are when compared to their freedom loving cultures that basically jusyt called slaves serfs. Thats it. Compare that with the Ottamamns who had to institute a regular army of CHRISTIAN SLAVES cause they were fucking terrified of the freedom and democracy hating ways of their populace. Chrisitans on the other hand were thought of as docile people who would fight all their masters wars and do their bidding as long as you CALLED THEM serfs or freemen. How things stay the same.

(But mainly if you're playing in Ironman mode, as the game is supposed to be played.)


After 106.2 hours playing Battle Brothers, I finally decided I had probably seen everything it has to offer (or close to it). Then I went to check the credits, and was impressed to find out this game was made by only 3 german guys, and written by an american... person (I can't tell, by the name, whether it's a dude or a girl).

Battle Brothers is [i]very[/i] well thought-out. There's a lot of content in it, and the intrincacies of the perk-tree, combined with the randomness of the stats of the guys you hire for your company, make it so that building your characters is a rather deep experience. Seriously, after 100 hours I still caught myself thinking, ""Damn! If I took a guy strong in [i]these[/i] stats and put [i]these[/i] perks, and [i]this[/i] weapon on him, he'd probably be awesome!"" You have to be F'ing brilliant to pull something like this off in a game. It's really cool.

And the writting is [i]really[/i] good too. I'm not sure whether Casey Hollingshead is a guy's or a girl's name but, either way, he/she did a great job, enough to make me read every single word I came across, which is something I virtually never do in a game. And there's a lot of text in BB.


[b]Cut the sh*t. What's the game about, and what did you mean by the title?[/b]

You control a group of mercenaries. Up to twelve can take part in a battle, and you can have eight more in the reserves, to use on the next encounter while one of your main ones heals up or recovers from an injury.

Each one of your mercenaries has a daily salary. They also eat, and use tools to repair damaged items, and medical supplies to heal themselves. All that happens automatically while time passes on the world map, but you must buy all that stuff every now and then because, if you run out, you're screwed one way or another.

That matters, because getting [i]rich[/i] in this game is pretty hard. You're [i]always[/i] going to be needing money. Weapons and armor, for instance, are [i]very[/i] spendy, so you rarely buy any -- mostly, you use what you salvage from the battlefield.

You start the game with 3 guys. You gotta hire the rest. And when you do, all you know about your potential employee is his previous profession, how much it costs to hire him and how much is his salary. If you pay some coin, you get to uncover his personal traits (positive or negative bonus a character may or may not have) but there's no way to know his stats or in which stat he gains more points when leveling up -- you only get to know that after you hire (and pay for) him...

... and that's one of the main reasons why I do [i]not[/i] recommend playing in Ironman Mode, as the Devs intended the game to be played.

I tried that at first. Three or four times. But when you manage to find 2, 3, 4 [i]good[/i] guys (and to find a single one is quite difficult) and level them to, let's say, level 4 or 5 (out of 11, plus extra ones that give them no more perks) and then you see them getting slaughtered in battle, you just get really, [i]really[/i] pis*ed-off and frustrated. It's a lot of work gone to waste.

And to get your entire company slaughtered -- at [i]any[/i] point in the game -- is quite easy. If, for instance, you start a battle in a terrible position, there's a [i]big[/i] chance you will lose someone, or even [i]everyone[/i]. If an orc berserker with a two-handed axe spawns and manages to get close to one of your pikemen or archers, he can end up killing 2, 3 of your dudes in a single turn. (Coupled with the randomness in mercenary-hiring, this justifies the review's title.)

You should only play in Ironman Mode if you have [i]mastered[/i] the game. And I mean it like ""after playing it for 100 hours, maybe a bit more."" And if retreating from battle doesn't bother you at all. And if you're OK with rebuilding your company from scratch, while being bankrupt, after 5, 10, 20 hours in a game. But then a late-game event will come up, and... well, it's gonna be game over for you.

There are also some specific enemies that are [i]extremely[/i] dangerous (Gheists... and Necrosavants... and Orc Berserkers... and Ancient Priests...) and can obliterate your entire company. So...

...I suggest you play it with Ironman Mode off, like I did.

Seriously, I have my doubts if anyone has ever managed to beat this game (by ""beat"" I mean ""survive [i]one[/i] late-game crisis"") in Ironman Mode, at least in Veteran (medium) difficulty or the one above. That would be [i]very[/i] difficult, or at least take a [i]very[/i] long time. And that's coming from someone who likes a challenge (and I'm not particularly stupid either, in case you're wondering).

That being said... there's more good stuff worth mentioning about Battle Brothers:

There are many different text-based events in the game, with consequences that include permanent changes to your characters.

There are ""legendary"" (named) items, which are pretty hard to come by (sometimes they show up in stores, but then they cost a fortune).

After 106 hours, there are some items (not even legendary/named ones) that I only found once -- meaning in that much time I only got to fight enemies equipped with them [i]once[/i], at random. That's really cool -- I've never seen something like that in a game before.

If you fulfill a lot of contracts for the same city/faction, you'll get lower prices for goods in it and better pay on any further contracts offered by them.

Different towns have different shops, like fletchers, armorers, temples, training halls, weaponsmiths.

You can release wardogs to fight for you during battles.

There's a lot of different weapons. Each kind has a different ""quirk"" and allows for one or two exclusive attacks, i.e., two-handed axes hit both head and body at the same time; one-handed ones deal 50% extra-damage to heads; cleavers cause bleeding; two-handed swords have an attack that can hit 2, and another one that can hit 3, enemies at once.

You can break shields. Your ""brothers"" can flee from battle due to low morale, or be injured (even permanently) -- and you can do the same to your enemies. There's a good number of different enemies, including rare ones. You must be [i]really[/i] careful about how you spend your characters' fatigue during fights. Besides wardogs, you can also release a falcon for scouting. Every character stat is relevant. World- and battle-maps are procedurally generated.

There's more, but that should be enough.

In short, the Devs seem to have implemented everything they wanted in this game, and it worked greatly.

Just deciding what kinds of weapon you're going to use is already a lot of fun... I loved it.


[b]Verdict?[/b]

Buy this thing. A ton of love and effort clearly went into it, and Battle Brothers is a really cool, and rather unique, game.


[b]EDIT:[/b]
Even though no one is ever going to read this again, after buying the DLCs and logging +200 hours in the game, I feel like adding:

1 - This is definitely one of my all-time favourite games.
2 - There is a sh*tload of event texts. Like, really, a LOT. Which is awesome.
3 - The writting is one of the best I've ever seen, in or outside of a game. The guy/girl (I still don't know which) who wrote this is really talented.",1553257453,1594923319,True,4,0,0.485091626644134521,0,True,False,False,76561198048623723,254,101,25399,0,6371,1598746588,,
39,72793600,english,"Great game, but incredibly hard!

The game feels a bit like Mount And Blade as a strategy game. You wander between towns and villages like in Sid Meier's Pirates, but as a company of warriors. On your journey you'll find plenty of loot to upgrade your characters, and as you advance there are many perks and opportunities to upgrade your party characters. The map is randomly generated procedurally, and no two games are alike.

The downside of the game is that it is far too hard for casual players or beginners to get started - even in the simplest levels. Personally, I don't like reloading old save files, but this game is so difficult that it is almost impossible to play it in iron mode from the beginning. I had to watch dozens of Let's Play videos and read tutorials to find out how to survive the first fights. It's only a matter of time when you face a larger army of enemies. And when you lose your best characters, it basically becomes even more difficult. Maybe the game will get easier when you have more experience in it - I don't know. But until you do, you should be prepared to face many frustrating situations or to reload old save games often to advance in the game and learn strategies for survival.

Still, I think that this merciless game is one of the games of our time with the greatest potential of its entire concept and possibilities. In my opinion, it might be much more popular if it wasn't so discouragingly difficult.

It's the kind of game where death is expected and a basic mail shirt is a big upgrade.  The kind where you can find items more unusual than an ""arming sword"", but they are few and far between, guarded by nasty monsters, noble knights, or being sold for more than you can afford by a master blacksmith.  If you don't have enough food, members of your company will begin desert you.  Not enough gold, same - after all, you're running a business.  You can (and should) hire more people, but you'll never know someone's stats until you give him your gold (although you can give them tryouts to see if you can ferret out their odd quirks).  Sort through men of all backgrounds - thieves, ratcatchers, farmers, poachers, militia, retired soldiers, raiders, and many more - all with different stat ranges and, of course, prices (although you can find people with a lot of talent from any background).  Different weapons all have their quirks - make sure to look closely at the tooltips for the abilities after you equip them!

The story is light and procedurally generated.  Events will fire occasionally to add color to your adventures, dependent on the background of your characters or what's going on in the world around you.  Graphics are simple and cute, and convey the proper amount of information.

The meat of the game is battles of up to 12v(some) - your company is limited to 12 on the field, but the enemy can have far more than that.  Get used to maneuvering to high ground, covering your flanks, outflanking their archers, targeting their polearm guys with your archers...

And death.  Sometimes soldiers die.  Sometimes a lot will die.  RIP.  But the Company must go on.  Until you get tired and retire, anyway.  Try to fight on through at least one endgame crisis.  If you're really enjoying it, try for all three.

Yes, RNG is an important factor of the game but that's because the game tries to force you to look at formations, the battle landscape, and other factors to improve our chance of hitting your enemy. This is true. An archer with high ground has a better chance of hitting a far away enemy. 
It is difficult, but not unreasonably so. Once you get the ball rolling, contracts become an easier affair given your experience and your brothers' abilities. Having said that, you will still lose brothers. That is fine. Don't be discouraged, hire someone to replace them, and keep moving on. The game teaches the player caution. After all, overconfidence is a slow and insidious killer. 
The only complaint I have of the game is the overworld map. I wish players were given more control over the movement of their band. For example, if you're being chased by an enemy that you cannot fight, you would try to run. However, the game's pathing makes is strange and sometimes makes you go closer to the enemy to get to where you want to go. If the game gave you the ability to take a path of the player's choosing (perhaps my control clicking and pathing out an exact route), running from enemies would be more effective and less annoying.",1594557676,1594557676,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198060364907,97,7,1500,0,1477,1594731665,,

The only thing I wish they would add into the game would be a way to see what statuses your enemies have on them, when I was starting out I stunned, staggered and dazed enemies but I had no idea what that did until I looked it up or had it happen to one of my men where I could see the details of the effect.

I do think the DLC adds a lot of cool features, and when 'Blazing Deserts' comes out I will give it another try.  It's a good game, but leaves me kind of 'meh'.

Could use more meta goals - or like in M&B if you could take over and manage your own towns, cities, castles, etc.

But that's probably an unfair expectation for this genre and an indie title - but maybe in a sequel???

I am very glad to see it has been a success.

We desperately need more creative games, as just like the movies it seems to be all going to 'blockbusters'.  I read somewhere the studios do that because mathematically they make so much on the hits, it outweighs the inevitable bombs.

--------Edit---------------
Some suggestions after 170+ hours playing,  The game itself is super fun,  but in the same time, it can be very frustrating some time. Especially the quest from nobles, Here are a few problem of the noble quests:

1, When you taking a quest from a town, the objective is always close to where you are, for example kill some monsters, drive some bandits away. But when you taking a quest from nobles, the objective can be anywhere on the map, and most likely it will be super far from you, some times you have to cross the whole map to kill 5~6 f**king goblins, Then heading back to where you took the quest, and grab a few hundreds coins. Man, That's not even enough to feed my team for the trip. 
>> Suggestion: The noble quest objective only pick targets near by, and you could collect your reward at any city within the same country.

2, Some quest is impossible to finish. For example, one time I got a noble quest ask me to stop a carriage of hostile country, BUT, the distance between its start point and destination is even shorter than the distance between where I took the quest and the carriage position, Which means when I got there, the carriage already finish its trip, And I got punished by quest fail.
>> Suggestion: Check the possibility to finish the quest.....

3, The quest fail decrease too much relationship progress, And like I said above, some impossible quest just random pop up,  it just make you soooooo mad.
>> Suggestion: Lower the punishment value.

In the end, it's just not fun at all to build relationship with the nobles, besides if you don't keep your eyes open to read all text for the random events, one click could ruin all your effort to turn them into enemies...............",1542627732,1593961628,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197976485636,96,23,11553,0,4553,1594557859,,

My first game I made the *huge* mistake of trying to raid undead ruins early-game. Everyone died.
Four games and thirty-six hours later, decked out in chainmail and better, I decided to try again. I couldn't reach the Necromancer, and by the time the Geists were destroying my morale I was ready to flee anyways.

It starts off hard as you build up your mercs but it gets progressively easier as you gain better loot and contracts that offer more gold.
It takes a while to learn the mechanics and realise what traits are good for when, but once it all clicks its super satisfying.
You start to get attached to your dudes and it genuinely sucks when you lose one of your best guys. 
Your mercs also interact with events and each other in different ways based on their backgrounds. 
These interactions are described through incredible writing that feels so natural for the setting.

Sometimes important battles are lost simply because you had bad RNG. The game lets you negate RNG to some extent with traits and equipment but there is always the chance of missing a crucial 90% chance.

68,71258692,english,"I rarely write reviews, but after nearly 1400 hours, Battle Brothers clearly deserves one. I keep finding myself coming back it, and for good reason: it's a gem of a game.

To start, there's a TON of artistic character to this game. Its fittingly gritty and cutthroat, as you're the commander of a band of mercenaries in medieval Germany that is really just out to make some coin. The art style is detailed, yet it leaves just enough to let the imagination wander. The sound effects are actually amazing--you can hear the blood splattering on the ground and the crunching of bones in battle. And the music! It's thoughtfully composed with instruments that actually make sense to have in the situation at hand... it's seriously good stuff. Lastly, the writing in this game so perfectly captures the mercenary life, and there's often something unexpected weaved in that gives you a little chuckle. I generally skip a lot of dialog in games, but *never* with Battle Brothers. There is so much thought and effort put into this game, and it shows.

And then you have the gameplay. It's a *hard* game that does not pull punches. You'll lose men to bad planning, and even with good planning you'll still lose them to the old gods of rng... A lot. Apart from the difficulty of success, there's tons of detailed strategy involved in building your company, as well as fielding it. Do you field tanks and archers against orcs? What weapons should you use against giant serpents? How do you even fight goblins that net you and proceed to literally throw the kitchen sink at you? As a contributor to the wiki, I guarantee that it will take many playthroughs before you master all the mechanics.

In closing, even if you don't count yourself a tactics gamer (I certainly don't!), if you like challenging medieval fantasy games with highly customizable rpg elements, you really ought to try out this gem. At the very least you'll get your money's worth, but who knows? Maybe it will surprise you like it did me, and it will end up being one of your favorite games in your library.

71,71240033,english,"The short of it:
+Incredibly replayable
+Each end-game disaster adds a lot of unique events/fights
+Progression in the game is very noticeable and satisfying
-RNG caps at 95%, and cannot drop below 5%
-RNG in general plays a strong role in the early game
-The Kraken fight

The long of it:
Drop a medieval mercenary crew in a low-fantasy setting where orcs tear men in half and the undead shamble from their graves all while the noble houses squabble amongst themselves over who has the biggest royal rod, and you get Battle Brothers. Early on in the game, your hardly-stronger-than-peasant crew will drop like flies to whoever it is they're sent against, and the struggle to establish battle-hardened veterans as well as some sort of financial stability will take a few playthroughs at least. This period of the game is incredibly frustrating when you're new, and a bother when you're more experienced. RNG plays a strong role in the life or death of your members here, though the frustrating moments when you miss two+ attacks with a 95% chance to hit can feel like X-Com.

The best this game has to offer begins when you finally get good equipment. Not brigand raider-tier equipment, but brigand leader-tier. A greatsword wielding giant with full plate and helm capable of cleaving head from neck in large multihit swings, or an agile former thief whose unparalleled speed can outrun man and bolt as he weaves through the battlefield with his lunges, or a hunter wielding a legendary bow that can hit any mark his eyes can see.

Then comes the end game content, where your mercenary team responds to an army of the undead, a mixed invasion of orc and goblin, or the breakdown of relations between all the noble houses, resulting in a grand ""Noble War"". With permanent destruction in the game, these events have a great deal of weight, making it so not only are you fighting against insurmountable odds with your mercenary team just to turn a massive profit, but also because the fate of mankind rides on your success, which can be a bit of a motivator.

There's even some ""legendary"" locations with difficulty far above that of the end-game battles, whose loot is far far stronger than anything you can find in the game. For the bad, though, there's a lot of bullshit. Like a lot of it. The Beasts & Exploration DLC added a bunch of Beasts as the name implies, and those Beasts can be incredibly unfair. The fights with them are either grindy or cheesy, requiring one limiting tactic used in order to survive. The kraken fight, too. That one's just bad.

But as for the other DLC, I've enjoyed what they've offered. I've sunk a lot of time in this game but I don't think it's perfect.

Basically it feels too luck based, it always feels like the computer is cheating. Get ready to reload a lot. This is the problem with RNG based games though, so it was a design choice. The early game is the hardest, and it gets easier as you play. Having said that, the difference between good soldiers and bad ones is 65% chance to hit vs 35% chance to hit, but if you can't make your 65% rolls and the computer keeps making their 35% rolls, then you're screwed. Imagine if this happened in the real world, and you saw a team of MMA fighters being beaten to a pulp by a group of children as the RNG had turned against them

A serious problem is the arbitrary head count limit, as NPC parties can have more than 12 men but generally speaking you just can't for some stupid reason. A design decision by the makers of this was that you're just going to take some losses from bad luck, perhaps frequently, if you don't like this, you won't get on with this game, your party aren't epic heroes, but might just become regular heroes, then die when they fail to escape a net 10 turns in a row due to the rng. They could have easily fixed the RNG as well, -make it roll twice and take the average to make things less ""swingy"".

Something to mention here is that the AI is on crack, it focuses all it's attacks on the weakest person like goddamn Fire Emblem, not caring if this loses the battle or someone else is currently punching them in the face, gleefully sacrificing themselves to kill one of your soldiers. Do the AI soldiers somehow win if you reload? Certain enemies are totally broken, having magic powers and such that is in no way balanced. If this were a tabletop wargame, I would be coming up with house rules.

Basically balance is all over the place, not a bad game but frustrating as hell, if they make a sequel then it really could have the polish that this game severely lacks.

One of the ingame hints is ""losing is fun"". No it isn't.

I do recall them addressing the issue saying that the amount of work required to refactor the game's writing (which there is a lot of, it's a nicely fleshed out game when it comes to lore and world building) is not worth it.

90,36054101,english,"the games fun. the game grows pretty stagnant after awhile with how the perk tree rolls. theres only so many ways you can build characters, with how it works. the game wants you to be buying people as expendable dudes to keep your vip dudes alive.  but honestly after awhile the perk tree feels really stagnant. 

honestly, i think the legendary mod will fix most issues people will have with this game. yeah sure it dosnt all work properly, but it adds all the stuff i personally wanted from the game.

cultist? has a bunch of perks that give small or fairly decent buffs that stem from resolve. 
merchants? has perks that gives you better prices on items, reduces wages. 

the mod even adds legendary perks, perks that are similar to base perks, but are either exceptionally rare, or stem from playing an ""avatar"". a dude that when dies, ends your run. 
This also includes use of low tier magic, the three being necromancy, simple magic and runestones. 

in the vanilla game, almost no backgrounds actually have any differences outside of random events that might not even come up.from what ive seen, a brawler has increased punching strength, and some have extra exp rates. nothing valuable.

 some of the loading screen hints are even misleading. for example the game likes to tell you beast trophies are valuable. except there really not, even with good trade conditions. what it actually means by them being valuable is there's a random event that's so damn rare, i've only seen it happen twice, that pays the actual value of the trophy. lets use an unhold hide for example, its value is around 1k, as written on the item. but they treat it like old worn armor, and its actual value is around 200 outside of the pre-mentioned event. 

honestly im someone that can only highlight negatives that i dont like, but i love this game. i would say the games around a 6-7 without the mod, and a solid 9 with it.

6,70711977,english,"Man, I really want to recommend this game, but I just can't. I think it has great concepts and is enjoyable in theory but there are so many features in this game that are just annoying and unfair.

Most obvious is the difficulty of the game. Even on the easiest, most beginner mode of the game with savescumming it is brutally hard, and this is coming from someone who enjoys turn-based tactical games like XCOM and is reasonably good at them. My enjoyment of the XCOM series is what ultimately led me to try out Battle Brothers, and oh boy was it an experience. A lot of concepts will be familiar like permadeath and character customization and the need to strategize to win battles. 

The issue with Battle Brothers is that for every opportunity for tactical play it provides, another feature sabotages it. For example, one of the first steps in planning out battles is to set up your units into formation. This is a great concept because you can have your line of spearmen in the front and your polearm fighters and archers in the back, and that is usually a pretty solid play. Unfortunately, you can only have one potential formation at a time and the game loves to screw you over with horrible terrain generation that makes your formation completely useless by putting half your soldier on a plateau and the other half at the bottom of a cliff or puts you down in the middle of a swamp. This isn't an inherently terrible system, though. Indeed, the need to improvise your formation on the fly to deal with unexpected terrain is a creative and realistic way to shake up the gameplay and one that I quite enjoy. Suddenly, your tried-and-true formation won't work because the middle three guys are at the bottom of a ravine. Unfortunately, the game doesn't let you edit your formation at all before the battle starts. It would be like if in a Total War game you had a singular, set formation that your guys deployed into every time and you could not change it until after the battle started, regardless of the terrain. 

Similarly, your men don't have load-outs you can switch between based on what you might be fighting, so you basically have to go through every single one of your guys (which can be up to twenty), manually switching out their weapons, armor, accessories, etc. before every battle, trawling through the mass of weapons, consumables, and armor that you have in your war cart. And the loadouts don't even reset after the battle, so if your archer had to switch to melee midway through the last battle and you forgot to reequip his bow in between fights then have fun because you're going to waste the first turn of combat (when archers are most useful), reequipping your bow or whatever primary weapon you forgot to reset.

But either of these issues wouldn't REALLY be a problem except that the combat is so brutal and unforgiving that one mistake can basically end your entire run. The game relies HEAVILY on RNG to determine its combat which would be fine if it gave you more reliable ways to manipulate it. Unfortunately, it doesn't. Most every battle I've taken part in starts with ""okay, here's the plan..."" and then immediately devolves into the two sides crashing into each other to see who is the luckier, and even if you win you're likely to take casualties. There's basically no reliable way to disengage the enemy without taking very specific abilities that you likely aren't even going to have the energy to use when you need them. The result is that any defeat is liable to wipe out about 2/3 of your army because running away is basically a death sentence when engaged in melee because the enemy doesn't get just one opportunity attack on your guys, they get to swing over and over again indefinitely until they miss.

And this too wouldn't be a problem if every single one of your guys wasn't so valuable. It takes ages and ages to level them up and everyone below level 4 or so is absolute trash, so if you lose a bunch of your high level guys in one engagement you're basically screwed because the difficulty keeps going up while your army is equipped with a bunch of rookies in tattered leather armor because you lost all of your good gear with your high level guys. This makes it basically impossible to make a comeback if things go wrong because your guys can't hit anything and die in one punch so you just lose more and more guys until it's game over. Even if you manage to get someone up to an acceptable level they're just going to die when some archer shoots them with a heavy crossbow from across the map, gets a critical hit on their head, and kills them in one hit on the first turn of combat. What makes matters worse is that you can lose everything in every single battle. In games like XCOM/XCOM 2 you can have disastrous missions that kill off your entire A-team, but the fact that you can only ever send six of your guys on any one mission means that one bad encounter isn't guaranteed to end your playthrough. You've still got your B-team and it's usually possible to bounce back. With Battle Brothers, though, every single battle is all or nothing. If you lose it's game over, and even if you win, there's a good chance one of your good guys will die, or, on rare occasions if you're lucky, suffer a permanent disability. It's like going to a casino where you never actually bank any money, you just keep putting more and more on the table until eventually your bound to lose because the game's RNG seems to be designed to make it easy for the enemy to hit you but hard for you to hit the enemy.

But none of this would be a problem on it's own. None of them are ideal, but they're not enough to kill a game on their own, but if you have a game with unrelenting RNG, unintuitive equipment menus, painful and difficult grinds, effectively irreplaceable but very fragile soldiers, all-or-nothing battles, and no margin for error it's just frustrating, especially when the game can just automatically end you whenever it likes by spawning you on a bad map, and there's nothing you can do about it. 

Obviously this sort of experience appeals to a lot of people given this game's high ratings, but I just can't. Again, I think there's a lot of good ideas here, and if you enjoy high stakes games with crushing difficulty then you'll probably enjoy it, but I just can't. Every now and then I feel like giving it another attempt but it only ever takes me about ten minutes to just quit in frustration. I don't enjoy games that pretend to give you important strategic decisions and then make them completely meaningless by bombarding you with events beyond your control and unreliable and often unfair RNG.",1592035478,1592035478,False,147,13,0.685703754425048828,20,True,False,False,76561198232872732,96,2,2228,0,2228,1590118780,,

23,70487572,english,"Well, I have been thinking a lot.

And maybe thumbs down is not the real score, since this game is so addictive and fun. This is like M&B Bannerlord, only using figurines on the board, no real fighting action.
It is very tactical, very challenging.
Played only Ironman mode numerous times.

And now, after 90 hours of testing the game, I can conclude:

The game is fantastic, but due to the amount of disbalancing/cheating - I cannot recommend it right now.
Especially this is the case when you are fighting barbarians. They can have cheap weapons and they hit like with sledge hammer. That is bad. Fix it or I personally will not purchase your DLC.

Thumbs up but some game breaking sh.it. inside

Battle Brothers offers an immense variety in gameplay and scenarios to sink your time into.

There are certainly some downsides though. The art style lacks some charm and may be a turn off for some but I enjoy it, the game does get brutally difficult even on easier difficulties, and I personally wish there was a mode to suspend mid battle and come back later.

Unfortunately it's stupid and a drain of time that can only be felt as I wasted my life when I could have been doing something MUCH better which could have been something like picking up dog poop from the backyard.  It just makes you fucking pissed off how terribly programmed this game is.  It's not just a fucking up hill battle, There is no up hill, you're just fucked.  You are significantly outnumbered on every battle, you are significantly under armored and under weaponed every battle.

I have also had to find and hire 1-10 new characters after every battle. Don't get attached to anyone of them, they will be lucky to make level 4 and then poof, dead in the next battle.  You spend your money on significantly overpriced food, medicine and tools so your party can eat, heal and fix their shitty ass armor and weapons. The good stuff is thousands of coins anyway so all you can do is window shop and dream about buying it when you never will be able to.  On the topic of being outnumber...sure you can fill your entire party up with the max number of characters (I'm not loading the game back up to see but it's like 20 or 24) but good luck with (food, medicine, tools) and not having them in just rags with kitchen knives to attack.  The attacking is also abysmal.  I am lucky if I get a connected hit 1 out of every 3 swings.

I have NEVER played a game this addicting nor this fun. Oh this game's hard, It's supremely hard, this game will kick your ass, you'll call this game names you've never even heard before. But it's fair...Sometimes. I've had runs that were going great and then i got d*cked by the RNG. Nevertheless, this game is worth it's small price. It's streamlined graphics don't detract from the experience, and also mean it runs well on older setups. The Difficulty can be tailored very minorly, which means each one is specially crafted for your preference. Instead of most mainstream games nowadays in which difficulty changes just mean, ""Heighten the enemies health, or crank the players damage down"". the catharsis of making a great company and beating the game makes losing a burgeoning company all the better My only gripes with the game are it's occasional bugs, but they usually only early on in the campaign like the disappearing icon that happens when you start a new campaign; so you don't know where in the world your company is. Just remake your company. Also, you can't customize armor to show off your company colors, just the shield, and finally; if you start as the Barbarians it's hard as all get-out to get your company off the ground, raise the barbarian difficulty meter to Three skulls.

63,70011282,english,"Fantastic game. Extremely fun tactical combat that's challenging but very rewarding. Equipping a company of mercs, levelling them up losing them,m going from town to town trading and taking contracts is enjoyable. Early on you do that while trying to walk that line between success and taking too big a risk and been wiped for it. Later on it becomes about knowing how to use your bros to bring down enemies that while more powerful individually fall apart against a strong company used right. The first time you come across Orc warriors for example they feel genuinely invincible as they ram right through you a few hours later you know how to beat them and you'll happily be taking contracts against them. The game is great at that, something that is scary and will wipe you becomes something you'll actively be seeking out for money and fun. Except Necrosavants they're horrible from first encounter to last. In short it's a lot of fun. Enemies also fight differently so you'll be using the company differently depending on what you're fighting.

The biggest flaw it has is when you're new on it's not very good at explaining how you survive it also doesn't communicate how important the economic side is. When your new early on your company will slowly disintegrate until you get wiped if you can't keep the equipment health and bro numbers steady and it takes playing to know how to do that. The game can be very frustrating early on when you're new. 

A lot of complaints are made about RNG but it's nonsense anyone getting wiped continually isn't doing so because of bad RNG it's because they're just not as good at the game as they think they are and are stung they lost, no one likes losing after all. Yes, sometimes you will be stupidly unlucky or lucky it's no different to any game with RNG in that regard. It isn't close to the deciding factor though.

I have tried with this game, now I give up.
I have played 160 hours.
Here is why I liked it, and why I stopped playing it.
THe game is challenging, the lore is great and you feel immersed in the game, the company building aspect is great.
BUT
It's just unfair, you spend a few weeks building up a company and one encounter ruins everyhting. The ennemy is cheesing you, like actually trying to cheese you, I've had an encounter with an unhold and his friend the hexe. The two of them ruined my game experience. I tried countless times the same battle and I simply cannot win against 2 opponents. They were actually trying to lure me into attacking them by repeating the same movement again and again.
The RNG will F you in the B each and everytime, so play it if you like it rough.
You WILL lose mercenaries and you'll be freaking pissed about it, as i was.
 I'm done with this game. (For now)
Thanks to Le Dank von Meme and the civil discussion I had with him, i'll try this game one more time someday and might like it by being more selective with the fights I pick. Maybe I'll save scum like a lil b**** before taking on the real challenge of Ironman.

67,69933103,english,"I can't help but give this game a negative review, because for all it's fun and interesting aspects it truly deserves some harsh feedback. 

This game is based on solid concepts, and implemented with either lazy or extremely misguided (maybe more misjudged) execution of those concepts. Being able to gear, level, and replace units is an interesting one there is plenty of room in the market for a game like this. But not even just the party-building, moving from town to town and trading commodities while also fulfilling contracts is great. The faction system is interesting, but I feel like its under-utilized, or at least took a back seat to systems the developers were more keen on refining.  The quests are repetitive but not in a way that detracts from the game, after all this is a band of mercenaries and the fetch this, kill that, protect this kind of work is intrinsic to the profession. The Mercs you hire can have either benefits or detriments up front, and you have the choice of whether you'd like to pay to see what these are before you hire them on, giving a nice counter-balance to the player against unwanted traits making a problem for your team. You can set up solid strategies prior to engaging in combat like getting all of your front line units shields and spears to set up a phalanx and then use either bows/crossbows or melee weapons with reach in the back line. Leveling allows you to boost your party's statistics incrementally (and very minimally I might add) as well as add perks that will aid them in combat as you continue to use them. And all of these are good things, all of these aspects to this game make for a really fulfilling experience, until you get to...

Combat. What in all creation is going on here? Everything in combat is controlled by chance, and it's not controlled well either. It's like the developers played Dark Souls and thought ""We can do whatever we want and no one can say a thing because Dark Souls is hard"". And yes, Dark Souls is hard, and its unforgiving like this game is, but Dark Souls isn't completely controlled by RNG, there is a steep learning curve there, but its ultimately based on the skill of the player. In Battle Brothers you could do everything in your power to prepare for fights, level your guys up, gain perks, make them defensively and offensively capable, and still walk in and have hours of work obliterated in a matter of moves and it makes no sense. 

Clearly the developers are trying to reinforce the concept that your men are going to die in battle, they really want to drive that home. You will need to replace men in your band of mercs. The problem for me isn't that the player will lose guys (though that is disheartening, I can get over it), it's the way in which the player will lose guys. If I come at the game with a superior strategy and it sends 2 enemies against my 6 defenders I'm still likely going to lose at least one because the devs couldn't figure out how to balance the way that damage is done. I don't know how many times I've watched 2 enemies surrounded by more than 8 of my men either dodge nearly every single attack, or the damage my men are doing is so de minimis the only real effect it has is to highlight the enemy's health bar for a split second leaving it nearly where it was prior to the attack. Or another scenario that I've seen all too often is a character with over 75% chance to hit, miss over, and over, and over again. Once, I counted 6 misses in a row. I realize there are perks to help with that, the problem is, even though that perk exists it should be to supplement the character not be the only way to consistently land hits when you have far greater chance to hit than you do to miss. 

The other skewing factor is that enemies will always hit more consistently and harder than the players units do, without fail. Sometimes the damage isn't a lot more, maybe 50% more than your characters are doing on average, sometimes they will 1 shot your fully armored, uninjured soldier with shield in hand. In any event I'm sure there are a lot of people who enjoy when a developer forces failure on them, some people take that as a challenge. I'm more the kind of player that likes to see that a Developer has gone to great lengths to make sure that although the encounters are stacked against you as a player that with a good strategy and ample preparation you'll over come the obstacles they set up. In short if I put myself into a spot where I gave my team bad positioning or didn't take precautions I should have with enemies and I lose a guy that's on me. But to consistently lose units because the RNG is so heavily stacked in the AI's favor as to make victory a brutal war of entropic attrition, then I don't want to play your game, and I think others should take caution when considering buying it.",1590658865,1590658865,False,16,2,0.571942806243896484,0,True,False,False,76561197996050160,110,1,3020,0,2107,1593727743,,

Pros:
Can be challenging. 
Some really funny events/text.
You will almost never get the same experience with 2 runs.
Satisfying in game moments. 
Tons of replayability.

Cons: 
Incredibly frustrating at times.
Literal fuck you rng.
Too challenging/Borderline impossible moments. 

TLDR: Dont play this game if you get frustrated easily/arent good at planning.

First and foremost god I love this game. There's tons of little details that are incredible- from the damage appearance on the characters, to the sound effects when weapons connect. The small details are part of what keeps me going in this game, and building strategies around some of the more reasonable enemies in the game is awesome!

I think the game is overall very good and well put together by now- and I find myself running a company for about 2-3 weeks in real time, then hitting a wall and putting it down only to come back and repeat! Which is nice, however:

It comes with a decent list of things that could be added/changed to perhaps make a much more fun experience and maybe attract newer people.

There are tons of enemies that are outright fucking stupid. Im looking at you Necromancers, Hexes, Shamans, and Brigand Marksmen.
Theyre not the only ones, however they can really ruin an experience. As far as necromancers go- I think the only change they need is to not be able to revive AND possess in the same turn. Especially when this comes to having a bunch of Gheists in their party on top- fuck that. Hexes are on the same tier- being able to either charm twice, or charm AND hex: Are you kidding? One Shaman alone can pretty much stop all 12 of your maxed out men, provided they have enough meat in front of them. 
Brigand Marksmen have got to be one of the biggest examples of: 'this clearly has a bullshit buff that isnt described.' The crossbowmen seem to never miss, and always get max rolls on damage, where as your maxed out archer on a crossbow can't manage to land a hit on a shieldless barbarian one slot in front of him. Yeah, sure.

I have the want to spend lots of time on this- playing it and enjoying, but theres too many things that you cannot control or thaat it simply doesnt give you enough to face. Especially after higher level days.

Id like to see a few quality of life changes (which may actually be coming here in the Blazing Deserts DLC so Im looking forward to that.) Perhaps a higher level cap would be nice, as well as an additional stat level up? (This could also just be added into a new tier of difficulty, both easier and harder. Sometimes I wanna steamroll- other times I want a hard challenge. Ive completed every event through each difficulty so.. ) There's just tons of enemies that become a straight wall, and its not really all that fun to have to pick my brain each time. 4 stats on level up could offset this: Due to so many enemies requiring you to basically only level 3 stats [Fatigue, Hit chance, and defense] yet you have to neglect everything else. Not enough to deal with a host of 13 Barb Chosen, a King, and multiple fucking drummers. Why is drummer not a playable class? We have banner-men, I think drummers would be a great option. The addition of more support classes would be nice honestly. Why do just enemies get tons of shit that we dont? (Warlord Scream.[Hello sarg rally should do the same.] Barbarian Drummer. [wtf I want this so I can actually put gear on my dudes] Shaman Night Vision and Snare (are you serious?)

Its impossible to level enough stats to fight most enemies in the game without picking straight niche fights. You cant fight Hexes if youre used to fighting Barbarians because you need to avoid the resolve stat roll in order build resistance, fatigue, and hit. Keep in mind this is not me complaining, but rather suggesting things to make the experience BETTER.

The rng isnt horrible honestly, although I am sick of missing 95% archer hit chances twice in a row.
The only RNG I want to complain about is the base stat rolls on new hires. Fuck this garbage. There have been runs where Ive gotten either no decent backgrounds- or when you do get them you get a 9k Hedge Knight with stars in ranged def, int, and hp- and sub par base stats on the ones that matter. Lol f-off. 

Overall, I think its a really good game that could just use a few minor tweaks to make certain stages bearable. Theres more to say but then it would just turn into a discussion! Would love to work with the devs regarding the actual game and I look forward to the soon to be content! Definitely give it a try, and approach the situations with a bit of thought.

1,69512452,english,"Somewhat steep learning curve with a lot of mechanics involved.  Some folks will complain about ""RNG hell"" but I'd say they're not adapting to the game as designed--characters will die, and the fights aren't always fair. 
 It's important to know that certain builds are more viable than others, and taking advantage of the environment, and complimentary skill sets and equipment, yield success...not that you won't be loading a game here and there.

Visuals are good for a turn-based game, with a unique look to the characters and creatures.  The User Interface is fairly intuitive and simple.  The music and sound effects can get repetitive, but there's something satisfying about a particularly ""wet"" sounding hit with a mace.  The design is thoughtful, and lends itself to some pretty dramatic fights, especially with the fantasy creatures such as the undead and Necromancer, or the Nachtzehrers.

DLC increases the replay value somewhat, as do the different scenarios, but this is mostly a learning experience--how to survive in a procedurally-generated fantasy world that MAY be a bit out to get you.  The experience was satisfying, and I still play it every now and again.

3,69471749,english,"Create a company, hire more recruits, equip them, tend to them. Start off with easier jobs, then, as your gear and ""level"" of your mercs improves attempt tougher challenges.

That would be the absolute ""core"" of the game, but as you might guess, things are not that simple.

First of all, you can never be certain that a low-level job will be easy. You never know when a simple caravan escort will turn into a fight for you life. You never know when a situation that feels like a certain victory can turn into total defeat.

Part of this has to do with RNG, since during a fight everything depends on your ""rolls"". Meanwhile on the map, until you ""learn"" about the different areas of the generated map you do not know what to expect at first. And like I said, a job that might have a single skull (low threat) can actually be very dangerous.

And this can be punishing or disheartening, but Battle Brothers is a type of game where you learn from your defeats. You learn about the different enemy types, what weapon/armor combos work best, how to counter certain threats, and how to manage your company more efficiently.

I would not dare say that this is an easy game, but it certainly a fun game. I would recommend this game to people who enjoy the ""unfairness"" of RNG as much as they like ""gaming"" the system. Where one day you might have a terrible time, while another you are wheeping with joy. 

And if you are uncertain, try the Demo. It might be out of date at this point in time but it gives a good idea what the core game feels like.",1589975199,1589975199,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197986250554,347,9,10356,36,6798,1600897154,,

5,69031926,english,"This game.  I'm a gamer in my 40's and these days I've gotten pretty finicky about which games I sink my teeth into.  I can think of just two games in the last 5 years that I've spent over 100hrs. on, XCOM2 and this one.  Maybe Subnautica.

I used to love RPG's and then got really into RTS and other strategy games, so this melding of the two genre's is almost a dream come true. 

There are a lot of things that it does right.  The tone is gritty, writing pretty well done, and it stays focused on what it's trying to be, which is a party building hex based strategy game.  It's all about the battles, and these are won by managing the details of your characters;  equipment, stats, and maneuvering the grid based battlefield.

That being said, the reason for writing is that I wish it was just a little more forgiving.  I've done fairly well on easy.  I say fairly because even on easy I  haven't even made it to the late game stage, but almost there I think.  I would think with 100+ hours I would have caught on by now.

The people who are complaining about the RNG factor aren't completely wrong.  This game is extremely hard, especially at the beginning.  It's really not that fun to be SLOWLY circling the same 3 or 4 towns hoping to get some jobs that you can handle and running from almost every encounter that attacks you.

It's hard to judge what you can handle.  All of a sudden a group of raiders will come along that you can't run from and most of them look like you could take down, but there are one or two guys that outclass you on equipment.  You think, maybe I can get through this if I play it smart and they demolish 3 or 4 of your guys.  Most of the time you are so low on cash that you can't recover from it and just start again.  And again.  And again.

The truth is, there just aren't enough ways to ""play it smart.""  They keep telling you otherwise, both the fans and in the game itself, but I just don't see it.  Another example, a couple days ago I finally got up to a 12 man party on easy mode and tried to take down a random fort.  Turns out they were these undead teleporter guys that I couldn't run from.  RIP...again.  

Those types of encounters I just don't see any way of handling better or surviving from.

I can't say that it's not addictive.  You keep thinking you'll try it this way or that way.  I've looked up tips and guides.  That helped, but not enough.

What would help?
1.  I think more low level encounters at the beginning.  Slimes or kobolds or whatever that aren't a huge challenge to let you fine tune and level up your party before taking on bigger things.  It's fun to level up!  We need more of a chance to grind some experience and equipment without feeling like every little group is going to require every ounce of energy to survive.
2.  Up the pace a little on the map.  Does anyone ever use the ""walk"" setting?  Maybe make a fast travel function aside from the ships.  
3.  Retreats are tough.  I see why they are the way they are, but something a little more forgiving would be nice.  Sometimes early on you get caught in a forest or something and get surrounded by guys you have no hope to beat.  There goes another group that it took you 15 hrs to build.  What if they get a free attack but you also get to move even if they hit you?

Overall, great game and nothing else like it out there.  Highly recommended despite its flaws.

I did fairly well with minimal losses for hours until I got a decent group of guys with solid armor for their level.

Then BAM, a group of bandits show up out of no where.....much better equipped, landing damn near every blow and crits like no tomorrow.

There is a fine line between hard and retarded......and these Devs sat on the ground and dragged their assholes about half a mile across that line.
My first party's death wasn't a good death, the battle wasn't ""difficult"" as my guys just got curb stomped, I learned nothing because I fucking did everything right in terms of tactics, running wasn't an option, and I don't feel like it was my fault. My only take away from this is spear wall and shield wall take up a retarded amount of fatigue. 

Aside from that, the gameplay gets a little stale and the interface is a little awkward. The character building is fun at least...but the random events seem a little off.

Edit: 2nd time around....lost the entire party within 30 minutes.  Kick the crap out of 2 groups of bandits, have my crossbow guy nailing every shot.
Then? Suddenly a 3rd group shows up.....better equipped, lands EVERY MOTHER FUCKING HIT THEY DO, CRITS LIKE CRAZY and my fucking crossbow guy who I justed gave +4 to archery misses 4 out of 5 shots....I mean MISS as in not even hitting the target.

Its literally like the game just decided I need to die.  I honestly think its the same RNG bullshit that darkest dungeon does - where the dice are rigged against you and insane odds are being seen.  If I wanted to play darkest dungeon with a cheating DM, I'd play darkest fucking dungeon.

==========
Edit: Tried hard to enjoy the game but its just fucking stupid. You have no idea how to judge fights. 4th god damn party lost within an hour and this time? Fucking skeletons...that land EVERY god damn hit and kill within 1-2 blows....up against guys with solid padded armor and maces/flails.....They just mowed right through us.
I'd get my money back but the return policy on steam is still stupid as hell, so I'm going to try a few more times to get my money's worth but the game is really getting under my skin.
Unless you play like an absolute coward, you can't fucking win with this game. That's boring as fuck and this is even on easy mode for all of this review.


Edit 2: K, well, I'm fucking done with this game.  Just had 4 experienced guys and 1 recruit with some actual good weapons - Morning Stars and 110 helmets with 70 gambersons get wrecked by 1 skull skeletons.  These are guys with the HP buff, shield mastery, dodge, and/or the gift for bonus stats with upgrades primarily going to defense/hp/fatigue.

Nothing you fucking do in this idiotic game works, play like a complete cowards for 100+ days or have RNGJesus wreck your party on level 1 skeletons.
Play smart? Doesn't work.
Bring the right equipment? Doesn't work.
Only take low danger quests? Doesn't work.
Flee from fights? Works until you run out of pay because even on easy economy you will find yourself with either a lack of equipment, or a constant 2 days of pay for your troops, or severely lacking troops.  You can't win.

I honestly want to just run a small group of 4 and do easy quests.....then get bored as fuck and quit OR have one of my guys one shotted by some trash with a wooden flail.

Someone needs to put out a workshop mod for this piece of shit to have full enemy loot to make the game remotely playable.  Its ridiculous to lose half my party fighting a tough ambush, killing enemies with much better gear....to fucking find nothing but garbage in the loot and half my old gear missing.

Edit 3:  Last attempt before I rage uninstalled.

I played like a coward, just doing safe trade caravan guarding and deliveries...saved up for HEATER shields and chain armor that was over 100 durability, even had some solid kettle helmets and nice maces.

3 guys with this gear and a bunch of archers. Was doing pretty well until we came across this one group of trash thieves.
Kicked the crap out of them, lost 1 guy in cheaper armor. Fine, fair enough.

But this one dude?? This fucking archer....lands a nice crit from afar and 1 shots one of my archers.  The rest of the baddies are dead, my dudes manage to catch up to him.

WHAM, knocked him to like 20% health with 1 mace hit. Then I move my last guy with a heater, full chain and a solid helmet up to him.....the guy who has done nothing but take defense, fatigue, and health...as well as colossus, gifted, and shield mastery.

He gets to the archer...ends his turn.....the archer takes his turn next.....Stabs my guy once for 80% of his health....with a tiny dagger.....injured no less.....SURROUNDED TOO.....
Then, he makes a second stab and finishes him off.

I just alt tabbed, closed, and uninstalled.  How the fuck does an injured and surrounded trash mob 2 shot a guy with a solid helm, CHAINMAIL AND A FUCKING HEATER???

To add icing to the cake....somehow the guy who got killed has his armor and shield get up and walk off while we were looting.  No idea where a full suit of chainmail wanders off too but it sure as fuck didn't stay on my guy's corpse.  ~3k gold down the drain.

Who knows? Maybe we threw it out because it had a dagger sized hole in it. The heater too I imagine.  You know...because we can repair a shield split in half and a completely ruined padded armor..but the heater and shield that some archer (who had to look like Quagmire from Family guy after discovering the internet) shoved his dagger through? Nah, we threw that shit out because it has to be cursed or something.

31,69046781,english,"Addictive...at first...but ultimately too f*cking unfair and annoying to continue playing.  It got almost 200 hours from my save-scumming through RNG.  Now I have full party, max number of allowed warriors all Level 11+, a few bowmen but most are 2-hand weapon juggernauts with full Plate 300+ Body, 300+ Head.  

What do I get for all this effort making the most badass walking tank mercenaries plowing across the face of the map?  A f*cking random Orc with a low level Orc weapon who bypasses all that armor and one-hit kills me.  WHAT THE F*CK IS THE POINT?!?  

I wouldn't have lasted this long if I weren't reloading saves constantly.  The world's difficulty perpetually increases whether you are winning or not...even if you lost your whole party in one bad fight and are starting again with a few new level 1 mercenaries.  Get ready to have a wild group of Barbarians, Alps, Schrats, or Necrosavants ambush you left and right.  Don't even bother trying, you might as well restart the entire campaign at this point.  

F*ck this imbalanced game.  Fake probability that is always weighted in the enemies favor.  Your 70% chance to hit when targeting a character is a f*cking lie.  It's actually closer to 20%.  Surprise!  Your enemies have about 95% chance to hit you though.  Fun times.  

Finally, don't bother trying to ask for help in any online forum for this game.  It's fans are some of the most insecure, toxic, jump-down-your-throat-for-any-criticism neckbeards I have ever found.

If I get the nerve to savescum some more and progress a bit, I might play more as it does have its merits and fun factor.  

Edit:  Look.  I changed my mind and recommend this game because it at times is really fun and really addictive.  I wouldn't have put almost 200 hours if it was complete sh*t.

33,69089018,english,"So, even though the game has amazing artstyle, music and gameplay, I literally cannot play the game on any difficulty above easy as the rng makes starting almost impossible. Surround an enemy with 80 percent chances to hit? Easy right? Only to have your team wiff all but two hits and then the same enemy landing a head shot and instantly killing one of your party members, making them all route and then die. Have a hedgeknight? Don't worry about his stupid high hit chance or armor or equipment, 7 brigands will just consistantly land 20-30 percent chance hits on him despite his melee defense, on higher ground, and killing 2 of them. Easy prey for the brigands. This stupid system makes strategy almost worthless in the start of the game, as any strategy, guide or online tutorial can be negated by surprise giant spiders, overwhelming raiders, or brigands who just decide to hit everything and kill you despite your positioning or formation. It makes any semblance of strategy feel absolutley worthless, beyond XCOM levels of stupid, and that is just on normal and above. 
A normal and above game will look like this basically. Spawn in with whatever background, level them up with starting levels, try to get them basic equipment, maybe hire one or two scrubs to help with that shield wall. Get easiest mission which is to hunt down brigands who stole an item. (Usually 7 low tier brigands with low morale, armor, and weapons). Set up your better troops in a shield wall or if its a different background, your knights or whoever into a better position. Kill one or 2 before one of them hits every attack on a 30 percent. Kills one party member. Party now wavering. Miss that same brigand with a 75 or above. His buddy with the 2-hander one hits another. 3 party member fleeing when surrounded, last guy gets surrounded and murdered. Congrats, you just died on day two.

During the battles the game switches to a deep strategic turn-based combat system, where you really have to make good use of your soliders individual skills, equipment and formations.


Pros (+)

+ The battle system, while looking relative slow and simplistic, shines with it's deep and complex mechanics where every soldier, every equipment piece and every step has in impact on the outcome of battle

+ The soundtrack (especially the Northern-DLC one) really fits the different regional settings and helps to immerse yourself

+ The equipment & skill system feels deep and gives you a lot of options to customize your different men. You really get the feeling of knowing each of your characters and when one of them dies in combat, it goes right into the feels :(

+ The small german dev team is showing that they are listening to their player base by releasing new DLCs with gameplay elements the player base asked for in the past



Neutral (>)

> The price is okay for the amount of content you get

> There is a modding community (though there are no modding tools) which is active and really add some special elements to the game (Legends Mod is the largest & most complex one)

> The game is really challenging. The learning curve is steep and you need quite a bit of ambition to delve into the game

> The visuals of the game are simple but detailed. I think they fit really well but for some people they might look off-putting



Negative (-)

- There could be better ways to teach new players how to play the game and proper tutorials. Since release of the game there was enough time to add something like that a proper tutorial. But the devs rely on their player base to make ""youtube tutorials""

- The contract system is really barebones. You take ""quests"" in the city hubs and go out to kill or scout something. There could be more complex and exciting quests or even quest lines to breath some more life into the game world / immersion


Overall: I can really recommend buying this game for people who are willing to put some effort and time into getting used to the game mechanics w/o relying on a proper ingame tutorial. If you like deep strategic turn-based combat and RPG elements in a low-fantasy medieval setting, this is the right game for you. With each new DLC the devs are adding important features to the game.

I originally gave a negative review (see below) because of the very strange technical discrepances of the game. After I updated my computer (same hardware still) from Windows 7 to Windows 10 most of the technical problems vanished. I'm sure that the save games are still easy to corrupt, but as the game crashes no more I no more suffer from this problem. I still hope that the developers will solve this issue in the near future to limit the player frustration just to the hard game play ;-)

Original Review:
I really would like to give the game a positive review. 

I like the graphics, the style, the gameplay... honestly I can barely think of anything about the game itself that I don't like (ok, it would have been cool to raise the armor system complexity by splitting slash, piercing and blunt damage).

Why then a negative review? Because the developers have managed to flaw my fun with this game with technical issues:

- Firstly the game takes at my computer about 5 minutes to start... not a high end PC but SSD and 16GB RAM should be normally enough for this kind of game. Ok, I could handle this...

- Secondly the game sometime crashes, not very often but sometimes. Ok, this I could stand also...

- Finally the developers managed to construct their savegames in a way that they are fairly easily corrupted. I love to play strategic games in Ironman Mode, and I had this problem with no other game yet. Also with other Indy games like Xenonauts etc... It's really ok to play a hard game and to start 20... 30... times from scratch and to learn more for the next run. But to loose dozen of game hours again and again (more than 6 times until now) because of a corrupted save game... that is just annoying. And no, I have no active antivirus programm, I have activated and deactivated cloud saving and everything... Everything you can find as a solution in the forums. It just maddens me that the savegame files are not designed in a better way. It can't be so hard to have redundant data storage in the file and to overwrite the ""old"" savegame only after the new data have been recorded and validated. I don't want to play Ironman mode and have to leave every x hours the game to copy the savegame file manually to a backup folder just to be sure... :-/

You really developed a really good game, and I know that you are surely a small team and don't have a big team. But I really don't understand why such basic technical issues are not propperly programmed. A game that is hard to master and maddens you is fine and good.... but to get mad because of technical flaws additionally... that is to much.

Please get the technical issues propperly fixed and I would be more than glad to give this game a positive review.",1585207257,1588920758,True,0,0,0.462224841117858887,0,True,False,False,76561198006888869,513,3,13191,272,10757,1602090149,,

It went on sale for half price, so I finally copped, along with both DLCs, which brought the price to just over that of the base game's normal price. I consider it to be a completely worthwhile purchase. This game has me obsessed. 

I've ""completed"" one playthrough, with economic and combat difficulties set to Veteran, against the recommendation of the devs for one's first playthrough. I opted not to tick the box for Ironman mode, allowing me to save scum my way through to the conclusion of the late-game crisis, which came and went with utter indifference to my participation, whereupon I was given the choice of retiring that company or continuing to play on, with the expectation of the other two late-game crisis options arriving in a random order. I decided I had agonized enough over my rather poorly spec'd cultist mercenaries, and let go of that file and started a new one on ironman mode. Then another one, then another, until I relented and decided to try ironman mode on beginner, since even after 100 hours I still feel like one. I finally got a good start last night on the poachers origin, then rage quit when in my sleep deprived state I got sloppy and lost one of my best guys in a fight against an inferior force. In Ironman mode, quitting during a battle means retiring, so it turns your rage quits in to something much more momentous and sobering.

I'm now going to give it yet another go at a new poacher origins company, as getting kills with the bow is supremely satisfying.

It's simply a pretty seamless experience, and I love that. Maybe you love that too.

Wish list:
Button to change preset equipment (less clickity clack). Might be there, haven't seen it yet.
Ability to add another random seed to existing realm extending the map when late gme threshold is reached.
Music is super dope, but I want MOAAR.
I've barely scratched the surface, but if there isn't a way maybe create one instance where a char can respec.
Again, maybe haven't seen option-> let me extend the length of the turn order animation bar on the bottom.
Again, maybe not far enough in game, but where are the damn horses! I can get a cart but no horse? = )

I had a bunch more random things, but i'm only 17 hours in from a speculative future of 150 hours.

89,68531905,english,"This is hard to write, because this game is absolutely awesome!

There are many ways to approach different situations, and the game will punish you severely for any wrong step. Combat is impactful, with fantastic sound design, a minimalist art style, and subtle animation that really pops. You can see at a glance how each of your Brothers is at any second by the blood on their face and armour denting or breaking off entirely. Every contract that you sign carries weight as backing out of it will effect your reputation, and the money that you don't earn is money you can't use to recruit new brothers, purchase equipment, supplies, and food, which in turn makes future contracts even more challenging. Preparation, planning, and strategy are key to completing contracts. When you pull it off, it feels great. But there is one foe that will always hound your steps, no matter how prepared, geared, and fearsome you are... and that foe is:

RNG.

Very few games have left me cheering at the end of a hard fought battle, my Brothers standing triumphant over the vanquished foe. But at the same time, very few games have left me so utterly frustrated. Your enemies will land 5 arrow hits in a row on men in cover, in linked shield walls, at night. You will miss 4 attacks in a row with a hit chance 55%. As much as I tried to grit my teeth, carry on through the adversity, and overcome any obstacles the game threw in my way, it just felt like it all came down to the RNG gods. And that, my friends, is why I cannot recommend this game. The deep tactical system is wonderful, but your tactics mean nothing at the end of the day. Luck is the ultimate decider, and I just can't get behind that.

I am absolutely going to keep coming back to this game because I'm a sucker for punishment, and if you love the grind and a hardcore challenge, pick this game up.

22,68284099,english,"I'm a big fan of turn-based strategy games and I've heard good things about this one, but I just can't bring myself to like it.

My primary issue with the game is that its difficulty is based almost entirely on knowledge and not strategy. The outcome of the front-line scrum is determined more by whether you entered the battle with the right weapons and good enough mercenaries than any tactical maneuvering. In fact, the game straight up teaches you this in the tutorial, encouraging you to flee from battles if it looks like you're outmatched. The end result is a game which tests your knowledge of the game through your ability to evaluate encounters rather than strategic thinking.

It doesn't help that the mercenaries feel brutally uninteresting. Characters have backgrounds that determine their stats within certain boundaries and occasionally come with traits that grant slight bonuses or penalties. Outside of these slight number differences and whatever weapons and armor you decide to give them, they're all identical: same talent trees, same equipment options. While talent choices do start to differentiate characters, it can take three or four levels before characters feel even remotely different and even then one melee man is going to feel extremely similar to another.

I'm also not a fan of how a pretty big chunk of the characters within the game aren't very viable as anything more than a meat shield, or worse. I can appreciate how a random farmhand isn't going to be as capable in combat out of the gate as a city guard, but investing any amount of time or grinding into characters who will almost inevitably die is irritating. Heck, it's very appropriate to care more about the fate of the gear your random farmhand is wearing than his life. 

While pieces of those issues could be fine in the right circumstances, when you put them all together it creates a final thing I find unacceptable: grinding. Misjudge the strength of an opposing force? Have fun grinding up six new mercs! Level up a unit with an irrelevant background? Have fun grinding up a new merc to replace them once your company is too good for such rabble! This would be somewhat acceptable if I appreciated the core game loop more, but each battle just feels the same - archers shoot at things, front lines flail at one another, one side breaks. I never felt like I had any agency in the battles, as hit chance is so low you're basically mandated into attacking whatever you have the best chance of hitting.

Weirdly enough, I feel like Battle Brothers has received its praise based on the fact that it nails the fantasy of running a medieval mercenary band. Unfortunately, it really just taught me that running such a company is a grindy slog where you're surrounded by unwashed peasants and everything is bloody and terrible.

23,68280750,english,"This game is a masterwork. But definitely for a particular kind of player. It is incredibly deep and strategic, and though it seems unfair and very random on the surface a lot of the harshness (a lot - not all) can be controlled with proper play and decision-making. But it's unforgiving. One mistake can cause your entire run you fall apart and get everyone killed. Which is perhaps the most realistic part about the game.

There are some games that allow you the option to live completely on the edge - games with a hardcore mode for those who want it. This is a game designed around that mode. You can play it on an easier, safer setting if you like, but you're cheating yourself if you do. Honestly, there are lots of games designed for players who want a guaranteed win as a reward just for trying enough times. This is a game designed to be a guaranteed loss, sooner or later. It's just a matter of how long you can stave it off, and how much you learn in the process.

Any player who likes turn-based strategy and wants to earn every victory should try this. You may not get past the early game. Hell, even I may not get past it - still working on that.

45,68145628,english,"Battle Brothers is a game full of good ideas and flawed execution. At it's heart, it's a highly random tactical RPG in a brutal permadeath roguelike style. All of those things can be fun, if done right. In my opinion, Battle Brothers fails to do them right. Here's why:

[h1]Randomly Generated World[/h1]

Right off the bat, it becomes very clear that this game is all randomized! Random cities! Random quests! Random teammates! Random gear! Random battles! How exciting! And at first, it really is very exciting. But then you see how shallow it is. 
[list]
[*] Random cities! Except all the cities are basically the same, they have different buildings, but most of your time is gonna be spent in the Marketplace and Unit recruiter that every town has anyway. There's noble houses, but they're not accessible in the first ~10 hours of the game, and because you suck at the beginning, it's gonna be a lot more than 10 hours before you get a game to that point.
[*] Random quests! Except there's only like half a dozen quest types available at the start of the game. You're gonna do a lot of em. Deliver a thing, escort a caravan, hunt bandits, hunt monsters, clear out a camp, defend a settlement. Thats it. They get repetitive fast. Especially because they all basically boil down to ""Go to a place and maybe fight something"". And because so few are offered at each place, you rarely get a choice of whether to accept or not. You'll often need the cash too badly to refuse a quest.
[*] Random teammates! Except they're only distinguishable by a handful of often barely relevant traits. Much more important are their stats, which, while simple enough to understand, are plentiful enough that you'll struggle to remember who has what, especially as your crew surpasses 12 people. None of them really have personalities or anything, so there's no story events to do with the teammates, and they're too many and too quickly lost for you to even really learn their names. Also they're all men, there doesn't seem to be any reason some of them couldn't be battle sisters. (And before you say something about realism, there are orcs and zombies in this game). 
[*] Random gear! Credit where it's due. The gear system in this game is very cool. Every weapon has its own set of moves, and armor acts like extra hit points, but makes your guys wear out faster if it's too heavy. It's really pretty neat. My big problem here is with accessibility of information. There's no way to know when you're getting an item what it's good for until you've fought with it a bunch
[*] Random battles! Except that they're pretty much all battles on an open field with maybe some hills or rough terrain. Combat is a huge part of this game and we'll definitely talk about it more, but this is just to say that there's only so many classes of enemies, and only like 3 or 4 types of terrain, and ultimately the battles end up feeling samey pretty fast. Battles in fortified locations and ambushes especially feel glaringly missing from the game. It's weird to descend into a tomb, only to then fight the undead within on a grassy plain. 
[/list]

All this to say, there's a lot of random generation, but it doesn't amount to much, and it feels like everyone who plays is going to get basically the same fairly repetitive experience. 

[h1]Combat[/h1]

As discussed above, there's not much depth on the worldmap. Which means the vast overwhelming majority of your time will be spent in combat. The game is going for a tactical combat system, which means that in an ideal world, combat would be filled with complex and nuanced decisions with lots of tradeoffs. Sadly, combat comes down a lot more to comparing stats and rolling dice. Let's break it down. 

Combat happens on randomized terrain. There's a few terrain types, grassland, forest, swamp, snow, the usual. And which you fight in has a lot to do with where you are on the map. The big problem is that you get very little choice in the matter. Most fights happen in the terrain they're destined to happen in, it takes a lot of time to move to different terrain and time is money. And there's no way to make it so you have the advantage on the map. No way to attack from hills, no way to ambush sleeping enemies, no way to sneak up behind their lines, no way to surprise them in a forest. Total War does terrain right, this game merely pays lip-service to it. 

Combat is tense. And that's a good thing. It's exciting to see if your attacks will hit. It's satisfying to see your enemies fall. It's nerve wracking to see your guy's face get bloodied as his armor breaks. This tension, however, comes from the unforgiving randomness of the whole thing. The game uses a % to hit system, similar to games like XCOM or Fire Emblem, and unlike those games (I believe) the % you see is your actual chance to hit. A percent chance to hit is fine, the problem comes in how hard it is to modify that chance during a fight. There's a bonus for flanking, but you can't very well move your whole army to get one guy. If they have a shield, and you have spare energy and an axe, you can break it. If you're lucky enough to have the high ground, that helps. And you can use stuff like a one time net. But that's kind of it, which makes it so that on most turns you think something like ""Ah, I have a 29% chance to hit, that kinda sucks. Oh well, I guess I'll do it anyway because I still need to hit him and there's nothing I can really do about it"".

Each character has a small handful of moves they can do. Hit someone, hit them the special way your weapon does, block if you have a shield, and walk places. You can do a fair bit on each turn for the first few turns of a fight before your guys get tired. You can carry more stuff if you want to have more options, but switching the stuff out takes a fair bit of time, and just carrying the extra stuff hurts your fatigue, which means you have even fewer turns before getting tired. This system of punishing the player for trying to have options in a game that's supposed to be tactical strikes me as severely flawed. And again, I don't give a fuck about realism, when I'm fighting zombies. 

There are of course, basic brigands to fight. But there are also more interesting enemies with a variety of strong, challenging abilities. This sounds like a good thing, the problem is that it's not. See, nothing tells you what these abilities are, this is the same problem XCOM has, it means that the first time you see a new enemy that has some cool new ability, your options are basically get lucky or die. And even once you've seen an ability in play, unless you go look it up online, you have no way of knowing the details of what it does, because nothing in the game tells you. This means that to learn the strategies for each type of enemy, you have to fight them over and over again, and get lucky or slaughtered every time. It gets old fast. 

What all this leads to is most (I say most because there are exception) fights coming down to a comparison of stats and probabilities. The most important thing for any heavily probability based tactics game to do is give the player ways to shift the odds in their favor, and there's just not enough of that in this game, and what there is isn't accessible or explained enough to be used in your first several runs. So yeah, maybe once you have 300 hours in it, there are real tactical decisions to be made, because you are informed enough to make those decisions. 

[h1] Conclusion [/h1]

The bottom line is, if you love roguelike games, and love the setting, and don't mind a grind, and love the tension of a high stakes die roll, you might like this game.

PROS
+ Brutal. One of the hardest tactical games I've ever played.
+ Replayability is extremely high. It's fun to start over every time.
+ Not bogged down with long dialogue. You make your own story.
+ Great art style. Clean, crisp, quaint.
+ Good unit customization. Classes, traits, perks, skills, gear.
+ Low-fantasy and grounded. For the most part.
+ Passionate indie devs who know what they want for the game.

CONS
- Needs more animations and visual variety.
- Needs more variety in overland map mechanics.
- Some encounters seem unbalanced/impossible.

As you go around doing contracts and making money, eventually some end game event will begin to trigger and, usually with you help, said end game event will end.

At its opening billing, it was a tight turn based mercenary company rpg with a heaping dose of rogue-like influence and absolutely unforgiving combat.  It was a grimdark look at what it would be like to be a soldier for hire in a medieval fantasy land, and it was fascinating.  Upon release, it was let down by its sheer difficulty and a simple lack of content.  It was summarily labelled ""complete"" by its developers, and I stopped playing for lack of new challenge. 

Three years later in 2020, two full fledged expansions have been released along with a third promised sometime likely next year.  They are excellent and show great promise for the future of a game with very high potential.  Variety is up, running out of challenges is now almost impossible.  I am back and enjoying it immensely again.  I can see this being something I come back to like a bad habit.  

Is it for everyone?  Not even close.  Is it niche?  Absolutely.  Will it make you cry?  Likely.  But give it a chance and you might have the opportunity to experience a game that distills the essence of what made Mount and Blade and XCOM so very good.

Overall it is a devious, well written, well constructed strategy game that will keep you coming back, or scare you away immediately.

This is a good game.
As far as I can tell, there is no massive storyline you have to pay a lot of attention to. It's a case of hire some sellswords (the more sordid their background, the more appealing!), gear them up with what you can afford or whatever you grab from the corpses you're bound to make, and seek out to make a name for yourselves.
It's turn-based, so you can easily go make yourself a cup of tea half way through a battle should you get thirsty.
I've already ""lost"" a few hours by playing this game; telling myself I'll ""only play this until 5pm - then go make yourself some dinner"".... I next look at the clock to find it's 7:30pm and my stomach is still rumbling!
It's got a good soundtrack to it as well. It's just varied enough to be catchy and have a sense of epic-battle..ness about it without being annoying.
This is definitely worth buying at full price.
Well done devs.


UPDATE:
02/08/17
As much as I love this game however, the only one moan I have to make is the frequency of undead enemies in comparison to others; i.e even when fighting brigands - usually after you kill a few there is a 9/10 chance that one or more will come back as one of the undead during the same fight (hell, even the undead come back as the undead during some fights!) More and more contracts pit you against the undead, there are more undead in the wild etc. I would thoroughly enjoy for there to be an option to turn off undead enemies or at least turn off regular enemies respawning as undead during a fight.
How many times have I said undead during this update???

14,67240295,english,"[h1]There's nothing new in this game - but you'll love it anyway[/h1]

Hex-based RPGs have been around forever.

They are usually quite similar in substance and if you were trying to create a game which blended the most common aspects of them you would end up with Battle Brothers.

The high-fantasy medieval squad management sim is a well trodden path: fight, loot, rinse, repeat.

Here you play a mercenary company commander in a world filled with orcs, undead and bickering human city states. Pretty run of the mill clichéd stuff. It's something the developers freely admit.

So how does an uninspired concept work in 2D so well? Simply put, Battle Brothers goes back to basics and does them brilliantly. 

[h2] You'll need more than sword and board [/h2]

Let's start with the combat. It's tough.

You can't expect to run around the world and steamroll every engagement. Do that and you can expect to have your band of brothers hacked to pieces and sent packing.

Just to make it that little bit harder, deaths are permadeaths.

You've got to look at what you're facing, the terrain in front of you and try to determine if you have got what it takes to win that encounter.

That might mean clinging to the high ground, advancing rapidly to avoid a hail of arrows or bracing for an onslaught because there's no time to prepare.

Every weapon has strengths and weaknesses so equipping the right blend is key to overcoming what is in front of you. Weapon classes mean something and fights are tense affairs, creating a real sense of reward.

The lack of auto-resolve is something the devs feel strong about but it is tiresome to fight an easy enemy in dense terrain or battles where you fight alongside the AI as an ally.  

[h2] No frills [/h2]

Thankfully, that's the only real part of the game which feels like a chore. The focus is on rewards and fighting so that's what you spend most of your time doing.

The procedurally generated world has settlements dotted across it and because of the way each one usually specialises in a particular good you need to visit a good deal of them.

Once there, you can see what is on offer regarding quests, shops and potential new recruits quickly.

It's a stripped-back experience and deliberately so; meaning you can get what you want quickly and get back to picking your next fight.

Quests are fairly repetitive in nature but because you're not bogged down with boring details and there's no attempt to make narrative for narrative's sake you don't mind. Some chumps are about to smash this village up and we need help? Fine, let's crack some skulls.

And if you fancy going off-piste into the mountains or whatnot, there's plenty lurking in wait for you.

[h2] Freedom [/h2]

The idea is as you progress with quests and battles you become eligible for better quests and your troops upgrade, putting you in better shape for the end-game event/s (which varies so you'll need different tactics to overcome it/them).

You have full control over what your Brothers fight in and there's a comprehensive but not overwhelming talent tree. You can't have everything and there's a real need to have a variety of builds within your team.

However, it's up to you how you build your recruits and what you want them to become. Hybrid characters are just a necessity as your tanks are because the situation changes from battle to battle and even round to round.

On top of this you will need to heal battle survivors and manage their morale. The company might have got through the scrape alive, but Lothar will never recover fully from that spear in the leg. Or the fact his nose was sliced off by a dagger and only two holes remain.

[h2] Sterile world [/h2]

This is a fine example of a procedurally generated game; challenging encounters with enough complexity and depth in the core game to make up for deficiencies elsewhere.

RNG games will always be a source of frustration and the world doesn't feel like it changes much at all. Yes, some settlements will be destroyed and change hands but there's not quite enough going on to make you feel like you are making a difference.

Character interaction is paper thin but given the high turnover of mercenaries perhaps that would be detrimental about the same. Some side quests for a particular character would be a nice touch and perhaps some real animosity between mercenaries from different backgrounds wouldn't go amiss.

Likewise, could a trusted lieutenant and a few lackeys be trusted to do some quests? How about the ability to invest in some of the settlements?

[h2] Worth a buy [/h2]

That being said, the core game is a brilliant one and provides countless hours of entertainment. Battle Brothers is up there with one of the best RPGs today because it knows what it is.

Gameplay will always trump graphics and if you're still churning out highly-awaited DLCs after three years, you've done something right.

The soundtrack is very good and memorable (I enjoy the noble fight soundtracks). The artwork isn't cutting edge but is detailed and pleasing to look at. It will grow on you over time. The weaponry and armor are well balanced and give reason to use inferior equipment to serve a greater purpose. It takes longer for weaker weapons to obsolete.

You can hover over someone to see their exact status, but it's rarely required. Once you settle in you start to realize the game is giving you a tremendous amount of visual information in a very subtle and beautiful way.

Different opponents feel different. It's not just different stats and skins. They act differently and you will have to react accordingly to survive. You will have to manage your squad stat distributions and talent-trees effectively, and equip them with versatile gear to handle the diversity of threats. Different terrains handle differently, again squad and equipment versatility is key. 

The first time you fight a necromancer you're probably going to lose because it's different from other encounters and you don't know what to do. But you're going to feel like you fought a necromancer. No one zombie is a threat, but beating them all down will fatigue your guys out. The spearman holding up your left flank is going to break his spear from spending so long in shieldwall. He's going to try to fall back but he's not going to make it. Your hammer guy will take a couple out but he goes too. Then he gets resurrected. Then he gives your bow guy brain damage. You'll realize you needed to start pressuring the necromancer right away. But it's too late. He's too far away and the swamp is too hard to move through. One by one you all get dragged into the mud.

Orc Berserkers will absolutely freak you out. Nothing else gets on your flanks that fast. They don't wear much armor so if you have the bows and a bit of luck you can take them down. If you don't have the bows or the luck then your back rank is dead which means your front rank is surrounded. Which means your front rank is dead.

The Loot/Inventory system is Diabloesque. There is no weight and, unlike Diablo but common in many followers, each item occupies the same amount of space in inventory. Certain items stack in slots, most do not. It's essentially the simplest possible way to do things, which means you spend as little time as possible managing inventory. Which is great because this is a game, not an inventory management simulation.

You are not being flooded with loot. The $3,000 greatsword that would be your throw away starter weapon in other games is something you're going to have to work for here. You're going to have to get good to afford it. And yes I said greatsword. Not Greatsword +2. Not Flaming Greatsword of UnHoly Death. Just: greatsword. It's refreshing. There is more exciting loot than that, too be clear, but you're going to have to earn it.

I heard about it just by reading reviews of some many other games, where it kept being referenced. I did not think it could match the hype. It absolutely has. It's streamlined, it's polished, and it's fun as hell.",1586409758,1586409758,True,58,7,0.839509367942810059,0,True,False,False,76561197989760209,136,4,7411,0,3147,1591707604,,

39,66882300,english,"I really wanted to love this game, it sounds right up my street, a kind of turn based Mount and Blade. Unfortunately, I have a hard time recommending it to anyone because it's deeply flawed. As a result, I had to say I would not recommend.

The meat of the game is in the combat, and apart from 2 little niggles, it's a treat. The niggles are that the interface is clunky. It's easy to miss an enemy you've surrounded, especially if there's terrain as there's nothing really to distinguish them easily from your brothers. Also, if you're playing a map with multiple levels, cycling up and down to target the guy behind a hill is a chore. The other is that the enemies don't seem to follow the same rules you do, they'll be in heavy armour and running about using all their abilities and never tiring, or shooting full distance with marksmen at night and nailing your back rank nearly every shot. Bad as these sound, they're actually pretty forgivable and more mild annoyances than anything, the weapon diversity is amazing in this game and you'll want a good mix of loadouts in your warband. The combat is brutal and feels impactful, with consequences and is definitely the best part of this game.

Now on to the bad. The strategic level, where you move your warband around looking for work is awful. You can speed up a little, but it's still painfully slow if you're travelling any distance. There are far far too few contracts, even in larger towns and you'll find yourself simply wandering around trying to take almost every contract because you need gold to pay your men and buy supplies/hire replacements/upgrade equipment. 

The contract negotiations are an absolute joke 90% of the time. You blindly ask for more and they say yes or no, that's it. Occasionally you'll get the option to get more money per head, or more in advance, but half the time they'll refuse, so you can't rely on that either.

The economy has a nice foundation, but is completely unrealised. It's rare you can buy any goods to trade and when you find a place to sell them at a profit, the amount you make is paltry, less than the easiest contract. Not to mention, finding these trade routes is difficult enough and places to sell high are on an unknown timer. 

You have little to no way of influencing any changes on the world map. It would be nice if you could influence/fund the building of certain buildings in towns, get factions more powerful, fund the building of new roads, etc. But you have very little way of influencing this, outside of accepting contracts you more or less have to accept anyway or you'll run out of gold.

Upgrading your company feels pretty superficial outside of upgrading your brothers. You occasionally get the option to save up for a cart for more inventory space or a banner, but that's really it. It would have been nice to see the option for more stuff, like, for instance, horses to increase overland movement, merchants to decrease buying prices, apothecaries to make wound treating faster and more effective, blacksmith to increase your repair speed and maybe forge new equipment, buy a keep for your company to reside at to have people come to you to hire you, a diplomat to get you better pay for contracts, etc. Some of this stuff might exist, but if it does, RNG hasn't shown it to me yet.

Overall, this game has great combat, but outside of that feels really half realised. Like no time was invested in anything but the combat. As a result, it feels really mediocre and a big let down as the foundation of a really fantastic game is there, just needs a mod or dlc or two and it'd be a 10/10. As it stands, I'd probably rate it a 6.5/10.

67,25778086,english,"Battle Brothers is just about as close to my ideal game as is possible.

At its heart, it's a turn-based squad-level combat simulator set in a low-fantasy, procedurally-generated world.  Yet to dismiss it solely as such would be to do the game a grave disservice.

The strategic layer of the game melds seamlessly into the tactical, yet can be easily glossed over and to my mind is where most games are lost.  This really is a game that hammers home the truth of the Sun-Tzu attributed quote ""Victorious warriors win first and then go to war, while defeated warriors go to war first and then seek to win"".  In short, tactical nous will only take you so far.  The reality of this game is that even a genius can't lead untrained and ill-equipped peasants in to battle against savage Orc warriors and expect anything than utter annihilation.

The game is therefore as much about managing your fledgling mercenary concern as it is slaughtering your enemies.  And it is through this management that the greatest aspect of the game (imo) becomes apparent: your Battle Brothers themselves.  Like the world they inhabit, characters are procedurally-generated, have their own mini-bio and a range of traits and stats that fluctuate within parameters based on their background.   As they adventure under your guidance, win (and lose) battles, level up and - in some cases - gain career-defining permanent injuries you will find it hard to not become attached to them.  it is this attachment coupled with the ever-present fear or a sudden, horrible death befalling your favourites that brings out the best in the game.

Some people may find the game 'grindy' or lacking end-game content and a story.  While I can accept that these are legitimate concerns, it's the sandbox appeal and lack of rigid story that I enjoy - the characters I hire become the story and keep me entertained.

The DLCs have added some excellent content including rudimentary crafting and perhaps best of all multiple different starting company compositions.

The premise, a low-fantasy mercenary manager, is very interesting.  The art style, the music, the sound effects, the random map generator are all excellent.

The DLC adds a lot of extra content given the price-point, so I recommend getting it all together.  But even so, I didn't get to experience a lot of the added content because I was too worried about combat losses/insufficient pay/starvation/undefeatable mobs to buy/find/activate it.

All in all, a decent game, but one I won't be coming back too very often.

I had to get to around 10-15 hours in before I really started to be able to appreciate challenging scenarios.

So in summary, somewhere along the line the game decided it wanted to be more like DS or DD, and I'm glad the devs seemed to have pulled back from turning the game into a grindfest altogether. However, this seems to have had the unintended consequence of putting all the grinding and cheesing into the early game, and despite my review below I did in fact find myself having to scroll forums to find ways to get through. And yes, I cheesed the game a little to survive. I can recommend it, but it's still a bit of an unwarranted kick in the nuts for a beginner/intermediate in early game.


+++++++++++ORIGINAL REVIEW++++++++++++++++++++

I can't recommend this game. 

Which is odd because I played in ER when it first came out and I loved it; it was easy to pick up but difficult to master.

Now I come back to it I find it's been taken over by the same  braindead ethos of darkest dungeon and dark souls, that gameplay has to be frustratingly difficult from the off to ""count"" and be worthwhile. DD is in my opinion, not as good a game as it thinks it is because it hides behind the difficulty level to make up for repetitive, grindy content. BB *had* a fresh perspective and lots of new ideas, it didn't need to do the same thing at all?

Because it had been a while I started a normal campaign at first and then proceeded to watch my ass get handed to me over and over for three hours. The game has gone from offering a learning curve that allowed you to lose here and there and still get by to one poor decision and its game over. I get that this is what some players want. But that's what levels of difficulty are there for, and that wasn't the experience I asked for when I selected normal difficulty, so something in the game has shifted from what it used to be.

There is nothing about the beginner/normal levels of difficulty that cater to players who don't want to sink hundreds of hours into the game or read forums constantly to learn how to min/max stats or cheese their way out of difficult situations. What happened to having a fun game that tried to offer an experience to everyone?

I am going to keep trying, but I've lost a bit of respect for the game and can't really say it's as fun as I remember it being.",1585441234,1585751845,True,2,0,0.483720928430557251,1,True,False,False,76561198037202247,156,2,6567,0,2505,1586717718,,

85,66260007,english,"Having sank just shy of 300 hours into Battle Brothers at the time of writing this review, I can safely say this is one of my favourite games to have been released in recent years, and perhaps of all time.

In Battle Brothers you assume the role of a mercenary captain attempting to (in the default scenario) rebuild your recently decimated company from a mere three, poorly equipped sellswords, into a unit of professional mercenaries able to cut down any foe that is thrown at them. 

Recruiting new mercenaries is a vital part of bolstering your ranks and replacing losses down the line.
Recruits come in all manner of shapes and sizes ranging from naive farmers desperate to make some coin to hardened war veterans who know how to swing a sword (and expect better payment for doing so). This makes Battle Brothers a game as much about managing your finances and supplies whilst travelling throughout the world as much as it forces you to be tactical and cunning in battle to avoid losses and maximise rewards. 

That of course brings me onto the combat itself. Combat in Battle Brothers is brutal and unforgiving of mistakes, especially on higher difficulties, making it somewhat intimidating for beginners as you can often find yourself outnumbered and under-equipped if you rush head first into combat without adequate preparation. That being said, I find the combat mechanics to be fair as the stats of your sellswords play a huge part in how well they fare in combat. Careful investment in skill points, equipment and perks are key to building a solid unit of professionals who can create havoc for any opponent the game throws at them.

Perhaps my favourite aspect of Battle Brothers is the very nature of the mercenary work itself. It makes a refreshing change not to be playing as the righteous hero for once and instead as morally redundant sellswords whose only concern is making coin and spending nights in the tavern. That's not to say you won't often find yourself helping the many desperate people of the harsh world in which you all inhabit, but it is never out of the goodness of your heart but rather the depth of their pockets. This creates ample opportunities for backstabbing and various other nefarious activities.

Though my review is somewhat brief and only really scratches the surface of what Battle Brothers has to offer, I cannot stress enough how much I adore this game and I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone with an interest in turn-based combat and party management.

(One last note, the devs for this game are amazing and are continuing to release new and interesting content on a fairly frequent basis as of late and deserve all the support they get. Much love.)

You will lead a band of mercenaries across this world fulfilling contracts, exploring ruins, and fighting the denizens therein.

The tactical combat in Battle Brothers is a good representation of melee-centric tactical combat; the different armaments, equipment, and the skills of your soldiers make for a very deep and compelling tactical combat experience.

The characters that you command are randomly generated, coming from different backgrounds.

The depth of the game is something you truly have to dig into to understand and that will wall out a lot of easily frustrated people. But once you get into it all the RNG and risk management becomes something you have control over, you can never eliminate all risk but you will learn ways and strategies that can make most fights worth taking.

Ultimately, this design philosophy of the battles in this game just doesn't align with my play style. It's clear that battles in this game are designed to be EXTREMELY deadly; at any point, one or two swings from an enemy will kill your soldiers outright. That could be interesting and kind of fun in a different setup - unfortunately, at the same time, Battle Brothers tries to get you invested into characters; gives them little backgrounds, stories, skills, equipment, even cool names. 

These two things really clash at the end of the day for me. Either make combat ridiculously deadly and give me a small army of troops I don't care about, or ask me to invest time and energy into character building and create predictable and logical damage ranges and battles where i can more reliably predict the outcome. The two at the same time just create a scenario where i have to save the game every few minutes, because I don't want my guys to be one-shotted every other battle. 

The core flow of the game, although feeling shallow and not fleshed out, is actually pretty solid. I like the idea of a band of mercenaries running around a map with a mini-economy and a bunch of factions. But that map doesn't ever really change, the games factions feel very static, and it doesn't offer the tools to investigate a more merchant play style. 

I'm frankly torn on recommending this or not. Some changes or tweaks to the combat and adding some robustness and depth to the strategic elements of the game would probably change my ""do not recommend"" view.

If you're the type that doesn't get too invested in your squad and just sorta clicks around, I think you could enjoy this.

Improvements I'd like to see in form of DLC or in Battle Brothers 2:

Make us care about the brothers more, figure out ways to give each a personality. Can talk to them in camp, more events related to just the brothers as you travel, sometimes dialogue when a brother dies (back and forth conversation in bubble) with animation of another brother going to knee and cradling him, or after the event start chat reminiscing about a lost brother, maybe some voice over, etc. 

Make it more realistic, add morale mechanic at the tavern (or add brothel) were your men can have sex. Don't need to visualise it, it just doesn't make sense from a lore perspective that a bunch of mercenaries only want to drink, fight but NOT F!!K...

Depending on what kills your brother have interesting and meaningful things happen at times (especially if wipes out whole party): if human then animations of them pissing on your dead guys or throwing bodies into a mass grave, if zombie with necromancer you have chance to be raised a zombie and a new game mechanic starts were you have to try and survive to become a necromancer, if do then you can start raising an undead army, goblins take some alive and put in cage (chance to escape) but much higher chance for animation of going to the cook pots.

Mini games: 

- Add playing dice when camping with your men, keep track of all the money a brother has made from salary paid to them, this allows you to try and win back some of that money. Chance of brother leaving or starting a fight with another brother. 
- Add jousting/archery etc tournament event mini games. Chance of embarrassing a sore loser noble who then attacks your party.
- Add card game at tavern - have interesting outcomes, like if you win big, chance that news spreads and a bandit group attacks not long after leave town.
- Some events were two or more brothers are at conflict, you have dialogue options that have chance to resolve it peacefully, but if not, then a fight starts, other interesting ideas can branch from this e.g. you have to choose who to support and thus fight to death.
- Add hunting, you either get food or robert baratheoned...


More late game options: 
Village/Kingdom: Start your own village that overtime grows. Lots of interesting game mechanics can then be added, such as: garrison town to repel raids, grow village into huge town/citadel, war with other factions, conquest/capture of other towns, hiring mercenaries, sending out trade caravans, new resources to gather to upgrade/build new buildings (weaponsmith etc), smithy/amoursmith mechanic added that can be levelled so you can have a famed smith eventually build best loot in the game, etc.
The age of dragons or some equally awesome event (gateway to hell opened) that introduces new lore/monsters.

------ The rpg elements are very poorly implemented imo, we have one or at best 2 dialogue options to pick from, and they are usually very specific and limiting, meaning we can't actually role play our own character :/ 

-------- For some reason ""our"" character has a lot of auto dialogue, this combined with the bad dialogue system means we have pretty much no control over the pc :/

-- I wish we could make our own hirelings/mercs, and our own main character, like how we can in Pillars of eternity.


Overall i really like this game, and as a turn based tactical game it's one of the best ones out there as far as i know, i only wish they had made the rpg part as good as the rest of the game, although the rpg part is still vastly superior to something like tw3 or mass effect, or anything else that has a voiced pc with tons of autodialogue and cutscenes :/",1571231810,1584590708,True,6,0,0.592233002185821533,0,True,False,False,76561198048791724,93,57,654,0,71,1597368530,,

Still that aside its a game if you can get into you will sink alot of time into it. There is no real storyline, if you do the tutorial it has a short story. However with no story on rails you can have a lot of play throughs because each play through is different. You can play how you want to play and the game has a different map each play through.

The game has a lot of different equipment and the equipment is great it all feels different. I also enjoy small crafting elements where you can craft rare items with items you collect from hunting beasts and monsters. The fact you have to actually read to contracts(quests)and pay attention is great as well.  If you don't pay attention and understand the contract you can pick one you might not win... and make no money.  This game is about making money and creating best merc company.  It has a business management element which I enjoy, you can go broke fast i f you don't manage your money correctly. The game has to much to list here unless I want to write 10 paragraphs.

Quite Immersive aswell and the Character building within your company is pretty good. I actually have quite abit to praise in this game but sadly this review will be a negative one, I have never once walked away from this game feeling anything but Anger and Annoyance at How this game relies ENTIRELY on RNG. ""Tactical"" Is a very loose term because Flanking seemingly does nothing except slightly affect enemy Morale, Placing your Archers On higher ground to get some good shots in, oh wait you Can't hit anyone because higher ground is made meaningless by Some weird as fuck Cover mechanic that Auto reduces your chance to hit to roughly between 5%-15% If the enemy is  ; Next to a Tree, Next to one of their allies, Using a Shield, Next to one of your allies. So basically ranged attacks are useless almost all of the time. And Higher ground does NOT allow you to shoot over your allies except in very specific Circumstances. So you roll all Close Quarters Infantry. Using a 2 handed Weapon and Heavy armor isn't recommended either. If a Character doesn't have a Shield they are almost ALWAYS hit and the Damage models are so all over the place its very hard to risk because a brigand wielding a club could one shot your level 3 full chainmail wearing, huge axe wielding Collossus. XCOM does RNG correctly, this is just fucking frustrating ALL of the time. Bad dice rolls and a seemingly straight up cheating AI systems have caused me to restart every campaign I have ever started. I Don't want to write this review, I really don't. Even on the absolute easiest settings this game feels nothing but Cheap. I fought a Battle 6 on 6, unarmoured brigands using almost all Wooden weapons and daggers with no Shields vs my fully kitted out Team of 2 armoured crossbowmen with back up weapons, Chainmail wearing 2 handed axe man, Lammelar Wearing Spearmen and 2 Flail users wearing leather. All level 2 or 3. Enemy Archer quick shots across the map killing my first crossbow man immediately, Enemy team moves up. I miss every attack on 2 rounds of combat, all 60% chance to hit. Enemy team never miss once, break all armour on first turn, except for collosus man, who is one shot by a club wielding Peasant. I am now outnumbered, 4 v 6, My spearmen gang up and manage to ALMOST kill one man, by that point the rest of my men have been swarmed and killed without ever hitting the enemy once,  One spearman flees battle the other dies like a Bitch. Fuck Artificial Difficulty, Fuck RNG and FUCK this Game. It had so much potential that is absolutely RUINED by Cheating AI and Obvious RNG bullshit. It's gameplay is nothing but frustrating and Rage inducing.

Battle Brothers is a genuinely challenging game and can often be very unforgiving. There will be times when you may feel optimistic. You're band of mercenaries have gotten stronger and have decent gear, you've made the right choices, fought skillfully against all the odds, You got this, right? 

Hell No, without any warning, you are slapped with a major setback when you are unexpectedly  attacked by 12 Orcs with Heavy Armor, You fight hard with your 7 loyal Mercs, it's a hard slog, but eventually must accept defeat and Make a desperate retreat from the battlefield. You only have 4 men left, 2 of them severely wounded and bleeding out fast. 

You must find a Temple asap before they bleed to death or suffer from permanent damage, Such as severe brain damage or a crippled leg.  It's not like You can just drink a magicPotion or heal them with what you have.  ok, the temple is far away, will take almost 2 days to get there. 

When you finally make it and are able to get them the medical attention they need,  You discover that you don't have enough Money to cover the costs of all their wounds.  It's a difficult choice but ""WolfGang' despite having shown you unwavering loyalty, who has been stood beside you in the blood soaked battle fields must go untreated. 

You place him in reserve while you're other 3 men are forced to sell whatever gear you can part with, Find work in order to earn money for his surgery.  3 days later, His wounds heal but is partially crippled for life. ""Wolfgang"" is no longer the Fighting man he once was. Now You're forced let him go,  You disband him from the party and hire an inexperienced farmer to take his place.  

The greatest thing about this game is it's unpredictability, Every map is procedurally generated, Events happen seemingly at random, Basically you never know what you're going to get.  You have to deal with the cards life gives you even if they aren't very good.  This makes for endless replayability and will constantly challenge you at ever turn.

25,47890789,english,"Fantastic, unique and challenging game. This is one of those games that draws you in just because the challenge will eat you alive and after a few hours of grinding through the hard life of a mercenary you'll need a shower to wash away the imaginary blood, mud and sweat. There are tough choices to make and the game can be ruthless with the RNG attribute. That is what makes the personality of this game. It makes you love it and hate it at the same time. 

The sounds of the game are rich. The clash of metal, serrated steel blades clashing against chain mail or the thudding of the morning star against the skull it just turned to mush. The roar of the creatures as they pound the earth violently closing the gap on your band, the gurgling of blood as foe or friend slumps to his death, the lopping off of a head as a battleaxe slices through the neck it once sat upon. You feel a sense of victory after each battle that had to be thought through well enough to keep all of your men alive and the loss of a man can sting hard after he became a brother in arms and one of the links in your chain mail, in a manner of speaking. Or maybe you hired a particular man to die. Blood spent to expand a company of stronger men. He signed on the dotted line...

Don't let the graphics fool you. This game is rich and diverse and the graphics actually are pretty spectacular just in their own right as being unique. It provides a sense of playing a classic table top while also containing realistic virtues. You can customize your men slightly at the barber shop, though I wish there was a little bit more substance there, but still a neat feature. You can rename your men. One of my favorite features of this game, however, is how the equipment changes you make on your men are reflected in their appearance. 

There really is no game out there like this. The concept is unique and if you are into RPG, fantasy, medieval and turn based with an open world to roam around in, you'll want to add this game to your library. And it's a manly man's game. It isn't ruined by a bunch of fairy tale feminist bs as a lot of games these days are.

No matter what you do, early, middle and late games are the same. It seems like the devs tried to give a degree of customization to your mercs with different starts, but it just falls flat on its face as no matter what you fight the same things in the same order according to power progression. Instead of contracts everywhere that let you pick a specialization for your mercenaries, you get a few contracts that force you into bad plays or go broke. Nothing like picking a monster slaying merc start...only to be unable to slay most monsters in the game and have to restort to killing bandits for two months until you can actually afford the stuff you need to win against monsters. It doesn't matter what stats you selected, unless you have the right equipment for a certain monster set, you're screwed.

If you don't select melee skill and defense with fatigue for your fighters? Dead. Didn't feel like picking hammer specialization to defeat armor? Dead. Wanted to make even a basic archer? Lol too bad, almost everything except bandits is immune to archery for most purposes, even crossbows which supposedly defeat armor. Banshees are the best example of this.

>Devs: Hmm, lets see. I made these banshees that are blocked by huge piles of other damage sponges (weidergangers) and can instantly route the players forces from a distance with no consistent way to prevent it (You guessed it, you need a special accessory to be immune to banshee screams). Maybe I should make them vulerable to shooting to compensate for this huge advantage?
>Other devs: Nah F that bro, lets make them totally immune to archery instead! That's a great idea!

The big problem is that this game is not fun. They really, really tried, but unless you make the same long term decision making that you are supposed to pick every game, you will fail. There is no room for the player to have fun, every design choice is designed to suck the life from a player's experience.

The good parts of the game is it's a simple strategic game with simple graphics.  There are a variety of weapons for your mercs, a variety of occupations that can affect outcomes and the scenes.  You also have the option how to develop your Merc.

Here is the big problem, I'm playing on beginner and I'm getting creamed.  First, If the enemy is one grid square away without a shield, why are the chances so low for a miss with a missle weapon? If a couple of high level Mercs die, your out some major cash and the difficulty goes up significantly since your renown is high.  The higher the renown, the stronger the enemies.
Oh, and I wanted to add WTF is with the undead skeletons so strong and wearing armor that weighs more than them?!  They are level 1 undead, just a pile of bones held together by a weak magical force.  You should just be able to crush those pile of bones! Yet the devs made them into a horde of undead Hemans.

This is a close second. If you love XCOM game you'll love Battle Brothers. It's easy to get started. Very easy. But don't that means the game will be easy to win - it isn't. While it doesn't have the amazing graphics of XCOM 2, it may have more depth. And perhaps better tactical battles. 

You are in charge of creating your own group of men that go on missions to try to earn money.   You have many ways to build up your squad of fighters. You purchase (based on what you can afford which isn't usually much) the armor, weapons (each weapon has pluses and minuses) and all other equipment. You have to make sure there is enough food to travel with, tools to repair your equipment and bandages to heal your warriors. That costs money. In battle, you choose who stands in the front and who is in the back with bows. You choose who to hire. You choose whether to take advantage of some peasant on the street or help him or her out. Many choices. Some benefit you - some don't.

The game is HARD (I play on hard for economics and combat difficulty). Just when you think you've got it all figured out your squad gets wiped out and the game is over. That may frustrate some players. But that is EXACTLY what I'm looking for in a game. I want to be challenged. I want the game to test me. Battle Brother does. It doesn't apologize for being tough (it warns you every chance it gets when you start playing).

I haven't played 255 hours (game is always left running on my dedicated game machine) but I've played a lot. Haven't gotten too deep. Why? Because my squad keeps dying!

A note on the graphics: expertly done. The little heads have so much emotion with their animations and noises. It's gritty and grusome without needing to put in 3D models. I'd argue that the 2D heads make it even more grusome, because you can see every detail of damage in the painted faces.

79,50727775,english,"Wow. Just wow. I cannot think of a time in my life when I have seen a game that lies so blatantly about the ""odds"". Not even worth reading their ""numbers"", as they are completely fabricated and the game determines whether you win or lose based on tea leaves or the alignment of planets or something, not on strategy or skill. The enemy will make virtually every sub 10% shot, and your crew will have a hard time making two 90% shots in a row. Every. Single. Game. The ""odds"" in this game are like winning the lottery 7 times in a row without buying a ticket.

Really sad too, as this game ticks every box I want in a game, and then they go and ruin it to unplayable by making it a complete rng fest. This is in no way a strategy game. If they fixed that one ""feature"" then I would recommend this game over and over, but if it is just the whim of the programmer as to if you survive a battle or not, then what's the point in playing the game?


Edit: Okay so people seem to think the rng is legit percentage rolls and functioning properly, whatever I don't care anymore. I will simply warn all you new potential players in one simple way. This game is very similar to game of thrones, in depth of character building and in killing off of characters you invest a ton in, seemingly at a whim. If that's the kind of game you want, more power to you.

Another Edit: Steam seems to think I need to ""update"" my review, so here goes. I have to save-scum EVERY battle in this game, regardless how inconsequential it seems ahead of the fight. The AI will routinely hit you 5-6 times in a row with below 30% hit chances, while your next 4-6 attacks will miss while having a 80-90% chance according to the game. This is NOT an uncommon or occasional thing, this is the regular, almost every attack type thing. The game has such potential to be amazing, but it is a rage-quit simulator. I keep going back because I want it to be an awesome game, and it certainly has the chops to do so IF it wanted to, but it does NOT seem to follow its own ruleset.

97,63293071,english,"Battle Brothers has become one of my all time favourite games. Nothing else quite nails that hardcore 'warband management' thing like Battle Brothers does. If you loved games like [i]Mount & Blade[/i] or [i]Mordheim[/i], or you've read Glen Cook's [i]The Black Company[/i], then you will love this. The graphical style is simplistic but very well executed - but I think it's the sound design that really makes you feel that warhammer or greatsword connect. Before you know it you are fully immersed in your warband's world, standing in the shield wall with them, wincing every time an enemy gets a blow through. You grow fond of your individual bro's and it hurts to lose any one of them.

The thing that makes this game arguably better than anything else I've played before is the combat system: A lot of thought has been put in to how medieval-period weapons might have been used in a fighting line, which gives the game an authentic, gritty vibe (despite the low fantasy setting). No other game quite scratches that itch for me. The sheer number of tactical options and possible builds available keeps me coming back for more even after a thousand hours play time.

[b]How the game plays:[/b]
The game has come a long way over the years and now is a good time to get involved. You are currently offered a number of different starting scenarios which, among other things, effects what brothers you start with and your relations with various factions. Whatever you decide to start with, you will be dumped on a randomly generated world map dotted with towns and cities. Much like [i]Mount & Blade[/i] your company will be represented by a single unit you can move around the map. You visit towns and pick up contracts to earn money for wages, food and new recruits. At first you will be hiring farmers and labourers, but eventually your renown will grow and you will be able to hire more experienced recruits and buy better equipment. Individual brothers accrue experience and can level up stats and skills allowing them to fill ever more defined roles in your warband. Most of the recruits you hire wont make it to mid-game but those that survive the fiery crucible of early game combat will sometimes become powerful warriors despite their peasant background. This is part of the magic of Battle Brothers; the unlikely alcoholic fisherman growing to become your great hammer-wielding mainstay holding your flank, or the club-footed poacher becoming the eagle-eyed hunter killing necromancers from your back line. You grow with them, you get attached to them.

Once a battle is started the game switches from the game map to its tactical battle mode where you must fight (or flee). The player and the AI take it in turns to move models according to their initiative and take actions according to their action points - all of which should be quite familiar to fans of the genre. Early game is often about forming a shieldwall to protect your back line of archers and polearms. Combat is dangerous and one lucky blow or crossbow shot can really ruin your day. Brothers can and [i]will[/i] die or suffer permanent debilitating injuries. The skill curve in the game is about knowing the tools of your trade and mastering the art of risk management - thus making the RNG work for you rather than against you. However, the Gods will sometimes kill your favourite bro despite your best efforts, and that is Battle Brothers. If that sounds a bit harsh for your tastes there is always the non-ironman mode and the possibility of save-scumming your way through. But really, this game shines in Ironman where you often have to pick up the pieces of your broken and scattered warband and rebuild or start another campaign. Battle Brothers is about the journey, not the destination.

[b]Things you might not like about the game:[/b]
You can clearly see how much I like the game, but sometimes new players can struggle with the notion of RNG. Indeed, some people hate RNGs in all games (which begs the question why they buy them). Quite often I will see a forum post about someone complaining about artificial difficulty, broken RNG and the fact that they missed a 95% hit chance twice in a row. If you think that sounds like something you would say/think then DON'T buy this game. Battle Brothers is structured around RNG dice rolls with various stat and situational modifiers (as I think it should be). However, sometimes, by its very nature, the RNG will not work in your favour and it might feel unfair. 
Another thing, and the reason my friends refuse to play (other than being philistines) is the lack of fancy graphics. If on the other hand you are fine with both of these points, then buy the game now! It's bloody brilliant.

1. The biggest problem is the world generation. I have probably spent 100 hours in trying to generate a cool world to play in. A boring process. I just do it on my second monitor while watching something but still, its a terrible grind of pressing the same 5 buttons over and over and waiting.

2. A brother just died and I have no clue what background he had, what was his equipment, level, stars... Just his name and who killed him is displayed in a list. No other info that really matters to me. You get attached to your team, but more so developing brothers is vital for your strategy. So to have almost zero info on whom died means the devs dident play their own game and did not understand how important starting stats, choices on levelling and perk composition are. When you have a team of 20 brothers which you rotate, you need to know whom died.

3. To survive on the highest difficulty just dont take higher fight quests until you are ready. Start on lvl 1 fighting skulls and stay there until your team is levelled up enough. Do any skull delivery quest you want.  The problem is that Once you do that strategy there is no challenge from start to 200 + days which makes this hard game now boring. You no longer get challenged, it becomes just a grind.

4. I also dislike that if you want a better info in contract negotiations, allowing you to make better choices no such luck. only those that bought the DLC get it. The devs are saying that yeah we improved the game with your feedback, but it is only for those that fork the cash for our DLC.
Speaking of DLC’s, there is no way to select which ones you want to run and which to turn of. The DLC’c introduced some terrible opponents in beasts, the most criticized are Alps, but you are stuck with them. The consensus is they make the game slow and tedious. As one reviewer put it succinctly: “I like this the Beasts & Exploration DLC so much right now I am trying to figure out how to uninstall it”. 

5. You cant really interact with the world, no way to rebuild villages, buy structures in them... etc. After 150+ days the game is a boring grind as you win all fights if you are careful.

6. The biggest thing that pisses me off is that the devs are too lazy to give button binding, so I cant map them on my mouse and have to do weird hand positions on the keyboard. Since this game is a grind, I cant emphasize what a  pain this is in battle after battle.

The 'basic' version of the game is great.
Owning the DLCs is just adding more to an already good thing
<<All this info below is pre-Blazing Desert DLC; looking forward to that one>>


Who are you?
•	You are a Merc
•	Your men/band of troops are very much indeed mortal
•	You do not start out as the uber-hero 
•	Playing on Veteran & Ironman will teach you that...very quickly
•	There is not (at least not at the time of this writing) any way to bring your dead Merc back alive on your team (other than an enemy Necro resurrecting him to fight *against* you, of course).
•	However, there is a small chance that if your Merc is “killed” during battle, that he does end up living, but do not count on it.
•	Even if he does live, he will now have a Permanent Injury for the rest of his life (if he lives much longer at all).
•	Side Note: There is a Steam achievement to see if you can get a guy to survive with 3 Permanent Injuries, but if you do not want to keep a Merc (for whatever reason, you can Dismiss them)



Your Mercs:
•	Who were they before you recruited them to your band of brothers?
•	They all have a Background/profession (this matters)
•	They all have Attributes (which can be increased with level, but that is impacted by Talents)
•	They all have Talents which impact attributes significantly
•	They all have Levels (and as they level they get to pick where they spend their Attribute Points)
•	They all have Traits
•	They all have Morale
•	They all have a daily $ amount you must pay to keep them employed
•	There are also events than can trigger because of the Backgrounds of Mercs.
•	However, as mentioned, all of these areas above are significantly impacted by background
•	As you level, you get to invest points into Attributes & Perks.
•	All Mercs can get Perks, but you can never get them all (choices matter)
•	Over time, you can gain addition Traits (Good & Bad)
•	You can gain Titles, too.
•	You will also get *Ambitions* to achieve certain key milestones within your career.
•	Did your nose get permanently cut off? Was your arm shattered beyond repair? You now have a new trait that will forever impact that Merc.



Weapons:
•	Several Weapon types/classes (ie blunt, slash, etc..)
•	There is a plethora number of weapons within each weapon class/type
•	There are “tiers” of weapons within those
•	Many (most) have certain “abilities/skills” that you get extra by using Weapon X instead of Weapon Y.
•	They all have their pros/cons
•	It matters based upon your tactics, what type of enemy you are fighting, what type of weapons do they have, what type of armor does the enemy have, the types of Mercs you have, the terrain you are in, items, what perks you have, traits, your overall strategy etc...
•	Each Weapon & Tier also has unique *injuries* that can be done to you & the enemy.
•	These have a large impact on your & their (the enemy) abilities to fight during the battle.
•	Non-Permanent injuries will heal over time, but Permanent injuries will not.
•	There are at least over 40+ Injuries as of now (more might be added).
•	There are Legendary Weapons, too.
•	Furthermore, what you see the enemy use, you can obtain by killing them (there’s a % chance it will drop).
•	So, if you like that wicked looking 2Hander Axe, kill’em.


Armor:
•	There is a ton of Armor & armor styles.
•	There is a ton of Helmets & styles of helmets.
•	There are Armor Attachments you can buy & craft to enhance your armor
•	More Armor is not always the best.
•	There are pros/cons to wearing better armor such as weight, reduces your ability to fight long battles due to exhaustion, impairs your vision, etc…
•	There are entire Help Guides on Steam just covering these aspects of whether to go “Tank” vs “Nimble” or somewhere in between.
•	As mentioned beforehand, you get loot based upon what you are fighting.
•	You like that sick looking helmet the Undead Ancient Hnor Guard is wearing?
•	Kill it and you have a chance of getting it.
•	Like a Noble Houses’ Shields? Helmets? Kill'em & take it.


The World:
•	The world map is randomly generated via a Seed at the beginning of each game.
•	This varies the terrain, settlements, roads, ports, etc.. all over the World Map
•	The terrain on the World map impacts 
•	Each world has settlements.
•	Settlements can vary in size from a tiny village in the mountains that mines iron to huge cities with castles.
•	All of these settlements are owned by human factions.
•	There are many human factions, but only 3 will be randomly chosen for each game.
•	Settlements are where you hire your Mercs (for the most part).
•	I say, for the most part, because there are random events than can trigger certain unique situations that can allow you to recruit people.
•	Settlements are where you can buy trade goods, resupply, get quests
•	The quests are not of the caliber of Online MMO, but they are good enough (yes, they do repeat, but I am not playing for the quests).
•	They are more of a Do X, or Kill Y, protect a caravan, retrieve an item, destroy an enemy site, etc…
•	There are significant world events (Crisis) that take place (and will continue to recycles over time) that can impact the entire world map.
•	These Crisis add an additional element to the game in which Noble houses are fighting each other, undead invasions, orc & goblins combining arms to wreck the human faction settlements
•	Speaking of Settlements, you can dis/enable if the destruction is permanent or can be repaired (take care because this will make the game infinitely more difficult).
•	When you encounter enemy on the World Map, you enter Combat.
•	The combat is extremely fun & detailed.
•	As mentioned above, what level are your Mercs, what weapons, armor, traits, etc... what about your enemy? Numbers? Type? Enemy weapons/armor? Terrain?
•	When combining all of the features together this is a great game.
•	For a real challenge play on the hardest difficulty & Ironman
•	As the game is open, you can go anywhere you want.
•	If you want to go explore and attack a high level bandit hideout with only a couple of Merc with crap gear & skills, do it, but don't expect the game to protect you for your own mistakes.

For a real challenge play on the hardest difficulty & Ironman


Enemy (in short)
•	Without revealing to much, the enemy can be broken down into several categories.
•	Human, Orc, Goblin, Undead, Ancient Undead, Beasts/Monsters
•	It is the “enemy” in which there is a ‘fantasy’ element of the game, but not to much other than that.
•	Although I really love the gritty-medieval nature of the game, I do not feel that this (orcs/gobs/undead) is an issue or detracts for the medieval feel but instead I really like it.
•	Some games when they do it, it no longer feels like it is a medieval world, but instead of copy of AD&D or some other typical fantasy genre, but not in this case.


Graphics
•	I really like the graphics & I liked them from the beginning.
•	This was, for me, not something I had to “just live with”, but instead was something I felt was right from the beginning.
•	I say this because I’ve seen some comments on the art, but if you look at the level of variations of faces, hair, colors, etc…
•	For instance, just look at a single enemy “unit type” such as Goblin Ambusher…if there are 5, be sure to look at all 5 of them and they will indeed all 5 look slightly different in their camo, color schemes, pattern of armor/shape, etc…
•	This is true for any unit.
•	I love the damage models, too (as units take damage).

41,63038304,english,"This game is ridiculously hard even on the easiest settings. For this reason alone I cannot recommend this game. You may like stupidly hard games but that usually means that the game lacks actual content. This one lacks all the content that I will never access because I won't survive long enough to do so, as far as I'm concerned. I will soon not be interested enough in the first few days of a new campaign to continue playing. All RPG aspects are stupid if you're just going to kill all of my characters every few battles. All strategy is pointless if you're given no information about what works well against what. All of the battles I've seen are basically the same thing and you have no real clue how many enemies there are until you've already begun the battle. If you're outnumbered you just have to load a save game because THIS GAME PUNISHES YOU FOR ABSOLUTELY NO REASON, CONTINUOUSLY. If you haven't suffered enough, dialogs are huge walls of text and you must read them to figure out some of the quests and there isn't a TL;DR summary...so that's fun? The pay will be far from sufficient and if you click a quest icon you'll usually have to either accept that quest or loose the quest as an option. If you take the quest, you cannot take another. If you skip the quest, that'll probably eventually kill you because you'll run out of quests and starve searching for another. You might be able to improve that situation by building relations but you'll have virtually no idea or hint how to do that aside from accepting random quest until you die. Also, you're gonna starve all the damn time. If you think that you have plenty of food that just means that it'll go bad before you can eat it. Most likely, that'll happen when you're in the middle of nowhere and you'll die getting back to town. Your people will die all of the time; it's basically all they can do. Your entire army will die all of the time. All of your stupid characters will basically be the same to start with and they'll die before you can change that in any meaningful way.

Pros:
-Near endless content and thousands of map seeds make every play through unique
-Brutal but fair difficulty
-Management is a great add on to a rather ageing genre...its addicting!!!
-Diverse and practical weaponry that's not too fantasy like (not all good, but most have tactically balanced)
-Several ways to begin the game, many upping the challenge and rewards
-Great dev. team who seem to care about their game and community
-Really cool monsters and lore, with bosses that make you feel accomplished for killing. Personally love the low fantasy feel. 
Cons
-has a kinda dated look and feel (pro if your nostalgic for video games, con if your a graphics junkie)
-takes a while to get good and a feel for what character builds work
-has some bugs but none game breaking (at least from what I've encountered)

The strongest character you can make in this game can be killed twice by a single attack from the weakest enemy in this game on medium difficulty.

10/10

EDIT: For clarity's sake, I wanted to explain that this event happened (and will happen repeatedly) because of a glitched script in the game. 
The game tracks how many of your soldiers die, how many battles you get into, and how much time passes between deaths and battles. If the game decides that too much time or too many battles have passed without a sufficient number of casualties on the player's side, then the game will modify variables in the next battle you enter so as to insure that a desired number of your soldiers die.
This script will routinely glitch and cause the game to decide that your entire company needs to be killed off, meaning you will eventually enter a battle where the enemy is functionally invincible and all of your soldiers will be killed off. 
With how bad the RNG already is, I really don't see why this feature is in the game, and because the game's files are the software equivalent of a septic leak in a minefield, there is no way to just mod this script out of the game.",1580165883,1580870541,False,6,2,0.5126761794090271,1,True,False,False,76561198126680409,239,51,1494,0,441,1580866559,,

You have won the battle, except for one stubborn, well armed boss. Do you gang up on him to rob his armor, and risk losing a man?

You face a group of bandits and a necromancer. Do you hold a defensive position and send a strike team on the necromancer, knowing you could be overwhelmed? Do you try to force through the lines, knowing that the necromancer can resurrect the dead?

You are on a hill and your enemy is on a hill too. They have missile superiority, inferior front lines, and pelt you with javelins. Do you rush them, knowing you'll get hit by missiles at the bottom of the hill? Pull back and shield wall until their missiles run out, taking damage but expecting a better fight later? 

Do you set your team to be more missile heavy to hold good positions or melee heavy to win tougher fights? Do you put your archers on a hill where they can do more damage but get sniped at, or behind the front lines, where they can get enveloped?

78,30822209,english,"2019 return to Battle Brothers:
So the developers made the game more difficult, even on easy mode, I can't get past playing the first ten days in game. It's been built around save scumming and if you desire to enjoy this game you are forced to adopt this policy or you will not be able to even play on the easiest difficulty settings. 

I put in an additional 50 game play hours since my 2017 return, now in 2019 and to be honest I have not had any enjoyment on my end. Alas I must say the computer has been keenly rewarded and I hope it continues to play on without me. You know what's the point in making a game if the gamers can not get past a certain point to even see what the game has to offer. 

You have dangled the carrot in front of me for so long now, I have devalued it and no longer care to play anymore. Even if i know there is more to the game from my years of experiences in the past. I find this game to be built around save scumming and absolutely unbalanced to the point of unplayability. 

You took something I used to hold in high regard and did away with it almost over night. I can not support you in your current or future developing methods. I wish I never came back!

I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS GAME: DO NOT PURCHASE (legit gamers)

2017 Battle Brothers: 
I've enjoyed every minute of every hour that i've put into Battle Brothers. I own just about every tripple AAA game that coms out, PC/Console combined. With that said I have to admit this game is better made than those big developing companies that I shell out $100 for and end up spending a good $50 in extra boxes when in-game. I spent $30 on this game and have enjoyed this more than I ever imagined, much more than the past five AAA games put together.

Take pride in your work, don't try and appeal to every audience, and create something memorable/fun. CHECK CHECK CHECK, good job to this developing company. 

Worth a buy, can't wait to see the mods and more content roll out for this little gem. Take this game at face value for what it is and I hope you enjoy it as much as I have.

There isn't a story or anything clearly you are trying to accomplish except to make a living as a group of mercenaries.  Leveling your bros is fun.  You have choices and options for how to build out your party and equip them.   The battles have strategic depth.  There is enough diversity of enemies to keep it interesting because even if you are facing raiders in multiple fights, the terrain could be different, the gear they have changes how you approach the fight.  

The game is hard.   The first time you face each new type of enemy you will have to learn what they do and how to work around it.  Deaths or save scumming will ensue.  Personally I recommend save scumming to test various strategies.  I sometimes save before and after a battle I have won because I want to see if a different way of doing it would have been more effective.   

Ex... What if I back up 2 tiles at that start of that fight instead of staying put?

Should I rush the goblins or back up and try to separate the non-archers from the archers?

98,62621815,english,"I have a considerable amount of games in my library, more than 300, and Battle Brothers is easily one of my favorites. It's a game that brings together features from several other games that I love, like Darkest Dungeon, Mount and Blade and Final Fantasy Tactics.

It is a turn-based strategy game, in which you control a mercenary band, fulfilling varied contracts in a dark fantasy setting, in a randomly generated world. In this game you hire new members for your company, who can have all kinds of backgrounds (farmer, nobleman, swordsman, etc.), train them, equip them, and launch them into battle against bandits, undead, orcs and goblins and other terrible monsters. The game eventually descends into a major global crisis, when the game undergoes a sharp increase in difficulty, and may have three different origins: invasion of the greens, with orcs and goblins attacking human cities; invasion of the undead, with a band of undead attacking; and the war of the noble houses, when different factions that govern the world go to war with each other, and you can choose sides. Once the global crisis is over, you can retire your company and consider that run over - or you can continue, and the game going forward will become increasingly difficult, with new crises occurring and being even more complicated.

The game has a certain roguelike aspect, and you will constantly suffer from the loss of members of your company, no matter how good you are. In that sense, it is different from Darkest Dungeon, which has a learning curve that eventually puts you above these dangers. Much of this is due to the game's RNG, but it is not implemented in a way that will cruelly punish you (I think the RNG feels similar to Rimworld in that regard, if you need a comparison).

The two negative aspects of this game for me are:

1) The graphic style is a little behind everything else. I usually don't care about that, and I know that a lot is due to the developer's style choice, and that it depends a lot on individual preference, but the graphic style of this game almost stopped me from trying it out. Some people, I imagine, will enjoy it, but I believe that, given its quality in all other aspects, it could have received a little better treatment. Who knows in an eventual Battle Brothers 2?

2) The lack of support for MODs. This will definitely reduce the game's longevity. Make no mistake, there are MODs for this game. Not many, but they are cool, and show what could be achieved if the developers had chosen to offer support for creators among their fan community. I don't know exactly how it works, but I can't understand how a developer can consciously choose not to support mods. They significantly increase the longevity of games, while constantly improving their quality. If you are part of the gaming communities like Rimworld or Mount and Blade, and you play this one game, you will immediately realize the gigantic potential for mods that simply will never be fulfilled due to lack of developer support.

With that said, this game is great, a masterpiece, and you should buy it, with DLCs and everything.

I've played this game a lot and the more I play it the less I like it. The beginner difficulty is too easy and the veteran difficulty just leaves me frustrated. If I'm to believe the discussion forums I'm just bad, the game is perfectly balanced, and anyone that doesn't think so is a noob that needs to get more skills. 

You'll find yourself wondering how the enemy archers rarely miss their shots, when your archers are better off just carrying shields into battle cause return fire just isn't going to work out for you. I took on a 1 skull(easiest) caravan escort quest and ended up fighting 4 battles with tougher opponents each time until I ended up fighting a named brigand and his 14 friends and my whole company died. People will tell you this is a situation where you should just abandon the quest and flee. Thats all well and good but I get really tired of spending 20 minutes moving my characters to the edge of the map to avoid getting injuries when I retreat.

You can tell people are getting frustrated because after the most recent patch they started putting in helpful ""tips"" like ""Mercs are paid to die"" and ""Losing is fun"" to go with the actual gameplay related tips during the load screens.

The quest are your typical go to enemy base kill them and come back, follow enemy kill them then come back, watch a caravan crawl across the map kill what ever attacks you. The game is supposed to have replayability to go with its difficulty but you have to sit through the same starting fight every time and you don't get to see the map until after you've finished the first battle. I started 4 campaigns in a row before I got a map that was desirable.

Bottom line I won't be playing this game any longer, but I sunk 100+ hours into it so $.30 per hour of entertainment/frustration isn't as bad as some games I've purchased.

______________________________________________________________

Started on beginner difficulty as recommended. Got slain in my first 2-skull-mission. Watched 3 hours of YouTube tutorials and tried again. Same outcome, tried to build the perfect gang without losses on the way, but just made it a tiny bit further into the game. One battle with bad rng-gods and you are dead meat on the battlefield. 

Even save scumming didn't help - the difficulty increases with time, quite fast, not with your actual progress in game. If you at some point lost the wrong team mate, took the wrong quest, went in the wrong direction, spent gold on the wrong mercenary or item -> your game is doomed and you will loose, there is no way to fix bad luck or wrong decisions that you had/took in the past. 

This game is probably great for min-max masochists that want to learn a game and spent +100 hours in it just to increase their chances of success and the feeling of accomplishment at some point. Or for constant-save-scummers. 

It's definitely not for a casual gamer with rather limited time for gaming like me. I know that Battle Brothers celebrates to be difficult, but for me the randomness and the ever-increasing difficulty (without a chance to fix mistakes or bad luck) takes any ""fun-aspect"" out of the game. I would love to have a ""real"" beginner setting that would let you choose the difficulty, for example by entering specific areas or cities on the map. Or...to compare...take a look at Mount & Blade, which did a lot of things right in terms of difficulty settings.

A huge plus of this game: The visuals and the music are amazing. The system to set up the faces of our men (which really gives them character), the loading screens, the ""GoT-like"" soundtrack, the basic idea & concept of the game - so well made, it's absolutely impressive (and very brave!).

36,62353631,english,"Have you ever played Darkest Dungeon but wished it was more like Mount and blade? Or vice versa for that matter? Have you ever played X-com, but wished that it took place in medieval low fantasy Germany?

I love the replayability tied with the variance in character sheets and backgrounds. The amount of different fights you can take and the context they are taken in, along with random variance of what your opponents are armed with means that there are many different approaches to many different fights. Tie this with a great random map generator (Seamless tiling that makes every map look hand-drawn by a professional cartographer) and every run is a vibrant world with its own economy.

People will complain about the RNG, but randomness is part of the philosophy with these sorts of tactical managment simulators. The randomness is an abstraction for everything you the player character/tactitian can never be directly responsible for. It is very important to understand the philosophy behind the 95% hit is a %5 miss system, as this ensures that any time you enter combat, you must always accept some kind of risk for entering combat, and you must be willing to live with the consequences of your actions. The fact that random situations can always introduce themselves, it keeps the game fresh as you must always have to react to choices presented to you, even if you weren't in the mood for them, thats what makes it dramatic. The fact that a brother missed a 95% swing is in a sense ""his"" fault, but it is your fault if you put pressure on him to make that swing or DIE, and it is your fault if you panic and make a tactical error based off of this result.

I love the flavour of the game world. The morally grey dark fantasy theme of being unscrupulous/schlubby mercenaries thrown into a world of ghosts and goblins kind of plays to the comedy of being outmatched and facing permadeath. Your men have no magical powers, and instead must use tactics to outsmart the AI. The ludonarration fits so well to allow you to gain attachments to your brothers and even settlements and noble houses themselves. The game even has details such as that noble family characters of the same house all share the same hair colour; or that the fantasy monsters are named after convential german names from folklore. There are so many personal touches the game has even though it is all presented through emergent random generation that keep this game highly addictive and replayable.",1579913988,1579913988,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,76561197972354751,286,2,35394,48,23203,1601720627,,

While not perfect because of late game grind and repetition it still manages to hit most of the the right spots for me. And the tactical gameplay is brutal and addictive. Battle Brothers is realistic, low fantasy mercenary band simulator, i would roughly describe as a mix of JA2 and Mount&Blade.

The game is randomly generated at start. You begin with a small roster, take contracts, hire more mercs, kill enemies, loot and in time build stronger company. And with stronger company you can take on more powerful enemies and attempt to loot fabled locations for great rewards. Keeping your company strong is also crucial for surviving late game crises like orc invasion. Permadeath system is very harsh, so be ready to lose your mercs or get them crippled. I like overall feeling of the game otherwise i wouldn't have bothered with such difficulty. 

The game is a freeplay based. There are no main quest etc. While contracts tend to get repetitive tons of events will keep you entertained. Some might even provide great benefits.


2018. Despite their statement about moving away from further development after release, to everyone's surprise Overhype announced an upcoming dlc\expansion called Beasts and Exploration. It should adress some of the issues and add more variety, enemies and weapons into the game.

This game is hard and will make you pay for your mistakes. 

Your brothers WILL die if not positioned well in the battlefield and it's permanent. You do get to keep their equipment but lose all that work you put into them. There are now different starting styles thanks to some updates from the developers. The dlc's are great and they are coming out with another one sometime middle/end of 2020.

This game is pretty brutal and bloody and I love that and the little characters can meet a very gruesome end much to my enjoyment. The writing in the game is very funny and there are some good quest to find and Legendary loot to equip your brothers with.

Update 3 years later: 

Battle Brothers is an absolute Gem of a game.  Carefully designed and put together, it's for those with a problem solving approach to gaming. 

Surprisingly beautiful art, great satisfaction to see all weapons and armor come alive on your mercenaries, and a perfectly balanced game experience to build your very own small army. 

The DLCs so far have greatly improved the experience, and the mod community out there is also stellar. 

Cannot recommend enough! 343 hours in and many more to come.

p.s. I also use it together with Netflix. Watch some series on the left side of my screen play the game on the right. The ability to pause at any point in the game means I can focus on the series when they action is high.",1512477412,1579262506,True,5,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,76561198043295788,252,4,29177,0,2704,1599937007,,

Very deep and satisfying tactical combat. Quite a hard game but the harder the fight, the sweeter the victory. Really good replay value, especially since the latest DLC with the origins options.

42,60758696,english,"Battle Brothers is not as much of a 'hard' game as it is frustrating. It's funny how the Devs market this game. They say: ""This game is a hard game! You should get used to dying because that's part of the game."" Which is fine with me. I like hard games. I've played this same type of game in the past. Except this game in particular is poorly designed and hides a lot of the information you need to play the game effectively from your view, such as the movement range of your enemy and the abilities of their equipment, which you have to memorize because of this because the game won't tell you off handedly when you need to know in the midst of battle. The computer knows all of this and relentlessly takes advantage of it. It will specifically place its units outside of your movement range and refuse to engage in battle until they can land the first hit by default. So the game is punishing you for information you aren't provided by the game.

It also hard punishes you for if you ever let your unarmored archers get in range of the opponent by not allowing them to retreat without giving the opponent a high chance for a free hit while at the same time canceling out their retreat move. ((???)) Now. Let's take a moment and examine how stupid this is. In a physical fight, what is the opponent going to do if you turn around and run away? They're going to chase after you. They are not going tap into the force from Star Wars to draw you back in and stab you in the back. That's just idiotic. Yet this is how retreating in this game is modeled. So the game pushes you into the direction of having a lot of heavily armored troops because of this and if you watch all of the Youtube videos for this game, NO ONE uses ranged troops. It's essentially written out of the game if you want to win. And I don't want to play heavily armored troops, so why bother playing it?

I tried to love this game. I wanted to love this game. But the game doesn't tell you so many things when you need to know it. Take for example the Adrenaline perk. It's a perk you can take for leveling up your character that explicitly states: ""This ability allows for your character to move first before everyone else in the next round."" Oh! Awesome. So you take that ability. Except the game didn't tell you that when you try to use it in battle, the ability generates a 20 fatigue cost, which is insane for the benefits you get and often prevents you from even attacking that round. So you've taken an effectively useless ability because the game didn't tell you about that before you took the ability during the level up!

I cannot recommend this game to anyone and I warn people against buying it. This game is spammed with positive kickstarter reviews of people trying to justify their purchase. Look at their gametime and judge their reviews carefully.",1577545989,1577638347,False,5,1,0.462135940790176392,3,True,False,False,76561197999146291,225,8,1317,0,948,1577963775,,

91,60406419,english,"There is something magical about Battle Brothers. It touches upon many aspects that come together nicely. It is somewhat reminiscent of table top wargaming (i.e., Warmachine), board gaming, and many computer turn based strategy games. 

Part of the fun of Battle Brothers comes from the seemingly endless strategic customization between character stats, traits and weapons. 

The game takes a long time to fully understand its strategic and economic nuances. 

For me, I have the most fun in the beginning and middle game where I am building my brotherhood--there is a lot more on the line during the battles. My company could easily be wiped or I got a little too cocky with a star bro I was babying to level up because of amazing stats.  

RNG. People complain about it. I see it as enhanced realism. In war even a lowly poacher's arrow may, by Odin's guiding hand, slide perfectly into an armored knight's face by seemingly mere chance. The lesson I've learned from RNG is that don't become overly fond of any bro. See the company as one unit rather than as 12-20 individual bros. Manage the unit and you'll do fine. Bend over backwards for a few bros that you think are heaven sent--you'll be save scumming your way to the late game. 

I learned on expert combat / easy economy. This is a good way to learn. It teaches you to be strategic without having to worry as much about the economy (which can be a real problem). Lastly, there are tons of amazing guides. You will have to read them. I didn't at first. I wish I had. I would have saved many frustrating hours. I now play on Ironman / expert / expert.

The combat is very satisfying, the sound design is on point and the general structure of the quests doesn't ever really feel tiresome. You'll notice that dialogue gets recycled after about twenty hours, but even though there's a serious lack of writing, there isn't a lack of things that could happen to you on any given assignment.

The three most common jobs are 1) Escort/deliver this item(carrier) 2) Go here and get this item and 3) Go kill  these dudes.

Despite that, I don't remember feeling *bored*. I usually end up giving this game a rest either because I get slightly frustrated with some bad luck (which doesn't feel unfair) or because things seem to be taking too long (which is now avoidable with new options.)

So long as you understand that this game is hard at the best of times and that you can't see the soldiers you hire as anything other than high-risk financial investments, you'll be fine. The team you assemble can feel super individual and alive, but if you lose too many guys it'll be difficult to remember everyone's name. People's faces tend to blur together after awhile, since there's only so much variance you can have with muscular white men.

There are also some content mods, but in my opinion they are yet lacking in quality, the art doesn't mesh well with the existing game art and the balance is a bit off, but it does exist if you want it.

17,60041896,english,"I was convinced to buy this game because of the comparisons to xcom and mount and blade. After playing a few hours i find that to be an offensive statement.

The game is punishing..but not in the good tactical way.  Not like xcom or M&B.  It punishes you simply for playing, regardless of difficulty you will die..all the time.  Most of that is because you will never know what you are facing.   You will never know the composition of your enemy units etc until you are already engaged in the fight.

The economy is brutally simple, there is little strategy to be found there.

The interface is clunky and requires significant manual micromanagement.  Equipment and inventory is vanilla.

From the other reviews it sounds like you just need to put in 200 or 300 hours dying and reading wiki and you'll ""get it"".  That might very well be true.

This is not a balanced game to the point that it is not a fun game.

If you are one of those masochists who like a game that provides little to no information and punishes you at every turn then you have found your game.

For me this game lacks depth and balance.   The path to success is grinding for hundreds of hours in a game with bad graphics and a terrible map and travel system.  It is nothing it advertises to be.

Build a lineup of gruff looking killers from various backgrounds, and specialize them in front line melee, polearms, or ranged weapons. Customize weapons and armor, trying to balance practicality with effectiveness and general coolness.

Guide your troops in battle, and develop the best strategy for beating hordes of undead to common brigands. Prepare to cry as your best lads get slaughtered by lucky crossbow shots or have their faces torn off by wild wargs. Seriously, battles are enough to make the most patient strategists ragequit.

Have fun recruiting a new guy just to figure out he's an asthmatic with terrible stats (who cost you more gold than you can make in three days.)",1456423463,1575842686,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198054080636,132,47,10418,0,6791,1598494035,,
63,59522009,english,"I really felt like i need to write something about game after 500+ hrs. First of all i haven´t heard anything about game when  was buying it and i never ever buy a game without strong recommendations either from friends or from internet. I saw it was on sale, it looked interesting. i made a litte bit of searching about it then i decided to buy it. And oh my... what a blast. It was actually the game i was seaching for a long time. 

You are leading a mercenary company. There are different starts you can choose from and every start has their advantages and disadventages. You can start as Beasthunters like Witcher style and hunt beasts, you can start as peasants whom decided to protect themselfs, you can start as psycho Cultists and sacrifece your own men to your dark god and many more. Every map generates randomly at beginning(Or you can search for map seeds from internet) and you start your journey. I must say it is a really hard game. Even if you are really experienced with turn based combat RPG genre, i would recommended to start with beginner difficulty and definitely not ironman. Even beginner difficulty is really hard and expect to lose some men and even game at beginning. I played 524 hrs when i write this review but probebly +100 hrs to watch videos and read forums. Comminity is really friendly and you can learn everything you need to learn. It is a really hard to learn game but it is pretty easy to master after you learn the mechanics. AI has no joke it is ruthless. It is gonna destroy you if you go a fight unprepared or even if you prepared sometimes. Every enemy has different ways to fight but it is pretty reliable if you know what you are doing. There are no private skills in game. Skills comes with weapons you use and you need to use different weapons for different fights. Of course you can specialize one of your man with certain weapon too.

About your men, you mostly start with 3 bros and you recruit more on the way. There are lots of different background. Swordmaster to disowned noble, bastard to ratchacher or minstrel. There are tons of background and every man you see come with their own small story with their background. That is why you feel more immersed and fell a connection with your men. Some backgrounds allow you to act different on some events and get you some variety on your gameplays. To be honest none of my campaigns were same. Even after 500+ hrs. The game looks pretty minimalistic but the depth of the game come with textes. They are soooo good writen and some of them are amazingly smart. One time we see two kids trying to rescue a cat and my bowmen help them to get the cat with shooting the branch. After kids get the cat they said ""oh finally something to eat now"".

One feature game offers are Famed(Named) items. They are the items that extremely strong but also extremely rare. They are so hard to find and it is even harder to get them. For a singleplayer game that it is actually suprising. But since they are pretty rare it makes endgame so much fun. You mostly listen tavern rumors or search for some champions.


There are so much to write still but at END i can say it is pretty hard to learn and it is not for everybody. If you are not ready or in mood for learning a game it is not for you becouse it really is not easy. But if you search a game to focus and make reseach and learn, learn, learn(and lose lots of time) it is an exciting game. I would recommenden it 10/10 and thank to the indie studio, who made this beatiful game.",1575838669,1575838669,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198078092557,91,7,104225,8061,31437,1602090631,,

74,59430229,english,"Strategy, character-based, turn-based, development, sandbox, I play a lot of games of these genres and Battle Brothers is a game consisting all of them so my review of this game comes with a lot of experience, and I also in general hold really high standards for a game.

This game is for you if you like a challenging strategy (what to do for the company as a whole, what fights to take, how to spec up the brothers etc) or tactical (how to actually win the battles) game, as well as development / sandbox game, as it is very satisfying to see your company grow from a band of 3 guys with cloth armour that barely hits their attacks to a band of veterans wearing high tier armour and able to defeat the enemies that you had been losing to or winning with heavy losses for a long time.

This game is a really good, solid and fun game with huge replayability. The game feels immersive and you develop connection with certain brothers (the core brothers that you protect from) and when they do something insane or die they create strong memorable moments for each playthrough. The game is so good that I actually bought a DLC in full price for it which I have not done at any point before for all other games.

It is a very difficult and challenging game, and without any guides to start you off you will die a lot. But through experiencing losing and losing a lot, you eventually become prepared for the game and you will find it really fun, and then you face even tougher enemies in mid-late game and you experience losing brothers and learn to beat them better next time, perhaps with gear you gained in initial bloody victories over them.

Healing takes a few days, so reserves can be useful, especially with sieges against multiple troops.

92,38764274,english,"Final Review: 2017 Xmas Purchase Review Battle Brothers was a game I had my eye on for some time. The question was what can I add that others have mentioned and would recommend you getting it or not. That depends. Are you a masochist? Are you into death, maiming, and killer rabbits, If so, then despite it’s flaws Battle Brothers does accomplish what it set out to do. Make a medieval rpg, where you care for your head case minis. Let’s get to it, just in case you’re on the bubble to getting this game of not
PROS:
Game play: OOOh my lord, that axe just made that mini splat! Ahuhahahaaaa I like it, kind of feeling when your minis destroy their targets. My point is your smart tactical play pays off.
Graphics: Like the old Nintendo RPGS with roaming lands a plenty and free space to take a quest, get coin, and beer! Yep hit the check mark. 
Risk: Wait a game where I don’t feel the entire world is on my shoulders. Hurray! 
Economic: Supply and demand, constant equipping and maintenance of my band, and all this was missing was that song I sing as I travel along. ""This is the song that doesn’t end…and it goes on and on my friend."" Ah enemy unit, Have at thee! Hahahahhaaaa! Got it -Check mark.
Presentation: Upgrading units, perks, traits, stat percentage allocation, with simple navigation and easy game functions. What more can you ask for, ok...yes, more, but what can I tell ya. You may get that with more additions.
Additions: I do think a great template to build on, add more and more content and more tactical options.
Aesthetics: Caravans leading to legendary items, Taverns gossip and great morale boost, How to switch weapons mid fight to earn great items, proper specific builds that use their job trait, like a Thief Dagger killer with high dodge, or HeadHunter w Flails, how to buy low and sell high, yes those copper and goat cheese matter. Proper trait allignment. Take notes, know your towns and cities and how to use your inventory. So much deeper than just roaming. 
CONS:
College: Sorry there are some, very complicated game with rules and a brutal learning curve. It will frustrate even the most expert player, and anger the beginners. You may start over again and again early if you don't learn fast. Why you ask, because of the lack of tutorial. Though I see there are more added, and discussion helps. You should not have to go to school for an hour before you play. Con for me, However, once you truly learn. You will go batty.
Graphics: Its simplistic strength is also its vast weakness. I wish this was more like Mordheim or Dungeons and Dragons in its modeling execution. The fact that its hex isometric and old style hurts its over all visionary outlook. As a player, you never feel fully engaged in the storyline and the lack of inner game beauty hurts the over all appeal. You want to draw the player inside the game. Not watch overhead. For example, the Hill up and down option is counter productive and annoying. A feature the player should never have had to worry about. Who knows, maybe BB2 will be vastly more developed in its look and appeal. 
UI: The lack of voice overs, flashes, and story modes can make reading things for the vision impaired a nightmare. Would have liked to see a UI overall customization added to make small text and numbers that are so small more visual to the eye. What was that percentage hit number, 17? Make that huge man, wear are my mag glasses. The fact that you really do not see the traits in play hurt. 
Grind: There is a redundancy that plays too safe for this game, ok I got it, mission, walk over, slice-slice, collect, ok mission, walk over, hack-hack, and on and on that will eventually make players go elsewhere. Game needed more depth and story complexity. 
Design: The inventory can get a little clunky and disorganized and even moving it into order can get tedious. Darn it I had all my food in a row. Why you! There is too much opening and closing of screens for my liking. Having a sort helps but takes away the organized gamer. That may not be a good thing when you accidently BUY something THREE times because you didn't know you already had it.  
Multi player: It is a con for me. If any game has the potential for Multi player option its Battle brothers. I could have seen 4-8 player matches and the fact that it does not have a multi player option hurts. However, that could change in the future with additional content or the next version of the game. Some may not care about Multi player, not for everyone, but a nice option to consider. 
OVERALL: Battle Brothers is a fun game. It has a lot of fun things that if you have the time will get you pumped. For a first-time developer a nice effort and a game that can be built on. I do think other developers will pick this up and even under another theme do it and execute it vastly superiorly, but Battle Brothers does get the blood going. I would recommend seeing the VIDEO above discussion to see the actual gameplay before you buy. I would also caution, Battle Brothers is like going to the carnival, going to the whack a mole machine, except when you hit them, they explode to goo. Something parents may get turned off on for their younger kids. Teens and Adults will not care, but youngies? Don't say I did not warn ya lads!  Battle Brothers gets the bloody job done.

0,59176331,english,"Battle Brothers is one of the best examples on Steam of the Early Access program working. I watched this game start off, not work at all on my computer, and then grow into an extremely well functioning game that has delivered on all the promises it made. Not gonna lie, I feel great having backed this game because it absolutely worked out well. I've clearly devoted a lot of time to it and gotten well worth my money for it. That isn't to say it's perfect by any means. There's a list of things that the fanbase would love to see which we may not, there are things about the game that don't feel optimal and there will always be a desire for more of something that is enjoyable, but seeing it accomplish what it has I think is more than we often get. 

So what are some of those things it does so well? 1) Great setting, it feels familiar but has enough of it's own things going on that make it interesting. 2) Combat feels visceral and it has serious impacts and isn't insurmountable to get a hang of. This isn't a ""go be a god and mow down people"" game, but it is still a game you can get strong and dominate if you put in the time to learn. 3) Openness is certainly present in the sense that, there's no railroad here. You get to go where you want to go and figure things out or keep the game going however you want to. There isn't a whole lot to do here other than travel and fight, for sure, but it being a game about Mercenaries, I think that's fine. It would be nice if there was some other activities to break up the fighting but what it does do, which is the most important factor, it does right and well. 4) Story is focused just enough on to make the progress meaningful without becoming distracting or detracting, I appreciate that. Also, the flavor bits between group members or you get while you're exploring are lots of fun and seems well crafted. 5) Depth - Battle Brothers is a game you can get the sense of very quickly while at the same time it's going to probably take a long, deep dive to really get a grasp on the whole breadth of things to do or how to best take advantage of this or that. And, even when you do get a sense of everything, mastery (which usually leads to boredom) is by no means an inevitability or guarantee of ease.  6) Art, design and music are all very charming and pleasant while also being realistic enough to not become cartoonish. It strikes a very difficult mid-spot between comfy and gritty that works incredibly, at least imo. 

So, should you buy this game? I would definitely, obviously, say yes. In the past 3 years since it's release, Overhype have put out several great and low cost dlcs even when they had initially wanted to focus more on other projects. And, hopefully, they'll put out more eventually. I think with the success the game has had, a sequel isn't out of the question, or at least I hope not, and it's always nice to have experienced the earlier version before trying out the new stuff. If the game looks good to you, pick it up. This is an example of a small studio coming through on all their promises, delivering a great work while listening to their fanbase and now one of the best games of it's kind.",1575412783,1575412783,True,24,1,0.744375348091125488,0,True,False,False,76561198068028355,432,24,49774,3872,45573,1602046092,,

3,33734834,english,"This is the best turn based game I have played. One of the best things about this game is the detail in how enemies are programmed. The types of enemies in the game are very dynamic and they all behave relatively to how you'd expect them to, for example- goblins are quick and clever, they are like little pygmy hunters after large prey. They are glass cannons, so when you get the upper hand against them, they break and run. Another example is how the beast type enemies will charge straight at spears or make poor decisions while human enemies will make calculated decisions and go around spear walls or break them with shields and other things like protecting their units that are vulnerable to ranged.

This game is fantastically balanced. The way to succeed in this game is simply understand what your current  unit is capable of. Before the DLC's, there were a few metas that made leveling unbalanced, but they changed it so it's a lot more dynamic in viable choices now,  you can  make some really unique mercs in playstyle.

The gameplay itself is the best part of this game.  I would compare it to chess, which is simplifying it, but battles are so dynamic and  always unique. The way weapons work and how units move and everything else...  all the factors  that go into battle feel so natural and right... Philosophically, this game gets EVERYTHING right.

I don't need to explain how aesthetically pleasing this game is to the senses. This is an original game made by authentic, original, and creative people.

Administration of the company involves buying food, equipment weapons and management of your comrades in arms.

The heart of the game is of course the combat. This is handled on a tactical level with turn based movement of  individual mercenaries. The combat system includes morale, damage to armor and stamina. The system includes the benefits from flanking and stunning an opponent (which can also happen to your soldier). Multiple weapons from simple clubs and slings to more exotic weapons are covered.

However combat in the game is unforgiving -loosing a man you have built up from a recruit is common.

This game is near limitless ... you can play for maximum power by save scumming or simply roll the dice of random by playing iron man mode to test your meddle. Simple put how long can or will you survive!!   Either style very enjoyable.

I am hoping for two additional installments to make this game flawless in my opinion:

#1  I am hoping the next expansion if there is a next expansion allows you to design your own banner with a creation tool.  I think as you gain renowned and become something titled LEGENDARY you should have the resources to create a banner to boost morale or cause fear ... am I right !!! 

#2  I am hoping there will be an enchanters expansion allowing for magic using mercenaries that can tap into necromancy or summoning.   Imagine conjuring a spider or a wolf to fight with you ...Am I right!!   Or perhaps enchanting like a ""wind guide"" spell to slighty improve ranged accuracy for a round or two ... or ""wind storm"" for that matter to penalize the enemy!!

Well instead of carefully thought out tactics, you're supposed to zerg with many units like pawns on a chess board?

There's no progression, you're fighting huge battles in the first hour of the game.

Hit % is wrong, you never land shots that should land. Actually, it feels rigged.

Enemies will take a free shot at you if you're moving away or around them to try and get a better hit %. Apparently it works in your favor too. Worst game mechanic in this game, which is a turn based tactics, except all units can possibly take turns outside of their turn. Not even a skill or special training is needed for this. Gee whiz.

The units you hire have peasant gear weaker than the first bandits you fight.

You start with enough gold to hire 12 units which is one of the first contracts, but you don't have enough gold to make up for any losses you suffer.

Suddenly you have no supplies and no gold and your units are leaving the group.

The contracts offer miserable amounts of gold that don't supplement losses.

Better know everything you're doing up front.

Go study the game online before you ever play.

I really like the storytelling and text content though.

Tis a shame...

I'll start a new campaign and give it another shot, but this is not looking good for my first 4 hours in a game.

It lacks a basic tutorial, there are scenarios that will teach you some combat techniques but not one for the base game, like ""this is where you get a contract. It needs a little polish, camping, how about an option to camp until the men are fully healed instead of just camping and checking the men and camping some more? Maybe I missed something there but if I did then that's all the more reason for a tutorial. Men need even more varied backgrounds, there are many that I've seen already but I don't like seeing 2 fishermen with the exact same back story.. Maybe a difficulty option too, it's not easy and some will love that but some won't :)


All of that said, I highly recommend this game. It's good now and should have a really great future.

This became my favorite game! It's brutal but when you are successful your feeling of accomplishment is incredible. It take a good time investment to learn it, I'd say 100+ hours of play just to be a fair player and at over 500 hours I am still learning new things with each play through.

Your journey will be emotional especially if you play Ironman mode, because you could see a brother die instantly, whether that be by the hand of an Orc axe strike or by the unlucky landed arrow in his face! Pride will visit your gaming session when your company of brothers lines up for battle, each piece of gear having been hard earned and each man's life on the line. You will eventually recall the names of the fallen that fought so bravely. 

So its not the AAA graphics and big screen drama, but it is an endearing and addictive game play. I could go in to a lot of detail about strategic depth and variety, but I know there are good guides on the community hub of which I have noticed are always happy to help and answer those frustrating questions. Yes there is some frustration in this game, especially with the talents. I find them to be good options for your own creations, or you can just go with those archetypes already planned out in the game guides. There is no one fit all solution, and that is where a lot of the creative choice filters in to the game. Each brother has his own background and potential, one might be a good archer, another perhaps a good future duellist? Experiment with options and see them fail and succeed. Alternatively just look at the guides and try what has stood the test of time.

Note, this game will teach you the concept of the need to retreat when necessary. Be prepared to use the retreat order and live to fight another day!

18,56196203,english,"Addictive and enjoyable. Also rage inducing :)

The narrative during the game is well written and enjoyable, adding to the immersion. You lead a band of mercenaries (Sellswords) around a randomly generated map doing contracts for villages, towns and nobles, as well as exploring to take on groups of wandering enemies and the ruins/structures dotted about. Hopefully you gain more money than you spend and can afford more recruits and better gear because the enemies will gradually get harder and more numerous.

You'll die alot (well, perhaps not on Beginner difficulty, which it suggests for new players to the game, but certainly on higher difficulties), and you'll lose men along the way. All part of the lifestyle. You'll also pull your hair out as you watch your team crumble against their foe and know it's probably time to retire your team of 'genetically diverse' men and start afresh, armed with better knowledge and a solid want for revenge.

There's alot of attention to detail in this game, including things like faces and armour getting more battered as they take damage, and I particularly liked the first time I destroyed an enemy zombie's helmet, leaving his bald head showing with mushrooms growing out of it. Alot of nice touches in Battle Brothers that game devs usually gloss over.

The music's good and fits the different situations well. The first time I fought against undead and didn't know what tricks they had up their sleeves, it was in a forest at night. I was outnumbered and wondering what was in store, while the music that played was foreboding and hinting that I might be joining the undead. Not going to lie, I was impressed.

Which leads me to the enemies. They're diverse and well thought out, each type and sub-type with their own interesting mechanics that require different tactics to minimise injury or loss of life. The fighting is always interesting and involves strategy in all aspects.

There are things which aren't entirely perfect, like sometimes you'll get wiped through no true fault of your own, but you kinda get used to what you need to avoid doing, and don't be afraid to run from a battle or turn down a contract if need be. You can always reload, but I'd recommend playing in Ironman Mode if you want full immersion.. that's really what the game was designed for, methinks.

Anyway, the game does alot of things right and I think it's worth every penny. If you like Mount & Blade, I'm pretty sure you'll like this.

36,57792031,english,"The reason why I'm giving this game a negative review is mainly to counteract the ""overwhelmingly positive"" reputation it currently has on Steam, since there isn't a ""neutral"" option.

Don't get me wrong, I had my share of fun playing this and I still do, from time to time. But let's go to the main flaw(s):

It's RNG-heavy. RNG is actually the [i] entire core [/i] of the combat system. The results of a given battle can range from crushing defeat to glorious victory based entirely on the roll of a dice, no matter how strategic your thinking was. And I understand the implied difficulty on that system: you build your characters and take decisions to try and maximize the chance of a positive outcome, but more often than not you just face 3 situations:

1- Very good dice rolls on your side: it leaves a ""no-accomplishment vibe"" which doesn't enrichen your playing experience.
2- Well-rounded rolls for both parties: the best there is. A sense of fairness.
3- Terrible rolls for you: the worst, obviously. If you are playing ironman, you just gotta start the game all over again. If you aren't, you reload your save just to do the exact same things and try to get in the situations 1 or 2. Without any change in tactics.

I believe the game could have been built on a better thinking platform but perhaps this was the easiest or more convenient way to do things. On the other hand, the game is quite nice on the AI part, events etc, while feeling slightly bland on variety of equipment and builds.

Two problems occured to me :
_the contract system seems very random and not following your progress. That limits the experience. For a strong company you can still get dumb contracts you don't want, and try to find some others elsewhere, and they may be as dumb. That lead to ressource consumption. 
_the contract's ""difficulty"" is weird and probably broken... I had a very skillfull company taking a 1 level contract for goblins. Quite easy, I needed the money, so let's go. They decimated my company when I had absolutely no problem dealing with goblins the all game. And they were 10 when I was 12. And just before I did some hard level 3 contract for nobles with a siege, with knights and other skillfull fighters and fights in a row.

Battle Brothers however is really its own thing, which is smart because there's no way it could compete with Mount and Blade. The combat is surprisingly exciting and satisfying.  Despite lacking animations it still feels heavy and impactful.

75,57499384,english,"You, the player, are the commander of a band of mercenaries. A pitiful, sad, very mortal band of mercenaries, each man with their own minor background and prone to horrific, permanent injuries. You and your men will be chopped down again and again, and you might wonder why you're choosing to put yourself through RNG-based torture. Personally, I'm a great fan of the Black Company series of books by Glen Cook, and your headcanon as well as personal stories you think up for each character is part of the appeal of the game. 

The meat of the game is separated into turn-based battles on a hex grid and world-map exploration.

The turn-based battles are a hex-grid based affair, with combat being unavoidable in the game: you will fight, fight some more, lose mercenaries left and right, and eventually become an unstoppable army once you become well-equipped enough. If you're not a fan of the combat, you will not be a fan of the game. I advise watching some gameplay videos to see if it bores you. What you see is unequivocally what you get. There are no complex animations in the game, nor is it particularly pretty, though I find the art-style appealing and the combat animations quite satisfying despite their simplicity. The battles themselves can get repetitive once you've reached a medium level of knowledge of game mechanics. You'll know exactly what formations and equipment work the best against different enemy types, and even how to exploit their rather easy to defeat AI. A certain mod (Legends) and DLC varies the enemy types, rewards and crafting system. While it is in beta, I have found it to be quite stable and allows you to customize your experience with more variety of band-starts that cater to different player difficulties. 

All mercenaries and enemies have an action point resource that movement and attacks both draw from, with heavier weapons costing more action points. Every hit is RNG based, and can be improved up to 95% hit probability, but most low-level and low-talent mercs start unspecialized and will not be hitting a lot of things, even with some weapons that increase hit chance. If you grind out the most skilled fighter on the talent and give him the best equipment, he will still miss sometimes: and even die as a result, though that can be circumvented via good positioning and planning. If that possibility frustrates you, you may rage quit. Your chief fighter can even obtain a random injury from a random event the eve before a scripted, many-person battle, and though it is not common, this can cause him to be ineffectual. Ineffectual enough that half your band gets slaughtered. Oh, and he happened to kill your other chief fighter by caving in his skull with a helm during that same text event. I find this part of the game's charm. 

While save-scumming is a thing that will prevent this chain of events from happening, I am not a fan of it: it renders the game into a min-maxing experience where you will save-scum for the best recruits in a town, save-scum for legendaries to be generated on enemies, and save-scum your way into boredom. Ruins replayability- I would know, I did it for a few hours.

The map is randomly generated, labelled by a seed ID (which can be reused), where you will pick and choose your contracts and battles, and occasionally be ambushed as a result of some random event, having a statistically weaker army or having a bad reputation with factions. Some maps are better than others, so you may want to use a 'good' seed found by someone else (better town + city placement, favorable starting talent). There are always 11 'legendary' locations to discover and explore, with their own flavor text and events, which can range from loot, a quick adventure, or grueling battles that will destroy your band. Other than this, there are numerous randomly generated locations (battles) that will pop up, due to in-game events (such as an invasion causing that enemy type to pop up quite frequently as roving bands or bases) or being generated as a result of taking a specific contract. 

The actual factions and villages have a reputation system, but I found it mostly lacking in terms of character. Once you've read one type of contract's flavor text, you've pretty much read them all. The writing isn't bad at all: but there is no depth offered to factions other than being quest-givers and targets in one of three late-game mega events (each one being their own world-map spanning crisis). Another issue some may find with the game is that there is scarcely any character development, other than the RPG mechanics of skilling up stats and obtaining abilities. While there's a plethora of events, and I doubt I've encountered every event, there's a lot of unfulfilled potential here for narrative depth. I still grew an attachment to some characters as a result of seeing them in several events and having them with me long enough, but it's not enough to maintain your interest for much more than 100 hours if you grow weary of the combat. 

Once you've beat each late game crisis (there are 3) on Ironman mode at above veteran difficulty, and explored every legendary location, you might have it in you for one more full playthrough before you have to put the game down. For the price, I think the ~120 hours I got out of the game (adding hours spent playing offline) is very worth it. As a general tip, to prevent completely wiping your band and starting the game over (especially on ironman), you should retreat. Very liberally, especially if a battle starts to turn south for whatever reason. Once you're in a good enough position and have abandoned your weaker brothers to die: hit the retreat button. Relying on RNG to carry you through the rest of the battle can work, but it's better to cut and run than to lose 10+ hours of ironman progress (equipment, gold, etc): you can always hire more mercs.",1574201332,1574201345,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198340403668,67,2,4789,0,4789,1574132780,,

I was pleasantly surprised by this. On the surface it seems like another shallow tactical RPG made artificially stupid hard so you constantly pray to RN-Jesus. But it really does channel that old school tabletop feel of Chainmail and 0-edition D&D. Those games were basically expanded wargame rules, where battles regularly involved dozens or hundreds of units, your characters were vulnerable and expendable, and only a few were lucky enough to rise up to true hero status. Every victory is a triumph, every contract is a fortune.

Battle Brothers is essentially the same concept; motivated by treasure and fame your humble party will do heroic deeds and become respected warriors, but not without plenty of casualties along the way so you must learn early on not to get attached to your men.

My negatives involve poor UI decisions. For example, to repair a piece of gear you need to take it off your character, repair it, and remember to put everything back on everyone the way you had it. Also if your archer switches to a melee weapons in battle, he will not switch back after the battle. You must do it manually or else he will start the next battle with his melee weapon and have to waste actions switching back to his bow.

And unfortunately it seems development has ceased for now.

This leads to a quick increase of my renown and thus to a quick adaption of the game itself towards a state where I run into hordes of enemies against which I don't stand a chance. And if I'm too careful and don't find enough lucrative fights I run out of money and food.

23,56577627,english,"I'm really enjoying this game. I like tactical turn based combat where you control a small squad, I like challenges where you have to think really hard or you will die, and I like having an additional resource management, strategic side of things which you use to improve your chances in the tactical battles. I don't mind a random number generator. If you're playing it right then there should be ways to win even when you're a little bit unlucky.

So yes, this is basically XCom in a medieval fantasy world, where you control a small band mercenaries and you have to struggle to keep them alive and get to the stage where you might be able to think about something else other than your next meal, being able to pay your troops and not getting your skull caved in by a zombie.

And- I really can't emphasise this enough- this game is hard. Really, really hard. It says on the load page that you should play it on easy, even if you're used to this style of game, but I ignored that. I've spent thousands of hours on this kind of game, I thought, it will be fine. So I played through the tutorial, such as it is, and then I died. Using the DLC, I played through it again as three norse warriors, and I died before I'd even made it to the south of the map, (where not everyone wanted to kill me). I played the same start again, and was so desperately short of cash that I made the fatal mistake of stealing some gems from the caravan I was supposed to be protecting, which might have kept me alive in the short term but left me very dead in the medium term. So I think it took me three games on Veteran difficulty before I'd even made it out of the first week, and even then I got crushed.

I've now been playing a different start, as caravan guards, which gives you a slightly easier time with money at the start, and I am now finally getting towards the end game, or at least the end of the middle game, where contracts pay enough and my merry band are dangerous enough that I can hope to maintain a roster of twelve soldiers and pick up a bit of extra cash. It was a revelation when I realised that you're supposed to keep your men in a line of two, so that men with polearms and missile weapons can attack from the second row while in the front row men with shields take the initial impact and block arrows.

And even then, you can't get cocky. The last contract I took, the terrain for the battle was bad (we were fighting in a swamp), which made movement difficult, and what should have been a fairly easy battle turned into an absolute slaughter. I lost four men, a third of my company, and it was touch and go whether I was going to win the battle at all. I lost my most experienced soldier, who'd been with me since nearly the start of the game.

So you can't get too attached to your soldiers. They will die, especially on higher difficulty levels. They'll get horribly maimed; they'll get decapitated. However I think I have enough experienced remaining men and enough spare equipment to kit out some new recruits so they don't die as soon as the enemy breathe on them, that I think I can recover from here. Although I believe I'm due an End Game crisis fairly soon...

So if you like that sort of challenge, I think you'll like this game. But seriously consider starting it on an easier difficulty level.

1. Can feel grindy. Sure there is some progression but it has long pauses through it. And lots of the same missions. ""Kill X"" or ""Protect Y"", none of which has any deep value. Events don't happen often enough in vanilla, so getting to know your troop is hard without out of game make believe. The gameplay itself is good, but basically making you want to continue to the next fight, or car about what little story, can be hard at times.

2. Mod support isn't...well, well supported. I wish it was easier to add mods to the game. While the base game is fun, more monsters/characters/backgrounds/weapons/etc could be super interesting. It could enable people to make fights where there is more developed map types, more enemy types, just more flavor or personal touches. It wouldn't ruin how fun the base game is. While some may shift, many just want to expand upon the same base grittiness.

The music is amazing. It really brings out the excitement, fears and tension that comes with mercenary life. The audio is similarly one-of-a-kind. Particularly memorable are the sounds that the characters make when they're in their death throes. It really brings to home how violent and cruel the battlefield is. I can still remember one of my strongest fighters gurgling as he choked on his own blood after an Orc slit his throat.

But what really takes the cake is the gameplay. It is uncompromising but not ludicrously difficult. You are punished for your mistakes and rewarded for your ingenuity. For example, I accidentally skipped a dying character's turn as I was frantic and panicking, and he went down without a fight - he could have survived had I gotten him to swing his pickaxe twice. The battle was near its end too :(

Anyway, yeah, if you want to play this game, don't expect an easy time. Don't be like me - I thought success here was merely all about forming a solid block of line with shields. I decided to turn my mercenary company into a row of legionaries - All my shield brothers had swords and javelins, with some supports at the back with bows, crossbows and pikes. I died to an Orcish charge, because their shields negated my javelins, and swords are weak against armor.

I have played this game since Early Access while looking for a tactics game. If you are a fan of those too, you may know that this subgenre is niche. When I found this game it was grand, to say the least and playing it for a while, for the first time, was a strange mix of going down a treat and being fed up constantly by the limited options you have, specially in the early game.

Its the kind of product you can sink a lot of hours into:
[list]
    [*]There are plenty of contracts to fulfill, each with its own difficulty.
    
    [*]The overworld is extense, so there is room for some exploration, dungeon clearing and some looting. (Be wary of the negative side of this too, though).
    
    [*]Managing your resources efficiently and learning the tricks of the trade will take you some time to learn.
    
    [*]Each kind of adversary has fortes and weaknesses; learning these in the long run becomes essential, to say the least.
    
    [*]Late game crisis added a new layer to the game. An endgame, essentially, so you must prepare apropriately.
    
    [*]Bosses and rare foes are challenging with unique mechanics, not just overpowered fodder thrown at you.
    
    [*]Numerous options for recruits, each with its own backstory and perks associated with its ""job"", along with some character flaws to balance things nicely.
    
    [*]Nice number of weapons and customization options for your band of murderous misfits. Each weapon has unique skills attached to them.
[/list]

Now, what are my gripes with this game?
[list]
     
[*]It becomes repetitive quite fast. A lot of the contracts will be annoyingly similar to one another. The fact that contracts can be far away from each other and there is barely anything to do during the journey doesn't help either.
     
[*]While the overworld is extense indeed, there are [b]huge[/b] gaps between one interesting point and another. Sometimes travelling between a town and another feels like a lifeless void of boredom.
     
[*][b]The game lacks depth.[/b] And this is the most glaring issue of all. Simply put, the M&B formula grows old quickly since it references off its shortcomings as well. You manage resources (read as 'stockpile') and bash some enemies' heads. Repeat the cycle infinitely until your mob is armed to the teeth and ready to challege even larger prey.

[*][b][u]F r u s t r a t i o n[/u][/b] This is a major drawback.

To elaborate:

Some of the enemy types are just pure bullsh!t, like necrosavants, who can teleport around the arena, targeting your/your allies' weakest points until all of your company lies defeated; unhold attacks that just seem to inflict a ton of injueries whenever they hit or throw your guys around or hexe charm spam. 

Really, while there are countermeasures for most these encounters, I find them to be quite limited (club stuns + nets, lol) and facing these foes is a major frustration instead of something enjoyable. Most of the time I find myself avoiding these fights overall instead of giving it a chance. Seems like some of the new enemies need balance, but gods forbid uttering such a word in the forums.

[*]Fatigue is a silly mechanic and could be handled better. It sure makes sense that a character wearing heavy armor will grow tired more quickly than another wearing light armor. However, being able to walk one tile and attacking once before becoming useless for the next few turns, until said character catches his breath, is just awful.

[*]This one is debatable: What is the point of spending large ammounts of gold for a, say, Hedge Knight character, when a farmer with a greatsword might be just as good? Better scaling for some statistics, alright... but is that enough to make the exchange agreeable? I think not.
[/list]

In a nutshell. The game isn't bad at all, it has its challenges alright but is in dire need of excitement; it wants for ups and downs besides losing the occasional peasant or miller to a dragon or goblins. It needs more options outside the box and surprises. Besides, some enemies are just downright terrible and unbalanced, the only way you have to deal with them is by cheesing fights using maces to stunlock and nets; not really that strategic when mostly every difficult encounter revolves around this, huh?

I think the team have been good fellows, attempting to push this game to a better path with each major update, but there is a slight disconnection between them and the community. I have hopes. Either from them or the newborn modding community.

For me the balance feels all over the place, some enemies are a fun and rewarding challenge while others feel completely over powered and pointless to fight. For the majority of my battles it seemed like it was just a big game of chance with a little strategy involved. When I say little strategy I mean that the AI is pretty dumb and easy to exploit. Just get some squishy troops and put them in seemingly vulnerable positions and the AI will almost always go for them, which allows you to easily pick them off as they trap themselves. This wouldn't necessarily be a downside but the game gets really stale when you know how easy it is to exploit the AI. 

This game will require that you spend a decent chunk of time learning the nuances and mechanics(some of which are incredibly frustrating at times) and even more time experimenting before you finally get a decent play through. And that's where the real challenge begins.

For me the most fun I had was during the transition from early to mid game when I was fighting enemies that were on equal footing with me and presented a fun and rewarding challenge. After that it seemed like the enemies weren't getting ""better"" just tankier and could hit harder, like the AI had less and less strategy as time went on because it didn't need it if it can just brute force its way through.

Many things that could easily be fixed with the tiniest of additions (IE Tutorial, information pop-up, **** just a tiny help icon in the corner that can give a brief description of something if you mouse over it, I understand you have your core player base but maybe explaining how certain mechanics in game operate instead of forcing users to find the information themselves would yield some benefit. I'm playing a game, not writing a thesis.

For a group of mercenaries, your characters suck off the bat. Like XCOM, accuracy rarely means anything and you just kind of Hail Mary hoping that your 22% bow shot will hit while the enemy re-enacts 300 on your troops. I hear late* game your accuracy goes up, cool, maybe not make it a nightmare to get to that point? The most effective strategy is to out gear the enemy. That's it. If you level, enemies scale. If you build up your forces, enemies scale. If you have the best equipment in the known universe, the enemies have sticks.

But the art actually grew on me quite a bit and I've been having a blast customizing my band and giving them silly names. The artwork itself is really quite fantastic. It captures a bleakness that suits it's low-fantasy Germanic medieval world. I really like it. What really grabs me is the tactical battles. I love tactics games, especially games like Final Fantasy Tactics, X-Com, and Heroes of Might and Magic. Battle Brothers isn't quite as technical as those first two games due to a lack of any sort of class system, but I really think that's what makes it stand out. After all, you're leading a rag-tag band of ruffians around a dirty, dank world; of course they're not going to be well-educated fighters with fancy titles. And it keeps with the low-fantasy theme, which I enjoy much more than high fantasy. The overland map is basically a hub of towns where you can get quests and jobs, re-supply, and also recruit new men for your band. You'll see many reviewers who have hundreds of hours of play time on this game, and once you start playing, it's easy to see why. Battle Brothers is breezy good fun with a deep tactical battle system, great and fun customization options (every item and outfit changes the look of your characters busts), and a thoughtful overland map system.

[h1]Quick Summary [/h1]

Overall the game starts out with great progression of power, starting out like peasants if you choose that route, to try and become decent, you won’t become overpowered unless it was after when I quit. As a die-hard medieval theme fan, it offers some fun, but quickly became boring with the same repeated quests, with more interesting ones too spread out. The combat and skills never felt like a real game changer until too late in the game when I got bored so. Shorten the playtime, especially as they want the game to be replayed a lot, it doesn’t earn that rite with such bloated campaigns. If you really want a medieval game, just get Kingdom Come instead, it’s so much better and will scratch that itch minus the creating a company part.

[u]More in depth: [/u]
[list]
    [*]If you know me, I love anything medieval, I love to watch and play anything in this time period. I don’t know why, it’s the same with zombies, so having both in this game was a treat. There are moments of fun, but it’s too far apart and bloated with MMO style grind to make me enjoy the game. 

    [*] The game doesn’t have a scripted campaign, it’s all procedural and for me that hurts it tremendously. You get so many repeated quests, it’s insane, half of my mission were just take a package with you or guard people that deliver said package. I can look past very limited quests early on, it’s all I can afford, I don’t  have weapons or armor to do anything exciting. You do get some cool ones here and there, one tied to a DLC. So it varies a little, needs way more and the wiki shows the later on the more it opens up.

    [*] But I never made it to the later part of the. I put 20 hours and I think I made it to the “endgame”. Here you can choose or be random, a major crisis to happen, zombie apocalypse, orc invasion, or noble war. I chose random and got the least interesting one. After a certain point, orcs come and can permanently destroy villages, (if you set that option). Interesting so far, but all your missions are kill orcs and they are not easy and not fun and got boring quickly, doing only orc missions. 

    [*]One thing that I love in this game is formations and weapon type matters a lot. As each has a role with each having different attacks that do a wide range of effects and damage. Ranged kind of sucks. I rarely see any meaningful use other than crossbows. Long reach weapons can attack 2 tiles away, so you get formations set up with all these weapons and do some sweet combats. Shields and spears is SOOO COOL. You put up your shield and do spear wall and enemies will get poked and almost always never break it. Having this setup can block your enemies and set up kill boxes and prevent them from pushing and damaging you. You can’t do it forever and the dreaded orcs instantly bash through it. The only real counter to orcs is throwing fishing nets on them, they have to waste energy to get rid of it to move and rid the penalties of the net. This was cool to learn, and mad the orc fights not an instant lose. 

    [*]The enemy variety is real good, with each taking different weapons/gadgets or movements to overcome. Zombies come back, spiders poison and immobilize, witches charm, humans die, and orc berserkers can instakill anyone. Another reason I hate orcs, they always charge stun on first engagement, which is hard to prevent even with spear walls. So getting only mission with these wore me down and made me enjoy the game less. Why can they one shot a guy with heavy armor? No other enemy up to this was so annoying. 

    [*]One way for me to try and give me a fair advantage is each load of the start of combat you get a random level, so you can redo this till you get one that gives high ground. Don’t give us that option, I’ll abuse it, especially when you can go the whole 30 minute fight and be fine than lose a guy you can’t afford to lose. I had a similar issue with Darkest Dungeon, I hate that about these games, it’s a waste of my time.

I didn't really take this game seriously for a few years because it doesn't have the best graphics and looked a little too low budget for me, but I gave it a shot and am really impressed. If you like tactical games like XCOM you'll probably like this.

Pros
1) It's deceivingly simple at first and you can get started running pretty quick but there's so much to learn about the game's mechanics and enemies and the different strategies that work against them. The mechanics are also easily available via the wiki.
2) Addicting - you always want to do one more contract or one more fight. Generally speaking it's really well balanced for the first few hundred days and you 'make do' with what you get. If you want to play the late game it gets more boring and grindy, but there are fun end-game camps and scenarios that you can look forward to.
3) A nice balance of tactical combat and strategic thinking - the expansions really polish the game and I highly recommend them.
4) RNG can be frustrating on both the tactical and strategic layer but it keeps things fresh and interesting (for the most part!), plus you can always save before you take a risky contract or fight.
5) Great community - the wiki is really well done and contributed to and the modding community is on point. There aren't too many streamers beyond FilthyRobot but he's still active and has a lot of helpful content so be sure to check him out.
6) Nice soundtrack, but some of the tracks get dull after a while. Fortunately there's a music mod you can get at NexusMods. 

Cons 
1) The game can get very tedious without mods that offer quality of life improvements and ways to speed up the game. Many features you come to expect from modding should be in the base game, at least as options.
2) Speaking of mods, it's not an easy game to mod. There's no steam workshop so you have to rely on NexusMods and every time the game updates many of the mods break. So far my campaign / save files haven't broke yet, but sometimes really cool mods just stop working and unless the modder updates it you're out of luck.
3) The game's topography view is abysmal - you can easily screw up positioning because you misinterpret the lay of the land. 
4) Losing star mercenaries is pretty much unacceptable after a point if you're going for the late game grind so almost every battle must be won without losing anyone otherwise you're looking at a very long time to replace him, if you find someone as good as him again that is...
5) It's very hard to find top tier mercenaries with the right attribute spread and focus.

10,55495251,english,"Fun at first with cool audio, art style and visuals, then you realize your mercenaries (some of whom were apparently veteran soldiers) don't get any better. Undead enemies have enough alacrity to dodge an overhead slash from your most experienced fighter while the most expensive archer from the town that you hired can't shoot anything at point blank distance, I am not exaggerating. Gives the illusion that you're progressing as the game goes on by giving you more money and getting more items but you'll still be using basic equipment because for some reason fatigue increases the more equipped your troops are. So what ends up happening is you're cycling through cities and hiring any cheap peasants and gearing them with shields swords and bows and watching them die since you sure as fuck are not keeping a high leveled character for more than 10 battles before a goblin lands a sick headshot on them or invulnerable ghosts (LMAO) kill them, and even if you do they'll end up getting permanent disabilities like brain damage which reduces their performance by A LOT.

Long sheet: There are not so many good games about mercenaries. Especially - about running the mercs team. Yeah, there were some mediocre projects, such as GTA-like ""Mercenaries"" from Pandemic Studios... But seriously, if we are talking about deep-in-details mercs life simulator, it's either real-time 3d-fights of [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/48700/Mount__Blade_Warband/]Mount&Blade[/url], or turn-based planning of the tactical [url=http://store.steampowered.com/bundle/2850/Jagged_Alliance_2_Platinum/]Jagged Alliance[/url] (and all its followers, such as [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/289890/762_High_Calibre/]""7.62""[/url] from Apeiron).

And, since the ""Battle Brothers"" is the turn-based, let's talk about such games a bit, ok? There were never quite enough of such games... until the mobile age came, with its specific terms of gameplay. To put it all shortly, mobile tactical turn-based games are mostly way-too-easy, generic in story and gameplay, and the only point they can be anyhow tolerable is about graphics (Unity is awesome, have no doubt about it). But then again, I can understand such games on the mobiles, maybe on the consoles, but here on the PC-station, where we have glorious Jagged Alliance 2, to put other tactical games in comparison... it's all kinda dull and gloomy. Still, I don't want to say that JA2 was the one and only game you should play for ages. It is not the flawless gem on its own, and it is quite dated at the moment. 

And the battling spirit always eager for the new blood, right? So here they are, Blood Brothers, some story of the little band of condottiers (medieval soldiers of fortune), which is seeking profit and glory for the work of protection and killing... And you can rob the caravans and make yourself the wanted man if you want to! Not that I'd recommended that path, mind it, but it's a quick start. The dark path is so sweet, as it can only be, at the beginning of the road...

You'll start from the 3 sworn-brothers, and then can hire more, up to 20 in total. However, only 12 will be in the field at the moment, so the other 8 are benched. And that is quite reasonable, as you'll definitely need some spares. The battle system is tough! Once you've clinched the enemy in close combat, you can't simply jump away from it, for example. You can't get the best armor and weapon in the game, give it to the newb, and lead the battle... He'll be too weak even for a simple walk around, let alone axe swinging. So, this game is about slow and circumspect development of each of your recruits, and the whole squad and its combat tactics in general. The development which can be crushed into smithers in just one particularly unsuccessful fight. This is the game of the many restarts. In time, you'll be noticing which fellas, which backgrounds and traits are better for the long run. You'll learn to remember the world seeds numbers, as they are quite random, Civilization-like level. It could be quite frustrating and disastrous to live as a cheap merc in the Waterworld, where every boatman earns more than you...

Oh, well, I can talk more and more, but it would be better if you'll just try it. Out of the many latest good additions to the turn-based tactical games, Battle Brothers I'll mark No.1 by its complexity. Its semi-cartooned visual style, with annoying at first bobble-heads, which are so fragile against good cleave with the poleaxe or claymore... its really easy to come by, really. Especially when you'll see all the scars that the game can reflect on its characters... So much of realism as the one can get. But the other main problem, typical for turn-based games, Random-Almighty, can spurn some players easily. Especially the players who play Firaxis XCom and so proud for their invincible team... Boy, will the Battle Brothers beat that flatulence out of you! Nobody is immortal! Just like the faces of the characters reflect all the damage they take, so does the game with the typical fate of condottiere bands during all those endless medieval scuffles. 

So, I'll mark Battle Brothers with 9 deaths out of 10. You need at least one survivor to rebuild, you know... Be the survivor! Learn the depths of tactics with that game, learn the price of life and what's beyond. And after that, try some other turn-based game, to see the difference! That is why I'm so generous with exclamation marks there. The game is not perfect, but damn I'll be if it's not superior to 90% of other wannabes!",1521638442,1570271392,True,52,4,0.778260886669158936,0,True,False,False,76561198112810429,2010,440,9242,0,4102,1571100654,,

There are so many ways to create brothers, build them, and play the game.

Bravado means deaths! (Unless you're very very lucky)
Try to find a consistent and profitable trade routes in the beginning and accept skull one quests
Sometimes you got it easy with skull two quests tho..


All in all,
I rage quit most of the times but then play back again.

27,52570891,english,"Battle Brothers is by far the best turn based strategy games with a medieval settings out there. It has many similarities to the XCOM series, like individualisation of your troops and teambuilding in general, as well as permadeath. Your mercenary band has an open world to explore and many settlements to interact with, which also gives you the option to do a bit of trading. All in all it feels like a turn based version of Mount and Blade. As with all games there are some downsides to it, but for me the pros definitely outweigh the cons.

Pros:
- Open World
- Complex fighting system
- Complete character customization
- Many different skills for character builds
- Permadeath
- Different starting scenarios
- Atmospheric low fantasy setting
- Lots of different enemies
- Randomly generated world map, characters, etc.
- Many weapons and equipment with different effects
- Cool art design
- Three challenging endgame crises
- The satisfying feeling of chopping some bandit's head off

Cons:
- Entirely textbased 
- RNG can be decisive
- No real storyline
- No Tutorial
- Quite difficult for new players

I believe there are some serious balancing issues within the game (i.e. getting ambushed on iron man 3 days in by several raiders equipped with mid-game gear) that will make you scream.  But overall, a very strong contender for best strategy game of the year.  I can highly recommend to those who have a lot of time on their hands and wouldn't mind losing 40+ hour iron man game due to some randomness or unfairly ambushed by much better equipped crew.  

Pros:

Beautiful but simple graphic style
Innovative, fun combat system
Just enough loot/equipment mechanics (just 2 main armor pieces, not 35 like in Diablo)
Refreshing merc-simulator with nice in-game economy

Cons:

Extremely difficult unless you spam save constantly
Bad luck can RUIN an entire iron man campaign (you can seriously lose 100+ day campaign with 1 bad dialogue choice)
Balancing issues (by day 3 you're fighting with sharpened sticks and cloth armor, yet you may get ambushed by raiders with mid to late-game equipment, even on ""easy"" difficulty)
Hit %s seem off (I've read explanations of confirmation bias, have not done in depth study on %s, however, it seems very common to miss 3-4x in a row with 60-70%+ hit% showing, all the while getting hammered by the enemy)

Pros
+ Very good artwork and a graphic style that works
+ Plenty of scope for those who like to roleplay OR those who power game
+ Soundtrack is very good (although only a handful of tracks)
+ Mods are available on Nexus and are easy to install 
+ Lots to do and each run feels different thanks to random seed generation
+ Unlike a lot of games with events they dont really get stale. This is down to them appearing only sometimes rather than ever 5 mins
+ A good amount of foes with a large pool of equipment 
+ DLC material adds lots to the game, if you enjoy the base game the DLC only adds to the enjoyment
+ Runs smoothly with few bugs

Cons
- The game is hard to learn (not always a con) and is a little unforgiving. Not a game for those who dislike RNG/ do not know how to manage it. You will need a guide to work your way through how some things work as they arent really explained.
- Without DLC you only have 2 options for company starts, which can get a little stale. DLC fixes this!

41,54950381,english,"[i]Battle Brothers[/i] is bloody, merciless, and absolutely fantastic. You manage a company of mercenaries, each with their own individual quirks and traits, and guide them through a harsh “grimdark” fantasy world, all while trying to keep them fed, happy, and paid. In order to do so, your company travels from town to town in search of contracts. These may involve protecting a caravan from brigands, raiding a haunted crypt, or hunting down monsters terrorizing a town, to name a few.

The game is brutal and unforgiving; as you play, brothers will die, and contracts will go unfulfilled. However, with great risk comes great reward, and the promise of riches and loot will drive the search for ever greater challenges and foes. Engaging a powerful enemy is both thrilling and terrifying: you may lose some men, but you may also loot some amazing gear. This give-and-take discourages save-scumming when your brothers die, since that shiny new helmet is probably worth more than a single man's life, and who knows if it will drop again when you reload. 

Sometimes a heroic sacrifice makes for a better story anyway.

Of course, combat is where [i]Battle Brothers[/i] truly shines. Frontlines clash and attempt flanking maneuvers, while backline troops barrage enemies with arrows and polearms. Every weapon has its strengths and weaknesses: axes are great for taking out shields, for example, while maces can stun an enemy with a strike to the head. Morale severely impacts combat performance, and is paramount to success; when characters die or flee, their allies may waver and break. Use this to your advantage. Terrain also plays an important role in every fight, and careful positioning is key to overcoming greater odds. Battle maps are randomly generated, so no two fights play out the same.

The game's presentation is wonderful. The paper doll system, along with the wide array of weapons and armour, means that each character looks unique. This gives them personality, and makes it hard not to bond with your unruly band of sellswords. Injuries are also represented in gritty fashion, and a battered and bloody company will look the part. 

The world map is randomly generated, but still manages to feel organic and painterly; and it comes to life as caravans and soldiers roam the countryside, and boats sail from port to port. The UI is also incorporated into the theme with wooden panels and decorations, so it feels natural and doesn’t clash with the setting.

Sound design is top notch: cries of pain and crunching armour will make you cringe every time a brother takes a nasty hit, while the jingle of coins will come to elicit a pavlovian response. The music is superb, and changes depending on the context and the enemies you are facing. The ominous music while fighting the undead is enough to put you on edge (especially at night), while the jubilant track after a successful battle is always cathartic (as if to sing, “I’m a survivor, I’m gonna make it...”)

Many have criticized the game for its RNG, and while it can be frustrating, the effects can always be mitigated with smart decisions: taking the right contracts, carefully building your company, and retreating when you know an enemy is too powerful. Of course, once in a while a foe will get a lucky hit, or a brother will miss a target he shouldn’t have. [b]That’s [i]Battle Brothers[/i], baby![/b] Part of the challenge is being prepared to deal with those situations when they occur.

[i]And they will.[/i]

[i]Battle Brothers[/i] is a challenging, yet rewarding tactical experience. You will lose, but losing is fun, and each loss is a lesson and a story. The developers are amazing, and they have already released multiple, substantial DLCs that you should definitely check out if you enjoy the base game.

56,54757781,english,"Good game but RNG factor can be very, very annoying and stressful.

Personally I feel like RNG factor in this game is a bit TOO absurd and at times it is just too much. 

Examples of RNG being really bad in this game:
Somehow, my level 11 archers with 80% chance to hit misses 4 rounds in a row while they are point blank range while enemy archers who probably has 8% due to range and bodies between, lands a perfect headshots after headshots. 
Or, you fight a tough fight against  21 hostile house's troops and beat them, and while enjoying your loot after the battle for 5 sec, your caravan gets attacked by another 19 enemy soldiers without option to retreat and watch your men get slaughtered even though they survived 90 days like a bad ass fighting crazy monsters after monsters. 
Or, your level 11 badass with over 12k crown worth equipment and amazing armor dies in one shot by some random goon with a crossbow. Yes it is realistic, but it happens WAY TOO OFTEN. I really don't recommend getting this game if you just want to have fun. 

But still, fun to play but can be very frustrating due to RNG.

57,53416784,english,"Is it hard? Yep. Is it a good game? With the expansions, it's bordering on masterpiece.

You'll grow to love the team you build. Dudes will die. Your favorite dudes will die. From the reviews, it might look like the best course of action when that happens is to get on steam and write a negative review, but there's more to do.

You'll try combos, you'll try to get cute, sometimes it will work and it's great. Other times, a dude will die, which will cause another dude to run, he'll die, and by the time a single battle is over you lost 7 of your 12 guys. That feels bad, and it's probably time to restart. The game will scale with you, but you can outpace it and in a long campaign it seems to have a cap. There will always be easy fights out there if you look for them. If you win enough of those, you'll eventually beat your first catastrophe and the game will make a bit more sense. Then, if you're still enjoying yourself, you can think about taking on the crazy hard end game content that's definitely out there.

Here's some tips: You will lose bros, especially early on. Minimize losses and keep a few replacements ready. Don't take every fight. Unless you're playing with permanent destruction off, which ended up being my preference, your company of fighters isn't going to get invincible, not even right up to the end of the first catastrophe (besides maybe a couple of your tanks, and it's still a relative term). Pay attention when hostile stuff comes into your screen. If you haven't seen it before and you're deep in the game, save yourself a headache and google it. Pause the game and think about if you can actually fight it. Also, if you can safely fight it, you probably should. You need the money, XP, and equipment. Don't take every contract. First of all, make sure you're going to actually make money. Second, if the thing you're supposed to fight is going to kill you, renege on the contract. Just cancel it.

Battle Brothers is a game about running a mercenary company. You get to fight battles on a small map with characters recruited from towns. Your party moves on a large world map. Your characters level up and gain skills and traits as you defeat enemies, you also can eventually equip them with more powerful gear. Money is gained by looting, trading, or completing contracts from towns. Good concept, game is not meant for casual players or people who can't devote endless hours and learn every strategy and gimmick for every situation, that's fine but buyer beware.

Decided to buy some DLC and try again. New starting scenarios looked cool, I opted to start as a group of poachers... 5 times. 

First try, started on a golbin encampment, got destroyed. Oh well bad luck, I'm sure ill get another eagle eyed hunter.

Second try, get a contract, its undead, arrows do nothing, i fail to retreat soon enough, still getting used to the game again my bad. 

Third try, terrible looking map and bad traits, retire. 

Fourth try, get a contract, kill 4 Nachzehrers out of 5, miss every attack, moves to a corpse, miss every attack, regens and kills a guy, miss every attack, kills another guy, rage quit. 

Fifth attempt, looks like decent map and ok brother traits, get a contract for Nach's again, recruit more brothers and bought basic equipment, kill all but one, miss every attack, it eat regens, hit on some attacks, get it down to 1 hit point, it one shots my last melee guy, archers are out of ammo, forgot about that, oops no melee weapon backups to switch to, rage quit.

-------------------

I have come to the conclusion that in this game you are simply gambling with your time and fun. This game entirely revolves around RNG and scaling in order to make the game 'fun' and 'challenging'. You are at the mercy of a terrible percentage based, scaled combat system that features permadeath. At any moment the RNG can string together a series of bad rolls that will destroy your company regardless of any action you have taken. It doesn't matter how well you have planned or executed your strategy or even how strong your guys are - the RNG will dictate success. 

The intense 'fun' some people experience in this game is because of the gambling mechanic, especially on Ironman. Basically, there will be many, many times when the fate of your company depends on the next one or two attack rolls. This is where the game gambles with your fun and time and gets peoples blood pumping. Will you keep having fun with a surviving company or will your fun end due to brothers dying? It will depend on the roll of the dice. Will the last half an hour of your time be worth it or will it be wasted? It will depend on the roll of the dice. 

There are times when the game is heaps of fun, but that is only when the RNG has gone in your favour. No doubt people who enjoy gambling IRL would love this game.",1561827731,1566006061,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197971389142,450,147,2136,0,1112,1563391428,,

79,54575654,english,"An addictive love child of X-Com and Mount & Blade, if you like either of those games you'll most likely enjoy Battle Brothers. Game has a  fairly well done random world generator which reacts to what you do and what others do, if a local region is terrorized by a bunch of spiders and you don't do jack, that region will keep suffering and the problem will just keep getting bigger, if you fail or half fail a quest, it can result in people getting unhappy with you and a new quest popping up where you gotta fix the damage your failure caused, this makes you feel like you're actually part of the world and it rather immerses you into it deeply as everything has consequences.

The combat of the game  is turn based and filled up the bum with RNG dice rolling, that will make you sweat,curse,cheer,tense up and rage as somehow your whole squad of mercs keeps somehow failing hits that have 80+% chances to hit while enemy arches rain down hell upon you, never missing a single shot, it is truly a wonderful experience [not really]. It's probably only major deal breaker for some people, even if you prep properly, have items equipped specially for said situation you're in such as getting some good blunt weapons to deal with some plate lads you're about to face, it can still end up going extremely poorly by either getting a really bad randomly generate map to fight on, such as spawning in crotch level high swamp water while all of the enemy is on dry land or by simply having the game give you a middle finger as every swing ends up missing an opponent from multiple mercs in your company while your highly geared soldiers get beaten up by  wooden sticks and mallets. I know i make it sound bad and well kinda it is, but anyone coming from X-Com knows well that's just life in a game like this. On the flip side when things go right, when Christ himself blesses your dice roll and you decapitate two or three guys in one swing and cause mass panic to ensure in the enemy ranks then you'll have a dumb satisfied grin on your face and think ""Yeah, that was totally ""skill"" "".

Presentation is outstanding, music,world,enemy design , all of it looks and sounds great. Battlefields get bloodied, covered in broken shields and armor with heads flying off and painting the ground in crimson. While when exploring the big world you hear a variety of well done ambient sounds, the creepy spooky ambient ones being my favorite as you travel while hopping to Christ you don't bump into a necromancer with fallen heroes in the middle of the woods.

You can customize your difficulty setting, can make the enconomy easier so you get more money and pay less but then if you wish you can make fights more difficult by ramping up the enemy count, so even though the game is difficult it offers a good diversity of customization on how difficult you want it to be with the option of also playing Ironman if you're masochistic enough. Iv'e only played Veteran [Normal] so far but honestly I'd say pick Beginner for starters, i sure wish i did that's for sure.

There's also two DLCs for the game, the most recent one is themed around Nordic Barbarians and is the best one to get as it adds 10 new starting stories for your playthroughs, so instead of just being a mercenary company you can also be for an example a cultist group that has to sacrifice people to get gifts from the gods but even if you just buy the base game it self you already get plenty of content as it is honestly but I'd still strongly recommend the north DLC if you end up enjoying the game.

Iv'e only gotten a little time with it so far but still wanted to recommend it since it's a fun game even with the rather bad RNG that always favors your enemy, just avoid playing on Ironman and honestly freely save before every fight because the dice is almost never on your side so use the tools at your disposal to enjoy the game more.",1565571958,1565892427,True,6,0,0.534555733203887939,0,True,False,False,76561197998133593,562,161,3300,0,936,1598348673,,

You play as a wayward mercenary company in the middle of a dark-fantasy turning of age, where some great event looms on the horizon and you?  You are simply caught in the middle of it, trying to survive and profit to boot.  You will find days where you are so poor you can't afford bread, and others where you're so rich you're considering buying a legendary item at market price from a smith.   

Now?  With all these latest dlcs?  This game is even bigger.  And even better.  Furthermore, these devs are saints.  They said they would stop developing this game -years- ago, and the fans convinced them to keep going instead.  These dlcs are content rich and really -expand- the game rather than just being single-off additions you'll find in much more expensive games. 

And let me just say, the variety of the weapons in this game are great.  The combat is great.  Somehow it doesn't get repetitive despite it being the same simple system over and over and over again- your evolving brothers and the evolving, darkening horizon of enemies and events keep almost every fight full of either fearful hope, optimism, or proud confidence.  This thing is wonderful.

I very rarely review games, but just... I can't play this thing for over 1k hours over all these years without trying to voice my support for this sheer gemstone of a game for dark fantasy lovers.   If you seem to like the premise, buy it.  It's worth the coin.

But you can't lose any battles. If you lose a battle, you might as well start over. Even on the easiest setting, money is scarce, so I never have a whole lot in the bank.

When I do sound the retreat, every enemy gets a free attack against my fleeing troops and they move fast enough to keep up. So that's four or five free attacks on every one of my guys depending on how far from the edge of the map they are. 

So everyone dies. Or near enough to everyone that it makes no difference. I have one or two wounded stragglers, no equipment and no money to rebuild.

No matter what you do, your armor, soldier skill, tactics, at certain points the game will create situations where you just cant win, or win without losses. Somehow your crossbow men misses 5 shots with 70% chance, and enemy will kill him through shieldwall.
RNG is RNG I know, but after 10+ battle restarts same exact thing happens over and over. Enemy archers and crossbowmen in first turn ALWAYS make critical hits and My soldiers ALWAYS miss their 50-70% shots in the first few rounds. Like if the game has some hidden mechanics that silently adjusts rng to suit its needs.

I've been following the game almost from its conception, and I've been ever since in love with it, it's incredible how simple of a concept it is, but how complex it can be when done originally.
My problem is this; The dlcs should NOT be almost half the price of the game, no matter how much they're adding to the game itself, and believe me from what I've seen, they do, but improving the game to its final potential little by little to make the most money out of it is not good, you will end up creating a colossus imposible to defeat if a sequel is on the horizon, thus destroying an entertaining game.
This ended up dissapointing me, maybe because I can't play the vanilla game without feeling stupid for not being able to enjoy what everyone else is enjoying, or maybe because the guys who I supported from the beggining (and the reason why I put the little money I have on buying the game, instead of easily pirating it) made me feel sort of betrayed when they did what every big company does, instead of putting out a complete game, they make a complete game on the run, taking more and more money out of the people interested in the game.

At any moment the RNG can string together a series of bad rolls that will destroy your company regardless of any action you have taken.

The intense 'fun' some people experience in this game is because of the gambling mechanic, especially on Ironman.

This is where the game gambles with your fun and time and gets peoples blood pumping. Will you keep having fun with a surviving company or will your fun end due to brothers dying?

You take sides (with the houses - orcs & undead are not to be negotiated! :-P ), strengthen your group and try to survive.

Stupid things like One soldier fully surrounded but still able to get  a free attack  if any of the guys surrounding him try to move. You archer being completely useless until they reach a very high level but the CPU archer can destroy your guys from the other side of the screen. Yes the CPU isn't bound by the rule of the game. The game is full of idiocies.

The controls, so to speak, are awful. It is very easy to mis-click something like passing a character turn and the game lack all the necessary ease of life feature you would expect in a game like that like good inventory management.

Simple visuals are acceptable for an indie game but here it limits the information you get from the game and often it is hard to get what  has happened. It is also very unappealing.

Beware of the computer combat order. Tracked the results of 19 different battles. In each battle the computer began felling brothers with rounds 5 and 6. Round 6 saw an increase of 65% for multiple brothers falling in battle as compared to previous or post 6 rounds.
Also, can not figure as to why the ""percent to hit"" value is included.... you are as likely to hit with 33% as 85%. 
Combat algorithms seem, to me, to be skewed. In one battle my brothers all had better than 75% chance to hit a target and missed 11 times before landing the first blow...

31,54045223,english,"Fun but surprisingly shallow in almost every aspect.

At its core, it's a turn based game of tactics. You run a band of mercenaries and take on jobs, most of which require one battle to resolve. As you gain more fame, you get harder and higher paying jobs.

It's very addictive. But at the same time, it's not that satisfying.  For instance, the turn based battles don't have a lot of strategy involved. There's some, but basically it comes down to having the right build for your guys. And better equipment. Not strategy. But grinding.  

The graphics are weird, somewhat like the Super Deformed you used to see in the SNES era in Japan. But the graphics illustrate a problem with the tactical aspect of the game. There's no facing. There's terrain, but it's difficult to use because of the awkward view. And almost every battle starts with you almost on top of the enemy (or vice versa),

There's really no endgame, just more of the same. You might create an impressive fighting force, but ultimately, you'll never be a ruler anywhere.

You can to give them titles which helps tell them apart.
Graphics - superb, and with several colour / face / armour combinations that you can decorate the men with. This is helpful to tell them apart in battle.
Stay too long in one area you eat up all the food - so travel wide.
Some towns have barbers (to give your guys new faces, etc), temples (to heal), ports (for long range travel), kennels (for woofers to set on your enemy), weaponsmiths, armourers, markets, and the vital tavern.  
Every penny counts, at least at the start. Later on every trip to a town means fun at the tavern!
Easy jobs to start with, but low pay.   Tougher jobs (contracts) later, along with lashing of cash, at which point you can jazz up your fave people.
Double speed button for long journeys.
New game, new map.
Do not fight wolves with your bare hands.

-
Frustrating at start.
Impossible - no chance to win, too hard, not enough money, until you realise what to do! So not suitable for low attention span crybaby types.
Is it even safe to eat the dodgy meat you find in  goblin camps?

Starter Hints -  build up 6, 8, 10 men but slowly. Avoid attacking  places like cemeteries until much later. Low level jobs as caravan guards (one dot) might be taken until you build up.  Level 2 and 3 jobs should be avoided. Maybe stick to a few weapon combos and tactics until later, such as spear and shield (shield wall / spear wall tactics).  Sell all the specialist weapons at the market for simplicity, you can try the fancy stuff later. For early games do easy and save before big battles - so you can retry out different tactics when you get creamed by wolves, goblins, sneaky bandidos and so on.

Stupidly hard even on beginner. Ruins the fun when you get destroyed right from the start.

Developers need to see that not everyone wants to do the same battle 50 times,   Tone it down like 1000%.

The hardest thing is figuring out where there is a  tree on the map or where you can move to or where you can get a shot.  In sum- the battle maps are absolutely TERRIBLE. You could  add a basic hex grid with some colours (brown is a road, green is a tree) and it would be more playable.    There are so many games like this and they all manage to do maps much better.      Multiple layers with horrible view, and no ability to rotate the maps for a point of view.  t

Has some potential,but I think the developers have been lazy and not thought it through very well.

I've played enough strat games and FF11 and FF14 to know a good grind but farking hell! If you have one life and wish to play one game, this is it! Kiss your free time goodbye because you will marry this game if you are even 'slightly' OCD. 
I like the game, but devs... you really need a complete overhaul on end game content. Don't nobody have that time!

21,53495116,english,"Battle Brothers is a interesting game, but has a pretty annoying gimmick that can be game breaking for most.


Features-

-Low level fantasy turn based rpg, where you run a mercenary company that goes around earning fame and money.
-Its pretty balanced in terms of playability. As far as RPG goes.  Trade is usable and recommended, but the game goes pretty far to prevent cheesing it through trade.
-The battles are in a arena with hexagons instead of squares.

Pros-
-  Except for one thing that the game does, its pretty balanced in its rpg gameplay.  The replayability is really good IMO.
-I like the fantasy stuff, its practical in a sense that it isn't stupid.

Cons-
- The games big gimmick is that its difficult.  It is challenging yes, but you won't be losing to anything except artificial gameplay.
-  You attack based on % chance.  Which is fine, but it becomes obvious when the AI decides to hit to you inflate the challenge of the game.  
-  Also the game curve is ridicules.  The game scales with you and your company.  If you add 1 more guy, watch out the enemy now has 2 more guys.  It has to keep its advantage over you at all times.


Final Point:  It is difficult when you're missing 80% chances 5 times in a row.  Its hard when the enemy actually has a 50-30% hit rate when you can barely handle killing someone you have 5 guys around.  It is a challenge when you are capped at 12 guys (as far as I know) and they have pretty big numbers of units.  Its not fun when its luck based and not strategy based.  I understand it wouldn't be a ""hard"" game if you didn't have frivolous bullshit balancing mechanics.  Its just not fun.

Conclusion:  Get it on sale.  It will be frustrating many times, but you will get lucky and be able to experience the game eventually.",1562235690,1562235690,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,76561197975197906,317,3,17501,506,1440,1601247482,,

The replay-ability of this game is absurd, with the new added beginnings for you and your brothers, anything can happen.

The complexity of the game shines through with the fact that pretty much everything plays into your chance for success. This ranges from sustaining injuries, variations in the landscape, line of sight, weapon type, enemy type, resolve of your brothers, their individual skill, their perks, and more. If you like to pay attention, or play chess, this game really scratches that itch. I'm a huge fan of the 1.3 mod for Final Fantasy Tactics, in terms of difficulty being introduced into a strategy based game, and where when you mess up you are actually punished.

The idea is quite simple: you lead a band of mercenaries that may include from professional fighters to vagabonds, landless peasants, petty criminals and all kind of individuals in your quest for fame and gold. Then, you move around the map looking for contracts, equipment, supplies, reinforcementes and places to explore and plunder.

But is the execution what makes the game awsome.

In the first place, this is not an easy game. The tactic aspect of the battles is vital, and not even the best gear can help you with some of the encounters you may face. You will die and loose your men often, and you will load same save game several times in a battle because a wrong decision or step will lead to disaster. The AI is not that dumb and, although the RNG factor may make you rage quit sometimes, if you act intelligently, with tactics and a good strategy (your men initial positioning, or even the weapons you choose for them to start with are determinant), you will able to win most fights. 

Knowing what battles to avoid is a must too, that's something you learn quick after several painful defeats. You must build your mercenary band hunting bandits and easy preys at the beginning, and move onto harder enemies once your band is bigger and better.

All you mercenaries have their stats and skills too, which makes it very interesting as you have quite a lot of freedom to try different builds. They also need to get paid, what forces you to continuosly be on the move to get gold for their wages, and get hurt and even maimed somehow. Therefore, better do not get too attached to your men, they will either die in battle or be fired by you if become useless. 

Finally, this game has lots of replayability. You usually start with differents mercs and a different map and, aside of the initial ""tutorial"" mission, every game is different. I sometimes find myself ""starting"" a new game several times until I get a nice start.

33,52919811,english,"This game takes the Mount & Blade formula, loses some of the depth of the world and its characters, but then adds fantasy flavor, deep unit management, and an extremely addictive and challenging turn-based tactics-style combat system.

The first thing I noticed was the care that's gone into every single aspect of this game. The world is lovingly crafted and the random events while playing are rich and occur often, sometimes even providing a bit of narrative story about your men or your journey that serves no purpose other than to immerse you in the world. Each character has a bit of backstory but will express more personality as they grow and develop through your game. You will definitely get attached to every single one of your men, which makes the inevitable purpose of the game, the combat, all the more intense.

The customization and leveling of your men is good, and reflects certain specialties and a depth to the combat system that will take many hours of playing to grasp. There is a lot of RNG in the combat, but like any similar system, the idea is to plan around this randomness and mitigate as much as you can. It can be punishing and brutal when you start, as it should be, but this will motivate most people to continue pressing on, learning, and overcoming the odds to snatch a hard-fought victory in the end.

One of my only cons is related to this, as sometimes the randomness of what happens to you will be so frustrating that you WILL reload a previous save. Save scumming seems to be a common trend in this game, so be prepared for that, and how long it takes to level up your men (combined with how attached to them you will get) adds to this. Losing even a single man hurts, but if something goes south and one of your experienced veterans takes an axe to the face or arrow to the neck, it's a serious blow.

The battlefields are also quite randomized, sometimes giving you a massive starting advantage and other times completely screwing you over by putting you in a ditch with the enemy on the top of a huge hill in front of you.

Save scumming and the difficulty and RNG aside, this game has become one of my all-time favorites after only playing it for a short while. It's so satisfying in so many ways, and each challenge you face and victory you pull off will feel like you've really earned it. I HIGHLY recommend this gem to anyone that loves any of these types of games, either the Mount & Blade style warband leadership or the FF-tactics-style turn-based hex combat, this game is an instant classic in both genres.",1561999532,1561999532,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198088630363,124,10,2884,0,1376,1584082920,,

48,52862038,english,"Gernot, a seasoned spearman who cut his teeth in the city guard, sat down at the campfire with me. He spoke of ill feelings about the coming conflict. Our company was short a few men. Those who still stood were ill-prepared to fight the well-armed brigands camped just beyond the ridge. Nonetheless, Gernot knew that the morning would bring with it the sounds of battle. The taste of blood. Lothar, well into a bottle (he was always well into a bottle), brushed off Gernot's concerns and boasted how many heads his axe would take on the morrow. His eyes spoke the truth his tongue tried to hide.

When our swords met theirs in the early morning sun, Gernot was where he always was; the front line. His spear wall held strong with our fresh recruits by his side. They were frightened farmhands and dock workers who held their swords in front of them like torches in the dark. The brigands knew they'd be easy prey. As they marched toward our line with weapons trained on our green recruits, Gernot held. He always held. An enemy fell to his spear. Two. A third was wounded and wavering. Lothar, the mad axeman closed from the flank and finished the work. As victory loomed and our losses were light, a nameless thug with a lucky swing cut Gernot down. There was no great spectacle. Just a man's throat cut by cold steel. Lothar felled that man, too, like helpless timber.

We marched back to the city to claim our 320 crowns. That was what Gernot's life cost. An old friend and travelling companion. A veteran of so many great conflicts. Felled by a boy with a blade. The reality sunk in the next morning when, out of nothing more than necessity, I handed over Gernot's spear and shield to yet another doe-eyed farmer who would never know the great hands that once wielded those tools so deftly. Would his fate be the same? Would he taste greatness before his inevitable fall? Time would tell.

This game somehow manages to weave together brutal and enjoyable gameplay like the lovechild of Mount & Blade and Darkest Dungeon. The stories aren't written for you, but they rise out of your connection to favorite party members and the unforgiving nature of the combat. It's incredibly hard to not reload a failed combat, but the struggle to rise back up and stand on your feet again is half of what makes this game so much fun.

The great:

What could be better:
 - Characters take too long to level, and games can take too many hours. I wish there was an option to make game shorter. This limits one of the strengths of the game which is replayability.

19,51758853,english,"Battle Brothers is a very atmospheric game. If the setting sounds interesting to you, that is if you like the idea of leading a bunch of quirky mercenaries from all kinds of backgrounds (beggars, farmers, hunters, raiders, monks, nobles, etc.) with a randomly generated backstory and a changeable appearance (from stoic to criminal or deranged looks that give the characters personality) in a down to earth low fantasy world, then this game might just be for you.

I love the written texts, I love the art style and I love the combat system. It all fits together splendidly and pushes all the right buttons to stimulate my imagination. The combat system is also elaborate (you decide how to specialize a character according to his stats, traits and future potential) and sometimes unfair (random crossbow bolt to a characters head, unfair starting positions in a fight, very tough combination of enemies, etc.). Most people who have a problem with that should just not play on ironman mode and instead reload and replay the battle.

It has been long overdue for me to write a review. BB is probably my favorite of all my steam games. And just look at how much I played this. It has tremendous replay value as well. No map is the same. A lot of things change from game to game simply by the way the randomly generated map is set up. You will always have different trade goods, you will encounter differents types of enemies more or less, be able to recruit certain character backgrounds more or less, nobles houses will be stronger or weaker and randomly generated (mostly interesting for the war endgame crisis) and so on and so forth.

If the game looks interesting to you and you're not a wuss, just get this. Chances are you won't regret it.

42,51589922,english,"Battle Brothers is possibly one of my most favorite games I played in recent years. It does so much right, from having just the right aesthetics that match the theme of the game, to having solid mechanics that support the rogue-lite playstyle. 

BB is a turn-based strategy, not unlike the XCOM series, but set in the middle ages. You head a mercenary company that sets out to do one thing: get rich. To do this you must recruit mercenaries from all walks of life and pray they survive long enough to get good at what they do. You take on missions from towns to get money and spread word of your company's deeds. As your renown grows you are given more more rewards for missions, but they also become more challenging. 

What I like is that you don't have to play the hero, and choosing the right battles to fight is an important part of the game. There are many enemies out there that will steamroll you if you don't have the right builds, equipment, or strategies. So you have to play smart. 

The down side is that the game is all about risk mitigation, both in macro management (choosing the right battles) as in the micro management in combat. Your attacks always go on a hit or miss roll, so you tend to be at the mercy to the RNG gods from time to time. It can be incredibly frustrating to have won the battle, but the last enemy gets a lucky crit and kills one of your high level brothers. Not to mention the fear a master archer, an arbalester, or a Goblin Boss, who with their arrow shenanigans can kill one of your guys in an unlucky instant as well. 

The game advertises these downsides as part of the game, and recommends you play in ironman mode to reduce the ability to save scum. All the same, it requires a healthy dose of determination to continue playing if you lose one of your core group, which can be incredibly frustrating. Unlike games like dark souls, where usually you die because YOU made a mistake, in this game you can die because of a random chance. 

All that said, I love the lore, and a lot of the RNG can be mitigated by solid strategies and mastery of the mechanics. Despite its RNG'ness, this is one of my favorite games and earns a solid recommendation for anyone who is a fan of Turn Based Strategy.",1561775781,1561775781,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197970362823,145,1,37128,0,20517,1597465528,,

Game is Mount&Blade with turn-based combat on a hex grid. It's missing a proper tutorial; in its place, you get a link to a YouTube developer Let's Play, which you will have to watch if you want to know how to do battle properly. It's 40 minutes long. Once you do get into the game proper,  is -very- slow and repetitive: you will be doing the same contracts a million times over, skipping the same well-written event text for the billionth time, going through the same old trading route, and fighting battles that are not very different from each other, slowly levelling up your mercenary band until you decide you've done a good enough job and retire. There's no real “main questline”, so you can just keep playing until you get bored of a particular map. The battles themselves are also frustratingly slow -- there's an option to have the enemies move faster, but you'll quickly start to feel they're not moving fast enough even with that option on. And God forbid you ever make the mistake of joining a large battle with more than two sides.

There are other annoyances, like the “retreat” button that turns your mercenaries into idiots, or “how it's meant to be played” ironman mode making the game freeze for a few seconds every time you open your inventory or enter a town. And yet, I still wanted to keep playing -- for 260 hours now, apparently -- just because of how intense the game is: a poorly chosen battle due to overconfidence, not being careful enough, or simply due to a streak of unlucky rolls -- and someone in your band dies. Or survives, but just barely. You can only field 12 mercenaries in a battle, and you can only have 20 in total at the same time, so one man's death is a pretty big deal. And it will happen a lot. Heck, your entire band might be wiped out due to a single lapse of judgement, and that intensity kept me going for so long; it alone carries the game enough for me to give it a Steam thumbs up. Mind you, even if most of your mercenaries die, the game won't end there: as long as you have just a single crippled man somewhere in your reserve, you can still recruit new soldiers and rebound. The contracts scale to your band's level, so the game always feels like a challenge, and if you get wiped, you can still come back into it and achieve and surpass your former glory.",1551823537,1561009523,True,3,1,0.532993674278259277,0,True,False,False,76561198026999552,386,87,20595,52,15558,1602035973,,

After some Time the Devs. decided to come back to Battle Brothers and release new Free-LC und DLC and this was a good decision on their part. I will not review the additional DLC Content they added in because that would be its own review and id like to do that on the seperate store page.
After some fixes and balance Patches the game us much more playable and not so repetetieve as it was before. Dont get me wrong its still a big Grind if you want to level up your Bros and maybe it will get boring after some time. But with the new Monsters and Enemys its much more entertaining and i found myself in very dire fights much more times than before.

All in all i can now recommend BB because its more polished and the Devs. are actually listening to the Playerbase that supports them.

OLD Review:
This Game is not bad but sadly it is just one of the EA ""cashgrab"" titels. Battle Brothers could have been such an epic Game but now after Update 1.1 the Devs abondoned the Project to move on to the next Game. In the EA- and Alphaphase they told us what we could get and what fun and challenging ideas the had for the Future of this titel but they now they ""finished"" it and stoped working. So this means no Mod-Support, grindy gameplay, the same battles over and over again with no diversity and ultimatly a game that is fun for a cupple of hours but nothing special to remamber. I played this game over 100 Hours in hope that they would add new and exciting enemys or storrys but the didnt. Only orks, Humans and Undead. All of them are boring after some battles.
I now have to down vote this Game. It is not worth the price. Not after the Devs ""finished"" the Project even when they told us in the Alpha what we could get and keept us hyped for new and awsome advantures we, in the end, didnt even get.",1502125505,1560504631,True,0,0,0.548048794269561768,0,True,False,False,76561197999637636,316,25,36201,0,6026,1600802545,,
86,51213675,english,"Ajsborn got into an argument with his only employee. She began offering it for whatever fee she saw necessary. A mercenary captain of the Battle Brothers, a small but slightly known company, wandered into the street as they argued. His employee offered herself to the captain at the price she wanted. Ajsborn demanded the captain refuse and tell her, a pimp was what was best for her. Instead of getting involved the captain told a monk in his employ to have at it. This preacher came forward and Ajsborn expected a lecture. Instead the monk merely told Ajsborn god gives people certain talents. How was he supposed to be a pimp if he couldn't control one single woman and pimps were supposed to have many women? The preacher said his name was Anvar and invited him to join the company. Ajsborn  considering the warning asked to join and the captain said yes.
 
 Ajsborn became known as Ajsborn the Pimp and was put into the reserve as he had no combat talents. The captain said he wouldn't turn down a free recruit when they were about to go deep into the wild to hunt a goblin raider camp. For 4 days they marched, fighting minor skirmishes along the way. Ajsborn saw no action. Finally the goblin camp was on the horizon. they attacked at night to minimize the infamous goblin ambushers. Ajsborn was left behind to guard the wagon. A few hours later the company returned. 2 men had fallen, including the mighty Emmerich the Footman. He had slain dozens but this time fell to a lucky arrow. 
  
  The captain gave Ajsborn Emmerich's gear and asked him merely to hold the top of the line as they marched home. Almost back to civilization without incident a lonely fort stood at the base of a mountain. The company up for some easy plunder charged in headlong. Unfortunately the former stronghold now housed the undead. They attacked the company with superior numbers. As luck would have it Ajsborn was far away from the Necromancer and his weirdgangers. The captain told him to hold the rear and the rest of the company marched on the profane spellcaster and his minions. After the company marched away a fallen hero of a bygone age and a weirdganger still in their armor came out of the fog of war to flank them. There was only one thing standing in the way. Ajsborn. From his bottleneck in the rock Ajsborn battled the 2  round after round. He held them at bay until the necromancer was slain with most of the weirdgangers. Just as the company rounded back to fight the fallen hero, he stabbed Ajsborn through the neck.
   
  The company was able to double back and surround the fallen hero. Trapped in a sea of swords and spears finally the fallen hero received a redeadening. The pimp, the company had just hired, rose from the grave to have his head removed by a spear from the company's sergeant, Torkel. The company now sings the Ballad of the Pimp as they march from town to town. He never slew an enemy nor finished a battle but if it hadn't been for Ajsborn the Pimp the Battle Brothers would be no more.

  This is just one story of a very unimportant character and event in the beginning of a campaign in this game. The game is able to suck you into the management and outcomes of your company.

But then I decided whatever and to at least try it out. At first I had a learning curve and felt the game was unbalanced, but I got used to it. The thing I had to realize was that I had to be careful of the fights I was getting in to, and that there were fights I could not win no matter how hard I tried at this stage. But then around day 70 I noticed he marauders were starting to AVOID me rather than chase me. It was around then I got used to the game's mechanics, and it's perfectly fine to play beginner if you suck like me.

The thing that really made me fall in love with this game was around day 170. The Noble's war had just ended and I had gotten what I thought was just another contract. I was supposed to hunt down another barbarian king, and return. Well I noticed this king had a different variety of soldiers, but I didnt really care and went in anyway. What surprised me was that he wanted to parlay! He told me that there was an even greater threat than him, that there was a massive army of the undead to wage war with the living, and that they had to be stopped. I could either fight the king and get my gold or help them fight the undead. Well I decided to help them, and the army I fought was 20 undead skeleton legionares. Including in this 20 was an undead priest and 2-honor guards that took out most of his army that helped me. I was amazed, and completely captivated.

I think a lot of people's gripe with this game is that it's difficulty has to do with missing every single hit. I agree that it feels very unfair and it made me rage quit a few times, but I noticed that on beginner you miss a lot less. I had to swallow my pride to play on beginner, and still got my ass handed to me by goblins more than once. If you dont care about having a good challenge there is a mod called Ultra Bros that basically lets you cheat. I used it only once or twice, because I dont like cheating personally.

Overall I absolutely love this game and think that theres a lot of content for anybody to enjoy. Cannot recommend enough.

96,51123314,english,"A spectacularly difficult game full of rogue-like elements, randomly generated features, and tons of replayability.

Battle Brothers is a game that tasks you with the management of a mercenary company based in a medieval/fantasy world. The world/game map is determined by a seed that you can either randomly generate or input manually at the start of your campaign. This seed will determine the geography, the factions, and even the randomized abilities and stats associated with your starting character(s). The game, although simply illustrated, accurately depicts equipment your characters wear, and does boil down to an RRPG for each of your characters. At often times, the Farmers you recruit from villages and drop in chainmail and give a spear are going to have traits like ""club-footed, drunkard, clumsy, coward, etc.""...which are negatives usually, but every once in a while, you'll recruit characters that have traits like ""strong, brave, etc."" These characters also have stats, and a number of stars associated next to each statistic indicates how many randomized points you'll be able to drop into that skill each time they level. They also have skill trees, allowing you to invest in their learning speed, their various defense/offenses...and even, at higher levels, giving certain characters second or third winds that allow your 2-handed swordsmen to cut down 3-4 enemies in a single one of his turns.

I needed to preface this review with all of that so you can see just how randomized everything in this really is. 

Graphics wise, Battle Brothers is simple artwork. You'll like it if you had an appreciation for games like ""Knights of Honor,"" or even ""Dragon's Crown,"" which feature more artwork than 3-dimensional graphics. Despite all of that, the lack of combat animations, the simple ""hops"" your characters make as they move around tile to tile in their turn-based combat scenarios,  the game is not ugly by any means. I daresay it's actually quite simple and refreshing, and I haven't gotten tired of looking at it in over 170 hours of gameplay.

Gameplay wise, this game is tense and challenging. Your troops are paid salary and need to be fed. Their morale needs to be kept up. They'll face overwhelming odds and take losses and hits to their morale. That being said, a majority of your time is spent deciding whether to take on contracts from towns (the coin they reward is not always worth it, especially for long delivery missions, ESPECIALLY if your map doesn't have good travel routes). Completing these will pit you against enemies, drive your reputation upward with the town and faction it belongs to (there's a few kingdoms/duchies that are at play on this map)...all of this earns your guys experience, coin, food, and equipment. Essentially, this is a rinse/repeat process until your guys are leveled, and you go into the later elements of the game where you end up fighting for the monarchies instead of individual villages. There are end-game crises that result in cities being overrun by undead, greenskins...or maybe just all out war between the kings and dukes on the map. Regardless, the need to accept a new contract and earn the coin is always there...even later on.

10/10

Battle Brothers, in terms of all of its randomized mechanics, cutesy art style bloodshed, is an absolute joy to play. Find yourself a good seed, and I'd recommend the ""lone wolf"" origin story when you work up to it. I do have a beginner's tip for you as well.

Beginner's Tip: You're going to meet some pretty large hordes on the road in your exploits. Early on, it's actually important you know when to turn and run, regardless of how strong your guys are. The game doesn't intend for every confrontation to be winnable. But...if you keep an eye on your group when they travel, and manage the pause control effectively and keep enemies from engaging them that overpower your group, you can actually prevent the engagement and ""flee"" mechanic and just travel along the road away from the enemy. Now, here's a kicker: Draw them to a nearby village or...even better, stronghold. When the enemy approaches, the city will send out a sortie to confront it. Join the battle once they engage, and rush your troops across the map to get into the fray....but, instead of just outright targeting the enemy, use as many friendly fire moves you can on the city's garrison troops. They'll never actually realize it's intentional, won't return fire, and hopefully...will die at times. These troops drop elaborate sets of high-quality equipment. If you manage to kill a friendly knight in one of these little confrontations, you could be running around a guy in platemail with a 2-handed Greatsword as early as turn 10...which is otherwise impossible and...at this point in the game, no bandit could withstand you. But yes, this does make you a bit of a jerk; you're killing your allies and stealing their super-cool gear, after all.

The most immediate comparison which comes to mind is X-Com, and the developers have even said in an interview that the first concept was a melee, medieval X-com, but the game has clearly become its own thing. The graphics are low-key but have a distinct style and can be surprisingly visceral at times and the soundtrack is superb. The combat system is very robust and it's interesting to figure out new strategies as the game opens up and gives you more possibilities, while you encounter more dangerous enemies. The AI of your enemies is very impressive, and is clearly a feature which was worked hard on. Most of the times it behaves as a worthy opponent and each type of enemy has it's own way to approach combat, which makes fights with different enemies have its own rythm and challenges. The management part of the game is quite good as well, as your funds are very limited and you have a lot of different ways to spend it, but rarely enough to get everything you want or need. 

The game is sandbox-y, similar to the old microprose x-com games, but there are a few distinctions, the most important one being that your company is always on the move. Since there is no base to upgrade the focus of the game is clearly on combat and levelling up and gearing up your units. There is no clear goal until later in the game where a so called endgame crisis happens, which can be a little off putting to some, but I believe that the robust combat mechanics and diverse encounters stand as a solid pillar to provide many hours of enterntainment regardless. 

Combat mechanics deserve their own little paragraph. There are no classes in the game, any mercenary can use any weapon and any skill unlocked via a tier list of perks, as they level up. Despite that, there are many different ways to make your guys feel different to one another, most importantly via the stats which you increase as they level up - you got a choice from 3 out of 8 statistics, and each brother can have a different starting attribute and aptitude to how many points they get per level. Weapons and armour play a big role as well with each type of weapon having distinct statistics and are good at something specific. Axes can break shield and are solid against armour, spears have low damage but give a bonus to hit, two handed weapons can possibly hit several enemies at once, maces can stun and reduce the fatigue of the enemy... there are a lot of considerations and gearing up your company for the different challenges is interesting and challenging on its own. As your mercenaries, and most other enemies, walk and fight they accumulate the so called fatigue. When the fatigue meter is full, they cannot perform any other action. Combined with a very limited amount of action points and mechanics such as surround to hit bonus and elevation bonus and penalty it  makes the combat an interesting, and often bloody affair.

The game has its flaws, the biggest one in my opinion being a fairly standard setting. Even though the enemies you encounter behave in their own unique way, many of them are unfortunately from the standard grim fantasy repertoire - spiders, wolves, bandits, zombies and skeletons are not terribly interesting as a concept, even though fighting them can be.  It can also be exceedingly punishing before you figure out how to manage your limited early funds, when all your units are hot garbage and you fight the enemies with wooden sticks and broken swords. Some difficulty spikes can straight up lead to a party wipe, and learning which contracts and enemies to avoid can be a steep learning curve because of that. Your units can't take many hits for most of the game and the chance to hit goes from 5 to 95%, so the hits are not certain and neither are misses.

Battle Brothers is one of the most engaging games of its kind and stands out as a worthy effort, and a good buy for anyone who enjoys challenging, tactical battles and managing your own band of misfits. Cracking the game enough to overcome the initial difficulty spikes can be painful, but also incredibly rewarding and I cannot recommend it enough.",1559987444,1559987444,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197982277013,435,3,12744,0,10478,1597761483,,

Spent a lot of hours playing it and intending to spend a lot more.
Careful: this games makes hours fly by like nothing else.

Overall score: 9/10

Advantages:

- Overall climate of the game
- Amazing music !!!
- Randomness everywhere == endless repliability. Also its fun-like RNG. Some of it you control more, some less. But important RNG you have control over by being good at the game.
- Huge number of backgrounds - each with individual strenghts and weaknesses. 
- Character talents and perks - you might have a great background with high base stats, but not talented and with negative perks (dumb, fat etc.) or a talented lowborn with positive perks (quick, determined, etc.). Part of your journey is to pick from what you are offered. You won't always get the best people and you will have to make due with what you have and what your money allows for.
- Dozens of weapons and armor types, famed items
- Many quests and ways of earning money
- Positive/negative event system based on the composition of your team (background interactions)
- Different types of enemies with different combat behaviour. Each requires different strategy and team composition.
- The feeling of ""attachment"" to your troops as the game progresses. Losing people HURTS (if you Iron man it up)
- Random map generation - you can always play a different scenario but you can also use the seed to play the same one if you like it (some parts will still be different)
- Character stats: hp, fatigue, melee skill, ranged skill, melee def, ranged def, resolve, etc. Forces you to properly distribute your experience ""points"" to achieve balance per character and in a team overall. 
- Huge amount of data hidden from a player - stat rolls, details of talent system, strenght of opponents etc. You learn as you play ""the hard way"" - but you can also use a wiki and have a peak. Complexity == fun
- The game is challenging - positioning mistake will cost you in difficult fights. Getting surrounded == dying.
- Pernament injuries (sometimes your character may not die, but will get a permanent debuff). May be insignificant of crippling, but you get to keep him :P
- Mods support. Some mods, mostly quality of life ones, massively improve gameplay experience without hidering the core mechanics - download and try them (TryOut mod, FastCombat, anything in FilthyRobot mod pack) - hopefully some of them will be incorporated to the main game as they are amazing.
DLC:
- Added ""starting scenarios"" - you can start as farmers, deserters or even start with a single dude. Adds even more repliability.
- I am sure I am forgetting something... Explore it yourself :P

Negatives:

- Some character backgrounds are pure trash and you pretty much never want them. Would be nice if there was more incentive to use them - mb. more events that give pernament bonuses or sth, like tailor (trash) could craft you some nice light armor the higher level he is (through event) etc.
- Feels a bit grindy late game (days > 300), usually when you completed most challenges. Definetely can be improved by adding more late game stuff. But you can remedy that by starting a new run - new people - new stats - new map :P
- Goblins. I hate these little green sh*** and those fights tend to be really annoying (or a snooze fest if you have great archers). Guess they are supposed to be annyoing but mb there is a way to do it differently.
- Some puzzle fights - the issue is mostly with scaling their difficulty - 6 alps is super easy - 12 is DEATH for all your characters (fortunately there are ways around that). Also getting ambushed usually sucks but it's mostly based on the game speed you use which is weird - game should auto-pause to at least let you prepare, which you can do if you use low game speed (f.e do not run heavy archer lineups vs ancient undead, etc.)
- Needs better inventory management (something like Formation mod but without items dissapearing bugs :P) - it can be a pain to constantly switch between fights.

Btw. Ignore negative reviews of the people that complain that the game is RNG or too hard.
The problem with most people these days - they want to be guided through everything and achieve something without any effort. I will never understand that approach. Exploring is FUN.
Honestly - the challenge the game offers is one of it's biggest pluses. Also you do not have to play Iron man mode if you want the ability to use save option. I'd say learn a game by using save function - if you lose people - replay fight, but try something different. When you are ready - turn on iron man - thats where the real fun begins. 

TLDR: Just buy this game! It's awesome and great value for money

After playing this game a long time i have to say that most my games end up with me getting fed up with the rng. i invest days in leveling up top bros just to watch them all get killed by some beserker with a chain, with a s**** chance to hit. Last game i was around day 400, contracts dont get you enough money to sustain your company, have to alt f4 all the time because of shhit rng, just gets so frustrating that i had to delete the save just to not trow my monitor out of the window.

Make a hard game but give players a way to replace their losses, right now is just to many grind to level up a bro just to loose him to a stupid rng. If you want a game to have fun dont play this.

You will whiff important attacks, you will have times when you cant even buy a hit on an enemy, there will be times where your shields are as effective as essential oils...but thats the same as any chance based game. I feel what makes this game special is the flavor text, the music, the feeling of combat when it goes your way, getting your elite team of bros geared up and hunting some of the big baddies...it's all just so satisfying when it clicks into place.

62,34766768,english,"I wanted to like it, went over my normal budget for what I thought it was worth.  I like turn based games, (Xcom is my all time favorite) and of the batch I bought I played this one first. 

I am giving up on it.  

I'll start with what I liked.  I liked the setting, the text vignettes of events, the idea of managing a mercenary company.  I liked the Germanic background (as I'm about to start German classes) and the art style, the bobblehead characters somehow fit.  

The game at it's core is a combat game.  I tried what I thought would work on my own (pikemen behind shields) with ok results.  Not that great, getting beat up bad against Orcs and Goblins.  I went online, read some battletips about how great bows are.  I tried several bow mercs that constantly got slaughtered first.  It almost seems the AI has better range/aim.  I went back to my shield/pikemen approach, which works pretty good but I still take some losses and am grinding a living.  I went online and read about picking your battleground, dont just charge their archers.  I read the various factions faq.  I just quit ragequit the game after brigands would not charge me, I spent turns moving back and then they just won't come, they will wait until the end of time on the higher-ish better ground.  Now, maybe that would make sense in real life but this is a game (not to mention I read that strategy online, maybe a new build killed it).  You don't have enough of an edge in combat to go charging in all the time, and the AI is a tad bit clunky.  Everytime I move I end up with like 1-2 actions points and I have to spacebar (wait) or return (end turn) and then ... it's hard to explain, but believe me moving is a tad clunky on the interace and then having the AI wait me out was the final straw.  

I give up.

------------------------------------

So on a whim I gave this game another chance, years later and with DLC.  I'm changing my review to positive.  First off, they included an easier difficulty level.  This made the game less unbelievably frustrating, for someone new to this game but not turn-based games.  I'm starting campaign 2 with a different group on the middle difficulty (since you can now pick different company backgrounds).  I did try a Viking-ish background, I'm not even sure how you survive that one (I got wiped in week 1 'cause most towns hated me and it was veteran difficulty), but it's a neat option.

The game feels kinda fleshed out, different character background have different events.  

I liked the DLC additions.  

There's an endgame crisis, now that I finally played it longer.   There's good and bad to that.  One thing I wasn't expecting so much to be the great big crusader -- since it's a mercenary company.  There were a couple flavor texts about a Greenskin invasion and I'd see them on a map more.  (minor spoiler) My final mission happened to be a caravan escort contract, and I got attacked countless times -- normally you have one battle or two per contract, I had six or seven that wiped out lots of the company and I wasn't set up for it.  There's only one quicksave, so I couldn't go back to before I started the endless series of battles.  Anyway, right after that I blew 20k on new supplies -- and the game said the Greenskin crisis is over and now I can retire.  Anyway -- it would have been nice to see some foreshadowing of how the game arcs.

Some minor interface issues, the skip turn and end turn button on screen are tiny -- and used alot ... you can use keyboard but it was annoying to have to do it with every character all the time.

68,50770501,english,"This is a very RNG heavy game.  As such, people die very quickly regardless of the difficulty you play on. Be aware going in that this game is difficulty to master and can be extremely frustrating if you don't like random world creation or RNG battles like in Xcom.

If you are looking for LITE/DIET Mount and Blade, this is it.  You play as a mercenary company. However, although you can only play as a merc company (there is no castle or town conquest and ruling) there have been added origins that provide a unique flavor for your playthrough.  The most fun of these is the Lone Wolf origin which allows the player to insert themself into the company.  You are no longer the off-screen manager which provides immersion and stake in the well-being of the merc company since if your player character dies, its game over.  The avatar/player character perk should be toggable and added to other playstyles for the immersion factor of the game.

The game has a large amount of ways that you can form your company.  Weapons and armors abound as well as a skill tree that you use to customize individual mercenaries.  All-in-all there is a great deal of control you have of your playstyle which is needed for later gameplay.  For instance, use spears and shields against undead who throw themselves at your front line.  Make an archer heavy squad against goblins who fight at range.

While the tactics you can employ against the enemy are diverse, a strength of the game is the enemy AI.  Different factions fight in different ways. Barbarians (in the awesome expansion) fight by unleashing a row of wardogs, then moving to medium rang and peppering you with thrown weapons, before closing gap.  Undead simply march at you. Goblins try to flank you and stay at range to poison you.  This is all fairly sophisticated for factions to fight in different ways which forces the play to adapt which is very enjoyable.

The added origins and the new Barbarian expansion adds much needed flavor to the game.  While I want to see more in terms of factions, a bigger map, and more immersion by adding a toggle for the player character perk, the game as it stands is very enjoyable.  It provided me a Mount and Blade feel or small experience while I wait for it Bannerlord to release.... Which it may never.

While the random factor in this game is pretty significant, it can still be fairly circumvented by strategic thinking, picking your targets and retreating when it's apparent that things could go out of hand.
It's not unlike the new XCOM games, with the enemies hitting you 15 times in a row for a ~20% chance and you being unable to get those 95% (upper chance cap) hits when you need them most. However, just like XCOM, as long as you heed Sun Tsu's teachings and position yourself properly the game shines with it's plethora of combat puzzles.

On the world map, the game plays more like Mount and Blade (or so I thought by mistake)
Truth is, there's a lot less content on the macro scale then during combat. The game world is empty and inert when compared to some similar titles.

If there's a goal to the game, it's probably to defeat a few epic monsters (I managed to defeat Ijiork or whatever the spirit is called) and afterwards the game simply fell apart in terms of engagement. The game is a huge grind, lacking in adventuring options, progression options and replay value. True, there are alternate starts and randomized terrain but it doesn't change how the game plays mid-late game once you get over starting obstacles (there is maybe 1 exception, the Lone Wolf playthrough, but it's as hardcore as Sekiro and a lot less fun) 

Disclaimer: I don't know if I ruined this game for myself by watching skilled players plow through the game but I got really excited after seeing how well you need to use terrain, time of day and various equipment to get the edge. Sadly, the reason  they don't have an easy mode is because it would remove all of the tedious grind that blocks progression. That grind is essential to providing more hours of playtime because there's very little content in the world even with all the DLC.

This game is a pure joy to play. All the new starts and events added to the game really make each new start fresh and different. Not only have they added a few things here and there with the most resent few updates but they have also added a lot of depth through non combat encounters. The world feel like its carrying on with or without you. That being said, any new players need to know this:

THIS GAME IS TRYING TO KILL YOU! 

Right from the start you have to be smart with a lot of things. Most important is choosing the right kind of fights that your Man's can take, second is knowing the different kinds of weapons and the situations they excel in, and last is knowing how to make money constantly. Where iv seen a lot of people quit is when they have about 5-9 hours of game time. They think they have the movement and weapons down, but you don't. You take a bad fight and get wrecked, rage quit, and that's that. It needs to be said again, This Game Is Trying To Kill You. Your Men's will die, they will. There is not much you can do most times except try and postpone their death, that alone is an important skill. 

If I were to want any kinds of changes to this game it would be with how they display the stats of the weapons. Currently they don't tell you how each types bonuses effect their chance to hit (if any). The sword class and spear class give extra hit chance to you man, but that isn't shown anywhere. More transparency with how the weapon classes effect your Man would make the introduction to this game much easier. 

Also add more banners please!  

In closing, get this game if you want a real feeling squad battle game where anything can happen and does. Where making it to the end is more about who can you lose and stay a strong then about making it cleanly across the finish line.

 Get this game.

That's ok though, because at the end of the day the presents he gives you will last you longer than the abuse ever does.

Longer version:

I'm currently nearing 100 hours of gameplay, and I've been around since launch. Most of the complaints I've seen for the game are either from isolated crashes or people upset about getting hit with bad RNG. This game is incredibly RNG heavy, obviously, and sometimes there is nothing you can do (short of save scumming) to save yourself from a fight. That's the point. 

I love that no matter how competent you are at the game (and yes there is a 'meta game' here if you search for it), and how geared you are, you'll almost always be facing a challenge. If you're playing on the higher difficulties, there's really no such thing as an 'easy' run. Taking a turn 1 crossbow bolt to the face with a 18% chance to hit on your best guy is frustrating sure, but the experience of coming back after your company falls on hard times is equally as satisfying. The first playthrough will be incredibly unforgiving, but once you learn your limits as a company the game really starts to open up.

The sounds in this game are amazing, from combat noises to the music. The crippling anxiety this game leaves you with will start to flare up everytime you hear the incredibly unsatisfying twang of an enemy crossbow firing at your men. Likewise, nothing will leave you more hyped than the incredible battle music you'll hear as your only named brother (the one you told yourself not to get attached to) get's surrounded and mauled by goblins with armor piercing swords.

If you don't mind getting reminded by the game every now and then that your company of Bros aren't invincible, and like reading the impressive amount of flavor text present in basically everything, than I cannot recommend this game enough. You'll have the same love-hate relationship for this game that you experience every time you look in the mirror, but at the end of the day you're still here reading this review, so it can't be THAT bad.

A lot of variety is added by the different types of enemies bringing their own strengths and weaknesses to the battlefield and therefore require different strategies or team compositions, builds and even weaponry.

This game is really great and you should get it.  Some people don't like the art style, but it's actually really intricate and there's a method to the madness.  It is awesome seeing the looks on your battle brothers' faces change over the course of the battle.

This game is very deep, and has vastly improved since early access.

Pros:
One of the deepest tactical combat systems
Open-world/non-linear story with lots of depth
Grit and style
variety of enemies
DIFFICULT

Cons:
DIFFICULT
world doesn't breathe much, pretty static outside of events
brutal difficulty on ironman

Original Review:

I've played BB 30 hours so far, and have enjoyed it quite a bit.  The fun for me in a game is exploring the mechanics of the game.  Once I've seen everything a game has to offer, I tend to lose interest.  That is sort of where I'm at with this game right now.  But that is to be expected, because the game is basically just a framework right now: You level your guys up, and get better gear, so you can tackle bigger fish inside this sandbox.  

There are still issues to work out, and right now the maps get kind of stale once you've moved around in them and discovered most of what there is to discover.  But all this is basically a placeholder so you can play it now, before it's done.  They have much bigger goals for a real, changeable world in future releases, where there are forces doing things behind the scenes, and your choices and battles affect the larger world.  Their goals kind of remind me of a Dwarf-Fortress-like world where you are impacting the world, but part of the fun is that the world will be different each time.  I am looking forward to future versions!",1447181140,1557592384,True,3,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198035949064,117,3,391709,18993,3465,1602090600,,
79,21533270,english,"""When I originally looked at this game on Steam I had little to no interest in it. I thought the premise was cool but I have never been a fan of turn based RTS games. One rainy day I had money burning a hole in my Steam wallet and I bought it, to say that I was pleasantly surprised is a gross understatement. Games like Interstellar Marines killed my faith in early access but this game has restored it. I love the low fantasy Medieval theme, and the art style is simple yet beautiful. On the surface the game seems fairly straight forward and easy to grasp. I thought it was going to be a cake walk, but I was taken aback by the hidden intricacies and depth of the game. I have been eagerly awaiting the new update scheduled for tomorrow: 02/29/2016 which is notable because this is a leap year. I just can't stop thinking about how much more enjoyable the game will be with the new changes and I already have a blast playing it. I really appreciate how active and dedicated the development team is, and I have a strong feeling that they will deliver an amazing product once the game is fully released. 10/10 Donkeypunches, 7/7 Stars, 34289/34289 Orc Warriors. I would recommend this game to anyone who has the sensibility to appreciate a well done project.""

That is the review I wrote during the early access stage of the game. So how is it now you might ask? Well, in a word, stellar. The development team has treated this game with love and dedication, and their hard work shows through. The base game itself has quite a bit to offer, with an open ended campaign, various scenarios, and a free hand to do as you please. There's no end to how many different worlds you can travel in this game, and how many different ways you can approach them. The most recent DLC added various new campaign starts, such as a lonesome hedge knight, or a fanatical cult. This is by far my favorite RPG, and the best turn based game I've played.

+ good artwork
+ gritty vibe
+ hex grid battles 

negatives:
- slow as hell (as in game speed balance is slow, not performance)
- weird rule system (items armor perks level up nothing makes sense)
- unrealistic strategy (intuitive strategies do not pay back, gotta learn how the game wants you to play it)
- buggy interface  (at this day and age :P)
- uninteresting world generation (lots of features on the map, nothing going on)

Overall this is a really boring game with a lot of promising features of which all are unfulfilled. 
You can see the efforts being make to remain gritty and realistic while the game falters to tie them together in a coherent ruleset. I think I will play it a bit further just to see if it gets interesting at all, but I am not going to enjoy it. 

I got a mount and blade on a grid vide from it and bought it. Hopefully it will get better in the future, if they make a sequel of sorts. The developers have their hearts in the the right place.

2,48627623,english,"Graphics: 
Very simplistic but beautiful and clean. 6/10

Gameplay:
It's addicting and way more fun than I initially thought, when I first saw the screenshots. 
Movement on the overworld is simple as well, but good. You can visit all cities on the map right after the first fight. The map is open and hides an innumerable ammount of turn based battles and secret locations in the fog of war. While you travel with your own mercenary band, you need supplies such as food, tools, or medical supplies. The mecanics are easy to understand but hard to master. It adds to the realism, which is great. Fights are fun, but take some time in the lategame, when there are 20-40 bandits/orcs in one army. Still, it gets addicting to smash a group of brigants with your heavy greatsword guys, while your bowmen pick of the lesser armored enemies in the backlines. Every enemy has it's own strenght and weaknesses. Sometimes you have to arm your men with two handed weapons for raw damage, sometimes you set them up in a shieldwall to soak up an enemy charge, and sometimes you want your guys as mobile as possible. Since every enemy is different, you have to adapt fast or have a great strategy in mind, before you start the battle. 9/10

Content:
The campain is different every time. The overworld and all its cities, dungeons, lairs and stuff are randomized every time, so the replay value is great. Most of the events are randomized as well and you can encounter lots of funny, tragic or mysterious stories. Stories are text based, though, there are no voice narrating elements at all. Your brothers can have a plethora of backgrounds, such as fisherman, historian, hedge knight, for example. Every constelation of backgrounds has a chance to trigger random events, which can be a event such as a permanent buff to one of your brothers stats, a fight, or rare or unique items. Apropos items: There's a lot of weapons and armor, so you can choose exactly how your brothers look and fight. You can venture into the unknown wilderness and hunt for trophies from monsters or unique items, each with its very own story. 

Sound:
The sounds are overall decent and add to the immersive feeling. But what really stands out is the phenomenal soundtrack.
But you have to listen for yourself. 10/10 

Conclusion:
This game is a hidden gem. It's worth it, even if you pick it up for full price, to support the developers, who still, after almost two years after release, are still working on the game and adding content, such as the Beasts & Exploration dlc or the free content dlcs.


EDIT Warriors of the North DLC:
Still a fantastic game. But i have to tell you that it can get very frustrating, when the enemy manages to sneak a 5% shot inbetween your shield wall to miracliously headshot your low armor archer. Things like that happen a lot, especially on higher difficulty. Actually they happen so often that im not sure if its a feature or a bug. Have to cut two points from the gameplay score. 7/10",1548770867,1557519199,True,2,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198052988336,155,1,18007,0,14017,1588453807,,

Buy it to support the developers.  They are a small, dedicated team that listens to their community.  The game was a labor of love that I bought in Early Access.  They got plenty of feedback, overhauled the game and re-released.  They let us know that with some of the re-releases our old companies would be lost.  They're honest.  At some point they said, ""We completed it.  We love it, but we are moving on to work on a new game about World War II.""  The fans said thanks and kept playing.  The community kept posting discussion points about the game.  The developers then came back and released a DLC based on the communities points.  It's the way the gaming industry should work.  

And then they did it again!

Overall, an incredible game and I could not recommend it enough.

53,50486234,english,"The Game Itself: Absolutely awesome. The game plays like a medieval XCOM but it does not hold your hand. Your task is to lead your band of mercenaries from rock bottom into the history books, while filling your pockets. The world is unforgiving and there are often times you cannot win a fight without considerable losses, but this is part of the challenge. 

Character Freedom: Your brothers all have a personality which will evolve overtime. From their background before the company, the skills and talents they will learn and inevitably the injuries they will pick up, every character in the game is unique. None of them are bound to a class system and you can develop them as you see fit, often in a way that suits their natural strengths. This however means that even a lowly farmhand you pick up might have a natural talent for life as a mercenary and go on to be an absolute force in your shield wall. On the other hand you may hire a knight or a raider who is a coward at heart and has a tendency to run from enemies such as the undead. This really makes you feel as though it is how your men perform and the adventures they take part in which build their character, not just a class system with some numbers. Of course a knight with a lifetime of combat experience will usually run circles around the local grave robber but suprises can happen and both will have their time to shine in the random events that happen in your camp and around the world.

Tactical Freedom: Battle Brothers is the first game that truly lets you customise the way an entire unit of men fights. If you want to build your mercenary band around the proven style of a shield wall or a phalanx, you can do it. If you want to focus on archery and killing the enemy before your lines smash together, you can do it. If you want to equip every brother in your unit with throwing axes, a handaxe, a great axe and no armour to slow them down, you can do it (not recommended) Each style has its own weakness and some are much more effective than others against specific enemies. This can lead to some very intense moments when you will buy and equip very specific items and gear to combat a specifically hard enemy and gives off the same vibe as a game like the Witcher 3 does with its pre battle preparation phase.

The World/Enemies: As previously mentioned the world is extremely unforgiving. I would describe it as a world akin to the Witcher series (as this is loosely based on medieval Germany and the Witcher is loosely based on medieval Poland) with a slightly lower fantasy setting. Monsters are still an issue for people but you arent going to see them wipping out villages for the most part. In this world its important to remember that you control a band of normal human people and you are tasks with taking on beasts and other enemies of legend. This means that you are the underdog in most cases and will take a serious beating if you show up to a fight unprepared. Orcs are bigger and stronger than your men, The undead may be slow but you will have to kill them three times over for them to stay down and they have no morale penalties. Special undead types are even faster than your men and can expose any weakness in your formation in one turn. The beasts of the world can throw you around like pebbles or swarm you with ridiculous numbers. The only thing that will get you through all of this is a solid formation, good equipment and brothers who will improve from brawl to brawl. Within reason, no single character can deal with the enemies you will face. Hence the name Battle Brothers.

The Devs: These guys are really what makes the game as good as it is. Constant updates and bug fixes in the early days helped turn this game from an ok indie title into one of the hidden gems often found in the indie category. They have a very strong idea of what they want this game to be, a game in which you LEAD A MERCENARY COMPANY. You wont be base building or vying for control over the world in this game and you probably never will. Your job is to kill things get payed and build a reputation for yourself and thats the way it will stay for the foreseeable future.

DLC: Without a doubt the best DLC policy i have seen. The DLC that has been released and the upcoming Warriors of the north are both PROPER DLC's. What i mean by this is that they add significantly to the game in a way that makes the game feel new every time you enable a new DLC. They are akin to the old days of expansion packs where the content is as much or more than the original game. They add new enemies, encounters, mechanics, weapons and in the upcoming DLC company origins that fundamentally change how your entire campaign will be played. The DLCs are also extremely affordable for the sheer amount of content they provide. The company also releases supporters packs that you can pay extra for. These include a few skins for company customisation and are not anything major, they are simply a way to support the devs if you want to and i will certainly be buying the next one. 

Conclusion: Buy this game if you like its idea because that central theme is never going to change.

random generated map can make some missions difficult to find, as you cant google where the locastion is if you cant find it. Text on the map is hard to read sometimes.

Totally worth it if you are in to the UFO or Divinity: Original sin games.
Simple combat mechanics but very fulfilling. Great talent trees and a lot of  addistional mechanics like wounds and perminant wounds.

There is a tradeing system as well, you can buy goods or gain from combat and sell them in diffrince locastions for better price also there is a crafting system trough a taxadermist. 

Tons of missions that are your main source of income, Also there is a maintince system of food, ammo, medical supplys and matirial to maintain your armor.

66,50338976,english,"I seldom write reviews, but I must face the fact that Battle Brothers became my favourite computer game of all time.
I'm mostly a board game / table RPG player, so I strongly prefer turn-based games with interesting choices.

This is 5 things I love the most in Battle Brothers:
1. Fantastic, complexed, but not overcomplicated combat system.
2. The game is punishing but, if you won't load, but learn - also rewarding.
3. It's actually very well written - it have more RPG feeling than most cRPG titles.
4. Lost battle or two won’t end your game, you just have to adapt to survive.
5. Freedom of choice and style of play.

This is 5 new things I've learned while playing Battle Brothers:
1. You are your weapon! What you wear in combat is same - and sometimes more - significant than what you're actually good at. It’s very different approach from other games with RPG-structure – but I find it accurate, when you think of the real battle situation.
2. You have to adapt, every time, all the time.
3. You can't become overconfident. Seriously, the game will sure let you know when you'll get to that point.
4. You will fail sometimes. It’s not something that will end your game though, if you play it right. I’ve never ended the game with just clear raw of wins. My company was running, hiding, sacrificing the life of it’s best men to cover the fleeing of the rest after an ambush.
5. Dying can be a part of fun. Losing your best men in the battle is painful but also memorable.

68,30712816,english,"A potentially wonderful game, ruined by pretense, gimmicks, and lack of ambition.

Pros - 

1. Wonderful turn-based tactical battle system that requires skill and thought, as opposed to luck, with loads of weapons, armor, skills etc.
2. Solid graphics and art for a 2D game.
3. Players have some amount of control over the difficulty by being cautious about the challenges they undertake, or take risks.
4. All characters are properly modeled, with charming background stories, unique names and appearance (most of the time). You can further customize and improve them through RPG-lite elements.

Cons -

Everything that happens between the battles basically.

1. Events and actions are rare. You will spend most of the time walking around the landscape.
2. Rewards are small, prices are high. The things you can do are usually outweighed by things you cant - armor and weapons that are too expensive, recruits that ask for too much upkeep, battles that you can not fight or win because your squad is not equipped or fit enough.... unless you go through the tedious grind.
3. Features like permanent injuries are a complete waste of time. It would have been interesting if the player had a genuine reason to keep a maimed party member around (eg a maimed soldier going into battle inspires his fellows, or eventually becomes a legendary figure like Logen Ninefingers or Dujek Onearm). Ultimately it is a waste of time and / or resources for the player.
[strike]4. Almost every event or happenstance that you come across will be detrimental to your party. It eventually becomes a frustrating and tiresome gimmick.[/strike] ([i]this is no longer the case during my current playthrough. I encountered quite a few positive events, that increase the stats of characters, or gives free resources etc[/i])
5. The game-world - ie AI factions and parties on the map are not fleshed out. It is even more basic than Mount and Blade.
6. Still quite a few promised interesting features are missing, like Battle Sisters, non-combat party members, non-European factions. Hopefully we will get them in a DLC.
7. Weird time-wasting restrictions, eg you can only accept one mission at a time, even if you get multiple offers that require you to go to the same destination.

All that converts what could have been a brilliant Mercenary Sim into a gimmicky survival game. Buries the brutally glorious tactical battles, the main selling point for me, under a thick tedious layer of grind.

The world feels like a complete, living thing that you're just a part of.  It's not full of monsters waiting for you to show up.  Bandits, wolves, zombies, soldiers, peasants and other mercenary companies are all doing things that make sense that often have nothing to do with you.  I love that in a game, and it's rare.

In the end of battle stats I saw that the man survived the battle, He had his ear cut clean(or not) off and now wears a patch over his ear to hide the disgusting hole. A few battles later Another man lost an eye and wears an eye patch. I also like to hire Cripples, they are cheap and sometimes you get a good one that turns into a fierce warrior. This was on Beginner mode. I have been starting games in Veteran mode now but surviving past about 15 days has been impossible for me so far.

90,50117052,english,"Overall this game is average at best. Reasons.

Battle mechanics. 
While engaging they are far to random. This can result in a level 1 hitting ten times in a row, while a level 8 misses ten times in a row. Enemies get critical hits way to easily whereas you get none and are forced to slog your way through combat. Armour while important has no durability, a 140hp suit is often destroyed with a single blow whereas you are forced to batter your way through inch by inch. An example is where I surrounded an enemy and battered away missing or getting shield hits for over 10 turns before finally taking him down.

Your archers are rubbish whereas the AI can shoot you anywhere within range and hit 60 to 70%. You are lucky to gt 10%.

The AI is too predictable. It will always target any archers first. Ignoring all your other soldiers. If no archers then will charge the line head on.

Your troop placement is too limited. Stuck to only two lines. Despite having 20 troops you can never deploy more than twelve whereas the enemies are unlimited.

Nine times out of ten the terrain will be to your disadvantage even when you start combat. Stuck in the middle of a swamp, bottom of a hill, Enemy with trees for cover.

Storyline.
Pretty much there is none. Your only real aim is to build up your company to as strong as you can before the end game and that is it.

Equipment.
Armour and weapons too limited. You will have the best of everything by the middle of the game so nothing worth chasing after.

Also the loyalty to your employer plays a decent role. I made a choice in one mission that cost me my contract. I made a choice to betray my employer on another mission and made out like a bandit.

96,50032844,english,"Below is my previous review. I'm leaving it there to show that a bad RNG experience can totally ruin this game. However, having tried again I had a much better time when my soldiers actually landed a lot of their hits. I would even say I was very lucky the next time round since I kept landing 40-50% chance shots. 

So with that in mind I'd recommend all new players to cheese the starting part of the game by equipping literally every one of your melee guys with spears (militia spears are the cheap but good ones) and shields. Then have your ranged guys use throwing spears since they have a whopping +30% to hit chance. Just make sure to throw them from 2 tiles since they lose 10% hit chance per tile. 
Also another good piece of advice I got was to not get so hung up on guys dying. Your starting guys are rubbish because you recruit them for cheap money, so as you get later into the game you'll want to replace them with ex-soldiers, ex-nobles, hunters, hedge knights, etc. The high cost units. Plus, they don't always die. Sometimes they just get a random permanent debuff. So far they've not been too bad for my guys. A guy lost two sight but he was a melee character so it didn't matter and another lost 50% ranged damage, but again he was a melee character. I did have one that lost 20% initiative but that's not too bad either. Sometimes acting last can even be tactically benefitial. 

I would definitely advise everyone to ignore the iron man mode. As I said, bad luck can really ruin your game. So restarting a fight that you were really unlucky in is fine. 

When you get into the mid game your guys start dying less and you can start actually building up their levels. 


Old review:
""Game is a strategy based version of Mount and Blade. 

It would be excellent but for some reason the combat is terrible. Maybe I was just incredibly, consistently unlucky but I doubt that because I was missing lots of 80-90% chance hit in a row in every battle while the enemies would consistently hit my guys most times. Toward the end of my time playing recently I missed four 75% chance attacks in a row followed immediately by missing two 50% chance attacks. So basically my whole team missed with good or reasonable odds of hitting the enemy. Personally I think there's something wrong with the chance calculations, but hey, as I said maybe I was just really unlucky. 

Ultimately I want to like this game but a game based on strategy that can be so easily ruined by random chance isn't a fun game to play. You can have the perfect strategy but if your team constantly misses and the enemy constantly lands it's hits then you can simply never win.""",1554739431,1554920054,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198064878407,785,37,3626,0,2512,1600374264,,

Hopefully i can present this in an entertaining way, guess we, who play this game, share some common experience (ever being one ""x-bolted""?!), clearing stating that i am anything like an expert, let's simply say i have some practice & experience.


Starting with a little story about my 1st Goblin City Encounter (these are by far the most hated mob for most players, I tend to start to like them),

- BB small tech stuff
- what it is all about BB
- combat system, a turn based tactical RPG in a low medieval fantasy world
- some BB issues like: no introduction/too hard/RNG(luck)/Mods etc. 
- a short look at the DLC and the changes, weapons  and enemies (+ short tips) 
- a once OP ""solo-build"", which most limiting factor was weapon durability & enemies 5%, still fun, playstyle
- a little gift & thank you

BB will refer to ""Battle Brothers"".

Actually, and shame on me, I am around the corner in HH, didn't notice this until there were some rumors of a DLC, only knew that development has stopped, so i started to get interrested.

A little Thanky you from my side for a lot of fun I had playing BATTLEBROTHERS

Wow, that is some impressive playtime right there! We know of a couple of 4 digit hour players but they are not even close to you :)

1,32649365,english,"Gather ye all, for this be a story to tell. A story 'bout battles, a story 'bout fame. A story 'bout brothers and glory and dames.

And watching your favourite mercenaries get murder-killed by goblins, over and over again.

Actually, it's a story mainly about that.

So, provided your attention hasn't already wandered, here's the deal with Battle Brothers: It's a great game. Give the Devs your money. Go do it now. You have time to read the review later. YOU WILL HAVE TIME FOR REGRETS LATER MY FRIEND.

Because yeah, it's an amazing game but when you look at the content that was cut for the sake of time and expediency you will come to realise that this game could have been one of the all time greats with just another couple of months of development. And by a couple I mean, maybe 10 or so. But hey! Battle Brothers is by no means a quick cash grab scam by the developers; The finished product is thouroghly enjoyable and will provide many hours of joyful mercenary murder for fun and/or profit, There are just a few things that are missing from the road map (Camp followers, Battle specific locations) that I feel should have been implemented by release.

Ah well. So what is the final product like then?

Battle Brothers is a really pretty game that when played on anything other than easy offers a challenging and somewhat unforgiving experience as you take a band of starving thugs and outcasts and shape them into a fearsome fighting force ready to wreak bloody slaughter to whoever has the right coin.

Well, except that you need to come to turns with the fact that the ragtag group of misfits and vagabonds are all expandable and that you are in fact not levelling up a bunch of farmers and beggars until they all become Divine Slayers of Beasts and Men. Instead you are cynically using them to collate enough money to eventually replace aforementioned filth with actual capable fighters. 

And yes, maybe one or two lucky, talented or just plain unkillable cretins might outlive your expectations and become truly great warriors towards the end. Thats the kind of stories that make the game so enjoyable for me. Sadly these are the exceptions to the rule and you need to accept the fact that this game really is not for the sentimental. If you are planning on surviving in the long run you need to replace the enthusiastic but useless with the pragmatic and bloodied. Even Sven the Scarred, the refugee I picked up for almost nothing who had served me well in almost 40 battles with his astonishing ability to hide behind a shield and ineffectually poke at the shins of his opponents with his trusty poking spear, will have to eventually be replaced by Ragnar the Brickface because Ragnar is an unstoppable murder machine and for me that's a really easy arithmetic right there. So bye Sven, thanks for all the beatings you took and don't forget to leave your belongings at the door.

At the end of the day, this game is hard work though. Your band of mercs will slog and march all around the map, fighting and dying for a pittance. More often than not you will run out of food, run out of money and above all run out of patience as your battle hardened favourite crossbowman get shot through the eye by some sneaky bastard on a hill whilst your overpriced Hedgeknight Champion is flailing ineffectually against some enemy he should have killed 2 turns ago. Oh, he's running away now? Ah great, yeah, that's fine. Just stab him in the back as he's fleeing. Thanks. I spent two months savings on this guy, and another month's just for his armour and... yeah. Now he's dead. great, just fucking great. You are fucking useless Ragnar, you are utterly fucking useless. Yeah, I should have kept Sven shouldn't I? At least he didn't flee as soon as some poxy little gobshites started stabbing him in the face did he? So fuck this game, fuck RNG, fuck everything except my own decision to not put any points in Ragnar's resolve or for giving him a two handed axe cos it looked dope as fuck rather than a sword and shield until he had levelled up a level or three. Fuck the devs for making such a difficult game, fuck the unfairness of the enemies, fuck everything except my own positioning and tactics or my inability to fall back in the face of a superior enemy in order to live to fight another fucking day.

Erm...

Yeah but seriously, it's a great game but I understand that it might not be everyones cup of tea. Get it on a sale if you are into Turn based combat games or if you enjoy non-linear RPG's.

Had the devs been able to implement a couple of more features from the road map I would have said buy it at full price but alas this is not the case.

Battle brothers: you lead a company of mercenaries, each has its own attributes and background (and all are expendable), you have to trade and do missions around the map to gain gold and buy better equipment and more mercenaries. It is a strategy per turns game with resource managment.

Story 9 Great
The game is made to be a sandbox type, each run different, with different start, companions, map, etcetera. Is settled in world resembling middle ages in a zone with germans, rus and vikings. There are of course orks, goblins and undeads.

Graphics 10 Perfect
Everything is handmade, each armor and weapon have its own art, you can customize the look of your mercenaries, beards, hairstyle, tattoes, body type. Overall its style is unique and great.

Gameplay 8.5 Very Good
As a sandbox relies much on randomity and replayability, each map has its pros and cons, some have better trade routes, some have better settlement types. That a side, its and turn strategy game, you have to plan carefully where to move your troops in the battlefield, when to use certain weapons or armours, when to charge and when to hold the line. 

It eventually becomes repetitive, because to progress you need gold, in order to get it you can: trade or acept contracts, depending on the difficulty is the gold of the contract, but the dificulty always evolves with the player level.

There are 3 mayor crisis: Undead crisis, Noble war and Ork Invasion, each one has its own flavour as the enemies. To my liking some enemies are way to strong, if you like the challenge can increase the dificulty.

But no.....Gods no...All the sudden you get ambushed and ya lose two men because there like ""Nope i'm done"" pretty much. The feeling of dread with each contract compels you to see what may unfold. This game is a love and hate relationship because you do rely on everything that you earn. There is nobody holding your hand even if you choose the beginner route. Battle Brothers will most certainly cradle you into a maelstrom of emotions.

But it has grown on me over the year. I play this nearly everyday and ponder how I haven't gone insane by the amount of brainpower I put into it with each battle and each gold coin spent and each tool thrown upon my battle brothers torn garments.

(updated since my previous early access review)
Pros:

- Simple and intuitive turn-based combat.
- The connection with your company of mercenaries will most likely have you strangling your keyboard when you see one of them falter.
- A beautiful ever changing world with a variety of things to turn into a hellish landscape. The End crises that may play out which only make your companies life much harder, but the rewards much greater.
- Many builds you could possibly make with your soldiers, Many perks and other talents and niches from their backgrounds.
- The Developers have been very very in tune with the community since early access and the DLC's they put out are outstanding. They really do enrich the world with more weaponry and more foul creatures to defeat and make a profit!
- There is a modding community brewing behind this game, even though the developers couldn't spare their resources to rework a modding capability into the main game. Luckily, passionate fans have been poking at it here and there. I shall specifically mention the ""Legends Mod"" which certainly expands this game to new heights with it's new heroes and weaponry, Alternate starts and much more in the future.
- Great artwork and simplistic soundtrack with it's moments.


Cons:

- This game may be a little overwhelming for someone not used to the sheer grind of managing a group of regular human beings in a low-fantasy realm where everything is quite terrifying and you could die in a mere flash. Orcs, Goblins, Dire-wolves, Juggernaut-like brigands and their skilled marksmen are merely the least of your worries. 

- It can be rather dull at times, Some of your battle brothers will be just cannonfodder. You may rage here and there. But in that regard, that only means that this game has truly pulled you in which will usually make you want to throw yourself onward for the long haul!

- Some of the actions you may experience during battle's in particular will make you questionable. ""How did I miss when I had a 80% chance to hit him in the open with no other factors in my way"" You'll miss plenty of key shots, plenty of failed swinging of axes and blades but hopefully you're a good teacher and your battle brethren will prevail given enough failure. Patience will be required.

This is a simply outstanding game. It continues to grow into much more with the new DLC's and with the stirring mod community. You must give this a chance if you like party-type management or if you like leading a band of peasants to their deaths, maybe during a sale of course.",1466590879,1552192512,True,2,0,0.4800853431224823,1,True,False,False,76561198163251877,422,13,11898,3,161,1601750557,,
30,49437137,english,"I've never seen a game do a gritty low-magic fantasy setting this well. Everything about the world, and the mechanics, is practical, to the point that what actual magic there is feels quite deliberately out of place. Going up against even a minor necromancer is cause for your imaginary mercenary leader to sigh heavily and grit his teeth, because it really is some bull shit.

There's a lot here that interests me; there was clearly an attempt to design the game with a heavy focus on immersing the player in the experience of their profession rather than on creating highly massaged tactical experiences, and as an idea I love that. It just takes it all a bit too far for me to follow.

There isn't really a lot of variance in what the game throws at you. Orcs and goblins and undead and bandits and peasant mobs all feel a bit different to fight, but not as much as you might expect. Specializing a squad also takes a long time, and maintaining any individual trained mercenary requires plenty of money, so it's not really feasible to adjust your composition for a single contract. So there's not much variance in what your opponent is doing, and almost none in how you're responding. In the long term, there's about 1.5 viable builds for your squad of Battle Brothers, with only small adjustments for different enemy types. And unfortunately they're particularly boring ones to play out.

The game is also unfair. You can be attentive, and cautious, and know exactly what you're getting into and still, with some regularity, exit a contract much poorer than you entered it. This is a good thing, it contributes in a vital way to the lovely setting and tone of the game. But it is still hard to stomach, because the cost of misfortune is much more dire than it needs to be to serve that purpose, and because a lot of the unfairness felt strictly unintentional. For example, a fully grown nachzehrer's devour ability should probably allow some kind of save, especially since some encounters allow multiple fully grown nachzehrers to spawn from the get go.

It doesn't care if you've lost 90 percent of your party, it'll still throw at you countless and overpowered monsters like Alps just so you could rage behind your monitor screen and smash your forehead against the keyboard. I bet the developers were having a laugh when they created this game. It is ridiculously hard, even on beginner difficulty. Do not even think about starting an Ironman playthrough, because the only way to beat this game is to savescum the shit out of it unless you want to lose 20hrs of progress and start all over again. Do not get me wrong, I love a challenge and losing is part of the fun but this is just absurdly tough. Make sure to go online and find a good map seed because again, RNG plays a major factor in your success. You have to find a good balance of towns with certain resources so you could trade and not spend the whole game barely feeding and paying your party.  Is it fun? Yes, but it becomes more of a chore after the first half a dozen tries. 

You cannot interact with passing caravans or parties in the open world like you could with Mount & Blade, for example. They're just there decoratively, serve no purpose whatsoever. If an enemy party is chasing you, in this case a monster group, they will completely ignore other human parties even if they pass right by them, this greatly breaks the immersion and feels like you're not a part of the world. 

If you somehow manage to survive early/mid game and get metal armour, funnily enough the game gets incredibly easy, you begin to win every battle with no scratch until you get a really shitty RNG roll and your whole party is obliterated. This could be fixed by the community through mods, but guess what, there is no workshop support, I do not know if this is on the agenda but it could solve balance and increase replayability through various mods.

In short, there's a whole lot of balancing to do and gameplay mechanics to be added if, in my eye, Battle Brothers is to be a top-notch Turn-based Strategy RPG. For now, I cannot recommend it.

It's truly a masterpiece and i'll be playing it for quite some time on and off.  
  
Pros:
- Medieval Turn-Based Strategy Game where you lead a group of mercs and they level up, become stronger and can be equipped with various gear.
- Punishing experience for the people that love this.
- You might fight often same type of enemies but fights never go the same way.  
- Music is ok.  
- Gruesome injuries, but this is how it was back in the days.   
- Unique items you can get from Leaders and raiding structures that are controlled by strong enemies.
- Huge map with alot of unexplored area that contains many interesting structures to raid for dem sweets.  
- Roleplay possibilities.
- Achievments.
- Replayability.
- Mercs you hire with their own backstory perks and personalities to get attached to and see as they grow into good mercs.
- Recently the Devs started pushing new content despite saying that they are done. Stuff like new enemies, new items, new starting lore which impacts your game. Yes Yes YES!
- The game has also been opened up for modding so the possibilities are endless.

Cons:
- Heavy RNG like XCOM. Ya know the meme 99% chance to hit.. misses. Well it's not as bad but you can see many salty people in the review section.  
- Not a noob friendly experience. There really isnt any tutorial to help you out, it's a difficult game just like any strategy game is. If you are not willing to try try lose lose and learn you are gonna have hell of a salty time and end up writinig a negative review.  
- No Multiplayer.
- Graphics.. maybe? I personally love it.

For me this game is hell of a fun and i'm the type that enjoys the punishing aspect very much. I often even prefer to play only the early game where it's difficult and don't mind losing. If you ain't the type that is ready to lose and restart then you're gonna have some rage problems.

PRO:
Highly enjoyable and challenging open world game with similar to Mount and Blade, except with individual 'chess-like' pieces representing your party.  There is a wide variety of weapons and quests, and a random seed map that changes every time you start a game.  The goal is to level up your party of mercenaries while earning gold for finishing quests and other tasks.   There are numerous skills, backgrounds, and perks available.  

CONS:
Make sure you have 1.2 version and do not use the beta 1.1xx.  There are some issues with the DLC that cause lockups and crashes.  That solved a lot of errors that I was encountering.  

- Still experiencing some freezing when trying to enter towns.  Its random and it seems to go away after a few minutes.  It is 'fixed' when I save then reload.
- Some balance issues with some of the monsters in the Beast DLC.  
- Some of the quests are impossible to win early on.  I was running into large numbers of brigand raiders and other hard creatures right after fighting Hoggart (the first quest).

The first time I changed my opinion about a game but I feel Battle brothers deserves some more credit. After playing and practising a bit more this game can grow on you. Now with more DLC in the making that flesh out the RP part a bit more, this game has a promise to be great. Within the turn based franchise this game became one of its current day pioneers. There is still enough to dislike about the RNG system and the stale presentation of the world map. But the battle system and character progression are strong features that keep me drawing back in.


Initial Review, Not recommended.
The game is okay. But I grew a bit tired of it a bit too soon. I watch my merc band slide over the campaign map and wonder what the hell I should do. Oh yeah contracts, I should earn money. Take contract and travel to some far off town. And there they slide again. Slideing... slide... oh this map looks stale.. why is everything so stale? 

Poof! combat. Ok the fun part, this game is all about combat. There is my hero Bjorn with his big two handed axe, go for it man! Chunk.. Bjorn is severly injured by a bolt, argh! The rest of the low life in my band tried to win the battle and actually managed to do so. But it was too late for Bjorn, the poor lad died by a bolt shot by a bandit with no motives on a stale map. The rest of the party felt depressed by Bjorns passing and slided unwillingly over the map afterwards... 

Morale of the story, without lore or any background in this gameworld, its just a random map with random battles and gives hardly motivation to play or see the game through. Thea the awakening did a better job on that, imo.",1504020769,1550596010,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198007388328,222,44,4505,0,3645,1558122341,,

You will gain valuable armour's & weapons which make your band look like the business end of Dirty Harry's revolver. And sure enough they will become shiny corpse packaging's and burial trinkets in the very next fight.

You can slog through the campaign with the added anger option of ironman (because your a man! and FU RNG!) so your F4 key will inevitably be shinier than the others. Eventually you end up with a party of lame, alcoholics with severe psychosis hobbling about the map as tattered tramps living hand to mouth and hoping to have some 'strange meat' in their inventory and coin to pay a portion of some wage which you manage to eek out thanks to that loyalty buff.

BUT:

Victory is so very sweet when you shove your tramps into battle and clash with multiple opponents in one fight to gain advantage on quests and come out with not a scratch.

That said, this game is incredibly difficult. I've only just started and thus am playing on beginner difficulty, yet I still find myself outgeared and outclassed very often. So, if you have very little frustration tolerance, you should probably stay away from this, as it definitely has a quite steep learning curve and is quite unforgiving. Picking the wrong fights or getting a bro out of position will almost always lead to the death of at least one of your dudes. Reading guides is also something you should definitely do, if you're starting out, as there are lots of game mechanics and things that are not explained in the game and can otherwise only be figured out by trial and error (and errors tend to be costly in this one :) )

Nevertheless, I still find it enjoyable, even though I have one of these low frustration tolerances. The game is incredibly addictive and you always want to complete one more contract and one more fight.

I'm glad I picked it up, because I really like its approach.  Other reviewers has compared this game to Mount & Blade, another game I enjoyed, and I too think that's a legitimate comparison.  It's a bit like Mount & Blade meets turn-based gameplay.

What I like best about Battle Brothers is every fight needs your attention.  Even when you outnumber an enemy squad and it's a guaranteed win, some plucky bandit might score a critical on your best tank and really put a wrench on your playthrough, so you always need to be on your toes.  If you're diligent in other games like XCOM, Fire Emblem, Wasteland, etc. you can beef up squad members to a near unkillable status and rush them into the fight.  Not so in Battle Brothers, even your best armored beefcake can crumble if not used correctly.  This also works against the game, as it can feel exhausting having cautiously manage the details of every fight.  Whenever I sit down for longer sessions, I inevitably get a bit tired of the fights and get more prone to making mistakes because I'm not being attentive enough, and lead to some frustrating losses.  This means it's better to take breaks from the game so you don't get burnt out.  

I also really like managing the member's of your mercenary group.  It's up to you the figure out the best use for each recruit you take on.  There are no class restrictions, every recruit can fill whatever role you choose for them, but their variable stats and traits make them better suited for one roll over another.  Each mercenary also gains experience from fights and you pick out different perks for them as they progress, so you can better specialize them into different roles.  You'll also encounter different types of enemies, so certain tactics and loadouts are more effective depending on who you're fighting.

One thing I think is missing is the ability to stay at an inn or something in towns to keep safe from the baddies, just like Mount & Blade does.  It stinks to have a group of tougher enemies pop up and having no way to outrun them and then have to watch your squad die.  Also, as is the case with most games of this type, you have to be okay with unlucky RNG results.  A way Battle Brother kind of compensates is having large squad sizes and the ability to have reserves troops.  A character or two dying is completely recoverable, even if it's your best equipped member.  You just have to get over that grieving period of losing another brother who you have been through so many battles with to another stupid goblin archer.

I actually broke my own rule of not using torrents to play this game because the response amongst friends was bi-polar and I wanted to see which group was right. So in truth I have played it for well over 100 hours and could not, in good concience, NOT buy it.
The fact that I have done even though I could have continued to play it for free should tell you something.

Imagine a less politically involved version of Mount and Blade with tactical turn based combat instead of real-time third/first person and that is pretty much what you have.
Ignore the cries of too much RNG. It's tactical and if you use focussed tactics both in building and using your units then the RNG is not obtrusive at all. This said, it's a difficult game with a fairly steep learning curve which makes it understandable that many would put their feeble tactics being crushed down to bad rolls. This is a game you will want to keep on beginner level for quite some time before moving on. In fact I myself hated Battle Brothers for a fair while before it captured me.

*no longer true/ see edit* The only criticism I have is that by late game everything can become a bit samey especially after several playthroughs.

It remains an eminently worthy buy on the rare occasions it is on sale. Is it worth its full price? Well that depends more on you than the game itself.

*edit* 29/01/2019: The new expansion is something that doesn't make its true worth evident until you play for a fair number of game days but the inclusion of being able to craft mods out of killed creature body parts is fairly minor compared to the massive improvements represented by now having many types of enemy that attack in weird and wonderful ways and the huge ammount of new and interesting events that really add that bit extra that make new playthroughs more unique. Despite having the same core mechanic BB, with its expansions, is so much improved over vanilla that it more than doubles the quality and value of the game as something which, like chess, will never get old.

This is a game you have to start out on easy for the first run. There's no real tutorial, so a lot of mechanics are uncovered through intuition and guesswork. (there's also steam forums but I'd stay away from those) Normal isn't that bad of a jump, but at this stage you'll start to wipe more often in the first 20ish hours. After being persuaded that anything below the highest difficulty is a waste of my time, I ventured out into the unknown with a company named, ""Battle Boars"" cuz I'm too lazy to backspace the default name the game gives you.


Then I wiped. And wiped. And wiped. Consitently around 10, then 20, then 60, then a bug locked me out on 72, and now my current company is living paycheck to paycheck on day 110. (all of this is on ironman btw, don't do ironman. Ever.) 

Moral of the story is: prepare to Wipe. Don't get attatched to anyone or anything early-mid game. Keep your chin up and power through goblin ambushes on day 12 caravan. Shake your head and grit your teeth as you experience the Wipe when meeting hexen for the first time. Cry as the A L P experiences you. Unholds... are actually a fun enemy. 

Got ya. 

Anyways, this is a great game that actively refuses to hold your hand, to the point where you have to scour the forums for help. And blessed be the pilgrim who ventures into the forums. You'll need it.

20,48494089,english,"[h1] One of my favorite games of all time, Battle Brothers is a tactical open world turn based RPG experience that brings the likes of games such as Mount and Blade, Fire Emblem, and XCOM together in order to create a fun, challenging, and grindy experience that is all worth each and every single hour or even second you put into this game. [/h1]

So what do you do in Battle Brothers?

You start off as a mercenary leader in a random procedurely generated fantasy land, who has just lost all but the last three troops of his mercenary company during a contract. After that it is up to you on recreating and restablishing your company from the ashes it once was, into a company that they will talk about for the ages. But to do this however, it will require gold to pay for mercenaries who's backgrounds range from farmers, beggars, witchunters, and even--eunuchs.

Once you buy the mercs who are supposed to be the future face of your company, now it is time to buy their equipment, maintain their equipment, buy food so they don't starve, pay their wages, keep them in line from breaking the company apart with random events having to do with in party fighting, find contracts that will pay accordingly and---Oh yeah, i haven't even gotten to even the combat yet.

Before you do start to begin the struggle of maintaining a mercenary company with all those things i had just talked about, you need to keep them alive in order to level them up and be able to improve their stats and give them perks that will improve their chances of living in fights by only a few fractions of percentages. The thing with Battle Brothers though however, is anything will ALWAYS have the chance to kill you at ANY possible stage in the game. Nothing in this game is something you can sleep on (Aside from maybe Bandit Thugs late game). 

Everything from Brigand Raiders, Brigand Marksman, Orcs, Goblins, Undead, Direwolves, Nachzehrers (A type of cannibal zombie beast thing), Swordmasters, Master Archers, Knights, HEDGE Knights--and trust me this isn't even scratching the surface of the amount of variation of these enemies have with different weapons, armor, and enemy combinations that they can all attack you with. And it doesn't help either that the combat system is one that no matter how high the percentage is to hit that enemy (With the lowest hit chance being 5% and the highest being 95%) still doesn't guarantee an easy fight as you WILL miss even with a 95% hit chance.

And if that doesn't kill you by then, your party's morale may play a factor as if one of your guys is even the slightest scared after watching the brother on his side either take a critical hit or die, his stats will fall the ground and he will run away without your command. Or if even not that, then maybe it'll be a war with noble houses that get to your men, or a orc and goblin invasion? Nah, maybe an invasion of zombies and ancient undead soliders, who will be paired with a Necromancer for the fun of you killing zombies only for them to be revived.

Now that i've said my piece on everything being able to kill you, including the much complained about RNG.

I love this game.

The gameplay in this game goes much deeper then what many, including my friends (Who have laughed quite a bit at me for preaching about how fun this game is >:C ) can aspire to think it does. This game doesn't have a story that is built off you being the Dragonborn or some revolutionary hero who is sent by the gods to cleanse the darkness of the world. No. Battle Brothers is a story that you will tell both throughout the beginning and end of their journey. 

The world, the combat, the enemies, and the struggle of your party being an average human party of farmers and daytellers who are looking to change their lives around with maybe one big breakthrough contract, is all one that tells a story itself. No matter the difficulty and no matter the situation, Battle Brothers doesn't hold your hand and teach you what you need to do, because the game wants you to play of your instinct and ambitions of what you think is good for your men and not what some fancy script and story based RPG that will control the destiny of you and your companions.

[h1] I give the game a 9/10, with the only reason its not a 10/10 is just for the fact the game is quite pricey but MORE than worth it. [/h1]",1548188143,1548193290,True,27,2,0.75126802921295166,0,True,False,False,76561198081867672,204,9,13869,0,13531,1570648997,,

23,48482506,english,"This is a quality RNG tactical rogue-like game. At the beginning, you will command a misfit band of farmers, millers, cultists (my favorite), and many other non-combat professions, with a core of 3 companions. Hopefully in the slaughter of the early game, the weak will by culled and the strong will grow in skill and discipline. That said somehow the club-footed monk that you wrecklessly throw in harms way will survive, while the near perfect stat champion will be felled by a single stray arrow meant for said club-footed monk. Yes, you will need to get use to frustration and things going horribly wrong when they should have gone easily right. If you enjoy the excitement and, frankly, stress of needing to make the most of a bad situation, this is the game for you. 

There are also wonderful mini-rpg elements that add depth. Your brothers will have random events thrown at them that flavor the experience. Your historian can ""educate"" a dump brother. Your monk can help your flagellant to love god(s) (not clear what religion we have here) without flaying himself. And that cultist I mentioned before, he can convert your other brothers to the cult... and much, much more that I won't spoil. Let's just say it's sufficiently culty. 

That said, this isn't an RPG, and isn't going to deliver much of a story. All reputations are a very basic slider system that doesn't remember any specific things your company did or did not do. The above mentioned interactions are intrigueing, but they only last briefly and very few are revisited later. Very surprisingly, your brothers never even seem to remember their fallen comrades (other than a basic slider morale system), their own legendary deeds, or a particularly great victory they had, a really missed opportunity in my opinion. What I'm trying to say here is, you need to have your own imagination to keep the ""story"" of you company alive in your mind. The game is not going to do that for you. 

There are a few problems with the system of the base game (not considering expansion here, as it needs it's own review). Enemies and many fights are all very similar. It's a lot of killing raiders, other mercs/houses, undead, and orcs. There are nuisances and different strategies with all the main enemy types, but with the huge grind (more on this) almost every battle type becomes repetitive and boring. And yes, there is a grind. Initially your brothers will level in about 1 to 2 fights. This becomes nearly 10-15 fights towards the end game (10+). This is true even when fighting the end game fights, which award a trivial amount more exp than early fights when considering the massive difficulty increase and risk. From an exp perspective, it is far safer and more cost effective to farm low level encounters. More, you need huge sums of wealth to afford the end game gear. There are exploits, perhaps working as intended, with trade routes, but it's still a slog to fully equip your team. You CAN get the exact items weilded, worn, or carrrid by your fallen foes, assuming you don't destory them in the process of winning, a very cool feature. This helps with the need to farm gold. That said, with better armed foes comes a great deal more risk and a lot more dead brothers, whose replacements you'll need to farm back up in levels. And let me say, a level one brother in endgame gear dies extremely fast and is almost useless, as he'll almost never have the fatigue to use the items equipped.

If you like tactical rogue-like games, you will most likely be able to soak a few hundred hours into this. If you hate grinds and RNG systems, stay away.

24,47284506,english,"Battle Brothers is... Mount & Blade overworld (on a hex grid; without you being able to control territory), with X-Com tactical combat (on a hex grid; and fantasy). In theme it's... Game of Thrones (but focused on the low folk) plus The Black Company (but of course) plus Blood Meridian (but fantasy). It's a very good game and I really like it. It's just sort of tragic that their budget was so clearly incredibly tight, as, due to that, I don't know if I can say it's a [i]great[/i] game and that I [i]love[/i] it.

The least-important consequence of this to me is that there is next to no animation. Excellent sound design helps make you not feel its lack much, but doesn't mitigate it entirely. Also, on the sound design: [i]wow,[/i] the death gurgles are phenomenal and disturbing. Though I would say that the orchestral soundtrack does not fit the mood of the game well, at least in the early- to mid-game. It's far too epic for a posse of farmers with spears and hatchets chasing down some robbers who stole some country alderman's coin collection. And it's just too... typical. I might have loved to hear some Spaghetti Western inspired music, perhaps. Something lonely and simpler. Or just smaller-scale folk music. Some pipes and a fiddle and a hand drum. That would just fit better. And they do have folk music themes to it with a rustic-sounding fiddle playing a melody for bits, but then a whole classical string section comes in behind it and takes over, kinda ruining the gritty, low fantasy feel, to my mind.

Next up, there's the fact that you can't hire women. Now, this is clearly a patriarchal medieval-stye society, in which women don't really learn to fight as a rule. Fine. But you can hire cripples with broken backs and crutches and certainly don't give two poops about societal norms, so this makes no sense. Especially when you can redesign and rename troops, and often a big draw in these games is making yourself and your friends. And swiftly getting you and them killed. And a mod has in fact made “Battle Sisters”, using Overhype's own concept designs for pawns. There can't really be much more to making it work except a search and replace in the game's text to check pronouns.

Which brings us to my next point: modding. The game is a wonderful base, but being able to improve on it would be [i]amazing.[/i] Sadly, there isn't any modding support, so making mods is quite an undertaking and they have to be manually updated (which is also quite an undertaking) with each new game version.

It's not that modding support is [i]expected,[/i] but it would be [i]so great[/i] for this game. Because my biggest issue with it is its tragic lack of scope, and that would mitigate it. The core gameplay is compelling, but fairly limited. You fight on open hex maps with no buildings or anything, even when you're going to a crypt or tomb or fortress, and the mission variety is very limited. I saw the same bits of dialogue repeated quite a few times in just the first few hours of play, for the same four mission types in over 20 hours of play: guard the caravan, track the enemy using their footprints, find the location, or go to the marked location and kill the enemy. More variety in mission types and more twists in the missions would be wonderful.

In addition, they have mechanics for simulating what's going on in settlements. Whether or not they're well-supplied, based on if caravans are making it there; how terrorized the villagers are; even whether buildings on the outskirts are being destroyed. All this would lend itself [i]super[/i] well to a base-building system, and I hope that DLC is coming [i]so[/i] much. But it would be nice if I could add it myself with mod support since I sort of doubt it is.

There are [i]so[/i] many mods I want to exist for this game. More backstories, more traits, more perks, more terrain types and objects on the battle map, more items; more everything. Because the game is very good. I just want more of it. [i]So much.[/i] So yes, it's a very good game, but a bit steep in price for the scope, and it just makes me want [i]more.[/i] I can feel its lacks quite keenly, almost constantly, and that hurts my enjoyment.

Oh, and I would also say that, especially as the game costs so much, the developers putting multiple items behind ""support the developers"" DLC is not a good business practice, in my opinion. Anything that is essentially begging in the form of DLC just seems unprofessional to me. Have a Patreon or a donate button on your site, fine. But if you're selling something on a storefront, it's by definition a product, and therefor open to criticism and should be worth the asking price. That's just how I look at it. So the fact that they're effectively asking $10 for a banner and for a helm bothers me. And even if they were asking $1, I'd want them to put it in a proper DLC rather than cluttering things up with microtransactions (though I'd mind it much less).

27,38588682,english,"TLDR: I will give this game a Thumbs Up once the developer includes a character editor.

REASONING:  I do not recommend this game without a character editor, because it is too difficult for casual gamers like me who don't want to spend endless time hiring random characters for the sole purpose of using them as human shields/fodder.  It's just lame that way, which is the only way.  A character editor would enable the player to enjoy their teams more, the game more, and appreciate battles more.  Further modding could make battles easier, as there is no ""Easy Mode.""

As it sits right now, the developer made a game for you to die in.  I don't understand why there is a market for that; it seems the opposite of playing a game.  But that's just my opinion.  Nevertheless, if you don't like your party wiping or losing characters that you care about (because there is nothing you can do to save them about 80% of the time), then this game will only frustrate you and you will want your money back, like I do.

Even if you like taking your weak sauce characters (and few good ones) out to die (the strategy guides for this game are good, but even they acknowledge that you will lose the vast majority of your dudes over time), then this game is not worth $15 as a complete edition.  For what it offers, it's a $10 complete version game.

If it had a character editor, then I would recommend it for its mechanics, style, strategy, and concepts; and $20 for a complete version would be fair.  But without the character editor, I advise you to stay away from Battle Brothers.  It just gets boring after a while when you can't do anything because everyone is dead and you have no money, which happens sooner or later.

Not fun.  Needs a character editor.",1514051758,1547841667,False,2,0,0.451901406049728394,0,True,False,False,76561198040642365,222,34,1708,0,1708,1517038125,,

29,39637690,english,"Started up a new campaign when I saw there had been a major update and decided to start it up from scratch. I hadn't touched the game for a few months and after a couple of days of playing it I remembered why I stopped. The combat system is very nuanced but easy to grasp. I feel like a lot of that nuance goes to waste, though, on account of overtuned difficulty. (even on the easiest difficulty settings.) It really detracts from the fun of having several different ways to approach something when the game is so hard that anything other than absolutely optimal play is rewarded on the spot with a game over. There's a sandbox element to the gameplay, but the game is built to constantly increase the difficulty of the campaign as it gets longer, so every mistake you make has its cost compounded, too. It kind of feels like a bait and switch to make a system with so much potential for customized-feeling armies and interesting tactics and then bludgeon the player into approaching almost every single battle with the same boring shieldwall full of boring tanks with axes for removing enemy shields with a couple of big heavy weapons coming in on the flanks and one or two archers in the backline.  ""Git Gud"" is something that fans of hard games like to trot out, but when savescumming a battle for a 1% chance to generate a brigand leader with a unique weapon is an uncontroversial gameplay tip, something has gone wrong. 

Aside from the gameplay, nothing else about this game is impressive. There are a few pieces of splash art that are reused into the ground and the music is nice for a couple of hours but nothing special. The actual gameplay graphics are good enough that nothing takes you out of the flow, which is nice, but nothing is particularly amazing. Some people say the writing is high quality. I say that it's a few dozen pages of okay prose arranged randomly. This is not microfiction at its best, it's just microfiction at a level that isn't offensive. 

I kept playing this game for as long as I did because I was holding out hope that if I just got good enough at it, I'd start to have fun. Well, after grinding through enough of a crisis to figure out that resolving it was just going to be more of the same old thing, I don't think that anymore.

This game is very enjoyable and can give you a sense of pride and accomplishment through many ordeals such as killing large monsters, fending off hordes, or even just surviving day by day. It is not a friendly game if you do not micromanage and plan out for the future(especially the harder modes).  

The progression in this game can be very difficult such as spending money on recruitment, food, better equipment, upkeep for units, medicine, and tools. But as I said, this game does all this is a great and fun way. But I do rage time to time when my beastly brother falls and or RNG is not in my favor. Ironman mode is a must if you are a true brother or ""sister"". This is not an easy game. You will lose brothers, gold, equipment, and have shit RNG, but thats the core mechanic that makes it shine.

Like all games, this is not a perfect game and they can upgrade the experience such as replacing the start without the fucker named Hoggart. Also, I have experienced annoying bugs such as not being able to visit a town, but saving and quitting and restarting fixes it. But small stuff like that annoys and ruins the experience with such beastly music in the background.

The game mechanics could be awesome. Unfortunatelly is off  balanced—something that could be easily fixed if it was opened to the modding community.

Then, (b)  there are op characters (even in the first week of the game (necromancers) that every time you kill an enemy, he/she resurrects them.

I play video games since the Atari console times, and I see this game mechanics excelent but whomever is keeping the balance is smoking some weird thing. Like, I got a mission after my first guy upgraded, and I ran into a place with 12 guys that you kill and keep comming back—at this stage of the game you have no more than 6 bros.

57,48052013,english,"Good game. It has it's quirks and little annoyances but the overall experience is fun and enjoyable.
It's a game where you move your party in a randomly generated map, populated with towns, big and small, and with different nobble houses controling most of them, making the way of factions. It's a medieval setting with beasts, monsters, mages, orcs and gobblins. 
On game start, you can customize your experience a bit, deciding the difficulty of combat and economy separatly, and choose a specific end-game crysis.
You start the game by watching the last moments of the previous Commander of your mercenary company. Your company is cut down to 3 men, and you are appointed the new commander by your fellow mercenaries. From here on, you proceed to choose a name and a banner for your newly formed merc company and set out to get payed for the last job. There you'll have the chance to go after the weasel that killed your predecessor if you wish, or set out on your own right away.
At first nobody will know your merc band, and your feeble small team can barely handle the most basic contracts. But as you grow, contract new men, buy new equipment, find more loot, and gather experience from battle, slowly your Company will start to become better. Doing more profitable contracts, getting more recognition. You can get contracts in towns from the general populace, and later (after you become a little more known and trusted) from nobbles. Contracts can be straight forward as ""go there, kill these"", can be about patroling roads between towns for 7 days and get payed per head (bandit or monster), can be about finding a fabbled location for someone, can be about protecting a town and can also be about escorting a trade caravan, or to carry some package yourself. All of them can vary quite a bit in dificulty. 
World map is real-time (with pause and time acceleration available) and you can see the trade caravans , basic peasant groups, other merc companies, raiders or whatever move in the map same as you, as long as they are within visual distance for your men.   Everyone moving on the map leaves tracks that will vanish over time. Useful to track enemy targets. You can attack hostiles or be attacked by them at any time. But don't expect to be attacked by a weaker enemy. They may even lure you to chase them closer to their allies and then attack you. 
Combat is turn-based, and it's brutal. 
Combat start is actually one of my little annoyances with the game. Every few in-game weeks it's like the game decides to stack up all possible handicaps in one battle. You attack, but the game decides to tell you that you were attacked instead, and can't make out who your enemies are. It's literaly impossible not to loose men, going to the point of the combat opening with an enemy turn, that proceeds to use their 3 marksman on your one weaker man. There's nothing to indicate he's weaker. He's not injured. He's not less armored than the rest. It's literally only visible in the stats. (He has the worse ranged defense.) But somehow the 3 enemy marksmen all know it and they all shoot him dead on the first turn, before you can do a move. He wasn't even the best possible choice to shoot in terms of hit chance percentage. This is not an uncommon ocurrence. Worse, if you reload, you'll watch the game load a new map, a new rooster of enemies... and do exactly the same to kill your man. Or being about to start combat against goblin raiders (riding wolves). It's key not to get surrounded. If possible kill or injure them with ranged attacks. And never, ever allow them to gain height advantage on melee. But more often than not, combat with Goblin Raiders sees the game spawn a suposedly randomly generated map, but with strategically placed cliffs right behind the extremeties of your second line (archers and 2-handed long reach weapons). Of course, the wolf-riders will race to those ""pedestals"" behind your archers and wreck havoc from there.  It's annoying when you realize that even if you reload the battle every single time the map will be different, but will still have the same cliffs in the same place, forcing an hidden handicap against the player.  
So liitle AI cheats like this are annoying, specially if you are considering doing ironman runs on this.
Like I was saying, combat is turn-based and it's brutal. You can field a max of 12 men at once, each of those men can have pets (war dogs, falcons, etc). In combat your war dogs also enter the frey, but they are controlled by the AI. That means your combat party can even be 24 (12 men, 12 dogs for example), but you'll only be able to control the 12 men. 
You have melee and ranged weapons. Different classes of Bows, Crossbows, Hallberds, Pikes, Spears, several types of shields, several types of swords, hammers, axes, maces, morning stars, different types of 2-handed weapons,some for multi-hiting,some for longer reach, blunt weapons smash and daze, blade weapons bleed and decepate, pierce weapons bypass armors, different weapons from different races that you can loot. There is a A LOT of different weapons and equipments you can choose from, being sold at armorers, weaponsmiths and fletchers or simply looted after battles. 
 Each of your men will have an armor, helmet, 1 weapon slot for each arm, 2 more slots for trophies and attachments, and 2 slots for carrying combat inventory (upgradable to 4). The heavier the slower, both in the turn order, and in the dodge capabilities.  Tactically, combat is based around creating a first line of melee defenders, preferably with shields, and a second line with ranged attackers, or eventual 2-handed LR weapons, in order to sustain the first few turns while everyone is still low on Fatigue. Moving, attacking, defending and using skills, all have a cost in Fatigue. When fully Fatigued, characters can't take actions for one turn until they catch their breath. Each of your men has a wide range of stats for you to analise and decide what's the best equipment and skills for them, and they level up by gaining experience, allowing you to improve the stats manually and choose a skill  each time they do. During combat, everyone involved, enemies, friendlies and your own men have a confidence rate. Having your men dying can cause the survivors see their courage fail, good hits or kills will have the opposite effect, seeing them boost their moral and confidence. Same is true for NPCs. 
But combat is so brutal that you can easily loose your best merc in a couple of turns. Don't get too attached to your men, since loosing them is also  part of the process of improving your Merc Company. You can hire a merc with as little as 80 coins ( begger or crippled) in the first few days, when you desperatly need men and lack money, or as much as 3 or 4k coins (a noble knight). As you can imagine, their initial stats at level 1 will be very different.  By mid-game, the only way you'll get the money and recognition you need, is if you stop playing it safe and start doing better payed, riskier jobs. And those usually take a tool on your numbers. But that also opens the spot on your merc band, and with more money available than you had in the beginning of the game, chances are you'll hire a better man for the job. Still raw and rookie  at lvl 1 sure, but higher potential and probaly better stats already than the beggar you hired in your first week, that is now at lvl5+.
Difficulty keeps growing towards the end-game until you finally meet an end game crysis, that can be a miriad of things. From a greenskin invasion, to civil war between the nobbles, to a few other things in between. At that point, you'll find out if you built a Mercenary Company to stand against the tide, or a band of mongrels and vagabonds ready to fall and be forgotten. If you like turn-based combat, see a few videos of the gameplay to check if you would like the mechanics of combat. If it seems like it's something you might enjoy, don't hesitate. It's worth it.

70,47975173,english,"I have something of a love/hate relationship with this game. The specific genre is somewhat new for me, though I did come up on RPGs, Civ, more recently X-Com, and there is another game here on Steam (Braveland) which Battle Bros reminds me of a little bit (though Battle Bros is a LOT more brutal and unforgiving). I would say if you like any of those then Battle Brothers might be for you. 

Here's the thing: It's HARD. Granted, I'm a pretty casual gamer (read: I kinda suck and I'm okay with that). Even still, I think there probably aren't many who would be disappointed by the challenge of this game. There is a pretty steep learning curve. I thought I was doing great in my first game, then I got to around day 100 and realized I was woefully underequipped (money/equipment management is crucial) and had too many men who were green (I grew my party too quick, upping the difficulty of encounters prematurely and causing my guys to get wiped out repeatedly {save scum, sorry!}). 

So, I started again, and got to about day 180 and realized I had made another, different, series of early-game mistakes. I think I'm on about my 5th company, now, and I'm pretty sure I'm not going to get past about day 200 or so. The thing is I'm starting to be unsure what mistakes I'm making, or if some of my underlying assumptions are wrong about strategy. Admittedly, there is a robust online community, including YouTube videos about exactly that. I haven't made use of these resources yet, because I'm lazy and haven't been motivated strongly enough to seek out the help just yet. But, I'm loving this game as much as I'm hating it, which means I'll probably be checing into some of that soon. Maybe I'll update this review at that time (I definitely won't). 

As of this moment, I'd say, if you're into the setting (roughly feudal Germany crossed with the American Wild West) and you're into the turn-based strategy RPG/hex combat thing, and you like a challenge and getting pissed off at a game, then I recommend this game to you, my friend.

The issue is they usually die after you see that 90% chance to hit miss an uncanny amount of times.  The game is hard simply because it lies to you by telling you to hit #'s that no one should believe.

I recommend it to anyone that likes turn-based strategy  games.
Let me move on to say that the creators of the game delivered, Everything, they said they would and more.
And now, let's move on to what this game was for me.
It was a good pastime.
I mean, that's what a game is. A way to pass the time. And I enjoyed the time I spent playing this one.

Now the gameplay.
You manage a band of mercs. And this pretty much says it all.
You will never become something more or less. You are mercenaries.
Your survival and income is your top priority.
Maybe you want to go adventuring/eploring at some point. I recommend it since it can be very rewarding and let's you discover some of the very nice lore that exists in here.
Keep getting and haggling those contracts. Keep recruiting and training your mercs. Your bands existence depends on it.
Keep your feet on the road and your ears and eyes open.
Opportunities don't come often and danger is waiting around the corner.
The battles can be hard but they are balanced.
If someone says the game's too difficult, he's doing it wrong. If that someone is you, I suggest you don't quit. I also won't suggest you ""git gud"" I have seen thrown around quite often.
I would suggest reading a Little bit more about the weapons. About your targets. About your environment.
This ain't enough to give you the push you needed? That's cool too. Go check some tips. Maybe a youtube video.

Pros:
- Graphical style actually works really really well.
- Combat is enjoyable
- Nice that there is a RPG aspect to the individual brothers
- Variety of equipment options for kitting out your merry band of mercenaries

Cons:
- Little to no company level RPG mechanics or development
- Given the limited scope of the game, I realy wish the character development was deeper.  Its not that its shallow but I feel like it should be alot deeper in terms of number of abilities you can choose and use given the limited scope of the title.
- The combat abilities seem uninspired compared to something like XCOM.  Given the focus on combat, I expected to like using combat abilities more but I just never got excited about them beyond needing them.

You can see a theme here.  Good game, great polish but I just don't find the game to have enough depth to keep me really interested for a long time.  It does what it does very very well - the problem is, when you choose a fairly limited scope for the title, you need to go in really deep pn the mechanics and I just don't see that happening here.

So, TL;DR - good game but don't expect the kind of depth to keep you playing for a long time if your like me as youll likely grow familiar and bored with the mechanics / depth pretty quickly.

The good:
+ A combat system that is as superb as it is unique. Every weapon is distinct, enemies are varied and challenge you with a wide variety of tactics.
+ Enemy AI is generally very good. There are few exceptions (wolfriders are an example).
+ art style is unique and grim - your mercs are fierce-looking and generally ugly bastards as suits a mercenary company.
+ great music
+ huge amount of freedom in an open world
+ extremely challenging gameplay. Battlebrothers is a hard game and it takes some time to master it. After hundreds of hours and several years with this game, I am still refining my gameplay and discovering new builts and strategies.
+ the game doesn't need huge amount of resources. Runs on my old laptop as well as on my PC.

The bad:
- very rudimentary tutorial
- no mod support (although there are some basic mods)
- occasionally rng can be frustrating (usually when several enemy ranged unit crit hit your backline battlebrother in a row, leading to a miserable death)

As regards the latest expansion: It deserves the good reviews it has gotten from most users. Overall it makes the gameplay deeper (new weapons, new enemies, some quality of life improvements, a well-done crafting system).

game mechanics are frustrating, every design aspect aims to fuck the players.

1.there is no learning curve, the game will always brutalize you no matter how good you get. Difficulty will scales with your party size, level, and time, etc. The much better way to improve is to have better equipment while deliberately limiting other variables, which is stupid.

2. ""losing is fun"", said by the loading screen. No it ain't, if you spend dozens of hours grinding your hard earned characters and have them slaughtered due to just one bad encounter, it's simply just tormenting instead of fun.

3.even if you play your cards right and pick the right fights all the time, you are still gonna get fucked by RNG when enemies manage to score luck hits and dodge. remember your loses matter, AI's don't because they'll just spawn some more.

4.some enemies you encounter are just invincible: large ghoul can devour a bro of yours AND keeps attacking; newly added alps can stun lock your bros AND do huge amount of AP damage, not to mention they always spread out at the edge of the map and have a good amount of hp; All these skills I mentioned can't be dodged or blocked. If you encounter a horde of enemies like this you WILL get fucked. So yeah, just keep farming brigands until you have the best equipments

5.witches can control your characters and turn them against you, even if you cheat a bit by unequipping your bros' weapons before the fight and placing high resolve bros in front, you'll still take heavy damage during the fight.

5.This gaming community is just toxic, if you ever try to point out some unbalanced things in the game those baseroom nerds who spent thousands of hours on this game will just tell you to shut up and ""git gud"". I wouldn't be surprised by tons of replies like that under this post.

I'm kinda leaving a review just to offset the occasional negative one you see, which are mostly because people feel like the game is treating them unfairly and it's frustrating for them. The game is indeed very difficult, and RNG plays a role, and things are finely balanced: very small mistakes can easily spiral out of control. The unfairness comes from the willingness of the computer to throw some fights at you that you are really meant to flee from instead of try to win, and it can be hard initially to understand which fights those are.

But that difficulty also makes it very satisfying to succeed, and there are a lot of rewards for really studying the mechanics and the enemies and playing conservatively. Don't be ashamed of playing this for two hundred hours on easy settings before you start to ramp up to where it was 'supposed to be' played, because it is damn hard, and if you're used to modern handholding it will sometimes seem insanely and unfairly difficult.

To me the DLC really completes the gameplay. I love the new weapons and the greater variety of the fights.

Honestly it's my second favorite game concept. Enough so that i spent over a hundred hours trying to force myself to enjoy this absolute disaster of a game. The 3 biggest problems with the game right now are UI is buggy and unforgiving, the character AI is flawed, and the combat is more frustrating than fun at any point in time. 

Starting with the UI. Why do i keep getting booted out of cities? Why does the screen go black and when i reload into the game i've bought an entire towns worth of goods and now somehow have negative 3000 gold when most quests dont give you more than 600? Why do non enemy towns refuse to let me activate them untill i save and reload my game? I have no idea, but I do know I've seen better widget work done on college level projects finished in 3 months.

Second, AI. What the fuck were the devs thinking. Not only do the enemies' AI get super tactical even when facing brigands, but what the hell is up with the absolute garbage allied AI. I've played on all three difficulties, and I still cannot seem to find a single way to keep these bloody morons the game shoves down my throat from charging into the frontline and killing themselves.

Finally, combat. Holy crap. What were you thinking. Stop. When 1 goblin can dodge 11 attacks in a row with on average 60% chance to hit, youve fucked up royally. Most of the monsterous enemies are brutal and unforgiving, but have a surefire way to deal with them when push comes to shove. 

Unholds? Focus fire them down one at a time.
Alps? squads of 3-4 and lots of dogs.
Hexen? Resolve and arrows.
Orcs? Shield walls and hammers.
Knights? Shieldwalls and hammers and axes.
Necroservants? Circle formation and hope you dont have a caravan to protect.
Goblins? well so long as they dont outnumber you or have the high ground you win. but if they do theres really no point in fighting them becasue youre gunna lose like half your guys because fuck you.

Who thought their ability to dodge pretty much every attack even at a beginner difficulty was okay? Who?

Excellent game! I thought I would take a chance on this game uncertain as to whether it was a good fit for an rpg and 4x strat player. I was happily surprised! There is no spoken dialogue. All has been written and there is much to read. I find the text quite engrossing, and fun to read. Normally I care little for too much written dialogue but in this game, it works great. There is much personalization to be had when outfitting and leveling up your crew. Very satisfying indeed, and you can tailor your party members to precisely the tactics you wish to pursue. Much surprise is to be had in terms of random events (in the form of text pop-ups) that creates a very fulfilling experience. You start to feel as if you know your crew and root for them as you play, and mourn their losses to some extent. As a side note: this game IMO has perhaps the third best soundtrack to a modern game just behind Skyrim and Witcher 3 respectively.

I can’t understand how this game has not been talked about more. It is a fantastic game that deserves more attention. Granted it is a niche game centered about turn based tactics upon a hexagonal sectored board during combat. The world map is a top down marker based map that can be roamed freely to pursue baddies or ruins or towns to explore.

This game earns a well deserved 9/10 from me. I could say loads more but honestly, who will have read this far? If your one of those who has - do yourself a favor and buy this game. Worth every penny even when not on sale.

Detractors will tell you that it's unfair, unbalanced, poorly designed or too hard. As always with RNG-based games, they're going in with the wrong expectations. You manage your risks, cut your losses, learn from your mistakes and given some basic management skills you can almost always recover from your losses. People die, equipment is lost, missions fail, reputation ruined - shit happens. Either you made some mistake or you had some bad luck; nobody ever said it wouldn't happen.

Apart from that, here's some minor nitpicks:
- Some strategic play comes down to spotting enemies on the real-time map and hammering space in time to react.
- There are some OP meta builds. But you can always just not use them.
- The music gets a bit repetitive after a few dozen hours, but no matter - it's still good, and you can always turn it off.
- You can't renegotiate contracts after it turns out that your employer greatly exaggerated the simplicity of a mission.

Well I'm still playing this game in spite of my negative review.. I'm a glutton for punishment. if you really like losing and leaning on the save game all the time then maybe you'll like this game. The only other option I see is to play the ironman and just make peace with losing your best team members every day of the week. Not for me so I am on that save save save so I never lose anyone and that's a little unfun.

Still playing it though.. only hiring the beggars and cripples to minimize the salaries. Trying to get a full team strong enough to stop dying not sure if that can ever happen. Very hard to find a weak enough battle for everyone to survive. I have the economy and combat on the hardest difficuly but have to save constantly and redo the battles many times to get a deathless win.

As for the negative review I figure at least one person ought to give it a thumbs down just for the senselessly vulgar tales. It really does detract and maybe the developers will take note. It's just not funny. They are obviously racing to the bottom like much of today's society.

First time i came across some around 100 days into a game, so my brothers were not exactly a weak bunch, there were only 7 alps so even though i had seen the reviews i felt quite confident it would be fine, how wrong i was! First turn all but 1 of my brothers is put to sleep, okay not too bad, woke a couple up with my remaining guy, second turn, everyone is asleep, half of them now have nightmares doing a hefty bit of damage, only one brother wakes up through resolve test, baring in mind all my brothers have at least 50 resolve. I figure maybe that turn was just unlucky, next turn no one wakes up, turn after, still no one wakes up, i am literally just sitting and watching my party die with absolutely nothing i can do about it, which kind of makes playing the game pointless. It would not matter even if my party was equipped with all the best armour and weapons available, it would make no difference. And i do not see what tactics can be employed to beat the Alps when literally no one can do anything every turn.

It's got a little bit of everything, there's that cozy overworld feeling like in Mount&Blade, if you've read the Chronicles of the Black Company the  game just reinforces and adds onto how you'd imagine a medieval mercenary company to be. Dark fantasy is there which serves to reinforce your feeling as a member of the company trying to survive and even abandon your honour and contract for the lives of your men. The gameplay is great too, if a bit repetitive at times.

+
Different weapons serve different purposes, so there is no one meta weapon you want to equip your men with. Having various weapons mixed into the shieldwall is a smart way to go. You want axes against Undead Cohorts and their shields, for Orcs a good spearwall is your best bet. When it comes to zombies you want something that can decapitate and fighting skeletons is dumb if you have piercing weapons like crossbows/bows/spears.

Better armor means heavier armor, heavier armor means your men are going to get tired quickly. So no, donning your archers with the best armor isn't really a good thing.

Small things like being able to rename your party members, change their appearance,get a war dog or a falcon etc

Different enemies use different tactics. Orcs love to rush in and try to stun and overwhelm you. Humans use various tactics including skirmishing, sitting in a shield wall and trying to flank you. Goblins are outright annoying with their poison arrows and running away, also throwing spiky bolas and nets to try to hamper your frontline. The undead are generally stupid, but what they lack in brains they make up for sheer numbers. You won't have to use amazing tactics against undead, but their sheer numbers and ability to reanimate after death can easily tire out your men, and if they've got a necromancer backing them up you're in for some fun times. With ghouls you might think they're pushovers, but little did you know they can devour corpses and grow bigger, with the tier 3 ghoul being able to swallow one of your men aside from being much more tankier.

Your men WILL die, the RNG isn't much of a factor as are your tactics and equipment. If you go barely armored against an Orc Warrior expect heads to literally fly all over the place.

And much more.

-

Some ""choose your own story"" events would be nice. We already got an objective to pick and follow it through for renown, but this is just a ""get 10k gold"" or ""burn 4 orc camps"" which gets boring after a time. Maybe if these objectives had their own little stories or events it would be much more fun to pursue them.

The game gets a bit repetitive after a while. Main problem is that the battlefields are somewhat samey. Some ruins/castles/encampments with their own little natural hazards/barricades etc would be nice.

The random events seem somewhat rare, and when they do happen it's just a bit of flavour and they as well might have never happened.

Generally the main thing that the game lacks is more interaction in the overworld. You can't interact with peasants, mercenary companies, militia etc. A few options where you ask them if they saw some enemies, latest rumours and so on would make it more fun. Also relationship with other merc companies, maybe actually having them take the same contract as you and trying to do it faster. Or getting angry if you finish it just under their nose. Maybe them attacking you in the wilderness to hijack a contract etc. Or another company popping out from nowhere and backing you up in a battle because you helped them before.

65,47392305,english,"On my third play through now (the first 2 ended in trajedy), and I feel I can make a decent review of the game.

Quite frankly, for the price it is an amazing game. 

It is brutally difficult, and very xcom-esque for its ability to allow chance to ruin your day. Because of this, it demands that every fight - no matter how simple - you execute your tactics to their full extent. There isn't a single fight in this game that I am not sitting on the edge of my seat, hoping that my best men aren't going to get beheaded by a pack of dire wolves (happened on my first play through) or ambushed by a group of bounty hunters (happened on my 2nd play through).

The tactics and strategies aren't insanely complex - but thats just fine. For me, the simplicity forces you to get creative with your strategies. Because if you grow complacent you will inevitably get demolished as you enter into the late game. Rotating men into the fighting line between battles when your main men are injured forces you to change your strategy from one fight to the next. 

It looks like the developers are interested in adding new layers to the game, as they add new DLC etc.

If there is one thing I would like to see is larger battles. The max squad size per battle is 12 per side, however the maps are sizable enough that 20 v 20 battles would not feel clostrophobic.

Very happy with the game. If you like strategy, permadeath, tactics, and low magic combat this one is for you.",1544285375,1544285375,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198031828325,237,38,1787,0,1520,1566003774,,

The DLC really turned this game around for me. I'm finding balance much better. Still playing Veteran difficulty (combat) and am hitting my shots much more frequently. I've changed my review to positive. This game deserves it.

2nd Edit:
I've given this game much more time and effort and I'm slowing changing my mind. The new DLC really makes the game playable (imo). I'm on Veteran/Veteran and having a much better time than before. I might land up changing this to a positive review. We'll see.

Original Post:
This game is RNG-based. If you don't have luck with RNG don't play this game. You'll miss everything from greater height than the enemy who will land everything. Great idea for a game and I wish I could post a positive review because I've been looking for a game like Darkest Dungeon for a long time. Unfortunately it is not skill-based and really frustrating when your entire company dies to an ant (hyperbole).

3,47236228,english,"This game boils down to this...

you: miss miss miss miss miss miss miss miss miss.

Don't bother pumping points into hit chance, it wont make any difference as you never seem to be able to crack 70 percent hit chance, and even then you miss so much I think it's actually at 30 and the tooltip is broken.

AI: one shot kill, one shot kill, one shot kill, one shot kill... on your guys who are leveled up and have plate on sometimes. Oh, did I mention they have like a 90 percent chance to hit you too? Even if you've put points into dodge. Combat is basically you going ""oh look! my guy with 180 armor had his armor destroyed and 90 percent of his health taken away in one hit... AGAIN! Nice! Oh cool! three of my guys got insta killed by that brigand sniper who has an 80 percent hit chance with golden death arrows who can shoot you from across the entire map!"" Don't ask me how that is even possible *shrugs*. I guess buy this thing if you're into masochistic comedy.

Ignore the good reviews on here, because frankly people are making a whole lot of excuses for this game's horrible combat system.

Missions never pay you enough to buy better quipment too, since you constantly have to buy tools and bandages to just make sure your guys don't die even easier than they already do. As someone else stated, this is less of a tactical RPG like XCOM and more of a brutal survival simulator that gives you little chance. If you like self-flaggelation, this is the game for you. I'll pass. This is a shame too because if the combat wasn't so unforgiving and unfair, and the survival aspects were toned down slightly it would be a gem.

19,47269053,english,"This is the best and deepest turn-based strategy game I have played in years. It is on par with the old Panzer General games in terms of enjoyment.

Pros:
Great depth and variety. Weapons, characters, internal game dynamics are well done. 

Cons:
There are certain nuances that are not explained in game or the tutorials that I watched. e.g. Destroying enemy armor in a battle makes it unlootable. This is logically but not spelled out in any guide. (You can use daggers to make attacks that bypass armor to avoid the loss of the equipement). That said, these are the kind of details the make the game great. 
Graphics are acceptable but nothing striking. I doubt that people that play this type of game are focused on visuals however. 

It is very challenging. I play on the veteran difficulty and prefer Ironman. Even a minor mistake or unexpected random event can end any chance of end-game success. The game does not stop until your last man dies; however, if you lose your equipment and elite players deep into the game. You will be retuced to being an armed merchant attempting trade enough to rebuild your crew. Even on easy economic difficult (the economic difficult can be set separately from the combat difficulty), I've found this challenging. The opponents continue to grow in difficulty over time regardless of any set backs it seems. 

Overall, one of the best games I've played in years. Shocked that this was done by an independent studio.

I've also always been drawn to RPGs and fantasy worlds.  Battle Brothers combines all three of these loves into a single package.

I put about 60 hours into the game before the recent DLC dropped, and I expect that my play time will increase dramatically now that there is more to do.  This game will teach you how to accept the consequences of a poor strategic move, or simply an unlucky roll of the dice.  Brothers will die.  You will (probably) save scum.  However, accepting losses and moving forward will make you enjoy the game even more. 

The perma-death and RNG elements will certainly be a negative for a lot of gamers.  Fans of X-COM and Darkest Dungeon will understand that posessing the mental fortitude to push through those moments of frustration will reward the player with a more potent story filled with meaningful, sometimes bitter loss. 

Traveling the strategic layer is like moving through a map inside the cover of your favortie fanatsy novel.  It is filled with random world events, the stories of which are told with wit and wisdom.

My biggest gripe with the game is the lack of a visual representation of the progression of time.  Seasonal changes would be a welcome addition, along with more dynamic weather in the strategic layer.

48,47239462,english,"There are very few games that I will go out of my way to spend extra money on buying stuff like soundtracks and 'support the devs' DLC.  Battle Brothers is one of them.  With the new DLC just having come out I've been dragged back in and figured it was as good at time as any to post a review.

So, for those of you who don't know Battle Brothers is a tactical turn based strategy game with a strong ephisis on character customization and skermish combat.

The core concept is that you are a mercenary commander.  That's it.  Your job is to recruit a band of up to 20 mercenaries and lead them to fame and fortune.  You begin with a rag tag group of survivors, ratcatchers and deserters armed with farm implements and padded shirts and end up with an elite company of mercenaries outfitted with suits of plate armour, legendary swords and a bad attitude.  

It's one of those games where the journy matters more than the destination.  You aren't out saving the world (at least not on purpose) and there is no great overarching storyline, though the assorted crisis do provide motivation.  Instead the stories are emergent, tied to the exploits of your rag tag band of antiheroes that are created as you throw them into a series of brutal and challenging contracts.

The meat of the game is the tactical combat where your mercs fight in a hex based grid against a variety of different enemies from bandits, other mercenaries and noble soldiers to orcs and goblins or a variety of undead.  The battle grid can be made of of several different biomes and each contains a variety of different terrain types and elevations  all providing tactical options that reward flexibility.  Your brothers can be extensively customized as they gain experience and rise in levels distributing points across 8 different attributes and selecting from a wide range of perks that serve to offer even more options.  As far as gear goes you can equip them with weapons from 12 different categories each with different strengths and weaknesses.  Hammers for instance are exceptionally good at bashing through targets with heavy armour but are wasted against lightly armoured agile enemies while cleavers do horrendous damage to unarmoured targets but struggle against any kind of protection.

Of course getting them to that point is far from easy.  The combat is tough as nails and the AI is pretty decent.  Many of the more exotic enemies have special abilities that require specific counters and since much of your advancement comes from looting the fallen there is always an incentive to ride the edge and tackle encounters where the enemey outclasses you.  Your bro's will die.  Regularly, and keeping a steady stream of replacements is key to survival.  As your company gains fame and fortune developing a cohesive strategy for how to protect and advance your more valuable your bros becomes absolutely essential.

The strategic side of the game revolves around managing the company itself.  You travel from town to town picking up contracts for everything from raids on bandit camps to graverobbing and caravan escorts.  Different contracts are assigned difficulty ratings from 1-3 which impacts the pay as well as any expected opposition.  You're in a constant race to earn more money since in addition to buying equipment and hiring new bros you need to keep them fed and paid regularly or they will begin to abandon your cause.  There is a little bit of light roleplaying as well mostly in the form of short text based decision trees where you can choose to help or hinder people you meet in a variety of different random encounters.  Nothing too deep, but it offers some variety to the gameplay.  There are even trade goods so you can supplement your income with a little bit of light trading, though this is rarely a huge money maker.

I haven't had much of a chance to play with the new DLC yet, but from what I can see it brings a lot of very nice changes to the game things like increasing the map size, new contracts, gear crafting and customization among others will add a lot of replayability.  There are some quality of life improvements too like the ability to pay a small fee in order to have a potential recruit 'try out' which reveals his hidden traits which will be particlarly valuable in the mid to late game when debating whether or not to hire an expensive recruit.

All and all Battle Brothers ranks up there with some of my favorite games of all time.  It's unique, challenging and by and large an absolute ton of fun.  As of right now it's 40% off too so it's a great time to give it a whirl.",1543691601,1543691601,True,18,0,0.683556079864501953,0,True,False,False,76561197993001046,644,3,8979,0,6366,1597357443,,

51,47236158,english,"Battle Brothers is an atmospheric and well written game set in a grueling, randomly generated world generally populated by a few noble houses and guild masters who see you as the solution to their problems. The gameplay is brutal, even on easier difficulties. Losing mercenaries is going to happen frequently, and you might just straight up rage-quit when your best guy gets decapitated by a crit, and sometimes combat feels a bit unfair. Generally, however, even without detailed animations, combat is very visceral and enjoyable, even to someone who doesn't generally like turn-based strategy, thanks to how smooth and quick everything is.

I think the real star of this game is the writing, even if it reads a bit janky due to the randomness sometimes. Nothing like being paid to kill some spiders, and to prove that you succeeded you hoist the giant spider's corpse up to the guys window and scare the shit out of him. The game is jam packed with all sorts of tiny random events, and they all really help to draw you in and give life to your mercenaries. The beggars might try to bum cash off of you from time to time, but the monk you recruited might help them kick their alcoholism, leaving you with stronger recruits.

If you can get over the difficulty, this game is quite atmospheric and immersive. You find yourself caring for your men and even the asshole blue-bloods who pay you to kill goblins have varied personalities. It sucks when someone you like dies, but feels great when you decapitate the head of a local bandit clan.

59,47225848,english,"So, all-in-all I really like what this game is going for. Building a mercenary band and trying to make your mark in an unforgiving world is an amazing concept. It even gets a lot of the core aspects of the tactical RPG right, at least on the surface. Everything your characters equip changes their look (which is always cool), and leveling your characters in specific ways does make them all feel different over time.

My major gripe with the game is the terrible RNG at play. I thought Darkest Dungeon had some rough RNG, but I firmly believe this game has the least balanced RNG I've ever dealt with. I can't tell you how many times I've missed attacks, over and over, only to have the enemy group hit almost every time, and even slay a couple guys outright. Its completely absurd, and takes any enjoyment away from an otherwise well put together game.

I enjoy a challenge, but I honestly haven't found a viable way to make it anywhere in this game without looking up some sort of guide or helper, and that's just sad to me. Even on the easiest difficulty it doesn't help you at all, and the enemies still completely wipe the floor with you. I'd hate to even think about the higher difficulties, or starting with less money in the beginning. I haven't felt rewarded for any mission I've undertook, and upkeep is insane for how often I've been able to actually make a few coin in-game.

If you're looking for a game to beat the ever loving $#!T out of you over and over, only to make it one battle further than your last playthrough, than you've found your game. I really wanted to enjoy it, but after 7 hours of retrying, getting my @$$ handed to me, and then asking why I never hit the enemy, I have to give it a solid Thumbs Down.

7,30772961,english,"So, at 600++ hours in this game and rapidly increasing I felt a review might be an order since I might have some valid insights. There's a tl;dr at the bottom and a final recommedation. Spoiler: [spoiler] Game is awesome, go buy! Even at full price! [/spoiler]

[i]Battle Brothers is a game where you recruit a band of mercenaries to do your bidding in increasingly difficult turn based tactical battles doing favors for lords and villages on a randomly generated map. Its reminiscent of games like Jagged Alliance, Final Fantasy Tactics, and older X-Com, but set in a low fantasy middle ages setting.[/i]

[h1] Graphics [/h1] 
Crisp and clear with a well defined artstyle there's absolutely nothing wrong with how the game is presented. It feels professional, all the art is homogenous and in line with the tone of the game. The animations when doing actions is similar with the feel of a chess board where the pieces come to life. Presentation of combat and how its executed visually very much lends itself from Jagged Alliance with some gore, blood and bodies strewn. For this type of game I'll give it a 8 out of 10.

[h1] Music  [/h1] 
It's the surprise takeaway from this game. I'm not gonna say much else than I've played this game for a long time, often 8-10 hours straight without ever feeling the need to put on a podcast or any background music. It's non-intrusive, at least 2 hours or so of diversity, feels very much in line with the setting and has some moments where you actually love the atmosphere it sets. For the size of the game, music is one of its standouts. 9 out of 10.

[h1] Cinematics [/h1] 
Nonexistent in this game. Also, not needed, game is entirely open and very much a case of creating your own story. 

[h1] Story [/h1] 
Much like cinematics, this game doesn't really have a story. Granted, after awhile you'll run into some end game content(without the game actually ending when it's done) but the ""story"" of the game limits itself to newsworthy popups and events here and there that in the long run doesn't really matter. If you are the kind of player who like to create your own little world with the brothers you have signed to do your bidding this really isn't much of a problem.

[h1] Content [/h1] 
Not gonna lie. It feels a bit light on content. That being said, I've played more than 600 hours. Even World of Warcraft starts to feel a little contentless after that much time. Game has this ""faction"" system of foes, meaning that races and types of enemies have fighting styles that are unique to them, and in many respects this is the meat of the game. So content is very much tied to the differences in enemies you'll likely face. Outside of the battles, the game feels slightly ""dead"" and just waiting around for your mercenary company to come around. It's the one major drawback of the game and the one I hope the devs will flesh out the most in a sequel. If you are looking for Mount and Blade-levels of intrigue on the map you need to go play that. I'll give the game 6 out of 10 for its content. Its enough for an indie title, and for the casual player you'll probably never see all the game has to offer.

[h1] Controls [/h1] 
A non issue again. Its turn based and the UI is intuative and functional for what it sets out to do. You'll quickly learn the most needed shortcuts and for me the game is long set in muscle memory. As with cinematics and story I'll opt to not set a score for a feature the game doesn't really provide or need.

[h1] Gameplay [/h1] 
Touched upon this for content and the gameplay is really good when it comes to the tactical battles. It is like a chessmatch and it nearly has the same depth and variation. If you love this part of the game you'll rack up the same hours as me and several others in no time. In fact, its so good you'll forgive the game for actually being somewhat flawed in all other gameplay aspects. 

By ""flawed"" I'm also being nitpicky to a certain degree. I've mentioned the ""dead"" feel of the game world already, the economics are simple but functional, weaponry and gear has a adequate tier-system and named unique items, and brothers have talents and levels. It's all there and it all works just fine. It just lacks.... any standout depth compared to the combat. It's not bad, it just feels like an afterthought and just filler until you get into a fight again. On the plus side, there's no hard level cap on battle brothers anymore. When you reach top level, you get veterancy which means your mercenaries will still improve, if not at a much slower rate. The rest of the time you just walk around on the map looking for contracts while trying not to starve to death or run into stray orc warriors.

Managing weaponry and armor for your band of brothers is overall really fun, although you sometimes wish you could preset ""loadouts"" for type of opponent as some weaponry works well against some, but worse against other. Learning how to deal which each set of opponents, and noticing how much just a minor tactical decision in a fight can radically change the outcome is masterfully done and is by every definition of the word just a top notch effort made by the development team. I'll give this aspect of the game 8/10.

[i] tl;dr and final conclusion [/i]
Game is excellent, and is comparable to a turn based Mount and Blade or a Jagged Alliance in a medival low fantasy setting. It's very much one of the games you want to throw money at if you are fan of the genre, and you like modern games to have more focus on gameplay and less on interactive story and ""quicktime"" events. Needless to say I don't like it when my games treat me like I'm there to watch a movie or read a book.

I'll rate this game as one of the absolute best I've played the last few decades and it's a polished gem that only deserves to be a even bigger game in the future. Hopefully it's as successful as it deserves to be and it'll get a even grander sequel. Run out and buy! ...or no, stay where you are and click the buy button on steam now!

Final score: 8/10

15,47080264,english,"This is a really fun game. Its very addicting and a time suck but great fun. It does seem to slog a bit toward the end game. 
I have to say that is really fun discovering what the world has to offer but its a double edged sword since you want to survive and explore more and if you make one wrong move your troops get decimated.
Specifics:
Combat  is really interesting for most of the game especially since you get to level up your guys but you get really attached and if someone suffers a crit injury you are really tempted to start the battle over again since its so hard to find really good statted guys. This creates an interesting dilemna either let the game go on and slog through till you get your team back up to spec or keep playing the same battle until its favorable to you and remember some of the battles are intentionally not in your favor.

Economics int this game are a mixed bag since you dont have a home base you have to carry everything with you. This creates a strange set of circumtance since you will start to keep guys around just to carry extra shit so you can equip your heavy hitters. You get money mostly from combat and a little from trading but you have to work your ass off to really get ahead which I guess is pretty realisitc but man It makes it a slog sometimes finding the right contracts and trying to survive which feels more like work and less like a game.

Contracts are interesting and you get hits about who you will face as you learn to recognize the different lanuage that the contractees use to hire you. It is kinda fun getting in the good graces of settlements and cities which I would say is one of the most fun aspects of the game. This gets even more fun when there is the noble war. 

TLDR; Good game solid mechanics interesting contracts, each game is different give it a try but expect a decent learning curve and some lost games.

27,47014420,english,"This is a game that focuses on exactly what it wants to be and accomplishes it marvelously. The game is meant to be a nitty gritty tactics game where you play as the leader of a medieval mercenary company. The world is very grounded and though it includes Orcs, Undead, and German fairytale styled monsters they are all very ""real"" in setting. If someone is stabbed, there is no magic healing and instead you will need to find someone in town to treat their wounds and keep them out of the fighting for a little bit until they recover. Undead exist but they are utterly mindless and instead march towards your troops without thought. This makes them easy to outwit and force them to smash into a wall of spears and pikes however....no matter how much pain you inflict they will not cease their advance until they have been destroyed. Bandits arent very brave and will run if the tide turns however they also arent stupid and will try and move around your heavily defended center.

Battle Brothers takes a randomly generated, grounded, medieval world and asks you to survive as a mercenary band. It isn't easy and at higher difficulties you will sometimes die before you ever really had a chance. But if you like a well thought out tactics system that is heavily influenced by real medieval tactics, arms and armour (on a small scale) OR you just want to see if your band of ratcatchers, shamed fishermen, and cripples can make a name for themselves in a challenging game then Battle Brothers is certainly worth your consideration.",1543213607,1543213607,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197980277723,439,8,3407,0,3334,1562713739,,

34,40976373,english,"Well I think I can finally say I have played the game enough to write a fairly detailed review:
The Good:
If you like Difficult Tactical Strategy games then this is for you, the econmoics of the game don't let you play hoarder style, you have to go out and fight to make the money you need to pay your men and upgrade their equipment. The character developement is easy to understand and very customizable, the units start with base stats and proficiencies that you will want to pay attention too, those little stars next to stats mean they will level up faster than others so pay attention to those! The reputation system is fairly balanced and easy to understand, if you kill a lords men he probably isn't going to like you too much and if you rob a caravan you are guarding then don't expect to much more of that work to come your way. The maps are fairly large and randomized, you'll get a different look each time. Really like that map you just got your but handed to you on? The map seed number will allow you to recreate it but not everything will be the same! (random dungeons will appear in different locals in the wilderness) The enemies aren't stupid, if you are up against goblin arcehers those little green bastards are going to hide in bushes and poison you, up against undead with a necromancer? The enemies run forward with no fear as they know they can simply be raised again. The knights of the great houses use tactics befitting their armies. In the beginning the rabble will just run right at you, don't expect it to last! Making friends with local towns is essential if you want the more lucrative missions, but choose carefully because if you lose a Battle Brother they are gone for good, death is permanent. 
The Bad
The Developers have said they are not releasing anymore content for the game, while that may change, at the moment the Lindwurm update is the only one out. You cannot build your own town or mercenary base, which I think would have pushed this game over the top for awesomeness. The RNG is unforgiving, at the start of the game you will miss, men will die and you will scream bloody murder at the screen (it does get better with leveled up skills). 

I totally reccomend this game, I have played it for hours and hours and always find myself going back to try a new mix of units and tactics. I would love to see further updates, building your own towns, perhaps even a scenario where you are the invading menace or your end goal is to unite the world. I would also love to see an undead and greenskin scenario but these are my only gripes. The game, as is, is well worth the money.

Late game scenarios like greenskin invasions, undead uprisings, etc... also add to the interest.

Guess I should explain why xD sense this game deserves it. 

It works on similar principles as ftl, xcom, and a little bit of final fantasy tactics. Combat is tactical and % based. As the commander you have a band of brothers that move around the world doing encounters and events. 

Pros
+Rich and humour filled events. Events have dialog options that are effected by your party classes. *similar to ftl*
+Difficult and satisfing. Even if the war is not won, winning a hard battle can be gaming euphoria.
+Seed related map. Every game can be a whole new world!
+3 unique soft endgame events. I say soft endgame because the game doesn't end unless you retire / die.
+Unique weapons and gear. 
+ability to customize troops. 
+Traditional stats for troops with a real unique quirk where they the troops stats are somewhat random on pick up, and also those stats have benifits randomly. This supports a feeling of true excitement to recruitment. Sometimes it may sting at times tho!
+Enemies has varied valid tactics. Subtle but very very neat.

The team behind this game is also superb.

When others abandon their products, sometimes even during Early Access, Overhype Studios went the extra mile and still kept working on the game until they felt it was indeed polished to a point where they couldn't improve upon the game without having to re-write the entire thing.

Add to that the free DLC ""Lindwurm"" and now - as a surprise to me - another DLC (""Beasts & Exploration"") to expand a game that is already huge to begin with.

You will grow attached to the members of your mercenary band, which makes it all the more painful when the inevitable time comes that they perish in battle.

Each map is randomly generated and dotted with beautiful and detailed towns, cities, and battlefields all coupled with an excellent musical score. Each battle is a mental exercise in patience and tactical thinking, with different enemies and environments requiring different approaches. When not fighting battles, you are managing other aspects of your mercenary company: recruiting new soldiers, purchasing food and medical supplies for the myriad of injuries your soldiers will suffer, as well as maintaining your gear all the while ensuring that there is a steady stream of income to actually pay your mercenaries and keep them happy.

Bertwin our best 2H swordsman, slayer of 517, with us for 435 days went down to filthy 'gobos' with 3 other experienced brothers in one grim battle. A sad day for the band. Some said we would never recover.

Gisbert, our best archer fell a few weeks later in an undead fiasco. Moving up behind the front line when a Possessed fallen hero with a broadsword split through the lines twice in one turn. He didn't even see it coming. He'd been with us longer than Bertwin.

Ewald, a superstitious old sword master shuffles past with 4 beers to the quite end of the table. Reynhart, former daytaler and sure footed bleeder, unknown to some a blade master with 1126 kills quietly takes his beer and thanks his old friend with smile. These days old Ewald's sight is poor and he has long since given up the sword. Now he wields 'King Niels's Harbinger' a 2H axe like the devil himself, and has saved many a brother. Reynhart's protégée Humbert, an insecure refugee, and now the future of the most famous mercenary company in the land takes his with a polite nod. The forth, a Vagabond, Magnus 'the Filly Fiddle' with an er questionable past gratefully takes the last beer.

They talk of the tell of others that give up the life and bemoan their misfortune for all to hear. ""This land is lost"", ""RNG"". True 'tis not the life for everyone that be sure. The life of a mercenary in this brutal medieval land is indeed a hard life, and survival is not guaranteed.  Yet with perseverance and imagination you can succeed. As Ewald was taught so we learnt to walk before we ran, spears and shields before fancy blades. Some of us listened as Lief the sergeant shouted “hold the line!” and some of us survived.

Magnus, a vagabond who fought at the Black Monolith knows best of all that we bigger than any one man. Heroes come, heroes die, and yet the band endures, it's name whispered by peasants and nobles alike in ever corner of the land as a beacon of light in these dark times.

57,46738274,english,"Battle Brothers is to me like a turn-based strategic Mount & Blade. You have a mercenary company in an open world and your choices control your destiny. Like Mount & Blade, it's a game that has captured my attention and won't let go.

What you should know going in: 
*This game is difficult, and can be downright hardcore if you so desire. Your mercenaries will die, especially early on. Battles are brutal and there is a definite learning curve. 
*This is a create-your-own story type of game. Your given objectives and can choose goals, but the ""story"" of this game is how your mercenary group progresses and individuals in that group who become essential in that progress. 
*Battle Brothers is also a game that requires time commitment. Time to learn the game and time to fully beat the end-game scenarios. I've got over 100 hours and have not ""won"" a game yet.

What I like best about the game:
*The difficulty and the sense of accomplishment when your mercenary group becomes powerful.
*The little events that take place throughout.
*The overall setting and how end game events can dramatically alter the world.
*The fallibility of your mercenaries. Almost everyone is flawed.

Honestly, my biggest gripe was always that the game felt unfinished in the sense that there was a wonderful skeleton. So wonderful in fact that I could enjoy it for over 100 hours, and I'm the type of gamer who bounces around incessantly. That said, it always felt as though it could have been so much more! For that reason, I'm exceedingly happy to see the upcoming DLC which seems ready to add much need depth in areas. Better progression, more mid-to-late game content, the ability to try out recruits, more events... the list goes on. I wouldn't say any of these were needed to make this game fun and recommendable, but they were needed to push it into the realm of great.

I have heard some folks complain about the art style (shoulders only, etc.) but the amount of detail which has been put into the designs is astounding.  If one of your brothers get hit his model is updated corresponding to the damage.  Hit on the head?  Helmet shows dents, you get a black eye, scratches, etc.  Hist in the body?  Torn armor, bloody cuts.  This awesome level of detail is found in nearly every aspect of the game.  Tons of fun little stories happen as you travel related to character backgrounds, interactions, contracts, or just random ""encounters"".

Most of your mercs will die a gruesome violent death beneath the fangs and blades of some monster or bandit... but then you will be prepared, you will have more money and experience and buy better recruits: Squires, witch hunters, hedgeknights, retired soldiers and the like- they will die violently and quite messy, just like your rookies, but you will face even greater odds, which adds so much to the fun!

6,46135581,english,"  Having backed Battle Brothers in the rough and tumble days of green light, when developers could promise the moon and deliver nothing, I can state that OverHyped studios are a fine example of what the system could and should have been.

  Initially a short and punishing low fantasy sand-box, Battle Brothers has grown steadily and lovingly over the years. Sucking up my leisure hours every few months, revisiting and starting up again was genuinely exciting with each few patch roll outs. Built on an admittedly hardcore strategy game that will make you angry at jammy goblin archers crit-ing your beloved Tank right in his grubby face, OverHyped have been committed to fleshing out the world and your merry little band's impact on it.

Seeing how this has taken effect, from the early-bland, 'go here', 'attack a thing' days to the latest patches where you have to navigate world- wide crises and treasure hunt in truly uncharted land, there's a lot of scope for laid back roleplay.

  The criticisms many have remain. It is merciless, and luck is undoubtedly a factor. It can be frustrating and after a while you might crave a more narrative driven experience, but if you like persevering against the odds, slowly growing a hearty band of plebs and watching them all die having learnt something, then Battle Brothers is for you. I happily bounce between this and Crusader Kings 2 when I need to fall back on a comfort to scratch that Strategy itch.

  The latest update (as yet unreleased) looks to expand the game further and I will certainly be back for the experience. I don't even balk at the reasonable DLC price given it is a proper update and not just a hat (Though the developers do give you the options to buy a 'support us' hat, an invitation I declined and have never regretted). I felt the need to write this review to not only check of a stupid achievement in the autumn sale (because I'm a dork with too much time on his hands, have you read nothing?), but the give kudos to a development studio that is a fine example of how to make and develop games. I've nominated them as such, and if you have been pleasantly surprised by them over the years too, I suggest you do the same.

  Scroll through the other reviews to hearty tales of woe and misfortune, glory and gritty battles. I won't spoil any of it for you. Your Brother will probably be better looking than mine, more feted and only ever crit.

  Just kill every Goblin you see... Until One of the new Monsters takes over my most feared list.

TL:DR

Developers have consistantly worked to make small improvements in a labour of love.

Goblins Suck.

- character customization
- dumb AI for dumb enemies (wolves, zombies), smart AI for human enemies (humans wont walk into you spearwall)
- management (party, inventory, food, tools, etc)
- neat little random events every once in a while
- random events sometimes give choices
- different random events for different brother character backgrounds
- you'll get attached to you brothers like you did when playing XCOM
- character portraits change if a brother has an (permanent) injury

Your goal is to create a mercenary company to stand the test of time: train your battle brothers, purchase and loot equipment, hunt for treasure, beasts and legendary locations.

The world of Battle Brothers is harsh, dangers and challenges abound and death is always close by for the mercenary captain who will rush into battle unprepared. Various environments and enemies require different approaches to beat. Making the most of your men's talents is essential but even the best mercenary cannot stand alone; the company is what makes individuals strong, be it in the form of a spearwall or shieldwall, or a timely intervention with bandages to prevent death from bleedings.

But, what really makes Battle Brothers stand out, apart from its excellent tactical battles, is its ability to generate stories, memorable episodes, both happy and devastating; that time you beat those werewolves, againsta all odds, or the day you lost your best swordman to an orc warrior. It's what brings the world of Battle Brothers to life and what's kept me coming back for more all this time. 

The upcoming Beasts & Exploration DLC will add more equipment customization options, new enemies, new locations, new traits for your mercenaries and, of course, new weapons. Excellent support makes this indie gem a true labor of love.

------------------------------------------------

A tactical turn-based strategy form of Mount and Blade - same drag the stuff from the store over into your inventory.  But the 2nd easiest difficulty setting in Battle Brothers is ""veteran"" - which you might think means ""I played X-Com"" but it seems impossibly difficult, where the ability to feed and pay your troops and hire new troops and keep them adequately equipped for the slaughter that will immediately come within the first few days is possibly an intermittent ability wholly dependent on random number generator.

So I'll go back to the easiest setting and hope it's still an interesting game that way.

Regardless - the difficulty curve is intriguing, and I don't feel I've made a mistake buying this at full price.  Here's to hoping there's some fun to be had other than the oh-so-rare ""I got so lucky that time"" - since that's not really what I'm after.  But just for the new fresh context and arrangement the game is still worth full price - even for a not-so-much-rogue-like-fan like me.

------------------------------------------------

Update:  Playing on the easiest difficulty is still very challenging.  Times eventually get desperate and there is a very subtle balancing act to avoid paying more than the loot/pay affords.  I'm even wondering if it would make sense to avoid leveling characters to keep their income in check, until after more cities open more jobs.

Lots of choice-making tension - should you wander to the next city hoping to find work - or wander out into the wilderness and hope to find a random hideout that might be way overpowered?

It's almost impossible to avoid keeping everyone alive in each battle too, which adds to the pain!

------------------------------------------------

The tactics also remind me a lot of chess.  Positioning means everything and once a piece is trapped it may never come out alive.  Of course it's still dependent on the RNG - this is not pure deterministic tactics.  Still there is some degree of forward thinking that comes into play - anticipating when it makes sense to swap out weapons, and finding a sweet spot of effectiveness for weapon strength versus fatigue or AP.

------------------------------------------------

Battle Brothers has a lot of German references both in the city names and in the background noise, and some of the text reads a bit like it might have been translated.  According to their website, Overhype Studios is located in Hamburg Germany.

Edit 2 (Oct. 2018): Previously I gave this game a negative review because the developers said that the game would receive no further development -- the game was finished in it's very unfinished state. Since then they seem to have continued releasing content and a new DLC is on it's way. I don't know what changed but since the game is being updated I would give it a hesitant thumbs up.

*ORIGINAL

Well, pretty nice game..very simple to manage. The weapon system open the way to more strategy which is pretty nice....

i recommend that game, the only drawback is the replayability, the campaign is pretty much the same..once i'll finish it I don't think i'll come back to that game again....

also, for thoses who love difficult games..well this one is the hardest i have ever tried so far!!

Ok i retract what I said..this game is just AWESOME...it's like a final fantasy tactic with replayability. The more I i go deep into the game, the more the world expend with the history unfolding. By story I mean, this game is random, when they say ramdoly generated, I didn't expect that ALL the npc in the game would also act into the world shaping it, which eventually affect your descision or the way you want to be ''part'' of it.

I mean....32$ for this?? Really, first time I meant that a game should be more expansive. 

Also, if the devs can add more and more content, this game will just become a pearl/diamond!

*CHANGED

Devs stop working new contents on this product, now said, 32$ is a steep price for the content that they provided in the game.

Random events that happen during your journey add some really lovely flavor, and with all the different backgrounds your bros can have, it can lead to quite a lot of different outcomes.

You fight it.
You fight it, until one day, it is Battle Brothers laying dead on the filthy, muddy battleground of some irrelevant skirmish in the back of beyond, and not you.
That's what you do to Battle Brothers.

I am going to tentatively recommend this game.  When it is good, it is very very good.  When it is bad it is INFURIATING!  I personally believe there is some sort of bug in the RNG or display of odds.  I have just had so many high percentage hits miss, and conversely low percentage hits connect - it just seems way out of proportion to actual odds.  Plus the game is brutal as all hell and utterly unforgiving of errors.  Your margin for mistakes is wafer thin.  I am a roguelike player and largely Ironman gamer of of about 35 years of experience and have beaten ADOM, TOME, FTL  and others, usually on the harder modes.   XCom (modern, original, and Terror From the Deep) on ironman classic and more etc.  Dark Souls 1 and 2.    I have been beating hard games since the 1980s!  I have had many unfair defeats in assorted games, and lost hundreds of hours of play across these punishing games to bad strategy and occasional RNG issues and Battle Brothers just seems a bit broken to me on various levels. 

But at its heart is a really good game, its just a shame there is so much frustration in the way.  

Anyway, I have finally managed to 'GIT GUD' (well, fairly good) at this game, and have a 200+ day Veteran difficutly Ironman company of nasty sons o' b**ches who survived Orc Invasion and Noble War so far, and I STILL think there is something wrong with RNG because I STILL see really peculiar 'luck' happening on a regular basis.  Also, it tends to force you into two handed build in late game  since the sheer number of enemies hitting you at once (25-45 with tier 2+ weapons and armour against your capped 12 man team AT ONCE.  It's lucky there is a perk to handle being outnumbered.  Sheesh!)  means you really need to kill huge numbers quickly.  So be warned.  To enjoy this game will require many false starts and great persistence until  things go right enough (and yeah, you learn enough) that you can get some traction and get a pool of cash and solid recuits to survive the weird luck and your own screw ups.  So, one for masochists.  But there is fun to be had here.  Also, clawmarks from your own nails on your face,  a sore throat from screaming insults at the screen, and an annoyed wife who is telling you to stop swearing so much - because you missed your ninth 95%+ probability shot in a row (I kid you not!  This has happened in several fights!) and see your best guy die because of it.  Yeesh.  I mean, come on, swearing is appropriate for that, right?

17,44756498,english,"Recommended, but wish there was a neutral option.

Overall a fun & challenging game. Has a lot of potential to last hundreds of hours for the right players. But others, such as myself will find frustration of events happening predictably outside one's control. There is enough RnG ahead to satisfy a gamblers heart.
The tactical map is quite fun although could utilize more content. Extra options would give this aspect layers of depth. However hunting enemies, trade, exploration & overall movement are enjoyable. 
The combat initially is fun however the RnG goes deeper than simply hitchance as lack of control on positioning & planning can create significant losses outside one's control. RnG seed seems off balance as well since certain maps have been steamrolls then others see several characters miss successive 80+% hitchances consistently on sometimes predictable occasion. This uneven distribution is enough to catch players attention yet  is written all over the game as to be expected, but that doesn't necessarily equate to enjoyable gameplay for everyone. It also creates very specific character development in order to come & so creates somewhat rigid playstyles, again based on RnG of mercenary hires.

Overall, it has a good deal of potential if developers continue adding to game beyond upcoming DLC. Additions such as allowing proper tactical insertion (Jagged Alliance 2, X-com, FFT) would create far better combat scenarios while retaining current RnG hitchance model. Addition of structures on map would go far way as well, considering no architecture to speak of exists on the battlefield. Also, Mods would make this game absolutely fan-freaking-tastic....game could have crazy amount of depth if allowed.

- the lack of linear story line IS A GIFT <3 The game is different yet the same (in a good way) every time it's re-played;
- The visuals, omg, the design of all the dudes, beasts and villains one comes across is simply yummy. The design is top-notch, lovely germanic setting and full of colour and grit;

next they will add horses to pay for, after that castle stages to fight at to pay for, next another late-game mode to pay for, next they add magic spells to pay for...I think I made my point

51,41157538,english,"My review of this game has fluctuated drastically over time. After playing Battle Brothers for 20 hours, I didn’t recommend it. I was very frustrated by near constant death and my lack of understanding regarding game mechanics which resulted in party destruction and/or save scumming multiple times. At that point, I started reading some of the community guides and put in another 40 hours (60 total) and changed my opinion to recommended but with some misgivings. I made it to around day 140 on veteran/veteran.

At about 100 hours, I was starting to dislike the game again due to wild variation in RNG resulting most commonly in enemy crossbowmen regularly hitting 5% headshots on your archers and killing them in one or two shots. 

That being said, I’m at around 400 hours now and have taken an ironman veteran/veteran to 750 days completing the black monolith (Where a lot of good men lost their lives). I love this game despite how it can frustrate me. Approach the game with the expectation that bad luck happens and you’ll lose people. It’s more noticeable when RNG hurts you than when it helps you, but the numbers are pretty even… except with necrosavants. Those guys always dodge. 

Overall, this game is test of patience, cunning, resolve, and willingness to abandon your pride to flee a losing battle. Even at the endgame, carelessness with your veteran+ characters can result in death.

I’m hopeful with the coming DLC update that a few improvements will be made to accepting more than one contract at a time… or accepting a second contract after the first one is complete so you don’t waste so much time just walking between towns.

53,28410401,english,"For people who enjoy low fantasty, realistic, strategy oriented games, this RPG is really going to do a number on you. What blows me away is that this game is in early access but the balancing, core game mechanics, and overall attention to detail are all there. The only thing that is lacking is variety and more features and honestly those are usually the easier things to fix when patching a game. 

It's a hard game to put down when you first buy it, and even after that new game euphoria is gone the immersiveness of the soundtrack, artwork, and intensity of battles is enough to keep it fun. Everything is customizable to your choosing, from the appearance and names of your party members to their skills and gear. Items are hugely varied with a great many serving specific purposes for strategem oriented players. It's beautiful watching your play-by-play work out and truly horrifying when it doesn't. All your men are expendable, although it may not feel that way, and as long as you can keep money and food on stand by you're still in business. 

Quests and enemies are currently slightly repetitive, but as the game is updated I expect more and more additions to be made until it would be scarce to find one in the same encounter. 

Gear and customization is currently at a very acceptable amount for an RPG, I would think the developers will add more items as the game progresses.

What this game does not currently have is any storyline and no multiplayer. I believe the developers are crafting a main storyline for the player to follow along if they so choose to, but at it's base this game will always be a sandbox RPG. No idea if multiplayer is a planned feature or not, but I wouldn't think it's a longshot considering battles are turnbased.

It's a classical medieval fantasy setting. You are a leader of group of mercenaries. You need to move your brothers forward and find glory and wealth. You start with 3 brothers (men). You can hire new teammates up to 20 people, but only 12 can participate in a battle.

So, you move between cities, get contracts and execute them. There are several types of contracts: 1) wait and defend 2) find an enemy near and kill 3) go to certain point of the map and kill 4) move a cargo to the city 5) escort caravan and etc.
You need to fight with enemies very often. If your brother will fall in the battle he will be dead. The death is permanent. 
So you need to think wisely to prevent your troops from dying.

The combat system has several parameters. There is a lot of nuances, so it's easier to play and look. I can say, I liked it.

The game offers a full freedom of choices. There is no main story, you just play and can see certain events. There is a crisis come at 70-100 day. It is kinda a challenge. But after that, the game continues.

I liked a lot my first 15 hours of the gameplay. So much to learn, so much to loot. After that (Day 45), I realized that the game doesn't bring new joy for me. Same enemies with better armor. Same contracts with higher numbers. A lot of save/load... and I stopped playing, but I don't regret a purchase.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1485632050
Pros
- Cool gameplay and visual mechanics with units as chessman. Units have only Body and Head armor and 1 slot for a weapon. It's like a casual version of hardcore tactics games.
- Combat mechanics is slightly different from classic TBS games. It is interesting to learn it.
- The graphics is very good. I like this minimalistic style. 2d art is also awesome
- I liked the idea with buy/sell stuff. There is a lot of types and levels of weapons. You will find new items every hour of the game.
- Leveling up and perk systems of brothers are well done.
- The game is replayable duo high random factor

Cons
- The game is endless. You can play until you get bored. There is no actual story.
- The game doesn't bring new content during the game. There are the same abilities, enemies, but with better armor. So it could get boring after a few cool days of the gameplay
- No auto-battle feature
- The game has a lot of random factors, so be ready to save/load very often

Just found out a whole DLC is on it's way and that means that the game is still supported by the devs. In light of that I am changing my recommendation and I am installing it (up to now I've been hot seating it with my bro).

""EDIT 01""
Although my old review of the game stands regarding the announcement of the developers that they will move on to a new game, in the meanwhile they provided a free DLC (and bug fixing patches as they have promised).

So although I still would not reccomend it, I would suggest that you watch a few youtube videos and decide if you like what it offers (I believe you can can enjoy it, just do not expect major improvements/additions, although that free DLC show otherwise!).

In case the developers continue to add stuff ingame and provide bugfixes I will definitely change my review to positive.


""OLD REVIEW""
The game devs just announced they stopped further development and they are moving on to their next game. That's after a grand total of 3 months after release (end of March 2017 - mid June 2017).

This smells like a moneygrab scheme that is hiding behind the ""we released the game, play it as it is tyvm"" theme counting on early access sales to justify their existence.

68,44011843,english,"So, my friend made fun of me for buying this game because he said it had flash-game graphics. 

While the general graphics are pretty simple, they are well done and I think look great. 
I am actually glad that the game isn't packed full for heavy and normally glitchy 3d graphics.
They are not pixelated, and give no feeling of 'I drew these up in MS.Paint on my lunchbreak'. 
With that said, the graphics, which I like, are maybe the worst part of this amazing game.

 The game itself has a very simple feel to it. I almost felt like I had played it before. For me it has an oddly powerful immersion factor. The combat is very strategic and though it uses some rng mechanics, it has rarely if ever felt like I was not entirely in-control of the outcome. I easy become very attached to my mercenaries which is not a good thing in this game, as yes, they will probably die. A lot will die. There was a couple hail marys where rng let me down, and I would scream as the goblins wolfriders ate my brothers. But would always end up feeling more like ""I should have not run him forward"" Or why didn't i use shieldwall instead of the long shot attack, instead of screaming about the RNG screwing me (which is a much more common feeling in XCOM). 

I guess this is a bit of a ramble. But, this has been a surprisingly great game! Never heard of it before seeing it in steam discovery(?) queue. I am not much of an impulse buyer but this game has certainly been worth what I paid for it. 
Cheers to the devs for focusing on the meat of the game and not just frills.

Though it is turn based I always find myself so rushed to make my turns even though there is no timer. There's also just that impetus to kill those bad guys before they can get their hits in. The game does have permadeath, which is always annoying when a guy you liked dies in battle. The game does autosave before battles so you can reload and try again, but it is always annoying. Sometimes your guys won't die they'll just get a critical wound and function less better than they had been, also annoying, but realistic sure.

Lots of armour and weapons to choose from, though the game could certainly have more. Time between turns generally didn't feel annoying unless you were supporting an ally in which case you had to wait through their moves. Then in the late game there are some epic battles that take a long time. I always wished that the loot from battles was better. I mean sure people don't want to wear bloody armour, but it's free! 

Just as I soon as I thought there wouldn't be any extra DLC content I see that they've actually starting to put out one, that'll certainly be worth looking into. I've certainly gotten a lot of hours out of it, and likely those that like to come back to play games over again, will like this game. There's not a linear story more just random missions that you agree to do. Then eventually the final missions that are a lot harder than anything you faced before.

With all these squad based games I'm always annoyed when there's a restrictions of dudes you can field at a time, in this game it was 12, which really wasn't so bad. But if the bad guys can field more troops it always begs the question why you can't you? It's merely a game restriction not a reality restriction. If you can hire up to 18 and if you come up to a life or death situation you would field all 18 not just 12 because the other six don't feel like it. Certainly begs the issue of when do you stop deploying troops and that would all depend on the amount of money you're raking in from missions. If you're sitting on 10,000 gold pieces and 18 men, you could certainly develop a larger band. I realize this would create balancing issues, but the enemy could always start to scale up too. Though it would definitely make those turns drag on for longer.

74,35937080,english,"I really, really, REALLY wish there was NEUTRAL option for leaving reviews. This game is definitely in the bittersweet/neutral review category.

My biggest complaint with this game is that it feels like an unadorned shell of a game. If you're familiar with strategy title gurus, Paradox Interactive, it feels like one of their games on release - which is to say that the game is perfectly functional,  but the experience is completely vapid like the developers were planning on making the base game a vehicle for future expansions & DLC. Unfortunately, however, the developers of Battle Brothers have flat-out said that they have zero intention of ever working on the game again beyond bug fixing and balancing. They've even explained that the game would be too difficult to change to allow modding.

As far as the experience you get while playing the game as is now...well, prepare for a campaign in redundancy. You have your mercenary band, travel from point of interest to settlements, take contracts, hire new mooks, buy/sell supplies, go to contract destination, fight enemies, complete contract (or not), rinse and repeat.

- There are simply not enough events to keep things interesting
- The UI is clunky and ugly
- Other than tooltips, there isn't some kind of economy screen that gives detailed breakdowns of expenses - resources (food, tools, ammo, medical supplies) consumed per day
- The end-game crises are unoriginal and uninteresting
- There isn't enough variation in the game (map, enemies, events, contracts, gear, trading, gameplay options, ect,)
- The battle map has no way to rotate, so good luck placing your troops in the correct hex, not to mention determining if the elevation is going to work in your favor
- Pray to RNGesus
- No modding
- Not enough and no new content (READ: expansions)
- No diplomacy
- No economic game (other than buy from X, sell to Y). Sorta counter-intuitive when you are controlling a merc band...
- End-game crises are bland. It's like ending a long-term relationship with you significant other over dinner with the dollar menu at McDonalds
- The music and ambient noises (especially in settlements) are repetitve AF! There seems to be only one track that plays regardess of the size or situation of the settlement you frequent.

********

Despite the negative points I've collated, the game IS relatively fun at times. There have been numerous analogies comparing Battle Brothers to the like of XCOM. That's mostly faulty. Battle Brothers is more in the vein of Final Fantasy Tactics, Tactics Ogre, Disgaea in terms of the tactical battles and the 3/4 birds-eye view of the world map. I very much enjoy tactics RPGs, and seeing that Battle Brothers definitely fits that bill, it would follow that I also enjoy Battle Brothers. I do and have enjoyed this title, but there was a definitely threshold that was breached where the repetition became too annoying to tune out and the newness wore off to show mediocrity.

78,43912676,english,"TLDR: Incredible game, one of my all time favourites. I talk about the strong and weakpoints briefly and then add a 34 minute video link for more detailed explanations.

Battle Brothers doesn't look like much graphically at first, which is probably the main reason it is not vastly more popular.
Other downsides include that its only singleplayer, that RNG can screw you hard and that there are a few minor issues that I personally dislike, like not being able to see the stats of mercs before you hire them, which makes for some awkward ""I just paid you, now please go away again"" moments.

Apart from that it is simply incredible. Be it the importance of equipment and the way you asess your enemies by looking not at their stats but at what they are actually wearing and wielding (more games need to do that, phoenix point already plans to) or be it how alive the map feels. Im not talking about nicely placed NPCs, it's more like you are looking at a terrarium, contained within itself there are cities trading with each other, bandits attacking caravans and patrols, orcs burning down smaller settlements, etc. Its all randomized and whatever story you have to tell from your latest game, the best ones are usually unscripted and just happened by chance, which feels incredible. Like that one time when I managed to trick an army of orcs and an army of brigands that were both chasing me into fighting each other? As they started to fight my men turned around and reengaged and slaughtered them both whille otherwise each of the two factions would have been a hard nut to crack. Felt incredible.

82,33795564,english,"Excelent turn-based strategy/rpg game. You play as the leader of a mercenary company in a medieval world. Your company aims to be renowed in the world and you are the man to lead it to. You hire mercenaries, get weapons and equipment for you company, pick jobs and try to stay alive. It is a wonderful game that the only drawback is that it is very difficult to keep alive.
I am playing for more than 90 hours and could not pass from 65 days game time without being exterminated. There are basically five types of enemies: human brigands, orcs, goblins, undead and savage monsters. Until you reach 1000 points of renown the game goes smoothly, but then the missions become very difficult.
If you are having trouble in the beggining here goes some tips:
1. Try to hire people of the right professions: caravan hands, ex-soldiers, hunters, farm hands, ... Do not hire taylors, bureaucrats, and other peaceful professions. The developers for sure read Vegetius manual.
2. Unzoom the map to find the current objective. It is much easier to find your objective this way.
3. To scroll the map, you have to unmark the follow the unit marker.
4. Hire at least 3 archers/missile brothers. Its is easier to win the battles with them.
5. Start with the objective of become friendly with a civil faction.

Have fun. It is a wonderful game to play while XCOM 3 has not arrived.

UPDATE AFTER MORE THAN 300 HOURS: Finally I reached the end of a campaign, and it is very difficult to win, but it is so fun to play that you cannot stop. I won the Greenskin campaing in easy difficulty. I do not know if it is possible to win in the veteran difficulty, but I will try.

The challenge in the game in the short term relies on winning battles without taking too many losses (you will lose guys, especially the really good ones). Long term the challenge is about building a mercenary company that can take on increasingly hard challenges, that means cultivating a strong roster of brothers, with thoughtful perk selections as they level up, as well as aquiring increasingly good gear for them. 

The only negative I have to say gameplay-wise is that it can get repetitive in the late game. Also the developers consider it complete, so there likely won't be any more content coming for it. Which is extremely sad, because it has all the things it needs to be a great core that could have been built upon. Lack of mod support also robs us of potentially limitless possibilities for content, which feels like such a missed opportunity.

Patience; You need to be careful and think several moves ahead in order to try and anticipate what the AI is gonna do next. 

Management; You earn money! But midday, everyday, your wonderful band of merry mercenarys (some more merry than others, yes, I'm looking at you Gerulf the Drunk) need paying. Some need more than others depending on a variety of things including level, background or if they're just plain greedy (Yes that is a quirk a character can have).

Cursing; Yes, you will curse. Especially when your crossbowman you've been leveling proceeds to miss on a 90% hit chance. (You have everything to apologise for, Hartmut). 

In general; the names of cities, towns, villages, enemies and other undiscovered locations appear to be German influenced. I mean, a group of ghouls slowly fading into your partys view line to slash your swordsman into jerky or swallow your spearman whole doesn't have quite the same ring as ""A group of NACHZEHRERS are coming!""

Zombies are soooooo last year. But Wiedergangers and Armoured Wiedergangers are a different story. And the Wiedergangers keep coming back, with 50% of their HP as long as they are not beheaded or if the local creepy Necromancer is nearby to assist them. And they always have more HP than your merry mercs have. 

The flavour of this game in general is gritty, bloody, dark with a light seasoning of ""Oh bollocks. Time to make a new company.""

How you ask? There is even a ""Retire"" option in the main menu ingame! Sometimes, depending on how prestigious your company is, you get some flavour text as well. More prestigious your company is, depends on whether or not someone from your company takes up the mantle of Captain and proceeds to do a horrible job. Always.

89,43734269,english,"I want to write a review for this game as i've very recently observed a whole bunch of people very angrily berating the devs for 'abandoning' this game. The game is not abandoned. It is finished and well worth your money.

I'll jump straight in to the meat of it. There are, in my opinion, three pillars that make or break a game. The story, the gameplay and the design.

There are two stories in this game, in a sense. The first is the story of your company, its members and the interactions and battles they face. Each game has new mercenaries, new contacts, new cities and new emerging sandbox elements. It's a little barebones in the sense that the mercenaries don't develop their own stories with one another, simply having a heavy morale drop when a fellow mercenary falls in the pursuit of wealth. Deeper interaction between your mercenaries would absolutely have made the game one of my all time favourites.

The first story is below the surface. Revealed to you over time with bits of information, a story of a grand empire long since gone to dust and a world of increasing poverty and death. A grand empire and it's emperor, now reborn.

The gameplay is excellent, deep and hard. The depth of the gameplay comes from the mercenaries stats, the perks but most importantly, the equipment they use. Rather then learning and upgrading skills and having them forever a mercenary is only able to use the skills that are tied to a specific weapon. A hunting bow having Quick Shot (letting you fire twice) plus Aimed shot (Letting you fire once with increased accuracy) and a crossbow only having Fire for example. Certain weapons have certain skills, the more exotic the weapon, the more exotic the skill. Learning what these skills do as well as when and where you should apply them is essential. I could go further in to detail however a big part of the fun is the learning curve.

The hardness of the gameplay comes from the AI which is quite damn good. The AI reacts with appropriate tactics to whatever you are doing. Are you a superior force attacking with archers? The AI locks up and performs a shieldwall with its own archers responding. It won't move until you do something different, as staying defensive and getting lucky with defensive skills is its best chance of beating you. 
Are you on the run from a larger force and in a bad position? Expect to get flanked or outmaneuvered.
The AI is reactive to what you do but won't hesitate to go on the offensive if it can punish you. Its great!

Now the best part of this game is the design. The map and artwork is beautiful, the story is simple enough but engaging nonetheless. Its got great sound design as well. Nothing better then being ambushed by adult Orcs and have them charge your line screaming their heads off.

This game IS turnbased and uses a hex-tile system of movement. If its not your thing, its not your thing. I seriously recommend playing on normal for about an hour just to get a feel then immediately restart and up the difficulty setting. You will lose, a lot, yet victory will be all the more sweeter for it.

A lot of love went in to this game, don't believe the angry reviews claiming its abandoned. It hasn't sold well and it really should have.",1532515571,1532515571,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198006750633,317,17,6827,0,3068,1592029904,,

Battle Brothers is a rather brutal tactical/strategical RPG with roguelike elements. You lead a ragtag band of mercenaries and try to make it successful by fighting bandits, orcs, and undeads. All the enemies, even the most inane ones, are a plausible deadly threat (it takes only one lucky hit and your guys are done, especially at the beginning): the only way to survive is to kill them before they kill you. It's even more fun if you play ironman (i.e. no savescum option on).

Expect many losses: they will make the taste of victory all the sweeter. Except when it's one of your good guys. Losing the good guys isn't very fun: that's why there's cannon fodder.

As a seasoned veteran games with pale skin that usualy plays on the 0.1% to 0,01% tier of players,
i hearly suggest this  game IF. AND ONLY IF you can cope with fact that RNG is going to destroy you sometimes.

#TL;DR
Positive:
-A top tier execution on creating a band of Battle Brothers, with interesting gear choices, talent options.
-There is allot of things to engage from trade, questing, relations with faction, exploration...
Negative:
-Players skill is more of a suggestion to RNG system what it should do, but RNG system doesn't care what you think.
-Battle mechanic which is it's greatest downfall in my honest opinion.


Here is my reasoning:
#1-Uncontrolable RNG.
You can have 1000hours playtime, IQ level of a mastermind, know everything about the game, and get absolutely destroyed by RNG in battles with close to 0 control over it.
And this is a game where consequences motter highly.

THAT is where my issue lies, I MY SELF cannot influence the battles.
""Yea...Yea... bunch of gibberish, you can tactically position your troops blablabla""
^
If above is your statement, i agree. Here is my argument:

 I am comming from ironman mode on all medium difficuly.
And just to get viped by Brigand Thugs when i defeated Brigand Thugs groups like 10 times, without even taking ANY damage.
To a situation where we start a battle 10v8.
I retreat all my units to have high ground, and i have favourable 3 tile choke.
Frontline setup: 3 units with Spear/mace+shield(level ~4-5)
Midline setup: two handed axes(level ~4-5)
Backline setup: 2 crossbows 2 archers

I blow out first 6 enemies as they walk in one hit, as usual. But little did i know, there is a CHUCK NORRIS, and a halucination of cthulhu next to him.
With stats like ""High ground, Surround, every unit had the 8% additional hit chance per miss talent""
My morale was high since we killed enemies, and enemy morale was low.
SO THEORICALLY AND TACTICALLY... my chance to hit and dodge are high, and enemies are VERY LOW.

SO WHAT CHUCK NORIS skinned as Brigand Thug said. And got hit like 1time out of 20 attacks on him, meanwhile didn't miss a single attack and killed 2 of my units with armors on chest with like 130-150 and head 105-115, and talents with additional hp, and every level up on them i put ""melee evasion, hp, and last was best stat i could get""
I even pulled my archers to go behind them so i get more hit chance cause they ran out of arrows at this point.

For this reasion, that there are no soft gaps on evasion/dodging/blocking. 
OR SOME KIND OF ENTROPY SYSTEM, to prevent a trash unit going berserk cause RNG is reason why i will downvote it.

""But this doesn't happen so often, and is not a big issue"" 
Yea...Yea... When a estimate of game gives me 86%-92% on every attack and between 4 units i miss ALL of their attacks, i think there is a fukin issue.
OH YEA, he didn't even have a helmet, just lether armour, and when i hit him finally with two handed axe he took like 10% to body armour i almost broke my keyboard, the axe tooltip is 40-70 if i remember correctly... and his lether armour was 50 armor points....",1532201720,1532201720,True,4,5,0.502699136734008789,0,True,False,False,76561198310084322,91,19,1599,0,1196,1545511860,,

It says characters will die and they do but sometimes it doesnt seem out of fairness, I had a healthy no debuffs character at lvl 3 that only had 60% chance odds of hitting a man with no sheild and only basic armour and this guy straight up kills me with hits to my head when I couldnt touch him. Comparing that to another hard game like DD (Darkest Dungeon) which are different, but i feel like in DD it gives you a chance with trinkets and buffs, and even debuffs to accuracy in DD ive only seen go as low as a 64 ish% chance to hit and ive played DD alot. However this game is still good, made well in what it does and its supposed to be hard they tell you up front it is, so I recommend it. Its a mix of Mount and Blade and Turn based combat and it does both pretty well.

Edit: I played 2 or 3 more hours than i did when i wrote this and i have to change my recommendation. The odds to hit are just so stacked against you it seems. While normally its just 50-50 or lower you can get it up into the 70-80% range and it still misses just as much. The enemies hit you more than you hit them, like all the moves they have that should be the same % as yours just seem to hit you at least 2x more often. I talked about that before but its just too much, after 2-3 hours of CONSTANTLY missing 70- 80% hits and dying to enemies that have more initiative than me (just means they are always faster) is bullshit.

A gritty, low-fantasy, medieval mercenary sandbox simulator with turn-based tactical combat, Battle Brothers has you, the ""Captain"", leading the disgruntled remains of your mercenary company after a pyrrhic victory. In order to make ends meet, you travel from place to place, offering your men and their swords for coin, buying new hands and blades when there is gold to spare, and battling (or fleeing from) brigands, direwolves, orcs and other ""undesireables"" where they emerge.
[On the low-fantasy bit: There is little magic in the game, but more importantly, it is never accessible to you. However, the emphasis is on medieval-style tactics with a peppering of skirmishing, so there is no worry of your men being hopelessly outgunned by a magic-bolting mage.]

The strategic layer occurs on the world map, which sees you and your company travelling between settlements and other locations. It is primarily a juggling act between several resources, although your primary resource will be gold by a large margin. While shuffling tradegoods between settlements earns you a pretty penny, completing mercenary contracts for local bigwigs will earn you the most (though not necessarily the easiest) coin. And they will offer a variety of contracts, but given the nature of your company it will almost always involve the murdering of some bunch of things or another. Thankfully, the writing in this game is done well, which lessens the tedium and repetitiveness a tad.

The other main resource you have to handle is your mercs themselves, and they have a number of characteristics which serve to define them and their role in your company: their background and history, traits (which set them apart from their fellow men), attributes (abstracted combat stats such as hitpoints and melee skill), and perks (a.k.a. ""skills"", which they pick every level from a common perk tree). Besides determining whether a merc will eventually become the next ""Whirling Vortex of DOOM"" or ""Urist McBodyshield II"", these also play a role in how random events pan out; Havard Smartypants might decide on a whim to impart some wit to Bubba the Dumb, or Jann the monk may intercede on your behalf to convince a slaver that ""wildmen lives matter too!"". These may or may not provide any tangible benefit to your company, but they certainly do inject a dose of flavor to your mercs, and provide a direction for your own narrative to develop.

Where Battle Brothers truly excels, however, is the combat - and it is glorious.

Upon encountering an enemy force on the world map, you are brought to the battle map, wherein you will find the two forces facing off against each other on a hex-grid: your mercs on the left, the adversaries on the right. Combat then proceeds in turns, whereby characters will act in order of their initiative, and they can choose to either move, attack, perform a skill, or wait to act again at the end of the same turn; except for waiting, all of these cost action points (APs), and each character typically has 9 APs, allowing them to move 4 grids or perform 2 actions generally. Typical turn-based tactical fare mostly.

What is truly impressive, however, is the amount of effort put into balancing the various aspects of combat. Firstly, the weapons are reasonably diverse yet very well-developed, as each weapon has its own forte, allowing you multiple ways to adapt to your enemies. Shield on your enemy? Break it with axes or bypass it with flails. Tons of armor? Batter it down with hammers, puncture through it with daggers, or school it with a good ol' two-handed axe. Rarely will any single weapon type outclass another completely, nor will any one type become completely obsolete. Secondly, the common perk tree is well-balanced, with few to no useless perks all around; other players have made great use of some perks that I rarely use. Thirdly, the enemy factions each have their own set of tactics, which are both very effective on the unprepared, and also fits well with their lore - humans pepper you with missiles in formation, direwolves charge at you in a frenzy, orcs smash through your frontlines, and goblins? Damn goblins. Anyway, all these together means that combat is a wonderful affair; nothing feels better than a well-prepared (well-informed?) band of mercs tearing a good one in the enemies' forces, or turning a losing battle into a winning one due to the smart use of terrain, perks, and weapon mechanics. Additionally, combat is lethal and dangerous (as it should be), and the ever-looming threat of losing a valuable merc within a turn or two due to mistakes and/or bad luck helps keep battles intense and engaging.

It is unfortunate, then, that the intricate and robust combat mechanics are rather obscure, and that the game fails to provide precise information on how damage is calculated; the damage mechanics of Split Man (on two-handed axes) is one of the biggest offenders here, where the tool-tip fails to inform and may even mislead. For a game where a single mistake can be the difference between overwhelming victory or utter defeat, it would have been prudent for the devs to have provided such information in a readily-accessible location. As it stands, the new player will either have to go in blind, or scour through forums for the information they need.

Finally, it should be noted that the random number generator (RNG) in this game is rather controversial. You might miss several 80% (or even 90+%) hit-chance attacks in a row, while enemy crossbow bolts always seem to find a way to your favorite merc's face... which gives the impression that the RNG is biased to favor enemies. Much can be said here, but suffice it to say that this impression is wholly psychological (after all, there will always be times when your crippled merc somehow manages to behead two enemies in one turn). XCOM players might remark that the RNG in Battle Brothers feels ""worse"" than XCOM's; and that is true, but that is because Firaxis had inflated hit-chances in XCOM to ""better fit player expectations of randomness"". In short, the RNG in Battle Brothers favors no one in the long run - not you, not that orc berserker snickering in your merc's visor, not that arbalester raining death on your company.

TL;DR:
Robust and satisfying turn-based tactical medieval combat, with a less-developed strategic overlay (think XCOM with fewer strategic elements). High replayability due to random generation of maps, but hampered by lack of modding support. RNG  (esp. those related to hit-chance) is fair, but may deter or frustrate.

Pros:
++ Combat is very tactical and hugely satisfying
++ Well-balanced assortment of weapons
++ Many viable ways to develop a merc; builds are versatile and flexible
++ Enemy factions have characteristic and identifiable tactics
+ Great deal of replayability
+ Seeded maps allow for sharing/replaying favorite maps
+ Good writing
+ Random events add personality to mercs

Cons:
- Lack of proper tutorials, some obscure mechanics
- Steep learning curve (could be a plus for some)
- RNG can be beyond frustrating at times
- Restricted company size (max. 20 mercs, incl. 12 fielded)
- Limited late-game content past the first crisis (avg. session designed to last ~100 in-game days)
-- No modding support

Turn-based tactics veterans could consider starting on Veteran difficulty (since many of the combat mechanics are probably intuitive to them), but should refer to a guide. Beginners should always start on Beginner difficulty, unless they do not mind learning by having their ass handed to them. Recommended for everyone to switch to Ironman mode on preferred difficulty after 3-5 sessions for best gameplay experience.",1531344253,1531344364,True,2,0,0.512534797191619873,0,True,False,False,76561198014723791,586,5,25905,0,4863,1600285033,,

Pros
- rewarding feeling after wining a big battle even sometimes when you lose half of your men.
- Complex strategic Loot system yes there is a stategy for looting items off dead enemys.
- No ALFA builds most games have a 1 way beats all this game does not 
- game really pushes you to plan out how your gonna progress or win battle to battle
- the game kinda ends when you want it to end allowing a retire feature
Cons
- retireing is utterly pointless no future gain for retiring ledgendary Battle Bros I wish there was a option to Reinlist some of my nice Hard work from previous games onto the next maybe not keep the gear just the bros
- No Item crafting system when you have Items that can be used for crafting Like Iorn and wood or rare gems 
- Rare item Loot is very hard to find in some seeds when in others for no reason you can almost see a drop every couple battles
- No Steam workshop Lack of content and if you want 3rd party edit tools well we all know how that is
- Late game random glitch where a guy who has clearly no chance to hit a brother that lands a few hits one after another killing him which doesnt make since in late game because you have 60 or so melee defense and he just plows you :(

In just a handful of (failed) campaigns and 200 days in game, my men have been beheaded, gutted, poisoned, devoured, stabbed, cut, skewered, and shot. Entire companies have been slaughtered. We've run out of money, starved, gotten lost in the woods and ambushed by goblins, and so many, many other disasters.

Battle Brothers is a hardcore tactical strategy game. You maneuver your band of merry corpses-to-be on the battlefield, taking out direwolves and brigands for money.

Combat is deep and complex. There are many options for customization. Enemies are varied and have smart AI that constantly keeps you on your toes.

So, with all that great stuff, why am I conflicted about recommending this game to you?

Well... Battle Brothers is a little bit hard.

Actually, it's brutally, crushing difficult. This is a game that will tear you to shreds for the slightest mistake. You will be massacred for any tactical or economic misstep.

Poor gear? Dead.

Not enough men? Dead.

Bad positioning? Really dead.

And that's all on BEGINNER difficulty!!

I can't even imagine what this game is like on the higher difficulties.

Anyway, after ~12 hours with the game, I think I need a little time off from this game. I'll come back to it from time to time and gradually learn it. Hopefully it will click eventually, because there's a lot of great stuff in here.

17,43196533,english,"[i]Battle Brothers[/i] is a godsend for any lover of hardcore group-oriented tactical combat. There's no unnecessary fluff, no story to get in the way; just a band of mercenaries to manage (you'll need to choose your battles right if you want to make sure your team has enough resources to keep fixing armor and healing) and tough tactical fights to prevail in.

It's not without its downsides, of course. [i]Battle Brothers[/i] goes for realism, so the visuals can get kind if muddy. You'll also spend a lot of time micromanaging items, because good armor matters more than experienced units in this one, which is, I guess, another attempt at realism. 

I'm not sure if it reaches the desired goal, but what matters is, it results in truly evocative gameplay.

Even the best shield, you see, only protects a soldier from the front, making positioning crucial in battle. You want to smash opponents' shields with heavy weapons, while at the same time flanking them with lighter units who can't break through defences so easily; and, of course, they want to do the same to you. Fights become even more fun as soon as terrain and height come into play, making it so that good positioning can turn the tide of battle completely.

I also liked the random generation aspect. The game is quite hard even without ironman, you see; however, each time you reload a battle, it randomises slightly (while retaining enemy type and level of toughness). Due to that, save-scumming doesn't actually become a chore, since each time the situation is slightly different (and that also prevents the player from just learning and abusing the particular patterns of their opponents).

40,42881574,english,"Run a mercenary company in Middle Ages fantasy not-Germany.  What could possibly go wrong?

Oh yeah, everything, from the first mission on.  Battle Brothers is a fairly grueling life of a mercenary simulator with solid tactical depth and fairly meaningful choices.  It also features a tough but fair RNG that puts players and enemies on an equal footing, something fairly rare in modern Strategy games.

That said, most of the negative reviews are complaints about ""RNG"" and ""too difficult on easy.""  Some things you should be aware of - different weapons have different statistics.  Spears give a to hit bonus and flails ignore shields - making them good choices early on when you're running around with pig farmers.  Shields give you defence even when not in a shield wall, making them essential early on.  Two handed axes hit twice, once on the head and once on the body, meaning that they can do a ton of damage but will also destroy the enemies armor and helmet, so that's less loot for you.

Finally, enemies progress - bandits, for example, go from thugs - raiders - leaders - heros - named guys, and poachers - hunters - marksmen.  Each progression means better gear AND better stats, so if you've got level 2 guys in cloth shirts with crappy daggers you aren't ready to take on more than 1 bandit raider/marksman.  Be observant and this game isn't that difficult, but it punishes you quickly for overextending or not paying attention.

Enemy behavior and tactics are also fairly predictable in terms of when they will advance, how they will do so, and when they will just turtle and use range.

Your opponents will run into the same issue a full two thirds less often than you will resulting in a surrounded enemy managing to kill a unit or two before being defeated.

51,42518668,english,"Battle Brothers is a sandbox, tactical, turn based, dice roll RPG set in a low medieval fantasy setting.  I discovered this gem a while back and I got quickly addicted to its game mechanics.  I really loved building my Hawk Band and felt serious tension each time I engaged other foes.  I can't praise enough how great this game is, and I really hope to see a sequel or other creative settings/games from Overhype Studios.

Pros:
+ The turn-based tactical combat can be harsh and punishing at first.  But damn, it is so good.
+ Building a band of refugees, farmers, brawlers, bastards...  and damn it feels so rewarding, when that weak apprentice you hired 115 days ago becomes a fearsome Orc slayer!!  And damn how stressed you are to lose him in battle (in the hardcore mode where you got one auto save).
+ Different type of enemies with different approaches.  You CAN'T expected to use one strategy to beat the undeads, orcs, human, and goblins.  You always need to adapt and even have different plans...  And even when you adapt, you can get destroyed by unfavorable terrain or weather conditions.
+ Weapons feel quite different and offer many approaches to combat.
+ I liked the perks system, although some perks feel pretty useless compared to others.
+ Fun sandbox world that is randomly generated every time you start a new campaign.
+ 3 main end game crises that are very interesting.
+ The price point, I bought it for less than $30.00 and sank over 300 hours in this game (of which at least 200 hours were great fun).

Cons:
- I would have loved better story lines or events.
- Bad RNG can be very very unforgiving...  But I guess it is part of what makes this game so much fun...  The tension!!

I had so many ideas to improve the game with for additional events, gameplay tweaks and gameplay additions...  But I thought to myself: ""Dude, remember that this is an indy game sold for less than $30.00 and it surpasses many triple A $60.00 games.  You can't expect the moon and the stars, haha!""

53,42472391,english,"I really really really enjoy this game. It's brutally difficult and it has a lot of the things I love about Mount & Blade. I'll probably even keep playing it because of the setting and I want to see what end-game looks like.

That being said, this game is full of shit. This game's depth is there but not as deep as it pretends to be.

It keeps being compared to X-COM, but in X-COM you always have the chance of winning if you strategize and use cover well. Even when you have a team of rookies with 30-something chance to hit, you can still win. Especially because as time goes on your characters get useful, unique abilities that make them stand out from each other.

This game relies on luck far more heavily than strategy. Don't get me wrong, there absolutely IS strategy involved, but when 12 of my characters miss all their double-attacks I'm calling bullshit. Especially when the ENTIRE team of enemies don't miss a SINGLE attack against my shield wall and its alleged ""defense bonus"".

The ""Resolve"" stat decides if your character gets scared and flees a battle. An interesting concept, but what it means in practice is my full-health character in a fight I'm WINNING may decide to start running away and get insta-killed by his adjacent enemies who get a free attack. Basically the computer rolls to decide if one of my characters randomly dies on their turn. You won't get attached to your characters because no matter how badass and strong they are, no matter how much you've calculated and googled their ideal armor/weapon build, skills and their fatigue/health, they'll still be killed by completely random chance.

You'll stop reading ANY of the pages of decent  storywriting because it just gets copypasted between every NPC. There's no DLC incoming so don't hope for any new content, and eventually you'll see that every encounter becomes pretty much the same.

And you'll keep playing because idk the concept is really cool and it's fun to build up your small band of surviving badasses, and the battles where you BARELY survive are a lot more exciting than the ones where you effortlessly kick the enemy's ass through their bad dice rolls.

TL;DR  A game that pretends to be deep but ultimately boils down mostly to random chance. More like Pit People than XCOM, with the overworld UI of Mount and Blade. Thirty bucks is really steep for a game that could use more content and isn't getting updates, get it while it's on-sale and try it out and get addicted to it like I did.

Your men level up, gain skills, and can be outfitted with a variety of weapons and armor, each with their own unique stats so nothing is really ""useless"" and you can fit guys out for certain ""jobs"" like ranged or tank. 

The stragey itch is truely satisfied in this game as positioning of your men and morale are big in this game as height, weapons, shields, armor types, and the amount of enemies surrounding you (or you around the enemy) will effect the stats, both positive and negative, for engagements.   

Each town and character is unique as every game is randomly generated. They actually WEAR the armor and weapons into battle, so you can see what each person has AND it makes it easy to loot your fallen enemies!

Highly reccommend playing on easy the first time so you can learn and get into the late game events. Then once you're familair with the game go into harder modes. The RNG is truely unforgiving in the harder modes.

You are the commander of a mercenary company, you were a part of said company, but that was before your own previous leader made a very poor life decision and got you and your group maimed. You and your two companions now head back to town to receive payment for killing off the bandits, after all, you did kill them before you lost most of your force.

You now walk upon orc parties laughing hartily as the savages fall to your Hedge Knight Sir Holdrik, and his immense power of destruction. You scoff at the marksmen that once seemed daunting, picking away at your men; but your Huntsman Wilbur The Odd, now draws his bow with utter assurance that his arrow shall pierce his enemies.

Each and every fight can poke at their eyes, sprain their ankles, effect their state of mind or leave them hobbled or dead. There is almost no magic or technology, and most towns don't have a healer, so you won't be healing that broken leg. You'll have to make tough decissions about how injured someone can be and still keep them on the team, and when you'll  abandon your best injured archer to a crippled life of poverty.    

You are a very small part of a large living world that doesn't care about you and will go on without you. The world has politics between large factions that are flawed and unlikable, you'll make alliances of convenience and work for people you'd rather not.  There are large scale wars and disasters far beyond your control, cities and countries will rise and fall into ruin around you while you're just escorting caravans or hunting bandits.  

This all makes it all the more enjoyable when your men level up and grow into a powerful band of brothers with close knit ties and shared experiences. Eventually your company will collect full sets of armour and occassionally find rare and powerful weapons, until finally you're facing down fearsome orc invastions, plagues of undead and the armies of other kingdoms.

What is Battle Brothers?

In terms of gameplay, it's a rogue-like melee-based XCOM set in a depressing medieval fantasy setting.

To describe it well, allow me to take you on a quick tour of my first couple hours.

[b]* * * * * MY EXPERIENCE * * * * *[/b]
You begin the game with a merry band of worn-out, battle-weary men. More ""Band of Brothers"" than ""Robin Hood."" In my case, I had a group of layabouts who couldn't use a weapon if their lives depended on it. (It did. And they didn't make it.)

Once you make it out of the brief combat tutorial, you're tasked with a fairly simple mission: get your mercenary company back on it's feet, and slaughter the weasel who reduced your once-great company to the original Three Stooges. That's the setting, but once you're truly thrust into this world, things get a little more complicated.

In any case, my first ""real"" contract (your ""missions"" in this game) was given to me by Roland the Merchant, a rather insane stereotype of a rich person. The flavor text was pretty fun: some poor peasant was being beaten with a stick or some such sport, and a shady man directed my party to meet with Roland for a job. Surprisingly, there was no option to join in on beating up the peasant, so I glumly set off to meet my future employer. 

The meeting with Roland immersed me in the world quite well, if the tutorial did not. Roland was a fat man with a lot of money. He talked about money, and thumbed his nose at us dirty sellswords (who had very little money). Roland's first question was pretty simple: ""Have you ever lost something you loved?"" I replied, ""There once was this girl..."" But Roland cut me off, saying, ""No, you idiot, something valuable, not some girl!""

In the end, I never got to relate my tale of lost love, but I did receive the promise of 500 coins for retrieving Roland's merchandise. After hiring a depressed peddler to round out the company, I set on my way to kill Roland's enemies and wrong the wrongs of the world. I found the bandits running along the road, and tried to give them what for.

It turned out I had absolutely no clue what I was doing. I had three untalented archers, a front-liner with no shield, one dimwit with a spear, and one incredibly competent wildman. I ended up reloading the battle about 10 times, realizing that I had bitten off more than I could chew but not exactly understanding what I was doing wrong as time after time two of my men would end up bloody, lifeless husks on the cruel battlefield. Eventually, I got favorable positioning and a lucky streak, so I won. It felt hollow.

On my way back, I came across one of Battle Brothers' many random events: a woman screaming for help. The actual text is fairly long, so here's the summation:
Woman: ""Please! Please help me! My father has fallen into the well!""
Choice 1: ""We don't have time for this. What's another dead peasant? Let's be on our way.""
[b]Choice 2: ""Alright, we'll see what we can do.""[/b]
Narrative: ""From the edge of the well, you see a dark mass of flesh floating in the murky water at the bottom of the well. Rupert pulls you aside, away from the wailing of the woman. 'He's dead.' You nod. It appears the man was fixing the well-head when the wooden beam broke. This left him only one direction to go: down, to a watery grave. Your men manage to hoist the body back up and lay the soaked corpse on the ground. You approach the woman, informing her of his passing. She wipes away a tear, saying, 'Thank you. I'll bury him myself; what's another death in this god-forsaken world?'""

And with that, I finally understood exactly what this game was: a roguelike strategy game with an emphasis on death, misery, and everything in between. You're not supposed to succeed; you're supposed to fail as slowly as possible.

[b]* * * * * GAMEPLAY * * * * *[/b]
The game is divided into two equal parts. The world map is a bleak yet varied collection of cities, roads to connect them, and various NPC groups traveling around. Each ""Map Seed"" provides a randomized world, so no two games turn out the same (apart from the misery and death). Your main motivation for traveling around comes from visiting towns and accepting contracts offered by the ""powers at be"" in return for money. These contracts range in difficulty, but usually involve going somewhere and beating someone up.

Once you've procured money, towns and villages also offer services: a Marketplace for general goods & supplies, specialized industries (Weaponsmiths, Armorers, & more) which allow you to exchange hard-earned money for reliable arms, and a few other helpful buildings. 

Additionally, every town contains a crowd of desperate, hopeful souls seeking payment as a part of your Mercenary Company, as well as sweet release from this mortal coil which has brought them so much misery. (I'm not joking - everyone who's not insane is either fleeing execution or supporting their dying family.) These hirelings begin at a low level, with varying backgrounds (which usually, but not always indicate what they're good at), randomized stats, and negative or positive traits. You don't know what a person is actually good at until you hire them: you could get a dud Swordmaster, or an absolutely amazing Fisherman. There are ways around this, but the idea is that you hire them on faith and hope the good ones last and the bad ones are killed before they sap too much food & money.

Once you've got your weapons, armor, and meatbags, you can hunt down some chaps slightly worse off than you; this brings us to the Battle Map.

Battles take place on a Hexagonal grid, with your chicken-nugget-like mercenaries on one side and the enemy on the other. There are three tiers of ""High Ground"" which provide bonuses, particularly for archers. Terrain, such as snow, bushes, and trees, provide obstacles and cover. I can't describe it in detail, but essentially, each weapon (melee and ranged) has special abilities, strengths, and weaknesses. You're trying to position your troops on advantageous terrain, counter the enemies' weapons, and make sound tactical choices about when to defend, advance, attack, and how ""bold"" you're willing to be. The game is built in such a way that you are expected to lose some men, or suffer permanent injuries, regardless of how good you are. Luck is a huge factor but can be mitigated by playing well.

The enemy AI is pretty devious, depending on difficulty. The Undead charge straight at you with no care; Werewolves try to overwhelm you; Humans are opportunistic; and Goblins & Orcs try to surround & pound. If you survive, you get your opponent's loot and the promise of more death to come.

[b]* * * * * SUMMARY * * * * *[/b]

The devs have clearly put a lot of love into this game. It's got a unique (albeit very deeply depressing) atmosphere, solid mechanics, and a great deal of replayability for those into roguelike Strategy. There's a lot to do and the game itself doesn't get boring due to the progression, randomness, and high difficulty.

I very much enjoyed the game when I figured out what I was doing (thanks to [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=902880552]this excellent guide[/url]), but until that point I felt like I was banging my head against the wall and hoping I would eventually win or receive some clarification amidst the rapidly rising body count. Ultimately, I lost interest due to the insanely bleak atmosphere and the emphasis on raw luck to succeed well. Those who enjoy the challenge or find grim darkness appealing will relish the layers of horror, depression, and misery skillfully woven into the most hopeless pseudo-fantasy universe ever.

WHAT I LIKED THE MOST: Great facial hair; the unforgiving but rewarding learning curve; and laughing at each new, darker turn the game took.

WHO WOULD ENJOY THIS GAME: Fans of XCOM who want a more depressing, random, melee-focused strategy game.

Well, if you're a fan of SRPG's, and hunting for one with roguelike elements, this may be right up your alley. It can be brutally difficult and unfair, even, at times. It's hard to get used to, but you'll have more fun if you lean into your losses instead of rage-quitting or reloading to have a perfect battle.

[b]The Good:[/b]
- Satisfying tactical combat
- A variety of enemies that (generally) require different approaches
- High amount of character builds
- Interesting world

[b]The Bad:[/b]
- Relatively small, content wise (though the roguelike aspects keep things pretty fresh)
- The look of pawns can feel simplistic
- Combat can feel incredibly RNG dependent at times (both with starting terrain and actual combat rolls)
- Some character perks quite visibly inferior

theres no flashy cut scenes, and the layout is more like a chess board but there is somthing very satisfying about planning a success flank and watching as one of your 2 handed axemen gets passed the spear wall and decapitates an archer with his ""split man"" attack, or getting a lucky archers shot and watching the arrow fly into its target.

The map is randomly generated each time you play, all the charcters are randomised as well.

its time consuming and progress is slow, sometimes the dice rolls just making you want to quit and i dont know if its worth the price tag but still a good game for if your looking for a change, and ill probably keep playing it when im looking for somthing more strategic

Ik i only played less than an hour, but i watched 2 hour video of gameplay and read a ton of positive and negative reviews before my purchase.

The party recruiting is there. I could tell this game got deeper than i was willing to put in the effort for. However, I LOVE turn based strategy/combat games. But this one didnt do it for me. I only fought one battle to know it wasnt for me. The attack animation is non existent. The skill selection on what skills to use is like tiny and the writing is way too small. Like i have great eyesight and i was like why are the skill choices THAT small. bad layout.

Worst of anything and right to the main point... Is the randomness of the success of hit chance. Each attack has a % chance to hit. Fine sure, but why is it like constantly 30% or lower and pretty much maxing out at 65%? Even when i got a character behind an enemy, the success chance of hit was 65% at melee. Like jesus....

Fast forard to the last battle (orcish invastion) he stands toe to toe with the orc warlord hacking apart his sheild well the rest of his brothers mop up the lackys.

37,41090459,english,"I really love turn based combat/ RPG style of games and BB is all of this but it falls short of being a great game.

Pros:-

Its easy to get to grips with anyone thats played this style of game before will instantly recognize the gamme play and anyone new will pick it up real fast its nice and simple.

For a top down 2D view it really looks good the map is pleasing to look at and the different towns are well done indeeed.

The UI is again relly well done easy to use and easy to understand.

The randome event Pop-ups are really well writen and some quite funny to read makes for a well earned break.

I could go on but would be easier to say they are alot of pros to this game but the one element that destroys all these pro's is the one Con .... game play.

It is very repetitive and you are constantly fighting a uphill battle you never at any point feel settled or like you have made it. All the milestones are set by the player and even though you reach them the sense of achievement is destroyed by the next wave of enemy's. From what i can tell enemy Warbands do not scale to the player character's skill or gear but rather to your renown the higher it is the harder it get's. Which would be fine but  renown can be gatherd fast and 1050 within 40 in game days this unlocks realm based missions and seems to trigger the first late game event.

12 is the magic number 12 men to your band of mercs and by day 40-50 your just starting to feel settled Bandits and thugs no longer a problem. Your struting around in your plundered Mail shirts and Kite shields so the game steps it up and you pick up a 2 star mission some lord wants you to stop a bunch of Orc Marauders .. ok you say 1350 crowns this i can do you set off on your mission unawear of the danger you face. You reach your destination and see the Marauders its a medium size band 8-9 Orcs made up aof a Few Orc Warriors and many Orc young ones you feel good right? you got this.

Only .... No-WTF How is that balanced, what the hell how is it i am always stunned .... fights over 3 guys limpped away rest are orc food, ok reload ... same results but 10th times the charm .... oooo go **** yourself. reload before you took the mission and go explore. you bump into 6 goblin wolf raiders HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! ... good luck, you will need it.

This game is a fustrating Delight.

Dispite all this i would still recommend it but its not for the light harted relaxed sort of play style but it is fun",1522173060,1522173167,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198084521590,185,5,10201,0,5552,1587734162,,
38,41072593,english,"I wanted to like Battle Brothers.  It has a lot of the things I like in a game.  I like paper doll outfitting characters and turn based combat.  I like big parties.  I like buying, selling, trading and upgrading gear.  So why don't I like this game?

In my opinion after not too many hours of playing, it is simply tedious, and it starts with poor writing.  There is no story.  Well, here is the story.  You are part of a small pack of mercenaries.  The boss dies, and now you are the boss.  Go play.  Other than money, what is the motivation?  Okay, money is a good one, but seriously why?  There are no long quests, a single intermediate goal, and lots of going to towns and recovering <insert name of precious object here>.  That means going out in the world and getting a fixed battle and gaining some gold.

So the battles are, I think, supposed to be the key feature of the game, but it is quickly tedious.  First, the damn archers have the worst aim ever.  It is honestly better to target something other than what you really want to hit, because more often the arrows kill the guy next to the target or worse, your own guys.  It is slow, ponderous, and while it can be challenging it just isn't much fun.

The payoff is the loot.  Oh, wait.  The drops are the absolute worst.  For 500 gold you wander for a day to the spot, spending 150 gold in salary and eating 150 gold in food,  But the payoff could be the loot, right?  Nope.  You get whatever the guys had on IF it isn't damaged (very much).  Since almost all of your attacks (save a few) crush armor on the way, chances are the armor is destroyed.  But you get weapons!  Broken down tier one crap.  And the loot has no real distinguishing features.  The crossbow does 40-60 damage and your new crossbow does 45-65!  That keeps me up at night dreaming of that upgrade.  It doesn't have to be diablo crazy, but a few affixes (20% more damage to undead, +10 hit points, etc), would go a long way towards customizing loot.

I'm not asking for godly, monty hall drops, but damn.  How hard would it be to have a freaking treasure chest in the bad guy camp you could open for some unbroken armor, a gem, a few gold, whatever without having to have your archers change to daggers and try to pin-prick him to death so his armor isn't destroyed.  Unless that's your thing.

And the characters are dull.  They have interesting back-stories when you draft them.  Not being sarcastic.  But how does that translate to their character?

Example, Frodo is a miner who lost his son in the mines.  Now distraught he has joined your band.  Miners are strong and have a good work ethic. (I am paraphrasing).  Now, look at his character after you draft him.  He is +2 to archery and +1 to ranged defense.  Wha?  That guy should be + to hit points, + melee attack.  Another guy was sold to me as a tank, but he was 'tiny' which really made him good for, well, something.  Fodder I guess.

Quests are boring.  Loot unrewarding.  Characters uninteresting.  Battles tedious.

On the plus side, it isn't very expensive.  The battles can be challenging, if unrewarding in terms of loot.  You get some fun encounters on the side of the road that can lead to people joining your party, or people leaving.  If you have the right mix of monks, miners, and gravediggers in your group you may have additional dialog options on the rare occasions you have a random encounter.

Trade is interesting and, while not intuitive, it is at least logical.  Places that have ore will sell it to you cheap, and places that have smelters will buy it for a bit more, depending on your standing.  Your standing, by the way, is invisible.  You will either be neutral or friendly (or whatever) but there is no counter.  No way of knowing whether or not an escort mission for 2 days across the entire map will put you over the top or not.

But, you know, I played it for 4 or 5 days.  I got a good taste of it.  Again, it wasn't expensive.  And I support indie projects (but obviously not so much that I will shade my review), and for the price I don't think it was a total waste of my time, but I just can't recommend it to others.

-This game is extremly repetative, the missions have different storys but what they all really say is ""Go to battle"" or ""Travel to some city and most likley have a battle or two on the way."" All fights are very similar in tactics. Face undead? Dont use spears, otherwise do what you always do. 
-Fear system dosent work that well, I had some fights where my 12 guys will arrive at the 3 enemy archers and kill them the next turn, but instead of fleeing, they shoot at my one guy that got hurt in order to try to kill him. 
-I had a mission where i was supposed to guard a caravan and the caravan got attacked by vampire-like enemies during the night, and for some reason i got to start the fight apart from the caravan i am supposed to protect, and they got killed by the vampires, and i could not know where to go to protect them. Also those Vampires were quite unbalanced, they could teleport each turn longer then my guys can walk AND attack after teleporting...
-The game need a strategic element on the world map or something else going on gameplay wise. Now it is only Manage your team, Take missions - go fight, repeat. On the side there is a very simplistic trade system, that allow you to gain a little extra money.
-Battle is only okay, not that fun, and not nearly fun enought to carry the game.
-Adding more experienced soldiers to your team is waaaay to expensive, not so much the initial cost to buy them, but thier upkeep is insane... So the game encurage you to grind up new level 1 characters if someone falls in battle. So yeah, grinding...

The Good:
+The characters have some fun little traits that give some personality to your team, and their kill score and time in the company is recorded. If this was expanded opon, it could have been great, now it is okay if you care about it. They can also have permanent injuries that add some spice to the character. 
+There are some events from time to time that add a little spice to the game, it dosen't happen to often tho, and dosen't matter that much it seems this far. I had a cultist that converted another soldier into a cultist wich I found intresting, but noting happened with that potential storyline.

I understand that most of the variables controlling combat is available (there is also the RNG) but that info is spread around in various areas and doesn't seem to be presented in a single interface didctating combat (hover over char to get character stats, hover over attack to find attack metrics, hover over tiles to get terrain info).  All this could be calculated and displayed in a better interface in my personal opinion.

Then there's the RNG issue.  I prefer strategy games that give the user all info that decide outcome before taking the action (see Into the Breach).  Random can be fun but I do not like how it is implemented in this game.

59,25701403,english,"This game is good, it's like a cross between Mount and Blade and a turn-based medieval combat sim.  Your team is represented by the upper torso of each character on a base, like a miniature.  Movement is hex based.  The maps, and hexes, need some work, as the angle is odd and feels wrong.  It's also hard to see what each enemy has for gear if they're behind a tree, rock, hill or other character because of the angle.  I haven't found a way to rotate the maps.

The story - basically after a fight you and your mercenary company barely win you're left with only a few troops.  You can hire more, and you'll need to.  You choose their armour, weapons and other gear then lead them into a battle against the bandit whose horde destroyed most of your troops.  And, hopefully, you'll win!  The bandit also recrutied a few more troops, so it's not likely to be an easy fight.  Once you get past this point, you choose what you do.  There's no set storyline.

This game can be played as a roguelike with permadeath in ironman mode where you can't save-scum, but you can play normally as well.  I am right now, as I'm still learning how the game works.  Once I do, I'll probably run an Ironman campaign to see how well I do with that.  Your troops will take serious injuries, like a collapsed lung, that gives permanent negative traits.  In this case, lower maximum fatigue.

They'll also gain levels, get better at fighting and learn talents.  You can make a fast swinging dagger user who gets bonus % to hit every time he misses until he hits, then the bonus re-sets.  You can build an armour smashing skirmisher with a huge hammer and heavy armour.  You can have skirmish units with two handed axes to smash shields, and javelins to weaken the enemy from a distance.  Your missile weapon units can carry a backup polearm, and attack from the back ranks.  I can write for probably an hour about all the combat options, better to leave you to discover the bulk of them on your own.

You also have to manage supplies like food, ammunition, medical supplies, morale, payroll, equipment, etc.  It's actually pretty fun once you get the hang of it, but there's no manual and the game doesn't really hold your hand - which is fine.  You can learn most of the ins and outs by playing.

This one gets a big thumb's up from me, it's pretty fun.  It needs work, but as of writing this review it's still in early access so that's not a big deal.  It's worth the price of admission as is, and it's only going to get better.

Edit:  I have some issues with the final product.  Armour evaporates when battles are complete.  Anyone wearing damaged armour who dies, even your own troops, magically loses that armour almost all the time.  I also don't like how armour works in the game.  It becomes useless while worn in combat after just a few hits.  That's *NOT* how armour works.  Also there's no damage type vs armour mechanics.  A hammer absolutely demolishes all armour, including quilted or padded and maille both of which would take little to no damage from a hammer blow and certainly would not be destroyed by just a few hits.  You can hit a t-shirt with a hammer for an hour and still have a t-shirt left over at the end so why would a qulited gambeson be destroyed with one or two swings?  Armour needs to provide protection, albeit reduced, when it's damaged.  Not give a HP buffer.  It needs to reduce damage from most hits, and deflect anything that strikes at the wrong angle if the armour is strong enough (depends on type, of course).  The issues with armour are the biggest problems this game still has, and sadly I doubt that it will ever be addressed.

The economy is very unbalanced and it's unlikely they'll ever fix it.  The game balance is off, it's a bit too hard early on.  Sometimes it's hard to find appropriate missions and the 1 to 3 skull rating to estimate difficulty of each mission is not very accurate at all.  Price to repair items is often far more than the worth of the same item, again going back to issues with the economy.

Save and load times are longer than they need to be for a game that's this simple.

Enemies have access to abilities and character types you can't get.  Ever.  Like magic users.  You never get those.  Some enemies are cheap.  Yes, I'm talking mostly about goblins, but there are a few others that feel like they've got cheap moves or abilities that you can't get that are unbalanced, unfiar, or overpowered.

This could be an amazing game, right now I say it's about a 7/10.  Hope they patch it a bit more and fix some of the balance issues but mostly the two biggest issues - how armour works (or doesn't work more like it) and vanishing equipment after battles.",1474842237,1521713668,True,2,0,0.500548839569091797,0,True,False,True,76561197965396869,1507,146,3783,0,3472,1544342921,,

This is just a 2D knock-off of Mount & Blade with less quests/options, no mods and a more repetative story. They didn't even bother to add in animations. You play as a free-floading chess piece in space. The RNG sometimes creates non-sensical world builds with comically inefficient roads. After playing a couple campaigns, the game is just a grind to accomplish and gain nothing interesting -- just more grind.

It is unfortunate that in order to realize how terrible the game really is, you need to spend over 2 hours which is past steam auto-refund time. I was really hoping the game would add more depth at some point, but saddly it is quite underwhelming. Why is this $15? And the asking price is $30? This is a cheap indie game, why they charge so much is anyone's guess.

So - what is Battle Brothers? I think a closest description would be a mix of RPG with a tabletop miniature wargaming games. You can't avoid this comparison thanks to the game art-style based on hexagonal (battle) maps with stylized figures representing various characters on the map. Another game that BB reminds me of is - obviously - Mount & Blade.

I honestly would wish they continued to expand on this formula (and the setting) and add more layers of meta progression a more alive (and bigger) map with more things to happen and factions to act more independetly and ""natural"", whereas the player only plays a minor role in all the events but is able to become more important and influential.
Thats basically all there, just only the starting point.
Which saddens me then to hear/read/see that they go into a different direction with a new game. As far as i remember the new game will have similar premise but is set in a futuristic universe.

- Turn based combat (hard and unforgiving, still winnable but you will lose people), 
- a quite big map with an interesting world and a lot of possibilities
- not only mercenary contracts of various kinds but also trading with moving goods from a to b
- a story line of sorts
- customization of your mercenary group that can develop in various directions
- nice boardgame art style that still offers brutal visuals, like decapitations which are even needed for certain enemies.
- enough replayability through randomized maps, contracts etc.
- different characters to hire with  a lot of skills and traits that offer fun events throughout your journey
- many different weapons and armorpieces which have different effects in every aspect of combat, like nets used to disable enemies.
- the game feels coherent although its randomly generated in pretty much every way, it never feels as if the game was built out of setpieces.

Sure, strategy plays a role, and good strategy can take you far, but in the end, RNG is the deciding factor.

Great game overall. Can be pretty brutal at the beginning, but it's not ""game over"" brutal. There's always the retreat button.
The player needs to learn quickly when to fight and when to run away. In the early game, the band is little more than a bunch of peasants, so one can't expect to fight everything that moves.

As the game goes on, some fights become easy, but the company never becomes completely unbeatable. The chance to lose a valuable brother in a big fight is always there. I consider this a very positive aspect, because steamrolling everything would become very boring very quickly.

Graphics: simple but in a good way. There's some real quality in those sprites.
Soundtrack: excellent.

93,40759108,english,"Fell in love with the game since the beginning, you pretty much control a band of mercenaries and go around a randomly created map while completing quests or 'contracts'.
 
The gameplay entails using the world map and a combat map, the former being used to move your group throughout settlements and the surrounding wilderness with all its own secret and hidden badguy camps with treasure and loot, and during combat you're taken to a small hex map with your mercenaries pitted against the opponents.
 
The story's decent in my opinion, and there's a certain goal system to keep you striving toward a certain criteria you need to meet that increases your popularity or reputation. 

I enjoy the replayability it has to offer, no two mercenaries/recruits are the same (except the 'companions' which can be reobtained using the same game seed number thing) due to the different stats and traits they come with when hired which are all random with few exceptions to avoid redunancies and problems. The talent (stars) also makes them unique because it allows them to have better number rolls to pump up the certain stat and are applied at random.

There's a variety of opponents to fight against with different tactics to keep you on your feet and learn to win against them. 

The gameplay and combat in general can be unforgiving, this isn't Pokemon where your party members just faint and you can bring them back to the hospital to revive. They either die permanently or survive with a permanent injury that can make them pretty useless or just partially lower some base stats. Though the game offers options to avoid this by returning to a previous save state unless you're playing with *Ironman Mode* that removes that option to go back in time and not lose that member. Its really up to you if you want to play with the training wheels on or go in without any safety net preventing you from losing that really great member or from a good part of your party to the full squad from a bad battle or call (I just lost my entire group to a group of 12 direwolves just tearing through my flanks thinking I could take them). 

The game's fun in my opinion, it goes something like: getting a decent start, a few guys with greats stats/traits/talents getting wiped out or being left with 3/12 mercenaries, learning from your mistakes, then repeating. It's very addictive, it's got this mentality that tells you to just do that one last contract or go to that one last settlement to buy supplies or trading goods that makes it really time consuming. 

One last thing I'll add is the somewhat difficult learning curve that might repel future players, there isn't exactly a full tutorial in the game, it has a few training scenarios but it sort of throws you in there and lets you learn by yourself and call the shots. This doesn't make it unplayable or impossible to play as you can either watch user uploaded videos on Youtube or check the very helpful wiki, forum, etc. I myself enjoy learning as I play and not being spoonfed everything or being reminded every second of what to do and how to do it.

4,40570436,english,"I really enjoyed Battle Brothers.

The mechanics of the game can be summarized as a turn-based mount and blade, in that you form a group of mercenaries and travel around the countryside doing jobs, including escorting caravens and fighting orcs/undead/bandits.   Managing your food, weapons, and payroll while traveling around the world to fufill your contracts is the overworld game you play between battles.  The battles themselves are turn based and tactical, with each characters weapon defining their abilities.  

The art is fantastic, especially with regard to how it shows the damage your characters take in fight.  The setting is dark and medieval, but with some sparse fantasy thrown in.  You wont recruit any mages, but you will fight plenty of zombies.  

Your mercenary company is smaller and more intimate than in M&B, and you get to know your men well.  Their deaths, or even grevious injuries, are major events that will leave you grieving.  

Also, the game is brutally hard.  I would recomend this game to anyone who enjoys punishing tactical games like XCOM or Darkest Dungeon.  I have come no where close to beating it, but even the failures make for an enjoyable experience.

This game is pretty cool. Fans of games like XCOM or even Civilization will have much fun with this game. I tried it multiple times and this time I really wanted to play through the game but it sadly couldn't catch my attention for another 25 hours or so.
The reason is probably because I just didn't see a purpose in playing becase there was no give goal to aim for. I am at that point in the game where I have all 12 mercenaries very good equiped and I can pretty much win every fight without losing a companion. So because there is no real goal, I spent the last 5 hours just going from quest to quest and gaining money. Which sadly became boring and I don't want to spend another 5 hours with that.

On the other hand you feel so powerful when you wipe out an overwhelming enemy army with no losses expet a few armor scratchens.

SO why am i not recommending this game atm?

I would love to give this game a BIG !YES! but i feel too offended by the percentage of your hit chance in this game.
The combat in Battle Brothers is all about countering and hit chance and as i got used to this game i used some time to look at the hit chance, bc every time you try to strike an enemy there is a percentage written over his head telling you the chance to strike.
The problem is that i dont really think this number is telling the truth because it happens 50% of the time that you miss 5 60% in a row and the enemy mows through your shieldwalls with 8/10 hit at an estimated hit chance of 20% 

AND since your merceneries are so damn important it is a mess if you have to load over and over again just because of this suspicious hit chances..

I am going to correct this review when some more patches went over this game but allthough this game ist the BEST mercenary simulator, the player feels quite mocked around by this one deficit...


EDIT: (10.02.2018)  The Hit Chances still are just ridiculous, and you get too less money early game and too much money late game!!

34,22577994,english,"My final review (I had posted an early access one previously):
An outstanding turned based tactics game as well as a mercenary company management game. 

-While it's graphics are simple the game makes excellent use of a ""painted"" style that really works for it. 

-While the music is ""samey"" over extended play time, for it is it's good.

-You're little mercenaries devlop personality and carry scars from battle to battle, making their inevitable and unfortunate death that much more meaningful.  

Somethings to be aware of: 

-This game is pretty hard and unintentionally unforgiving. 

-If RNG based combat drives you up a wall, this game may not be for you. 

-At times the mechanics happening in battle are poorly explained or expressed by the game and can feel frustrating.

-The AI isn't terrible, but it isn't great either. 

-This is a ""low fantasy"" type setting. Not much magic, gritty and you're dudes will seldom have the advantage.

and buy legit stuff. Still I wish I had more of following

COMBAT:
- would be nice heaving 100 more ENEMY units (for example ballistas, rabid dogs, bears, pigs, warpigs, werewolfs and lycantropy mechanics overall, witches to actually be burned, more undead, merfolk, flying units) more WEAPONRY choices (katanas, sabres, spadas, rapiers,harquebuse, torches and fire mechanics; cavalry mechanisms, including ELEPHANTS); more complex field modifiers; some low magic supports (if not units on combat field, as commander abilities -spellcasts or tricks- on battlefield); spellbooks (three spells per book is fine); amazons, valkyres, vampiresses, battle maidens, succubs - for hire (game kinda lacks females); more talents; sea battles; sea mechanics; 

EXPLORATION:
- while u go to certain location, something happens and then u fight - that way seems very very simplistic. I suggest minimaps with party separation events, locations inside accesible via special professions and tools, good events and bad events without actual fight, actual fights, and pure non-stop combat in orkish camps. There are fortifications at map, would be nice to use some of walls, or at least seeing them on fighting field. Ofc, requires more drawing.

POLITICS:
- more fractions with more political involvement and harder impact from choices (permanent impact); more states, the Holy See, Free City, selfmade colonies, cities in the sky etc.); adding actual KINGS to the states; piracy options; brigand options; Complex multi stage quests

MISC:
- ingame cardgame in taverns; larger map; Europe map seed; Global events - Sun eclipse, Strong norhtern winds, Earthquakes, Volcanos - having impact on game in certain locations or time; unaccesable territories without specific maps or guides bought.",1517079767,1517079767,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198069373199,48,7,12002,0,1751,1595460472,,

BB is still a very good game, and I would recommend it, however, I can't help but miss Darklands when I am playing it. It's almost like missing your first love, when you are out on a date with your new girlfriend. 

Still it's a solid platform, and if the developers would give Darklands a go, I am sure the experience would give them plenty of ideas on how to expand Battle Brothers.

Here's a simple recommendation on what I think would immediately improve BB.. provide the option to have bigger maps with more towns / cities. Allow the player to choose a big sprawling world to explore, instead of the 15 odd towns / cities which gets really boring after the 10th visit. Better still, provide more things to do in each town. Give them more character. Try out Darklands and you will know what I meant.

Game is NOT a turn based tactical (FIre Emblem, Warsong, Shining Force, XCOM, etc.) it is a rogue like with horrible difficulty spikes and unforgiving RNG; I thought I was buying one and got the other.

If you are into that sort of thing press on, I on the other hand do not enjoy this style of game AT ALL and have seen a lot of new games go this direction to my dismay so I have to voice my displeasure. 

You enjoy dying over and over again even on the easiest difficulty? You enjoy game overs? You enjoy situations where there isn't a chance in hell of winning a fight and your only option is to flee and fail the quest or die? I personally don't.

If you want a game like I suggested avoid this like the plague as it will suck you into the 2+ hours ""point of no return"" for refunds before opening you up to ""the real game"" and then you are f***ed.

Easiest difficulty vs Bounty Hunters
- I attack 60% chance miss
-I miss
-I miss
-I miss
-I miss
-Enemy archer attacks my archer 6 spaces away standing behind two dudes with shield- INSTA ♥♥♥♥ING KILL

Reload and try again... 10th time in this fight same results every ♥♥♥♥ing time, easiest ♥♥♥♥ing difficulty.

Don't even get me started on the undead, the games balance is s*** Period. 

Beaten XCOM(s) on Ironman Vet, DOS on Honor Mode, every Fire Emblem on vet (infamously hard), Dragon Age Origins on Vet, Dark Souls, etc etc.

This game will never be larger than the fifty people currently sitting in their moms basement crunching 1000+ hours into the game just so they can tell their moms they are ""good at something in life"" and frustrated people in the forums ""git gud son!"". 

A game that has battles that are impossible to win and forced on the player (scripted events) unless you are willing to let as many as half of your people die in a single battle so that you are forced to go around and recruit more people and grind them back up to a decent level only to watch as half die in another forced scripted battle is a time sink, not fun, and will never have a large audience- it is niche. 

Rogue likes need to get the ♥♥♥♥ out of strategy games or at the very least stop masquerading as such- it is like someone offering to play chess with you and half way through the game randomly jumping up and down on the board, looking up at you and saying ""yeah, you lose they all died... git gud son"". This is NOT a tactical game, this is NOT a strategy game, this is a rogue like turn based with a squad. Period.

58,39444597,english,"Well, I really like this game. 
It got me into the same grip that Mount & Blade did. And before you ask, no they're not quite the same.  
Yeah, yeah, it's the same concept, start as sh***y looking ugly dudes, killing people and looting corpses, managing daily wages, equipment, resources and morale. However they differ in a few crucial things. 

First. Battle Dudes is able to express more individuality from each little fellow in your group. They have names and stuff, you know. Each backgorunds makes them interact in their own sort of way with the world, and the way you build them makes each one of them a special bloodthirsty murderous snowflake. 

Second. You can't rule s**t. You get contracts and make profit and that's it, you walk around, enter towns, see if they have anything for you, if they do, you do, if not you buy some food and hit the road.   

Third. Weapons are more complex. This game focus on strategy over action. Each weapon has it's own purpose, and you should give it some thought before heading into battle. As my old man says, don't bring a fork on a soup day, you know? Like, don't try to stab skeletons with spears, or hit massive armoured orc warlord with a lame a** sword. Don't want to take my word for it? try it. 

Fourth. Losses have more impact, but you get a fair shot from learning from your mistakes. You'll spend hours building your little bros, you'll eventually put terror to any house army with 24 dudes with arbalests and pikes and shields and knights, BUT you might get a little too cocky, and while exploring the land looking for a worthy opponent you may come across a goblin camp and think to yourself ""I'm gonna sod***** these ugly f*** faces with their sh***y bows"" and so you inadvertedly walk in, shouting and screaming things about their mommas green a**es , even putting a low level squire you hired, just to find 46 goblins lock and loaded. There are like  ambushing goblins, wolfriding goblins, voodoo goblin, lawyer goblin, coffee lady goblin, regular goblins, a whole society of goblins. Essentially you walked in goblins' Tijuana  saying those nasty things. So they do go hard on you, kill your recent employed squire, which is kinda ok, because he started growing into you, and even it's hard to face it you will eventually keep on going, but the harsh pill is that old farm dude you had with you almost since day 1. The humble dude who saved your other dude from an orc warrior and who managed to kill the first necroservant right after he killed you best archer because you thought he was safe in the back of your frontline and did now know those dudes had the ability to teleport and properly give you a suprise bu**fu**. That dude will be missed, and you may take a while until you develop another little comrade to fill his role. 

Nevertheless, losses are hard but valuable lessons, and this game reminds you of that in a nice but bloody manner.   

Final thoughts:
The game is a bit expensive, but absolutely no regrets from buying it. 
Nice balance between challenge x reward. 
Very replayable. Good soundtrack. Nice in game mechanics.

_____________________________
The game itself is fun, there's not a lot to do other then kill (which I approve of) and its worth buying for under 10 bucks. However, this down rating is because the devs released 1 patch and then announced their done..................

I personally am glad I bought the game, but I bought it before they announced they weren't patching anymore. If I had known that I would not have bought the game. 

Pros:
Death is fun
Random stories that appear are awesome
Have lots of different background characters
Combat is fun
Decent amount of items and loot
3 different wars are a blast

Cons:
Random map generation during combat needs to be fixed, it can totally hose you as the enemy can spawn basically on 4 tiles up and you below them and they will shred you with ranged. 
Once you figure out what to do, the game is actually easy and you are just prey to the RNG.

64,39388012,english,"This is one of those games that follows in the ironman genre, where players enjoy the frustrating experience of true struggle and loss. I like a lot of games in this genre, FTL, Crusader Kings 2, X-COM 2 all come to mind. Although there is a great deal of strategy to enjoy in this game, ultimately I feel it fails as a true ironman experience. The reason being that, ironman games must be balanced by their longevity, and they are extremely sensitive to the flaws of their designs. Take Crusader Kings 2 for example, even after losing many/most of your feudal titles if your patient you can still rise again. FTL is a rather short-game experience for ironman and so, when I play a total loss experience in that game I'm not quite so frustrated. But battle brothers fails to balance its longevity, you'll eventually reach a point where you'll either lose most of your company or they'll all be so wounded you literally can't afford to heal them. Even if u do manage to pull of a miracle and pull some back together, if it's later in the game then any raw recruits you have will only be extra mouths to feed. There's a few other big time errors I don't like as well, they have a world map system where you engage nearby groups of people by simply moving in to them. However sometimes they will group up, and you'll end up engaged with 30+ units, and they won't even give u the option to fall back (seriously were they high?)? Also, the larger your party the slower you move so, why then are these larger groups of bandits always catching me as I'm trying to flee?

All in all, this game is one of those love stories. Good memories, but you couldn't ignore it's flaws so you had to move on. Hopefully things changed and got better for them.

So many reviews claim this isn't worth the cost, and the game is not finished, and they could not be more incorrect.  Perhaps the characters being half bodies make them think it is not complete?  

Many others claim balance issues, and to be candid, I would simple suggest that they are bad at turn-based strategy games.  In my opinion, this game is much less punishing than most recent strategy games I have played.  While there is a steep learning curve you quickly learn the ropes.  My first couple playthroughs I lost entire companies in a single fight  (orcs are brutal, yet balanced), but I kept going.  I did not just complain the game was hard.  I figured it was my misunderstanding of perks, etc. and I was correct.  Trying new builds made things that much easier.

Anyways, I do not want to come off as condescending; there is just a lot of ""I'm angry I couldn't faceroll this game"" rants in the reviews.

Pros: 
- Incredible fighting & strategy core structure.
- Great dialogue development and interactions between character backgrounds; despite no actual storyline.
- Steady difficulty/gear power creep.
- A lot of diversity in character backgrounds, perk builds.

Cons:
- Higher difficulties can (are) quite a grind, rather than actual upscaling (IMO).
  - Two factors: combat & economic.  After having done it, I would never recommend playing expert economic.  The later game becomes an overwhelmingly boring grind of gold to pay your company while out exploring for unique (legendaries) items.

I do like that  you can free roam for a bit until the final part of the story statrs to catch up and you need to focus on that.

Pros,

Gameplay is great.   Good mix of battles vs your company.  Not over or under powered.
Mission selection is spot on.  You are allowed to pick certain missions based on your fame level.  
Equipment - randomly available in the shops and found in battles.  Love the random loot.

Cons.
Graphics could be better.   More 2017 insterad of 1990's

Basically what all the other reviews said is true. RNG is stupid in this one. Like, really stupid. There are times when you will be missing over and over depite an 80%+ chance to hit. It can be infuriating. But, once you learn the mechanics and the different enemies and their weaknesses, you are in for a nice long treat with tons of replayability. 

I got my ironman group up to 170 days but then decided to retire them and play without ironman because I was just alt-F4ing almost every battle anyways due to bullshit RNG. So I'm playing regular mode with quicksave and it's a lot more enjoyable. 

Here's the mindset I recommend you have going into this game: Don't worry about losing a guy or two, they come cheap and are easily replaced unless they're a super high level;  expect bad RNG, going in expecting the worst is your best bet for a healthy playthrough; be patient on learning how it goes, took me probably 10+ hours before I got the hang of it and started winning every battle with ease.

Just two things to consider for potential customers:
- The game is hard to learn, even harder to master and does not have a state-of-the-art tutorial (just a few youtube videos). But if you invest a few hours time to get into it you will be rewarded with an exciting masterpiece of a game.

14,38271774,english,"I have great difficulties rating this game, so I go against the trend and give it a thumbs down. It certainly doesn't deserve overwhelming positivity. Sometimes Battle Brothers is extremely frustrating and sometimes very rewarding. The exploration, management, event and rudementary story aspects are really neat and even the combat can be more than bearable at times. Unfortunately, combat is the game's focus.

My main complaint about it is actually that the battles are too difficult, even on Beginner/Beginner (and the devs say it is meant to be played on Veteran!). Now, one could argue that the challenge is part of the fun (and it certainly is for the hardcore crowd, to which I don't belong and the beginner difficulty kinda defeats the point), but there is more to this. Let me summarize:
- The game does a very bad job at explaining itself, so you have to find out what works on your own. Which, again, could be interesting in itself, if it wasn't so intent on punishing the player for every mistake.
- The types of challenges are very repetitive and turn into tedium after a while. Either you figure it out or you don't. There isn't much variance both in your enemies and your own customization options. This wouldn't be a problem if the game could be finished in 12 hours. It can't.
- Optimization is mandatory, which again limits any variance in experiencing the game. It also infringes on the enjoyment of the minor aspects: exploration and roleplay. Worse, the builds for your mercenaries are all extremely similar and a lot of abilities are completely pointless or very circumstantial. Character progression, of course, is linear. The heavier armour is almost always the correct choice etc.
- There is no coming back. If you screw up a run, you might as well start a new campaign. This relates to the next point:
- Horrible pacing and threat scaling. The difficulty indicators and monetary rewards for each mission are grossly misleading. You never know what will happen until you know the composition of the enemy forces. Battle Brothers also falls into the same trap as D&D with the release of 3.X, namely an inflexible challange rating. You simply won't get easy fights. And engaging something too far above your CR is suicide. This results in an extremely even pacing with few ups and downs. A first time engagement still feels like a climax, but everything in between is just the same.

That said, I enjoy Battle Brothers a lot when its not out there to punish me. Had it mod support it would probably be a phenomenal game by now.",1513136742,1514385281,False,11,1,0.497052609920501709,0,True,False,False,76561198005760542,115,64,7219,0,6251,1536529697,,

After 10h:
Re.tarded beyond understanding, devs got imagination, must admit. You play this game to get fucked, your team gets oneshoted left and right in fights and on map money is a timer (daily maney for mercs) - no way you will waste minute, one bad roam, one bad fight and you start game over again.
Guys dont get me wrong, content is made 5+/10, random events super cool feature , but way too often it doesnt feel fair how you end up (most precious - fully surrounded enemy dodge/block 15 hits in a row - no backstab mechanic -  half of your team gets slaughter that time, then you load or game is over. Often feels like game fucks you on purpose - Darkest Dungeon without ""deaths door"" mechanic).

Ok, after 100h try hard :
In this game, gameplay is save load grind through fights. 
Gameplay is money rush as money is a timer - and quests - source of money - are often money inefficient, also difficulty evaluation of quests is often missleading; both scenarios = you done. Hard to recommend someone a frustration.
Game brings no tools to stay in it, no tools for outplay. All is simple to the limits, simplistic with fights based on random numbers roll/ battle starting position(enemy on highground = you done) instead tools you can use for outplay. 

Game has good concept and framework and beside so much feels so beta version. 
This could be a very good game with better developer, or developer who simply allows moding.
This game is painful save load grind.

After 300h:
This game ""looks"", its all devs needed to sell it. Not much in it. Linear gameplay, little into lategame, RNG(randomly generated numbers) based, poor beta content, lacking features/lacks features; solutions.
On top of that devs seem to abandon this android beta along with being agains moding (encrypted game files) - developer with ""Gardener's Dog"" mentality [spoiler]woof over cucumber[/spoiler] - will forbid to others, but not take himsalfe. Game's community turned out to be rly cool and rly dedicated, developer turned out to be a greedy as*hole - thing I will remember Gardener's Dog Studio by. 30 euro for content worth 7 is a real joke too (and its not about money, its abot content).
This game has 90% positive rating, 95% in last 30 days. You throw stacking positives, sales get driven by it (snowball) instead being driven by game content. Noob dev stays satisfied, players to come (years of newcomers) stay with content empty beta. If I only knew, I would be better off dealing with gardener's dogs, I hardly remember feeling so disappointed. Because, honestly, would you sheet out a child just to sell it? Or seeing its potential made it beautiful? You would write positive review to sell it even better, right?

There is one thing I want to share, turned out Gardener's Dog Studio left sprites files not encrypted so moders had a look. Its comparison what this game could possibly be and it express more then all that review.

Also one more comparison (sprite colour saturation mod used as in links above). In this game the higher camera, the heavier shader shows up. This is 55IQ decision that results in making these lovely graphics - straight ugly and experience - obnoxious. Self shot to the knee, and files to fix this are encrypted lol (imagine sb sells you fail product and prevents you from fixing it), just check it out.

24,38515695,english,"Battle Brothers is a really solid title for people interested in replayable sandbox games in a medieval fantasy world with a large dose of danger.  The game is quite difficult and the risk/reward of battle can lead to feelings of total disappointment or the utmost euphoria.

In this game you are the leader of a recently fallen mercenary band and your job is to build it back up.  The main gameplay loop centers around going to townships on a procedurally generated overworld map in search of gear, supplies, recruits, and contracts for a variety of tasks.  Many of the tasks you're hired for will end up putting you in a battle, which takes place on a tactical terrain hex map.  

Battle strategy is a book in it's own right.  Turn based strategy with a strong emphasis on cohesion and falling back to plan B, I consider this the thrill of the game.  You might want to look at some Youtubers for help on this, as there are many variables that go into a battle and you want to be certain to tip the odds in your favor when possible.

In the overworld every 100 or so days a crisis will trigger and the game turns into an epic fantasy with a land in peril from one of three potential threats.  Upon ending the crisis another will spawn in 100 days, and all three crises can be experienced in one long, epic game.

The campaign has an OPTION for ""Ironman Mode"" and the game is NOT ""Rogue-like"" by default.  In a normal game you can save and load as in most titles.  

When I had played a good many rounds of this I began to interest myself with more in-depth strategy and began to seek out what others had been doing via the internet.

26,38509613,english,"This is a well-made game, but be aware it's more roguelike than X-Com. NOTE: I'm reviewing this based off of the veteran combat difficulty.

This is an RNG heavy game from your starting world setup, to your starting companions, to future mercenaries, to encounters, to contracts, etc. etc. Despite this, it is unforgiving and brutal. Mistakes cost you your run. RNG costs you your run. Poor economy skills cost you your run.

**PROS**

*    Artwork is gorgeous.
*    Writing is much better than expected for a generated roguelike.
*    Combat is smooth


**CONS**

*    RNG Heavy - RNG can cost you a run which to me is a turn off. If you're a big fan of roguelikes, this may not be a big issue to you.

*    Poor Handling of Microfailures - To me, part of the fun of X-COM and other permadeath games is that you can have these microfailures where key members die and sometimes the potential of a team wipe. It provides consequence for failure but allows you to continue. In this, one death or wrong positioning has a decent chance to wipe your team or do a force retreat which injures all of your team for several days. Effectively making you useless. Might as well restart than spend 4 days draining yourself of bandages, food, and gold trying to heal up. That makes failure less interesting and more tedious. Again, you may like this if you enjoy a lot of roguelikes.

* Lack of Information - One thing that makes tactical games fun is that you have most of the information you need to understand what choices you're making. It's difficult to tell how dangerous an enemy is and whether you should flee or not. It's difficult to tell how dangerous a given mission is.

**Summary**

If you enjoy roguelikes and tactics/srpgs, pick this up right now. If you like roguelikes or tactics/srpgs and aren't sure on the other, pick this up on sale. If you hate the idea of dudes on a grid, the screenshots really should have been enough to dissuade you.

7/10 for me personally. It was very well made and was enjoyable to try. I might play it again.

Pros:
- Rogue-like with perma-injury and perma-death
- Not easy
- Enemy races have racially motivated tactics (e.g. zombies run in stupidly, goblins will harass you, etc.)
- Weapons have various effects (e.g. axe is great for breaking shields, military pick damages armor, etc.)
- Pawns show injuries and permanent injuries.
- Sandbox game
- The text based events help draw you feel attached to your characters.
- Feels gritty as though you really are the leader of a Merc band (if you read the text)
- Mercs that are recruited are assigned traits, either good, bad, or nothing. They can also acquire them later too.

Cons:
- no mounts or magic (for your company)
- higher difficulties are brutal
- only a few races and monster types. 
- no steam workshop
- can't build your own stronghold

Battle Brothers is a good game. I enjoy playing it and i recommend buying it (< 10$), but not without hesitation. 
The game has many good qualities:
[list]
[*]neat design
[*]intelligent AI
[*]simple but nothing the less demanding
[*]easy to get things started
[*]stays attractive also after hours of playing, because there are many combination possibilities of weapons, skills, tactics
[*]misstakes are punished hard and irredeemable (pushes my ambitions even harder)
[*]the game has much potential of improvements and extentions, that holds the hope up that there will be updates and/or DLCs

BUT...
There is one thing that is really bad implemented, the randomness calculation. And this one thing really makes me sometimes losing the interest in the game totally.
The calculation system does not try to come close the probability percentage, it just rolls the 100 dice over and over again. 
So it can happen that you are doing everything right and still have horrible losses that will most likely end the round, because the game forgives nothing.
I hope the developer(s) will take a look at randomness calculation, like it is used in gambling games.

Growing the size of your company and specializing your men as they level via gear and talents really gets you invested.  Losing a veteran feels awful, but then you just have to recruit and train up a replacement and hope he meets a better end than his predecessor.

You are basically running a mercenary business, doing this for the money and not for the greater good! So don't get too attached to your guys, because the game is challenging and losing brothers is part of the fun. You will lose, you will learn.

The art style is detailed and unique, not to mention varied, for every item and character in the game. Special shoutout for the facial details. The writing is also great.

The gameplay is extremely varied:

- Many types of weapons with their own ability sets, you have so many options to play with and adapt to enemy types
- Party formations and backup slots for recovering injured guys or rotating them
- Mercenary backgrounds offer a lot of variety and random events associated to them
- An economic system that fluctuates according to demand, events and relationship, providing trading opportunities or scarcity
- Contracts allow you to help a town, make money and befriend them to get better prices
- Weapons and armor variety in shops and as loot include different tiers, up to unique types
- Replayability is insane, every map is generated according to seeds so no playthrough is the same (unless you want it)
- 3 end game crises makes you feel part of a world that is suffering and changing around you, forcing you to adapt to new challenges, encounters and raids
- Skill tree for leveling up your mercenaries helps you to specialize their roles in your band

83,37737878,english,"After so many hours into the game I can finally say what I like and dislike about the game.

Fisrt and foremost, the gameplay is simply awesome. You are put in a shoes of mercenary company capitan, and you have to manage your company to become the greatest and most formidable force in the world. Simple, isn't it? Well, it isn't. To achieve this dream, you have to kill a lot of things first. And kiling them isn't easy at all. You always need to be careful, because one wrong step can cause you the lives of one of your men. 

Death is part of the game. Defeat is part of this game. Starting over is part of this game. Landing on your knees over and over again is part of this game. Those things ARE this game and it's not bad, because the most satisfying part of this game is the feeling of accomplishment, when you finally can stand firmly on your feet. When the brigands start to run away from your company with fear, the noble houses try not to anger you and even orcs and goblins start to retreat in fear from you in battle. 

THIS is what this game is about. Loss, defeat, anger and learning. Difficult and challenging but satisfying as hell.

The artstyle is on point. It suits well the dark, medieval, fantastic, brutal tone of the game. Needles to say, I'm a fan of hand-drawn graphics.

Although, like the coin has two sides, so has this game. Not everything is perfect. RNG can sometimes screw you over, you can grind your teeth in anger, when you try for few hours to get a certain item, encounter or character background (freaking occultists man...) and still not get them. The fact, that your bros can start at highly disadvantageous ground, being stuck in a dumb place, being shot right into the face at the first turn before you can act is... Annoying to say the least. 
Also, no mod support is really, really, REALLY bad for a game like this. There is oh so much content, that can be put into the game, but there is no mod support to do that. I can even say, that there are more modding possibilities than in Mount and Blade. New races, backgrounds, adding spells into the game, new battlefields, new enemies, sea combat, more weapons, more encounters, more world interactions, story even. There is so much that can be added into the game, that I can't even write it all. Although, no mod support won't allow to add this things into the game. Unfortunately.

So, would I recommend this game? Yes. Wholeheartedly. Can I say that it's worth it's price? I'm not sure. Would I like to add something to it? Hell yeah! Am I sad or angry about the RNG system? Yup, hella angry about the FREAKING CULTISTS NEVER APPEARING FOR ME...

You train, equip and manage your soldiers as you guide them through the hostile and uncaring world of a mercenary in which the classic good vs evil mentality is meaningless - you're there to do a job, get paid and move on and there's often situations where you have to choose between what is ""right"" and what'll see your men fed and paid for another day. 

Combat's deadly and can see your men bloodied, maimed and dead very easily if you get careless, however good use of tactics (and a little luck) means you can often turn unfavorable situations in your favor.

Summary:
Quite simply one of the best games I've played in the last few years.
Turn-based tactical resource-managed RPG heaven with mercenaries.

1 hour in...
Nice!  Seems a bit like a turn-based Mount & Blade.  Decent graphics and gameplay easy to pick up so far.

10 hours in...
Wow!  This is pretty good.  Much better than I hoped for in an early access game.  Love the 'tabletop' style figures in the tactical battles and the way they change with different armour and damage taken.  Decent amount of quests so far and hopefully more to be added as the game develops.  Tactical battles offer quite a challenge and often require distinct strategies to win (although that could just be down to my ineptitude!).  Definite M&B comparisons, which is a good thing as far as I'm concerned.  Definitely worth some more game time...

50 hours in...
Who'd have thought that managing a  mercenary company could be so much fun?  The premise is simple: travel the world, fight things, complete quests, build up your company, travel a bit more, fight some even nastier enemies, complete some more difficult quests... and then cry as your best warrior gets decapitated by an orc (RIP Gunther the Mutton-Molester).  This game is tough, but definitely rewarding and enjoyable.  The strategic map phase integrates well with the turn-based tactical combat; character progression is simple and having the right skills can make the difference in a close fight (no random mass of vaguely useless skills here and the same tactic won't work every time with every opponent).  Quests are well-written and (so far) haven't become a grind.  Oh yes, the music is great too and suits the game perfectly.

100 hours in...
Out of early access at last - best thing I've played in ages!  Word of praise for the writing (again) - even after 100 hours, I'm still turning up different quests and haven't spotted too many grammatical errors.  In fact, I'm still actually reading the text rather than simply closing it, then going from A to B, killing C and rescuing D so that I can escort them back to X and claim Y as a reward.  The three late games crises add something different and prevent the game fizzling out, although they can often prove a bit hard even for an experienced company to handle.  Overall, a great game I will certainly be investing more time in.",1480245903,1511697544,True,0,0,0.495386123657226563,0,True,False,True,76561198007343486,320,1,40330,0,18423,1599838638,,

The combat system is amazing, and good decision making is required on the harder levels - from battle formation to gear selection.  All enemy types (humans, ghouls, goblins, orcs, etc.) are unique, and provide completely different challenges. Randomly-generated maps provide a different experience each game. Terrain is a huge factor during combat, and some maps are more mountainous and forested than others. 

Inventory management is important, but not overburdening: Food goes bad, ammunition needs to be replenished after every battle, weapons and armor degrade and sometimes break.

Roster management is a great new feature: Injured brothers can be sent to the reserves to rest and recuperate. Brothers will also lose morale if they don't see enough battle (future update).

General idea: This is a top-down isometric rpg/tactical turn based type of game with a strong emphasis on group building/planning. You play as the leader of a mercenary group in a grim low fantasy world with orcs/monsters/knights/ all sorts of other things.
Pros: The game is well made with 
- a consistent and enjoyable art style 
- Challenging and well developed gameplay
-diverse play styles/strategies/tactics
Cons
-Unforgiving combat
-Some unwinnable encounters

This is a great game of sandboxing the life of a mercenary. I would nearly liken it to final fantasy tactics minus the magic elements and there is no strong driving narration. As mentioned previously its very much a sandbox. Your choices are your choices and ultimately your fun will be derived from your personal goals.

I've played since early access and I'm never encountered a bug (although I'm sure they might exist), my play time has been flawless.

Pros:
Fun combat.
Decent customization for your Mercenaries.
Sandbox (There are random events that drive a 'brief story or theme', but overall theres no actual story)
Scripted and random events add some rich flavor to the game. (They occur pretty frequently too)

Cons:
Sandbox (I'll list this as both, because theres no storyline per say, you choose your own goals and adventures)
Somewhat repetitive. (The life of a mercenary is all about taking jobs and earning gold, but after sometime that life can grow weary)
-Expanding on the 'reptitive' con: combat, while fun, can draw out in regards to tactics. Undead, or Orcs, after a few encounters you get a taste for their tactics and there's no deviation.

so as for cons, game gets very repetitive, contracts are almost ALL the same, no dynamic map where houses could develop the land, and give us a reason to fight for, hoarding money is just what you do with no purpose at all, no sisters, no workshop or mod support (and this one was one of the promises), devs just said its finished and moved to another title giving no shit to their player base who paid for this game.

Is it worth 10, or 15 euros? yes... it is, but 30 euros is a rip off

22,37369474,english,"Battle Brothers is like a very simplified turn-based verison of Mount and Blade with elements from Darkest Dungeon and Mordheim: City of the Damned sewn in. 

You command a warband and each recruit is different due to random backgrounds, traits and appearances given to them. These unique traits interact differently in combat as well as to others in your group and the world around them. 

There are ingame events that make the world seem a bit more lively such as random encounters, noble house wars and orc invasions. They add more depth to your story and give you some interesting choices to make.

Quests can get repetitive, but sometime events can occasional change up the contracts.

Combat is straightforward with hits and misses determind by RNGesus. As your warband increases you will need to specialize your men and assemble formations to insure that valued soldiers survive for later game fights. Yes, some of your men are destined to be cannonfodder. Make sure it not your prized Iron Lungs Twohander Hedge Knight.

Finally, the artwork and music for this game went beyond my expections. Images have exquisite attention to detail from character injuries to armor damage depending on if you sustained any in combat. The soundtrack is amazing. There is an appropriate theme for every enemy type you face, ranging from the astounding trumpets of noble houses to the despair inducing choir of the undead legions. 

Oh, and free DLC that adds norse serpent-like dragons to hunt. Exactly what this game needed!

23,37355763,english,"It's a savage, difficult, unforgiving, and somewhat random game that is also addictive, fun, and satisfying.  The first few playthroughs will be brutal and you will die.  I couldn't cut it on Ironman so I had to switch to save-point game and even then my band of mercs would be murdered early on.  You need to learn your enemy.

What's so fun about it is developing strategies to fight all the different combinatons of enemies and monsters.  However, those strategies can sometimes not work which adds a dynamism that is hard to find elsewhere.  Positioning is important like Chess.  Terrain plays a huge role.  There's more strategy involved than what you see on the surface.  You need to position your tanks and your demolishers to best utilize their skills and support them with a myriad of other dudes.  I personally really like throwing weapons.  Manage your fatigue, build your shield wall and occupy the tougher enemies, rush their ranged troops, just lots of options.

I really like the artwork and the random encounters on the world map can be quite funny.  The money/food/repair/healing mechanic is challening and keeps you on your toes.  The sound effects are really fun too and it's satisfying when your slayer lops off the head of an enemy, bursts into his berserk skill, turns around and cuts another man into two large pieces.  Or when your shield master is holding off 3 tough enemies by himelf so the rest of the squad can whittle down the fodder elsewhere

I like the injury mechanic, sometimes it's rather harsh but I've found that high level characters with a permenant injury are still very useful.  For example, my throwing weapon dude coulnd't move much because of a broken knee and a maimed foot but by god the man could throw javelins and slay orcs like a boss.

What's missing is a way to make money that doesn't involve combat.  Occasionally you can deliver messages or escort someone to another town and avoid fighting but what would help a lot is being able to invest in a business like Mount and Blade.  Buying a mill, brewery, copper mine, etc.  That would make for a fantastic expansion and being able to settle your own town or outpost like the brigands.

We got a 1.0 release that is a full-fledged game and then got some follow on updates that have fixed almost every common bug.
The combat is deep and challenging and can be adjusted to those just getting into the game all the way to those that like to run their mercenary company along by a shoestring.
Random maps and different company combinations have kept me coming back.  
The game due to early access and post launch support feels very balanced at veteran difficulty and economy for a average skill level player like myself.
Only one enemy type feels unbalanced (I am looking at you Necroservant) 
There are plenty of enemy types and loot to make you want to play each game out to 300-400 days.  And the maps being randomly generated seeds means you will want to play multiple campaigns.  
So far for the asking price I have gotten 160+ hours out of the game which is near the top of my most played games for 2017 in a year that has been one of the most depressing of my gaming life when it comes to AAA games.  

In the end, would I like to see more content?  Of course.  Would I be willing to pay for said content?  Yes, I enjoy this game so much I would spend more on it.
But in my own life I have experienced burnout when working long term on a project so I can understand if the development team wishes to move on.
If they had had left us with a game that still felt like a beta I would understand negative sentiment, As it stands they left us with a finished product and a damn good tactical turn based RPG product at that,
And that alone means this is one of my top 5 games of 2017.  

One last note is that earlier in the year I purchased a Microsoft Surface Pro 4 for work purposes.  I was under no illusion that it is a gaming system.  But it does have Steam installed and its always nice when I can find games that run well on it.
Not only does Battle Brothers run at a constant 60 FPS but the game itself supports the Pro 4's odd native resolution and has in game support for UI scaling which is rare and very nice to see for very high DPI screens that some ultra light notebooks have these days.
So, the game gets a little extra love from me that an independent developer added those two nice touches.

First and foremost I prefer to play this game on ironman on the hardest diffiiculty, just because of preference. So this will affect my review a little bit compared to people who dont play on this mode.

This game is all about making the best out of the situations you are placed in. It is by no means an easy game and death is part of the game. The game is focused around combat and with basic supply items such as food, money, and tools to keep yourself in the fight. I will break the game down by the combat and management aspects mainly since they are what the bulk of the game is about.

The combat is amazing and you really need to think and strategize with your formations and loadouts. This is not a gamewhere you can just give everyone the highest damage weapon and best defensive armor and win. You have to keep in mind that this will hinder movement, sight, and attacks. You have to equip each character realistically in what you want to do with them. IE if you want a front line with high defense to keep your polearm users and bowman safe you will have to keep in mind that they will have a slow walk forward and will be susceptible to flanks and other ranged attacks. Your bowman cannot wear the best helmets that cover their face or their range will be hindered forcing you to get dangerously closer to the enemy. I could keep going but I think you get the point you must match your equipment to the character. 

Secondly the combat imitates realism in battle by giving advantages to the high ground, solid ground, and surrounding an enemy. This further impacts the need to be tactical and actual use strategy. There is no just rushing down enemies, even the easier battles can result in you losing an experienced fighter if you are not careful. The game will give you alittle leeway in the fact that sometimes character will only get seriously injured instead of permadeath, but I still cant figure out what causes a real death or injury since they look the same when they lose all their hitpoints besides being decapitated.

So to the management side. Its pretty basic but it makes sense. There is no need to overcomplicate things and this game did a nice job balancing this. You have to pay your troops and they have to be fed if not you face them deserting you and losing them forever. The way this is tracked is by their morale so you will have some sort of idea if they are getting close to leaving. Losing battles and eating the cheapest food will negatively impact morale while winning battles, getting drunk, or eating high quality food will increase morale. Obviously not eating or getting paid will be huge impacts. Other things to manage are ammo, tools, and medicine. The biggest one out of these three is going to be tools, you have to account for the upkeep of your armor or weapons or they will become useless. Expect to pay alot of money for your tools especially if you had a really hard battle or fled. Medicine and arrows are alittle less used and depend on how bad you get rocked in battle and if you utilize alot of archers.

This game is amazing and really makes you think. The people that cry about this game are without a doubt unable to adapt and learn from their mistakes.

Of all the TBS games I've played this game has the most detailed combat system. The tactical considerations include surround bonus, terrain and height, injuries, equipment, morale, fatigue, time of day, etc...

I want to talk about injuries and equipment because that's where BB stands out. There is a lovingly crafted injury system that really adds to the emergent narrative of the game. Injuries follow common sense rules and correspond with whether the recipient of said injury was hit in the head or torso as well as the type of weapon which dealt the blow. Maces and hammers result in crushed and broken bones, while swords and arrows result in pierces and gashes. All the injuries provide corresponding penalties. Each of the weapons types plays differently and the equipment of your enemies is visible so you can target according to enemy weapon type and armor. These little touches add so much to the realism of the combat, beyond just a hit chance and health point equation.

The systems these devs put in place make this turn-based combat actually FEEL like two small groups engaging in a brutal and bloody melee. I haven't even mentioned the sound effects.

This game is procedurally generated tactical combat in a procedurally generated Kingdom infested with bandits, undead and orcs.

The tactical combat especially shines. It is utilitarian and not cluttered. It is varied and chaotic. Although it is turn-based, it generates suspense as you cross your fingers waiting to see if you favorite brother will be struck down by the enemy's blow. People complain about the RNG, but I firmly believe that any game with perma death will get this criticisim. So I don't think the RNG is terrible, I think people just have a hard time dealing with bad luck.

You will need  to take contracts to pay your current brothers and hire new ones as you suffer causalities. Escort caravans, explore the wild and clear out enemy strongholds. The enemies in the wild are all acting towards their own goals, which often mean ruin for the settlements of humans on whom you depend for coin and supplies.

1) Start off as a band of broken apart brothers who find themselves in a low fantasy, realism based, persistent medieval kingdom divided into three bickering human factions, undead legions, greenskin hordes, and a variety of dangerous beasts.
2) Reform your mercenary company so that you can roam the lands taking on contracts that the local peasants and lords pay you to fulfil, as times are hard.
3) These contracts vary from running delivery errands, chasing thieves, clearing out threatening enemy hideouts, protecting towns from dangerous threats, and an abundance of other various procedurally generated lore rich quests to earn your party gold and a reputation among the locals. Not to mention the newly added ambitions that give long term goals full of rewards and positive moral buffs for your wavering soldiers.
4) The game also allows for free exploration of the randomized map your mercenary company has unfortunately chose to make their rough start in.
5) Battle Brothers also allows you to choose your own destiny on whether to be on the side of good and fend off the evils of the realm in order to gain a legendary reputation, roam the land and just watch the world burn as you and your mates get rich off the suffering of others, or even take the fight to locals by attacking town militias/ armies and raiding valuable rich caravans as a bandit company.
6) In the final patch of the game that launched this game out of the Early Access curse (though Overhype Studios did a fantastic job in the years of BB development addressing issues as they popped up), was the late game crisis mechanic that adds a megaton of events, new threats, difficult and very unique quests, and very difficult enemies that created an ever looming threat upon your world in which you can fight off.

The game is also packed full of nuances and details that make the world alive and more of an RPG experience by including features such as: 
- Limitless recruits with unique gameplay impacting backgrounds that come with unique stats and events tied to characters that allow for your group to develop through various roleplaying elements. 
- Skill upgrades that go beyond a level cap allowing you to bond with your brothers in arms if they have it in them to survive for that long.
- A perk tree full of viable, balanced character builds that allow for variety in your mercenary's team composition.
- Unique weapons and armour earned through hard battles or by hard earned cash that go beyond what you can purchase from the merchant stores.
- The game also is packed full of a great multitude of pop up events that occur while you are out on the world such as events that:[spoiler] increase your brothers stats through risky training, finding a lonesome crusader who wants to help fight back the undead scourge, an ambush of deadly undying creatures hidden inside of a box you were supposed to deliver, and even the murdering of one of your brothers.[/spoiler] Along with a multitude of other undiscovered quality of life events that guide your journey.

I could go on and on about the features of this great and glorious game, but I believe that the ""About this game"" and ""Features"" sections on the Store Page speak for themselves on other features involving: tactical battles, enemy diversity, open world and permadeath features that this game has to offer.

[b]Noteworthy Concepts:[/b]
With Battle Brothers being a permadeath, character loss, click to move, open world, medieval, strategy, RPG game it can be compared to other games that fit the genre such as: the roguelike narrative Darkest Dungeon, or the rags to riches simulator Mount & Blade: Warband. Elements of these games you would think fit the world setting of Battle Brothers such as: player town conquering, homebase castle creation, diplomacy, predetermined questlines, and large battle companies. Just do not fit developer choice of making the game focus on your personal party of rugged mercenaries, and these requests just do not keep the game in the mercenary procedurally generated narrative that makes this game so great.
If you decide to get this game, feel free to expect to put anywhere from 50-1000+ hours into the game. Any less than the minimum would be a disservice to the title as you couldn't possibly experience what this game has to offer in a shorter amount of time.

65,36838255,english,"At first glance, Battle Brothers appears to be a turn-based cousin of the Mount & Blade series of games.  Both games have you play as the leader of a band of mercenaries and have a similar core gameplay loop:
[olist]
  [*] You talk to villagers and receive quests or requests.
  [*] You recruit prospective mercenaries, buy provisions, manage inventory/equipment before setting off.
  [*] On an over-world map, you move to your destination (usually a battle)
  [*] You fight.
  [*] Loot after winning (usually game over if you lose).
  [*] Return to the quest giver and get paid.
  [*] Go to another village, potentially with trade goods to get extra money.
[/olist]
Battle Brothers spices things up in a variety of ways.

[h1]Basics of the game[/h1]
The size of your mercenary company is limited to 20 brothers (there is almost no female representation in this game).  They can come from many walks of life.  In the beginning of the game, when you are constrained by low funds, you'll likely find yourself surrounded by farmers, miners, fishermen, and other downsodden physical laborers.  The price of these men is low.  The cost of hiring these sorts is about as much as the cost of 3 weeks of food.  For a decent suit of chainmail, you could hire a group of 5 men.  But then again, life is cheap in the world of Battle Brothers.

Assuming they survive your first few battles, these brothers will level up and you can decide what stats and perks the brother should invest in.  There are 8 stats in this game (HP, Fatigue, Resolve, Initiative, Melee attack/defense, Ranged attack/defense) and you can choose 3 to increase upon each level.  However, the degree of increase is somewhat random (from 1 to 6 points).  Each character usually has some specialties (denoted by 1 to 3 stars next to the stat) that have a higher probability of rolling a higher increase.  The stat rolls also depend to some extent on the character's actions (give a brother a bow, and his ranged attack rolls will be higher).

The game does a good job with making these stats understandable.  For example, Melee attack is the chance to hit with a melee weapon.  Melee defense is the chance [i]not[/i] to get hit by a melee weapon.  When calculating a hit, the most simple scenario is:
[code]Chance to hit = Melee attack of attacker - Melee defense of defender[/code]

Most of the content is up to the player to discover.  The game implicitly nudges you to experiment with tactics, weapon types, and unit compositions.  Different enemies generally require different equipment.  An early example is the difference between fighting bandits and wolves.  Against bandits, you'll want some blunt weapons for tearing apart armor.  But against beasts, a thick wall of spears will make short work of them.

[h1]Things done well[/h1]
[list]
  [*] The game keeps a things interesting by gradually ramping up the difficulty and variety of the world.  In the first few days, you might be limited to hunting down bandits and the occasional pack of Nachzehrer (cannibalistic ghouls).  As weeks pass, undead, goblins, orcs, and heavily armored bandits show up.  And after months (if you survive that long), you're faced with ""end-game"" events of massive scale and lethality.  Don't expect to experience every encounter in a single playthrough.
  [*] Each class of equipment has its purpose and forces you to carefully consider your equipment for trade offs.  It doesn't work to give everyone heavy plate armor, especially if you want them to be able to move.  Or perhaps you like the accuracy bonus afforded by spears, but then find yourself helpless against skeletons (whom are hard to poke more holes in).
  [*] A loot system that makes sense.  Every piece of equipment held by an enemy killed in battle can be looted, provided they don't get destroyed in the battle.  
[/list]

[h1]Demerits[/h1]
[list]
  [*] The random nature of the battle system may be infuriating at times, especially since you know the chance for each attack to hit or miss (the game also helpfully provides a log with the rolls).  It can be game-ending when you miss several high probability attacks in a row and then get killed by a low probability headshot (by an enemy that probably should have been dead).
  [*] You don't really have the freedom to be ""bad"".  Your access to higher paying quests is generally gated by Reputation (a measure of successful quests).  Higher pay means more money to buy better equipment.  So if your reputation does not grow high enough (or you take short-sighted decisions to betray the quest givers), you'll soon find yourself outmatched by any random enemy in the wild.
  [*] The world is procedurally generated, so it doesn't always have a good layout.  Usually the locations of quests are a short distance away from the village.  But there is no consideration of whether there are any mountains or seas between you and the quest location.

69,29828767,english,"Battle Brothers is either a mixed bag, or a guaranteed winner, depending on what your style of gaming is. There's little to the game save for the battles and company management; e.g there's no story, no real discerning plot or reason to keep going other than for a purely gameplay stance, but what it does have it does so excellently you'll never care otherwise. Battle Brothers is an extremely solid turn-based Strategy, focusing on a band of mercenaries and the small land they roam in. Don't come into this game thinking you'll find a nitty-gritty, low-fantasy Medieval stimulator, because Battle Brothers has plenty of magic and mysticism, giving it a ""high-fantasy"" feel of sorts. You'll face off against the living dead, giant wolves, orcs and goblins in the fashion of an average Fantasy setting. This may be a a plus or a minus for some, so decide on if you're OK with what is portrayed, or if you're not quite interested. Battle Brothers is an amazing example of what ""Early Access"" games should do, and how they should do it; - Consistent updates, dev blogs, community feedback and a finished-game release date that is going to meet its goal. If you're looking for a solidly enjoyable TBS with great developer input and a good price, Battle Brothers will meet your expectations and exceed it. My personal hopes ride on modding support to be implemented, and plenty of community work to change the game to the tastes of how you'd like.

Overhype Studios deserves every cent they make off of Battle Brothers, and if you really enjoy it, consider the Supporter Edition. You're helping out good Developer practice!

Did not acualy expect this game to be as good as it was.  Yes the graphics are nonexsistent. Yes there is heavy dicerolling. But it feels more Xcom then Darkest Dungion. High leathalty for your dudes, yes, but also for the enamys. And this is comeing from someone who hates realistic games.  Simple to play and learn, but it has a HUGE amout of deapth when you dive into it, from the different weapon classes, some more effective against armor then others, to the orgainisation of your troops, to the manageing of loot and equipment. The basic gameplay loop is the same every time, go to town, get mission, fight dudes, get paid. There is little in the way of overarching story, except that witch you create for yourself.

As an example from my own game, I give you the story of Halston. 

With the company from the very begining. Prefers big two-handers, and is also the most fearless and resolved in the party. As a result, he becomes company Sargent, and carrys the battle standard into battle. He allways gets first pick at loot, and plenty of crowns were spent on sets of mail purely for his own use. Dispite useing a reach weapon, he leads from the frount. Gets cocky in battle, but never loses his cool. But he does see his share of friends die. Eventraly, turns to drinking. Witch, while not the best habbit, rases his resolve even higher. So that even when all seams lost, he lands a lucky crit with his battle standard, and sounds his horn, turning the tide of more then one battle. As a result, he's earned the title of ""The Bro"" and has become the sort of person I actively restreat from fights to save.

Pros:
- Progression can be felt from start to finish. You will really start to feel your people getting stronger the better weapons and armor you get and the more veteran they become
- Forces smart decision making as you need to manage which contracts you can and should take to get the highest profit with the lowest risk. 
- Emphasizes company management as resources are limited. Do you hire an extra person to bolster your numbers or upgrade the armor your current people have?  

Cons:
- Big battles take a long time to resolve especially when fighting with friendly AI.  It should make it feel epic but only makes it boring playing a >30 min battle
- Enemy AI isnt very smart when you take advantage of engagement/proper placement. They will just throw themselves against your set-up shield wall and die to the meat grinder
- Once everyone in the party is engaged, it becomes a slugfest to see who can outlast each other

Simply said, if this game looks fun to you, it will be!

The campaign screen is basically Mount & Blade. That being said, there are not nearly enough surprises to it. You can only take one quest at a time, and journeying to that location rarely involves surprises or interruptions -- if so, just one. It's kind of refreshing, because you don't have to pay attention during the journey. But could use a lot more variety. You don't care what quests are at all, just walk somewhere and fight a battle. The one variation is that on a certain type of quest, you get offered more money to betray your employer. But that variety only underlines how little of that there is in the game.

The turn-based battles almost all involve the same line of enemies running at you at the beginning. There are a few types of monsters and a few types of humans. 10 hours in, I'm still happy to fight them, but it needs some different setups.

and nice caravanquests where you cant visit the towns you go through during the escort, but be glad, you will visit the sympathetic looking orc-beserkers coming to you already seen from miles away.

also some kind of minimap or such to see exactly where caravans or transportquests are going to lead you before you accept said quests (which are the only not-level-3-quests in 5 villages around) would be ... too much?

Unfortunately, fate hardly ever deals a fair hand. Most of the men who have joined up over the past twenty four days have been left where they have fallen; on the battlefield. I've watched as these green recruits have been struck down, time and time again. Tormel was struck low by an arrow, a lucky shot, fired by a weaseling bandit. It was his first combat with the Company. Gulfrich was slaughtered mercilessly by Orcs, almost split entirely in half by a mighty blow with a crude axe.

Many of these men had hoped to make a name for themselves, only to be trampled into the ground, nothing but a short lived memory. People say that the dead and gone live on forever as memories.... I have found this to be false in the case of mercenaries like us. As those who remember them, soon meet a similar fate...

------ I haven't reviewed a game on steam before, but if I were only allowed to recommend one game, it would be Battle Brothers.

My review won't be based around the technical aspects of the game, many other reviews do that, and I am pleased with how the game is played. My review is more based around how you feel while playing it. I've never had such a deep emotional struggle while playing a game without a linear story, before.

Battle Brothers takes you for an emotional journey as you build up your band of mercenaries, and complete contracts, to earn glory, fame, and of course, gold. You hire men from different backgrounds, to fill in your battle lines and quite frequently watch them die. They could be with the company for a day, they could be with them for a month. None of your mercenarie's survival is a sure thing in Battle Brothers, and when you make a strategic error, your men pay with their lives.

I quite enjoy Battle brothers, and without the linear story, I'm set to use my imagination to make up their stories as I play. 10/10 and four thumbs up.

--UPDATE--
Some people have given the studio flak for releasing the game and stopping development. Here's what I have to say about it.

Battle Brothers accomplishes everything it set out to be at the start of its development, and accomplishes it well. The game had not been abandoned, but actually finished from early access and worthy of a full, finished release. 

They said that they would continue to provide bug fixes, tweaks, etc. Which they have followed through with and done, and now they're throwing in a completely unexpected content update for free. Other studio's have sold less content than this update to consumers under the guise of it being DLC many, many times before so this shouldnt be a problem whether you consider it free dlc, or just a content update.

Anyone who demands or expects more from these developers on this particular title(No matter how Absof***inglutely awesome it would be to get), is just selfish and ignorant to the fact that there comes a time where a studio needs to wrap up a project, and look to new things.

Edit 1: Still playing and still enjoying it thoroughly. This game is very punishing. You cannot get cocky or over confident. Your squad WILL get wiped out if you're not careful. I have tried Iron man several times and have lost more squads than I can count.

Edit 2: The game is fully released now and WOW, what a game! The devs really took this project seriously and set the example of what an early access project should look like. Steady updates, listening to the comunity but sticking to their original concept and developing a rather robust game with the potential for growth. 

Congratulations on a fantastic product. Not much more to say from my early access review. GET THIS GAME!

Edit 3: This is for all the crappy reviews and people flapping their ungrateful, arrogant, entitled face holes.

I dont understand why there are so many ""critics"" saying that the game was abandoned. 
I've been following this game since very early access, and for a very SMALL team, they were a shining example of early access done right. Consistent comunication and updates. They delivered in what was promised and more, it was released on time and in a polished state.

In a sense I feel that the hate comes from love. 
We want more of this game, we want more depth. But truly if you thought the game was so sh*ite, why bother with all the bitch*ng? Yes, I've wanted to punch my computer after losing an entire band to RNG sh*t rolls. Yes, sounds can become repetitive. Yes, item variation is not huge, but the content is there.

Also, not every game ever made will have modding, deal with it. Is it a bummer? Yes. I'd love to make all kinds of item variations. More armours, shield designs, etc. But it is not there, DEAL WITH IT.

11,36332953,english,"[u] What is it? [/u]
It’s a hexed grid wargame that only allows set in a middle ages world with some fantasy elements that allow you a maximum of 12 units into battle. If you don’t play tabletop games terms it’s a turn based squad based strategy game on a 6 direction grid (as opposed to a 8 direction grid like chess squares) with some terrain effects, a bit of micromanagement, rpg elements and some story. 
Like the xcom and jagged alliance series you are allowed to choose exactly what weapons and armour each of your units is carrying, which skills they should progress in and (xcom series) even their name and appearance if you wish.

[u]What makes it different? [/u]
I’ll admit to never playing much of the Civilisation series or being much of a wargamer. I have however spent my share of hours on turnbased squad based strategy series Jagged Alliance and Xcom. The hex grid with elevations is a very interesting concept that you can use effectively with the right troops. He who controls the high ground controls the battle but your enemy knows this as well and sometimes you just have to retreat from an unwinnable battle. 
Another interesting aspect is the added personalities which makes me feel the gamedev spent some good time on a D20 RPG. If you have  just the right character for the right event you can get a bonus that improves morale to the party. However I found these events a bit too rare (although realistic) to really stick. Also I was losing men so quickly I lost track of what made them different and simply replaced the position. ‘I need another spear and shield guy, Hey you’re free. You’re up!’

[u] What did I like? [/u]
The idea of giving each character a backstory and abilities makes you want to care about them. There is an interesting mix that change the numbers for most things in the game from morale change, chance to desert, melee defence, ranged attack etc. Also some of them fit the theme very well, for example there is an asthmatic who has lower resolve/ stamina or an apprentice who is able to learn faster. 
It was also welcoming to see that there is a good mixture of different occupations willing to become sellswords for your party although it’s not properly explained how they each spend their coin. I’d almost imagine some of them would do some of their own shopping, perhaps additional food or decorate their armour somehow. Where does their money go?
The mixture of injuries adds an interesting narrative to the game as well. Each body part can be injured in a few different ways permanently and temporarily and as in those times there isn’t much you can do except sleep it off.  

[u] What didn’t I like? [/u]
I found the game a bit repetitive and this wasn’t helped by the lack of music and sound variety. The story elements when the characters interactive with each other or other travellers on the road are very welcome but a bit too uncommon for my liking. I’d surprised that the sellswords get along with each other so well despite their differences. Perhaps I’ve played too much of zafehouse and walking dead and expect the characters to automatically distrust each other. I would have expected more distrust against the deserters and the murderers in the party. Or at least grumbling of discontent against those that are paid more, eat more or run away from battle easily.  

The instant damage everytime you retreat is maddening. I understand a penalty for retreat but this seemed a bit punishing at times. A larger retreating space would have being welcome. The fact that you have to move all of your 12 individual units 1 at a time for 4 or 5 turns until they are all nicely aligned on the edge of the map is time wasting against an enemy that doesn’t give chase.

Apart from that perhaps by accident I reached day 120 and still do not have a late game crisis or anyway of resolving the game about from ‘retire’ This may have been a misclick when I started the game but I thought I left it on random. Also I set ambition to get renown to 2750 at about day 80?. However I have no way of seeing if we are getting any closer or further away from the goal. Some people suggest waving my mouse cursor over my name but I can’t find this stat.

Initially I was also upset at the learning curve as the tutorial is a hidden under scenarios but got past this after a few hours and a few failed campaigns.


[u] Should you buy it? [/u]
So conclusion time, is it worth buying? IIRC I got this on sale and am happy to say I’ve spend a good 30+ hours on it so far. I feel like there is room for improvement in a sequel or future DLCs and only buying it will show the gamedevs such extra effort is worth it. Do you play other similar genres and enjoy them?
Or Do you want a gateway game into tabletop wargamming with tape measures and lots and lots of dice rolling?

37,36191083,english,"Battle Brothers is definitely one of my favorite games in my library.  Highly recommended!  If I could give more than just a thumbs up, I would.  I think it's fair to say, however, that it's not for everyone, for a few reasons.  But I'll start with the positive first and why I think you should definitely purchase Battle Brothers (especially while it's on sale!).  My reviews tend to be lengthy so....TL;DR, buy it if you're into turn based strategy.  But expect a hard journey.

[h1]What I Like:[/h1]
For starters, the atmosphere of the game is really cool.  It does a really nice job of plopping you down into the gameworld, and from the very beginning, literally everything you do is up to you.  The music certainly adds to the atmosphere and is exceptionally well tailored to the game.  While I think all of the music is really good, I think some of the combat music really shines.  Some of the ambient presence in the game, like when you're in town, is a nice touch, although a bit repetitive at times.

The gameplay is awesome.  I've read some reviews that describe it as being repetitive after a while.  While this is true to a degree, I also feel that you kind of get out of it what you put into it.  In my current playthrough, I've almost completed a full year in-game.  It truly feels like my company is a crew of hardened, grizzled veterans.  One of my best members is missing his nose, has permanent brain damage and is almost always last to act in battle, but he hits like a truck and seems to survive the worst anyone can throw at him at this point.  A few others have been with the company since the beginning or very early on, and then there are some less seasoned fighters to fill the gaps that were left in losing some of my best members.  What I'm getting at is that you've got to have some interest in your crew, be invested in their personal story.  If you can't immerse your own imagination into the world of Battle Brothers, you will likely be one of those people who just sees it as being repetitive after a while.

Combat mechanics are really well executed.  I've seen numerous complaints whining about RNG and how it's ""too hard"".  It's supposed to be hard.  If you're just playing to always win and never lose anyone, you're playing the wrong game.  It doesn't hold your hand.  If you send a level 5 member with medium armor and a spear against an orc warrior, don't be surprised if you lose him.  That's not a fault of RNG as much as it is a lack of judgement.  The game is well balanced but hinges greatly on your ability to make good decisions.  Once you understand how to leverage things like morale, different weapon types/combinations, perks, etc. in your favor, the playing field starts to change.  Also it helps to realize that you have to approach a battle against orcs differently than a battle with the undead.  You could sum all this up in a single word:  [b]strategy[/b].  The more negative reviews I see that complain about RNG, the more I start to feel that a number of those negative reviews were by people who don't want to put much thought into the things I just mentioned.  

I feel that the late game crises deserve a mention too.  For those of you who just have to have an ending in a sandbox game, the late game crises are your ticket.  There are three of them, and they can change the map permanently (i.e. losing a settlement), and add some interesting events to the game.  At this point, I've completed all three, and I still continue to play, but after each one, you are given the option of retiring.  You can make a lot of gold doing quests during the different events, especially during the Noble Wars, and even more so if you've done a nice job getting your reknown up.  Also, the different random events that can happen at any time add a lot of flavor to the game.  The devs clearly put a lot of thought and imagination into these, and with over 100 hours of game time, I still have been running into events that are new to me.

[h1]What I don't like:[/h1]
Okay, call me a fanboy...but I honestly don't have much to put here.  I suppose there are a few small annoyances for me.  I'll admit that the combat, as much as I praise it, can be frustrating.  But the outcomes are always more interesting when you just play them through to the end.  

While I enjoy that the game really doesn't hold your hand at all, I do think there are times it could do a better job of at least pointing you in the right direction.  I can't think of any specific examples here though.  I did notice though that occasionally you'll get a quest where you're supposed to track someone down, and it says to follow such and such tracks west or wherever, but there won't actually be any tracks.  

Also, I've seen a few people mention that it'd be nice if there was a more detailed breakdown of budget for your party expenses.  That's a neat idea but honestly, the tool tip when you hover over your gold or supplies is 100% clear about how long they each will last you.  

[h1]Final thoughts...[/h1]
It's disappointing that there will be no more development for the game, beyond bug fixes and such, and that there is no modding.  For some, this is a deal breaker.  I'll still continue to enjoy it, but agree that mods would at least extend the life of the game beyond it's final development.  There's SO much that modding could bring to Battle Brothers.  But don't let that deter you from giving it a try, it really is an awesome game.  You just have to put a little bit of time and thought process into it, and I think that's fair considering that it's a strategy game.  Immerse yourself as the commander of your company, explore, and don't be afraid to lose a strong party member.  At the end of the day, the stories that arise out of your specific journey will make it very memorable.

If you read this far without falling asleep, you should go ahead and just buy the game already.  ;)

42,36166616,english,"Get this if you like turn-based tactics, medieval settings, and difficult games. Don't expect a strong roleplaying experience.

The combat is in my opinion the selling point of this game. It is difficult and every swing or movement can mean the difference between life or death. Victories are rewarding and the randomly generated maps greatly add to the replay value.

The game is essentially a loop of take on a mission, defeat some enemies, get rewards, gear up and supply your mercenaries, then repeat. It's ok if you like the combat. If you don't like the combat, you probably won't like this game and could safely refund it in 2 hours.

To the developers credit the writing is strong and decision to choose different end-game situations is cool.  But the game can become repetitive.

Do not listen to people who say this is like Mount and Blade without giving any explanation.

Unlike Mount and Blade, Battle Brothers does not have:
- a player character who battles and who you can upgrade
- the possibility to become a lord then a king
- the possibility to have your own castle and fiefs
- no raiding towns or cities
- horses
- a strong economic game. You can trade in Battle Brothers, but you cannot do it solely without forsaking essential experience for your mercenaries.
- tournaments
- a marriage system
- mostly importantly, mod support

I'll start with what I like. 
1. The art style Very 'cute' and board game style
2. Some decent roleplaying elements: characters havea  background and trigger events based on background, their mood, and other thigns that happen. Depending on traits youll get extra dialog options. 
3. Customizable equipment sets. If you want a guy that throws javelins before entering melee you have equipment slots for that. If you want a shieldwall with a polearm user behind stabbing out 2 squares ahead you can do that.
4. when your character levels up they get a few points to put into stats that are kind of random. And decent perks
5. While your characters lose HP in battle they will get injuries which reduce their stats

What I hate.
1. Archers.... Archers will murder all of your archers. They always seem to hit the guy behin my shieldwalls
2. Your archers seem to never be able to hit. This is on top of the problem that you could just be relaly unlucky with dice rolls
3. The game scales itself to meet your level and power. but if you lose a guy you have to get a new guy usually around level 1 and they will get murdered in their first fight. 
4. The game has dice rolling for attacks and is painfully random. i have seen 80% chance to hit miss 4 times ina  row. 
5. Critical hits are 'head shots' and helmets seem to explode on impact when hit. 
6. Elevation and camera angle. There is one camera angle and trees or other terrrain makes it impossible to see where anyone is in relation to another. I have lost so many guys because i couldnt tell the enemy was behind a tree. 
7. Escort missions should have a time table when you accept the quest so you know whether or not you can pay your guys enough on the way there. 
8. Liimited battle starting posiiton. You get a 2X10 grid to palce your guys on without seeing the enemy and you could start out the fight witha ll your guys submerged ina marsh with -25 to all rolls.

The bad: 
-the graphics put me off buying the game for a long time. After playing the first hour I grew to like them, but the characters are only rendered as a torso with head and equipment. This feels a bit ugly at times.

The good:
- best turned-based strategy game I've played, including xcom 1+2. You get to choose character equipment, formations and character build through a solid leveling system and see what happens in combat. Every choice matters and you get plenty of moments where you feel like a hero slaying the last monster with the last arrow from your last uninjured dude.

- Great immersion. The game makes you feel like a badass mercenary by a combination of high risk/high reward decisions, text-based interactions with the various factions and settlements and global events that put you to the ultimate test.

- Replayability. I've played a bunch of hours and can already tell this will be a game I'll play regularly. I wouldn't be surprised if I got a couple of hundred hours of fun out of it.

Here are some of their tips! dying is Fun. Get use to dying its part of the game. Play it on hard like its meant to be. Exspect to loose your men. yes those are the ingame fvcking tips they give you!!!

Any positive review is written by some dvmbfvck who is in bed with the devs because this game is NOT easy nor is it fun!! hogwash

No healing, no magic, and very limited skill tree with insignificant skills.
no magic yet orc shamans can cast entangle on 4-6 of your guys!
no magic yet necromancers can summon undead
where is the cure light wounds, or the fireball?
 this game is way to hard! even on easy setting!!
the only good thing is the save option! yes i have played almost 80 days in the campaign and now have 12 guys all around 10th lvl and have only EVER had 1 guy die!!! yes its that easy!!! if you save, reload, reload, dont do that battle, pick and choice....wow what a cool lame game this is!

I hate games where you have to have

*healing supplies- heal you outside of combat-must maintance a stock of them in your inventory
*range ammo- used by your bows, auto refilled after battle as long as you keeep a stock of them
*tools to repair equipment-repair and maintain armor/equip after a battle. your armor is like extra   hitpoints and the damage done to you subtracts the armor first so after EVERY battle your armor needs to be COMPLETELY repaired
*Food-must have enough food per day to feed everyone, food also rots after a few days so you cant stock up
*Gold- enough gold must be kept to pay your guys daily!!!! yes daily!!! my bill is around 300 gold per day for my men

Now you say this wouldnt be so bad if the rewards are good in the battles.
Let me break it down for you.
at 1st lvl you have 2-4 guys, which needs armor and weapons also!!!
to maintain 12 guys it takes about 500 gold per day. every day!!!
most of the time you MIGHT fight once every 1-3 days  and on average each fights rewards give you from 20-400 gold!!! yeah!!!!
so you see it takes way to much to maintain your men, feeed them, pay them, heal them, fix their crap, and make sure they have ammo!

i just went into a fight and there were 40-60 oponents, needless to say they swarmed me and killed half my crew in the first 2 rounds....

the devs really stuck it to us this time!!! 
the ONLY way to survive is with the save option. and that gets to be a pain real quick!

67,36031603,english,"Remember the feeling of entering Morrowing and encountering an enemy for the first time? How, no matter how you spec your character or position yourself it seems like every attack you make fails or misses? When even the simplest of enemies can easily overwealm you, all because you can't actually hit the bloody thing? If you enjoyed that, Battle Brothers is the game for you. It has taken that feeling and packaged it up as a tactical, turn-based combat game.

You run a control a squad of up to 12 men. You need to feed them, equip them, and keep them happy. The last part is easy, since they won't be alive long enough to be sad. This is because all of their attacks will miss, and the enemy will kill them in one or two hits.

You have a choice between ranged and melee equipment. Different classes of melee equipment do different kinds of damage. For example, hammers are good against armour, and axes are good against shields. Or so I'm told. None of them will actually hit the enemy so it doesn't really matter which of the numerous health bars they don't affect.

Ranged weapons come in the form of bows and crossbows. You can fire a bow a couple of times each turn, and a crossbow uses all of your action points to reload and fire. It doesn't matter which you choose since neither will hit the enemy, although sometimes they will hit your own soldiers. 

There's also a few thrown weapons, like nets and axes. No idea if they're any good, I figured they'd probably miss.

It may seem like I'm just saying that you spend each turn missing attacks on the enemy. That's not true for EVERY turn, though. Sometimes you won't be able to make an attack. As well as the enemies, you also have to battle fatigue. In addition to 'Action Points' each action you take (like moving or attacking) also builds up fatigue. If your fatigue is too high you just can't attack. To reduce it, you skip your turn.

Money is earned by completing contracts. There's a bit of variety to these. Some of them are ""go over there and kill things"". Others are ""Stay here and kill things"". Sometimes you'll find a ""go over there, and you might not have to kill things"". Money earned for completing the contracts is really low. Early, 'easy' contracts will pay 100-200 gold. A crap new recuit will cost more than this, and a GOOD recruit will cost you about 2000-4000 gold. Same with weapons and armour. 

This is a beautiful game with some good ideas, but is let down by the uninteresting and frustrating combat. The balance is almost entirely non-existent. If this gets patched in the future I'd be happy to give it another go, but for now I'm done with it.

The game is unforgiving and I get that, I mean, that's part of the advertising. But I didn't realize that meant that in battles you'll have turns where you miss, miss, miss, and the enemies get a lucky crit, and all of a sudden your favorite guy is instantly dead. Of course there's no substitute for good strategy and if you're placing your soldiers tactically and wisely you'll lessen this, but there are still going to be battles where an enemy archer gets lucky and you're going to lose men. I like difficulty but this feels unfair and arbitrary, especially when you've perfectly placed a shieldwall and lol who cares your frontline is now butchered because the other guy succeeded on a swing that had a 1% chance to hit and now you're dead or crippled.

Battle Brothers is all about loss and overcoming challenges that seem impossible. In other words, it's just like XCOM (and X-COM) or Mordheim, where you develop certain attachments to characters out of sheer comradely survival. ""You made it one more battle,"" you think, and as you remember that the sturdy farmer with dreams of glory that you'd just picked up from a miserable small town was cut down by some dishonorable bandit you come to understand just why these guys benefit from getting drunk at taverns all the time. You want to forget the disasters in which half your company got slaughtered and the battles you fled from because your Captain heroically fell while raising your company's banner up high, serving not as an inspiring reminder of bravery to those around him in order to make them fight (fail) better, but as an alarming memento mori. But these catastrophes and battles fled are what define you and your mercenary company, not the victories and the heaps of gold you get from some dirty noble. The art is beautiful, and so is the music, which is constantly reminding you of tragedies past, signals only for the tragedies to come.

It's great how, as time goes by, just like in Mordheim the 'experience' of a soldier translates into mastery as much as it translates into what that mastery does to the body: a lost eye, a penchant for gluttony, a knee that no longer supports. Your soldiers bear that 'experience' in the scars of their flesh as well as the scars in their minds; they are made brothers in the assurance that they will die, not in the revelry of life. The battles are hard, and every enemy type needs different tactics as well as different equipment and formation - assume that the Orcs will fight like professional human soldiers, or bandits, or wild beasts, at your own peril. No one tells you how to fight different enemies - you need to figure it out the hard way, and you will make mistakes. The enemy variety is pretty decent, so even if you have a winning strategy against bandits, or orcs, or goblins, you'll usually need to mix it up and improvise mid-battle thanks to the randomly generated terrains. No two battles are the same, just like no two brothers are the same!

1,35745298,english,"I've been playing this game for a long time now, from the bare-bones to the released version. I'm not going to go into features that were discussed/promised and not delivered on, because the game is still great despite this. I understand people will be a bit ""BUT THEY SAID THEY'D DO THIS THAT AND THE OTHER!"" I really do. BUT, that aside, what the game has really works well and is worth a play.

As the leader of a fresh mercenary company it is down to you to provision, equip and prepare your guys for what you throw them in to. Do you think a band of 8 poorly armed people - peasants really, as that's who you hire in the beginning - can take on a large band of bandits? No, of course you can't. You have to take the piddly little contracts you know you can do to build up the skills and your money. It takes time, as you would expect. It can be hard - you might bump in to a large group and get screwed - but that's the game!

You lose people, you move on. You run away from battle and suffer injuries, you recuperate and go at it again. There can certainly be times when you'll lose almost everything and cannot recover. So what? Retire/quit and try again.

The gameplay has always been fun for me; turn-based movement and fighting, positioning your troops and holding the line, or charging headlong with a line of axe-weilding madmen! Turtling is not a valid tactic if they have archers, so you charge in, take some hits, lose some people, but then bring fire and fury upon your foe with axe and sword!

The world map is rather large and there's plenty to do aside from missions; find bandit hideouts, necromancer lairs, orc/goblin warcamps and take them on! This game is not about a group of invincible lads cutting people down like a field of wheat. It's hard, it's visceral. You will die. You will fail, but you will learn and do better next time.

The end game events are fun! Noble houses going to war and recruiting you to fight for them. Goblins and orcs ravaging the land and you aiding in their defense! There's also plenty of things that pop up as you're travelling and provide a nice change from the set battles you're used to.

I would recommend this if you're looking for something you can come back to time and time again, start a new game and just wallow for a bit y'know? I like those kind of games.

I forget where I was going with this.. I enjoy it, you might too if it's you're style of game, so why not give it a go?",1508068016,1508779972,True,36,0,0.729991793632507324,0,True,False,False,76561197971002689,367,12,8843,0,5706,1598045559,,

Pros:
Charming art style without being too demanding system-wise
Company management fairly engrossing and you'll miss your chaps when they die
Definitely challenging but in a nice way rather than a punch in the balls

Cons:
Still a lot of the overall depth and direction yet to be added, but it is coming
Could do with a bit more variation in items and strategic tools available
RNG will probably make you sad more often than it makes you happy

6,35915854,english,"[i]Unforgiving turn-based tactical fantasy battle simulator with a randomised strategic resource management layer[/i]

[list]
[*]Randomised campaign maps (with the option of using and re-using a particular random map seed, if you want)
[*]Simulates the management and life of a mercenary company, with a neat layer of random fluff events adding some characterisation to your mercenaries: manage food supplies (which will spoil), manage and repair your equipment, trade goods and sell off scavenged equipment, and - most importantly - ensure your coffers have enough coin to pay your mercenaries' daily wage
[*]Detailed and difficult combat that forces you to carefully plan and execute (especially difficult at start): manage the weapon types for the desired goal (hammers will smash armour, but won't cut off the head of a zombie - a sword will, but is weaker against armour), manage the stamina (heavy armour and special actions will tire your men faster), manage formation and have your mercenaries fight as a unit - or as lone wolves!
[*]Not a game for save-scummers or perfectionists who don't like losing even a single mercenary (mercenaries [b]WILL[/b] die; sometimes it's deserved, sometimes it's just RNG being really cruel to you)
[*]Detailed injury system resulting in short-term (but sometimes also permanent) maluses that often force you to adapt your battle lineup (either by rotating your mercenaries to a different position, or by having them wait the battle out in reserve)
[*]Interesting contract and faction system, with the possibility of crossing your employers, as well as turning to banditry and attacking peasants, trade and supply caravans (just hold CTRL and click; know that you will be hunted down - for instance by other mercenary companies!)
[*]Opponents include bandits and other human factions (other mercenaries, knights and soldiers), goblins (sneaky, but cowardly; both on foot and as wolf riders), orcs (very tough, absolutely brutal, luckily susceptible to morale hits), undead (skeletons, zombies, ghouls, ghosts) and other monsters.
[*]Recruit your mercenaries from all walks of life: from vagabonds, farmers and graverobbers to retired soldiers, raiders, adventurous nobles and knights; know that while your mercs continue to gain experience and improve, you shouldn't expect that farmer you recruited in the first village you ever visited to last the entire campaign - but who knows, maybe the boy had talent?

All the above said, while I recommend trying out the game, I have to stress once again, that it's not exactly the most casual one out there. Graphically the presentation is neat (with its characteristic ""upper-torso and head"" graphical design), albeit animation is almost non-existent. The sound effects work well to set the background of the battles and the places you visit and the music deserves a honourable mention.

One last thing worth mentioning is that while immediately after maturing from Greenlight (yes, the title was Greenlit) to a full release, the developers announced that their work was complete, but recently they seem to have reversed that stance, releasing a free DLC (with a new dangerous monster to beat). More glory to them, I say, if they've decided to continue supporting this product (and I have to add that I disagree with the sentiment they expressed immediately after release - I paraphrase - that any more work on this won't bring them any more money; wrong, continued support will continue to get more people to buy this, plus you win the good-will of your existing fans).",1508666254,1508666254,True,16,0,0.600066304206848145,0,True,False,False,76561197989125719,101,7,12168,0,2204,1590689542,,

He is dead now and I soon shall follow for the game is fucking difficult. RIP me.

44,35569863,english,"If I have two words to describe this game, it would be ""Frustratingly Fun."" I WOULD reccomend it, especially if you enjoyed the old PC game Darklands. It has that kind of flavor to it. The Germanic cultural feel, the extremely low magic setting, the group of mercenaries that you control who slowly upgrade their equipment and skills to face increasingly dangerous threats..... Battle Brothers is *WONDERFUL* under certain circumstances. 
I've played several different variations, and I have no idea how people play the game off of the easy setting. 

Creating your men from farmers and fishers into hardened warriors is nothing short of a time and brain investment, so when you lose a soldier due to a fluke or a bad tactic, you really DO feel regret at his death. This tension of taking risks to get money and win battles vs protecting and babysitting your fighters is what makes this game FUN. 

The equipment pacing is great, so is the turn-based tactical formation and utilizing your men according to their strengths and YOU are in control of it. Do you want to focus on a shieldwall? That's a valid tactic. Do you want a pike and spear line? That's a valid tactic. Do you want a bunch of ranged units who can swap to melee at the last minute? That's a valid tactic. 

THAT aspect of the game is just beautiful. Fun. Well paced and focused on short game battles to broadedn your mid range and the long game in terms of strategy. 

Why is it frustrating? 
WELP..... The game's difficulty curve is all over the place. When you first start a game, get ready to have your people killed a lot while you figure out how to get a shield wall figured out, and your best bet had better be the Greenskin Invasion or the Undead Scourge. If you pick Noble War, you'll get your butt kicked. Horribly. Their guys are extremely well equipped and they will outnumber you, and they will be able to run you down. I hate that mode and when it randomly crops up, I usually spend it dithering around looking for dungeons to loot.

For *SOME REASON*, the game maxed out *your* Battle Brothers at 12 men in combat at a time. That would be fine because it sharpens your tactical options, EXCEPT..... It certainly doesn't apply the same courtesy to your opponents. I think this is truly unfortunate, because it makes some battles, specific missions, or dungeon crawls flat-out unwinnable. When you have 12 men maximum and your opponent has 22, with superior equipment, and they can *fly* or *raise the dead* or *stun multiple people*, it makes no matter how tactical and clever you are, you're going to take expensive, time consuming losses.... Assuming you win, which you almost certainly won't. If you could use 20 against 22, you might win... But the game won't let you. 
Do you want to create a really quick overland squad that can get in, burn stuff, shoot arrows and get out? Too bad. THAT isn't an option and I wish it was. 

In other words, the early game is very well polished, and it has a lovely balance between gritty losses and slow, steady expansion of your mercenary group, their reputation and skills and equipment. I don't *mind* taking losses(as I said, that's part of the tension of the game), but after awhile, it's hard not to become attached to certain characters after they pull off various heroics. In the late game, when your early companions die off one by one to get replaced by other mercenaries, it's hard not to get annoyed or frustrated.... On one hand, it's a part of a mercenary game and it helps you figure out what works and doesn't on the tactical battlefield. 
On the *OTHER HAND*, it represents a serious loss in time investment. 
The game has good autosave policies, and the normal games allow to try the same battle multiple times. 
This is the part of the game that I both love, and over time I began to find frustrating, because in my opinion it established that there are some battles that are designed to be unwinnable. 
Some people love the ""I want a really expensive challenge"" aspect. Me? I'd like to see Battle Brother's late game polished a few more times. 

If I *had* to make a wish list for the game, I wish there was a way to break up larger groups of enemies somehow. 
I wish there was a way to make the War of the Noble Houses a little less impossibly difficult to participate in. 
I wish that the Vampires weren't so ridiculously hard to hit, and they weren't holed up in dungeons with 20 skeletons, who can teleport anywhere they want and isolate your people and pick them off with disgusting ease.... 

So much nit-picking on my part. Honestly, I love the game, and I'll go back to playing the game. 
I wish there were more games like it.

Even on the lowest difficulty, it's a challenge to get your company to a point where they're effective against even basic enemies. Even with high levels of armor, you will occasionally have high-level fighters die after a couple hits. It really doesn't make any sense. What's the point of leveling, if your level 7 guy gets killed just as easily as your level 1 guy. 

Then, to make matters worse, there is this concept of fatigue. The fatigue attribute goes up very slowly - so slowly that it's impossible to wear the best armor without having your guy be so fatigued from wearing it that they can't swing their sword.

Then, even if one of your guys dies, you often can't collect the armor after the battle. Where does it go? You save up lots of gold to buy a really nice set of armor for your level 7 guy, and then he dies, but after the battle you can't find his armor in the loot. What logic is that?

The game speed is horrible. You spend most of the game travelling from city to city, but even at double speed (the max), the company crawls across the screen. I spend most of my time watching my guys walk. 

Strategically, it's very simple. You have a small number of attacks that you can use. But, in practice, your guys don't have enough movement to position themselves to use the more advanced attacks. So, basically, you're just swinging swords. The terrain can barely be used to an advantage. And, you can't use formations to gain advantage either.

I put so many hours into this game, but I feel like it was lost time. Although fun in the early stages, it's not a game that is fun in the mid-to-late stages. Very frustrating and not in a good way.

So, if you are somebody that is very sensitive to price or prefer to play games that are actively under development or evolving, you may want to read through some of the other reviews before you buy or wait for sale.",1506036207,1506036207,True,19,0,0.60553973913192749,2,True,False,False,76561198010932149,501,5,85,0,85,1506038177,,
62,18154977,english,"After well over 300 hours in the game, I don't think I can recommend it. If this is as far as the development goes thenI don't think it can really be salvaged. Some people really enjoy the game, I do too on ""Beginner"" mode. But the moment you play it at any higher difficulty it just becomes a frustrating mess of Save state scumming and really odd battleinteractions. I feel like it gets too difficult too quickly, with the difficulty not being an ""obstacle"" to overcome per se but rather your chances of failing increasing if that makes sense. You repeatedly miss both strikes in a combat round
while opponents rarely miss both strikes in the same round. You have to constantly buy mercenaries to feed to opponents like sacrificial animals which for me kind've takes me out of the games immersion (Really badly) when I just wish that combat was less ""Flip a coin, alright you lose so this attack takes 3/4's of your soldiers life"" and more back and forth with strategic decisions. 

Really for a game that wants to portray itself as a strategy game you're really left up to chance more often than not. The mercenaries stats that you hire are random and unknown to you before hiring  (Oh you just spent 400 gold on that caravan guard? Too bad he's insecure and superstitious and will turn tail at the mere moment something goes wrong quicker than a deserter) So there's that, but then add on to that. You don't know The composition of the enemies you're fighting. (Ran into a bandit hunting unit, said ""Some poachers (Archers)"" and Some regular bandits (Forget the name). Well ""Some poachers"" is apparently 5 of them. Nice walking into an arrow hailstorm through fog of war lmao ) Or how about those quests “Hunt down what terrozizes (City name here). Can be goblin, undead, or werewolves. Well one of those is WAY more difficult than the others let me tell ya'! And early on in the game it's not like you can accessorize and equip for all three ya feel me? Or how about this, you still can't set up your men before the fight (WHAT!? I thought that was something that was eventually gonna' come down the line before they finished the game!!) I mean how can you really strategize all that well when you can't even place your men in strategic spots. Instead wasting early turns shuffling your men around to where you actually want them or (God forbid) Fighting a werewolf that instantly zeroes in on your archer before you can even move him and now he cant move or shoot because he's in zone of control. (BALONEY!)

Here's another thing that just happened in my game. Hired a mercenary, a monk. His description. ""Wants to leave his monastery, having heard of warrior priests. To emulate their bravery to go out into the world to destroy all that is evil."" Hire him, he has ""Fainthearted"" character trait which is -5 to his base resolve. It's stuff like that, that really makes you roll your eyes and question how you're supposed to take anything seriously in this game.

Also, also ALSO, the battlefield map is random! I've been so screwed over before by going against Goblin archers and the random map puts them all on top of a hill so my guys are climbing up and getting DESTROYED with arrows. What am I supposed to do? Retreat? Retreating is a chore too, you have to spend 5 minutes micromanaging your soldiers all to the edge of the map and then select “Retreat” from the interactive menu. You can just retreat right away without that sure but EVERYONE in your party suffers debilitating injuries. I could go on but you get the point.

66,35015383,english,"Battle Brothers is a fantastic low-fantasy, turn-based strategy game, styled after various tabletop board games like ""Cry Havoc"" and ""Seige."" Yet rather than playing out a single scenario, in Battle Brothers you'll be faced with the ongoing challenge of managing a mercenary company and all that entails: keeping your men fed and paid, ensuring morale doesn't become a liability, and finding work that won't get your sellswords killed. Come up short in any of these areas and you'll face desertion or doom -- but if you're cautious, cunning, and a little bit lucky you'll live long enough to become a legend.

The world's backstory is fairly understated. You can tease out some of it through completing fights and crises, but it isn't the focus of the game, and you'll mostly be left to guess and wonder at your exact relation to it beyond being a man who kills for coin. After all, you're no noble born. You just point your men at the nasty things that scream and bleed. History is for the historians, let the living exalt or fear your mercenary company as you make your own tale. How many wars can you decisively win for the noble house that hires you? How many greenskin hordes can you put down? And how many times will you return the risen dead to their graves before your legend is finished?

Aside from battles, your interaction with the world will chiefly be through random events. Are you the kind of mercenary leader who orders his men to rob a band of children on an ill-fated crusade, or are you the kind to help fix merchants' broken wagons? Your choices for the events are all straightforward, no nasty surprises that turn your good deed into something heinous, or your foul act into a blessing to those around you. 

Beyond fighting for various employers, you can venture out into the wild lands and hunt for weapons and armor of a more legendary stature, or just pick fights with the meanest foes you can find as a break from butchering bandits and driving dire wolves into extinction.

If any of that sounded appealing to you, you'll definitely enjoy Battle Brothers.",1505628623,1505628623,True,7,0,0.535825610160827637,1,True,False,False,76561198031108824,53,6,18899,0,18304,1581956002,,

It's a mercenary company simulator. Hire men, build up their stats and skills, equip them and watch them killed horribly by undead, wolves, orcs, other humans and the occasional Viet Cong goblin sniper shot from halfway across the map. Find contracts from penny-pinching nobles and townsfolk to take caravans across the country for less than your men get paid in day. Get into four fights along the way, and have vampires hop out of the shipping crates to forcibly retire your band. Or minmax your mercs to perfection and shit on everything short of an army three times your size. The casual gamer can have fun with this if you don't mind losing every now and again, but this game is a perfectionist's dream. 

No game short of Blood Bowl 2 will frustrate you more with dice. No game will reward you more when you find ways to overcome them. This game will break your heart, and go in dry with no lube. Other times, you'll wish you could make sweet passionate love to it. But it isn't an RNG shit-show. Minimize risk, position correctly, and come prepared. Do everything to swing RNG in your favor, and you'll be better off for it. 

You can't always win, but you never lose. And you'll always come back.

82,34770472,english,"The 'RPG' tag should be taken out; there is hardly any story at all. For the sake of argument, you could say that there was enough flavour text to draw out the world. You could also say that each character has its own story, and you would be correct on both counts. But an interpretation of the world and my subordinates' story isn't enough, I want *my* story, unique to myself where my decisions matter to the world.

For example, I wanted to be a bad guy from the start of the game. After the prologue of having my merry band getting slaughtered I wanted to gather more people like myself, set-up a hideout and ambush peasants going to and fro. Kidnap them, maybe hold ransoms and such. Running from the army to instead, kill small mercenary groups, the kinds of which I was once in. But to continue the story, you have to play the good guy route. Fair enough, most RPGs just takes the player along a particular route and it does not offer two different choices. Still I was disappointed from the lack of freedom.

Another example, I come across raiders ambushing peasants along their way to wherever. I decided to save them, so I did. But after that, there was hardly any interactions with them after the battle. No options to recruit them (forcefully), no reward haggling or even a simple flavour message from them saying ""thank you sire, you have saved my life, etc"". You could argue that I could just imagine them myself, but I want *them* to thank *me* at that moment in time. From there my immersion was starting to wear off and I was disappointed of the lack of interaction and choices with the denizens of the world.

The last example, which I was very critical about is that I can't be in fights. I can't even see myself inside the game, I have to imagine myself in the back lines directing people with my godly voice (which must've been so loud that  it can reach my subordinates regardless of distance). Imagine myself travelling with them all over the continent and imagine myself dying after my subordinates die because I'm a weak scholar that cannot carry a sword and will automatically die if not a single friendly was beside me. At first I thought it should be fine, but I found myself disinvolved in the life and death of my subordinates, only the waste of time that I spent bringing their levels up and how it was a chore to raise another character in lieu of the dead ones. I find myself just clicking on the map anticipating that some event will happen which would break this monotonous cycle of getting jobs to get money so that I can get stronger so I can do a higher paying jobs...

I was really disappointed that I can't get my own character; who should I roleplay in combat? You could argue that a model representing me inside combat doesn't matter. But I *strongly* believe in the concept that every RPG game should have a representative of the player in any situation inside the game. Especially in a game where combat is esentially the whole game. It's literally inside this game's name *Battle* brothers, If I'm not inside the battle then where would I be when it occurs? It's an oversight I cannot overlook.

After playing multiple playthroughs I find myself having the same experience on each and every one. Because in one game, I can try out different character builds on different brothers. The only difference being the end-game event, which I have to admit I haven't experienced yet. So replayability is also lacking I feel.

The combat, the core of the game, is overall very satisfying and fleshed out, with an engage/disengage system and separate head and body armor bar along with the default health bar. Hexagonal battle boards and corresponding change in sprite when a character has wounds (a lack of a nose, when it has a missing nose injury). The sound effects; very satisfying, I can feel the *OOMPH* when a hit connects. I could say these features are very effective.

Minor gripes that I have (in descending order):
-no repurchase/resell feature; when you sell or buy things accidentally, you cannot sell/buy them for the same price.
-little points of interests; besides rng hideouts and towns/fortresses, there really is nothing else (to my knowledge).
-small map; I wanted to explore more but there are only ~10 towns in the entire continent and only one exploreable continent in the whole world.
-few content(things to do) besides combat and features that supports it.
-lack of tooltips regarding details like whether a weapon is piercing or not (piercing weapons are ineffective against undead)

tl;dr

+combat
+music
+sound effects
+ambience
+character models change according to their injuries

-lack of immersion
-lack of freedom in game direction
-lack of interactivity with people on the road
-no player model
-little replayability

1-the same bar that determines how much you can move is the same that determines the amount of attacks you have,after playing Mordheim I see this sistem sucks.If you want to engage in meele,you lose all the action points that you would normally use to attack,so next turn your enemy will hit you first using all of their action points because they didnt move.

2-What is this retarded fatigue mechanic? Every time your character moves or attacks it builds fatigue,after that it can only do one attack or move per turn (but not move and attack),it takes about 6 turns to use all of your stamina,so after 6 turns your character becomes useless and can only do one action per turn.

3-It is imposible to do a hard mission without losing men,when you are in a more advanced part of the game you have 12 men and you have to figth big groups (sometimes of 15 enemies),you can beat this missions but not without losing at least 2 or 3 men,and when you men die you lose their armor and helmets forever. It is because of this that you cant save money,when you lose men you have to hire new ones,and their armor and helmets are more expensive than the money you get from doing to mission. 

 You might make money,you might not,thats the problem,the best way to make money is to only take missions that give you close to no money but that are very low risk,having permadeath of your characters in a game that forces you to lose 2 or 3 characters per mission is stupid,since you end up losing more money than what you are making in most hard missions. I cant explain how frustating it is to have your party of 12 men in a hard mission,and in the second turn have one of your men die before even getting stuck in combat because 3 archers shot all to the same men ""well,there goes my high level character and all that expensive equipment I just bought"".

 If you like games like these just play Mordheim,its just better.

P.D: Having advanced more in the game I noticed another problem,tyou max party size is 12,and sometimes in the late game you will have to face more than 12 enemies,if the enemies are low quality it doesnt matter,but figthing enemies just as strong as your in a 12vs17 scenario is imposible.

 What makes this game all of this worst is that the developers are not going to fix these problems since they wont work on this game anymore,and they wont provide mod support so other people cant fix it for them.

7,34566659,english,"Great case of how a game could be a whole lot better with just a bit more work put into it, but the developers have chosen to move on. It was in early access for most of its life, and while the gameplay was promising, it simply did not develop enough past what was offered in the early access to fully come together. As such, the game, while completely playable, feels unfinished in many ways.

One of the first factors that comes up in anyone's game is RNG. It is a very heavy componenet of the game, from the statistics of the brothers (mercenaries) you hire at each town (and which are available), to combat, and to a few other key things. When recruiting to build up your mercenary company, your first visit to a town generates the mercenary pool, as well as the items it has available. While the items are changed at times (via the in game supply caravans that roll across the map) the mercenaries available remain static after that first visit. Day 1 or Day 100, once you generate that pool, if you don't hire out all of them, that pool never changes. Massive issue here. Even once you vuy out the pool, it takes a fair bit of time for new mercenaries to regenerate. 

Another issue is combat. So, you've got a band together, they've gotten geared, and now you are going up against all the various enemy races/types. Oh, look! The enemy's two lone ranged unit, having a higher initiative, just landed three hits on a partially obscured (provides cover) target, killing them in a blink of the eye! This kind of thing happens far too often in combat, where things are going well, and then all of a sudden one character just gets piled on. To go a game without losing a mercenary involves heavy save scumming, to say the least.

Which leads into another area of issue: The Ironman difficulty. It's a concept that has been well implemented in many Strategy games such as Battle Brothers, but in this case it fails miserably. There's no real effort on the developer's end to create a balance that makes Ironman palatable to play, and even then it ends up with a heavy use of Alt+F4 so as to reload the Autosave the game makes anytime you're about to enter combat. There are just such extremes that you lose members of your band with no warning, and through zero fault of your own. Strategy is a large part of combat, but RNG plays a big chunk of it as well.

As the game progresses, it becomes the same thing over and over. There's only so many tiers of equipment and enemies of the various races that it all begins to blend together, and far more than XCOM, to use an example, ever could. I've made it to nearly Day 100 in one game, and beyond the horribly implemented Late Game Crisis, it's the same thing over and over and over, blending together rapidly. Unlike XCOM and other strategy games, there's very little sense of accomplishment after every fight after a short time.

There's also a lot of partially implemented content, or stuff that serves no purpose in the game that they seemingly never got around to. There are random events that can occur, and some have morality choices. There's a viewing of your mercenary band on your reputation page that starts you out as Neutral. It never budges. Ever. 

So, yeah. A bit more work on so many things would have make this a passable mention of a game, to a more notable, enjoyable one. Once I exhaust a bit more play from it, I'll probably drop it and never touch it again, because there just won't be a reason to.

15,34486759,english,"I find myself extremely annoyed by the recent glut of highly unfair reviews declaring this game to have been ""abandoned"" by the devs. Nothing could be more false.

The game hasn't been abandoned, it has been completed. Something that happens far too rarely with early access titles.

There is an early game, there is a mid-game, there is an end game with an appropriate high-level challenge. The game gives you the option to continue playing afterwards, and indeed there won't be anything truly new after that point... but so what? There's enough content to keep the player entertained for scores of hours at a minimum, potentially hundreds. It is entirely bug free, or at least so close to it that I am unable to find any bugs which may remain. There are probably a few left somewhere that are simply hard to notice, but I have no doubt the developers will fix those as they pop up. If there are no more frequent updates, it's because no more frequent updates are needed,

So what if it doesn't have the length and replayability of an The Elder Scrolls X: Goes on for-bloody-ever? It is an excellent game nonetheless. Of all the early access titles I've tried, Battle Brothers is by far the the one I'm most satisfied with.


There is one fair criticism that can be made: The price tag is arguably too high for what is offered. Though remarkably polished by the standards of Indie games, it is still not an AAA title, and there is no point in pretending otherwise. 

If you love turn-based tactical gameplay, you will probably find Battle Brothers to be worth the money regardless. If you have no particular preference for the genre, but are still curious, wait for it to be on sale.

The combat system is fun, but there's nothing compelling you to keep diving back into it and push forward, even if you lose.

There are also a lot of UI issues, a lot of tiny icons, a lot of little things that make both combat and character management more annoying than it needs to be; no way to compare your equipped item with one in your inventory is a good a example, trying to decide what weapon to use is a pain. The perks system is also just a giant list of a hundred tiny icons; their effects are actually interesting, but deciding what you want is just annoying; taking care of characters leveling up is similarly unsatisfying and feels like more of a chore than a happy occasion. The game expects you to micromanage a lot of things, but doesn't really provide a good UI for doing so.

I have had hundreds of hours happy gaming from BB so sincerely thank you for that. You have created a potential classic.

The decision to announce no more additions or mod support to the game is causing serious reputation damage to your Studio. Reviews on Steam have turned from Overwhelmingly Positive to Mixed as a direct result and these factors are costing you serious sales for two reasons:

Customers as less inclined to by a game that will not and cannot be expanded upon.
Negative reviews discourage customers.

It is also impacting your sales potential for next project as the customer base you have worked so hard to establish is turning hostile (Have a read about concept of Net Promoter Score NPS).

Its never too late to reverse an incorrect decision. Please could I respectfully ask that you reconsider the decision to not offer future content and Mod support? Its not too late, customers expect mistakes, it’s how companies deal with them that counts. I still believe you can win back customer support and trust.

Ignore the fact that it will not be developed much more than it already is.

If you love turn based games, I promise this will give you many 100's of hours if you love character customization and resource micro management.

Its even better on iron man mode where you feel every decision you make is life and death. 

If you love a good challenge and you believe every decision made with regards to every game mechanic should count, you cannot miss this game. 

The replayability of this game feels endless. Admittedly the perk system should still be improved, and I don't disagree there are only a number of viable builds, where there could be so much more, but even if the perk system is rigid, the replayability is still immense. 

The annonymous recruiting system is interesting where you have to try to get bad soldiers to fit into your army somehow and make the most of their senseless combination of stats.

Think Mid-Evil Fantasy meets X-Com....
Plays out similiar, game is not for the faint of heart.
Its got some seriousl difficulty to it....

But it provides hours of fun for a small price tag!

Sadly Battle Brothers is one of the lattest Steam titles to be the target of a ""Rating's Bombing""

-The claim here is that the small development team, promised mod support!

Random post was made bye a dev, over two years ago that it was something they were looking at and on the 
to do list....  

Since then Mod support has never been on the Official Road Map.  And has been stated frequently to not be feasable!
But that one steam comment long ago is now haunting a tiny Dev Team because its the focus of the current
Review Bomb campaign!

So if you want a game thats fairly cheep similiar to X-Com in a Mid-Evil Fantasy
Ignore the current ratings and do yourself a favor and get the game you won't be ""disapointed""

Tl:dr would look like this: ""the fact that the game could've been better doesn't mean that it's bad as it is"".

Battle Brothers is not a bad game by any definition. It delivers [i]exactly[/i] what it promises: tactical combat in a low-fantasy open world setting. It's not Mount & Blade, it's not a kingdom simulator, and it's not trying to be one. This game only does what it says on the store page, but it's really good at it.

The battles are fun and filled with suspense and tension, especially in the Ironman mode. You feel that every wrong move, every slight miscalculation could lead to grave consequences. Losing experienced mercs is really tough and it makes you actually care about your company. Those times when you've got to sacrifice your ""young"" guys in order to save a more valuable veteran - undescribable. 

Enemies are quite diverse and each type requires different tactics, so there's no such thing as ""best weapon"" or ""best build"". There's always challenge, even on a successful lucky run. Sure, at the later stages of the game it's possible to transform your squad into an ultimate machine of destruction, but that requires a lot of skill and dedication, and even then there are situations when it just won't be enough to beat the odds. 

There is room for roleplaying too. You could become a bandit, or a marauder, or a treasure hunter, or even go on your own crusade against the orcs, if you'd like. Every run is a story that you could write in whatever way you like. Sure, your options are somewhat limited, but it's still more than enough to get many hours of gameplay. 

I totally agree that full mod support or a few DLCs would've made this game even more engaging and interesting. But honestly, such projects are pretty rare, and if you like that kind of games - don't pass on Battle Brothers just because ""it could've been better"", it's gonna be your loss.

68,33722362,english,"This an extremely well made and excellent game, much better than it has any right to be. If you like games like Maount & Blade or XCOM this is a no-brainer pick. It's a gem. There are three things people complain about mainly:

* lack of modding support
* RNG
* Grind

The lack of modding support is an issue, it will hurt the logevity of the game (compared to Mount & Blade for example) but ultimately this a low budget indie title, the devs have the choice to continue supporting this game or making another even better one, and they've chosen to do the latter. As far as I'm concenred that's their choice and good luck to them.

The RNG in this game is pure - no quarter asked or given to either the player or the AI. As such it can be brutal. It's supposed to be. But just like XCOM the extent to which the RNG can wreck you is directly proportional to your skill and atteention to detail. It will casue you ro lose brothers occasionally but if you play well it won't cause you to lose battles or the game itself. It will merely amplify the consequences of bad decisions and losing your cool.

Finally to the question of grind. It is important to understand that this game is desinged to be played ironman. In ironman mode it is a test of skill, nerve and charcter. It is incredibly exiting and creates stories with intense highs and lows, joys and sorrows, successes and failures and also creates all sorts of different characters to colour the journeies.

But if you savescum the game loses all of that magic and becomes repetative, predictable, grindy and ultimnately pointless. You have been warned. Don't fire up this game and think you're going to win it first time out. Just play ironman and expect to last a few days and die horribly first time. Then try again and last a little longer maybe. That way you will learn to play so much better and get the real experience of Battle Brothers.

Not convinced? All you got to do is weatch a few LPs of even the best players. You will hear a constant litany of whining:

""Oh no. NOOOOOO!""
""You cannot be serious!""
""Why did I do that, Just WHY!""
""He missed again! OMG he missed again""
""OMG, they've got three marksmen. I think we've had it""
""I should have retreated. I know I should have retreated. Why didn't I retreat?""

     At the time of typing this review I am sitting at 14 hours of gameplay. So long story short I recommend this game. It’s the type of masochistic experience my 17 year old edge lord self would really enjoy. It’s a roguelike turn based strategy rpg mashup with permadeath. So if you’re the type of person that gets off by sticking glass in your genitalia like myself then this is the game for you. Also if you see a Necrosavant for the love of god just run. Even if you’re guarding a caravan it is not worth it in the early levels. They have the ability to teleport and that makes guarding the caravan near impossible as they will just teleport next to the most undefended thing on the map and get a free hit every turn.
     So I’m a big fan of this game but I’m going to start out with my criticism of this game before I get into what I like about it. First off the game world feels almost empty with a limited amount to do in it. The difficulty spikes can come out of nowhere and the only way to gauge it is by the amount you get paid per contract. It also has a terrible autosave feature. Just be sure to save after every city you come to and contract you complete because you can get fucked and be sent back days within a moment’s notice. I’ve actually accepted a caravan contract where I had to walk all the way across the map then accepted a contract out of the city I arrived at. Got near the target location and decided to camp up till morning, (all without saving). Got ambushed by Necrosavants apparently a new enemy type in the game. Having dealt with them before and having trouble with just 2 of them and now facing 9 of them I promptly hit ctrl+alt+delete shut of my computer, and moved to Brazil to teach History under the guise of a German named Hanz. 
     But other than the sharp and sometimes unforgivable difficulty I love everything else in this game. I can however understand why some people would not enjoy this game so if you actually decided to read this far in and don’t enjoy strategy rpg games then don’t buy it because you probably aren’t going to enjoy it. Also as a little side note I think the price is a little high for the quality of this game. While not as much as other games I have critiqued for the same reason it is still worth mentioning that a price $19 (£14.51) or even $25 (£19.09). Those would be more reasonable price ranges for the game but beside that it’s a great game if you’ve got a specific niche to scratch.
     So the combat system is a top down strategy game basically like chess but with auto rolls per every attack you deal. Like chess with dice I guess is the simple way to put it. It’s frustrating and painful because it puts your enemies on the same level as you. But as I have said before I love pain so that might also be the reason I enjoy this game. I can’t fully explain why I think it’s fun other than it give you just the right level of challenge without being completely stupid, in most cases at least. You basically start out with your mercenary band in ruins after being ambushed. You are tasked with bringing your band back to its former glory and then some. Basically the tasks that you are asked to do are as follows; track down thieves, defend a village, track beasts that have been killing townsfolk, defend a caravan, or go to an ancient ruin to retrieve a valuable artifact. There are several weapons and weapon classes you can go with and several strategies you can use to defeat your opponents. So this is a game you will have to use your mind to play. 
     The enemy variety is a fresh of breath are and the medieval setting is something I quite fondly enjoy. The enemies are quite varied compared to similar games but most of them are the general run of the mill Tolkien rip off with orcs, goblins and undead. But there is enough difference in between the classes to still be enjoyable. And every play through is different because you can choose a random seed that spawns a random map that you can enjoy. I usually recommend end game events at random as to keep its fresh and interesting.

I really wish I could give this an upvote, especially seeing that there is so much potential for improvement. However, the developers gave up, and Battle Brothers feels unfinished at best. Gameplay is unpolished and the content (random events etc) is sorely lacking. The game is very repetitive at this stage.

85,33568291,english,"Battle Brothers could have been a classic. Instead, it's a moderately enjoyable but ultimately forgettable experience.

The game centers around rebuilding your very own depleted mercenary company into a vaunted fighting force. You do this in the usual way, by traveling from town to town and accepting contracts. These contracts range in difficulty from easy to very hard with the harder ones usually offering more reward. You the move on the map to the site of the quest, sometimes uncovering other encounters as you go.

The meat of the game is an almost chess-like tactical battle system. You position your forces on the varied terrain and with an array of skills and classes you commence combat. It's not dissimilar to Legend of Eisenwald or The Banner Saga in this regard. Success or failure will usually (see below) result on how well you manage your troops. If your guys live they might rank up and that allows you to choose certain perks though frankly these perks are often unbalanced and therefore the illusion of choice is removed since some are so superior to others. The rewards from successfully completing a contract will be spent hiring more troops and upgrading the armor / weapons of your merry little band. As you get stronger, events happen in the world that make the dangers more difficult in this low-magic world. 

The game is well made, stable and you can tell care was put into it. The graphical style is one I don't particularly like but that's personal preference.

However....there's a few reasons why this won't be a classic. Fist of all, the RNG is a bear. In many games the RNG really isn't random or they do things to mitigate it (like Hard West's luck system). In this case you're really at the mercy of it in both your character leveling and your ""to hit"" numbers. One of the biggest complaints in games like these are that a run of bad rolls can cause you to lose. Battle Bros is probably worse in that regards because the potential consequences for just a single bad roll can be severe. When men flee in terror, or the damage can be so severe then just a couple of bad rolls can entirely overshadow your strategy. That's not good. It also extends to the randomization of getting recruits and leveling up. This is a game that rewards rubbing a rabbit's foot as much as a having a good tactical approach.

Worse, you often can't see the makeup or terrain prior to launching a battle. With terrain bonuses also being quite steep, you can accept a battle that should be winnable but simply is not because you're trying to fight while scaling the side of a mountain. It's incredible to me that the devs dropped the ball so badly on this that we're essentially thrust blindly into battles in often horrible tactical positions. 

Then there's the grind. Fight a battle. Go to town. Get another quest. Fight another battle that is slightly more difficult. Battle Bros descends into a grind that e random stories can be fun but there aren't enough enjoyable events to prevent the game from devolving into a tedious grind. This doesn't happen all at once but after some time there doesn't seem to be much purpose in it. I have no idea how this game ends because, much like this review, the grind kept going and going.

Finally, there's the issue of development and mod support. The devs released this, put out a simple patch and then moved on. I have always supported the choice of a developer to move on to another project once the last one is done. But for cryin' out loud the corpse wasn't even stiff before they exited this scene. A game like Banished gets criticism for being ""abandoned"" after release, 6 months of patches, new buildings and mod support. Battle Bros didn't do any of that. So without any new content, DLC, mod support...what you see is what you get. I find that they moved on a bit too quickly for my tastes - almost like they realized that sales didn't explode when 1.0 came out so they packed their bags and left (even though sales were constant and decent).

90,30784309,english,"After a solid 100 hours, containing about 5 unfinished runs, this game is fantastic, with a disclaimer.

What makes this game so great is the design and the replayabilty. The combat is incredibly satisfying, with plenty of stakes and risks you take as a player. Building up your squad of soldiers from simple folk with cleavers and knives, to skilled swordsman and archers with pinpoint accuracy is what this game does the best. The idea of building up your squad to the point that it can take on entire armies is great.

But this game isn't really designed to be won. This game stretches on as long as it can, with the only way to end the game proper being to retire your squad (ending the game with a written epilogue) or being wiped out in combat. There is no end goal. Unlike a game like X-COM, where there is a ticking clock and an overall objective that can be won, or Mount and Blade, where you can leave mercenary life an become a Lord, or even King, Battle Brothers is more of the same, with a steadily increasing difficulty curve.

You can find on Youtube a series of videos by a person named Lmz Frozen that demonstrates really well what the end game looks like. In those videos, he uses a fully leveled team of 12 soldiers with unique and legendary gear, and effortlessly fights hordes of 60+ enemies. It's pretty sweet to watch, but it begs the question how much effort it took to get to that point, and is that time investment really worth it?

Ultimately, I'm recommeding this game. I got a solid 100 hours of fun out of it, and unlike some people, I don't play a game for a long time that is more than my money's worth, just to say the game isn't worth it. The game is worth the price tag for sure. You can easily play this game for a long time, and experiment with the mechanics, and that is pretty fun, but it's a decision that you as a consumer have to make. Do you want a game that could theoretically keep on going, or do you want something with an end? If you want the latter, this game isn't really for you.

Also, it should be noted that this game is finished full stop. Besides bug fixes, the developers have ceased development and at this current moment it doesn't seem like they will be adding more content and features anytime soon. This was a dealbreaker for a lot of people who were anticipating extra features to be added, which is why the current average rating is at 'Mixed'.

In this game you lead a band of mercenaries in a randomly generated map through adventures where, after slowly building your team, you face off against an epic randomly generated end-of-world type event.   

Pros:

Amazing tactical gameplay with no overwhelming “meta” needed to beat the game; there are many different team builds that are all genuinely viable. 

Combat is a wonderful medieval bloody mess.

Fun RPG choices for your group based on their background: My disgraced drunken noble lost his great sword so I had him flogged. Turns out he got a little mad about this and left my band.  Good riddance to Sigmaur I say!  My ex-Monk talked some children out of joining a crusade where they would almost certainly would have died: good work Torkel!

The random generation of events and missions builds in a ton a replay value. 

Cons:

Most of the cons in this game are about presentation more than anything else.  Simply put the game is not flashy:

Graphics are not anything to write home about 

To get story immersion you *gasp* have to read text instead being presented with voice acting.

I don't like the turn of the reputation that this game takes.
It's not as if the game had been a disaster or full of bugs, or if the gameplay displeased strongly. There is a long and beautiful work, in terms of gameplay, writing, graphics and sound. Developers get lynched for a so-called abandon of project while they have worked on it for 4 or 5 years to lay an artistic jewel.
I understand that we can be a little disappointed. I, too, would have liked them to improve it, add weapons, etc ... But to say that they stole your money, you are mad! Stop believing that developers are at your service, dedicated to making the game evolve again for 10 years. The video game is like all the arts, if the creators, without the pressure of the creditors, because there are independent, decide that it's complete and that it represents what they wanted to transmit, then it's finished.
About modding, why would they be forced to add it? If they don't want to change their game and leave it like that because they want us to see it that way, why ? When you read a book or watch a movie, what would be the point of changing the view of an author by replacing the description or the face of an actor by another?

I was saddened when I heard that they will no longer be supporting this game. But I am overjoyed that they made it in the first place. 
As far as the game itself is concerned, it is an RNG heavy TBS in a very gritty low magic medieval world (reminds me of Warhammer, just without the magic). You move around on the main map (which is somewhat lacking in content, and this is the main gripe most people have), get contracts in towns and villages, and fight on hex based battle map. The art style seems very basic (there are no animations, hell, there are no legs), but it is stunningly beautiful (in a gritty way) and incredibly detailed. The battles are heavily reliant on RNG, but there is a lot of room for tactics both in combat (postioning, skill use) and before (equipment, leveling stats and getting traits), that most of the time you will feel that the RNG is tough but fair. Of course, there will be frustration, and a lot of it, so don't buy this if you dislike the outcome being random (although again, you can stack the deck in your favor with careful application of tactics).
All in all, this is my favourite buy this year, and I don't regret a cent.

7,31012435,english,"EDIT: Changed my review to negative, due to it seems that devs concluded on working on the game. No DLCs, no mod support and whatnot. Therefore gameplay problems won't be fixed, it seems.

I wish there would be a ""not yet"" or ""neutral"" option for rating the game. Anyway, it is definitely crafted with love and care and I sincerely believe this game will be a great one, yet, I cannot recommend it wholeheartidly. Strong points are covered by other reviewers, so I will focus on what I feel missing. TL;DR -> It can be fixed with a hefty DLC or expansion pack.

My main grief is that the game feels grindy in it's current state. Basically you are moving between towns/settlements and take contracts. These contracts have a nicely written prelude, but after a few hours you realize that those are just more of the same. There is a limited variation of quests and although the devs try to rotate them (including some of the lore text), it just becomes a grind.

Which would not be a problem if the sandbox world would offer plenty of things to do. But it does not. You can raid some locations, but their number is scarce and apart of that, there is not much to do here. Variation of enemies is limited, there are a few stacks of opponents in increasing difficulty and you will fight them during most of your time. After a few hours, when you can take on more difficult tasks, you get one or two different stacks of enemies and it goes on.

Anyway, I have faith in the game and if a DLC brings more quests, opponents and potentially other options to enjoy the game apart of doing errands, I will be a happy camper.

11,33360711,english,"It pains me to do this but I'm unfortunately going to have to give this a thumbs down. I originally bought the game 3 or 4 years ago while it was in EA. It came up on my list of something I might play so I said whatever. I understand EA titles. I played the game for a bit in EA then watched it develop. But the thing is, it really did not develop. There is no ""end game."" I had thought I might be able to make my own kingdom or there wold be some resolute ending, but there isn't. It's so cliche to say the word ""repititve"" but yeah. I played Black Desert Online since release (before steam) so I am familair with RNG, but every single one of the enemy's archers hits mine however my archers can never seem to hit them. The weight feels so heavy towards AI that there is honestly no point in even hiring archers, which leaves combat to 1 person trying to kill 3 or 4 end game units, which is what end game is. Basically the 'surround and attack' strategy is the only feasible strategy in the game. 

The game is also difficult even if you're palying on easy. You do not want to attempt to play on the hardest difficulty and if you select the function where you cannot save the game you will have a miserable time. Generally the terrain is in your disadvantage and tedious to climb around, while the AI rains all of their arrows on you and finishes you off with melee as soon as you approach. Even with shields and evasive/defensive perks the arrows still seem to hit (wow amazing!). The rain and darkness also hinder your own ability to use ranged attacks however the AI are so properly trained that it doesn't seem to affect them for the most part. 

I really wanted to like this game and when I bought it there was a lot of potential. Reading the statement though: 'we're dropping this game to make another game and hey look next time the character models will have arms and legs that move! Be excited for us!' really seemed to leave a bad itch under my skin. Imo, the game is not finished and not nearly worth $30.

12,33358507,english,"tl;dr it's good for the reasons Mount and Blade are good (eg; its parts are all mediocre, but somehow it's addictive), but its RNG is fucking atrocious and it doesn't have modding support planned. 

long; Battle Brothers is a tactical RPG that's a bit like Darkest Dungeon meets Mount and Blade with a bit of a stress-based heart attack mixed in there. The game's music is fucking fantastic, the aesthetic - while I started iffy about it - grew on me, and while its mechanics are janky, unpolished, and collapsing under their own weight, much like the state of my heart after playing it and raging countless times, it has the same sort of roughshod charm that Mount and Blade does. Your role is to lead a mercenary company to glory and money in a world catching fire; build up from your motley crew of 3 up to as many as 20 men, controlling up to 12 at a time. You kit them out, take contracts, explore the world, kill orcs, fight noble houses, level your soldiers, and all in all, do what you can to get paid and not die, a lot like I am when the cardiac arrest kicks in. 

The game's parts (not including the music) are all mediocre to some degree or another, but somehow, someway, they all form into a game that I could not stop playing after I picked it up. You can tell it was made with love, and considering how much of the game is randomly generated - from quests, to names, flags, maps, characters, fights, much like my erratic heartrate - that's an impressive feat. It wears its heart on its sleeve. ""It's gonna get rough,"" it seems to warn you in the tutorial that you need to go out of your way to find, ""and you're gonna get fucked up.""

You might, at this point, be asking yourself two questions: Jackety, do you need to see a cardiologist? After playing this, yes, yes I do. The other question might be ""well, what the fuck's the problem? That sounds like any other TRPG.""

Sadly, it's not. RNG is always a plague, but in most games, it's possible to get past it. You find ways to get around it. You learn how to pump numbers up so high that the randomness is mitigated, or you master other mechanics that make it possible to get out ahead. You're rewarded for learning the mechanics. Or, as you get better and better gear, some things are made easier, while others remain harder. 

So what the fuck's the problem, right? My impending heart attack. Other than that: the RNG. It's not just that the random number generator in this game - on any difficulty beyond Easy - feels weighted to the AI; it's that there is so fucking much of it. Each character has ten stats. (Each stating stat is randomized.) Each level, a character can upgrade three stats; you pick three stats, and the amount they go up is ... also a dice roll. A character has preference to higher rolls on a few different stats - each is different - but with a few exceptions, you can say ""there's a dice roll"" to just about fucking everything in the game. There's too much randomness, and it's too easy for five or six rolls to happen over the course of two actions that causes everything to sink to shit, a lot like my heart at the moment. 

If you've got the mind for this sort of pain and suffering - straight up hard-ass no-mercy tactical RPG slaughter - then go for it. The game won't treat you fairly. It'll make you cheese bullshit to survive for the first ten or so hours until you get some real gear, and even then, it'll ruin your day. 

Even so, without mod support, it's just a pile of untapped potential that could be on the level of Mount and Blade in terms of time taken - but on top of the RNG (bad enough as it is), the game lacks so much polish in so many different ways, lacks so many basic quality-of-life things within its own framing, and has such a partial UI that shit just rolls down hill.

ps important context: the devs have stated their intent not to work on the game any longer. I probably would not have written this review if they hadn't; I'd be patiently waiting for mod support to come out. Know this: I cut my teeth on XCOM's Long War. I got mad. I stopped playing. I continued playing. But not once, not a single goddamn time, was I ever angry enough to outright uninstall the game. 

So, short version again; game could be great, but there's too much bullshit, and it's no longer an active project. Don't buy unless it's on a 60% sale or something. (Never seen it on sale for more than 25% off), and be ready to be viciously, unproductively fucking angry.",1499473391,1499473391,False,14,1,0.458701819181442261,2,True,False,False,76561198015285377,229,2,13286,0,2103,1573865374,,

At a glance, which is the most, the vast majority of people will see, the developers seemed to have every intention to continue to develop the game as is common with indie titles. They took a 3 month break with almost zero communication shortly after release and came back to announce they are 100% finished with the game beyond patching bugs and small QoL features.

So yes, it has been abandoned if you consider no additional content is coming, in a game that although is generally good (and in my opinion had the potential to be a classic like XCOM), is sorely lacking in content and in fact plays like a beta. As it is still missing key features such as battle map generation, this is not a minor feature nor are camp followers and dungeon locations.

To put into the context of food service, if you had purchased a very delicious burger and had seen a picture of it on the menu, but had only recieved a partial burger, no matter how delicious it ended up being, most people will still feel a little bit cheated. Many would even offer to pay additional money in order to get the full burger because it was so good and this is what I believe to be the situation with BB. The burger was actually so good that the customers are begging to be able to go behind the counter into the kitchen and make their own burger (modding).

Don't get me wrong, I definitely got my money's worth in playtime and it was generally fun as I was not turned off by how repetitive the game is. However not everyone likes playing the same dozen of missions that all play fairly similiarly to each other. Nor does everyone think its acceptable for every single battle to take place in randomly generated wilderness, unless near a road in which case one is present on the map. What are supposed to be the 2 most difficult battles in the game, the Monolith and the Goblin city are both identical to any other battle, except for the part you fight approximately 50 enemies at the same time instead of the usual 20 or so. No cool goblin city assets, or towering obelisk as it is displayed on the campaign map, just randomized wilderness. I mean seriously, for a fight like an orc warlord's camp, which is described to be a sea of tents, how hard can it be include tents in the tileset? The only signs of civilization are broken carts alongside roads in the battle map, so clearly the basic system has been implemented, there just isn't any art to go along with it.

In conclusion, the game is fun and well made but it is unfinished and the developers have no intention to continue working on it nor have they shown any interest in allowing to modders to do it for them.

I've played for 17.5 hours, and I've already had my £17.50 sale price worth, and I'm utterly hooked right now. How people with approaching 100 hours can criticize the experience is frankly beyond me. Were they forced to keep playing by some transdimensional dungeon master, as penance for fantastical crimes? Or did they suddenly wake one night, screaming 'it's all just collecting rusty weapons and bits of old armour!' at the ceiling. Perhaps we will never know. Or at least I hope I won't.

Don't be put off by the cartoony heads-only graphics either. I swear those little guys have more character in them the most detailed of highly-rendered 3D models. Artistic talent combined with imagination is a crazy thing. 

What I love about this game, what gives it it's almost unique feel as an RPG, is the struggle to just keep your crew going. It's somewhere between a rogue-alike and nostalgic RPG's, in a place I'm not quite sure I've been before - somewhere between believing I'm progressing confidently and yet at no point being confident of progressing. Now *that's* exciting, and something so few RPG's capture, especially nowadays when the AI delivering a player a crushing failure is seen as a somehow taboo user experience.

The balance of manpower v gear is terrific. How many RPG's have you played where the shops were full of cheap tat that you never even looked at, because your level 2 weapons already surpassed them all? Not here! Oh no, here you are glad starting out if you can just find enough forks, straw hats, knives and shirts to cover everyone's backs. Stuff costs money, loot is scarce, and the economy of second hand goods is a b*tch. Forget about those shiny big swords for now, people gotta eat. It's awesome. 

And why do you care about tat gear? Because again, starting out, throwing an untrained baker at the enemy naked is pointless, but give him an axe and a leather shirt and he's a valuable tool of meat and metal whirling at an outnumbered enemy. He'll probably die, sure. But so long as you get that axe back, it'll be worth it. Hopefully you'll make enough in the next contract to buy enough food for another week and still keep paying the men.

Just don't get too attached to anyone - life is cheap in this game. But wages and food are expensive, so there's always the consolation that if your men die, they won't be asking for either. :)

This game has almost a roguelike element (especially played ironman) in that it doesn't hold your hand; there are plenty of ways to get your troop killed off quickly if you're not cautious - don't expect an easy time! But if you're willing to learn the mechanics and can handle the occasional frustration (and, perhaps more importantly, know when to run away!) it's an enjoyable game.

Note: Please disregard the recent rash of negative reviews about 'unfinished' or 'lacking content'. There are some in the fanbase who are angry with the devs and trying to gain revenge by posting unfair reviews - the game is complete, polished, and finished. The disagreement is simple; the community would have liked to see DLC and modding the devs elected not to include it. But the game as stands is a complete finished product and well worth the price if you like games of this style.",1499083585,1499083585,True,4,0,0.518741369247436523,0,True,False,False,76561198008681694,290,4,30066,0,16567,1548908321,,
34,27578170,english,"Early access & Supporter edition buyer here with 200+ hours in EA. My 2 cents:

Pros -

- Diverse range of enemy types and tactics needed to fight them
	- Humans (Bandits,Mercernaries,Noble Houses)
	- Greenskins (Goblins,Orcs)
	- Undead (Ancient Dead, err Zombies?)
	- Beasts (Direwolves, Ghouls)

- Awesome battle music. The Noble Houses theme captures the mood of an army going to war while the Orc theme gives me the feeling that my brothers are going to get their asses kicked.

- Brutal & unforgiving combat with emphasis on unit positioning. Common deaths for a newbie merc:
	- Flanked by 3 enemies
	- Standing in the open without a kite shield when fighting Humans or Goblins
	- Not equipping a kite shield when fighting Humans or Goblins
	- Not having the high ground
	- Going in unprepared against Swordmasters, Hedge Knights, Orc Warriors or Necrosavants

- Huge amount of customization (around 10 weapons & 40 perks to choose from)


Cons -

- Battle map generation can be unfair sometimes. Your brothers can start the battle standing in the swamp (negative stats penalty) while the enemy is on dry land or starting at the base of the hill while 5++ enemy marksmen are on top of the hill. GG.

- No game mechanic to recover from loss of veteran brother (lvl 9++). For example XCom2 has this option where you can hire a top level soldier for a reasonable cost. Battle Brothers here only gives you a Training Hall option with bonus to EXP gained by the replacement brother.

Replacing one is very time consuming. One battle gives about 200 EXP and it takes about 11k EXP to hit lvl 9++.

- No indoor enviroment / building tiles during battle. The battle terrain is mainly plains,forest,swamp,snow with some hills. You wont see castle/building tiles when fighting in the Noble Houses barracks or dungeon tiles when attacking an Undead Fortress. It can be immersion breaking when the pre battle text says you are assaulting an Orc Warlord camp and when the battle map loads, all you see is plains.

- Unique equipments are sometimes poorly balanced. Some uniques stats can be worse than normal equipment stats or worthless. E.g Unique weapon with bonus to durability only or unique armor with slightly better armor (about +10?) 

- No mod support. Devs mentioned that the last update is the final feature update. If you just want 1 playthrough, the game is good enough as it is. But if you want to play multiple campaigns, you will notice the rough edges, missing features, potentials that can be fixed with mod support. Battle Brothers can be a cult classic, but without mod support it will only be a good game with unrealized potential/what-could-have-beens.

TL:DR, buy the game if you are just going to play through the campaign once; wait for sale/major discounts if you plan to replay it alot of times.",1480123150,1499079392,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197993735636,202,7,34033,0,16623,1600532417,,
35,33161472,english,"There's been a slew of negative reviews about this game over the last couple of weeks. I'm adding a countervailing point because these people have misplaced sentiments of ownership. Purchasing this game does not confer ownership over its creative direction. The developers are satisfied the game in its current state reflects their initial vision of Battle Brothers. It does. This game is feature complete, and a wickedly addictive and entertaining final product.

This game does have unrealised potential. All games inherently do because no game is perfect. Does that mean that this game is fundamentally bad or not worthy of praise? No it does not. Battle Brothers stands comfortably beside the other acclaimed giants of its genre. All from a small independent studio.

Developers should not be punished for following their own creative visions. They should be applauded. Overhype Studios have consistently shown they have the stones to make hard decisions, regardless of the braying of a vocal minority. That is the mark of a studio unafraid to take risk and prepared to stand by their decision making. For that, these guys get my seal of approval. You guys rock.

And so does Battle Brothers.",1499044278,1499044278,True,6,0,0.483790963888168335,0,True,False,False,76561198036316719,133,11,45597,0,12933,1598616182,,
36,33158869,english,"Battle Brothers is a tempting game - it has a lot to like. To date, I've played over 200 hours and I enjoy many aspects of the game.

1. Weapons are cool - it really matters what your soldiers are armed with
2. Grid map - the grid map allows for interesting manuevers
3. World map - the world map randomly generates and creates new environments.

But the game is plagued by an underlying meanness - not only is failure very difficult to recover from, the game almost delights in killing your men and keeping you on the edge. If you run from a battle, your men suffer injuries that can be very serious. However you can run from a combat by manuevering your soldiers to the edge of the map in a very specific way - unfortunately you won't earn any experience - and any casualties you suffer are just salt in a wound. 

What is almost the worst part is gear. If you loose a man there is a chance that all his gear is lost. If you kill an opponent by smashing through their armor, their armor is destroyed and you get nothing for it. There appears to be a percent chance to get their weapons - so that zombie with a greatsword that killed two of your men, there is a good chance that you won't get the greatsword.

Certain types of professions are supposed to create items - I haven't seen any evidence of this in my play.

The game could bump your soldiers abilities by 10-15% and still be just as challenging.

I give it 3/5",1499039116,1499039116,False,3,0,0.434797495603561401,1,True,False,False,76561198164792941,29,1,18942,0,14191,1518750590,,
37,33156657,english,"A truly great game. Every game is subjective, but what this game set out to be, it acomplishes. Not only does it do turn based tactics superbly, it also leaves you wanting more.

This is a game for people who enjoy the mechanics of games. The turn based gameplay is heavily focused on odds that rewards sound tactical plays, and formations, but also punishes weak plays in a way that can seem unfair sometimes. When this game suck you in, it will drag you down with its tough starts, and easily killed party members. Which sets you up for a genuine challenge of getting better as a player. The actual progress in Battle Brothers is not only upgrading your crew, but learning to stack odds, identify low risk situations in and out of battles, and managing funds. 

You could classify this game as a sandboxy/rogue-likey game, with its over world that lets you choose what you want to do at anypoint, and the many restarts of losing countless men to bad decisions.

There are some faults that come with the game, one example, a certain opacity to contracts that you are given, but can be forgiven with its tight gameplay, and rewarding success. Other issues may include unfair deaths, or perks that you feel are manditory for success (this is highly controversial). This will lead you to the active community with many solutions or enlightenment on whatever hurdle you are encountering.


At around 200 hours, i feel a personal completion to the game, with my creative mind going nuts over the possiblity of using this game as a platform, or even fantasied DLC content. Battle Brothers will leave you a feeling of wanting more from this addicting ride. Due to its now finished state, this can leave you disheartened, as this inspiring game will make you think of countless, amazing things, that could be added to it.


This game has a time limit, you may have personal issues with certain aspects, either in game, or of the development itself. But the core gameplay is so solid, the platform very inspiring, and the challenges so real, that the ticket price is much worth the experience of a truly great game.

It's a challenging strategy game which is a mix of running a mercenary business (salvaging stuff from people/goblins/orcs/zombies/and a few types of beasts that you kill, buying stuff at towns that you need, selling stuff at the towns, hiring people based upon their background and a vague description), and the battles are the part that is tactical and turn-based on a hexagonal map that has a feel like a board game but with satisfying screams, puffs of blood, and the clash of metal.

There is a huge variety of loot, a good mix of balanced weapon types, and it's just really well done. The variety of enemy types is enough, but not spectacular. Each faction has some interesting quirks and strengths.

I think some people think the battles get monotonous. I haven't experienced that, but if you're somebody with a short attention span who needs a lot of variety within a single game (like gwent in witcher 3 to take a break from swinging your sword, I suppose), then you might not like this game.

The recent influx of red thumbs calling out Overhype for greed is nothing short of herd mentality stupidity.
All these reviews mention promises made and broken, these promises never happened. The most they did was to say ""we'll try our best but it's unlikely"".

These guys have been hard at work non-stop for 2 years straight. Every. Single. Day.
Constant updates and dev blogs.
On demand bug fixes.
Very opened to balance suggestions and concerns, even if sometimes of course they simply disagreed.
Massive content and features addition, some of these directly born from players' desires.

Battle Brothers is finished.
It's very easy to have ideas about all the features that could be added, but that applies to any game. It doesn't stop the fact that 

Battle Brothers'
Developement
Is
Finished

It's not greed, you typical red thumb bot video game mold, it's a finished and polished product with extremely high playtime and challenge value, a creation of passion, sweat, and hard work.
Hundreds of us have spent hundreds of hours out of this gem.
We've debated strategy and metagame for pages and pages on the forums, and there's still a lot to go.

The music is briliant
The gameplay is briliant
The designs are briliant

Battle Brothers is demanding, hard, but fair and engorging.
Don't you dare call out these guys under the flag of corporate greed, you literally have no idea what you're talking about.
No.

Update after 1 month of play - 

already played more than 200 hours - I do play offline. for some reason my steam games always crush in online mode (all the games).
this game is still as awesome as it was a month ago!
the game is very challenging and very strategic.
the game intended to be played as iron man and veteran - so I recommend to start in that level.
The more that I play this game the more that I learn how to use all the tactics, perks and weapons that the game has to offer. it is still adductive as it was a month ago and I still can't wait to get home and play it. 
the reason that I recommend ironman is because this is the best way to emphasize the tactical side of the player. you really need to get better with your tactics when you play ironmen if you want to survive this brutal game. and this is really one of the things that got me keep going. I think you can't get this feeling when you are not playing ironman, knowing that you can just load, just ruining this all experience and doesn't encourage you to get better .",1496301366,1498465751,True,172,4,0.809551537036895752,5,True,False,False,76561198072249443,42,4,23993,0,380,1588152206,,

83,32684960,english,"There's a lot to love about this game. It's gritty, brutal and very, very challenging. As of this moment, my list of casualties number well above 100. You'll have to keep your eyes peeled for promising new recruits at all times, as you will lose men, lots of them. You'd do wise in trying your best to keep at least 2 or 3 men alive as a core in your mercenary outfit, and build your Mercenary outfit around them. As I'd always do, I recommend playing on the hardest difficulty for the best experience, though not necessarily on Ironman Mode - Choose for yourself. 

The weaponry and armours are very accurate to real world medieval history. You'll find no fancy-pancy flaming swords or ridiculously oversized weapons/armour in this game, as you unfortunately do in so many other games, which always makes me *facepalm*. So I commend the developers for taking me seriously enough to make serious equipment that I can actually take seriously. 

The maps genereated for each playthrough are different from another, so your adventure will be different than that of another player, at least geographically speaking, which is nice. 

The fact that the game is so brutal and you'll lose so many men makes you care about your men, and you will strive to keep them alive. It will feel wortwhile, and it will feel like you have everything to lose. When you succeed, it will feel very rewarding. You can be on a high with a nearly full complement of Mercs (20 men), only to take a contract to hunt down a foe whose strength and numbers are unknown to you, and you'll lose half of your men in a single fight, even if you win. And remember, High ground is your best friend, always. You'll also have to arm and equip all of your men at all times to make sure they are ready for fights to come.

There will be 15-20 towns, all of which frequently offer contracts as you travel through them, and there will be several Noble Houses involved, usually offering more difficult contracts for higher pay. At times, well into the game, you'll find yourself in the middle of war and invasions. Quite simply, there's a lot to like.

The downside, in my opinion, is that story-wise the game is lacking. You might be able to compensate for it by using your imagination and telling your own story within the game, but there could have been stronger emphasis on story, and to give you a sense of purpose beyond simply earning coin and earning a fame.

Still, I very much recommend the game. it's very enjoyable. Don't miss out.

The pacing of the game is good too - you start small and slowly work up to getting a band of grizzled veterans clad in steel, and then a crisis starts, shit hits the fan, world goes to hell. But even when you get there, you can occasionally have some fun wiping floor with low-level bandits. 
Oh, and difficulty levels - there is no x-comy shit like ""on expert enemies get +chance to hit so that full cover is null"". It increases the amount of enemies and the quality of their equip, and worsens your starting conditions - but no cheating for the ai. And AI is pretty decent too. 
The graphics are beatiful and detailed, I especially liked mercenaries' faces - they look exactly as you'd expect landsknechts to look. 
The music is pretty cool, I even listen to OST outside the game. 
The release is polished, I've encountered no bugs even at ""final update"" beta state. 

TLDR: buy it. Right now, without considerations. It's that good.

Seeing an influx of negative reviews after the dev's decision to stop the the development, here's a small update:

AFAIK, the devs didn't promise any new post-release content. The've actually stated many times in their diaries that they have some ""end"" state for the game in mind.They didn't make any promises to continue supporting the game with free content or paid DLCs - only to consider it.

They've released from EA in decent state with only a few patches required. All of their EA goals were reached, all promises fulfilled. The game was perfectly playable then and is perfectly playable now. They've released  a  free content update.

As for gameplay and tediousness, I've played for 25 hours and it felt good. Then I've put it on pause for the content update to arrive. Now I will continue playing it and, I guess, will go for another 25h at least. $20 for a 50h game is a good deal.

Both men are badly injured, their armor in tatters, their shields broken.  They pause for long minutes to regain their strength, too exhausted and shaken even to taunt. The bandit stands at bay on his little knoll, too smart or frightened to come for Ulrich, and for a moment it seems that Ulrich will simply limp away, turn his back on death for the moment.  But this is not his way, and with grim face he pushes across the gully for the final clash.  With a powerful shield-bash Ulrich sends the bandit sliding down the opposite side of the hill and he gains the height himself, prepared to deliver the killing blow.  

The bandit, on low ground and moments from death, swings desperately once, twice.  The second strike kills Ulrich. [/i]

Battle Brothers is about moments like this.  It's the best turn-based combat game I've ever played.  Better than Darkest Dungeon, better than XCOM.  

You'll see some sour grapes in the negative reviews about how the developer ""abandoned"" the game after release, how the game could have been so much more.

97,32593747,english," Battle Brothers is a game about a mercenary company. This is a tactical fighting game so you will do that a lot - fighting. Sure there are very well written flavour texts before and after each quest and there are random events (depending on your mercs' traits) but the main thing that you will do in this game is fighting enemies.
  Also you will manage your merc company (buy them better armor and weapon, distribute skill points, choose perks, feed them) and do some trading.
 There are a randomly generated main map with cities and quest places. You will get your quests and buy equipment in the cities and do your duties in the rural areas and wildernesses (swamps, forests, mountains, snowy plains).
 In fight you will see the tactical, hexagon-based map and the fighters are represented with busts - somewhat akin to pawns in fantasy chess sets. The armor deterioration and injuries are visible on the units during the combat. Different weapons and perks gave you many interesting choice in a fight so you will not get bored (that is if you like tactical combat games).  After a fight you get some loot and XP.
 The setting of the game is a low-magic fantasy world so there will be no fireballs, but there are supernatural enemies - for example undeads.

7,32569628,english,"With 100+ hours in this game I feel fairly obligated to write a review. I showed up late to the party and discovered this gem when it was officially released, unlike so many others among the community who supported the game's development while it was still in early access. That being said I am not as emotionally attached to the title because I have only seen the end state, and I felt no sadness when the developers announced that they would be moving on to create something different. I am just going to give my unbaised review, what I have enjoyed and what I haven't, etc etc.

What I enjoyed the most out of Battle Brothers is what the title is at it's core, a challenging and rewarding turned based tactical game. There is something so fun about recruiting a group of vagabonds, each man with his own background and story, and then throwing them into a battle that you can actually lose. There isn't a restart button, if one of your men dies then he's gone, out of the game for good. You have to actually consider risk vs. reward and understand that you will indeed lose people. There's no shame in playing this game at it's novice and veteran difficulties, because there is always a challenge present and only the most hardcore (and masochistic, haha) gamers could play at it's most difficult level.

 I love going from town to town and completing missions and the such. Everything is streamlined and there isn't a lot of micromanaging which I enjoy. You have to buy provisions and tools in order to keep your company going but it isn't overly complicated and I actually like this feature because it makes your company feel like it's a living, breathing entity. Missions are usually pretty basic (kill this group of people, kill that group of monsters, etc) but there's enough variety to keep you going, and the end game crises can be pretty fun. Going up against a noble house is my favorite because the battles can get pretty big (and dangerous!) and the pay is ridiculously high. 

I could write for hours about the actual combat in Battle Brothers so i'm going to keep it brief. It's a tactical game and you have think tactically as a result; rushing into battle is going to get everyone killed the vast majority of the time. There's a ton of depth when it comes to combat but learning how to play isn't all that difficult. Think about it like chess, you can learn the rules and how all the pieces move within 20-30 minutes but people spend their entire lives trying to achieve mastery of the game. Battle Brothers is very similar, with every player having their own style of play that evolves over time and experience.

What I don't like is the lack of content. Enemy variety is limited and much of the game world feels the same regardless of where you're at on the map. I understand that this title was developed by a small indie studio but I would have liked to experienced more out of it. Maybe one day they'll make a Battle Brothers 2 and it'll have everything I ever wanted, but until then I'll have fun with what I was given. 

Overall I think Battle Brothers is just really fun to play and I see myself playing it regularly for a long time to come. I love turn based strategy games to begin with and I have to say this title has given me much more than I bargained for. If this game seems interesting at all to you I highly recommend it because I've definitely gotten my monies worth.

Battle Brothers is not a bad game. In fact, this will be more of a mixed review with the intent to help others who have not already purchased the game. I purchased the game during Early Access based on many of the reviews at the time.

First of all, congratulations to Overhype Studios for creating a polished, detailed and, from what I can tell, bug-free game.   I am excited to see what else they will do!

Battle Brothers - A Turn Based Tactical RPG:

Yes, the combat is turn-based. I prefer this style of turn-based combat when compared to games like The Banner Saga, for example. Here each combat participant, ally and enemy, is given a turn with the order based on their initiative. Resolve and fatigue also play a role? You can defer all or part of your action points until later in the combat round, if you choose. This is extremely well done and opens up a lot of nice strategy options. In The Banner Saga, the turn order always staggered the allies and enemies. This meant if you were down to one enemy, it would get a turn between each of your allies, until it was dead. Battle Brothers combat is much more elegant.

RPG? The RPG elements are the weakest part of this game. There is some background flavour text you can read when you hire your mercs. Events may occur based on backgrounds and traits so it matters who is in your party. Your choices in these events may have consequences, some good, some very bad. There are also random events that occur throughout your travels. It is open world, so areas of interest will also appear on the map. You can select perks when you level. You can also increase your stats. As far as RPG, these perks are for combat pursposes only. There are no classes in the traditional RPG sense. Your mercs are either ranged, melee, or both. It would be a nice touch to hire a blacksmith or healer (non-combatants) for your group. I tried hiring mercs with traits like greedy, tiny, superstitious, etc., in hopes it might add more to the game... Quests are contracts. You can have only one a time. By completing or failing contracts, you develop reputation with the towns and noble houses. The game grinds. Even a lot of positive reviews will tell you that. The map can feel mostly empty for a sandbox. Since Early Access, the game has added ambitions and end-game scenarios. I was hoping those might improve story and gameplay more. The game is called Battle Brothers for a reason...

Combat. Here the game should shine. It can and does, most of the time. As there are so many positive reviews, this one will try to cover some of the negative combat aspects. This is not a dungeon crawl game. Combat happens outside, always. This is surprising considering a lot of locations are forts and towers. Your party usually starts on the left, unless you intervene in combat already started. The variety is the terrain. You can have swamp, tundra, forest, hills, etc. The terrain can add definite strategy. It can also be very clunky. There are obstacles like logs, and shrubbery (""Ni!""). All you can do is move around them, and that can take a lot of turns and fatigue build up. They will easily create bottlenecks based on AI zones of control, which really only succeed in prolonging combat. This is not a stealth game. Backstabbing perk adds bonuses based on how many other allies surround the enemy. I tried to create a traditional rogue type but did not succeed. Despite being directly behind an occupied (and stunned) opponent, I consistently hit the shield! The AI is very good (Veteran). If you are squishy, you will be targeted. So, you adapt. Ultimately, combat started to feel the same and grind as well. Sure traits, perks and equipment will improve your chances, but they had a minimal effect on the overall tactics. I wish there were an option to allow the enemy to surrender. In my last fight, I outnumbered my two near-death opponents 6:1. The next round I could not deliver the killing blow so I watched as a raider crit-hit dead two of my well-equipped yet fatigued mercs. RNG. Many do love the game for this reason. I just saw it as a waste of my time. Time I would rather spend doing something else.

It may have been finished before realizing its full potential, but what we ended up with wasn't bad. 

So what is it about? You basically get to manage a mercenary company. The actual combat is turnbased with fancy mechanics such as fatigue and action points. Action points are akin to other games with similar turnbased fighting (X-com, for example) but your men, and the enemies (with exception for the undead) are hampered by fatigue aswell. Weapons have niches and armor has drawbacks but works as a secondary health pool of sorts. 

The management part is pretty neat too but more bareback. You move your company around on the world map, taking on contracts, managing logistics in terms of medicin, tools and food. You also manage the men while on the world map, primarily who fights and who dosen't, who can level up and how should they level up. What equipment shall they use? And so forth.

The world map is random at each playthrough, events happens while you wander about being badass.

I'd say that the game can be revisited whenever you feel like it, even though it is completed now. Each and every playthrough will be different from the next. Primarily in the men you end up with and the layout of the world. That can make an enormous difference.

There is no campaign since the story is just about you starting a mercenary company!

The game however can be a little lacking in the replay department due to the fact that you're sorta forced to be a...I wouldn't say good guy but more of like a Lawful neutral group of guys. Some times you'll get the option to do some fucked up shit, but most of the time you're more of like an alright group of dudes.

You can't really roleplay as a sorta strict group of decked out bandits or brigands who're organized enough to take on larger foes. Instead you're forced to help out nobility and smaller towns to gain money rather then pillage and loot like how you can in Mount and Blade Warband.

52,30367759,english,"Mount and Blade mixed with XCOM is the easiest way to describe this, but Battle Brothers is so much more.

At it's core, this is a tactical strategy game. Players control up to 12 units in battle and will fight a myriad of enemies from nobles to orcs to undead, all with their own strengths and weaknesses. More importantly, every hostile army feels truly unique. Orcs aggressively ram your troops while trying to overpower you. Human parties will defend their elite marksmen, forcing you to flee or go on the attack. Ancient undead legions use their shields to play a game that forces you to win before your men become too exhausted to fight. There is no one size fits all tactic in Battle Brothers, and that's honestly pretty rare.

The RPG element comes from leveling up your mercenary brothers, hiring new ones, completing quests for towns and nobles, exploring the procedurally generated map, and buying/finding new equipment. There's a lot of immersion to be had from quests that generate based on nobles' personalities and local threats. Well written events happen every so often to slowly flesh out your characters. Eventually, an endgame scenario arises that will challenge the player. Afterward, it can be played more like a neverending sandbox or the player can start again in a brand new world. 

It is still in Early Access so it's not perfect yet. The pros and cons are as of today's patch.

Pros:
+ Thoughtful and varied tactical strategy
+ Procedurally generated worlds feel unique yet familiar
+ Tons of backgrounds, traits, and events to provide emergent gameplay opportunities
+ Permadeath will keep you on your toes
+ Large roster of potential brothers (12 active, 8 reserve) to create unique compositions and ease the pain of permadeath
+ Challenging difficulties (Veteran, Expert) for those who want it and Beginner difficulty for those who don't
+ Excellent pacing leading up to the endgame crises
+ Developers are on the ball with updates
+ Combat feels accurately representative of medieval warfare without being too nuanced

Cons:
- Events occur too infrequently to grow too attached to characters
- Some perks still feel too weak and some traits feel odd
- Achievements aren't particularly exciting (feels more like things you'll just get from playing rather than goals to shoot for)
- Game has crashed while autosaving, corrupting my ironman save so I don't play true ironman anymore (even after Avast fix)

Neutral:
- RNG. It's not bad in this game. I find it much more reasonable and easier to mitigate than in XCOM. But if you'll go ballistic because an arrow one shots your leather wearing brother then you better not play this. You'll miss 80% shots just like you'll hit 20% shots. Random happens but I've always felt that if a battle went poorly, it has been my fault.

56,32369894,english,"Well here was an odd, pleasant surprise, I must say....

I love turn based strategy games. Jump on any decent ones whenever I see them, and try out discounted or ""odd"" ones I dont. 80% of the latter usually turn out to be lame, or disapointing, and end up collecting dust in my steam library.

But once and a while, you find one that turns out to have ""the magic""....That addicting quality that makes you ask ""Why did I spend all this time playing THIS""...Or the the games that make you say ""One more turn....I have only been late to work twice this week, one more time....Well the boss will get over it...In 100 years, its not like it will matter anyways.""

And BATTLE BROTHERS is one such game. So here we go....

WHAT IS IT?

I would say BB is a turn based rpg, but thats really not the case here. I would call it more of a talking-heads-low-fantasy-oh crap my best swordsmen just died-brutal mercenary sim. Something like that.....But I would prolly need an acronym if I did. huh?
You start with three mercenaries, battered and in a battle where there leader gets obliterated right in front of you, and yelling at the screen for him to block wont work (tried it)....He be dead and now you are the proud owner of a broke as hell, beaten up, low on provisions and medical supplies (as well as tools, and ammo....I guess the guy who took provision inventory was one of those you watch die, and Karma got his ass for not keeping things stocked....But anyways...) mercenary company with an astonishing 2 whole members. THANKS Hothgar you son of a..... But dont worry, you have a LITTLE gold, and your job is to become the company that saves the princess!!! Er....Actually there IS no princess plot here....Old habits just die hard....But you DO get to kick ALOT of ass, after you spend some time getting your ass kicked building up again, that is....

Gameplay/Graphics.

The game consists of randomly generated sandbox worlds filled with towns and ruins. You travel overland looking for jobs from these towns, or ""contacts"" which, when fulfilled, give you much needed gold. And I mean MUCH needed. Your men have a salary, you need tools for repairs, rations to feed your company, and medical supplies for those pesky boo boos you get when some bandit slams you upside the head with a battle axe. And those expenses dont even BEGIN to cover it all, as you will need to equip your men with VERY important gear. Armor, helms, sheild, and so forth. And since gear is breakable if is takes to much damage without repairs, there is NEVER a such thing as too much gold. And when it comes to recruitable mercs, there are many to choose from, From rat-catchers in the sewer (you didnt think you were getting through this without the rats in the sewer, now did you? Dont worry, it just SAYS he does this...The game spares you from catching them in the sewers yourself) to hedge knights and Swordmasters. Or you could recuit farmhands, masons, lumberjacks. You can fill your ranged back line with Witch hunters, deer hunters, or thieves and poachers. There seems to be an infinite number of possibilities.

Which reminds me....There are random events. And some of these only happen (or can only lead to a reward) if you have the right class with you. SO build your company carefully. Random events can be cliche to original to outright hillarious. These events are all done in text, sadly. But hey, nothing wrong with a bit of light reading now and then.Battles are turn based. You can have up to 20 members, but only 12 in the active party at a time. Battles look like a boardgame, with ""heads"" or portraits representing your people. It put me off at first, being one who prefers next-gen graphic like Xcom or TW Warhammer, or even Mordhiem (which looks fantastic for the price) but this game has great gameplay and a charm that kinda grows on ya. Battles are VERY brutal. And kind of realistic in a way many games dont mess with. One slip up....One underestimated enemy. One peice of gear you forgot to repair, or one injured merc you forgot to put in reserve to rest, could get one of your hard-groomed, high level characters decapitates (yes, your ""head"" can lose its head....Um....Well you gotta SEE it and youll know what I mean!) Deaths can be permentant or a ""knock down"", ussually permenant, as ailments and injuries can be as well, especially if you dont let the injured rest or get them treated at a temple. For a game that at first glance looked like a joke (I mean ""heads""...""Battle brothers?""....Who writes this stuff?) this game doesnt joke around when it comes to brutality.

 Other then this, I dont want to spoil anything else...That should give you enough of an idea of the gameplay. Graphically, it looks like a 16 bit nintendo game. Which is why I found myself asking myself....""Why did I like this GAME so much?""

Because it works the magic those 16 bit games once worked. 

And for the younger millenials who dont know that magic, its like this....In MY generation, Nintendo and Sega were at war. And because of that competion, and the fact that 90% of all games were exclusive to thier consoles, developers were working tirelessly at being ""different"" then thier competitors, and puting alot of thought and care into game mechanics and it resulted in games that are STILL legendary franchises to this day. This game feels like it was pulled right out of that era. Its a PC game, of course. But what it doesnt have in graphics, it makes up for in fun factor and gameplay. I liked the music, as well. It was really fitting for a low fantasy setting. But this is MY review, and if I dont want to make a MUSIC section, the 1th amendment confirms the right that I dont HAVE to if I dont want to!

Overall

Its fun and casual. Not great, not poor, but for its price range, and how entertaining it is...Its a must if your in between ""epic"" releases, or just want to burn up 30 or 40 hours, and it has HUGE replayability. SO yeah, I highly recommend it to tactical/turn based rpg fans who want something to kill the time and enjoy. I tell you this much though....If this gameplay had the graphics of, say...X-com....It would be an international sensation and a huge hit. Because they just dont make the gameplay in turn based games this fun anymore very often. Everyones to busy trying to make action games out of our genre. 

They need to stop that! I dont believe in ""action rpgs""....There are ONLY action games or rpgs...Period!

59,32330481,english,"One of the best turn based strategy games that I've played in a very long time.  One of the best qualities in my opinion is that there really are a lot of different workable strategies that you can use to build your team.  You could opt to have a number of your guys carry spears to hold the enemy off while picking away with archers.  You could draw them in and play defense while you hit them with pikes from the back row.  Use flails and you can aim for the head to try to preserve their armor as a spoil, or uses hammers to destroy it.  Do you focus on spending your money on better weapons to take the enemy out faster, or heavier armor (which may also exhaust your men), or focus on hiring better mercs?  Speaking of hiring, one of the most realistic parts of the game is that you don't get to see the stats of the people you hire before you hire them.  Instead, you can hire the farmer, the mason, the ex-sodier, the knight, etc.  I think there must be 15-20 job backgrounds, and while some may trend better than others, its possible you could spend a ton on hiring a knight whos only as good as that farmer you hired for peanuts.

With three difficult settings its possible to ease your way into the world, while still enjoying playing the ironman mode (only one save).  Yes, it is absolutely gutting to watch that crossbowman that you've been raising from a measly poacher to a killing machine lose a eye in battle and become useless with a bow.  At the same time its kinda what makes this game great.  Also a great way to learn.  Watching your best fighter bleed out because you were too cheap to equip your men with bandages is a painful lesson.  A big part of this game is learning not to bite off more than you can chew, but typically those lessons are leard the hard way the first time around.  

In my opinion the negatives are few and minor.  If you are looking for a deep story, this probably isn't the place for you.  Every one in a while you'll come across an amusing background or interaction, but this is really more of a sandbox game.  The setup of a world altering crisis sounds better on paper than it works out being.  Basically the early game is just trying to build a team, get them outfitted, etc.  Mid game is a lot of focusing on getting money to improve the equipment and get the team stronger for the late game crisis.  I've only played 2 of the 3 of them, and its neat to see cities destroyed (well neat they can be, disheartening when you've been building up that relationship).  The only flaw is that you don't really have a good feel that you are a part of ending it.  Very little feedback on how the wars are going.

Battle brothers is not for everyone, I'll be honest about that, it hasn't got the prettiest graphics and it requires a bit of thought in your decisions. That being said if you can get past the initial difficulty curve (and it's not a massively hard one) this becomes one hell of a rewarding game to play. This is a game where your characters, with all their hard-earned skill, can be killed at a moments notice if you're not careful. It's a game where you can lose hours of painstaking progress levelling up a character simply because you forgot to give him a helmet. But fuck me if it isn't rewarding.

Taking a brawler from one of the starting locations and forging him into a steel-clad badass with a greatsword is one hell of a feeling. Marching into the center of an orc warband and in your head screaming ""come get me"". All the time aware that one misstep can send your character down permanently. And I do mean permanently - permadeath is a key mechanic of this game and you will not be able to avoid it.

Whilst the game, in my opinion, is absolutely fantastic, it still has one things I would like to see in updates or perhaps a sequel if it sells enough to warrant one: whilst I understand the low-fantasy setting and thus the lack of having magic available I would love for that to become a mechanic in the game.

68,32227433,english,"TL:DR Highly recommended for fans of turn-based tactical games!

Longer version:
Battle Brothers is a turn-based tactical game consisting of 2 layers of gameplay:
(1) The tactical / combat layer, where your band of mercenaries engages in hex-tile based tactical battles against enemies like brigands, undead, orcs, and other medieval fantasy enemies.
(2) The strategic / map layer where you move around procedurally generated maps to grab quests, explore, and ""do the economy"".

The tactical layer is competent and fleshed out, providing gameplay elements like positioning your bros properly, flanking, holding the line, protecting ranged units, making use of elevation advantages as well as managing your bros resources (e.g. fatigue, action points, abilities, etc.). It's highly satisfying to enter a battle and get out of it with no bro dead and your bags full of loot and some upgrades.

Speaking of which, the strategic layer is also fine. Basically, you travel around the map, scouting villages for equipment upgrades, new mercenary hires, quests, and rare goods that you can sell for a profit in other towns. You'll also grab some random dialogue-based events while on the road (e.g. do you buy beer from a travelling monk or do you plunder his wares?) and random battles (e.g. against a group of brigands or werewolves).

Character / party management consists of (1) assigning obtained loot like helmets, armor, weapons, shields, etc. to your mercs appropriate to the next incoming battle, (2) stat upgrades / level-ups and perks in accordance to designated roles like shield bro, 2h weapon bro, ranged bro, or banner bro.

74,32175974,english,"TL:DR - Battle Bothers is a curious turn based tactics game but suffers from problems with interface, feedback to the user, poor character development and repetitive combat.


Battle Brothers is an interesting game to review, particularly in that the game has a base of hard core followers who likely invested at an early stage.  

A brief introduction to the game: Battle Brothers is a turn based hex tile tactcal game with real time world map exploration.  As the few survivors of a mercenary band, your job is to scour the world in search of new members and contracts to earn a living.  In a nut shell your time will be divided between hiring and equipping recruits and fighting in turn based combat.  

Starting out: Battle Brothers lacks any in-game tutorial.  There are Youtube tutorials linked in the game which will consume 40 minutes of your time without actually playing the game.  The interface for Battle Brothers is adequate but clunky. Typical minor gripes include GUI occluding map locations, requiring zoom to work around and poor click snap onto key locations such as towns which are consequently annoying to select.  Unforgivable is the mess that is tactical combat.  With environmental impacts not well flagged, the use of ranged skills can be incredibly frustrating, particularly in the first hours of play.  This system is not currently working well with the hexagonal layout. It is also not easy to determine which terrain is passable at a glance, and there is no tactical overlay function available. 

Hiring mercenaries is a bit of a lottery.  The game gives a background on available characters but does not give their stats so there is no way to determine if the character of same base class asking for a higher fee is better than another.  

Getting over the humps of the interface, the combat is quite enjoyable, though highly repetitive.   Severe limitation of unique classes renders 3 broad types of character: sword 'n board, two handed and ranged.  It doesn't take terribly long before every combat plays out in the same way.  The weapon types are nice with each category offering unique attacks. 
 Sadly weapon descriptions do not indicate what these attacks are, you will simply need to know from experience. 
 Combat is slow owed to low hit rates combined with turn based interface and this can be particularly irksome where the enemy has shields and you have no shield breaker to hand (only two weapon types can break shields effectively).  

Characters progress by gaining experience as they engage in combat.  Each mercenary level allows the player to assign base attributes and a new perk to improve their combat performance.  Increments to base stats are extremely small, requiring several levels to attain a noticable difference.  Perks feel rather insipid and 'safe'.  All base mercenaries are offered an identical perk set, which is a little disappointing.  As your characters develop you will feel more confident to take on more difficult contracts (which can be identified by the number of skulls above the contract icon, another little gem the game fails to tell you).  Mercenaries die, in fact they can die a lot.  The dice rolls mean your favourite mercenary can die in a single turn simply through bad luck. 

I find it difficult to recommend Battle Brothers, particularly at this price tag.  The experience simply isn't smooth enough, nor does the game feel fully fleshed out to a final release state.  I note that my own opinion is at odds with the vast majority of users here.  This may be partially attributable to a hardcore fan base, so do consider this while perusing reviews.

77,31840847,english,"TO SUM IT UP
A good turn based game sadly plagued by its un-generosity in everything it does and with no consideration whatsoever for the player's time.

The game is frustrating and an invitation for save scumming to most players while being appealing to a minority of hardcore masochists/fetichists (which is indeed a niche market for sure).

But it still definitely itches the turn base tactical genre as my playtime shows.
Too bad it is just so damn stingy in every aspect (poor loot and itemisation, hit chances jokes, enemy marksmen and their magical arrows, and a lack of content that calls for enrichment by DLC which i would gladly pay for).



--- WHY PUT A NEGATIVE REVIEW ?
It is a game not respectful of the player's time in the end. You need to invest lots of time for little rewards in a gritty to the point of frustrating system.
But if you have lots of time to kill like I do at the moment and are not prone to punching your desk, go for it.

It will take you more than a 100 hours to fully perceive how frustrating some mechanics can be, how the named loot is insanely rare and disapointing, how insanely slow the game speed is (hint : use cheat engine speed hack after the discovery phase), and just how repetitive this gets with such bothersome fatigue mechanics, conbat maps, or resolve stat, only used for 1 enemy but without which you can not do anything against them.



--- THE PERK SYSTEM
... is deeply flawed with some almost mandatory perks and far too many useless ones (or niche ones that the game over-gritiness does not let you explore anyway).

Below are a few gripes after spending a long time with the game (besides the lack of ANY generosity in design throughout).


--- THE INTERFACE
The interface is a bit too basic basic and in need of a an upgrade to more modern standards (buy/sell back, flexibility of repairs from any inventory display, buybacks, better retire system, load button available everywhere, autoloot not looting human flesh, have the activable option to see the recruits characteristics for those who want to).


--- ABOUT MAPS GENERATION
The map generations are pretty awful both for the main map randomly seed generated AND the battle maps and their characterictics :

- the main map generated at each start will have you start games over and over to get a decent map, with decent bros to start with if that matters to you. The main problem is the map generation which there again generates too many crappy maps lacking resources, lacking harbors, lacking missions somehow. This matters A LOT to the game you will experience and will probably have lots of players bouncing back from an awful start which happens 80% of the time just because of poor, then again un-generous, procedural algorithms.

- the battle maps have multiple biomes whichis good. But they are too often poor for battles not so much because of their characteritics but because of uninspired generation of the maps.
Let's say you attack a party roaming the land in the hills. Well the map will randomly put you in a position with enemies atop the hills. Not only will enemy marksmen or goblins will slaughter your troops from there, the pure slog to go through elevation with your bros is just an insanely boring game. I don't bother anymore with shitty map battle and just reload the autosave to get a different configuration.
Why not have the enemy in a position of force when they sometimes ambush you, but the whole ""sometimes you can't win battles"" motto just to excuse for piss poor map settings is just awful. This aspect of the game is insanely poor compared to the more polished turn based fight system.",1495202638,1496416617,False,9,0,0.475381463766098022,0,True,False,False,76561198024469649,328,74,12730,0,9343,1496841963,,

Despite my initial concerns, there is a gritty realism to the game (relatively speaking - there are giant orcs) that is supported by clever writing and good ambience (music, random events) which also appeals to the RPG fan in me.

81,32110346,english,"Before i even start, i want to say that this game is extemely good. It could very easily be perfect, but more on that later.
I have 90 hours on this game, and i'm still on my first playthrough (i'm not playing on ironman.). Alot of people talk about replayability and i havent even gotten through my first run yet. The core gameplay of the game is very entertaining, and in that way it reminds me of X-com. On the surface it looks like it would be repetitive, but the sheer amount of diffilculty keeps it fresh and enjoyable. Mind you, its not unfair, but it is tough and your crew of mercenaries are in no way supermen. As a matter of fact they are very human, and you WILL lose them (permanently)  and they WILL get permanent injuries and this is a big part of the game. In this way it reminds me of Darkest Dungeon, except your team is more replaceable in Battle Brothers. 
Progressing in Battle Brothers feel extremely rewarding. You really feel like you earned that new armor or that cool new axe, as you don't just stumble across it, no you actually have to fight somebody that are better equipped than you. You might be outnumbered and you might lose a few guys in a big battle, but looking at your surviving soldiers, decked out in new armor/weapons afterwards, makes it all the worthwile. 
I will however give a word of warning: The frustration in this game can get very real. Fighting an almost perfect battle, only to watch one of your best soldiers get sniped by a lucky archer, from across the battlefield, makes you wanna punch your computer. Watching the domino effect, as one soldiers looses morale, and starts fleeing, only to provoke attacks of opportunity and get killed, and thereby causes more of your soldiers to break, is also rough. Accepting a contract, and finding out that there is no way in hell you are srong enough to complete it, and you have to cancel it and thereby ruining the reputation with whatever faction you are working for. All of this is frustrating, but an important part of this game, as it is a constant assestment of risk vs reward.

sadly as you play along this game, you realise that there could be so much more to this game. For example theres only 1 playable race(humans). You cant even get mercenaries from the other races (orcs, goblin, undead). I really feel it's  a missed opportunity to get a more diverse band of mercenaries. 
Theres very little story in the game, and story quests doesnt exist. There are a few number of crisis, and you will get contracts that have something to do with them, but they are generic, and not really story related. I really feel this is a shame, since you come to care for your little rag tag mercenary band, and i'd love if there was more to that. Maybe just small stories that took part over 10-15 contracts and let to special rewards, either in form of unique mercenaries, unique traits to your existing mercenaries, that would make you feel even more attached to them.
It would also suit the game to have some form of city building aspect, especially towards the late game when you are starting to have a mean band of mercenaries, and you start to make more money that you know what to do with. The ability to build your own hamlet or guild hall and maybe even hire some of the roaming mercenary bands to assist or complete contracts for you. Make your little town take place in the intrigues between the noble families and stuff like that. Giving out your extra mercenaries jobs in the village, like training a militia to defend it for example. I dunno, it's just an idea, but i think it would be fun, having that extra aspect..
Also, and i feel like this is the most important thing: If there ever was a game that has modding potential, this is it. I feel like a lot of my problems with the lack of content, would be fixed by passionate modders. PLease open up to modding ASAP :D

After three failed companies, I've finally managed to keep everyone alive for more than a couple of battles. Turns out arming farmers with clubs and straw hats isn't very effective, though they are easy to replace. 

I sincerely hope this game is the start of a franchise.

The low-power element to this game is what sold me. You will barely scratch by. You will lose your favorite party members. Everyone will die. Your mercenaries will desert you because you were dumb enough to go exploring without enough money to pay their daily wages. Eventually, you'll start getting victories and earning more gold. Eventually, you'll have a standard to take into battle with you.

If you're looking for a high fantasy game with a bunch of overpowered uberknights wielding magic fire swords who must save the sacred fairy kingdom from the dark lord of Etheria and his army of fallen angel centaur paladins, look elsewhere.

There are only a few cons. I'd like to see more content but the game is great as is. The game world is simple, so it feels malleable enough to build more complex storylines. I'd also like to have the ability to choose my mercenaries' formation before they enter a battle (can you do that?) and maybe more weapon choices. Other than that, I highly recommend this game if you like slow, deliberate strategy. The battles feel like a game of chess.

88,32020596,english,"It's obvious that I love this game or I won't be playing it this much. But I will try to be as impartial as possible in my review.

Let's start with the best part: The music. 
Truly breathtaking arrangement. Very atmospheric and thematic. The cue is perfect. It gets my adrenaline going and makes battle tense despite it being a turn-based tactic game.

The next best part is the gameplay that's tightly woven in the setting of the game. In one part Battle Brothers is actually a sim game where as a leader of a mercenary band, you're managing the welfare of your personnel. You recruits, take jobs, shop for stuff, manage morale, decide stuff, and all kinds of things that mercenary leaders do. It's quite deep in that regard.

The other part of the game is the robust turn-based tactical combat. Thanks to the low-fantasy medieval setting. There is no magic in the game. There's not even healing. When your soldier got injured, he more or  else fucked for the fight. You better get him out of the way or risk death. 

Through the process of learning the game, I was surprised to found myself using actual historical strategy and formation in battle. I outfit my soldiers according to their function in my tactics. That's how deep the combat system is. No longer can I just charge down the enemy with my best soldier like in any other turn-bases tactic game. I have to approach every battle carefully or risk death.

Now on to the part that could be improved:
The difficulty curve. Just like in every other sim game of this kind. The hardest part of Battle Brothers is actually the very beginning of the game. A single mistake or unlucky roll of a dice could set you back big time or can even ruin your campaign. Although, a smooth beginning still won't guarantee an easy campaign as the game absolutely love to throw a wrench your way. But you better off restarting a ruined early game rather than powering through as I found it often ends up as an exercise of futility rather than fun.

Things that are bad but can't be helped:
The lack of animation. The graphics and art direction are fine. I actually love it. But the lack of animation really hurt the immersion. But It's understandable though, devs probably don't have that much of a budget to do the animation. But it really shows in the end product. Battle Brothers would be a much more enjoyable experience if they have animation.

All in all, Battle Brothers is truly a gem of game. A little rough here and there. But to me personally, in medieval setting exclusively, Battle Brothers have the best turn-based tactic combat I've ever played.

It is still a very good game like a board game dark soul
but there still have room to improve
like storyline, some interaction with NPC (not only join the fight, some real interaction)
the map should be bigger, more item should be include like weapon. the gap between weak and strong weapon are too large.
Also, i can see the passion while i found out orc and goblin have their own weapon, but that is totally useless to the player unless u have some crazy idea or u want your soldier reach the max fatigue just coz he swing the orc axe for once.
As i said about the old version, the mission is so repeating. It is still challenging, it is still not easy to fight 10~20 orc, but it
is exhausted to kill the same thing again and again.

still look forward to have something more, is a great game, just lost focus if u play for a while

War chess can be very boring but this one is different since every step you made can kill ur soldier accidentally. This force you to think more and stop you to do stupid thingsssss( like me..)

Some shortcomings exist in this game of coz. Like there is no story and only have few types of mission. I am having fun but I just feel like'Yes i keep killing and lv up, but what for?'.

[b]But First...[/b]
You're a fan of strategy games like Xcom or Jagged Alliance? A fan of strategy games with depth but yet heavy on RNG? It's likely that this game is for you. If you're not familiar with this type of games, let me put it straight. This game is great, amazing even but it won't hold your hand, it's not going to get easier any time soon and you will lose, often and in the most brutal of ways. Now that you've been warned, let's get to the review.

[b]Leading a mercenary company[/b]
Battle Brothers is about re-building a mercenary company that has been reduced to only 3 men. The game is all about managing and hiring mercenaries, you will be able to hire a ton of them each with their own traits and backgrounds. A lot of them will die, so my advice is to avoid becoming attached. You will be able to equip them with various armours and weapons, each of these weapon sporting different abilities and uses making the choice of loadout between each battle very important. With each level up you'll be able to increase your men's stats and assign them perks, up to 10 of them for each mercenary. Random events will happen sometimes having your men interacting with eachother or sometimes interacting with the environment or the different cities you'll be visiting. Each of these little torsos can be renamed and providing you found a barber shop you'll be able to slightly customize their appearance. Overall, character development is in depth and learning what works and what doesn't will take a lot of experimenting for the new player.

[b]The map[/b]
When you're not fighting or picking contracts in a town, you're moving around a pretty big map of the world. This big piece of land will take you from northern snowy peaks to dry southern deserts. There's a day & night cycle which can affect how the combat goes once you enter it. You're company is represented by a little torso waving your chosen banner and travel time can be altered to move faster. Overall, you'll be roaming from town to town completing different contracts in order to gain some renown and crowns (the game's currency). Each town have their own shops and trade goods, also their own reputation systeme which is influenced by your actions towards said town. Spread all over the map are camps and creepy ruins in which you'll encounter various enemies, from bandits to walking corpses. Even though the concept can be repetitive, the variety of the contracts, enemies and loot can keep you going for a lot of hours, especially if you're an achiever. After many days in a single playthrough, special events called ''Late game crisis'' will appear, which will test your skills to their limits. There's 3 different types, a war between the different noble houses spread across the land, a greenskin invasion or the rise of a mighty undead scourge. Each have their own stories, events and enemies. 

[b]The combat[/b]
Battles are turn based and happen on an hexagon grid. Most of the time, it consists of 2 formations facing eachother face to face. Each action will build up fatigue and action points so managing these ressources properly is very important. Will you hit? Will you wait and set up a shieldwall? It's all things that you will have to decide carefully. Overall it's very simple but effective. The landscape and elevation can affect your % to hit or evasion, also can serve as cover. It's all about positioning your brothers properly... A slight error can sometimes mean death, a painful one where heads go flying in the air.

[b]The Positive[/b]

- Combat is simple, fun and there's a lot of strategy involved in order to succeed with minimal casualties.
- The RNG is accurate, which makes the rolls fair for each side.
- A lot of different gear to equip your mercs with makes for a lot of different approach to battle.
- While simple, the art-style is very detailed and well done. Injuries show on your brothers and so does every piece of equipment.
- Sound effects are clear, effective and indicative of what's going on.
- A lot of replayability and since everything including the map is randomly generated at the beginning of a game it makes every playthrough different.
- A true sandbox, you're not limited to do something, there's no actual end-game even though you may retire your company whenever you feel like it. Content scales with the days passing on the map... Very well made sandbox experience overall.
- There's a lot of perks and stats to play with, which makes character development fun and diversified.

[b]The Negative[/b]

- Can be repetitive after a while, contracts type are a little limited.
- Could have more content and enemies.
- Does not support the workshop, so no kickass mods.
- Can be frustrating for people who have a hard time handling heavy RNG.
- Even on beginner, this game is not easy and the lack of tutorial makes the learning curve quite steep. Apart from tutorial videos this game could benefit from a basic tutorial explaining things like the Zones of control or over-the-shoulder shooting.

[b]Overall[/b]
In the end, Battle Brothers is very unique, no game does this. The combat is fun and engaging, character customization is well balanced and you will most likely find yourself hooked for many hours. It can become repetitive but the many late game crisis and events make up for it. The style and graphics aren't over the top but they serve their purpose well and create a neat low-fantasy atmosphere. It's a well crafted sandbox game and ...

You have a warchest of 2000 crowns -- just enough to hire those whose eagerness to join the ranks of [i]societates fortunae[/i] far outstrips their ability to wield a weapon. Can you rebuild your company? Can you earn the trust of the noble houses? Can you make Captain Bernhard and One-Eye proud?

There's certainly plenty of opportunity for those in the business of war to profit here. Brigands keep a keen eye on the roads waiting for easy pickings. Creatures of the night which can rip a man apart or swallow him whole roam the lands. And out there in the borderlands lie the greenskins, salivating at the opportunity to wipe out all of humanity. Caravans will need escorts; villages will need protection; venerated relics must be retrieved.

It's all easier said than done. Even experienced strategy gamers might be taken aback by the game's brutal and uncompromising nature. This is partly due to the complexity of the fantastic turn-based combat system. Morale, fatigue and positioning all come into play. One man surrounded by mere brigands might turn to flee while another might grip his warband firmly and grin wolfishly at the target-rich environment. The terrible worm may be safely ensconced in his iron cocoon but he'll not dance nimbly about the battlefield. The marksman perched on high ground will find it easier to put ""the eye to the cord, the cord to the shaft, and the shaft to the mark.""

You'll need every advantage you can get because the AI in the game is pretty damn good and reason enough to look askance at the efforts of larger game developers. Direwolves filled with bestial rage will throw themselves mindlessly at your spearwall and desperate thugs are little better but raiders display cunning and sense of self-preservation, wolfriders circle around your frontline seeking your vulnerable archers and fully-armoured orc warriors are flat out terrifying the first time you encounter them. This variety in AI behaviour makes a game that invites multiple playthroughs over multiple weeks or months a pleasure to replay.

And replay it you will because the game is marvellously compelling. Just one more contract. One more battle. One more hire. One more level up. One more ambition achieved. Expect hour after hour to quickly fly past as you rebuild your company, turning your riffraff of no import into sellswords of fabled renown.

As one historian noted, however, prowess was not easily bought. Life as a battle brother is nasty, brutish and decidedly short and your men's heads have a disconcerting tendency to fall off after several days of service. If your fishermen, farmhands, masons and miners are to survive their early skirmishes against brigands, they must have arms and armour, neither of which come cheap, both of which require regular maintenance. Hiring fees must be paid up front, wages must be paid daily and provisions must be procured. The lack of money and manpower will be acutely felt in the early stages of the campaign. 

Ultimately, the challenge has less to do with the economy, the enemy AI, the RNG or the complexity of the combat and more to do with decision-making. Few games will punish terrible decisions as severely and as early as this one. One mistake is not likely to end a campaign but a succession of mistakes in short order will result in the death spiral of any company. Your numbers will be too few to take on more dangerous contracts and your treasury, too small to beef up your company, dwindles daily. Desperation sets in and you're forced to take a contract you would otherwise turn down. Your men are faced with overwhelming odds. Win and you return to the path to prosperity. Lose and it's all over. You now know what must have been going through Captain Bernhard's mind in his final moments.

With mistakes so heavily punished, retreat is no disgrace. You are no chivalric ideal, no virtuous avatar meant to bring enlightenment to the lands. You're a businessman, pure and simple, and you don't get paid if you're dead. Leave the heroic last stands to the gloryhound nobles and their lickspittle military. Learn when to hold and when to fold, when to fight and when to flee.

The imperious highborn and the fat-pursed merchants may think lowly of you but who is to say how you will be remembered? If history tells us a sellsword once deemed diabolical would be hailed by some as a secular saint at his career's end, which will you be: some misbegotten sons of malediction reviled and quickly forgotten or a company whose deeds are still remembered years later?

POSITIVES:
- Battles are great. They are brutal, balanced, easy to understand, full of taking risks vs playing safe. They factor in fatigue, morale, various attacks vs various defenses (like flails VS shields), and all in all, great fun.
- Your units gain experience and get better and better equipment (hopefully), yet they won't turn into supermen. A few bad decisions and they just die like anyone else.
- The mood of the game is great, it is gritty and desperate, full of believable moments. 

NEGATIVES:
- The game is mostly about battling. It is not really a sandbox in that sense that you cannot be a trader or merchant or slaver or anything else, like in Mount&Blade. Just a bunch of mercenaries, fighting.

31,31697145,english,"Battle Brothers puts you in command of a small mercenary band seeking to make a name for itself, and to earn money.
You control individual soldiers, their loadout, their skill growth, and their moves in battle. It is a pretty interesting tactical game, but it quickly gets repetitive as there isn't a lot of variation to be had and most of your experience will be walking around and occasional bandit fights. That said, what content is there works well and is enjoyable.

Your loadout matters most of the time, with different weapons giving different options in battle, leading to easy to understand choices that you can easily see impact your battles along with most of the time it being easy to see where and how you made mistakes.
A lot of Battle Brothers is about survival, as the real enemy isn't the bandits, greenskins or undead, though they all provide a different challenge, but attrition. As you need to level up your mercenaries, you'll end up having to protect them. And it then feels unfair when you have to level up every one of your brothers from nearly nothing while the game generates enemies for you at higher levels with the idea that you should be able to take them by then. Once you fall behind on the curve and lose a few more fights to now-superior opponents there is no real coming back as there is practically nothing left to fight that won't just murder everyone in your group. If you did not earn enough money to buy good equipment, or you couldn't find the better equipment, you just fell behind on the curve and it will be more and more difficult to catch back up. Assuming it is at all possible.

For a game that seems to take hints from X-com and similar hard games, it feels arbitrary. You are always limited to at most 12 men in your combat formation, while you will quickly find enemies do not have such a limit. Enemies do not need to worry about losing their highly trained men, so they just throw themselves at you- After all, they just get generated from nothing to give you a fight and they don't care if they survive. Then you notice the world feels empty and artificial, as things are generated just to fight you and nothing else seems to happen without you explicitly making it happen by accepting a contract. The fact that the world is randomly generated and seems to not be too interested in making roads and villages fit the terrain doesn't help it either. While I like the idea of the map being randomly generated and it occasionally seems to come up with a good map, it feels like the majority of them are pretty poor in many aspects, though thankfully no map seed is terrible to the point it can't be dealt with by a tactics and strategy change.

There are no fights outside of nature, even if you accept a contract to fight in a siege and the text says you push through the gate of the citadel, only to find it is a grassy plain just like every other plain out there. You may be asked to enter a mausoleum for an artifact, or a graveyard to get rid of grave robbers, but these too are just empty grassy plains and maybe hills.
Without a doubt, it feels like they did not pay attention to the details, and things weren't really worked out that well, leading to it feeling frustrating and what should have been a climax- A siege on a stone citadel during a war between noble houses- Instead just became a disappointment as it was just another fight on a field of grass.

But all that said, it remains a positive experience. being able to name your mercenaries and build them in the way you like(Though most of them will be pretty standard simply because the reality of combat makes some things highly impractical), the flavour text and random events are amusing and interesting. Armour and weapons can be looted from the enemy after combat, and the looks of your men change with their injuries and equipment. 

Battle Brothers is a flawed but still enjoyable game, if you are okay with being frustrated often and a lot of doing battles that feel the same over and over. What is there is pretty good, but it feels like there is definitely too much of the same and it never seems to go anywhere. It's worth getting if you are interested in team management and fighting against attrition, but for everyone that isn't a big fan of turn based tactical combat I'd say wait for a sale. Or you're just going to end up frustrated and annoyed.",1494574778,1494574902,True,9,0,0.526820003986358643,2,True,False,False,76561198002567771,496,99,12434,0,3592,1559315894,,

42,31639287,english,"This game was recommended to me by someone who suggested it is similar to XCOM and Darkest Dungeon, and a good choice for fans of turn based RPG/rogue-like games. In truth this game should not even be compared to such great games, as this is on a completely different level of quality. It feels like an early access game, even though it apparantly graduated from alpha status. 

A lot of the gameplay mechanics are either not listed, or difficult to identify. Basic things like health, stamina, you know things that are kind of important to be aware of, I couldnt even find. The combat UI is an absolute mess. During combat there are RNG rolls and different calculations taking place behind each action, or at least I think there is. The RNG mechanics dont seem to work, at least not very well. For example 75% chance to hit, as most would assume that is a relatively good chance and would most likely connect, right? Nope. 

My entire band of 9 mercenaries were all slaughtered by two wolves. What should have been a simple skirmish quickly devolved into a giant and recurring middle finger from the RNG rolls. Merc one hits, miss. Two hits, miss. Three hits, miss. My entire team of NINE mercs somehow all missed their attacks. Now if the average chance to hit for them was 70%, I am unsure how it is possible for NINE rolls of 70% chance to fail. Either it was an astronomical coincidence, or the RNG system is broken.

Oh did I mention the wolves all did instakill crit hits? Seriously. You cannot imagine how infuriating it is to watch your entire team of mercs get ganked by a couple of wolves. Its permadeath mind you, so basically my entire game was over and necessitated a restart from the beginning. Its one of those games where the devs dont want to spend the time or resources on programming an intelligent AI, so basically they implement cheats, so the AI has totally different algorithms for their RNG, resulting in a one sided unbalanced gank fest.

The game isnt all bad though. I actually was having fun up until the wolves drive by. Despite being rough around the edges (very rough around the edges) the game is enjoyable. There are no animations during fights, which I knew going into this game, but damn the reality of it is so much worse. Its basically chess, the characters move to a spot, and when you attack nothing happens. It would have made the worlds difference if they made even a shoddy looking sword swing, something, anything but standing idle. 

There are no voice overs, its all text that you need to read. There is no real story/plot either. At first there is some very slight direction, a tutorial of sorts that gives you an objective, but after that your on your own. That freedom can definately be a good thing, but freedom without ANY direction starts to make you wonder what the point of it all is.

Overall I did enjoy my short time with this game. The problem is, with such broken and unpredictable combat mechanics, I am quite simply unwilling to dedicate time and effort into building something that can be permanently ripped away, unfairly at that. Permadeath is a great gameplay mechanic, like in Darkest Dungeon. If I loose people because of a stupid mistake or poor planning, thats totally fine, lesson learned. But when I loose people because of cheating AI or beyond unlucky RNG roll cheats, thats a different story. I can only imagine how upsetting it would have been if the wolf drive by had happened 5 or 10 hours into the game. At least its not too late for a refund.

[h1]Positive[/h1]

The writing and art is exceptional for a game from such a small team. Many different events crop up randomly but in a naturalistic way steaming from each character's background. There's lots of room here to try all sorts of builds with a wide variety of different weapons, all of which have their own advantages and disadvantages. Combat (the majority of the game) is satisfying and easy to understand, yet very challenging to maximize. You need to anticipate the most effective party set up ahead of challenging encounters. Exploration feels fresh in each new game due to the world map using a random seed.

Sticking with the characters you recruit and develop from the start of the game hurts you in the long-run. The most expensive men have higher base stats, and you'll need to begin rotating them in as the game goes on.

This can be especially frustrating if you find a unique weapon but have no one that was spec'ed to use it.

Updated Review

The Game:

Battle Brothers is a turn-based strategy game where you lead a mercenary band in a medieval fantasy world.



After a battle that goes wrong you become the captain of a small mercenary group and lead them in a low magic fantasy world. Your band will face dangers ranging from human bandits all the way to vampires. You will have to build them up from scratch through ways like looting defeated enemies, doing quests for villages or noble houses.


The game has 2 main parts. The large map where you travel around fighting enemies and doing quests and the battle area where the turn-based combat takes place. The large map is procedurally generated so different playthroughs aren't usually the same. From there you can go to towns to trade for provisions and equipment for your mercenary group, and recruit new members for your party. Each town has it's own economy and these are sometimes affected by quests or bandits. Different towns also give different kinds of recruits, so poorer towns usually have farmhands usually while richer ones have knights available. There are also random events while traveling the map. These usually happens depending on the backgrounds of your battle brothers. Some benefit others, some clash causing negative results. It makes traveling around the map more dynamic and less of a boring walk from one place to another. 


The battle area is also procedurally generated so thinking on your feet is needed to win battles. You can field a maximum of 12 battle brothers at a time. Sadly there isn't much you can do with your formations so for me, that limits the tactical possibilities for the player. Permadeath is a major part of the game so a bad damage roll can usually end the life of a battle brother quickly if he isn't equipped well enough. There are a variety of perks and weapons to choose from making it easy for specialization of troops. Though not all troops are created equal, those from more well off backgrounds are usually better suited to combat and are better objectively.

In combat there are a lot of factors that come into play not just hp and damage. There is a morale mechanic in place which can sway the battle for better or worse in a single turn if you luck is good or bad enough. This is complemented by the multiple possible traits of each battle brother. Some traits make them more likely to hit opponents, some less likely to run away, though some traits are negative. These are assigned randomly when you first recruit them. Making the best out of every battle brother is key to surviving this harsh world.

Get this?

I highly recommend this game for fans of tactical games. The game forces you to keep making your battle brothers more efficient after every battle. The art style is not only gorgeous but also functional. It looks simple yet detailed enough that even after playing for a long time it doesn't get stale watching them act.

One of my favorite parts is that you can customize the name and face of each battle brother. So you can set it as an adventure with your friends, or a walking boy band. Even the design of the different armors looks great as you can see what each person has equipped giving a better sense of immersion.

I bought the supporters edition since the developers are active and communicate well with the fans. These kind of developers deserve the support since they're also survivors of the Steam early access system.

Battle Brothers, unfortunately, allows you to start with a full complement of 12 members and punishes you if you don't do this (there seems to be no scaling of opponents based on your squad size). On top of this, you begin with so few hit points you're literally expecting troops to die at a time you cannot afford to replace them, because you are reliant on RNG when beginning instead of skill.

71,31458531,english,"Buy BB if you like: 

- Turn-based combat games such as Blood Bowl, XCOM, Mordheim,
- Randomly-generated reactive world maps to explore like in Mount & Blade.
- Character progression and the chance for permanent afflictions like in Darkest Dungeon, Mordheim, BB2. 
- Team morale and character quirkiness such as Dwarf Fortress and Rimworld 
 

For those curious about the tactical combat, the best way I can describe the depth is:

First time through, nothing worked. My guys were getting slaughtered and I had no idea why. 

Second: I figured out that some melee weapons can attack two squares. I start playing with a heavy front line holding shields, with pitchforks or polearms in the second line. This works well, so I give my front line guys all swords so they can shield wall AND riposte. Sadly, I learn they run out of fatigue very quickly when I do that. And even worse, I'm completely ineffective against anyone with a shield. 

Third: I build a front line with shields and axes, 'cause I'm all about breaking shields. This works great! Well, against brigands at least. My back line of archers, crossbowmen and pitchforks can't do much against undead. And greenskins....I can't even fight them. I make it to the noble war and realize how bad it is to fight enemies in full plate when you have nothing but axes and pokey backline weapons....

Fourth: I'm gonna win a noble war, damnit! My front line focuses on hammers, and military picks are the weapon of choice. I mix an archer, 2 crossbowmen, a pike, and two axemen in the backline. This works great for the nobles war, but undead are tough and greenskins are so bad I can't win a fight against them.

Fifth: Three crossbowmen, two pike, and an axemen in the back line. Front line is all shields and spears, for spear wall. I give all my frontline guys quick hands, and equip them with an extra  shield and give each a different secondary weapon: Axe, Hammer, Mace, Sword. My spearwall really shuts down the greenskin charge/stun attacks, and after trying a variety of different formations, I'm able to effectively take them out. Undead still give me trouble since pokey things are worthless against them....

I'm sure that as I keep playing, I'll eventually figure out that I need a good mix of weapon types to be effective. I mostly run with a flat 12 man roster with no reserves, mainly because I have trouble enough paying the daily salary as it is. I suspect i'll also learn that I really need to have several bros in reserve, so I can swap them in for different situations, as it's probably pretty tough to build a single 12 man roster that can fight humans, undead, greenskins, and direwolves/nazguls.

This is all just the depth of the tactical battle side of the game. You also need to balance stats, like fatigue vs initiative vs armor vs mobility. In fact, fatigue and armor degradation are super important. It's not a question of IF you'll run out of fatigue, it's a question of WHEN. Sure, you can have a guy with amazing armor wade into a bunch of enemies without fear. But unless he's built properly, he's going to be unable to raise his shield in a few turns. And while he might take round after round of hits without losing a single hit point, all of sudden his armor is going to finally give out and.. POP...he goes from full health to dead in one hit.

If you like tactical turn-based games with character progression, you should defintely give BB a shot.",1493541447,1493636801,True,2,0,0.519999980926513672,0,True,False,False,76561197994183794,307,12,31262,0,16630,1597024344,,

75,31465646,english,"TL:DR - If you love turn based strategy, this is the game for you.  And it has MASSIVE potential to grow.  Purchase this game, play this game, you will be very pleased. 

Now, for the full review (possibly will update after I finish my playthrough)

Not only is this game incredible in its current form, but the POTENTIAL for what it could become is wonderful.  The devs clearly thought this game through, the writers are passionate and have done well mixing creativity with procedural generation in terms of character background, storyline, etc.  But this framework could be applied to so many settings... high fantasy, historical, satirical, anime, etc etc.  

It's like Final Fantasy Tactics, meets Darkest Dungeon.  And the soundtrack?  AMAZING.  I hum it in the freakin' shower. 

I understand the desire on the part of the devs to -not- allow for base building because we're a wandering band of mercenaries, but it could be late game... a place for your original companions to kick back while the men they have trained and bled with earn a fortune for the company.  (FOR THE COMPANY! ;) )  It could add such depth to the game, and I know I'm not the only one who thinks so.

Enabling the player to interact with other merc groups on the road, or having dialogue after you save a random caravan on the road from a group of direwolves or brigands would be excellent.  Perhaps they didn't appreciate your intervention, and you have saved them only to have them turn on you?  The possiblities are many.

Battle sisters are a no brainer, absolutely need them, even if it's only a skin.

Personally, I assign ranks to my men.  From Rookie all the way to General.  So while Gen. Humbert Locksley is pelting orcs with his crossbow, Rk. Ivar Mortensen is plunging his pike into the eyeball of a Goblin rider.  It all adds flavor to the story building up in my imagination during a playthrough.

I have sunk a lot of hours into this already, and given that I run a small business and am renovating my home, that's saying a lot :)  And ya know what?  I couldn't be more pleased. 

Thank you devs... I could write so much more, but the council of Eisenberg grows impatient for the heads of their foes...",1493564539,1493564539,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197991694343,658,4,21975,303,5739,1601673677,,
76,31443547,english,"I love this game so much I decided to write my first review ever... With almost 200 hours and counting I have to say the game is addictive and since I bought Battle Brothers I can't play any other games, they just don't seem to keep me interested. Starting with battle isle long time ago I always loved turn based hex strategy games. This one delivers a lot of tactical combat, with range of skills that are connected to the weapon your men use. Game is hard but rewarding. As your men gain experience and better equipment they become powerful. Enemies who would rip them apart in early game are just a meat to hack and slash... if you play smart. If you don't, you will end up losing your men. 

I promise you, you will have your favorites. Some guys will be the core of your mercenary team. They will be your damage dealers with two handed swords, axes or hammers and you will send them to the front or flanks, so they might decapitate multiple enemies at once... and few turns later you will be swearing loud and brainstorming how to save them from certain death...

Couple advices: 
1: Few guys with shield and spear can save you from swarms of ""stupid"" enemies. Zombies and beasts will kill themselves on your spear wall. ""Smart"" enemies won't go for that but you can learn to direct them to go where you want them to, with the right spear wall. Spears have low damage but still are useful because of that skill.
2: If you are strong enough to kill ancient legionaries, get few war scythes. Few guys armed with them can make short work of any swarm. They can hit 3 enemies at once if you set up your team properly.
3: Little stars next to your guy stats tell you if he is extra talented in that stat. That will give you more points to the stat every time he levels up. High starting value and 3 stars in melee( especially if guy has some good perks) make a great mercenary.

I have only few archers in my team. In late game I prefer 2-handed weapons, especially swords as they can hit 2 enemies in line or 3 around. Great axes can hit more enemies at once but the problem is you have to stand away from your guys or you will hit them too. Hammers are good in destroying armor, 2-handed hammer can hit 3 enemies like 2-handed sword. War scythes are great second line weapon. With long axe you can destroy shields from the second line. 

If you don't play ironman mode, save your game often. Game auto saves before every combat so if something goes really bad for you, you can try again. You will notice that terrain in battle mode will be different each time, so if you really want you could chose one more favorable for you. You can also change your team setup after loading from auto save.
I didn't play ironman mode yet (no manual save). I believe its very hard. With ability to save you can check stats of men to hire and hire only those with better stats. And replay battles. On ironman you have to go through a lot of men to get highly talented group. And you will lose your best guys eventually. 

Buy this game and have fun.

94,31317710,english,"Battle Brothers (BB) is a breath of fresh air in the party-based tactical genre. The realistic underlying game systems (in and out of battle) are combined with a plethora of random events. The latter luckily spice up the long grindy sandbox experience of your wrecking crew travelling around the big world map in real-time. Completing missions and pursuing roving bands of enemies is the advised working method here and they all usually end up in a turn-based encounter. The low-magic German Medieval setting works out great and is a superb alternative to Jagged Alliance 2’s ‘80s action movies Arulco or the sci-fi doom of X-Com. Small events emphasise the grim feeling on top of the ruthless battles although there is place for a smile as well. It’s mostly communicated to the player through text that is thoughtful and well written. Eventually you’ll work your way up towards a comprehensive end-game crisis (or more if you survive the first, or none if you choose to at the start options but that makes you miss out on a lot). Getting better and tackling the various ends of the world are the only things one could label as real goals in the game. The rest of the story is up to you, the freedom to handle this can be a bit overwhelming with all those different cities in a huge world. 

The heart of BB is of course the turn-based combat against brigands, Orcs, undead skeleton rabble and euh... much, much worse. If you think you’ve seen it all there’s always something new around the corner when you’re brave enough to venture deep into the undiscovered world parts. Some Steam reviewers apparently never got past a Necromancer as the most special kind of foe, they’re in for a hell of a surprise later on. Medieval fights are no tender and merciful affairs; you can inflict many severe injuries on the enemy but this works in the opposite way as well. With elevations, a handful of different terrains, lots of different gear to loot and night/day time differences there is always something to adapt to before and during a battle. You can see through some the AI’s tactics after a certain time but overall opponents are doing the logical thing while still retaining their own style (e.g. Orc warriors don't attack like Undead legions). 

This is a management game too, several sophisticated choices are available to assemble a great team of hirelings to go against the odds in these harsh times. The beginning of your merry band is definitely quite bleak and challenging. You’re more a bunch of “zeros” with (sometimes) the potential to acquire the status of true heroes. Acquiring new brothers-in-arms is possible in the cities (or through special events) but their full statistics aren’t shown beforehand. If you want to powergame you way through, be prepared for a whole lot of save-scumming. After several hours of play you will have determined what roles you want a specific mercenary to fulfill. Recruits all have a background that contribute to an envisioned role; hunters are excellent archers and butchers know how to handle a cleaver for example. The backgrounds don’t define everything but they can definitely add a nice flavour to your game through the aforementioned events. Tip: get as many different backgrounds as possible in your team, it will pay off. By the time you know every tidbit of the underlying statistics you’ve probably restarted the game multiple times, just like with other party-based tactical games. Unfortunately not all systems and stats are explained in a clear way so it’s not a shame to grab a good guide while playing. 

The biggest compliment I can give Battle Brothers is that, as it is now, it’s very enjoyable and unforgiving at the same time while also having incredibly much potential for future addons. More events, more monsters, in-door locations and more diverse battlefields… this could grow really big. Yes, BB doesn’t have the visual flash and whistles of XCOM 2 but the art style is charming and appropriate for the cutthroat dealings you’ll experience. Seeing attack impacts and chopped heads flying through the air remains very satisfying (if you’re not at the receiving end that is). The extreme depth of Jagged Alliance 2 (with the 1.13 patch) isn’t present here but that’s not really a sin (which game does come close to that?), especially not with the means this indie game has been conceived. 

Given that fact, it’s remarkable how much the developers listen to community concerns and add more options for some of the critical issues, not just during the Early Access phase but now since release as well. The feeling that this game could have been even better or bigger isn’t a slight towards Overhype Studios as that is quickly forgotten once you realise this is already a very solid start with enough different tactics and foes to adjust your strategy to. 

[b]Anyone who loves this genre owe it to the developers that BB doesn’t get overlooked.[/b] It doesn’t seem that cheap perhaps but you will get your money out of it. I know for certain that I would voluntarily suffer many heavy injuries if that would somehow make an expansion possible. :)",1492946725,1493236260,True,4,0,0.491803258657455444,0,True,False,False,76561197970357958,492,4,13460,0,5238,1599319533,,
95,31380720,english,"Battle Brothers is a game I've always wanted since I started playing Xcom. Medieval tactical game play done well. At it's core Battle Brothers is a low fantasy setting based around Germanic mythos and set in Medeival world. The game is essentially your attempt at running a mercenary company without having every one of your men torn apart by Direwolves, swallowed whole by ghouls, hacked to bits by Brigands, chomped on by Zombies and slaughted by Greenskins.

Like Xcom, Battle Brothers is unforgiving and relentless. Your men will die. You will lose. Your hopes and dreams will be crushed, and if you're into that sort of thing, you'll love every second of it. Battle Brothers excels at providing a solid game play experience that is simple, yet addictive. The art style is pleasing and the music is surprisingly catchy without becoming to repetive, even if the music is very samey. By far and large, Battle Brothers excels at its managing components, whether it be money, food or supplies to repair equipment.

However, there are two major flaws I find with the game. The first is: some times the game can be TOO punishing. If you don't dedicate time to understanding the game mechanics and min/maxing your recruits, you'll be punished once the late game rolls around. This is particularly frustrating, because once that point hits you could be in serious trouble. And this leads into my second complaint. Whether its management or tactical, Battle Brothers gives you few resources to help turn the odds in your favour. The battles in particular suffer this problem. A few bad rolls of the RNG can leave your company devestated. Once a situation turns on you, you have few means of turning it back. This is glaringly apparent when compared to a game like Xcom that allows you to, given skill and a little luck, turn bad situations around. Xcom rewards player skill and knowledge. In Battle Brothers, once the lines have clashed, only luck can save you if things turn sour.

I think the above could be mitigated if the late game wasn't on a Doom Clock that comes a lot faster than you expect or realize.

However, overall, Battle Brothers is a good game. It's flawed, but enjoyable. I hope the devs continue their hardwork and make this the best game they possibly can. Overall it's a 65/100 for me. Solid concept, addictive, but flawed with some less than ideal mechanics.",1493232139,1493232139,True,1,0,0.500548839569091797,0,True,False,False,76561198048041607,102,5,17469,2,7361,1601463585,,

* Devious AI that plays to win
* A brutal injury and death system that feels authentic and gritty
* A high-level strategic money-management game that requires some tough choices
* Morale effects that actually matter and can quickly change the outcome of an engagement
* Beautiful yet horrifying narrative in a sparse format (that you can mostly ignore if you're in a hurry)
* Very little hand-holding and a respect for your intelligence
* A grim, mature moral outlook that only occasionally goes too far over the top
* The ability to see your veteran fighters get slowly covered in disfiguring scars until they are limping scab-covered husks
* War dogs

Against that, there are some obvious complaints:
* Only a few enemy types, all of which are the ""horde of humanoids on foot"" sort (aside from a few mounted goblins)
* No visible structures on map, even when you're supposedly assaulting some huge orc citadel
* No underground missions, even when you're supposedly entering an ancient crypt
* Limited ability to rebuild after your party is wiped-out by a horrifying near-TPK
* Sub-par to non-existent rewards for clearing out lairs
* Not enough heater shields

[b]Pros[/b]
[*]Strikes a great balance between turn-based tactical combat, man management, inventory management, trade and strategic decision making
[*]An excellent array of weaponry which open up differing tactics with very few if any ""dud"" weapons. Both weapon and skill trees for characters are well designed. I'm coming up to 100+ hours recorded and more unrecorded and I find myself experimenting with tactics and skill match ups. 
[*]Late game crises and loss of men will force you to adapt your play style.
[*]Incredibly immersive world creation, the text is tight with humour as dark as the fens you end up getting slaughtered in. You'll pick roles suited to your men's strengths, have favourites, have troublemakers and try to navigate it as best as you can.
[*]Highly recommended for experienced gamers looking for a challenge. Jump in at Veteran. You'll be fine. 

[b]Cons[/b]
[*]A couple of persistent bugs around autosaving chewing up resources, some traits not consistently applying. Remains unclear how long the team can continue to support development.
[*]Not for people who are easily frustrated.

แบทเทิล บราเธอร์ ยอดเกมวางแผนสุดยาก

ใครเกลียดการดูแลรายละเอียด กะเล่นเอามัน ไล่ฆ่าศัตรูอย่างเดียว ไม่แนะนำให้เล่น เพราะเกมจะกระซวกกองร้อยของคุณจนไส้ไหล หัวปลิว พิกลพิการจนเหี้ยน

ระบบเกมยาก แต่ไม่ได้เอาเปรียบเอาเรา กลับกันมันบังคับให้เราต้องเรียนรู้ว่าอะไรควรทำ อะไรควรจะเลี่ยง

เช่น การวางลูกทีมให้ถือโล่รวมกลุ่มเป็นแนว สร้างความได้เปรียบเวลาเข้าปะทะ พลธนูอยู่ที่สูงยิงแม่นกว่า แรงกว่าปกติ หรือการเลือกอาวุธให้ได้เปรียบเวลาปะทะกับศัตรูเป็นต้น

ระบบการจัดการกองร้อยต้องดีพอประมาณ ไม่งั้นอาจหนาวจนป่วยหนัก เสบียงทัพหมด อาวุธไม่ได้รับการซ่อมแซมจนใช้งานไม่ได้ แล้วถ้าโดนซุ่มโจมตีระหว่างนั้นก็ เตรียมโหลดเกมใหม่ได้เลย

ฉากต่อสู้เป็นแบบเทิร์นเบส ผลัดกันเดิน มีกดหยุดหรอ หรือข้ามเทิร์น สำหรับการวางแผนสู้ พื้นที่ฉากรบมีการสุ่ม เช่น ความสูงต่ำของฉาก สิ่งกีดขวาง ทำให้บางครั้งก็เข้าทางเราหรือศัตรู มันเลยไม่จำเจเวลาเล่นซ้ำ แถมศัตรูฉลาด ไม่มีเดินโง่ๆเข้ามาให้เราเอาธนูยิงเล่น ใครอยากกดรอเทิร์นรอศัตรูเดินเข้ามาติดกับดัก บอกได้เลยว่ามีน้อยครั้งมากจนนับได้

อ้อ ลูกทีมของเราตายแล้วตายเลย(Permadeath) แต่เกมก็เตือนเราตลอดว่าการเป็นทหารรับจ้าง การโดนฆ่าตาย เป็นเงื่อนไขของงานอยู่แล้ว แห่ม........ จะโหดไปไหน

ข้อเสียของเกมที่เห็น คือ ไม่มีเสียงพากษ์เลย อ่านตัวหนังสือเอาลูกเดียว อาจจะรำคาญช่วงแรกๆ แต่เพลงประกอบเพราะมาก ไพเราะเวอร์ๆ จนทำให้ความเจ็บปวดตอนอ่านนานๆ คลายลงไปได้พอสมควร

27,31249469,english,"People said this was like Mountain Blade crossed with XCOM, they were right.

I was initially put off by the character sprites being torso only, in game though, with the music, sound effects, in depth turn based combat mechanics and minor but easily readable animations the visuals meld into the wider game to the point where I'm not sure how much would be gained with a style similar to XCOM's fully 3d modelled troops.

Stats and level-ups determine how well a brother battles, but other than having a separate skill for melee and one for ranged the options a brother has available are dependant on the weapon in his hands (and any spares you might give them to swap to, but you don't want to weight them down too much!).

The talent trees and skills are very well thought out. There are always tough choices to make and no skills or talents feel like ""traps"". All the weapons are expertly balanced between damage, armour pen, reach, action point cost, and many other properties that make looting new gear a rewarding experience.

To top it all off the game doesn't pull any punches. Small mistakes lead to dead men and you need to know when to walk away. 

The campaign map, like the combat, has a bit of a learning curve with regards to how distance, trade, reputation, faction, and settlement type can effect your opportunities as a mercenary company. Once you get the hang of it though the endless map options via procedural generation and being able to share map seeds adds a ton of replayability and also serves as an added difficulty modifier. (Maps with an early source of salt, dyes, or gems to trade can give an early gold boost, and enemy difficulty is based on renown and levels, so better gear can help a lot)

The closest game I have to compare it to would be Mount, and Blade but with horses being far too costly for even the Royal famlies to dream about sending to war along with just a trickle of foul magics leaked into the world. Combat is pretty darn brutal so unless you save scum expect to see your men get cut down with some of the utter ease you inflict on the bandit, greenskin, and undead scum of the world even with a set of heavy armor. However the dark stories you could tell of Bogart the Brave at last meeting his maker at a lucky shot of a fear stricken monster, or man after the same warrior killed all his kin more than makes up for that long as it happens in limited doses.

43,25693033,english,"Should I recommend this game? The game provides a tactical battle system which is good, nothing exceptional, but challenging and enjoybale if you can overcome the frustrating moments the devs like to throw at you abundantly. It is RNG based, so if you don't like randomness and luck heavily influencing combat outcome you should stay away from the game. Nevertheless even the tactical battles, which together with the party management is the core of the game have major weak aspects: The AI is average, the challange mostly doesn't come from the AI smartness but from being outnumbered and unfortunately from the results of the random map generation: Any deployment phase absent, you may get heavily disadvantaged by just how the algorithm randomly places the units: Enemy marksmen placed on high ground which combined with high initiative and high hit chance results in units immediately being hit and often injured, goblin wolfriders with high initiative and high mopvement range which immediately close to one of your units randomly placed on a weak spot being surrounded and literally destoyed. All this happens at combat start, without the player able to do anything. This is extremly bad game design, in my opinion. While it is true, that the map generation randomness may disadvantage the AI as well, a flaw does not compensate another flaw. Combat heavily dependent on the random map generation without initial player interaction is a major game design flaw. Some may say that the (experienced) player can counter this by developping the characters accordingly. While this is true to some extent, it is not viable early game. Apart from the fact that I consider assigning traits just to counter a major design flaw not really an acceptable solution, early game you simply cannot do it, gaining a level takes relatively long and some traity are not accessible early.
The campaign game exists only to link the battles together, as in other sandbox games like Mount & Blade. Unfortunately the campaign gameplay is highly repetitive, there is only a very limited set of quests and events which you do again and again, often you get the same quest offered in a row. Essentially it is a wander simulation, you often get a quest in a town taking place at the other end of the map so you have to constantly wander it up and down. It takes just too long and though the 2D map is not really horrible, having to spend one's time on that same map for hours to do a quest, is something you at some point really really tired of.
The final part of the game is the party management and character development. Well I consider that last part, the character development the worst part of the game. There is very little which makes sense because of the out of control randomness heavily determining what you get: skill points, traits, talents. What determines a character often contradicts itself: Just an example, you may get an expensive professional soldier with a high melee stat having an hidden talent for ranged attack and additionally a high resolve stat combined with a trait diminishing it. Though I principally like character development not solely being determined by player input and having some degree of randomness, the results should make sense. So as it is implemented, it greatly ruins the game experience. 
So, in a a word, Battle Brothers is as for the tactical battles a challenging and enjoyable experience, created by a small indie team I'm thankful for their work and ready to continue to support them. But this game is by far not perfect, not a great game, and calling it a masterpiece as some do is totally out of place.

And in these towns you will find taverns to get rumors, to drink with your company of sellsword brothers, you will find armor crafters, weapon crafters, booming markets and very empty and poor markets (when raided for example) with their own local economies, influeced by supply and demand, and...of course, by local brigands, goblins, or worse... Very often you will find contracts in these towns to slay these very threats. All in all, worth a buy if you are looking for your own personal adventure in a raw, feudal medieval word with a Game of Throne-ish feel with all the houses and folks you meet everywhere, all with their own backgrounds. 9/10

Pros:
+ Great turn based combat
+ Great gear and leveling/talent system
+ Straight forwardness, everything from money, utilities, gear etc, it's all imediately self-explanatory
+ Right balance and amount of micro-management
+ ""Real-time""  word map with time-rations-health in the rigth phase, speed and place
+ Great random RPG elements with fun and realistic decision making
+ Breathing living world to play in with it's own local threats, economies and men looking for coin
+ Unique fitting and thematic art-style. (My personal favorite, it's very character full and really put's the right ambiance in the game.)

Cons:
- Repeative core principle (go to town, re-supply/upgrade/level/repair/heal -> go ""quest"" -> repeat), but random RPG elements and your warband's ambitions may stir this up every now and then.
- Can be frustrating to loose some of your top-leveled, top geared men, but that's part of the job (and game ;-) )
- Takes a while to discover all the types of gear, perks, stats and more specifically, the optimal combinations, especially due to markets and workshops being quite ""random"", but I guess that has it's chamrs aswell and makes you ""go out there""

All in all, I do very much enjoy playing this game and is well worth the bucks. Its a unique game and everything feels ""just right"" and makes for a fun, though be it somewhat repeatative, game. The RPG elements and constantly checking your men and outfit and then find combat and reward makes for a game you'll soon learn to have spend lots of hours in once started. 9/10

54,31138115,english,"tl;dr: The game is just one endless grind to pay for replacement men and equipment, until your company eventually collapses and you lose.

Long Version:

The game describes itself as a tactical RPG. Forget the RPG part. In fact, playing this game as an RPG will get your men killed and you will lose. 

Instead, this game could be described as a statistical simulator. Because that's what it all boils down to. Are your stats better than the enemies you're facing? I'm not kidding. People have published reams of spreadsheets on this game, because if you don't optimise your stats, your men will die and you will lose.

You're in charge of a mercenary company and it's up to you to decide who to hire, what to equip, and what contracts to take. But if you're not careful with your decisions, your men will die and you will lose.

When you hire someone, erase their name and rename them according to their role. Remember the part about ignoring the RPG aspect of this game? Suppose you hire Kurt the Farmer, who is down on his luck after watching his farm get destroyed by raiders. He also happens to have high HP and defense. Erase his identity and rename him ""Tank #1"", so you know his role when you click on him on the battlefield. Is Godfrey the Brawler excellent with damage? Good. Call him ""DPS #1"". Does Burton the Juggler have high initiative and resolve? Rename him ""Sergeant #1"". And so on and on. Because if you don't, and you forget the roles of each character, your men will die and you will lose. 

Don't bother in creating a flavoured company, like a company of pikemen, or a company of rangers. The RPG part is non-existent, remember? The devs made the decision that certain foes can only be defeated with certain tactics, and nothing else. For example, zombies are best killed by decapitating them with cleavers. Try any other tactic, they will re-animate, your men will die and you will lose. 

Dying in this game wouldn't be so much of a problem if hiring replacements was easier. Unfortunately, contracts tend to pay such little gold that you're often caught in a death spiral, unable to purchase new men, tools, food or equipment with the little gold that you're rewarded. Eventually all your men will die from attrition and you will lose. 

The problem with this game is that a few deaths within your company can be catastrophic, especially during the early stages of the game when you have no gold or equipment. Turtling up and only accepting the easiest contracts is not an option as contracts pay little gold and you're faced with daily wages and food consumption. The devs have made that you MUST take on riskier contracts, or go bankrupt and run out of food, and watch your men die and lose the game. 

Other games like Rimworld are reknown for their brutality, and yet they are still fun. It's because they are recoverable from catastrophic disasters. In Battle Brothers though, if you're caught in a death spiral, there is no recovery. If you can't pay your men, they leave. Or you can let them die and lose the game. 

Ultimately, this game is not fun. Roleplaying is minimal. Yes, it is challenging, but in a statistical spreadsheet sort of way.

60,30925187,english,"TL:DR simple on the surface, deep underneath, try it! (Edited for more knowledge)

Some games promise the world, but when you play them they don't deliver. Other games sound like a convoluted mish-mash of ideas and mechanisms and are worth gold. This one is in between. The key is: ONE MORE FIGHT! I can't put this game down, it is excellent in its main mechanic - the turn-based strategy gem that is each battle. It took me 25 hours NOT to be frustrated. Now I am no longer frustrated and infinitely more intrigued. Tips at the bottom of the review:

Bring together your merry band of brothers and see them slain by your underestimation of an opponent, or indeed because you are stupid. But slain they shall be! The main mechanic of the game, a classic turn based RPG battle, is very strong - if you don't have the right assembly of types you will probably regret it. My last game I realised that shield-walls are pretty strong, but all my men had swords/falchions and we suffered because of our lack of range (arrow/polearms). I tried to mix it up, but realised I had no good archers so I stuck two guys in with polearms and javelins. The idea was there, the enemy wasn't. After a gruelling battle with 10 of my men versus 14 undead I ended up with three man, wounded and running for their lives. 

Harsh as I was pretty much destitute due to kitting all the fellas out. I also  hadn't paid enough attention to two very crucial systems: Fatigue - each element in the battle, whether it is wearing armour or attacking, costs energy points. Even though my intended hedgehog shieldwall strategy seemed solid early on, I ended up with tired men who could only attack sparsely, result: Lots of death. The other system is upgrading: it is tempting to upgrade your squad all the time it is available, giving them more skills and so on, but be wary - each upgraded dude is going to want more money per day... Add this to the need to constantly repairing weapons and healing injuries (in the form of buying tools and medicine at markets) and you have a recipe for a downward spiral. 

Try to stay as a small close-knit group, decide which guys are the core (and upgrade them) and add 'cannon fodder'. It might be cruel to send Simon the fisherman into battle with nothing but a wooden stick, but that is his job and you pay him a handsome 5 gold a day for the pleasure. 

I definitely haven't got the brilliant approach to this game yet, but that means it keeps calling me: ONE MORE TURN! ONE MORE TURN!

Try it, you won't be disappointed.

Top tips: 

Bring enough men at all times. Your main fighting component is a dozen, but having back-ups for that dozen really helps. Even if it is just a dude with a knife. 

Camp at night. Sounds obvious because it is. Your fighting at night is more messy, avoid it if you can.

Fight in your designated spot: Forests and mountains are a pain to fight in, if you can, get your opponent out to a nice flat battlefield.

Get a friend: Pick a village you like the look of, take their contracts. Having an allied village means better prices at the market and better contracts long term. 

Know your enemy! Try to scout your enemy before picking the fight (especially non-contract fights) if unsure and in low power (below a dozen active fighting men) avoid the fight. Different types of civ *man, orc, goblin, animal* have different ways of fighting. Once you worked them out, prepare your line-up for each one.",1491233922,1492112645,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197973785684,376,28,11622,0,2948,1599653954,,

62,30788135,english,"After watching a let's play for a while and trying this game again I changed my opinion. The game delivers what it promises: leading a mercenary company from battle to battle killing bandites, skeletons, and such, and fulfilling contracts. The difficulty is quite high but for a first play through easy mode is a fair challenge. Somehow I still have the feeling that there is not much content and depth in some respect, but the content which is there is well implemented. One highlight is the enemy AI. Battles are really quite interesting: different enemies have different tactics, skills/weapons/terrain play make a difference, and the AI really plays quite smart. A downside is the amount of randomness you can encounter. For example in my first quick game all battles I saw where on completely flat and open terrain, while in a second attempt there was much more variety right on the second map. And why does that dude miss a 60% shot three times in a row? Oh my.. So overall I think this is worth a try if you are into slightly masochistic games and you have a good relationship with RNG.

I can't really understand the positive reviews for this game. Don't pay $30 or even $50 -- this game is worth at most an indy game price. The gameplay is pretty shallow for an niche game. It's also all about fighting. I know that's what it says in the feature list, but when you look at the procedurally generated world map it feels like so much is missing. Where is for example trade or diplomacy? Why can I not interact with these little buildings on the map? The battle maps are not very varied either, all the same a little bit of elevation and a tree here and there. Overall this game lacks in almost everything. There are so many other titles, most of them alreay a couple of years old, which are cheaper and better.

Also, probably watch some of your men get brutally murdered in the process.

Battle Brothers may be brutal, and it may be a grind, but it is also very fun and very addicting. The difficulty and high stakes of permadeath just make any progress you may earn that much more gratifying. The combat itself is great, and any fan of strategic turn-based combat should enjoy it quite a bit; battles require thought and planning, and even then you are always one step away from disaster. Managing your crew of soldiers is a joy for those who like to do a bit of micro-managing and strategizing. Little touches, such as the interesting and humorous character backgrounds and distinctive art of the characters, add a lot of color and personality to the game.  It all comes together extremely well, forming a very distinctive and charming (in a brutally violent kind of way) gameworld. It’s very easy to lose hours upon hours to Battle Brothers without even realizing it.

At the core is a turn based tactical battle game, where your squad of mercenaries has to battle wolves, goblins, orcs, brigands etc; the ruleset is pretty simple (albeit not very well documented) and offers you several possibilities for customization (so, the typical easy to learn, hard to master gameplay).

When you are not in battle, you are roaming the random generated map in search for contracts, points of interest or good trade deals. The world is a live entity (think at Sid Meier's Pirates, but on land)  where cities can spawn caravans directed to other cities; you can ambush them if you want, but if you leave them reach the destination, then you can eventually watch the town grow. It's a nice system but I believe it's a bit simplicistic, I wish the simulation would be more ""vibrant"".

This game has a lot to offer, the sandbox approach works well, but it amplifies the main issue of Battle Brothers: repetitiveness. Eventually you'll start asking yourself what's the point of all this loop (roam to city, accept contract, reach destination, battle, go back for payment); however the game is very challenging, so this is one of those few cases where repetitiveness doesn't lead to boredom.

94,31006046,english,"This game is difficult to recommend because in it's current state, the game is more of a 👌 than a 👍 or 👎.

Don't get me wrong - the graphic style is great, sound isn't bad, and the polish is there.  The rogue-type aspects (supplies, RNG, etc.) of this game are what kept me wanting to come back for more, but that's just it, there wasn't much more to be had.

When I saw the previews with undead and other fantasy elements mixed into a tactical game, I was sold, thinking it could turn out like a newer version of Ogre Battle.  Except your little mercenary band can't recruit anyone other than humans, and there isn't any magic element outside of Necromancers (who you can't recruit) raising undead.  Women aren't recruitable either, so no Briane of Tarth's or Valkyrie-types.  You're just a bunch of [battle] bros with some weapons.

Which brings me to the next part - the tactics, or the limited amount thereof.  There's essentially two strategies.  70% of the battles are just turtling up from the start, while the enemy wave breaks against your spear wall, inter-parsed with axes for breaking shields.  For the other 30%, when the enemy doesn't rush to it's own death and has ranged units, you either attack at night or slowly march forward with shields up.  That's it.  

There are no area attacks that penalizes shield turtling (like grenades or fireballs) and the guys who can do the two-handed melee area attacks get mowed down like grass for not having a shield.  You have a huge amount of weapons to choose from, which is nice, but you basically equip every other guy with a spear or crossbow.

The fatigue system is about as interesting as every battle devolving into a tired slog, unless your characters have that one perk that lets you restore half your fatigue.  Since that perk is available at lvl 2, you pretty much give it to everyone.  [i]Everyone.[/i] Because of the RNG rogue-like aspects, there are a couple other perks that are impossible to survive long without, so the entire perk tree is pretty unbalanced and uninteresting.

The random encounters are few but redeeming.  The quests (contracts) are either fetch/kill the things at some location or escort missions.  Noble contracts are a little more interesting but are still ""kill the things in this area"".

Overall it's kind of a grind to get to late game, since you pretty much repeat the same two strategies each battle.  The character traits are interesting, and the wound affects & fatigue mechanics add [i]some[/i] depth to the game, but the repetitive nature of the quests/battles just is not that fun.  I would have loved to be able to rescue and recruit a wyvern that spews fire, but maybe my expectations are too high.

10,30968015,english,"[h1]Summary[/h1]
This is one of the best games I played this year and I can fully recommend it to anyone who likes strategy games. World is harsh and brutal, mistakes cost a lot, and losing is fun. It's tough and challenging but rewarding like few others. Creating your own Company of Battle Brothers and leading them to fame, guts, and eventually glory feels great. 

[h1]AI[/h1]
I never expected something as good as what ""Battle Brothers"" delivers. AI is simply superb. It makes correct decisions on the battlefield - uses terrain well, protects its archers, and prioritizes targets well. Archers, for example, will attack your archers as their priority - that makes sense as range weapons can be quite deadly and real-world artillery does it too with counter-battery fire. 

Beasts on the other hand show less sophistication and might behave strangely sometimes. That seems perfectly justified and makes every battle different to a degree. 

[h1]The World[/h1]

Procedurally generated worlds are great, but maybe a bit too small. I would love them to have more villages and to be able to visit places that are only mentioned - like herbalists or hunters and to do some quests for them. Other than that the world is quite rich and believable but dialogues can get a bit repetitive after a while. Overall, the replayability value is very good here. 

There are many accurate weapons and armors. Weapons especially are believable and varied. Battle pick will be great for breaking armor while falx will chop heads quite efficiently. Both are accurate and make perfect sense. 

Quests are nice and there are many of them, with some variations and twists (some allow you to betray your employer and there's even an achievement for doing that). 

There are many different enemies and facing Nachzehrers is really a challenge, especially since you can encounter them quite early and they can literally eat your brothers and ask for seconds. Greenskins are challenging too and ancient legionaries based on their Roman counterparts can be a good source of armor and weapons in the early game and a nice challenge later. Fighting necromancers is especially fun - not only your fallen enemies will reanimate, but your dead brothers will too, and killing the mage must be your top priority here. 

There are no excuses here. Git gud or die. 

[h1]Is it perfect?[/h1]
No game is, but this one certainly does what it's supposed to very well. It's challenging but not impossible, with a rich world and a nice variety of enemies. I would definitely like larger worlds and some more settlement types and perhaps some more events depicting relationships and bond between the brothers but what we get is great enough.

13,30966204,english,"This is basically an example of an early access game that has done right by its customers and made a really solid, addictive title better and better with each update.

I personally enjoy how much variety there is in equipment that can suit a variety of strategies.  In talking to other people who play, some mix polearms with spears, others make two handed tanks, others use kite shields and counter snipers, and some stack maces to stunlocking entire enemy formations.  The game is open ended in just about every respect.

I can only think of a few negatives:  some enemies are more annoying than they probably should be.  Necrosavants are just kind of a pain that are hard to hit and teleport anywhere to do bleed damage to soft targets.  Lesson learned:  Don't have any soft targets.  But since you can't know what you're facing sometimes until you've already committed, you can kind of get fucked sometimes.

And some battle types are not fun:  Sieges have several options that can play out, but one of the most common is back to back battle against end-game units without a chance to swap out gear or men regardless of how many you have in reserve.  This basically ends in your A-team getting ground to death, which should be a simple fix.

After the end of EA I did a quick 250 day run on beginner to check if my old builds work fine with the final version (they do - with some tweaks needed now) and retired legendary with war and orc invasion resolved.

Now, what keeps me going to play for such a long time? Well, Battle Brothers is a nasty, challenging, hard and unforgiving experience on the one side. On the other it's a shiny pearl of tactical decisions, clever strategy, a little luck and the good feeling of mastering the challenges thrown upon your humble pack of mercenaries. When first encountering orc warriors I was annihilated in just a few turns. Same with goblins shooting me to oblivion. You need to learn and adapt and after a lot of defeats and scores of dead brothers you will eventually get the knack how to handle them. The feeling of accomplishment and confirmation doing the right things at the right time is very rewarding.

So, to whom shall I suggest playing BB? Well, for all the turnbased tacticians out there who don't shy from failure and a very steep learning curve, it is one of the best turnbased games in this decade. 
Players who play games for fun in the sense of easy, accessible, quick rewarding gamestyles are advised to take a look on some let's play videos, if they want to be sure, else they will get frustrated very soon.

__________________________________


Pros: 
  + Low fantasy medieval setting, right on my G-spot. 
  + realistic representation of different functions of different weapons, in a turn-based game standard ofc. 
  + Already great variety and balance of weapons as an early access. 
  + Fun (insightful) stories to immerse yourselvs into. 
  + XCOM-feel-mechanics to make you care about every one of your soldier's life and death.

Cons: 
  - Few mission types, repetitive after a while. 
  - Few things to do in game, could use more events and playability. 
  - Small map, lack of exploration. 
  - Lack of a ""myself"" character within the ranks, the first person narrator is only a background character that can't fight. 

  In general, this is a game with A LOT of potential and delivers its concept pretty well at its current stage already. The tactic system and the game mechanics in general works like a charm and the art style itself is crudely beautiful and very medieval. The battle animations, like cutting with blade and striking with warhammer, feels more ""impactful"" and realistic than even most of the true action games somehow. 
  However, the lack of content at the current stage is why its still in early access, the player have very limited things to do beside completing missions and slaughtering people. And when most of your team have grinded pretty well, there is no further depth into this game. And yes, you can only have 18 people in your warband and only 12 of them could be deployed on the battlefield (you can, however, have some 50vs50 encounters from time to time if the situation calls it, which I assume is a sign that they can expand the battle rosters in the futrure). If this game want people to play more than 100 hrs, it needs more content than this. 
  Fortunately, the dev team seems to be kept busy and updates pretty frequent. And in the current stage I feel the dev team is making great effort to make the game richer in content and have less repetitiveness. We can see incoming funtional buildings in game now and the devlog seems to have some bright insight about future add-ons, so I would say go give this a try, it is well worth your money and time even at the current stage. 

8/10

_____________________________________

Following is edited after official release
_____________________________________

The official release basically dealt with all the cons I ve had listed for this game in beta (except a ""myself"" character that could fight on the frontline, i still think that would add immersion to the game). Further more it added a lot of mechanics that I didnt even expect to have (like the ""late game events""options) In my opinion this game at its current state is more immersive and well-crafted than Darkest Dungeon and I am a big fan of DD myself. 

Anyway I plan to invest more time in this game to build a new warband (since the old beta saves are non-compatible). Strongly recommend to anyone interested in medieval battles, warband building and turn-based strategy

Overall used to be 8/10, now I give it 9.5/10 after release. Really really well done developers. (the only 10/10 I would give to this genre is XCOM, and thats more of a emotional apreciation for the classic, the fun i had on both games are equal)

37,30932667,english,"Now out of Early Access, Battle Brothers has matured into a great game. If at any point in your life you wondered what it would be like to lead your own ragtag bunch of mercenaries, then you will probably have a lot of fun playing it.

Set in a ''low fantasy'' universe, the game has a fairly realistic setting with a few supernatural and Tolkien-esque elements (necromancy, orcs, goblins, etc.). There is no overarching story per se; your main concern is to satisfy the strategic needs of your company by having enough gold, food, supplies, ammunition and medical supplies at all time, and to strenghten it by taking on contracts and buying better weapons and armor. You will start by protecting caravans and fighting off bandits for local merchants and dignitaries in order to increase your repute, until you gain the attention of the noble houses which will provide more lucrative - and far more dangerous - jobs. Survive long enough and you will have to withstand the end-game crises: either an orcish or undead invasion, or a global feud between the noble houses.

The turn-based combat is well done and takes a while to master. You will have to learn about the different weapons available and use them appropriately to create an efficient outfit. For instance, while a spear does not deal a whole lot of damage, it has the highest chance to hit of all weapons, making it the perfect weapon for your new recruits, and it allows the wielder to enter a spearwall stance that repels enemies, making it a great defensive weapons as well. 

There are three difficulty modes: Beginner, Veteran and Master. The difficulty spikes abruptly on Veteran, so start on Beginner to learn the ropes. And whatever you do, DON'T try to be a hero. This game is about running a business, and your men are the most important resource you have. Never pick a fair fight if you can avoid it. Don't hesitate to abandon contracts if it's clear you're not being paid enough to cover the risks involved (some of your patrons WILL try to buy your services at a bargain for ridiculously dangerous jobs). And fleeing from battle is always a valid option.

At 32$, you should get your money's worth if you don't mind the lack of an actual story.

- Great visuals (split shields and arrows can litter the ground, heads fly, armor gets damaged, etc.).

- People you hire have their own traits and backgrounds. It adds a bit o variety to them. I got a bit of ""Crusader Kings 2"" vibe here; with each mercenary being an entity, rather than another nameless goon whose name I don't even recall.

,then Battle Brothers is for you. 

It's a difficult game that likes to throw curveballs. There's  a lot to learn like when to avoid combat, where to trade, which missions to take, who to hire, what's good in what situation. I definitely recommend watching a let's play by someone experienced, especially if you get easily frustrated. The game teaches you the basics but basics are not enough to survive and there's much to be learned through failure. 

In terms of visuals BB has made a very effective compromise imo. While the ""chess piece"" appearance of characters may seem off puting at first you'll soon notice just how detailed things are. Every piece of equipment is shown on the characters as well as damage to both armor and flesh. If a character loses a nose he'll have a grotesque wound in the middle of his face, if they lose an eye they'll get an eye patch. The visuals may be low cost but they're very atmospheric and full of charm and character. 

The music too is far beyond what you'd expect from a low production game but you'll have to hear for yourself. Try this one for example: https://youtu.be/YwqBGabmE_E?list=PLMbw15ySmbBu2ryOh0vtNjqMFDnJLSG7S

For a game that is 90% based around the tactical turn based combat you would expect the challenge to be centered around troop placement in lineup, weapon type selection and actualy stategy in the battle...

Well while i did get outplayed by the AI a couple of times tactically (although most of them were vs situations that i wasnt fully familiar with) the challenge of this game is simply getting decent RNG.

No matter how well you execute your plan and how effective it is it's simple down to 1-2 RNG rolls to completely mess up your playthrough (specially if you are playing at Veteran+ and Ironman). I seriously cannot count the times that my ful HP  with 100% armor guy missed his 70% roll only to be critically wounded to 30% health by the guy who was suppoed to die.

Situations like 9 consecutive attackson the same round on a surrounded opponent with chances ranging from 40-60 (nighttime swamps) all fail only to have the guy who was on 1hp attack once and chop of the head of 1 of his 7 attackers.

Total Review Score: 8/10

Pros: 
+ Highly addictive, 
+ excellent sound effects increase immersion, 
+ visceral battles, 
+ funny events

Cons: 
- Disastrous world creation can last 60 minutes, 
- dodgy game balancing not so fun without my BB Total Conversion on Expert Ironman

Developer Support: 10/10
Exemplary support from the developers. They fix bugs as we report them.

Audio: 10/10
Movie-quality soundtrack that fits this medieval gritty game. Developers were lucky to find such amazing musicians. Excellent sound effects are aplenty and help create gritty world feel. 

Art Direction: 10/10
Harmonic color choices prominent in the game world and on the beautiful menu. High quality, awe inspiring paintings and nicely matching 2D props art! 

Graphics: 10/10
For an indie game with limited funds and manpower the graphics of the Battlescape, the map, cities, GUI is appears made with love. Artist pays attention to little details, like swords becoming bloody when hitting enemy and characters wounds become visible, everything looks extremely detailed!!

Story: 8/10 
After destroying the largest evil ancient structure there little remains that would bring me back to witness never before seen siege units of the orcs, etc..  Maybe if there were large monsters quests, like Hydra, Dragon, etc...  Maybe in some future DLC, but unlikely. :)

Gameplay: 8/10
Excellent game design, but balancing is a bit dodgy: Best items - armor, weapons -  usually pop up in the shop at or after game begin, when the player doesn't have the money and these items disappear later. Same with hedge knights being there at game begin, but mysteriously disappear later.
Redesigning or modding the game and playing the result is much more fun than the plain vanilla experience. 
After my Total Conversion the gameplay becomes 10/10 on Expert Ironman difficulty:  previous parties left their legendary or named items in a cache, which the new party finds and equips.
Named items are transferred from previous parties, especially the super rare named bows, action points 3x increase, levelup bonus increase 01..02 values become 05, adding perks after level 11, adding some beginning perks, etc..

Disastrous World Creation Algorithm: 1/10 
New world creation usually lasts 60 minutes, because the tutorial is not skippable and frequently it takes about 17 tries, until a satisfactory world is created without these ugly results chronicled in this gallery:

56,30908367,english,"I highly recommend the game Battle Brothers.

I love the gritty and realistic approach to a medival fantasy setting akin to the works of George RR Martin's Game of Thrones. It gives such an amazing atmoshere and gives the super-natural elements of the game such as other races (orks and goblins) and the undead and very threatening atmosthere that I have rarely seen in a fantasy setting.

The gameplay is solid satsifiing from the very well drawn visuals to the sickening sounds of the crunching of bones and the stabbing of flesh from the combat of the game. The combat and difficulty can make the game very unforgiving which can mean for a horiffic slaughter of one's mercenary company in an unexpected skirmish but can also mean such a satisfiing feeling of victory when you take on a group of orcs with minimul casualties and reap the rewards of good loot and reward money.

The soundtrack is also incredibly addictive and have had many tunes stuck in my head throughout the day. I would also recommend to anyone thinkng of buying the game to also buy the soundtrack DLC as I hope this will go to the creators of the soundtrack who I believe are a different company from the developers of the game itself. 

As a medival history and fantasy fan I would definately reconmend it and as a stratagy and RPG fan I would also definately reconmend this game.

You will definately have a blast!

-there needs to be more quest variety
-there needs to be a medic mechanic, to try and treat someone on the battlefield to potentially save dying comrades. not every time but at least the player can do something about some instakilled allies
-there needs to be more quest variety, if it stays like this, most players wont even reach a disaster since they quit around day 20-60 since these days feel exactly the same (and get boring quick)
-more quest variety or at least some other form to make money. maybe the ability to plunder settlements, right now trading is no fun for most players and the rest gets bored quickly by the quests
-we need a skill or mechanic that lets us roughly estimate potential recruits. right now i buy 10 guys, look at them and sell 9 of them. wtf. this is frustrating, wastes money, and made me quit playing ironmode alltogether since it serves no purpose other than making the game a bigger tedious money farm through the same 5 quests.

At first glance it reminded me of Banner Saga with Prison Archetect graphics. But I have to say it's far more intriguing than both those titles. You raise up your own mercenary company, hire, equip, and train your guys, design a standard, forge alliances or enemies. Adventure for gold, or to explore a hidden temple of undead.. And then face off with armies of goblins and orcs, or join a side in an epic Game of Thrones style battle of noble houses. I really love this game!

You'll get attached to your soldiers, whome you can name, customize the look of, and of course train up however you want. Their graphics show the scars of previous battles (missing nose.. ouch!) And they all have little personalities that come into play when doing missions or visiting towns (my Sellsword ""Gertrund"" tried his damndest to ruin relations between me and a settlement by constantly hitting on other mens wives...)

The soundtrack is especially great. My favorite tracks are when fighting the undead, very eerie and cool. A lot of work was put into making this game feel very atmospheric, despite the SEEMINGLY simple nature of the game.

I am one. I really liked the idea of tactical battles, I digged the minimalism, and I thought the game-loop is a fit for me.

Turns out that I was wrong on all that except that I still like the art style.

Basically, there is zero introduction to any concept in this game. There are tutorial videos you have to check out on your own, if you start a campagin you are in the game and nothing is explained, at all. Reading the other reviews, this is a Wiki game, meaning you'll have the wiki up in the background to read up on concepts the game doesn't explain.

Combat I found very frustrating. As I said, I'm a newbie so I got my ass kicked all the time. When I went to Twitch to see experienced players play the game, I quickly noticed all they do is abuse shield/spear combos or run away from battles with tougher enemies pretty much all the time. Not really tactical, that's on a level with savegame abusing for me.

The game-loop is taking contracts, fighting, hopefully not losing too much of your squad, then gearing them up a little. The problem is, that this is all the game has. This game is just a game-loop, and with how frustrating/boring that is, I decided the game is not for me and refunded.

-Unique level system

Cons:

-VERY heavy grind
-Losing one or two veterans of many battles can be very devestating and set your warband back
-VERY heavy grind
-No permanent ""buffs"" for your warband - spending hours leveling a few characters only to have them killed in 1 hit later on will cause you to have to start with a fresh character and restart the exp grind

-Items are expensive early to mid game
-Easy difficulty WAY too easy. higher difficulties seem ""too"" difficult. (Enemies hit MUCH more often, you miss a LOT more, there are many more enemies ect)

I'm going to make an allegorical comparison and argue there's a little bit of witcher thrown in there as well. Sometimes your contracts are to fight monsters, undead, and/or orcs and goblins (little bit of LOTR ambiance there, too).  Only instead of being a well-armored and trained badass who has fought their entire life, you and your men are the spongy, fragile peasants and beggars off the streets of Novigrad. It's your job to keep them alive as best you can and nit together whatever supplies and equipment you're able to until eventually you *hopefully* get them into a legitimate fighting force.

It's a gritty game that joins the genres of everything that you think is cool if you find yourself already looking at this game.

The meat of the game is in the tactical layer, there is hardly any strategic element other then managing expenses (hiring mercs, buying equipment, trading goods, etc).

If you've played Sid Meier's Pirates or Mount & Blade, you'll probably be quite familiar with how the game flows outside of combat as it uses exactly that formula of open-world exploration and travel when out of combat. You can even buy goods from one town to sell for profit in another, just like those games.

91,30854452,english,"First of all the comparisons to other games made in some of the user reviews are just absolutely ridiculous. Don't be mislead by them. Basically the game consists of the open world part and the tactical battles. 

The open world part is in my opinion underdeveloped and offers so very little that it is hardly worth mentioning, which is fine for me because I bought it for the battles. But it is important to know that, because if you are looking for RPG elements (i.e. dialogue options/politics/story line in a medieval setting) and discovery you honestly wont find it here - yet at least. It could be improved in future updates of course and there is great potential but it is just not realized yet. 

The battlesystem suffers from a couple of flaws that really hurt it badly. For example the fatigue system, which severly limits the actions your soldiers can take. There is a good selection of weapons which provide different abilities and also gadgets like throwing nets, so in theory there are many interesting options in battle. But in reality, your soldiers can only take one or two actions and even less as the battles progresses because they get fatigued. And these actions absolutely count because the game is quite challenging, so you will realize very quickly that from those many interesting options only very few are actually viable. In my opinion this is a balance issue. To illustrate what I mean here is an example: as the game progresses enemies will have increasingly heavy armor. Of all the weapons in the game only some are efficient in dealing with heavy armor. This automatically makes the other weapons less attractive. 

Also the hit chances are generally quite low and the RNG in this game is just a bitch. Obviously this is where the whole 'git gud' thing starts. I play a lot of turn-based tactical and rogue-like games, so I have a very high tolerance for RNG. But in Battle Brothers it is a problem for me, because unless you want to reload over and over and over again (which I hate and thats why I generally choose Iron Man Mode but I would never play it in this one) you will very quickly figure out and only play one specific tactic that I wont spoil here. So unlike other games, because youre options are so limited as described above, you can do very little to manage the RNG and that is why I am frustrated where as usually I am not. 

So over all the combat feels restrictive, frustrating and boring since you have to stick to very few actually viable ways of doing things. It might be better in easy mode but I doubt it. Again, great portential but not quite realized. This might be easier to fix though.

93,30843207,english,"An extremely hyped game that boils down to this:

1) Go to a settlement and accept a contract for your mercenary band (you can't have more than one active contract at a time)
2) Do what the contract says (go there and kill that, alternatively go there and take this with you)
3) Go back to the settlement where you've accepted the contract, collect your payment and sell the loot
4) Use the money to hire more mercenaries for your warband and upgrade the equipment of your mercenaries
5) Rinse and repeat

My 18 hour experience of the game consisted solely of these 5 steps. 

You will occasionally run into a random event like encountering a wanderer on the roads who tells you some stuff that doesn't effect gameplay or two of your mercenaries may end up in a fist fight and one receives a minor wound for one ingame day. I've never had any random event that influenced my plans in any way, nor do I think that there is any.

The ""influence system"" is one of the most hyped things - and I don't get what there's to hype about. There are a dozen or so settlements on the map and three major ""houses"" that own these settlements (about 4 each). If you do jobs for a settlement or a house, you increase your influence with said settlement or house. If you do something to piss them off, you'll lose influence with them. That said, even when I reached the maximum influence level with a settlement or a house, the effects where underwhelming at best. A settlement may have better prices for you ""on average"", but random events, that effect settlements and don't have anything to do with your influence, are much stronger when it comes to prices. You will have better prices in a settlement that is under the effect of a positive random event although you have only ""neutral"" influence on it than you will have in another settlement, with which you are ""very friendly"", but which is not effected by a positive random event. Random events that influence settlements happen very often, so it may be that you will have slightly better prices on average in settlements with which you have a high influence level, but that difference will be minimal. All in all, the influence system is another thing you don't need to care about. 

You move your warband in real time over the strategy map but play in turn-based mode when it comes to battle. The battle system is okay. You have to keep an eye on the ammo of your ranged fighters, your equipment may break, different enemies are prone to different tactics and so on. All in all not bad. That said, I steamrolled the game with a setup consisting of 3 archers, 1 standard bearer and the rest of my men used shields/spears. Spear wall is op. The RNG has way to much impact on the outcome though. 

The (few short) stories you get to read while playing are nicely written. The sound is unobtrusive. I've encountered only one bug and it wasn't game-breaking. I had no crashes.

You can't raid settlements, can't conquer lands or any kind of structures, can't own a headquarter. There's no diplomacy system except for that influence thingy I've mentioned above which is neglectable. There are no quests or quest lines, except for the contracts you take (go there, kill that, finished). There's no character or group development in a roleplaying sense, only raising stats and picking perks. Take a look at the five steps that I've listed at the beginning of the review and know that's what you will do for the entire time.   

Overall I would hesitantly recommend to buy Battle Brothers IF you can get it at a hefty discount as 28 € is waaaaay to much for a game that has nothing new or special to offer and could easily be a mobile port. 10 € would be fair IF...

...IF...

...they wouldn't have messed up the ending. That is: There is no ending. The devs obviously (and erroneously) thought that their game has enough to offer to be considered an open-end sandbox game like Mount&Blade and the like. Of course it's not. Repeating the five steps that I've mentioned at the beginning over and over and over again (there is literally nothing else to do) doesn't make this game a new Mount&Blade. Not even close. It took me 18 hours of grind to finally give in and look up in Google how the game is supposed to end...and then it comes out that there is no end. What kind of bad joke is this? Of course you see some progress with forming your warband and so on, but that progress gets smaller and smaller and there literally is nothing ""big and exciting"" that waits for you. There are so called late game crisis, but you don't have that much effect on them and basically they just mean a temporary change in the composition of enemies you have to fight. The crisis will end sooner or later, no matter if you've been digging your nose or fighting for your life.

95,30841807,english,"I recommend this game.

For one, the price is a joke considering what some games these days are going for. I guess if you was to compare, it is a much more simple version of Fallout, without the huge universe and graphics and the battles and missions are a little similar to Xcom. Obviously this is a small scale game by an indy developer, so you cannot compare the scope in any way.

The concept is a lot more similar than you think though, even though the setting is totally different. In other words you have an open world / sandbox game, you go around completing quests, improving your team, adding new weapons and armor. The battles are turn based though, similar to some of the older games like Might and Magic. 

There is some tactics involved and things like the opposition, terrain and choice of weapons can play a role in the outcome, but after several hours things do kind of get a bit repetitive, but the fact that i am playing for several hours, i highly recommend it.

The best part of the game for me is to see how your characters develop over time. Some of them get serious injuries which they carry with them such as losing an eye or breaking a knee. You need to have a strategy to develop new fighters because eventually the older ones die and that can become a huge task because you need to protect the rookies from getting mauled. It is also funny (or in my case less so) when your old school veteran ends up becoming a drunk after years of being on the battle scene. 

It would be nice if they added some basic little things such as ""quick travel"" or ""quick end"" turns after you used your action points, that will speed up the play. Also s

+ Open sandbox world
+ great customization of your Brothers
+ wonderful battle system
+ factions, relations , contracts
+ foot, tools, medic supplies to take care

Some minor flaws that i really hope they should be taken care of, by the developing team:
- although the battle is very very good, minor things about facing, flanking etc, do not make sense
- i feel a constant burden when it comes to paying my brothers their wage, and the game seems to push you to take contracts fast and continuously, without much of a freetime to explore
- i wish the world was a little more populated with battles left and right , more caravans, events, relations, other bands giving you quests or hire you etc

5,30809554,english,"After playing this game for more than 350 hours so far (of which 200 hours were invested since the beta update last month) and without any indication of being bored by it anytime soon, i just had to write a review for it, even though i never wrote one before and english is not my native language (as you probably can tell by now).

So instead of repeating all the things other reviews already told you, like that you manage a mercenary company and doing contracts in a random generated open world, i will entirely focus on the (for me) biggest strenght of this game. Even so the game is put in the genre of tactic-rpgs or strategy, i find it's more accurate described as a turn-based medieval combat simulation. All the things, that were of great importants for skirmishes with very few combatants 500 years ago, considering weapons, armour, skill of the fighters and terrain, are all taken into account, as well as morale and fatigue and the historical accurate role of every medieval weapon. To clarify my arguments i will provide some examples, but will hide them under spoilers, because for me, figuring these things out by myself was part of the fun (and challenge) of this game. So if you don't want to spoil yourself, you have to believe me without getting examples (maybe this review will be marked as helpful a lot to be a little more trustworthy ;)), but if you, on the other hand, are a fan of realistic, turn-based medieval combat and the high amount of positive reviews still not convinced you, you might as well give it a shot and look into the spoilers.

Your company in Battle Brothers will start with unexperienced fighters and low funds so which equipment would provide the most benefit in such a scenario? [spoiler]Spears were an all time favourite in ancient and medieval times, they are easy to use, cheap to produce, you can keep the enemy at bay and they provide good damage against unarmoured and light armoured targets. Equally useful were shields, so getting as much men as possible (outnumbering were obviously important as well, honour is useless) equipped with spears, shields and the best armour you can still afford after that (headgear is crucial!) will do wonders in the beginning.[/spoiler]

Most reviews are mentioning, how easy your brothers can die, so how complex can a combat system be, if keeping the own men alive is relying on pure luck of RNG? But while it's not easy by all means, and not losing men sometimes is impossible (at least on ironman), the game provides you with the necessary tools to avoid it most of the time. [spoiler]Medieval weapons were deadly, so in this game, most men will die from 2 Hits to the unarmored body or 1 to the head, and getting hitpoints on levelups will help them only slightly in that regard. Armour is absolutly important, wearing padded armour (a low tier armour) will let them survive roughly twice as many hits, decent helmets are a must as soon as possible. Hitpoints are not used to compensate for armour but to survive against weapons which have armour penetration (like crossbows), so a percentage based amount of damage is bypassing. Also using defensive abilitys (like raising their shield instead of attacking) with the brothers who are most vulnerable each turn is key. [/spoiler]

All weapontypes have a role they fulfill and using the right one against the right enemy will make the game much easier. [spoiler]Swords and spears are good against unarmoured enemys, while hammers work well against heavy armoured ones, axes destroy shields effectively, while flails ignore them and Polearms allow for attacks from the second row. And don't underestimate the dagger, who is (in the hand of a skilled fighter) able to ignroe the armour completely by aiming for the weakspots (like armpits).[/spoiler]

Going from early to late game simulates to some extend the progress of warfare in the medieval times. Starting only with light armour in the beginning, having access to heavy one later on allows you to change your playstile to some extend. [spoiler] In the late medieval times, heavy armour were more effective than the weapons, so defensive equipment like the shield were less important for someone, who could affort such an armour and were also a skilled fighter (like a knight). Two-Handed Weapons became more popular for them, same goes for Battle Brothers. [/spoiler]

While having all these tactical options at your disposal, i want to clearify that so have the human enemies you fight. They are having the same combat skills, they use the same weapons with the same stats, the same armour and taking their perks from the same pool you do, too (and they have the same level requirements for more advanced ones, so a level 1 thug will have no perks at all). They get no bonus to hit chance, or malus, in a situation were you wouldn't. The game is what i call fair in this regard and i really like this. The only disadvantage you have, which other reviews pointed out as well, is the limitation of 12 men you can bring to each battle while the enemys have no limitation at all.

With containing fantasy aspects, the game has the justification of providing you with different challenges like Orcs and Goblins, who, of course, have perks you can't possess, weapons you can loot but usually only use with penaltys and their unique tactics, so that you have to adapt to be sucessful. They are all very well implemented and the way to beat them always feels reasonable [spoiler]To name a few: Orcs are stronger and tougher, so you want to keep them at bay as long as possible, goblins are the opposite, wiedergänger (zombies) are ill fighters, have no fatigue or morale, come in great numbers and sometimes rise again after killing, so it will be a long battle and your men should pace themself.[/spoiler]

All these aspects of the complex combat mechanic would still be shallow and unsatisfying, if the AI couldn't make use of it. Fortunately she does a really good job. To be honest, i can't remember the last time, the AI in a turn-based game was this challenging and smart (without cheating of course). That doesn't mean she is perfect, there are some flaws and misscalcualtions at times, especialy when she is using specific perks, but they are very minor in comparison (and maybe get fixed in the future). Furthermore, the AI behavior is custom for every type of enemy, so Orcs act other than goblins or humans. [spoiler]Most enemies always aim for the weakest targets (highest chance to hit, lowest armour, lowest hitpoints) to outnumber you and higher their as well as breaking your moral, try to use highground to their advantage (even if they have to kick you from it for example), avoid spearwalls if possible and use defensive abilities like raise shield if they have to go through your spearwall, are easy to hit, outnumbered or wounded. If human enemies have the superior firepower with their ranged weapons, they will fire at you but keep their distance, while melee fighter raise their shields and spears if possible to protect themself and their archers. As soon as you have the superoir firepower, they try to close the distance as fast as possible, while still trying to avoid your spearwall. They will retreat after too many losses, while wiedergänger simply try to walk into melee and attack, doesn't matter if you activated spearwall or already killed 90% of them.[/spoiler] While playing, you can clearly see, that programming a good AI was really important for the devs and it paid off.

Pros:
+ Good 2D graphics and art.
+ Solid gameplay.
+ Feels finished, stable and bug-free.
+ Challenging.

Cons:
- Repetetive. What you see in the first 2 hours is what you'll see for the next 20.
- Some mission and terrain types are frustrating. E.g. when you defend a time from the undead, the town's militia, under AI control, breaks formation and suicides to the undead, both wasting time and making your life more difficult.
- The perk system has the usual problem - a few perks look great, while most look useless.
- The mercs could use a bit more personality. 
- The pacing felt off. A full run on beginner took me 25 hrs. Toward the end the game became a grind.

Overall if given the choice I would give this game a positive rating, but the game punishes you for playing risky, and by that I mean anything that isn't 100% safe is potentially game ruining. Any mission with 3 skulls is so risky that it isn't even worth doing, so you spend hours and hours doing 1 and 2 skull missions. I've started over 50 games and had 4 long campaigns (30 days or more game time), and if things don't go perfectly for you in the first 3 day game time, and I mean PERFECTLY, you better just quit and restart because it will catch up to you. If you lose 1 guy in your first mission, restart the game, because you've lost too much and you will be playing catch up the rest of the game. 

My last campaign that will probably make me quit I spent 40 days game time doing 1 and 2 skull missions. During that 40 days I lost 1 Battle brother. So I thought ""well, I've been playing this campaign for a week all my characters are level 5-9, I guess I should try a 3 skull mission"". I do the mission, win but lose 4 characters in the process, basically ending my game. Sure, I could go hire level 1 new recruits but they will be targeted and killed by the more difficult enemies I'm already encountering, and I lost some high level gear during that battle too.

10,30757326,english,"Battle Brothers is a non forgiving tactical rpg-ish game that places the player in the position of leading a group of mercenaries.
Your first act as leader will be to name your band.
The second will be to participate in a scripted battle, where your former band is decimated to the last 3 men.
The third will be to seek revenge on the man that set up a trap for you and the lost souls.
From there and with those 3 companions - if they're still alive at that point - you will seek to rebuild what was lost. 
Which means: gather gold and fame through fulfilling contracts available in your local towns and settlements.
Contracts provided by Mayors, Councillors and the most noble of the Houses...

Everything I detailed (other than the name you gave your company) is procedurally generated.
The towns, the people, the contracts, the 3 companions that you start with.
The worldset feels a lot like GoT with greedy men fighting and killing to get booze, fame and the like. While the land is inhabited by other things... 
Where procedural games feel usually lifeless, here the devs managed to do something that breaths life (it still procedural, it has its limitations).
All the contracts you get are tied to ingame events that really take place; every win, every loose will push forward or backward entities (bandit groups, settlements, other mercenary bands, bounty hunters etc.).
Although there is no city expansion nor conquest. Still camps of bandits and nests of goblins will appear on the map as they thrive.
Be wary though, as towns can get destroyed. Which usually come after spending numerous hours playing to the point where dark events take place.
You can ignore those events and enjoy your daily routines, or take part in them and have an influence in their unfolding.
That's one of the many beauties of the game: play the way you want where every interference is skippable and nothing can stop you and your band other than death and misfortune.
Although there are two storyline ''arcs'' that you can complete, you can still keep playing after they are concluded (or not).
There is no experience nor level limitation onto your men, they can increase their skills as mush as you want. Past a certain level, they will not be able to pick perks but they will still be able to increase their skill (ranged, melee, HP, resolve etc.).

There are a tons of different backgrounds and a number of different traits that will help characterize the men that will seek your employ.
They come from different professions: fishers, farmers, hedge knights, brawlers etc.
Those background professions do have an impact on your band and its activities, but also in special events that will occur.
Some of them, other than their starting skills, will be more or less proficient at improving specific skills.
Basically, each time a merc level up, he can increase 3 of his skills once.
If one man has two stars (**) in melee, it means that he will get a good dice to increase that skill.
Because every increase of a skill is RNG. It isn't for the player to decide how much he wants to invest in a skill. The game generate a number, usually between 1 and 5.
Note that this amount is fixed. It isn't possible to save and  to reload to get better income: each time one merc levels up, the game lets the player know how much it is possible to increase that skill. 
Let say you want to increase one of your men prowess in melee skill. But at the time of his level up, he got a bad dice of only +1. 
Then, maybe, you'll decide to revisit your priorities and instead increase his melee defense, which got a solid +4.
The game oddities will sometimes make you deflect from your plannifications for better outcomes. 
Picking men that are naturally proficient in learning one or another skill is critical for the higher levels and will help you to stay on track with your priorities. 


Last words: the game does great what it does, but it does not try to do anything else.
This isn't a sandbox game where you have diverse things to do.
You are running a mecernary company: Pick up contracts, hire new recruits, buy provisions and weapons, sell the spoil of battle, decide for some goals for your company and ''manage'' relations with settlements and noble families through completing contracts.

I have not played a game that so perfectly recaptures the hopeless, decaying world of Glen Cook's Black Company series or the old Myth games by Bungie. But far from being a simple nostalgic romp, Battle Brothers is an amazing tactics game with numerous potential ways to build your mercenary company. 

It is a challenging game, but rarely patently unfair. I find myself holding my breath on archer shots and heavy two-handed swings knowing that someone's life could very well end if they missed - but unlike previous games, a fatality or two in a mission does not feel completely game ending like it did the XCOM series. It was just a grim reminder of how sudden violence is in a world where mercenaries are needed to keep the roads safe from bandits and goblins.

Every part of this game was made with clear polish and loving attention to detail; the writing is spot on and ranges from grim to black humour, the mechanics feel tight and properly balanced, the different enemy factions provide completely different sets of tactical challenges from one another (keep each fight fresh! A strategy that works on brigands will not serve you against goblins!), the art is amazing, and the soundtrack is superb.

16,30811518,english,"Battle Brothers is an excellent game that combines a simple management and levelling mechanic with an enjoyable turn based battle system. The premise is to hire a band of mercenaries and wander the world doing various contracts, until your company either perishes, or you deal with one of the end game crises (though you can continue beyond this point and do all three if you like).

As such the meat of the game is the combat mechanics, and these hold up very well. Your mercenaries and your opponents each have a number of action pooints, with actions dependant on the weapons and other items they are carrying. Unusually for a game of this ilk, armour realistically trumps, yet at the same time, heavy armoured mercenaries will become bogged down in fatigue, making tactical planning necessary not only at the set up of an engagement, but also as it plays out.

The idea of endless battles, even against a varied set of enemies, only works if there is a reason for it, and this is where the campaign comes into play. You hire and fire, starve and march your mercenaries around the world, growing your reputation and deciding the kind of company you want to run. Some of your men will become familiar and treasured, others just a pile of rotting bones and a name in the roster of the dead: ""Disembowelled by Shagra the Slayer"", ""Beheaded by a raider"". 

By the end of it, one way or the other, you will have gathered up a mighty collection of these, for the game is hard, especially before you get the hang of when to run and when to fight - though you can to some extent choose when to lower your goals in order to stay alive. Yet at the same time that does make it more rewarding when you finally get your company up to a decent strength and manage to sustain it, building your named men to higher levels.

And a word also needs to go to the developers who stay constantly in contact with their players, adding and tweaking and listening to the ideas. What is clear is that they have produced a game they love themselves, and this has resulted in one that should be enjoyed by many of the turn-based genre ... and for the first time in a while I can give a 'what's it worth' recommendation of full price.

22,30788872,english,"I will change this review to a buy, if the problems I cover are fixed.

Great combat mechanics, though I'm currently noticing enemy ranged attacks have a massive hit chance bonus. This may be the result of level differences between myself and the enemy, though they infact seem slightly lower level. In either case, the enemies are hitting at approximately four-to-ten times my rate - and I'm using ""Fast Adaptation"". And they're hitting through interlinking shieldwalls - yes, they're hitting the guys holding the shields. They also seem to have extra range, though I don't know whether or not they have access to the talent which grants it. If this is consistent throughout the game, it's simply gamebreaking, as no amount of preparation or strategic mastery can overcome insultingly blatant overpowering.

The UI is severely flawed - relative to what little is required of it. The game speed defaults to the slower setting, and this can't be changed. You cannot rebind, despite needing very few keys. Equiping items is a bit weird: you can right-click to auto-equip, but have to ctrl-right-click to unequip. You are limited to one menu at a time in the inventory/town menu, and the organization options are very subpar, given that inventory management is a major component of the game. Scrolling around the large map can be problematic, as it sometimes simply won't move, or tethers the camera to your units. Bunch of basic, simple problems, that all add up to time wasted.

Overall, while the game is fun, and worth buying at a cheaper price, it's only real contribution to the genre is it's progress on formations in a melee/bow setting - which it does very well, and is interesting, when you forget that enemy archers completely trump every strategy. As a strategy fan, I play it just for the interesting approach to formations - working around enemy archers completely invalidating all strategies. But, as for all the other components which others are raving about: they've all been done before, and better; so I imagine the bulk of praise is from neophytes to the genre.

It's simply not worth 30 bucks for only making one real contribution to the genre, and being an ultimately shallow game, unless the player has OCD, and thus enjoys obsessively building statistically perfect teams. Pick it up for 20 if they fix those problems [and others I may find by end-game] and 10 if they don't. I assume they won't, given the undeserved positive reviews, and extremely lazily built UI.

Combat is fun, tactical and at many times frusterating. Seeing a brother who has been with you for nearly 100 days die in the first round of combat from a couple lucky crossbow bolts is soul crushing. This isn't just because this is some high level unit you don't want to lose, it's because seeing the death message of Volkar the Sergeant brings back the memories of his shooting competition with Dirk, the former blacksmith. The time he singlehandedly slew 10 men in the great siege of Moosberg Castle. After this, passing on the legendary spear he weilded since winning it from the bandit leader Horge to a new brother feels like betrayal. But it's a dope spear so you get over it.

This is almost more of a storytelling game than a strategy game, but the strategy layer is by no means shallow. Different enemies require different approaches, there are many different styles of units you can train which have different strengths and weaknesses. The game does an incredible job of having the characters and story develop throughout a playthrough, and the developers seem to love adding more events (as they should).


Some critisisms I have about the game:

- Music gets a touch repetitive, I find myself muting the game and playing my own music in the background.
- Occasional bugs, but they have been very good about fixing these through the beta.

Some suggestions I have for future updates:

- Once you piss off a village, it takes forever to get back to the point where you can deal with them again. The relation bar simply doesn't seem like it tends to zero.
- Combat does occasionally get a bit tedious, maybe the option to hire another mercenary group to deal with smaller jobs and take a smaller profit margain. Or even just have a mercenary company follow you to avoid 12 vs 50 fights as often.
- I don't know how well the game would accept it from a technical side, but Steam Workshop integration would be great. Or even just a config file that would allow users to change certain value (relation decay, prices, city density, rarity of unique items, number of potential recruits, ect)

If you reach a point where you can't think of how you can recover, you can retire, which gives you a cool little bit of story tying up how your remaining band members live on (or don't) and gives you your score, gently nudging you to start your next adventure.
The combat is top-tier turn-based, tactical combat, with all the expected nuance - terrain height and effects, buffs and debuffs, stuff to hide in or behind, and terrain to use to your advantage based on your needs. The combat never feels truly unfair because, at the end of the day, you will make small tactical errors, and your mercenaries will die sometimes, and they will die horribly. Once you accept this, realising this game is a roguelike as much as it is a tactical turn based RPG, dying becomes simply part of the experience and as much of a badass as Hermann may be, sometimes you just gotta accept that some people aren't supposed to leave all fights with a head on their shoulders. And hey, you can always retreat. Hermann might not get his head swiped off/caved in as he runs. You never know.

Battle Brothers is a game about turning a band of Low-life Cutpurses and Farmers into a cohesive fighting force able to crush a invasion of orcs twice the size of a man, and then while you're doing your victory lap your star brigand-turned-knight who killed 80 orcs takes a unlucky spear to the lung and chokes on his own blood/ends up a cripple.

It mixes the best parts of games like Xcom (Progression, lethality, random chance) with the best parts of games such as Mount And Blade (Worldmap, Trading, Gereral Mercenary Shennanigans) and it ends up turning into a incredibly competent and tense turn based strategy game.

Combat, while not innovating in the genre, is a well done and competent hex-based system, you hit a man with a stick, he loses health, modified heavily by armor and weapontype, and the guy doing the hitting builds up stamina, which is based on level and the armor they're wearing. Different enemies require different tactics to defeat, though having a front rank of heavy armor with a back rank of polearms is always a great go-to. In short, if you play anything that LOOKS like this, it won't hold too many surprises.

Speaking of Armor, progression is different, nothing here is based on ""YOU HAVE LESS THAN 700000XP SO YOU CANNOT USE THIS +1 STICK!"" Anyone can equip anything, but if you try and stick a gravedigger in a suit of knightly plate, he isn't going to be able to move around very much, or if you give a archer a longsword they're not going to know how to use it.

On the flip side of that, the game attempts to do armor more or less realistically, you can't just level a man up and pump health into him, a sword's going to do the same amount of damage either way, so you stick a man in armor and he goes from ""Dirty Peasant who'll die in a second"" to ""Dirty Peasant who can get a few swings off first.""

Last but not least, the writing for events and contracts is superb; whoever wrote them really manages to get across the concept of the world and makes you feel like you're the leader of a scumbag mercenary company.

The only things I can think of for cons is that it has no modding support (Yet, Devs have talked about it before, but it's in that etheral period of 'maybe once we're done') and that early-game can be incredibly unforgiving since you have no gold buffer to repair if you get trashed in a fight, late-game sure, you're losing some great soldier, but you can take his armor off his corpse.",1490688155,1490688155,True,5,0,0.55130159854888916,0,True,False,False,76561198005328356,274,5,9103,0,5480,1558048773,,

The feeling of sheer terror when you get caught by a crack troop of mercenaries after you've just managed a nasty scruff? 
How about the satisfied smirk when you beat the brigands into pulp and gotten some sweet sweet armour?

Make no mistake, this game makes you feel. Maybe thats why I can't put it down since the late beta.

The core behind this gem is a robust but extremely intricate turn based combat system. You have to adjust tactics to changing foes, and its a steep learning curve. But manage it and you'll feel like a king besting opponents that had you reeling in previous iterations.

I recommend a normal playthrough before stubbing your toe on the ironman mode, but it is the way you should play the game. 

Considering all this its amazing how small the development team is. They had regular updates through the beta and patching is an iterative thing rather than a stopgap. Truly what you want to see if you buy into an early access.

So if you have the slightest interest in turn based tactics, are OK with putting yourself through some paces, then buy Battle Brothers and give your mercenary a stupid name.

There is a living world map that your actions can affect. See towns shrink and fall into disrepair as bandits raid caravans and the town itself, intervene and the townsfolk will rebuild and look to your men favorably, or take advantage of the situation by raiding a few caravans yourself. Strike out into the untamed wilds and discover camps of greenskins building on the edge of civilisation, or necromatic cultists dabbling with things they shouldn't.

The narrative tone is brilliant as well, with Crusader Kings style events bringing character to your company and men. In an era of 4 hour single player experiences and mindless shooters, Battle Brothers stands out as a breath of fresh air.

The music is really really good.

50,30771326,english,"One of the things that is really holding my attention with the game is the overall difficulty has stayed very consistent, while the risks/reward aspect increases as you progress. BB is a difficult game, both in terms of in-battle decisions, and with regard to larger, long-term stuff (when and who to hire, when/what to buy).

At the very beginning, the challenge is learning the basics, but you are also facing basic enemies that don’t bring a great deal of complexity to combat, while your own units aren’t yet specialized. It’s not quite “line up and swing away”, but it’s not terribly far from that, especially if you aren’t hyper-focused on minimizing damage and just want to win. The economy aspect also starts simple, where you are mostly focused on having food and tools, and you aren’t really diving into buying equipment or moving trade goods between settlements.

At the mid-point of the game, more of these things start to factor in. As you gain levels, you open up more abilities or specializations, which you need to align with the gear you have. Say for example you hire an amazing archer with fantastic ranged stats/bonuses, but you haven’t gotten a single decent ranged weapon yet. It would make sense to seek one out on the market, but how much do you spend and where? (at the first city you find, or do you run contracts for a city with a bowyer to increase your reputation and lower the price to create a more long-term solution?)

Let’s say you have that great archer, and are working on reputation with a city that has a bowyer. Suddenly in an encounter that archer is killed. Now what? Do you scrap the whole general direction you were going in, or continue and attempt to hire a suitable replacement? What happens when you pay a high price for a replacement, and their stats/bonuses just aren’t worth really focusing on?

And all of that is just one example, and you will likely have half a dozen such example going at the same time in one game, with varying degrees of impact, complexity, and demand. If two settlements are in close proximity with each other and produce profitable trade goods, you will really want to focus on that area and build a reputation to get lower buy, higher sell prices. But maybe the game has other ideas, and the contracts you are offered are ones to protect a caravan that is traveling to the other side of the map. If you keep declining them, you might not have other work to do. If you accept them, now you aren’t in that area. If the towns are often hit by raiders pillaging supplies, or greenskin raids, prices and supply will also suffer, and your once profitable area is now (at least until you fix it) poor and doesn’t produce what you need to keep going.

The final layer is once you are further in, and you have higher-level mercenaries with mid to high-end gear, a single death or crippling injury is now far more of an issue than it was earlier in the game. Lost gear is much harder to replace, and if the merc lost was also a specialist, his replacement will be both costly and difficult to find. If your general battle strategy counted heavily on the specialist (say a center line holding defensive guy), until you replaced that guy and his general effectiveness, you either can’t fight the same difficulty of battles (not always an option), or you have to change up how you fight.

Now multiply the problem of a single merc lost with a battle that goes really poorly and you lose two, three, or even six+ guys. Sure you can give up and restart, but it’s far more fun to try and recover, which is possible but is its own complex set of problems.

All of this really only works in Ironman mode too. If you save scum BB, you really are going to ruin the game. Being able to reload after a failed contract negotiation, or a bad battle, or even to only hire the best recruits not only cheapens the whole experience of difficult decisions and dealing with them, but you will also out-scale the difficulty since you are accepting only the best results all the time, which the game isn’t balanced around. Even if you generally stay away from Ironman modes in other games, don’t do that here. It should also be noted that Battle Brothers is intended to be played multiple times. Each game has its own map, towns, units; basically everything is different but the game basics, so don’t be afraid of playing with one band, it going poorly, and now having to ‘repeat’ the game again. It really won’t feel like that, and you won’t see that brilliance if you save scum and progress with only one perfectly-played merc company.",1490618185,1490618185,True,18,0,0.631951034069061279,0,True,False,False,76561198005852941,219,7,35133,0,8423,1599274100,,

There are some other minor contracts available but you spend so much time wandering around trying to stumble across them, those contracts are worth less than the cost of finding them in the first place.

Then there is your merc group, where you have two choices. 
1) Keep the group reasonably small and give them half decent equipment. The only problem with this is that, you get outnumbered and men will die. Of course you can't afford to replace the men & equipment, so basically you are screwed.

2) Create a large group, but because you've spent all your money on men you can' afford to give them but the most basic equipment. So your badly equiped group inevitably takes casualties and your men die. Of course you can't afford to replace the men and equipment, so basically you are screwed.

53,30769491,english,"After a long hiatus from Battle Brothers, since September last year, I finally downloaded the Beta at the end of February and have updated to the final release now. I have enjoyed the early access but I decided to take a break last year until more content was implemented.

I am just casual gamer who enjoys tactical and strategy games. After a couple of short games to get back into the groove, I decided to start a veteran non-ironman game. I found that I still enjoy most of the game, the expanded content made it fresh for me once more.

Battle Brothers has always seemed to me as a land-based version of the old Microprose Pirates. Instead of a crew of pirates, the player is managing a band of mercs. With the option to opt out of the late game crisis, BB is also a sandbox like Pirates. 

One of the things I like about the game is that it allows a player to decide (for the most part) how difficult or challenging an experience it will be. Apart from FTL and Thea: The Awakening, I am not much of a permadeath/ ironman gamer and I like that BB gives me the choice to choose the mode of play as well as the game difficulty. 

On the whole, I enjoy the pacing of my campaign allowing me (just enough) time to rebuild a company strong enough to meet the game's ""late game crisis"". The late game crisis (which can be turned off when starting a campaign, randomised or the play choose a starting crisis) is one of three major events which will take place around mid-game involving either a war among the noble houses in the game world, an invasion of orcs and goblins or an invasion by the undead.  Only one crisis will take place at a time and once resolved, a second random crisis will occur after an interval. Play long enough and the crisis wil will repeat itself.

The crisis can impact the game world in a major manner and offers many challenging contracts for the company including defending towns, take part in raids or taking part in a major battle. 

In terms of random events and mercenary contracts, I feel that there are sufficient events and contract types for me not to get bored. Although I would like to see additional contract types, after awhile bandit/ creature hunting do get a bit stale.

Apart from making money as a mercenary, it is also possible to make a fair bit of money from trade.

The game world is fairly dynamic, life goes on with or without the player's mercenaries. Mines can be raided by bandits or orcs setting up new camps, farms rebuilt.

This is not to say that the game is perfect. One aspect of the game that will turn many off is the difficulty of the game and (initially) the surprise that comes from fighting certain opponents without being aware of their capabilities. This can and will result in many defeats. 

Recruitment is interesting as each mercenary you recruit comes from many different background ranging from vagabonds, butchers, hunters to professional fighting men such as sellswords or hedge knights.  Each background comes with certain advantages and disadvantages and can event effect the general events that the company can encounter in the game world.

Each mercenary will have stats will governs their attack/defence (split into melee and range) skills, stamina, hitpoints, bravery and initiave.

On top of that, there is a skill tree to further customise each mercenary as they gain in experience and levels. The skill tree can give each merc various special skills or proficiencies to help them in combat including weapon specialisations to the ability to escape from being pinned down in close combat to being able to better make use of heavy armour.  Also as each merc goes up in a level, they gain a certain number of points based on their inherent talent and a random roll to adjust up to three stats.

Each mercenary may also come with positive or negative personality features/traits including being short, or having quick reflexes to being insanely brave.

The is plenty of diversity and customisation available.

However, one aspect of the recruitment mechanics means that you only have a very general idea that on the quality of recruit you're hiring for your mercenary band. When hiring some one, you can only see their name, background, a brief bio and their visible equipment. You don't really know how good (you can't see the stats) they are at anything and what personality trairs or features they have. In fact, you can't even tell if they are short, fat or disabled. You can may think you're hiring a hunter (basically the archer class) only to find that he is marginally effective as an archer and much better as a melee fighter. 

I don't mind not seeing the skills or even the personality traits but how can we miss if a recruit is fat or short. And surely we will give them some sort of test to see if they know which end of the spear is pointed towards the enemy before taking them on.  Maybe a case can be argued about not caring for sword fodder farmboys but if I am hiring a professional sellsword and paying that much money for him, I will certainly test his competence.  Then again, as a game mechanic, if we get this most players would generally avoid anyone but the best.

All of this is determined by RNG. This brings up one point that many new players have difficulty adjusting to in the game, the RNG.

RNG plays a major factor in all aspects of the game, from map generation, to hiring, to goods available for sale, mercenary contracts and of course, the combat mechanics. All of this can be dealt with and managed by an experienced player. Inexperience players will wonder why their men keeps missing and the AI opponents keep slaugthering them. One thing to bear in mind is that most tactical-RPG or even RPG games, our PCs or teams are relatively god-like. This is not the case in Battle Brothers especially in the early game and certainly for players new to the game.

On combat, funny enough, I don't really have any issues with the combat (yet). The number of opponents are mostly manageable as I have faced mid-sized groups. I did not optimise my team to have the 'best' builds and have been fairly successful. Using a variety of tactics, many of which were helpfully given by game veterans in various discussions, I am able to manage most situations. My casualties thus far comes from bad luck and in a couple of case, stupidity and overconfidence on my part.

My complaint is that you can meet with very tough (late-game) opponents very early in the game. And due to circumtances, you can't avoid combat. This will result in a wipeout, a pyrrhic victory which lots of death or injuries or the band should tactically retreat from the fight. If for some reason, tactically retreating (ie walking off the map) is not possible, there is a ""get out of jail"" free retreat button to escape from combat.  This will result in all of the mercs deployed to fight getting non-permanent injuries which will wear off over time. 

Concerning unfair or complaints of AI-biased RNG rolls, I don't know enough about how RNGs are generated but the system feels ok to me. I used to play pen and paper RPGs and table-top wargames, and I have seem/ experience enough ridiculous results. I have personally rolled a '1' in four consecutive rounds of combat in D&D. That being said, there are enough occassions where I do see hit/ miss streaks in BB. This happens to my mercs and to the AI. Perhaps this 'streakiness' should be look into. This is just my personal observation. In all, I don't have a problem with the RNG.

There are many helpful strategies in the discussion forum and new players would need to do some reading up. I find this to be a one of the weakness of the game in the form of the difficult entry barrier for new players.

Would I recommend the game game? I have mixed feelings on certain elements but I have spent a fair bit of time since early access. On the whole, I would say yes, I would recommend Battle Brothers.

57,30740476,english,"The main problem of the game is simple and easy to explain: UI. All the big problems with it stem from that one single feature. 

The UI manages to tell you absolutely nothing, basic mechanics are never explained, stats have vague ""this is what it does"" statements while at other points the UI actively hurts the game. For a game that is about RNG management not to properly give enough informations about what something does is a sin against the genre itself. However, while it doesn't give enough information, it somehow manages to give too much. While it's not telling you one thing, the important information, it's telling you a long, wordy, fluff story that doesn't say anything about anything. 

On the world map, you move from town to town and, in order to go into town, you'd think to click on the town or the flag or the name of the town, and you'd be right, but not really. Sometimes in order to open the town menu, you click on the flag, other times, you click on the buildings, and other times, you click on the nameplate. There is no definitive ""click here"" button. 

However, the more problematic issue with the UI has to do with the art style and terrain height. Depending on the angle and differences in terrain height, you might not be able to see your units on the battle map. The hex and where to click to move there, can sometimes be UNDER another hex, making it tedius to find the right place to click. 

Additionally, on the battle map, the unit roster for humans enemies and your troops is too similar. There is very little difference in the model for bandits and your actual troops. The ""base"" of the sprite is slightly different, but you'll be fighting enemies that look almost completely identical to you (and I've made some errors because of it). This also works incredibly poorly in combination with the aforementioned ""height"" problem, where your enitre unit model can disappear and almost becomes an invisible unit, but even the wrong angle can hide the ""base"" of the sprite, which is the main way to tell which is which. Luckilly, this problem goes away when you face the undead or orcs, as their sprites are suffeciently different enough to easily differentiate between your units and the enemy's. 

The core game is basically Mount and Blade meets Darkest Dungeon. That sounds great, but as I play more, I find myself simply wanting to go play either Mount and Blade or Darkest Dungeon, and not Battle Brothers. It does both suffeciently well (minus the UI) but not great. It's a lite version of both, that is outshown by both. It lacks the depth and complexity of M&B and the charm and RNG management of Darkest Dungeon. Originally, I felt like the game did enough, but the more I play it, the more I see that I'd just rather play the other games I already had. Expansions/DLC would certainly help with its' ""Jack of all Trades, master of none"" problem, but I'm not sure if I'm invested enough into the game to care about DLC in the future. 


Originally, I had made a positve ""recommend"" review (after, iirc, 4 hours game time), but quickly the love afair with the game died out. I mentioned the UI previously as annoying, but not a dealbreaker, but now, after having played it a few hours more, it has become a chore to use the UI and, as such, a dealbreaker imo. I've run into several bugs and issues that, while minor, are rather gamebreaking when it is a game about RNG management and you have a crossbowman who can't do anything because of a bug. 

In my experience with this game, if you only plan to play about 4 hours of it, you'll love it. However, anything above 4 hours and the problems and annoyances will start to creep in there and ruin the game. Once the ""new car smell"" wears off, you'll realise that this is one half Mount and Blade, one half Darkest Dungeon with a terrible UI and stress the ""half"", a game that stives to be two games at once, but manages to be less than the sum of their parts.",1490492541,1490591563,False,3,0,0.516670346260070801,0,True,False,False,76561198007947984,223,33,603,0,529,1555365568,,

Battle Brothers is a game about a rag-tag merc company set in a low-fantasy sandbox world.

It's made by German developers inspired by games like Warhammer, Mount & Blade, X-Com - just to name a few.

The game starts with your defeat and to get your outfit back to full strength is an uphill battle. You and your company of mercs must band together, uplift your coffer, and restore the glory that you have lost.

The devs created this world that's so surreal - and yet so believable - complete with politics, war, and disaster. The music composed in this game perfectly complements the setting and I just can not get the soundtrack out of my head.

77,30739991,english,"There's only one word for this game: incredible. The developers have created an amazing game, with solid mechanics and phenomenal artwork. 

Pros: 
-An unrestricting perk system. Rather than choosing between an ""Axeman"" path or a ""Spearman"" path, locking you into those set paths, you can specialize each and every man in your roster.
-Amazing graphics and soundtrack. These really do make the game great. The art is unique and appropriate, with a nice, gritty feeling that suits the tale of mercenaries. The music is very atmospheric, and really helps the long treks go by.
-A believable setting. The game does not delve deeply into the lore, but it does drop interesting hints. The noble houses vary between each other, with some honorable and others cruel, but they strike a good balance between themselves. The townspeople vary as well, but it ultimately sets realistic dynamics between the noble and the dastardly.
-Challenging gameplay. The enemies, and there are a lot of them, are all difficult in their own way. Some eventually lose their threatening status (Lookin' at you, Brigands), but the Greenskins, Nobles, and the Ancient Dead more than pick up the slack.
-Equipment variance. You can get a stunning amount of different armors and weapons in Battle Brothers. Arming swords, scramasax, pikes, warbrands, lutes, throwing javelins, butcher's cleavers, and military picks are just a small selection of the stuff you can fight with. What about armor, you say? Well, try a blotched gambeson, or a set of full plate, or scale mail, or just send them out in a potato sack with a bag over their head if you so choose!

Neutral:
-Permadeath. The threat of death is constantly looming over your men, and no one is safe. Some players love this, others not so much. The developers do help a bit with the Autosave feature in normal mode, but Ironman mode has no mercy.
-Fast Travel. There is a fast travel system in the game, by hiring a boat to sail you between port towns. It is by no means always comprehensive, as the procedurally-generated world may make only two ports and put them next to each other, but when it's not it makes several jobs much easier.

Cons:
-Lag. It's not often, but when it occurs it's bad. Normally, you'll never see it, but it's all too common in the end-game crises. The game simply isn't good at handling over 40-50 characters operating on their own, and when both sides can easily be 30-40 each...
-The !#$*&#% Necrosavants. I hate them. They are entirely OP. You can deal with two or three even in the midgame, but 7-15? Nope. You're donezo. They can teleport twice in one turn, have the Nine Lives perk keeping them alive when to rights they should be dead, have cleavers that devestate armor, and every point of damage they deal heals them. Usually they can easily be avoided, but when they can't you can have serious problems.

87,30744572,english,"It was little over a month since the Sons of Valor cheated death at the hands of Hoggart the Weasel's measly band of scoundrels, our company was on its way to scour a nest of Goblins that had been harrying the nearby fort of Schwertfeste at the behest of House Thurah.  After a harrowing encounter with a pack of wolf riders we came upon a far more taciturn sight: A procession of children, declaring themselves on a holy quest to spread the word of the Old Gods.

Now I was a leader of a band of cutthroats out to shed blood for coin, but I would be damned if I allowed a bunch of filthy brats to march out to their ends with greenskins about, so I looked to my Sergeant, an ex-holy man I knew as Bernhard The Preacher to set them straight.  I'd expected a beating and a chiding from the old battleaxe but to my surprise he knelt down and calmly explained to the children that they were not chosen to crusade for the Gods, but to be their messangers.  After all, here were we, a band of warriors set to protect the land from the iniquities that beset it (for a modest fee of crowns, hem hem) standing before them with our blades still fresh in the blood of Goblins that would have gladly stolen the tykes away to try their vile poisons on.  The children, happy with their new role as messengers of the Gods, gladly returned to Schwertfeste while we continued on.

When the battle was joined, Bernhard fought like a madman, slashing and decapitating whatever foul monster stood in his way until all that was left was a single archer that had harried us like mad through the entire battle.  Knocked senseless by our axeman, the goblin could only look with terror into the eyes of this holy warrior of the Gods as one slash with a falx he'd claimed from a run-in with the ancient imperial dead cleaved its head from its shoulders.

On that day Bernhard was a preacher no longer, baptized in the blood of the greenskisns, he became a that I would gladly call my Brother:

Wow, it has been quite the pleasant journey with Overhype studios. I almost think people should just buy this game based on the transparent model they used in terms of scheduling updates and communicating to their fans. Steam should definitely take notice and encourage this type of behaviour from developers. The game has evolved from a barebones Mercenary sandbox game to a living and vibrant world. 

Battle Brothers is a low fantasy turn-based strategy game set in a medieval European-like world. You can assemble a group of up to 12 mercenaries and take on various contracts. The contracts can range from caravan escorting to assaulting an enemy camp. As mentioned previously, the battles are turn based. Your men start off some distance in a line opposite of the enemy. The outcome of the battle depends on your gear, level, and stat and skill distributions.

Over the course of the game your Mercenaries will level up, acqurie better gear, and take on harder contracts. Skill and inventory management are key.

Bottom-line: if you have been on the fence about buying this game, or if it seems interesting to you go ahead and buy it. The amount of hours you can sink into this game are many and for the price it is currently at you are getting quite the deal.

It can be somewhat of niche genre. If you're not into Sandbox/design your own destiny games it may not be for you. You probably also need to be ok with turn based combat. If you loved Final Fantasy Tactics or Fire Emblem (although Battle Brothers doesn't have ""magic"" per se) you will probably like this game.

If you can survive that long to get those perks of course!

There is something incredibly satisfying about surrounding an enemy knight, who is wearing armor worth more than all your peasant mercenaries will ever see in their lifetimes, netting him, then knifing the shit out of him for his fancy armor. And then dropping it on your bad ass peasant farmhand to proceed to murder more uppity nobles for their fancy shit as well.

I immensely look forward to whatever these devs put out, as the art, sound, gameplay and general writing are superb, and deserve to be expereinced by everyone.

You may be saying, ""Well you only played like 3 hours"" and I will tell you that it took only that long for me to be bored enough to quit playing and angry enough to write a review about my experience. 

If you don't already know, Battle Brothers is a game where you captain a mercenary squad in a dark/norse style fantasy world. You move your little chess piece looking guy around the map from town to town picking up contracts for gold which you will need to cover your squad's expenses(pay, food, repairs, meds) as well as purchase recruits and upgrade equipment. These contracts range from, going to a graveyard to beat up some badguys(graverobbers!), to going to a graveyard to beat up some badguys(but hey its not graverobbers this time around!) In the time i spent with the game i completed around 10 contracts, 2 delieveries, 4 graveyards, 2 monster hunts and 2 item recoveries. There may of been another contract where I had to go to a *not* graveyard to kill some bandits. At that point i had enough gold to recruit enough people to fill the shoes of the people who died getting me the gold and stock up on food and tools to prevent the not dead ones from starving and their weapons and armor from breaking. Yes, perma death is a big part of the game, and unless you are save scumming constantly to avoid losses you are going to lose people. And its pretty easy for characters to die(no bleed out phase when hp is gone, just dead), especially if all they are wearing for armor is a cloth sack, but armor costs money, lots of money, so i better go find another village with a graveyard that is full of bandits/ghouls/skeletons for me to kill and get money from.

If you havent figured it out yet, what I'm trying to say is that the game is a grind, a big monotonous one. And frankly, unless you absolutely love the combat, which i wasn't impressed with at all (if anything it frustrated me), then I don't see anything really redeeming about this game.

So why did I vote it down? Well, and this is just my humble opinion, the game is far too difficult (BRUTAL!!) for most of us who enjoy this type of game.  Sure, I can understand some players wanting a high challenge/god mode/ironman mode/masochist mode...... etc. etc.  but this is way too hard even on the easiest level of difficulty.  In addition, I've yet to see a seasoned you tuber play this on the high difficulty settings, and complete a full run!!  and I'm talking about serious strategy lets players, as even they play it on the easiest settings...and admit how difficult it is. What hope in hell is there for us.  
 
Then there's the micromanagement... what with you always, needing to make sure that you have enough food (which spoils), repair tools, to repair your equipment after every battle etc.. Whilst never really having enough money to keep buying these things, and still be able to pay your mercs.  Also, no matter how high your mercs level up, they will never ever be at the same level, or have enough skill to beat some enemies they will meet.. Like vampires.. Just to mention one example. 

I really like this game, and I want to enjoy playing it.  But a single loss, say to you highest level merc, and you can kiss your campaign bye bye as there'll be no point in continuing if your roster of high level mercs is not deep enough. 

Finally, since this is a single player game, the lack of real story is a missed opportunity imho.

34,30717311,english,"This game rocks.  You command a company of murderhobos going across the land trying to get paid by killing things.   You fight in a turn-based system on a hex grid, and between battles you wander on the world map looking for clients or foes.  The context is a well fleshed-out low-magic late medieval/early renaissance setting.

The battles in this game are intense.  The AI is pretty relentless, and the odds are often not in your favor.  You fight a variety of foes, including bandits, orcs, goblins, and the undead.  The major factions are all well-developed and each fight in a distinctive style: mindless Wiederganger zombies shamble at your men without pause, while crafty goblins harass you with hit-and-run tactics with their bows, poison, and nets.  Every moment counts because if you are unlucky your men can drop from perfect health to dead or nearly so in the flash of an eye.  You can and will lose men, especially if you're playing on Ironman.  You need to manage the fatigue system to make sure your advances don't run out of steam.  The morale system also provides a cool way of modeling the tide of battle turning.

You manage the general business of the company, giving you a pause from the intensity of battle.  You have to make sure your men are paid, fed, and well-supplied.  You also customize your company by buying equipment upgrades (or loot and repair them from your fallen foes) and leveling up your men as they accumulate experience.  This consists of increasing basic attributes as well as choosing special perks from a tree.  An example is 'Pathfinder', which reduces the movement cost of uneven terrain.  I will note that the attributes aren't quite made equal; for instance, most Brothers need increases to their Melee Skill, Melee Defense, and maximum Fatigue, whereas increased Initiative rarely seems comparably worthwhile.

The game is not a sandbox per se, but has many similarities.  You are occasionally pursued on the road by wandering raiders, but the vast majority of battles will be chosen by the player via the contracts system.  For instance, this allows you to take your time with a hopefully sedate courier or caravan mission while your company is repairing its equipment and healing the temporary injuries suffered in battle.  The game has an ambition system giving you medium-term goals for building up your company.  The game until recently had an open-ended endgame (enemy groups get increasingly dangerous), but the developers recently implemented a late-game crisis system, introducing one of three possible world-changing events to deal with.  These can be disabled, however, if you prefer more of a sandbox.

This game was made by a small team, but does very well on the art front given their constraints.  The unit sprites don't seem impressive at first, until you start to pay attention to details.  Armor shows damage as it's degraded, and injured brothers start to look increasingly beat-up.  There is distinct music for various enemy factions, and the sound effects do a chillingly good job of making battle feel visceral and brutal.  Every contract includes little vignettes of the interactions, and the game also has random events.  In both of these cases the writing does a good job evoking a grim, unforgiving world.

I picked up the game late in the Early Access period, and during that time the developers have been actively supporting the game with bugfixes and balance tweaks.  I hope the sales provide them with the ability to continue to give support and possibly even to add more content.

All in all, this game does an excellent job of making you tell yourself 'OK, just one more contract' again and again.  The combat and leveling systems are deep enough to make winning against the odds feel thrilling, and due to the lethality of battle every clean victory is met with a sigh of relief.  A single campaign is easily dozens of hours, and the procedural nature of the world means that if the game clicks for you the replayability is nearly endless.",1490409522,1490409522,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198052835313,328,32,4507,0,3573,1495385381,,

44,30714310,english,"Battle Brothers is a turn-based tactics game, set in a low-fantasy medieval world. It bears heavy influences of titles like classic Darklands, Jagged Alliance, with a strategic layer very reminiscent of Mount&Blade. It is a great game, an example of Early Access done right, showing how developers with clear vision can make a polished game that delivers exactly what was promised

Positives:
- The tactical layer is fun to play, every weapon comes with own set of skills, the interconnected systems make you take into account positioning, fatigue, terrain, elevation, etc. Battles can be very hectic, especially at higher difficulties
- Game features varied set of enemies that are not just a reskins with shuffled stats. Fighting Goblins is totally different to facing Orcs, Skeletons or Nachzehrers (ghouls)
- It is a breath of fresh air, that it is not yet another generic fantasy/medieval, but instead a dark, gothic darklandsesque world of evil lurking in black forests. Many of its aspects have unique twist, my favourite being the Ancient Dead, Undead based off Roman Legions in place of your generic skeletons
- The presentation, considering we are talking a smaller indie dev is really astonishing. A proof there are other ways than expensive 3d photorealism, or the omnipresent pixelart trend to make your game look good
- RPG elements are reasonably fleshed out, your mercenaries can have many traits affecting their effectiveness, skills are varied and are impactful gameplaywise

Negatives, but depends on what kind of player You are:
- The game is repetitive, you get contracts, fight battles, and try to make money and develop your company, rince and repeat. There is barely any story, little premade scenarios. Both tactical battles and management side are well made, but ultimately they are the only things that you will be doing during the game
- Some battles can drag on, especially in marshes and ESPECIALLY against zombies. It is not a prevalent problem but sometimes the fights feel like hassle, they take a lot of time, while not posing a challenge

81,15660207,english,"Nothing has changed about my support for this game. I bought the supporter edition back when Battle Brothers finally went into Early Access. It was worth every Cent even back then and it is even more so now.

The devs put much love into every detail of the game.

You have your band of mercs you are traveling with across the map, doing jobs here and there always trying to hold your money together (atleast in the beginning of the campaign this can be challenging if you take some losses). There is never really a feeling of being overpowered. All the time you can loose a good man to a stray arrow. Even the weakest brigand archer can bring down your battle hardened veteran if he already took some beating.
And this is only when fighting the normal rubbish on the roads. There are much more sinister things around. Undead legions which never fatique and never loose morale, moving tanks of ironclad orc warriors and sneaky little goblins with their poisoned arrows and deadly marksmanship.

What i love the most about this game is equipping my mercs. Especially finding rare or even unique pieces of amor is great.

The combatsystem which is the core of the game is turnbased while initiative dictates the order in which your own mercs as well as the foes attack.
The different foes i mentioned earlier do come with their very own tactics each. So you are forced to adapt to their abilities if you want to go out of the fight without losses.

The weakest part (if you can even call anything weak) of the game is the worldmap which can feel a bit too little interactive. You wander around from vilage to vilage or chase down (or getting chased by) enemies in the wilderness or search for hidden layers to attack.

I can only recommend this game.

I have never seen another Early access done as good as this. The devs were highly receptive to suggestions for improvements and the final product shows they have done a great job.
Unfortunately not everything they wished to be able to put in was possible do to time and finacial reasons so I do wish them best luck with todays release to then be able to further improve this gem of a game to brings us a worthy expansion :)

###### Old Review #######

This game is an alpha version right now. It is neither feature complete nor is it balanced (how could it possibly be at that point?). But I don´t mean this in a negative way. Most games that are sold here on steam which are called finished games do not even come close to this one.

Some may not like the artstyle. I for myself do like it very much. While that might be personal preferences noone can deny that the devs have put much love in every piece of art you will encounter in the game.

While the game does speak for itself (There are countless gameplay videos on Youtube) it is the cooperation and communication between the devs and their customers that really makes a difference. Think of Bethesda or EA. These do not care what their customes think or want.

I have followed the development process for half a year by now. Nearly every week there was a new blog with tons of new information. Now that the EA-version has been released I also like how these three guys throw out one patch after another eliminating bugs as if they were on a killing spree and still got the time to look through all the posts in the steam forum aswell as their own. They are doing an amazing job and most of the time it feels as if there were 30 and not only three of them.

Update:
Some time later, the game progresses very well. The artstyle got even better and there is still a big update coming before the release.",1430603011,1490365312,True,3,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True,76561197967140067,256,3,40176,256,18424,1601829636,,

It worths every cent you spend on it.

Hans and Randolf were my origional mercs at the start of the game, with them, I learnt how to manage my company and how to fight, the two guys' gears were slowly upgraded as the game goes and the company has been making more and more crowns, and we hired some low cost mercs, train them, build them up. Around Day 20 midnight it was, my company was heading to a town to see if there's any contract job to do, we were attacked by a pack of direwolves near forest. During the tough fight, Hans, faught to his last breath with the newly accquired Greatsword, yet he was ripped to pieces by the direwolves, fortunately the rest of the company survived, just had to leave Hans R.I.P and carry on our journey. We became more cautious since then and my mercs had built up their skills with better and solid gears. And Randolf was of course made the captain, I gave him a Flail and a Kite Shield with the best amoures we had. Day 30, after a 3 star contract job, my company was heading back to the town to collect our reward, we were ambushed by some raiders and thugs. Most of my company men were injuried from the previous mission, good old Randolf stepped out as the company leader, jumped into the bad guys. Well, his head was chopped off by an axe weilding raider. I then commanded my men to retreat and left poor Randolf's body on the battlefield, didn't look back. Sad.

I watched upon my company, all men sustained all kinds of injuries, broken ribs, hands, knees etc. And the company has only less then 1000 crowns left. I did not know how to continue with the game. Then, I looked at the real life date, guess what, it's 24/03/2017. Then:

89,30699610,english,"Battle Brothers-

A turn-based strategy management game. The overall game is navigated via a world map (think Mount and Blade) that is randomized with each playthrough, with cities, and points of interest acting as nodes. Interacting with a node will take you to one of two screens, either a city or a battlefield. 

Cities are little more than beautiful menus you navigate to recruit, outfit, train, heal, and receive quests. 

Battlefields are hex-based and cover, concealment, and height all factor into combat. 

Weapons provide either blunt, slashing, or piercing damage, and weapon classes have purpose. Similarly armor is best used against specific weapons when tactically viable. Additionally there are bows and crossbows. Each has pros and cons, bows can arc a shot, reload quicker, and provide more maneuverability, but are useless up close. Crossbows fire directly so a target may not be behind cover, and friendly fire is on. They also reload slower, but on the upside they cause higher damage and can be used at point blank once. Reloading is not possible while adjacent to a foe. The game also utilizes attacks of opportunity whenever you enter or leave an opponent's area of influence which is their hex and those immediately adjacent. This is Germanic fantasy DnD-Porn the game with hexes.

The management is a complex set of factors that any Mount and Blade fan will be comfortable with. You need: troops because they die horribly, food because they're growing boys, to maintain gear through repair with tools to stop your mercs from dying horribly, to rest and recover injuries with medical supplies after battles for those who didn't die horribly, and to maintain enough revenue to pay and outfit your troops so they can someday die horribly. All of these factors affect troop morale, a mercenary with a varied diet, consistent pay, and good leadership will be in a better mood than a starving merc who can't count on pay and is lead astray both in battle and out.

You can loot enemy equipment, assuming it wasn't destroyed. This will help offset the cost throughout the game, but often the equipment will be damaged from battle and require maintenance. Maintenance is performed while your company marches at a slow pace or at an accelerated pace while camping. Additionally you may pay blacksmiths and vendors to repair gear if you are in a pinch or swimming in gold. Some equipment, such as Greenskin gear has limitations since humans are not as strong as Greenskins, so they are unwieldy and have negatives, commonly paired with very high damage as a trade-off.

There are also short but dynamic and enjoyable roleplay moments, where your choices directly impact your troops morale, and well-being. There isn't a narrative per se but your purpose isn't constant, nor is your allegiance. You follow work around the map earning where you can. Sometimes it's clean work, escort a package. Sometimes it's dirty, clear the undead.

94,30679310,english,"This is a pretty fun game, it's got perma death, encourages/allows/rewards selective firings of those maimed and mutilated in your service, has swingy combat RNG (with a few ways to mitigate it) and a largely uncaring procedurally generated world.  These are the things that make it fun, everyone you meet is terrible (including the wasted lives you recruit to fill your spear line) as it's a campy but grim game about running a low fantasy mercenary company with tactical battles, resource managment, light RPG elements and a large variety of text based events that are quite flavorful.

There's not much flashy about Battle Brothers, and it doesn't really play to the common sorts of gamer power fantasies of wrecking foes and dominating the game with flashy graphical effects that prove one’s eliteness.  It’s a single player game about muddy bloody fantasy medieval combat and scared lumpy faced hoodlums turned mercenary who make money out of murdering people and things, but will spend most of that money on goat cheese, parched grain and boar spears.  If the grim struggle of a gibberish speaking wildman, cannibal butcher and militia deserter to surround and murder the last member of a bandit gang by stabbing him in the face with knives (as opposed to axes, swords, spears) to keep his rusty chainmail shirt intact for their future use sounds appealing this game will work for you.  If you want to fight dragons and do epic deed is will not.

The mechanics are simple hexed and turned based combat, supported by intense inventory management and some tactics (walls of stabby spearmen with pikes behind can work).  The graphics are charming, but static and the obvious work of love by one artist.  There’s nice music and decent writing, and the game world is minimally evocative low fantasy and seemingly rather German.  Interestingly while the game largely depends on the use of procedural generation to create narrative, there’s a big variety of events so it hangs together rather well and allows a person with even the sligthest amount of imagination to find a story among the contionous and somewhat repetative tactical battles.",1490239484,1490239484,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True,76561198033866805,177,11,10614,0,5026,1562638290,,

Town's militia joins you in the battle.
They run ahead of your heavily armoured soldiers.
Enemy is an undead legion, marching in formation, with a shieldwall.
I break formation to attempt to lend a hand.
Militia dies on first encounter, died in one hit.
My men cut down the skeletons in one or two hits each.
Dead militia rises as a zombie.
His friends are forced to cut him down, as their morale plummets.
One militia kills a skeleton.
He dies to the next.
Battle is won, as the final skeleton is surrounded and battered from all sides.
The siege continues, and my job is not complete.

Fuck, I thought that battle was way too easy.

Attacked in the middle of the night. My men are blind to the undead advance.
Scouts report there are only eight, but those we see are far better equipped than the last.
My archers can barely see in the dark, and the militia do another vain attempt at charging the undead.
These undead as we now see, have stronger shields, undamaged swords, and long pikes.
My men charge forward, and we surround the undead. 18 of us, eight of them.
A pity six of those are untrained, and barely tested militia who do not play smart.

I hate militia, they're so stupid.
Exactly why I never hire them.

The first Ancient Legionary to fall is thanks to my sergeant, Eberold, who I've had since the beginning.
The second to Torheim the Lucky, a miner from the north.
Two militia die, one slain by a blade, the other impaled by a pike.
A third legionary dies, as does a third militia.
The only militia with any brains are the ones with billhooks or pikes, as they stand behind my men, and attack from range.
Another dies to Torheim the Lucky!
Eberold takes a second skeletal legionary.
Harald the Cultist takes one down, strange for one who should be worshipping them.
A MILITIA KILLS A LEGIONARY! It's the one with a hooked pole. The only smart one.
One legionary left, and the battle is done.
Taken down by Meinholf the Witch Hunter.

The sun rises in the East, and the bell tolls announcing the third and hopefully final assault.
I barely make it to the market to offload some of the loot we have taken from the dead legionaries.
I also spend this brief moment to re-equip my men. Turns out, the Legionaries had better helmets than some of my men.

Twelve undead, three militia, and twelve mercenaries (us) in the final assault.
Two Auxiliaries, and ten Legionaries. This will be a long battle.

I realise only now, that one of my men has been fighting with a punctured hand.
Three battles, and not a single complaint. Jost really must enjoy mercenary life.
I truly wonder how bad fishing was, for him to be willing to fight hordes of undead, with a hole in his hand...

This time around, my men don't wait for the militia to charge, they just run straight into the fray.
Upon contact with the horde, our shields clash with theirs. One of the militia, who holds a pike, takes out a weak Auxiliary. A second enters the small gap created.
He is now surrounded by four skeletons.

His spear and petty buckler are no match for undead.
The spear just passes through their ribs.
Astoundingly he blocks three of the five attacks with that buckler. But he is still going to die.
My men valiantly fought to buy his freedom, but to no avail. The poor idiot died surrounded by the bones of those my allies had slain.

Harald the Cultist has to pull back, as his armour breaks apart, and his helmet falls from his head.
Jost the Fisher's armour also falls apart. He did well despite the gaping hole in his hand.
Raids throughout the night has done some real damage to the armour and morale of my men, I pray this is the last raid.
One of the militia, wearing only a padded tunic, and holding a shortsword, slew a legionary! I am astounded.
Alas, he is slain by a legionary.

The final Legionary is slain by Torheim the Lucky. He lives up to his name.

The siege is over, and the day is won.
The women weep for their fallen fathers, husbands, and sons.

18,30190985,english,"I have owned Battle Brothers for quite some now, played over 200 hours, and with the title in final beta, readying for release, the time has come to write a review:

Had the Brothers Grimm created a fantasy RPG instead of writing dark fairy tales, Battles Brothers would likely have been the result.  Fitting, actually, as the Battle Brothers dev team, as did the Grimm brothers, hail from Germany.   Battle Brothers takes you inside medieval life and shows you both the good and bad of living by your sword.  

In Battle Brothers, you lead your troop of up to 20 mercanaries (only 12 can fight at a time) back and forth across a beautifully hand rendered map, seeking employment by local nobles and businessmen in a time honored exchange of services:  your swords for their money.  Side elements allow small amounts of speculative trading of goods.  

You start the game with 3 men.  Most towns and villages you encounter have several men for hire.  Backgrounds of recruits vary, affecting both their initial capabilites and impacting what events may randomly occur as the game progresses.  It isn't every game that makes you WANT to find a cripple for hire because you need a few men for cheap.   

In Battle Brothers, the thrill of combat is real.  So is the pain and suffering it can impose upon the unskilled or unlucky. The joy of gaining experience and levelling one of your mercenaries is countered in one fell swoop of an enemy axe, permanently blinding one of your men and forcing you to make a huge - and heartfelt -  decison:  do I accept the lowered combat ability inflicted by the loss of his eye or do I cast aside his loyalty to the troop and previous prowess in combat, set him adrift, and hire a potentially more capable fighter in his stead?  The answer may seem obvious - you kick him to the dirt curb and hire a bettter man - but after he has been in your troop for days, saved your butt 4-5 times, and from time to time produces a sweet leather armor out of direwolf pelts, you may well find yourself succumbing to sentiment and retaining him. Such is the power of the game to immerse you beyond a facade of pixelated warriors into a realm of YOUR men; sweating, fighting, cursing, laughing, bleeding,..dying at your side.

As your sometimes merry, sometimes POd, and sometimes apathetic band of men travel from job to job, they gain experience (if they live long enough), allowing you to assign them new skills and abilities as they grow.  Classes, per se, do not exist.  Any merc can perform any function on the team, but that doesn't mean they should.  The skill, ability, ands equipment choices you make have a huge impact on how your men fight both individually and as a unit.  

Now, I know most rpg type games say this even though the truth is choices in many games impact how you play very little.   Choices in Battle Brothers definitely make their presence known!  Weapons have unique abilites and applications.  Specific skills change what you can and can not do efficiently.  

Weapon choices make a difference, skill choices make a difference, tactical choices make a difference.  Try to fight Goblins the same way you fight Bandits and you will find yourself hiring a bunch of new men. Some opponents are best played sitting back and sniping with your ranged troops before engaging.  Other oppoenents will carve their initials in your armor as you fall unless you rush to close with them as soon as the battle begins. Others are so mobile, you just hope you can adjust as they shift around the battelfield.   Get cocky and take on Greenskins (Orcs) before you are ready and you will find yourself starting a new game. 

Battle Brothers never lets you get comfortable with your men.  It demands you keep some flexibility on your team.  Orient it too far in one direction and fate will demand payment for your poor leadsership skills.

And just when you think  you have the game figured out, in comes a curveball, messing with your mind.  You can choose to rip off your employer.   You can go rogue and fight peasants or caravans.  You can flaunt your power and pick off patrols.  But beware, local nobles will not appreciate mercs out there stomping on their serfs, trade goods, and security forces.    You might want to think twice before enraging the only noble who has kennels on his lands; those war dogs can be great force multipliers!

I haven't even mentioned the need to maintain adequate supplies of money, food, arrows, bolts, and medical supplies.  Logistics are a light but important facet; one you must constantly watch and address if you wish to succeed.

I have seen some reviewers struggle to find another game this compares to; a failed quest, as Battle Brothers is a unique endeavor.  Were I pressed hard on the issue, I would say Battle Brothers most closely reminds me of Mount & Blade with a fantasy side and no horses.  They are closely enough aligned that if you liked Mount & Blades, you will most likely enjoy the heck out of Battle Brothers, as well.

But Battle Brothers is more what Mount & Blade would be after a demented Court Jester took it deep into the donjon for a few hours of torture.   The polish would remain albeit now coupled with a luster of dark humor, non-politcally correct content (for example, you can place wagers on your war dogs in dog fights), and language and events that skillfully teeter on the edge of going a bit too far for a family approved game without ever crossing the line.

And that, I think, it why this game succeeds so well.  It acknowledges the brutality of combat and hardness of life in medieval times without ever becoming too overbearing.  It is a game for people who don't like participation awards.  It makes you earn your rewards.  The artwork is outstanding, the stories are fantastic, and the gameplay is solid, challenging, and varied enough to keep you logged in for one more battle hours after you should have gone to bed.

22,30578295,english,"A fantastic strategy game. Excellent, engaging gameplay focusing around 2 different aspects: building / managing your mercenary band - hiring, maintaining, equipping and finding work for a group of murderous thugs - and actually doing battles (which are turn based on an isometric grid). In some ways similar to games such as XCOM. I have played for hours but still feel like I have things to learn.

The game has a decent sense of (slightly morbid) humour which can be seen in events and flavour texts, which is always nice, and although things aren't quite historically accurate (sure there's orcs and undead and stuff, but you know what I mean...) it does have a feel of historical plausibility to it which is a plus if you're interested in medieval history.

Graphics are simplistic but do a great job of communicating useful information and have a very pleasing consistent style. Music does its job and they recently added several more tracks giving some much-needed variety.

Only things I can say I dislike are lack of a 'respec' option (at cost obviously) for your mercenaries - which discourages experimenting with different abilities - and the fact that late game fights can get a bit samey because it's usually you vs. a gigantic horde of weaker enemies (with a few 'bosses' behind them but you're usually outnumbered 3:1).",1489789327,1489789327,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True,76561197962886238,94,6,13856,0,10851,1560796233,,

The game's great qualities are a superb combat system and an excellent character background and development system.

The game features several scenarios and an open world campaign mode with 25+ different enemies, 280+ items, 49 character perks and thousands of procedurally generated mercenaries for hire.

Your mercenary company can have up to 20 mercenaries of which 12 can participate in combat (wounded mercenaries need time to heal). Each mercenary can ""equip"" a wardog that can join a combat at the mercenary's discretion, whereupon the A.I. controls the wardog for the remainder of the combat.

Mercenaries have an experience level between 1 and 11. All hireable mercenaries have a background profession which may give them permanent stat modifiers and may determine the equipment that they come with.

Combat takes place on a hex grid. Combatants have their turn determined by an Initiative queue, and combatants can delay their turn. Actions consume APs (action points) and Fatigue Points.

Blunt weapons are capable of stunning opponents for 1 round. Slashing weapons are capable of causing opponents to bleed for a few rounds. Axes are capable of damaging and/or destroying shields. Mercenaries wielding shields are capable of setting shieldwalls. Mercenaries wielding spears are capable of setting spearwalls.

There are 3 types of armour: body armour, head armour, and shields. Each of these types of armour can be destroyed if they take enough damage equal to or greater than their Armour Rating.

Opponents include humans (including bandits and knights), orcs (including berserkers and warlords), goblins (including shamen), direwolves, undead (including ghouls, geists, and fallen heroes), necromancers, necrosavants, ancient priests, and ancient honor guards.

Combat is brutally lethal. Expect some of your mercenaries to die, especially early on in the game when your mercenaries have very poor armour.

You can choose to play the game as good mercenaries who kill bandits and monsters, or you can choose to play the game as evil mercenaries who attack trade caravans (in which case, expect to eventually be hunted down by the regional lord's soldiers and knights).

I have been playing this game in Ironman mode and I am loving the experience so much.

If you do play this game, then I strongly recommend that you play the game on the easiest difficulty setting because I first played this game on the middle (Veteran) difficulty setting and my mercenary company was wiped out by an orc raiding party.

49,30467043,english,"Just a warning ahead:
The game is HARD. Don't get attached to your mercenaries, because many of them will die a very horrible death. Combat is brutal, a hit that penetrates armor (if you're lucky enough to have anything worth the name) is likely to cause persistent wounds. 

So that warning out of the way, is the game worth buying? ABSOLUTELY!
It is one of the few RPG/Tactical Fantasy Wargames where the individual weapons truly matter.

Just some stuff the game considers:
Shields give a big defense boost. A battle line using a shield wall is hard to penetrate. A fighter with a shield can easily block arrows and strikes from swords. But flails ignore shield bonuses and axes can be use to destroy shields. Each weapons has different stats for armor penetration and damage to armor.

Troop morale matters. A lot. Soldiers seeing their comrades die will lose morale and eventually run. On both sides. Do you take out the strong enemy first? Or maybe it is better to quickly finish off the weak, so overall morale goes down? It's a question worth asking in every encounter (except, of course, against Undead).

Armor matters. A lot. Armor effectively gives the wearer a different set of hitpoint which is reduced before health damage occurs (though weapons do a % of penetrating damage). So vs highly armored enemies, hammers are a good weapon because they're designed to do more armor damage than other weapons. But heavy armor slows your soldiers down, they get fatigued more quickly and then cannot use their attack maneuvers.

The whole combat is rounded off with some RPG elements in that you can level your troops, increase their stats and unlock ""perks"" - special skills or maneuvers that may well make the difference for survival.

There are also some light fantasy elements. There are undead, monsters and orcs and goblins. But no mages throwing fireballs and stuff. And no healing spells either. This is a brutal, gritty flesh and blood type of battle that immerses you in small scale conflicts in the middle ages. It's also well written.

I could not recommend this game more. I've been playing it for over a year, and I've seen it transform from a buggy, frustrating mess, into a fully-fledged, balanced, *almost* polished game. This game really is a shining example of dev transparency and commitment, with weekly updates, or at least releases on what was in the works. It's rare that I recommend buying a game for anything more than ten dollars, but if you are truly a fan of permadeath, difficult strategy games, this is worth the money. Squad-scale Turn-Based Strategy at its finest.

PROS

-Excellent atmosphere

-Excellent sound design, from combat sound effects to ambience to music.

-Customizable, unique soldiers (Wolfgang the Relentless will live on in my heart). Soldiers start off with stats that are rooted in RNG, but are also affected by their background. So while I know a bowyer will have a higher ranged stat, only after I've hired him will I found whether he's dumb, shortsighted, incredibly brave, a drunkard, disloyal, etc. An ordinary fisherman I hired to fill the spot of a recently deceased shield bearer turned out to be incredibly skilled in melee combat, with higher hitpoints than I'd ever seen before, and a deathwish that literally prevented his resolve from breaking. And these soldiers are not set in stone after you hire them. Their interactions with other soldiers, as well as their experiences on the road and in battle will shape their skills and personalities. Edit: The final update added significantly more road events, making your brothers time with the company as important as their status when you recruit them.

-A smooth, deep combat system with clearly explained systems.

-Good macro-micro balance, decisions in combat affect worldmap strategy and vice versa.

-Lots of optional depth. Edit: What was once optional depth has become strongly encouraged depth, with additional optional depth. In short, more of what you want.

-Different strategies (see cons as well)

-Good enemy variety (Edit: Fantastic enemy variety as of the update), and different enemies have IMPORTANT differences, completely different strategies required to combat skeleton v. orcs v. goblins v. bandits v. noble forces, and even different party compositions within these factions force the player to think on their feet.

-Recently added named enemies provide yet more weight to the loosely patched together ""narrative"" that will form around your company.

-An almost Darkest Dungeon-esque permanent/temporary injury system. If a soldier receives a debilitating injury, not only do they lose hitpoints, they also lose stats. A grazed kidney halves the max hitpoints of your soldier, a pierced chest takes 20% of their fatigue, etc. Most of these injuries can be healed over the course of a few days, and heal faster if you put that soldier in reserve. 
      This system is possibly my favorite, as I feel like every aspect is important and carries weight. I can't just ignore the injury, but putting my well trained, heavily armored beserker in reserve right before fighting a team of orcs is equally risky. 
      In addition, when a soldier is ""killed"" (hits 0 hitpoints), they are out of combat, and usually are actually dead, but occasionally instead they receive a permanent disability. This serves to further the idea of each soldier being unique. 
        For example, Ulf the Undying -- one of my original three soldiers -- has three permanent disabilities, having been brained by an orc beserker, his nose chopped off by a wiederganger, and stabbed to death (then promptly resuscitated) by goblin wolfriders. His brain injury makes his dumb (levels up slower), but brave (+15 resolve). His chopped off nose makes his ingame sprite horrific to look at, and also breathe harder (-10% fatigue recovery). The tramautic experience of being surrounded by goblin wolfriders and stabbed to death has tramautized him (-40% initiative, -50% resolve). This soldier has been with the company from the very start, so he's leveled up many times and is very skilled. However, these disabilities force me to weigh the pros of keeping such an experienced soldier against the burden of cowardice and slow experience gains. 
         A fast and light skirmisher that gets a maimed foot (+1 AP required per tile moved) may be dismissed, or may instead find a new home as a shieldbearer who doesn't need to move that fast anyways. The injury system is a complex, well thought out way to keep the player on their toes.

-As of the update, three different late-game crises have been added for several reason; they keep enemies scaled to the players even deep into the lategame, they provide an interesting new problem that the player has not yet faced, and they allow the player to sculpt a far more epic story than that of a simple successful company.

PRO/CON

-If you're not playing on beginner, there's no nice way to put it. The game's fucking hard. Orc Warriors will kill your finest men without a second thought, your oldest, most grizzled soldier will catch a miracle arrow in the eye, and yes, goddamit, it's frustrating. But it's not unfair. Maybe once or twice in almost 100 hours of gameplay has something truly unfair and rigged happened to me. Every other time, it was my own damn fault for assuming the 2% shot wasn't going to land, or that SURELY the orc will miss. If you don't play it safe 100% of the time, the game WILL punish you. If you're not looking for that experience, either play on beginner or buy a different game.

CONS

-While I personally experiment with interesting party compositions to face different threats, 7 shield bearers with handaxes + 2 archers + 3 billhooks is pretty much unbeatable, and can be accomplished pretty early. EDIT: Not anymore, goblin ambushers will develop a five-step plan to gape your ass if you try to pull this slick move, the balance has moved strongly in favor of archers, but there isn't really a one party fits all 

-Very player centric world, only occasionally will combat happen without the player and significant world changes NEVER occur without player input.

-Very light structure, you have to go looking for adventure, the game often fails to lead you to it. Edit: Once again, the massive update provided an effective solution to this problem. The game continues to present you with a choice between three different ambitions, or short term goals to complete, to keep your party moving. Now, if you prefer light structure, you can neglect to choose ambitions, so it's really the best of both worlds.

Overall, the game is just a masterpiece. The classic XCOM feeling of valuing individual squad members, investing in them, and being unspeakable frustrated when a chrysalid opens their jugular in one go is perfectly emulated, I can remember the names and feats of many of my favorite soldiers. Deep, balanced, important systems keep the player constantly adjusting their strategy to meet ever increasing threats. This game does EXACTLY what it aims to do with laser precision, and that's all you can really ask for from a game like this.

Apparently, the full release price will be $30.00. If you're reading this review and its still in early access, buy now, save yourself money. On principle, I don't buy games that are $30.00. I would break that rule for this game. Not only have I poured hours into it, and gotten great value, when you buy this game, you are supporting the most pleasant, hard-working, ingenious devs I have ever interacted with. Think of it as a $20.00 game with a $10.00 tip for devs that absolutely deserve it. I wish every early access I supported had devs like this.

I bought this game on a whim as I was looking for a turn based game. I was not dissapointed. 

The RNG can be unforgiving at times but that is the beauty. You can rename and customize every part of your merry band. Each new recruit has  back story and previous profession. You get attached to these people...and they die. They all die horrible deaths. I love the injury system.

There are some similarities to Mount and Blade but theyare very minor. Mainly the overland map and the trading but they are still different. This is closer to X-Com where it is about your people. The turn based combat is very strategic but can be very unforgiving.

Combat is only a part of the game. You have to manage your men and thier injuries, moral, weapons, food, money, etc.

The devs have kept in constant contact with the community (since I purchased anyway) and updates, patches and balances are constantly happeing.

Hoggart the Weasel slaughters my entire team - have to restart and reload many many times to get lucky enough to make it through this battle without someone dying (and yes haters I use nets and I used terrain to my advantage however your inability to hit absolute dog shit at level 1 is such an immense burden you HAVE to get lucky)

3 Direwolves slaughter my entire company of 7.. which begs the question.. why the fuck are we fighting DIREWOLVES at level 1 barely lvl 2??   Own and everything is way too expensive.  I can barely keep my band fed, bandaged and set with tools after each mission I have no money to buy upgraded gear or hire skilled mercs..

You start off in a randomly generated world with a bunch of towns which are all different (have different buildings, charge different prices, etc) The game has initial direction (sort of like a tutorial mission and tips) and after that its up to you what you want to accomplish with your mercenary band. Just my opinion, but I would start by playing the game on easy to learn. Then once you learn the game, veteran ironman before taking on legendary ironman. Ironman can be frustrating but once you've played it, its hard to go back. 

The say that they will come out with end of game events, sort of like endings, in order to give the game some closure. If you just like fighting turn based RPG style battles, it's not really needed IMO. The best part about the game is your freedom to choose. You can just go on reking stuff for a long time before your company reaches GOD status. 

I've had the game for about a year (maybe more) now and am just getting around to writing the review. 

PROS: 

- Simple to learn. Gameplay and UI make it easy. Going from menu to menu is probably the best aspect of the UI. In some games, it wont let you access your inventory or see your party status without exiting certain screens but this game doesn't have that. It makes high frequency transactions easier to deal with. IE: selling, recruiting

- The art is pretty cool. Characters will change appearence based on the armor/weapons equipped as well as status (will look injured or bloody) The world map isnt fantastic from a terrain perspective, but its not a big deal. 

- Replayability is fairly high. You can't really go on autopilot when you play this game. Again, I play on legendary/ironman nowadays and if you take a bad mission things can escalate very quickly. Especially in the mid - late game. Even on veteran/ironman, you can't really lose focus or you'll end up losing a character or 2 every now and then. 

- Every battle has terrain and opposition nuances which make every battle a challenge. Makes tactical choices more interesting and important. Its easy to lose track of time just hopping from one contract to another. 

- Different weapons and fighting styles make the game interesting and have their own unique skils which means you can customize how you want to fight. For instance, spears can set up a spear wall. Swords have riposte. Axes can break shields. You can choose a two handed weapon with no shield, etc. 

- Hero customization is pretty cool. Can change appearence, give em nicknames, etc. Makes it hard when they die though. They also come with a set of pre-exisiting personality attributes which you can't change. You just have to use skill points to get around it. For example, being tiny decreases your melee attk but increases your def. Craven lowers their resolve, etc.  

CONS:

- Like all turn based RPGs, the RNG can drive you completely nuts. It helps a little bit if you learn adaptation and level up your heroes, but when you miss several 70%+ attks in a row, it can get pretty annoying. Worst I've missed is I think a 91-92. But in the beginning, when your guys aren't that strong, you have to just play a bit more defensively and plan on missing the majority of your attacks.

- Losing people is awful and can be completely demoralizing. You get attached and you have to either pay alot for more advanced recruits or start off with a lvl 1 person. OR if you're not on ironman, reload from a savepoint. In the midgame, this process is completely brutal and can sometimes lead to the whole company getting rekt if you have too many low lvl people and take a bad contract. 

- Can't see enemy movement possibilities. Some games have this, some games don't. But you can't see where the enemy can move to. After you play for awhile, you'll sort of know. But I have almost 100 hours on the game and eneimes can still surprise me and move into a hex I didn't think they could reach. 

- I wish they had battle classes. There are no healers and no magic. Its more of a gritty fantasy based game. True, you could just skill characters up to sort of mirror classes. (IE: train weapon mastery) and before they are recruited they come with previous jobs which give them pre-exisiting attributes. (IE: farmhands have more fatigue and HP) but it would still be cool to make someone a knight or a lancer, etc. Best you can do is just give them bad a$$ armor and weapons, then rename them to ""SIR"" or add ""THE LANCER"". 

- Game has been in early access for awhile and I would play more but I'm just waiting for this final patch to go through which is taking forever. I understand that they want to get it right but the game has been in early access for about 2 years now and its time to finish it up. 

CONCLUSION: 
Would definitely recommend this game, especially now. Its almost complete and there's not much fine tuning left. As I stated, if you love turn based RPGs, this is a great game. If you don't, you won't get as much out of it as I have. It doesn't have the art and animation of an Xcom but the gameplay is engaging and challenging. Anything they add in the final update will just be a cherry on top. I can't swear that any final changes they put in will NOT totally break the game, but look for posts after the final update goes in to make sure.",1488663207,1488668366,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,True,76561198009773591,70,22,20748,0,5797,1597803006,,

On the eve of launch, this game is ready for prime time. Watch your let's plays on youtube and decide for yourself. But don't watch too much. The devs have added some nice random events and decision points that should be enjoyed on your own.

As said below, this development team has been highly active and transparent with its community. The roadmap and timelines have been followed throughout the entire process. Whenever they've put out an update, any bugs found have been immediately squashed.

The art, sound, metagame, tactical combat, skill tree's, mercenary backgrounds, weapons, armor...everything has been improved and tweaked to make this game one of my favorite tactical point and click games.

They've listened to customer feedback and implemented many positive changes...this team really understands how games should be made with their audience in mind. 

It's highly enjoyable and stable before launch. They're just polishing and tweaking the balance in certain areas. Well worth twenty bucks folks. If you like tactical, team-oriented, turn based combat with light economy management and a world map that changes based on your action or inaction...check this game out!


====================================================================
Man, this game is quickly shaping up to be a great turn-based strategy game with solid meta game mechanics. The devs provide regular updates, videos, and accept feedback (everything you would want from a developer and a game in early access). 

In less than a year, they have made major improvements to a game that started out as a quirky turn-based combat game. Definitely worth the 20 bucks I spent (maybe even less, as I think I may have picked it up on sale). Check out some videos to see if its mechanics work for you. 

+regular updates; great communication from developers about the ever changing state of the game
+nice battle mechanics: high-ground, terrain, fatigue
+fleshed out over-world map; even in it's early access state
+quirky battle animations and characters (as you suffer blows in combat, your characters get nicked, scratched and can be beheaded. Also, some cool back stories and achetypes, suitable for the mercenary company you are building.

It is squad-based RNG festival

And most problmatic thing is that it is RNG with [b]*huge variances.[/b]

Let me show you how random this game can be

-Randomness in Battle
[spoiler]
Damage range of most weapon are too wide. *Militia spear has dmg of 20-35 and hitting head(which is RNG) causes additional dmg.
+
HP system of this game makes 'acutal health' as a random number, there are head/body armor and health.
Each armor acts as additional health to corresponding part.

This makes actual health of unit vary between (head armor+health)~(head armor+body armor+health)
+
Your boy can attack up to 2 times per turn, and any movement or using 2-handed weapon will reduce that to one.
And only one or two hit from two-handed weapon can kill light to medium armored unit.

Which makes number of dice throwing too small to compansate overall randomness.
+
Surrounding enemey is not that viable tactics, it only increases hit chances by 5% per surrounding units, so praying to your god or godness works better
+
Spearwall, one of few viable tactics you can use in early game, are purely based on RNG.
Literally your guy can 'fuckk off' endlessly chraging 4 guys and save the day, or can be disabled by single enemy with his first movement.
[/spoiler]
To put it simple,
Hp is random, dmg is random, hit chace is random. number of attack is too small to compansate all that randomness.
Wheter your tactics works or not is random and you can do nothing about it.

-Randomness before battle
[spoiler]
Progression is BS, initial ability matters too much, cause it vary too much and level up increases only small amounts
(and amount of increases is RNG, again)
which makes it entirely possible to have high level unit weaker than level 1 recurit  
+
missions have really really random amounts of reward
you can have escort mission that give u 1k money and no one attacks you during whole travel.
or you can have esscort mission that give u 300 and get totally rekt by overpowered enemys

and it looks like devs made this intentionally, cause in tooltip they says things like 'not every mission is worth the rewards'

yeah that is kinda of realistic, but you have no way of knowing or avoiding unitil u get reckt hard, cause game punish the shit outta of choosing 'Retreat' option.
[/spoiler]
simply, ability of units are random, difficulty of mission is random, rewards are random, and you can not 'tatically retreat' cause pressing 'retreat' button will instantly injures everyone of your squad.


If you consider 'RPG' part as selling points, still this is not the one for you, cause perk systm and equipment upgrades are joke.

Most perks are useless, you are going to build every characters same.
there are not much meaning in high tier gears, cause it only increases numbers, with no unique property.

Some says Darkest dungeon is too RNG, but this one is worse.

1,30216185,english,"When PC games were young there were a run of games on the PC and Amiga where you would travel across a randomly generated land using WASD to try and build an army to defeat some great enemy and free the kingdom. They used ASCII for the terrain and you simply had numbers for your army size, food and equipment. Battle Brothers is the modern epitome of these classic games, and when finished, based on how it is going so far, has the potential to sit along side epic games like FTL in that, no matter how many times you have played them, you will occasionally dust it off once again and have another game to see what happens and where it goes.  

So far I haven't quite figured out what the end goal of Battle Brothers is or even if it does in fact have one, the story line is very thin leaving you with a lot of autonomy to do your own thing.  What I do know however is that I have had more fun playing this game, running quests and kitting out my mercs to fit my preferred fighting style than I have had with many mainstream games that cost 3 times the price.

As for the actual game, it's a little like a medieval X-Com, you don't build a base (or a least I don't think so), or have a scripted story line  (or a least I don't think so), but you build up your little mercenary company from almost nothing taking contracts to get better gear (either from battlefield loot or from merchants in town) taking on greater and greater challenges and occasionally going your own way to raid a stronghold or ancient burial ground just because you can.

Combat is brutal and vicious and bloody, and often you lose some of your finest mercs with your best gear and take two steps back for one step forward. This isn't a game where you leave every fight with your team alive.  Also recently added, merchants and tailors and other pre-merc skills of your band can help if you add them to your camp or battle line, opening additional quest lines or getting bargains on special items etc.

Overall this is a fantastic game, and if you like strategy games using small squads on a hex map, this is a must have game for your collection.

1) Absurd camera controls and most absurd part, you can't disable it in config, it have ""always focus AI movent setting"" but it will move camera around ever if you disabled it.
Basically, you can't use archers, you will be forced to reposition camera after every god damned turn of any creature on field.
Also camera controls are locked on AI turn for no good reason.
Instead of watching essential units you will enjoy camera jumping around.

2) Absolutely completely random driven, it does not actually matter, how well you play, few bad rolls will ruin you completely.
Archer that missed 10 times in row with 75% hit rate is normal case.
Ghould that oneshot someone each turn and nothing you can do also absolutely normal.
Orcs with 20% chance to kill anyone in single strike no matter armor and skills.

3) I don't know for what reason developers ""close"" all stores at towns at night, probably you will enjoy waiting them to open doing nothing.

5) Party is random, you can't get any information about characters before paying them, also few very harmful perks not explained clearly and you may hit very frustrating situations.

6) Loot is random and you are not getting armor from dead bodies, you can if killed someone before destroying armor, but this is not explained anywhere in game.

28,30131291,english,"I've been following Battle Brothers since before it received the GreenLight in October 2014. Man, that's quite some time. At that time I was looking for some sandboxy type of game that allowed us to grab some medieval weapons and fight our way through hordes of enemies in a turn based game, with management features and some sort of procedural story telling. 

Guess what: that's precisely what Battle Brothers is!

So I've found this game on ModDB.com and thought: ""Nah, it's too good to be true, there's no way they would manage to release that"". But, disregarding my predictions (and also to my delight), they're now just a few weeks from releasing the full version while managing to keep almost all the features they've promised. Not all, unfortunately, because of the tight budget they had to deal with (things like battles inside dungeons, ruins, sieges, etc., were left for a later moment, for example). Even so, it has been very rewarding for me to watch the Battle Brothers' development through the blog posts, which I started following some time before the Public Pre-Alpha Combat Demo release way back, and see the game coming to life little by little.

For anyone wanting to try a Sandbox Turn Based RPG with a medieval theme, deep tactics, procedural events and the harsh atmosphere of a mercenary life (which's something Battle Brothers captures really well), I assure you that this is your type of game, which is also made by one of the most transparent and communicative devs I've ever seen.",1487899975,1487899975,True,14,0,0.518892526626586914,0,True,False,True,76561198080482844,63,1,3646,0,1944,1594005533,,

That doesn't seem like a long time, but seven days ago Hilderich was a founder of the Poor Sods mercenary company, an axe weiding terror who once beheaded three men in one battle, but this morning, he's a rotting corpse with his skull split down the middle. Anton the Brave, he's now Anton the deceased. Good ol' Bjarne, a beggar who signed on for a chance at something better was gutted and bled out as he begged for just one more breath. Steinar fared no better, his blonde head was cleaved from his sturdy farmhand shoulders. That's a lot of blood for one week.

Who knows, maybe the dead are the lucky ones. The rest of us knit our busted bones and stitch severed muscles nearly starving on a gray paste of grain and water. Of course some wounds can't be fixed with bandages and a bowl of gruel, poor Robert the Juggler took a pick to the head that scrambled his eggs and hasn't been the same since.

The rest: a brain-damaged juggler, a gravedigger drunkard, a fisherman, an apprentice of questionable loyalty and a cripple with no ears. Our gear is the broken bits we scavenge from the bodies of our enemies, or post-mortem hand me downs from our own fallen brothers.

But despite our dearth of battle-ready fighters and our rummage sale gear, we've somehow got another contract. Another benefactor with clean skin and white clothes who'll pay our rusty asses 400 crowns to murder some nearby inconvenient thugs. 

My share of the 400 isn't enough to get me out, but maybe they've a cache of gold to loot, or captured princess to rescue.

It hits the nail on the head, positioning itself as a tactical, turn-based battler with rpg elements for each of your soldiers. The game gives you wide leeway to play it anywhere from a permadeath experience to constantly scum saving your band of brothers for a better outcome. 

The only saves I go back to are battles I lost and want to learn from. While permadeath may be good for veterans of the game, getting to replay battles is what makes the game for me as I get to learn what tactics are needed to defeat swarms of undead versus ogres versus goblins, etc. Unlike a game like HoMM3, tactics really count in this game if you want to survive. Sure many enemies can be picked off with a basic defensive frontline of spearmen and back line of crossbow wielders, but whatever your favorite go-to tactics are, there will be some groups of enemies that require you to adjust or continue to be defeated by them.

I suppose I could ramble on as this isn't a particularly structured review, but in an attempt to keep this brief, let me just say this game really gets me with that whole one more battle thing. I also enjoy the party management element of the game too and don't find it getting tedious after having put in 80 hours of game play so far.

Genuinely one of the best and most replayable games I have played in many, many years

The simplicity means game mechanics actually work, yet there are layers and layers of depth

The procedurally generated map makes starting again, after dying, again, feel fresh.

For somewhat basic 2d characters many turn out to be endearing, some indispensable - unfortunately the game disagrees. Genuinely varied stats affected by traits or disabilities and a well thought out skill tree mean that men can be honed to fit some role in whatever strategy you can best manage.

On track to become a Strategy/Survival/RPG game of the year contender!! A FIVE STAR masterpiece! 

If you love turn based strategy games, get this game. 
If you love surival games, get this game!
If you love turn based RPG's, get this game!
If you love medival warefare, get this game!
If you love exploration and adventure, get this game!
If you love naming your characters, gearing them up, leveling them and upgrading their skills/perks, get this game!!!

Additions I'd love to see once this game is fully released:
- On the party screen, it would be nice to have a number at the bottom of each of my characters that represents his level, so i can see it at a glance. 
- More weather effects in battles (wind, rain, sleet, snow, hail, fog, duststorm); and weather effects on the map as well which may trigger special events from time to time, but associated with the weather if that makes sense. 
- Mounts for my characters in battles (e.g. wolf mounts, horses, elephants, big cats or lion, panther)
- A mount (faster movement option) on the map itself
- Fire Arrows, exploding arrows, acid arrows, sharper arrows, but keep it realistic of course
- The writing in the quests is good, but have you considered adding choices that have consequences to the quests and NPC interactions? THis would add an entire new level of depth to this game. 
- Duel wielding of daggers, small axes, small swords. 
- Add a rouge skill that allows concealment that can be acquired at level 2 or 3. 
- Add pet eagles or hawks as another pet option

77,29770547,english,"It feels as though the reviews here were doctored. I have too many complaints for this game.

Gameplay:

The gameplay mirrors Mount and Warblade but lacks even more substance. Towns only differ in the type of standard buildings they possess. One might have an armorsmith but not a weaponsmith, etc.The tavern in towns offers the only semblance of uniqueness to the towns, but the ""rumors"" are useless aside from identifying quest locations.

Speaking of quests, the entire game revolves around contracts, which are just quests. The quests are merely (1) deliver this package, (2) kill things, or (3) deliver a package while kiling things. Contracts are not only repetitive in action, they offer the same text-based dialogue. Within a couple hours I was legit repeating the same contracts with the exact same mission and text. Embarassing.


Aside from doing contracts, the game centers around army management which consists of using provisions over time (food, gold, medicine, repair items, and ammunition), There are occasional text prompts for your characters which is a random choice for no reason with no discernable coorelation with anything. For example, before I quit playing a party member refused to eat and I could either (1) offer food or (2) leave him alone, I took the time to offer food so he didn't pass out and he gained the negative trait ""concerned."" Just a totally random and unimaginative interaction.

Speaking of random, your characters are entirely random. You recruit people from towns and have no idea what their actual stats are. Based on their background (i.e. fisherman), you'll know that the character has higher hp or higher ranged attack - that's it. In large part, it doesn't matter because characters have no ""class"" like in other RPGS. Character abilities are determined solely by the items you equip. Simply change out shield and spear for a two hand battle ax, no problem. The sole customization in the game is limited to perks you gain each level (no complaints on that actually) and how you distribute points to various statistics. Each level your character rolls for each trait and you pick the top 3 rolls you want.

As to these ""statistics,"" they are horribly basic. You have health, fatigue (how many times you attack), resolve (chance to flee, etc.), intiative (first action), melee attack, range attack, melee defese, range defense, and that's it. An even bigger issue with these barren stats is how they have no clear coorelation to combat itself.

Combat:

It's as bare bones as you can get. Same old tactical formations that have existed since Shining Force. The only information you get in selecting your attack is that certain things give a + rating to hit or a - rating to hit. Thats it. You have no idea what stats the opposition has. No idea how your stats impact the attack, The combat dialogue is a joke. It is barely visible text and tells you nothing. You learn what damage you took, that's it. No idea about rolls, nothing. Coming from Darkest Dungeon, this is unfathomable. The entirety of the game centers around tactical turn based combat and you're given damage done and percent to hit as the only things to help you make decisions in battle. You'll get one shot by an enemy and have no idea why.

Combat is also a total crapshoot. The game gives you no idea what the strength of the enemy is before a battle. It tells you the amount of a certain troop and that's it. The troop could be mega strong or mega weak. Same applies with quests. You're given a 1-3 skull difficulty bar, but have no idea what that encompasses. You're forced to walk in blindly.

Speaking of walking in blindly, my level 3 guys had just won a battle when (5) undead attacked them randomly. The 5 undead were vampires that wiped my party. Why was there a group of undead attacking me? No idea. But I shouldn't have unwinnable battles thrust upon me to ruin progress. Strategy is about preparation and problem solving. These encounters are haphazard and serve as a an unavoidable hamstring for no reason.

The itemization is boring and weak. Basic armor, basic weapons...nothing unique to items. In a text based game with no graphical qualities, you should at least have exciting loot prospects.

There are factions in the game based on how you perform in quests but I did not see any purpose for it (maybe you get a discount or something).

There are random caravans on the road but, unlike Mount and Warblade, you cannot interact with them. The ""open world"" is procedurally generated cities and bland contracts on repeat. There are random outposts in the game, but it leads to a fight and I'd imagine you just get standard loot if you don't wipe from an unknown hoard. Why would I enter a battle with absolutely no knowledge of the enemy in a game with permadeath?

Visual:

The art is weak. As in far weaker than Shining Force weak, which seems odd for a 2017 EA game. Sound follows suit. There is no voice acting - just generic background effect noise and music. There are no animations. There is no lore, nothing exciting about the world. 

Ultimately, the reviews made me buy this game. I came expecting something similar to Darkest Dungeon without the beautiful art and voice acting. What I received was a shallow, repetitive, and frustrating game that fakes difficulty with impossible encounters. DD has meaningful RNG that can be surmounted (I've beaten it on NG+)- this game legit fed my army to slaughter several times without me being able to counter anything. This is, for the most part, because the game simply does not have customization.

It may be of some importance to note that there's no actual tutorial for this game (sure, scenarios can teach you the different ways that enemies kill you, but they do not teach you how to be better at using the tactics at your disposal).

Similar in some ways to X-COM, permadeath is a main feature (I must admit though, that much more often in Battle Brothers I would admit to myself, ""I deserved that"" when one of my merc.'s head flew off).

The beginning is tough and you end up running away a lot. Your men get butchered left and right. You watch your supplies slowly deplete. You seem to never have enough money. But then you win a fight. You win another, then another. ""Wow"", you think, ""I'm actually getting the hang of this."" It starts to get dark so you make your way to the nearest city to unload the loot you've gathered and to resupply. 

You stay on the roads so you can quickly evade the terrors that hide in the darkness. It's dead of night by the time you catch a glimse of the laterns glowing dimly in the distance. Between you and a warm bed are a patch of woods. You've crossed it safely a number of times already and tonight should be no different. By the time you saw the footprints it was already too late. A pack of Direwolves descend upon your party. 

Your men are armed with axes and blunt weapons, ideal for battering shields and armor but near useless against agile beasts. You instantly regret leaving your spears packed neatly away. Life on the road isn't easy so you make the best you can with the best you've got. You order your men into formation so they form a shieldwall. 

Your archer, equipped with a light bow and leather armor, is unencumbered by chainmail and metal so he moves first. His visibility is limited by the darkness. He sees nothing so he walks a few paces past your forward line. He looks back at you calmly as if there was no danger, as if the rustling of leaves were nothing but the wind. For a moment you think maybe it was a false alarm. Maybe you could just walk away. 

His death was quick. There wasn't even a scream, just pure terror in his eyes. He was torn to pieces before anyone else had a chance to move. It was in that moment that you knew your rag tag band of farmhands and beggers just didn't stand a chance...

The game centers around your party of sellswords, who move around a world map between settlements and citidels to buy supplies and to get contracts to pay the bills. These jobs can be generally grouped into mob killing and going to other cities, which can get repetitive; but the engagements themselves  a bit of variety in terms of opponents as well as a general sense of progression as individual guys level up, gaining the strength (called fatigue in the game) to wear better armor and wield better weapons. 

For each mercenary that can be hired to (or join) your group there is an underlying background and trait system, as well as permanent injuries which can result instead of death when taking fatal damage in combat. There is also an experience and perk system which lets the player build each character according to his talents and abilities. These systems all work together to create a compelling game experience that invests the player in the plight of their fledgling mercenary band.

Combat is definitely fun and can be very punishing on the harder difficulties - you will come to fear any and all projectiles.
But the game is fair in the sense that each enemy follows certain rules and has it's own logic and intelligence. The game also provides the player with a variety of strategies through the various weapons available.

There is a rudimentary favor system based on completing quests for specific settlements or one of the three factions. This system allows the player to move and trade goods for profit as well creating the potential for interesting situations such as going hostile to a town and raiding it's caravans for loot.

As a simple example, I have learnt to fight goblin ambushers at night if at all possible, where the range and accuracy of their bows are reduced.

Do you plan to play the game with other people and will it be possible to play with other people to create the initial company? for example, you create six guys with a ""bad"" past (like a fisherman) with poor armor or weapons, or you can create one boundary of a knight with two-handed hammer and armor as the fallen heroes and with the stars in the right place at the skills.And how strong you will do will be measured for points that can be obtained for example for the achievements or for how and how much you played in a single game, in ""iron man"" for example or in a simple game. And these glasses are every time you want to create your company in the game with others?

It's really good--a tight concept and a devoted development team with a clear idea of what they want to accomplish.  The game is pretty unique, taking some cues from games like Darkest Dungeon with individual character stats and potential permadeath, but also tactical combat reminiscent of Heroes of Might and Magic et. al.  Bottom line is it's a fun game where winning or losing has interesting consequences.

Otherwise, the graphics provide a solid representation of what you're looking at with the appropriate amount of blood and gore as your soldiers are slaughtered.  The sound is good: slicing through an orc or an attack bouncing off their armor has an appropriate effect which I think even changes from weapon to weapon.  Gameplay is great--it's a delight customizing your fighting force and trying to strategize for how you'll approach different scenarios.

37,29216553,english,"I don't usually write reviews for games, however. This is an exception. This'll be a short review.
This game is a perfect example of early access gone right, the developers know what they are doing.

Gameplay - 
At first, you may be overwhelmed by the UI but it is easy to learn the mechanics of the game. The main idea of Battle Brothers is that you run a medieval mercenary company, you hire your men and feed them, train them, and fight with them. Once you establish yourself well enough you may purchase more equipment such as weapons and armor from cities and towns. 
The quests in the game can be somewhat repetitive but is an easy makeup for every battle is not the same as the last. You will be taking long patrols to hunt down those terrorizing the roads of the realm, or prehaps to disperse that group of orcs taking up hold in the fortress in the woods. 

Graphics - 
While being a 2D game, the visuals are very appeasing to the eye and contrast well for the timeline. Armours and weapons are diverse and different from the last and the combat is one of the most satisfying moments in the game. The world map looks very nice and colourful while also looking grim. 

Combat -
The combat in Battle Brothers is among one of the most satisfying i have ever experienced in a turn-based strategy game since X-Com. Will you poke as many holes as you can in your enemy with a Boar Spear? Or prehaps make heads roll with that mighty greatsword you just got your lad Fernidand after stopping for some drinks? 
The game is hard. That is farely evident. You will win some and you will lose some. The AI is very good and fairly unpredictable, making every encounter possibly one of your last. 

Soundtrack - 
The soundtrack fits the game amazingly well. The combat themes are one of my favorites and the instruments perfectly fit the dire situations you will experience while playing Battle Brothers.

I spent 20$ on this game in hopes for something unique, however what i got out of it was enjoyment worth 40$. I will be playing more of Battle Brothers in the future. 
You need to buy this now, Its 20$, 20$!!! This is basically a steal.

39,29192079,english,"Gamplay review:
The game is great, I love the combat mechanics and the depth of the strategy although it seems like there is just a few clear paths to victorey at this point. Its hard to say how many different combat tactics you can employ with success. The maps are decent but the camera angle is below average. The trrain system and how it is implemented is poor, because its hard to differentiate between some high or low areas because of the camera and difficult terrain also is hard to spot so you may find a fighter in a vulnerable spot thanks to difficult terrain that looks normal. I think the implementation of a 360 degree camera would fix all of that. All in all though this game has been a very positive experience.

Dev Suggestions:
It makes sense that this game in early-access because the players give a lot of criticism both helpful and not. The Devs listen and implement the things they like. What I would really like to see is a deep class system. Maybe even a class tree that opens up skills and causes some hinderances. You have chosen for this fisherman, to take up a spearman's job? Excellent, he has the option of eventually becoming a pikeman, or someone specialized in fighting mounted combatants. Mounted combat would also be fantastic.

Combat can seem barebones, but the tension on each turn, the stories created, the preperation before keeps me looking for the next contract, and the next, and the next. 
I recommend this game to anyone who enjoyed both Xcom and Mount and blade, but it's early access so i'll use this review to nitpick. 

The game is lacking an overall goal. As of this review there is no way to 'beat' the game, you can create your own win condition and just keep going. 
Initially character backstories and contracts are fun and interesting but then you see the same dialogue and same story again again which can break immersion. 
There isn't complete freedom in what you want you merc company to do; you can't raid caravans, you can't attack cities, you're stuck with just accepting a contract, either complete it or not, move on. 
Maps are randomly generated which is good, but can be lacking in some things because of that. My main campaign was missing a fletcher (Ranged store). 

I enjoyed this game and am stopping myself from playing more so I can enjoy the full version before i'm burnt out.

Glory? Nope. 
Honour? Of a sorts. 
Hard choices? Plenty.
Death in every corner? Defenitely.
Make your own ideal characters? In your dreams.

Let's elaborate a bit and point out the good in this game.

The mood. This game delivers what it promises (and that already in early acess!) A low power fantasy world where ten man are a force to keep an eye on and a hundred an army. The descriptions of quests and events really fit this mood and remain at all times in that mood. Yes, there is comic relief but it doesn't break immersion at all. It only furthers it more.

The details. There are so many things to keep track of. Food, supplies, the wounds of your men, your weapons and armor and yet it never feels like a chore or even anything but enjoyable. I don't know how they did it but this game makes a certain degree of micro management fun. 

The difficulty. This game isn't a cakewalk but neither is the combat impossible. You really have to pick up the right recruits (Backgrounds and traits and affinities with certain stats count here.) and the right fights and equip your lads accordingly to what you think to face. A whole squad of longbowmen at night in a dense wood is not ideal for one. Nor is a group of swordsmen against heavily armored foes. 
You also have to pace yourself in combat, getting cut off and surrounded means death. On top of that, a lucky enemy shot or blow can do you in as well but you can minimize risks by proper skill use.

Replay value. Pretty good as each game means you're on an entire newly generated map with differant people, settlements and nobles houses. Currently the dev's are working on so called late game calamities. This doesn't mean you will crash in late game, it means certain events will happen such as a huge orc invasion, an undead invasion or two noble houses going to war. With all of that no game will feel the same.

Pricing. This game is a steal for twenty bucks for all the awesomeness it delivers.

Now the bad things!

No matter how well armored your guys are, no matter how good their weapons are... your proud mercenary company WILL BE SLOWLY CUT DOWN TO PIECES BEACUSE THEY MISS EVERY-SINGLE-HIT WHILE AI WILL HIT YOU EVERYTIME. Seriously guys...this is a broken RNG system. Playing at expert with iron man. adopting good tactics, not just rushing in...using spears wall (useless cuz they miss to hit), shields wall covering my light infantry and shooters...no way. there's nothing you can do. just miss...miss...miss... using 2 handed heavy wepons hoping you can have crak troops to breach their soft spots is just a lose of men and of high priced equipment cuz they miss every hit and in the meantime they get slaughtered by and idiot with a leather tunic. IT HAPPENED. my 8 men company didn't land a single hit for 4 turns in a row. butchered by direwolves. or bandits. or zombies. if there would be cows opponents i'm sure they could also kill my whole company. they were wll equipped with heavy leather and mail. lost half company vs 5 direwolves. the other half was killed by bandits, always for th same reason. this cuold be the 100th time i start the game again, but nothing change. Also, losing well armored men is a hit you'll never recover because you lose your high priced armors for good. so you have to replace men and armors and you'll never have enough money. Every battle is a struggle where you hope you could land a hit...and when you win (not before lose at least 1 man per battle...i'm starting to think this is scripted and hardcoded in the game) you can olny think you have been lucky. It takes 2 or 3 man to kill 1 AI opponent, while you can easily see 1 AI man killing 2 3 or even 4 of your men. Guys playing this game is just a losing of time. At some point, RNG will kill company, even if you outnumber them, even if you are good equppied. BATTLE SYSTEM IS JUST A SERIES OF LOSE HITS INTERRUPTED SOMETIME BY LANDING ONE.

1. Use spears for the brothers.

4. When in a fight you know you will lose dont be afraid to run to fight another day. Dont forget to move all your men to the edge of the map before you retreat! Or you will suffer losses that will frustrate you to no end.
4. Equip your guys with secondary daggers so you can stab the guys you want to, too avoid breaking their armour.
5. Dont forget to buy food.
6. Dont forget to repair.
7. Bring something durable to punch or squeeze when it all goes wrong.

65,28922806,english,"If you're thinking about buying this game - i would not wait.  One of the best turn based / party based tactics games i've ever played.

Pros:

*Extremely good artwork.  Armor is historic and realistic, and as it is damaged each piece has several (visible on your character) levels of degredation.  After a long fought battle, your band of brothers will be broken, bruised and suitably bloody.  

*Very rewarding gameplay.  Your men are easily dispatched alone unless heavily outmatching your enemy, and you are encouraged to use numbers and group tactics to win.  Fights against even the most middling of bandits will quickly lose you a man to fatigue and overextension if you don't plan well.  The armor/HP/fatigue mechanic is well thought out and is simple to understand yet more complex than the ""Big armor means immortality"" system that most games use.

*Varied and sensible AI.  Bandits and human enemies will flock to the high ground, and attack what they view as the weakest point in your line.  They will put up shields before approaching spear walls.  Orks will literally run straight into you and fuck your shit up while screaming and jumping.  Goblins will avoid your line, circle around behind it, and snipe you with poison archers.  Undead (the lesser variants) will walk straight into a spearwall like the brainless morons they are.

*Money is made primarily by negotiating contracts, there are several variables to this and it adds a nice sense of immersion that you're a bargaining sellsword.

*HUGE variation of backgrounds for recruits.  From Cripples and refugees to disowned lords to tailors, they each have pros/cons suited to their background and random ones added on top.

*It's kind of refreshing to play as a group of regular and very flawed humans, facing off against  creatures and monsters that are vastly stronger than any of you individually.  Grown orks will absolutely dump on any soldier 1v1, and that is how it should be.


Cons:

*AP cost of weapons isn't stated in the description, only in combat.  You'll learn what costs what, but it's hard to put on a shiny new weapon (and risk losing it when you die) without knowing everything about it.

*Contracts vary from 1-3 skulls.  Difficulty scaling is a bit awkward sometimes and sometimes a 1 skull contract will feel like a 2.5.  A more reliable way to gauge difficulty is the original offer of payment.

- Procedurally generated fantasy worlds, characters, and even cultures.

   > Even your top level characters can be killed off if you're over-zealous
   > Combat that rewards you for good tactics (shield walls, spear walls, flanking, etc.)
- Player and NPC driven economy
- Total freedom. You want to rob the caravan that you're supposed to be escorting? Go for it. No one will ever know.
- Reputation system
   > Your reputation will dictate the contracts that you can take and how much you will get from said contract. The more         famous/trusted you are, the more money you'll get.
- Never-dull scenarios

<THE CONS>
- 2-speed types for game progression. There's no way to speed up time other than by setting up camp.
- Brutally unforgiving. Even your best men can be gone in a flash if you're not careful.
- Some bugs, easy exploits. Nothing overly notable though.

- Brutal turn based combat.  RNG is a factor, so be prepared to minimize your risks with effective tactics.  Battles are the meat of this game.  Not sure what to expect?  Head over to the developer's website and try out the (admittedly out-dated) demo.

- Character growth.  Backgrounds, traits, talents, perks and ability scores can be synergized to create really awesome mercenaries... or clumsy, club-footed dastards who will cripple your team by fleeing in the middle of combat :D

- Sandbox.  In a game without a set story line, you are free to tell yourself any story you want.  Roam at will, finding mercenary contracts in the towns and cities or just exploring the random sites you come across.  The only limits are your courage... and the necessity of actually paying and feeding your company.

- Gear.  Multiple tiers of weapons and armor, with some ""sidegrades"" thrown in for good measure.  The excellent diversity of weapons (with differences that actually matter!) allows many tactical options.  Compare attributes like: damage to HP, damage to armor, possible special effects (such as increased accuracy, hits cause bleeding wounds or extra critical hit damage) and unique attacks for each weapon type.  Oh, and did I mention that there are randomly generated ""unique"" weapons and armor for you aspiring treasure hunters?  Also accessories such as poison, antidotes, attack dogs, bandages, rage-inducing mushrooms...

Why do I like this game?

1) It is low fantasy and the tone is beautifully set in the narrative (character backgrounds), the graphics, musical score and of course the combat itself.
2) Good strategy and diversifying your mercenaries equipment will reward you; bad strategy will punish you (severely)
3) It is the right amount of addictive
4) You will grow attached to your mercenaries as they develop in your band, you will feel the joy as they turn the tide of combat, or the crushing pain as they are killed.

Been playing on veteran Iron Man, heres some tips:
- Don't play it like a video game, think more like real life decisions
   -- Example, be very picky and selective on missions. The system will NOT feed you contracts you can jump into sequentially. You'll need to travel and very carefully decide on if a mission is worth the risk.
- Helmets are almost more important than body armor, get your frontline metal helmets as fast as possible
- armor in general is hugely important, equally matched groups but with one team in better armor will wipe the floor with the lightly armed group.
- You will wipe and restart a LOT, the learning curve is very steep, but you will get better
- If a necromancer is on your map get the hell out, unless you can swarm and kill him he will overwhelm you with dead
- equip shields as much as possible, keep a spare in your bag to equip mid-fight if your first shield gets destroyed
- tools to repair weapons are worth their weight in gold, if you come to a town we're they're selling cheap stock up

Highly recommended! Can't wait to play the finished build. This is just the right kind of sandbox game.

More tips from failed games:
- goblin wolfriders will jack you up. Goblins in general will jack you up. Avoid them.
- Always have a few guys with weapons that can destroy shields, just had a raider with shield that would not die, had no axes and this punk ate through half my team on a night map.
- be very careful with 1 skull challenges, especially later in the game. If you're not properly geared a later game 1 star can eat you.
- Iron man is the only way to play since every choice matters and you can't save scum. Hired a disgraced nobleman for 750g. He dies in his first fight. Aint that a bitch.",1482278654,1482370419,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True,76561198006710444,117,15,74930,7148,2226.0,1601810405,,
5,28518916,english,"Highly Recommended!  A must-play for fans of X-Com, Fire Emblem, Mount and Blade, or Dungeons and Dragons.  Surprisingly deep strategic and tactical decision-making with permanent consequences.  Multiple paths to victory (or defeat) in each scenario, and NO paths to victory in some.  It makes you really consider each decision.  Retreat is always on the table for consideration.  You really grow attached to your mercs, and running away is preferable to poor Ludolf the Merciless losing an eye, or losing his life.  Scavenging fallen enemy parties has a giddy quality to it.  No two play-throughs are the same.  No battle feels like a repeat of the previous battle.  Terrain conditions and make-up of enemy squads keep you on your toes at all times.  

There are improvements that could be made.  I would like to see a deeper loot-spawn system.  At the moment, all falchions or hatchets are created equal.  Minor randomization of the stats would make looting and passing equipment out to your mercs that much more enjoyable.

6,28514516,english,"Overall
I've got to admit, I was very skeptical of this game when I first picked it up. Thirty hours later, it's still got a charm that can't be denied. Although the addition of more complicated mechanics (I'm thinking mages) would be fun, the game is still in development as I write this review. That said, what the devs have already created is a solid mechanical base upon which additions can be made. Although I can't say that this game would be worth the 20$ tag for everyone, it's definitely a fun experience.

Positive remarks
-Advanced difficulty level is actually difficult.
-Solid battle mechanics
-A large appeal within the genre is the reward of building up characters through adversity. You get attached to the village farmer who willingly throws himself into the fray so the to protects his allies, and it's hard when he gets an early retirement through death or permanent injury. 
-The random encounters, missions, and dialogue in general are all well written. This came as a great and welcome surprise.

Negative remarks
-Patrol missions are horrible and boring. I turn them down.
-Pathing on the world map is... Stupid. The game is still in development though.
-The mechanics are also a weakness due to the game's relative simplicity. It's fun to learn how to counter a range of enemies who have cool and unique abilities... Yet you don't... I think this is my main problem with the game in its current state. The foundations of a good game are all there, but Battle Brothers falls short. Take for example that there isn't a single skill with a cooldown that isn't fatigue imposed. There's so much room to play, but it hasn't been explored yet.

Move your band of sellswords in real-time over a world map in 2D where you travel between places filled with hostiles to fight or Settlements to hire new mercs, trade, or buy some equipment Battle brothers reminds me a bit of Mount and Blade, only with less things to do- don't expect too much interaction with the world. Until now it is a sandbox game that is centered around it's tactical combat. This is where the game begins to shine:

If you decide to engage enemies (they are divided in 4 categories: Thieves/Raiders, Greenskins, Undead/beasts and hostile Lords (because you made them hostile, good job!) the game switches into tactical mode. 

Lead up to 12 mercenaries (and 6 in reserve) into tactical, turn based-hex field combat. Initiative, chance to hit, armour penetration, stats for HP, cth, cte, morale, choose up to 12 perks per char...you know the drill!

The AI plays quite well. Prepare to be spanked. AI knows how to flank and to pick out your weak spots (like: focussing your unshielded mercs with their ranged units first). Some opponents are really tough. Expect to lose a lot of mercs on your route. In ironman mode, expect to loose the game as well. One, two mistakes in placement, a mishap. And your whole party can go to hell...it's punishing sometimes, but not to the point where it would frustrate: mistakes can be reproduced, singled out and avoided next time. Hopefully.

After a succesful battle, loot, level up, grab your payment and hop on to the next adventure.

The game is certainly still lacking in strategic depth and world map content. But the atmosphere is just right. The gorgeous art design and a very fitting sound track paint a gritty atmosphere befitting a medieval low-fantasy setting perfectly well. The tactical combat is brutal and engaging.

[h1]Battle Brother is a game which worth its price.[/h1]

[u][b]Context :[/b][/u]
You are the new leader of a medieval warband due to the former captain's death against bandits. You will recruit, equip, level and eventually burry your battle brothers during your travels in a world randomly generated at each new game, between the icy lands of the north to south's sandy beaches passing throw swamp and dark forests.

In each [b]worldmap[/b] (Mount&Blade like), most of human cities and settlements are ruled by three noble houses, some are also independent, but all will offer you contracts more or less difficult to complete to earn reputation and gold.

These [b]contracts[/b] are very differents from one another, from caravan escort to orcish fights or graveyard exploration, on tacticals map depending on your location (forest, swamp, snow...).
The combat system is very intuitive and tactical, specially recommended for those who like turn-based strategic games (like X-com but less inmersive).

Your actions will determine your reputation. Will you be a cruel bandit or a noble mercenary ? Will you flee from battle to fight another day or die with honour ?


[u][b]Visual :[/b][/u]
See screenshots. The team's graphist is very talented. Arts are excellents and immerse player into game. I love style and textures, and specifically the days and nights effects traducing the time of the day from dawn to dust and vice versa. 


[u][b]Audio :[/b][/u]
Just beautiful. Each ennemie has few specific musics.
So with some experience you will know who is ambushing you just by listening ;)


[u][b]Gameplay :[/b][/u]
On the worldmap, if not paused, time is spending continuously during your actions (travel, camp, repairs, heal) with very nice visual effects. Your main job will be to take contracts, one contract at a time, in towns, castle and cities. Contracts are missions with a narrative context which if you take time to read, generate sometimes shivers or laughs. Suceed and will earn notorioty, gold and upgrade relationship with settlements.
[list]
[*]Gold is usefull to buy goods, food for your men, equip and heal them.
[*]Good relationship enables you to decrease marchant prices. Eventually a bad one will may end in a fight.
[*]Notorioty influence events ends or possibilities. Events are triggered depending on your action, the background of your men, their level, randomly... I let you discover those which are a good part of Battle Brother's richness.
[/list]
With all that you will mostly fight to level your men (if they survive) against abundance of ennemies (orcs, gobelins, bandits, knights, undead, ...). Each ennemy faction has its own tactics in battle and you'll have to adapt and prepare your men consequently. It is a nice challenge : panel of weapons, armors and skills will be the key to do so.
Most of the time you will decide when and where you'll fight but not always due to night or surprise attack or ambush. Last but not least there are some dungeons to explore with legendary item as reward.

As there is no really end to the game, as long as you survive, it's really great to play countless hours with the men you trained from their beginning to the mighty knight or agile bowman he has became (and you may cry their death).


[h1]Cons :[/h1]
- Band limited, you will not able to rule a castle or manage anything different than your own warband.
- No horses in a medieval game (wtf? ;).


[h1]Pros :[/h1]
+ Very conscientious Devs listening to the community.
+ Interesting skills-tree to develop your own tatics.
+ Various ennemies (humans, beasts, greenskins, undead).
+ Various armor, weapons, goods to trade or craft and more.
+ No-end campaign or retire when you want (except premature death ;).
+ Each game is unique.
+ Donkeys !

[i]To conclude, Battle Brothers' world is mainly unexplored, dark and full of terrors. If you like the visual and turn based tactical game with a deep RPG immersion do not hesitate.[/i]",1482008507,1482008507,True,11,1,0.548745334148406982,0,True,False,True,76561198012764781,58,7,36959,0,9783.0,1597617628,,

The idea is similar, use your band of warriors to complete quests, earn better gear and troops, then fight bigger better challenges! Battle Brothers executes this exceptionally well, the quests are neat and can contain surprising twists and turns. Even double pay! Yay! Combat is pretty straightforward, yet challenging enough to make you consider every maneuver with great care. Gear matters greatly, though the quality of your troops carries more weight in my opinion. However, there are two significant limitations to this game. Firstly, you cannot yet interact in any great depth with the Houses which control regions in the game. Occassional house specific quests, but nothing else. Secondly, enemies in this game are not yet too varied. I have found myself performing hunting quests and it seems the only damn creatures that mutilate townsfolk and livestock are bloody direwolves!

So, to recap!

Pros:

24,28404711,english,"I love the games idea and the graphics. Also from the positive side the characters development and personalization is fun. The combats are quite fun also although quite simple strategically. I think that there is some brilliant potential in this game. Still I have to be picky too as there are some issues. Firstly the world map - too small. Really too small. And too little factions, cities and stuff. Secondly the variety of enemies is too small again. Thirdly the missions are too repetitive and also the choice is limited. There are too little proper weapons and weapon varieties. As most of the 280 different items are useless. Limiting the characters to level 11 in such a game also isnt cool the whole point is hoarding and developing your party so let there be a bigger map, more going on, more weapons to collect, and more levels to gain. Also more perks would offer a better variety- some could be something fun too - not all have to be practical.  And Finally add some statistics - I would love to see how many kills my soldiers have made and how many wounds gained and so on. Also a hall of the fallen would be lovely to remember all the dead tin soldiers.

25,28393758,english,"Bought into this early and it was a fun little game from the start. I've taken two long breaks, and every time I come back after a few months, the game is loads more fun than it was before.

ABRIDGED COMPARISONS: It's a little bit of XCOM with a little bit of Mount and Blade. There are shades of both, but it's presented in a way that's unique to itself. The way you traverse the world, interact with factions and find new recruits reminds me of roaming the land building my army in Mount and Blade, but soldiers with personalities, the sting of a loss... That's a lot like XCOM.

MORE DETAILED ASSESSMENT: Battle Brothers puts you in a procedurally generated sandbox environment and allows you  to do what you will in it. Your actions are limited to the mercenary band context, of course. You can't be a farmhand or an alchemist. But you can use your band to support factional wars, take on tasks for pay, raid villages and trade caravans, hunt bands of beasts and bandits, explore the world... Whatever you like.

The visual style is simple, but gorgeous. The interface is fairly clear and features a lot of ""medieval charm"", and the world is generated smoothly with a wonderful ""hand-painted"" sort of style. Each village and town looks a little different from the next, both on the village screen and on the world map. But the real beauty of the visuals is felt in battle.

With several different combinations of appearance for every character the game generates, including those who aren't human, everyone has a bit of extra personality just at a glance. Even a town militia is full of faces that I find myself attaching quirks and traits to from time to time. Characters actually wear their equipment. Weapons, armor, headgear, ammunition, it all ""paperdolls"" on the character busts... and both characters and equipment are visually affected by damage. Armor cracks and tears as it takes damage, and rips off when destroyed. Shields split and go flying when broken. Heads fly off from a solid critical hit with an axe or sword. Your Battle Brothers and their foes show the blood, bruises, and even scars of their conflicts. It's an excellent touch that really brings the game to life for me.

While I'm not one for judging soundtracks, I'd also like to say the music in Battle Brothers is superb as well. Each different ""type"" of battle has a different backing track that drives home the feel of the foe you're fighting. When facing off against the undead, the creepy, horror-style backing track reminds you that what you're facing is decidedly not natural. When fighting Orcs, the war drums and occasional shouting chants seem to act in time with the charge-and-barge fighting style of your brutish opponents, making you feel like you're in a fight for your life where your adrenaline is pumping non-stop in an attempt to match the ferocity of your greenskin foes.

The sound in general is actually excellent, from the sound of an axe splitting a shield to that of an orc letting out a gutteral roar from a few hexes away. I was worried the minimal animation would make the battles feel to much like a ""board game"", but the sound effects do a tremendous job of bringing battles to life. I can't praise the sound work of this game enough.

Finally, the gameplay. Simply put, Battle Brothers is a game where most every decision matters. For the most part, you'll be living hand-to-mouth, taking whatever job you can find to pay your men another day or, if you're really having a good run, perhaps expanding your roster by one or two men. Keeping your men paid and fed is a must, as they'll start to desert one by one if you don't. The game does a good job of giving you just enough pay from each job, just enough loot from each encounter, to keep you rolling... so long as you're pacing yourself well.

And I say ""pacing"" for a reason. Resting is occasionally not an option. Sometimes you NEED coin RIGHT NOW. Sometimes you're far from civilization and surrounded by raiders, direwolves or heaven knows what else. But when you have the opportunity, letting your men lick their wounds is crucial. Too little health, and one solid, unlucky blow could spell death for your mercenaries. If their armor was weakened in a recent battle and you don't give the men time to repair it, it won't do much of anything for them in the next fight. The struggle of choice between pressing on for more coin or taking time to recuperate is a central part of the tension in the gameplay throughout. It also rewards skillful tactics by letting you flow from battle to battle, gain to gain, more freely when you do well, as your men are in good shape and their equipment in good repair. Much like an actual army rides momentum.

The combat in Battle Brothers is tactical, from a gameplay standpoint. It features randomly generated hex-grid maps where terrain, obstacles, and elevation can help or hinder a cunning player's mercenaries. Archers fire further and more accurately at those below them, and elevation grants your men a hit and evasion bonus in melee as well. The more enemies who surround one of your guys, the harder it is to avoid their blows... and the more of you that surround the, the easier it is to hit the bastards.

Managing equipment for each of your men is a key component of your role as captain, and it has tangible effects in combat. More than a simple ""good -> better -> best"" progression, there are several types of weapons in the game, from halberds and billhooks to daggers and great axes. Each weapon offers its wielder unique abilities. Holding a two-handed axe, you can perform a 360 degree cleave. Axes of any kind can break shields with relative ease. Flails are tricky to wield, but swing more easily around shields. Swords allow you to skillfully stand in defense and counter anyone who misses you in melee, while spears let you drive back those who would dare enter your zone of control. These are just a few of the potential tools at the disposal of your mercenaries.

There's also the matter of defensive equipment. Will you give your man a shield to protect him from the foe's blades, or let him get a two-handed grip on his otherwise one-handed weapon for more damage? Will you give your man light armor that allows him to act faster and tires him out slower, or heavy armor that can take more punishment? A visored helm that decreases his line of sight in exchange for making him a bulwark in battle, or a padded coif to dampen superficial blows? Every choice has an effect on the tactics available to you, and allows you to hand-craft a mercenary band to do what you need it to do. Of course, your available funds tie into how flexible your loadouts can be, and you'll also want to watch the skills of your men...

There's another point in favor of Battle Brothers. Every character you run across comes with a procedurally generated background, which influences his baseline stats. Sometimes he also comes with traits that affect him positively or negatively. A Spartan man consumes less rations and won't abandon you as quickly as the rest when you run out of food, but a Glutton is just the opposite. Some men are better up close, others at range. Some have a firm defense, others none at all. Some are strong-willed, while others will grow uneasy at the first sign of trouble. Every man, even two from the same background, will come with a slightly different spread of stats.

As your men survive battles, they gain experience and level up, allowing you to choose from a robust pool of perks for them that fine-tune how they fight by giving them access to new abilities or passive effects. Each level also allows you to increase three stats of your choosing by a random amount, displayed before you make the choice. Losing a high-level mercenary will sting.

I'd go on, but character limit. Literally can't. Buy it, it is great fun.",1481834679,1481834679,True,11,0,0.553122103214263916,0,True,False,True,76561198012821328,401,75,3678,0,1479.0,1567618634,,

27,26138414,english,"Anyone who has said this game is similar to Jagged Alliance 2 and X-Com are correct. I have searched the world over since 1991 for a true successor to X-Com, and was pleasently repreived when JA2 was realeased in '99. After that though, from the new X-Com games to Xenonauts (which is playable at least) I have walked away disappointed with most of the turn-based squad level TBS games (With RPG elements) I've played. This is the type of game Battle Brothers is.

It is an exception to the rule above. For reference X-Com receives a 9.5. Jagged Alliance a 9.1. Right now at the early .07.0.10 (apx) release I give this game a solid 8, and could be talked into an 8.5. It's not really buggy, and it's easy to ""get into"" your mercs, and reload when they die and such (which is really not necessary, you can play forever with new mercs and never reallly be disappointed like you would have been in Jagged Alliance which practically forced you to save and reload) but as soon as I give my mercs a custum name I'm attached and must see them live forever even if I have to replay a battle a dozen times!

LOL, the fun part though is probably forgoing all that, being a real Turn-Based commander, and playing on Iron Man! 

The game isn't labeled as a Roguelike or Rogue-lite or anything but the strategic map and any of the tactical maps you play on are clearly randomly generated. The graphics are more than enough for me, though no one will call them eye candy (I don't have a sweet tooth myself). What wins here is the gameplay, and charm of your mismatched bunch of fishermen, vagabonds, deserters, retired sergeants, and other motley miscreants! 

My review is lite on details, I know, It's just a testamonial. I have well over 1000 hours on the original X-Com, and at least a similar amount with JA2 and it's various user made mods. If you know those games you know this one. If you love those games, buy this right now. If you don't know them, read some of the other reviews and decide for yourself if the genre is for you. If you need fast paced action, this isn't it.

28,28383309,english,"I do like a good turn based game having come from the school of X Com, this is only really similar in that it is turn based. You command a mercenary group of upto 18 soldiers, fielding upto 12 at once in Battle. You start with three lowly soldiers but can recruit more on your travels in towns around the map. Each soldier has a background profession that they used to do, for example butcher, gravedigger, deserter. These will have effects on stats confering bonuses or disadvantages. Characters stats can be upgraded and also perks picked to compliment fighting styles. With your mercenary company you travel the map doing jobs for the towns for crowns which can be spent on better weapons and armour, you also need food, mediacl supplies and ammo to replenish after battle. The battles themselves are fun and chess like on a hex based grid, your soldiers have special attacks they can use but fatigue, resolve and health must all be managed to win. I really get attached to my troops as the days and weeks pass, and losing one can hit hard.

Food for thought.
I think rare items should be more custom than just slightly better stats. Like what was done with the fangshire helm where it negates nighttime penalties.

I think people are finally seeing past the glamour that has fallen upon the games industry for past 10 to 15 years; at least when it comes to P.C games and strategy ones in particular. For all the glamour fanboys that need the shallow beautiful AAA games there is something called a console and there are many to choose from now a days......GTA12345 is pretty but once youve stolen your 100th car its a bit dull. 

Battle brothers has that same feeling when I used to play X-Com way back in the 90's. The feeling of triumph and elation when you finally beat an opponent that has beaten you down so many times before and that heart in mouth moment when every thing hangs on an RNG moment of hit or miss. 

I love the whole open ended approach to the game; there is no world in peril (again) needing to be saved from some evil. There is no damned damsel in distress.......in fact there are no women in this game i think. You can wander around and do whatever you please; so long as you don't get caught by orcs that is. 

For the first few hours I save scummed the hell out of my original game and almost rage quit a few times and have ranted on many occasions about how unbalanced/stupid/unfair/****** stupid RNG and many other things but after swearing I wasnt going to play it again I did and I'm glad i did. You get so used to being led like a donkey everywhere in modern games that you forget how things used to be and in Battle Brothers it lets you wander off into the hills on your first day and fight a small army of orcs......that was my first round of uttering 'well thats fucking stupid' Then i realized that the world doesnt have any safe zones as such......safer zones maybe and you have to pick and choose your fights.....

Currently and this might be subject to change of course but you can wipe or as near as damn it wipe and still rebuild your company. It just depends on if you have the patience or not.

In many ways it also reminds me of Mount and Blade(without the first person); which is due its very promising sequel soon. 
The flaw with Battle Brothers is the inevitable lack of substance which is not a critique just something that you have to accept currently but when Battle Brothers the sequel comes out..........who knows you might be the owner of your own keep eventually hiring mercenaries to keep your lands safe while you wage private wars or maybe you just want to watch the world burn and tear everything down.",1480908141,1480908141,True,2,0,0.471537351608276367,0,True,False,True,76561198002308919,145,45,17020,0,3686.0,1560887651,,

49,28188674,english,"Disclaimer: This game is still in early access at the time of this review.

I picked this up in the Black Friday sale period. I have played it around 26 hours at the time of this writing. The game revolves around your ""Battle Brothers"", a mercenary group of sellswords, though you can create a different name for your company. your crew makes money by accepting and fullfilling contracts plus the occaisional stray battle, special discovered site, or a random event. This is good because you are going to need that money. You have to provide food, supplies to fix your equipment, healing herbs, soldier paychecks and other things. The better your soldiers the more pay they demand. 

The game is low fantasy at least so far in play time. There are some undead, and a few enemies that might be considered 'magical"" in nature but most enemies are a typical human bandit, orc, or goblin. Magic ala D&D is not this game. healing is slow, and no magic spells for your troops that I have encountered yet. What's worse (for your troopers anyway) is they can sustain injuries that permenatly disable them. I would advise not getting too attached to any particular soldier as they soon may be missing an ear, have a broken bone that fails to heal right, and other infirmities thatmake a once first rate soldier into a crawling, cowardly cripple. Since there is no healing magic that I have found (beyond a antidote for poison potion) you are limited to banding your folks in battle, but that is not an easy task to do as disengaging from melee can prove difficult, unless your soldier has learned a particular skill to disengage safely. The upside of this, is that you can inflict crippling wounds on your enemies too, which will drastically reduce their combat power. Combat is turned based, with each participent taking a turn based on their initiative rating.

There is a good assortment of weapons and armor in the game. Some have reach, some are great for destroying sheilds and armor, others perform poorly against armored targets. Each type of weapon may have a special attack or defense ability. For example, axes are great at destroying sheilds and spears can form a ""spear wall"" that pushes attackers away. A good mix of weapons, fighting styles,and armor seems to be a good idea. Each weapon and armor type incurrs fatigue. As battles drag on, the combatants begin to tire, depriving them of special attacks and abilities. So you really have to balance things. Do you really want to wear that great chain mail knowing that it is going to wear your soldier out quick? 

Graphics and sound are primitive by todays, but sufficient for the task. If you are all about graphics, forget it. There are still a lot of parts of the game that you can see, but cannot interact with yet, or at least, I have not discovered how. Like, you can see a copper mine, but cannot do anything with it or the veteran's hall in large cities. There is no crafting yet that I have seen but I think the foundation may be there since you can buy or loot things like amber, copper ingots, and dyes. These may be just trade goods and will never be more than that. We shall see. 

The game is very stable. I have not experienced a single crash yet. The interface is a bit clicky but tolerable. The game seems mostly bug free. There was one point where I couldn't end a soldier's turn, but I could pass his turn till later in the round and was able to end it when he came up at the end of the initiave rotation. 

All in all I think this game has great potential as long as you are not graphics fanatic.",1480872523,1480872523,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True,76561198021208360,192,5,2606,0,1688.0,1558993753,,

52,28149451,english,"Just bought this game today and wasnt for sure if the game was worth the 20 dollar asking price. However I will say this is a early access game that is definetly worth the price. Now lets get right down to it....

The Pros

~Art style is really simple and looks nice at the same time. Due to the simple design it really does leave room for detail. Examples being bandages on your battle brothers post battle and cuts and scrapes visible during and after fights. Your battle brothers leave bandages on till they are fully healed which could take days so that really boosts the realism for me

~Along with damage being shown it also has a long lasting effect on your battle brothers. If one of them takes a mortal blow in battle they have a chance of getting a permanent injury and the debuff range can be from missing fingers that causes a battle brother to miss more attacks to broken bones not setting correctly lowering there overall damage.

~The map and different towns have their own factions/kingdoms with their own reputation bars that you can raise or lower. So it definetly allows you to align with one if you so wish.

~You can name your battle brothers and customize them! However this is a very twisted feature considering how easy it is to lose your brothers so it really leaves you with xcom levels of attachement with your company.

~ Combat system is sound and very easy to pick up if you are adept with 4x tile like strategy games



The Cons

~The game is in desperate need of rebalancing. Bandits are very easy to dispatch and have no strategy to them while Orcs are all over the place power wise. The orc young are barely stronger then bandits but 1 orc beserker can kill 8 well equipped battle brothers surrounded. However i have no qualms with the armored orcs for they are hard to damage but the dont do much damage compared to other orcs so they are balanced. Monsters like ghouls or direworlves in my opinion are fair.

~ I know i just finished praising the map and how diverse it was but I have this feeling that the map in this game has to much space in between kingdoms. There is too much open space here and I believe they should add more villages or at least one more kingdom  to make the map more lively. Too many times do i feel that the game drags on when i take a contract that makes me travel all the way across the barren swamp or desert parts of the map just to deliver a package that only pays out a measley 250 gold.

~Speaking of delivery quests, if the game wants to have them it needs a way to locate the quest location on the map so the player can decide if the amount of gold paid for the distance traveled is worth the price. A few times when i chose to do a delivery quest i find out the distance totally outweighs the price of the contract and its too late to cancel the contract so i must do it to continue on.

- You can assemble the formation of your brothers and get pretty creative with the setup for different builds. These formations are then used in battles where you aren't suprised.
- All of the mercenaries seem to have something to bring to the table and each of the backgrounds seem to interact with one or two other backgrounds to make interesting story events.
- You can spend a week at a tavern getting all your brothers properly sloshed if they've all become upset or depressed.
- each weapon and piece of armor you equip your brothers with forms a different strategy in that one character and his place in the battle-line.
- enemies seem to be pretty challenging no matter how much time has passed - so most battles will still feel challenging.

As of now though, sometimes treasure in some of the harder 'dungeons' is a little underwhelming and not really worth the loss of equipment and or mercenaries. Sometimes you get pretty good vendor trash or even rare equipment but it seems to happen uncommonly.

62,26078469,english,"I've racked up almost 170 hours in Battle Brothers in the last year and a half or so, so I guess it's high time to say my piece on it.

Short version: 
Battle Brothers is a really damn cool game and you should get it.

Altogether-More-Words-Than-Really-Necessary version: 
Back when I bought it, Battle Brothers was considerably more barebones than it is now, and even still it was good for many hours of fun. Since then, every single update has only improved and enhanced the game, and every new campaign I've started has been more fun than the previous one. Today I sincerely rank Battle Brothers among my favourites in the turnbased tactics genre.

Audiovisually the game is a very pleasant, coherent package. The visual design is delightfully free of overwrought pomp, improbable anatomy and questionable ergonomics; The equipment, characters and monsters look down-to-earth and credible. The detailed, hand-drawn, slightly cartoony art style is delightful and plays wonderfully together with the calm and simple, yet catchy and evocative soundtrack, perfect for the game's setting of gritty medieval fantasy. A great example of ""less is more"", a beautiful balance of form and function.

Combat is where the art department's prowess does the most good for gameplay. Eventhough the charming boardgame pawn-like character sprites themselves are static, it is never unclear what is happening or who's equipped with what thanks to the clear, detailed graphics and elegant little visual cues. Thanks to this and especially the meaty sound effects, the combat feels startlingly visceral for such a boardgamey affair. 

While Battle Brothers does not have any sort of central story, it does have a decent amount of writing. Not only is you picking up and turning in contracts presented in short narrative text boxes, there are also random events that might pop up during your travels. And although the setting of the game is gritty, it is not altogether grim. The writing has a dry wit to it, a kind of rascally tone that is just perfect to set the tone for a story of a rough-and-tumble band of mercenaries.

All that said, the cruxes of a tactics RPG like this are still character development and combat, both of which Battle Brothers does commendably. The level of complexity is just right to offer plenty of choices and variety without being overwhelming or opaque. Character perks have tangible, meaningful effects and the math behind them and the character stats is simple, consistent and easy to grasp. The various kinds of weapons have various pros and cons, and any choice is viable in one situation or other. Armor is where I would perhaps like to see more factors in play, as currently it is merely a balancing act between protection and fatigue, with helmets also having a penalty to vision range to consider.

And then there are the titular (anti)heroes of the game; your very own battle brothers. Eventhough they are procedurally generated and the pool of different background stories is sorely limited, the various professions and character traits bring a surprising amount of character to them, and there's a myriad little emergent moments to be found with them. Torsten, the dimwitted but brave farmhand who alone held three orcs at bay with his spear; Baldur, the retired soldier who took up arms again to join you just to be immediately stabbed to death by goblins; Bjarne the nearsighted beggar you hired on as disposable frontline fodder but is now your most fearsome axe murderer; I could go on and on, but you get the picture.

Overall, the level of polish in this game is admirable. There is very little technical jank; sometimes buildings in the city screen flicker a bit and the as-of-yet nonfunctional buildings are a bit of a sore thumb, but that's all I can think of. The UI is pleasing to the eye, responsive and easy to use save for a couple tiny niggling issues. 

Of course, being Early Access, there are still a number of things to do to flesh the game out further. Fortunately the devs are quite forthcoming with information regarding their plans and the development process. It is apparent that they know exactly what sort of work the game needs and have the competence and motivation to do it, and do it right. As such, I have nothing but confidence that this gem of a game will shine all the brighter when it is finally finished.

caught my attention when I saw the intro videos,
much of the positivities in the reviews,
looked further into the discussions,
purchased it without second thoughts.

Reading through the guides and other discussion post,
better idea of the game,
Began the journey of my mercenary campaign in Veteran Ironman mode.

Graphics are great, 
very detail in the aspect of the world, the men and creatures, the equipments when equiped, the injuries and fallouts of the battles, even hitting skeletons can see pieces of bones falling off to the ground.
Gameplay is good, hard, requires careful tactical analysis and some form of luck.
Audio and Music are fine, 
rarely had music on for games, kept BB's ON, fits well at low volume in the background.


Game could use more;

Control improvements, option customizations and better responsive point and click.
A better log system, perhaps a transparent log content at lower left corner, than the current top left, that requires a click to open every battle and blocks a portion of the screen.

Characters lores to recruit, Random enemy spawns, Missions and Events.

Choices for decision making in events and contracts, to allow more player interactions, 
rather than simply bargainning for acceptance. Mission details are vague on locations and paths until you chose to accept and leaving the dialogue only to realise it was a bad route.

More cosmetic customizations, or even introduce female mercenaries.



Time flows too quickly in the game, 
little grasp of any accidental leaving town, looking at the world to click a better pathing,
waste a few hrs of gameday.
Always have to remember to press Spacebar exiting the town, or when trying to consider,
time flow is money, salary and resource wastage.





Really looking forward to more improvements to the game.
So far, no regrets, and pleased with the purchase.

The goal is to survive, accept a quest, kill stuff get loot/money, upgrade your team and repeat.

Very active devs and forum.

But watch out, a fatigue system is in the game, you can put heavy steel armor on everyone but then they can only attack twice before they are exhausted so they need to be trained to get more fatigue or equip them lighter.

You have your company move around on a real time worldmap where you can interact with friendly locations, enemy groups and assorted hostile places. Meanwhile you take on missions and try to keep your company both alive and afloat in a hostile world.

99,27305930,english,"Tl;dr tough tactical rpg with many features not found in other games.

I think I like this game mainly because you can die. One of the better features of this game is that you hire your band of mercenaries and equip them and assign level up points and perks. You invest time into where to place them, how to use them in battle, then start a battle and all hell breaks loose. You try your best, but that one guy with a bow just has that perfect hit and your new recruit is now lying in a pool of his own blood. But it's ok, because the next guy you recruit has a native +10% exp gain because of his ""quickmind"" and THIS TIME you're going to put him in the back and protect him.

That's one of many things you think of and plan in a game that offers up a pretty unique experience before you even get to the tactical screen. Then the tactical battles are a lot of trial and error until you finally get your front line leveled and geared up enough to provide adequate blocking and tanking. But they're still vulnerable and the enemies are varied enough in their skills that it keeps you on your toes. Where I am with 4 lvl 10s up front with great gear, I still have to make sure I have a backup plan should any of them need it, and that does happen from time to time. 

On that note, most tactics game involve leveling up to the point that your characters pretty much can't die and are effectively using the same tactic over and over and just droning through the missions. In this game your one strategy is your basic set up, but from there it varies wildly. I have 4 tanks (1 with a 2h pike) then behind center, 2 xbows, then 2 bows next to them, then 4 spear throwers (with quickhands perk to replace with their main weapon for no action points). So I'm pretty focused on dealing damage before the baddies get close. That's the best I've come up with, but when you're facing enemies with shields, the plan isn't as effective. When facing off against skeletons, ranged damage is heavily reduced and I have to go in an melee. So my base plan stays true about 30-40% of the time, then I have to get those spear throwers involved in ways they might not be ready for (they are usually the ones to die most frequently). 

And the AI knows how to attack my defenses. They go for the weak link and try to flank your archers, they use elevation ot shoot arrows further. They shield break and surround your guys. They revive the deadites closest to your archers. They just f your stuff up sometimes and you have to find a temple to heal injuries and replace your main guys with some of your reserves. It's the best kind of management, and it doesn't feel like a tedious step. It's all part of the charm and appeal of the game.

Now this game is early access and has some stuff to flesh out, but not much. I waited about a year and recently purchased the game and I have to say it feels complete by most early access standards. The only part that can be a grind is the long treks from city to city. There are random events that happen as you walk around, but they can be infrequent which makes the travel somewhat monotonous. I use that as time to go a slightly different way and usually end up finding some secret enemy base. Some of which have unique items that are much more powerful than the basic gear. So it's worth it to explore. But it still feels slow at times. I almost want the ability to buy a wagon or something so I can hold extra gear and move a bit faster, but on the other hand, part of the game's difficulty comes from the fact that you sometimes lose shields and armor in battle so you have to have extra gear on the side and your space can be limited when you account for food and the like.

I would offer a few suggestions on the UI to keep the food, healing stuff, repair stuff, etc up all the time so you don't have to open the party menu. There are times when you need it and it's not displayed. That and missions aren't clearly stated enough when you get them. There are banners to tell you where they're from or what they involve (I'm guessing) but you can't really see them as they are covered with difficulty skulls. And the skulls are not consistent. Maybe the skulls mean something else and/or change based on your party's skill levels, but a 3 skull can be an encampment of orc, but it could also be a 1 skull. So it's really Russian roulette when it comes to missions sometimes. I would say rate the missions in a batch of skulls so like 1-3, 3-5, 6-8, 8-9, 10+ or something like that. So you can get still get the surprise of a tougher battle but it's not too far removed from the skull level.

All in all this game is darn fun and I'd highly recommend it to anyone who likes tactical rpg games. I'm having a lot of fun with it and I don't feel pressured to make quick decisions. It's a punishing game at times, but nowhere near frustrating as to want to rage quit like some other games. Most of the difficulty comes from accepting missions that are too tough for your band. So that's really a non issue. You learn to accept losing guys from time to time and trying out different perks to both fit your needs and the mercenary's native skills and bonuses. Now I'm probably going to play this game because writing this review has rustled up the urge to play and my mom will be mad because I'm going to be late to Thanksgiving dinner... sorry mom.

Like Battle Brothers.

It essentially is an XCOM game set in a low fantasy world, where your band of misfits travels the world, earns coin by taking on a jobs no one else would, and generally has a good time slaying all sorts of rabble from bandits and goblin raiders to orcs and ghosts.

Acoustic soundtrack is just a work of art, dark and gritty art style and character design fit the setting perfectly and game provides a reasonable challenge and difficulty curve. If you play smart, you will never be at a tremendous disadvantage (with the exception of goblin wolfriders at low levels, squirmy little bastards). Writing isn’t also half bad. Some events and quests are actually really entertaining and can serve as a comic relief of sorts. 

The game is really good as it is and the future updates promise features that will only improve the final product (noble houses warfare, invasions, camp followers and officers, magical trinkets and artefacts, dungeons, rival mercenary companies and much more).

It is really a shame that more people are not aware of this game. Truly a hidden gem among indie games.

19,26838184,english,"First:
 this is an EARLY ACCESS review, as I'm writing this things are still undergoing changes.

Pros:
- The artstyle (although without legs) is nice to look at and everything has a slight grim dark touch, escpecially if you consider that injuries are shown on your models.
- The combat system is TBS, and I'm very happy about that, since at the moment it is very hard to find a good TBS System, (most games simply use RTS, even the remake of Master of Orion turned from TBS to RTS... blasphemy if you ask me) therefore I'm very happy to say that the TBS works very well and feels good.
Also it's not like the XCom2 TBS where you simply alphastrike everything as soon as it comes into sight, it really feels like a fight, a fight in which both sides trade blows equally... a fight which might end with some losses but even if some of your guys die, that's not the end of the world, actually it's expected.
-The world feels good and has a nice storytelling-touch.

cons:
-At the moment (as said it's still in EA) it lacks an endgame, you build your mercenary troupe with barely more than shirts and garden tools up into a strong force of battle hardened (or crippled) veterans in thick scalemail and with strong foe-crushing weapons, you gather money and relics like scrooge mc duck... but what then? You still travel from town to town doing no more than continuously fighting battle after battle for money that you actually don't need anymore.


In the end:

And the world certainly is a dangerous place for a mercenary, in this procedurraly created world map, where noble houses ask you to everything from bringing a ""Spy"" to a neighbouring village of a rival house.  To transporting cargo that may or may not have rather sinister content in it.  This world is a low fantasy, where there's little magic, and little help from the gods or whatnot they might be.  You will tangle with orcs, direwolves, goblins, skeletons, zombies,vampires and obviously those pesky humans that can't help but kill each other.   

The game play is a well done version of any turn based rpg, where weapon types give you new movesets.  Characters have traits and talents based on their background, some have traits that weakens them, and some have traits that improve their stats.  You will curse the moments when a lucky hit from that goblin bypasses your swordmasters armorr, who is then felled.  You win the battle, but your poor swordmaster is dead, or is he? If you're lucky he might survive with everything intact but his... Nose, which has an impact on his stats.  Some injuries like the one this unlucky swordmaster sustained is permanent, but most injuries heal after some days if you have the medical supplies. 

Now as mentioned just before supplies, you need food to feed your band of merry or not so merry men, you need tools to repair their battered armor and weapons.  You will need ammunition to refill your archer's quivers, but most important you will need money. Cause who sacrefices their lives for free? No one, not even beggars are satisfied with just food, not that beggars make great mercenaries either, unless they're talented that is.  

There are nifty events that occur at pretty much random, which can give increased stats if certain prerequisites are satisfied. Hedge knights might decide to fight, joust and whatnot and get increased stats.  An old soldier might train one of your younger recruits, if he's taken a shine to him.  

The game is still in early access, and I've yet to taken a long look on their roadmap, but at the moment the game has no end, and the story is what you make of it.

For an early access game, this is extraordinarily well polished.

There's a wonderful sense of building your team over time, as you acquire better weapons, armor, and most importantly, skills. However, you quickly learn that every benefit comes with a cost -- heavier armor and weapons will wear your hapless mercs out faster, with dire impacts on combat performance. The weapon types -- swords vs. flails vs. spears, and so on, axes, everything -- all have their own strengths and weaknesses that significantly change how they should be used on the battlefield, and against which foe. It's far more sophisticated than rock, paper, scissors; you feel like you're really learning something.

There will be injuries. There will be deaths. Your favorite guys will suffer permanent injuries. I love it; it really gives that classic XCOM feel that your soldiers, no matter how good, are just one tactical error away from sudden death. Bad luck matters, too, but I really feel most of the time that I simply could have been more careful, could have had a better squad arrangment of skills and weapons that would have won the battle without the dreadful cost.

There are minor quibbles here and there. It took me a little while to figure out how to get contracts; at first I didn't see the little icons for them in towns, so I was just wandering the countryside having random encounters. There's no real overall story (yet), and it's not clear what if anything the different relations with different towns and noble houses are really doing. Chasing enemies down on the strategic map can be painful (why can't I just click on the icon and have my band follow theirs automatically, as long as they are in sight?), and how come I can apparently swim across the ocean? But these are quibbles, and do little to detract from the fun.

As far as I'm concerned, this is already a minor masterpiece. The writing for the encounters is actually worth reading. You start to care for your people, and their backgrounds actually have story effects as well as mathematical ones. Having a former peddler, or thief, or brawler can give extra options in encounter choices. What does that ""witchhunter"" background do? Unfortunately, I don't know yet, because that recruit was spitted on a pike in his first battle. But you can bet I'll be watching to recruit another.

If the strategic map and developments (noble houses fighting one another, external invasions of orcs and undead) come in as expected, this will transform from a minor masterpiece into a major one.

In most other games your characters are padded with extra stats and will stomp the enemy with next to no trouble. The complainers have just been coddled with these games.

In battlebrothers your units are:
weak
expendable
unique
with few to no advantages over the enemy units at start
and definitely going to die!
but they have potential

It's an open world and your comapany will flourish or die by your strategy. When your units are just as shi-tty as the enemies (or moreso) it comes rawly to how effectively you can maneuver your troops for the [sometimes blood-soaked] win.

49,25527337,english,"I currently have 145 games on my Steam account, and this is the first review I've bothered to write. After spending over 200 hours on this excellent and relatively cheap game, I thought that it deserved a recommendation. I can only think of a couple of games that I've ever spent more time playing.

This game does not feel like early access. I've only experienced one bug. It caused a crash. I reported it and the devs fixed it the same day and released a patch the next day. I havn't seen any other bugs.

The game has a very nice atmosphere. The events and missions are well written. They sometimes present you with difficult choises, often without any clear ""correct"" answer. What if this guy is lying? What if he's telling the truth?

The game is challenging. Combat is exciting and dangerous. Be prepared to see several of your favourite brothers die. When they do, just hire some new brothers. You'll grow to like the recruits soon enough. Maybe they'll even live longer than their predecessors.

I used to think that the character progression was not well implemented. That has been improved in the latest patch. You can now chose 3 stats to improve on levelup, and the perk system has been completely redone. I noticed some negative reviews because of the previous system. Some of the reviewers had spent considerable time playing. How can you not recommend a game that has entertained you for 50 hours even if you don't like one small part of it?

Now my only complaint is the lack of purpose or long term goals in the late game. When you have a full warband with good gear and several levels, you could always try to improve them further but I feel that I'd like something else to motivate me at that point. This may be improved when faction wars are implemented. It'll take you a long time to get to that point, and the journey is worth the money.

This is not only a great game, also the devs are reliable and release updates which really deserve the name update, as the game gets better with every single one of them, and there are still a lot of planned features and the game is yet already in it's current status highly enjoyable.

[u][b]Long Version:[/b][/u]
[b]Gameplay within battles:[/b]
The gameplay within a battle may seem like chess, but it isn't. Although, you have to be very tactical and there is no allround tactic or armory which will get you through every fight.
Ever tried to take down an Orc Warrior with a spear? With untrained mercenarys this may take a while, if you are still alive after a few minutes.

Now for a goblin is small and hard to hit, a spear gives a bonus to hitchance, you might want to switch from your armor breaking wepaons you used for orcs in the battle before to weapons which may make less damage, but have a better chance to hit.

[b]Gameplay at the real time map:[/b]
Now, that you won a battle you find your company in the open world. For every game you start, the worldmap is automatically generated. Wait, no no, don't think somethink wrong! You may think this can't go well, a automatic generated world. But I can tell, you it works, and it works pretty well!

On the worldmap, you can move to settlements, places to raid, or just venture through the area and search for roaming enemies, or not, you are free to do what you want.

[b]Weapons, armor, wardogs:[/b]
Yes you read correct, wardogs. Now a wardog isn't a very strong fighter, but it is extremely fast and can move further than your mercenaries. Perfect to catch fleeing enemies. Dogs need something to chew on too and they love some tasty goblin.

[b]Weapons;[/b]
Ranging from crude clubs up to high quality weapons as noble swords. For thebrutes of you, there are also huge two-handed axes and for the safe style players you also got weapons that aren't perfect in the amount of damage they deal, but in their general chance to hit.
Personal favorites: Crossbow, Billhook, Greatsword and Noble Sword.

[b]Armor;[/b]
Have an archer behind the frontlines? Give him some cloth amror like a gambeson to keep him fit for reloading the corssbow or firing multiple enemy shots. The lighter the armor, the less protection but the more fatigue. Fatigue is vital (like pretty much everything else too).
Heavy armor fatigues someone faster than light armor, being too fatigued means your brother isn't able to perform an action. So you have to find a good balance or train a character very strong. If you manage to keep him alife long enough. ;)
Personal favorites again: Nasal Helmet with Mail, Padded Kettle Hat, Direwolf Hide Armour (it's as awesome as it sounds), Mail Hauberk and Reinforced Mail Hauberk.
As this is an early acces review, it will probably be updated later on.

----

And now something besides the game itself, the community here on steam, as well as on their website, is a kind one, as far for now, I did not encounter trolls, spammers, or aggressive and unfriendly people.

So: Keep up your excellent work and I already see this game in the future in a ""Hall of Fame"". :)

Most of the things I did not orginally like about the game have been smoothed over.  It still seems at first glance to be a pretty dull game.  But once you start making some progress and start to understand your enemies as well as the strengths and weaknesses of your own troops this game gets pretty fun.

The best game I can compare it to is X-Com.   You manage your company and roam the map on a strategic level.   Then when you get into combat you will go to a tactical screen.   The armor, weapons, and individual troops can be managed on a strategic level.   Those decisions will have a huge effect on combat and should compliment the tactics you prefer.  Different kinds of enemies including goblins, orcs, human bandits, and the undead will force you to use different tactics.  Thus keeping every battle from being the same.   The AI has a knack for finding your weak spots and exploiting them.  So having a firm grasp of what your own weaknesses are can sometimes mean the difference between an overwhleming victory and a catstrophic disaster.

69,25969799,english,"Positives:
+ Atmosphere. It's a mostly gritty and cruel world and the dialogue is well written, with a dark sense of humour.
+ Characters. Each brother you hire has a unique combination of background, genetic traits and different bonuses to skills which they can learn more easily. You choose what they should focus on as they level up and there are plenty of interesting talent synergies. 
+ Strategic choices. Besides character customization, you also pick your battles and you have the opportunity to tweak your brothers' equipment based on your experience with the given fighting conditions and type of opponent.
+ Combat. The mechanics are good, the stakes are high and it's satisfying to see your plan pay off.

Negatives: (I'll try to keep this updated as the game is being developed)
- Can't see details about a brother before you hire them. You have to pay them a sum up front, only to immediately fire most of them because they're no good (if you wish to min/max).
- Difficult to know if you're strong enough to take on a given enemy type unil you've tried and failed. Brutal for a new player.
- Some game mechanics are really unclear until you read the wiki. Like what difference do the little stars you see on skills do, or what does a person's professional background matter, besides the skill adjustments? Why not show min/max rolls for different skills on level up?
- Too slow strategic map movement. It needs a fast forward mode, with auto-pause on enemy sighted, for example.

Despite being in early access I have not come across a single bug or crash. One time it hung while loading, but thats the extent of the technical issues. 

The game consists of two parts, an overland exploration part where you go from town to town performing contracts for local lords and the battle phase. Battle is clearly the focus of the game and is where it really shines. Different weapons have different abilities, different armor is either heavier or lighter, and your men all have backgrounds and skills that determine thier capabilities. Seeing a plan come together and gradually routing a force that is far superior to your own is hugely satisfying.

The ""fantasy"" element is very under-accented and its perhaps what draws me in the most. From what I can see there is no way for you to access magic yourself and you generally only see fantastical elements in the forces you fight, Necromancers, vampires, direwolves, and the undead. But from time to time you will gain an artifact item. They are unnaturally light or strong or whatever, but being so rareis what really makes you treasure finding them.

The game is still in early access and it shows in a few ways. There is no overarching goal, and while i personally prefer it that way the late game certainly feels a bit listless at times. There are also some slight balancing issues, where for example a long axe has a reach of two and can oneshot most enemies, but an equally pricey long bow is basically useless unless wielded by a master bowman and even then it dramatically underperforms against armor. For the most part the dev has stated that all these issues will be adressed, and I believe them.

All the weapons have a function to them besides attacking, it makes the gameplay more strategic, also the terrain is varied and every section has a tactical plus or minus to it.

Now, the game... 

It's a turn based strategy game with a level of RPG that might not be the most inmersive but it surely makes the player feel involved in the story. Gameplay wise it's pretty straight forward, without excesive menus, inventoy tabs, abilities or commands that may scare more casual players away.

Yet it has some complexity to it, with a definitively strong strategy element and a brutal learning curve. Your company will probably get slaughtered again and again until you get the hand of it. It is so rewarding when your men return without casualties from a mission, or when you manage to save your most valuable brother from the fangs of certain death.

Another great asset is the artistic style of the game, which is very unique and nice looking. The models are hand drawn and very detailed, and you'll probably end up trying to collect every gear piece just for the looks.

Gameplay wise, and even if it's a turn based game, feels very agile and enjoyable, with a very nice interface and level design. The campaign map is randomly generated, something that makes every game feel more unique. It has a functional economy going, and actions have consequences, much like in M&B series.

Overall, it is a great choice for enjoyment, I'd recommend it again and again.

In Darkest Dungeon, after finishing each mission you will have to manually micromanage your squad to heal their debuff at 3 different places with many different healing methods.
It might looks complex and realistic at first, but when you have to micromanage your squad at healer places  every time after your participate a mission it becomes a boring chore, and the service fees are extremely expensive that you have to spend 10-15 mins playing a disposable squad to find money to heal your main squads.
 
Fortunately, there is no such thing in Battle Brothers, you don't have to micromanage people in healing mechanic.

Pros
- very complex battle system (skills,terrain,equipment modifiers,character traits)  
- Nice atmosphere, while DD have a dark atmosphere, Battle Brothers seem to have brutality of medieval world.
- day/night circle
- Great ambient sound, I love the nature sound I hear when the game turn to night
- many things to customize for characters
- some fantasy aspect like Orc, Undead, wardog
- interesting random events (I enjoy it like those events in FTL)
- reading characters background is fun
- outside combat, player only need to manage things in a big picture(Total amount of food, repairing tool, medicine, money, random event choices)

Neutral
- Characters is more disposable than Darkest Dungeons, they die a lot
- Combat is very hard, I need to load my save files to retry a battle again most of the time 

Cons
- no option for map panning speed. I have a minor issue of motion sickness, I need to see things in a right speed so that I won't get dizzy.

- No female characters (I know this game mostly aim to satisfy core gamer who never interested in flashy stuff like female characters, but I think adding some fancy choices like female sellsword wouldn't disappoint them much, it's 2016 we all know that many gamers enjoy to have female characters in their beloved games, that's why we can see Ciri Samus Mercy Quiet D.Va  Ellie Elizabeth all over the internet)

- music is a bit sad. I enjoy natural sound in this game, but I think the background music make me feel depress.

Personal wish
- Female characters (yep, i'm those kind of gamer)
- non-human playable characters (but not some boring and repetitive being like dwarf or elves )
- more terrifying enemies like creatures from hell
- tons of random events
- option for map panning speed

This great game is worth the money. Yes I sad it before I even got into it. Now, there are 3 elements to this niche game that I would like to highlight.


Firstly the global map inspired from M&B where u can free roam and get yourself in al sort of trouble. Secondly turn based combat that’s closest to the chees board game with its well established and polished rules of engagement. This element is the core of the combat system of this game. Thirdly the dark, gritty and unforgiving troop management that resembles Darkest Dungeon which would appeal to a lot of hard-core turn based players. 


Combined all three and we get extremely well-polished game that is still in early access stage. It has great potential and hopefully the developers keep adding new content to it. It's clear that they put a lot of effort into it, just look at the hand-drawn characters.  


My only gripe with the game is the lack of activity on the global map but the developers seem to be on top of it already, quote: - more lively and dynamic world, with more opportunities for you to shape it, and more relation between what is going on in the world and contracts on offer.-


I would caution younger players and players new to the turn-based games. It’s definitely not as fast paced as some of the AAA tittles out there, but it’s has depth and rewards that come with the time spent with it. 
This product is definitely worth the money and I would recommend to all my comrades!

The perk system revision that occured in September 2016 has really mixed things up. It seems like there is variety to be had in terms of skill choices, and you need to think carefully about the skill synergies (if you can keep your troops alive). There are more contracts now, and to me it feels as if the game has gotten just a bit harder.

I'm playing veteran difficulty. I've been wiped a few times and have had to readjust my tactics and strategies in order to survive. This is a great game, if you find the style and pacing to be your cup of tea!

___

This is a great game, even if in early access state. I find it bloody hard... and infuriating and rewarding and excellent! The story is not in place, but the writing in the little snippets you see in character bios and events is quite good.

It won't appeal to everyone, but the limited overworld map gives me enough fun/distraction between the battles to keep things from getting boring. The game is really in the battles, and the highs and lows of how they turn out.

Basically You start off with a few Mercs. Mercs have different backgrounds comes with different skill sets and have different hiring cost daily ranging from sellswords 1 of the best to the cheapest farmer etc. Everyone has its own use find the right combination in the beginning and start hiring the better ones slowly. Tons of equipments around for you to loot and purchase in town as well. Items will also randomly appear and dissappear for you to purchase so do Mercs in Towns. 

Missions for you to accept or refuse to earn money and loots as well and xp.

It is an early access game but I have the utmost confidence in the developers. They have a project with a goal. Nothing too ambitious and at the same time it is not underwhelming. They take their time while working at a timely pace.

As for the game itself, Battle Brothers is a Turn Based Strategy game about managing a company of mercenaries in a high fantasy setting with bandits, goblins, orcs and even zombies (among other things). It has a leveling system that works by character as well as a permadeath system. You gain loot, exp, and gold from completeing missions or clearing out enemy bases that randomly spawn on a radomly generated map. As you complete missions you gain reputation with the various factions generated with the map. If you fail missions you lose reputation.

The interface: It is clear and easy to grasp, the game is so simple to get into it barely needs a tutorial. Buttons are clearly labeled and inventory management has a sorting option, making it a breeze to go through your stash.

The combat: The combat is almost like a mix between your standard TBS game and chess. There really aren't many animations and the characters are 2D game pieces. It has various weapons and fighting styles as well as skills that characters gain as they level up. So far it is balanced but not equal in that there is balance, but each enemy has a different fighting style that you have to adapt to. It can take a lot of trial and error if you don't read a guide (which I do not personally consider a bad thing)

The AI: I am actually very impressed with the AI. Human enemies are fairly unpredictable, goblins are sneaky opportunists, while orcs use brute force and shock and awe. It puts you on the spot to choose a fighting style and formation to fit the type of enemy.

Graphics: They are on the low side. If 2D characters over a hex background are a dealbreaker for you, this game may not tickle your fancy the way it did for me and many others. They are smooth and demand very little however. Most up to date computers should be able to run this game with no problems. While it is 2D I actually enjoy the art style used for characters and weapons.

Cons: My only real gripes are the lack of story, lack of depth in the faction system, and repetitiveness. While I have a lot of fun with this game, it is easy to slip into a grind where you are running missions just to replace the men and equipment you lost on the previous mission.

Overall: This is probably my favorite game this year so far. I have had a great deal of fun with this game and look forward to what is to come of it.

Updated Review: Battle Brothers continues to go from strength to strength, with improved maps, graphics, interactions and newly added features like taverns, reserve mercernaries and balance changes to creatures like goblins. A highly recommended buy, especially if you like your games with a sharp tactical edge and an even sharper level of challenge.

Updated Review #2: The inclusion of the brand new Injury mechanics has brought yet another dimension to an already enjoyable game. Your Battle Brothers can now get temporary and permenent injuries. Being struck down in battle before was an insta-kill.

Out of all the Early Access games out there that destory your faith in devs. This one is the saving grace for all of those. The dev actually care and keep you in the loop the whole time with week by week updates on progress of the game.

The game itself is not going to be for everyone. Keep in mind it is a turn base game. With heavy RNG factors. The actually game play is interesting as you lead your band of men around selling your sword to the highest bidder. It can also get a little boring in the mid-late game as you can feel you really dont have much of a purpose other than to just find enough money to pay your men.

43,25079396,english,"Great game that moves away from common Turn Based Tactics in medieval universe styles. Wonderful graphics, but you can see that. The combat mechanics are well thought out and usually when I lose I know I should have done something different, even if that means retreat at points. All battles are certainly not winnable which, to me, gives a real feel for being in a world that is dangerous and not made for console. It also gives you a real sense of achievement when you do become capable of beating what was once a scramble for dear life to the edge of the map.
Even in late game you are challenged as the late game enemies still require a strategy and thinking to defeat. Often I read people complaining about the late enemies being overpowered and I think it's just due to the fact they expect the late game to be easy as or easier than the beginning. Not that the beginning is easy, it's not. The late game can be harder if you haven't learned your lessons.

On the flip side of the coin, the game has it's flaws. Sometimes the AI doesn't hold up well, but it is a fringe case for me and not the norm. I'm writing this just before an update that addresses it, but some of the perks are definitely dominant over others. Also, although I don't believe the orcs in the game are overpowered, I do think the rewards for fighting them are not on par with the difficulty. They just don't drop enough loot and do too much damage for it to be worth it unless you have a specific mission that pays well.

48,25037380,english,"I like squad based tactical games like Jagged Alliance 1 and 2, Silent Storm, etc. Battle Brothers give the taste of those games in a low fantasy setting.
You start with 3 men, a few resources and try to make your way in a harsh world. I died a few times till I get the tactics and the mechanics of the game but after you learn the game winning a battle against a orc chieftain and his orcs are really satisfying.
The games survival mechanics are good imo. You have food, ammunition, medicine and tools for repairs and most important gold. Food takes inventory space and other resources have limited amounts you can carry. You need to watch them carefully since I have lost my good men while I was following some pesky goblins and couldnt restocked.
Your most important resource is your men. There are lots of different backgrounds and traits. At the start you wont be able to afford better backgrounds and have to rely farmers, hunters, woodcuters. Later if you can live after some succesful missions you can afford a squire or hedgeknight and you will see the difference in backgrounds. I have to change my last level farmhands with low level sellwords at the later part of the game because they rock.
There are lots of equipment. All types of medieval weapons and armor. They are modeled well. For example with spears you can make spear wall, maces stun the enemey, great swords can hit multiple enemies, etc. 
Also the developers updating the game frequently with great ideas.
There are lots of good things to say about this game. If you are fan of Jagged Alliance and like medieval times this game is for you.",1471716225,1471716225,True,10,0,0.528139114379882813,0,True,False,True,76561198063273288,756,13,19099,0,5392,1597607570,,
49,25030660,english,"This is a good turn based game that I usually play when I'm between big games. I bought this game right away when it was in much earlier access so I've been along for the ride and I've seen a lot of improvements over time that have really made me revisit this game more than I used to. I will add though that I don't think this game is worth twenty dollars, it's about a seventeen dollar game. I know three dollars isn't a huge price change, but I'm trying to give you an accurate scale of what you can expect from this game. 
First off, the one thing that makes this game is the fact that you can name your characters. If you have friend over at your hourse, this can be a very entertaining experience. With my best friend, I named a lot of characters after our friends and seen how long each of us could survive. We did pretty well, until we got cocky and tried fighting a band of orcs who literally, in one turn mid-way through the battle, decapitated five of us surrounding the leader orc. My best friend and I literally paused watching the screen and then you heard five sword swings and five heads fly off in the span of five seconds. We looked at each other and then burst out laughing because of the disbelief and because we knew we were screwed. Naming the characters is the most clever thing that although simple, adds so much to the atmosphere. I would not play this game at all if you could not name your characters. When I'm alone, I often play as characters from Crusader Kings 2 with the Game of Thrones mod, particularly Ironborn characters and then what I do, to make the game challenging, is I make the characters have to pay the iron price for their gear. In other words, I don't buy any weapons or clothing. You pay for the new recruits and then from there, they can only get gear from characters that they have personally killed. You usually need a notepad to be able to keep track of the gear and  who killed who, but you really do feel like your ironborn raiders go from men with knifes to ironborn killers with better weapons and armor that they earned from corpses they made. King Balon Greyjoy would be proud.
Another feature they added to the game is the noble families and the reputation meters that each family has. For example, whenever I start a new game, there are three families in an area like the Starks, the Lannisters, and the Baratheons (those aren't their real names, I'm just creating an example). They will show you four male members of the family, I pretend that the first family member to the left is the Lord in power and then the other three are the next three male members in the line of succession. For example there's an old guy furthest to the left who's the lord, a younger guy to the right who's the Lord's son (I pretend, I'm making up a backround story for these characters). Then another old guy who's in the third slot who's probably the lord's brother and next to him in the fourth slot is another young guy, who is likely the brother's son. You will interact with these family members when they try to recruit you for a job. Sometimes you will even negotiate with the lord himself. Each of these families will be given a bio that tells a bit about the family. For example, the Starks are a strong family that hold up traditions, but have currently fallen on hard times and some of their land due to disputes with the Lannisters. These bios affect transactions for missions that they'll recruit you to do. For example, since they have fallen on hard times, they will likely have you do more violent jobs, however, they might not be able to pay you as much since they're not in a powerful position right now. That's why you find yourself working for people like the Lannisters, more commonly, and you'll gain a reputation for it. 
The turn based combat is relatively fun and simple. It didn't take long to learn and I think the developer is adding a bit of a story to the game, although, I don't really pay much attention to it, to be honest. I like interacting with the noble families more. It's more exciting to gain reputation with them as the ironborn and build a team of well equiped ironborn with all sorts of different gear.
The game does have flaws though. The number one thing that annoys me is that there aren't enough spaces in the top naming portion of the characters menu so I have to use the bottom naming section to get the characters full name. I used to use the bottom part to assign titles like Iron Captain, but you really can't if the name takes it up. You can't name a character Victarion Stonehouse and expect it to fit in the top naming section. My other complaint is that there is no female characters. I'm not a feminazi or anything, but I just want to play as Asha Greyjoy (who I imagined looked like a slim Christina Hendricks with the same sized breasts, just tucked into her padded armor, while reading the books). I can't do this in the game's current form. I would hope that this changes because Asha Greyjoy is my second favorite female character in Game of Thrones. Also, more barber shops. I hate running across the map looking for barber shops to customize my characters. There should be too many barber shops. They should be like Starbucks in this game. Every town should have a barber shop and they should have barber shops in the middle of the forest and on the roads, and on top of mountains, etc. 
Overall, this is a good game that incites that one more turn or thing to do feeling other people get from Civilization V. When I start the game, I usually play it for at least three or four hours because I always tell myself that I'll just change my gear and then it's off to bed. And then maybe I should get some new recruits before bed. Then I'm unhappy with the new guy's gear so I go on a mission to get better gear. And a recruit died so I have to go get some new ones. Then I found a cool new mission where this noble family wants me to kill some weak bandits with good gear and they'll pay me lots of gold to do it and I don't want to stop because the mission might not be there the next time I start up. And so then I kill the bandits, but I'm running low on food and this town doesn't have any so I have to go up the road to get some fish and then I happen to see......",1471692517,1471692517,True,2,0,0,0,True,False,True,76561198227931596,56,12,4049,0,2028,1518143638,,

As i played games like Mount & Blade: Warband, i expected a game kinda like that. And i got it. Which I like, because its just awesome. Open world roaming with quests and a crew that is unique as much as it can be.
Now I payed 20bucks for the game and only 5 for Mount & Blade. This game tho is very new, not even released yet, but the problem I am having is that there is no real depth in it.
The graphics are nice and probably not too hard to put time into it and so is the gameplay. But even Mount & Blade offered way more things than battle brothers does.
Do I miss something? To me it seems like you are a group that is just going from town to town to do quests with low variety to maintain your crew and equip them.
I love the idea behind that but is that it? I am curious because some have played this game for way more than 500 hours already.

70,22625950,english,"What a gem!

This early access title feels anything but.  It has a polished feel from the get-go.

Standard turn-based tatical combat is enhanced by a unique art-style.  Characters are represented as head and torsos on a base, like a board game piece.  This allows for more facial characteriscs to be easily visible, and each character has a unique look.  This allow for immediate recognition of the individual characters, and along with the rpg aspects and varied character background blurbs, allows you to quickly get attached to individual characters in this squad based game. Weapons, armor, HP, armor, morale, and stances are all visible right on the character, and as wounds and morale change, the character's sprite appears more wounded, scared, pale etc.  nice touch.  

The combat itself is smooth with nice animations that are pleasing.  all the standard turn-based combat tropes are present (height advantage, line of sight, ranks, tanks, archers etc).  there is no magic that I know of in the game.  Characters have various traits like wildmen who fight better with a 1-hander with a free hand, beggars who have low resolve, flaggelets who have enhance fatigue (endurance), fisherman who come with an entanging net, etc. You need to level up characters, but you can always have some cheap chaff units up front (though you quickly get attached even to these).  you need variety, some characters need maces to damage high armor, battle axes to break shields, tanks to build shield and spear walls, polearms for second rank attacks etc.  retreating from battle feels too easy, but I think I've had severely wounded characters not make it out (not sure how to tell when that will happen).  (EDIT: if you get to the edge of the map you escape, otherwise it's random)

The world  map is pretty and easy to manuver, though land travel is a bit slow, and so far the game is mostly comprised of completing quests, exploring, and gearing up/leveling up.  there is no base building, though that would be a cool addition.  

The turn-based combat is good enough to carry the game and the attachment to characters keeps you going.  there is even a simple trading mechanic where an item has an eastily visible given value, but what it will sell or buy for varies from town to town in a rational manner based on that town's local resources and attitute towards you I think you can attack caravans and peasants as well but I haven't tried that.

77,24422890,english,"This is the first game I've ever written a review for in the 12 years I've been using steam.
This game is absolutely amazing, it's quickly become one of my top 5 favorite games. When the development is finished I have high expectations that this game will be amazing.

Battle Brothers is a turn-based squad style sandbox game. Really the best way to describe this game is a turn-based mount and blade. The medieval sandbox gameplay is similar in both. However, this game is still in development and is still missing quite a few features. In towns you cannot yet access the temple or veteran's halls, for example.

When you start a new game it throws you into a battle immediately . 2/5 of your team is guaranteed to die during this battle. This initial battle is a quick tutorial to teach you the basics of the game.
After that battle you are free to roam around the world. The world has over a dozen towns and the towns are different in every new game that you play. A town's merchandise is produced from varying buildings around it that you can see on the map. Every new game these buildings change which has the effect of making the towns unique in every game. This affects what you're able to buy from the towns and the type of party members you can hire there.

Party members can permanently die in this game. A character must repair their gear after using their weapon in a battle or receiving damage in a battle. Your gear can break permanently if you do not keep up on it's repairs.

The gameplay has RPG elements and you are able to customize your squad members by choosing their skills and stats as they level up. You are able to have 18 members in your squad, but only 12 can be used in the battlefield at once. The others sit in a ""camp"" and regain HP and repair their gear. There's also unique gear that can be dropped from named enemies, and this gear is better than what you can buy in a town. This has led me to go out on hunts to get weapons I cannot find anywhere else.

There are factions in this game and becoming friendly with them allows you to hire better squad members and buy items cheaper. Having a faction as an enemy lets  you attack their units and towns. Each town has at least one faction in it, some towns have a second faction as well. The factions can give you quests. The quests are usually to go kill something or patrol an area, but occasionally they have you attack another town and destroy some of their buildings. If they are destroyed the town loses their ability to produce whatever the building was for (For example, destroying a Herbalist's grove will mean they can no longer create healing items). Besides the human towns there are Goblins, Orcs and Undead factions. These last 3 factions are hostile to everyone and this can lead to battles where there's 3 seperate factions fighting on the same field at once. You are encouraged to go look for groups on enemies and you can also find buildings throughout the map that randomly spawn. These buildings will belong to either Goblins, Orcs, Undeads or robbers and you can choose to fight them and get loot from these buildings. They spawn constantly around the map so there's always a place you can go to fight.


This game has a lot of potential. Even in it's unfinished state I've been having a lot of fun but there definitely will need to be some future updates to expand on ruling over a town. I really recommend this game if you want to help out the Dev while it's still in early access.

79,24315117,english,"I figured out my problem with this game.

Its not the economy, which is kinda trash.  4k gold for ONE sword, albeit the Noble Sword, best in the game so far for sword and board guys, but come on, 4k gold?  Thats 4 full contracts for ONE weapon.  The economy is kinda trash.  But 114 days in I have arming swords, kite shields and mail shirts with nasal helmets for my front liners, hunting bows, lammelar leather and hoods for my archers.  Not bad, but not really top of the line or best protection on anyone.

Its not the randomness of the combats.  One contract Im fighting 12 bandits, not to hard, not to easy.  Next combat Im getting paid half of what I was paid for the bandits, but fight 32 ghouls and 2 necromancers.  Thats to random, and not really risk/reward worthy in any sense of the means.

Its not the complete lack of formations - which absolutely ruins any idea that your a merc company with any sort of organization whatsoever.  When I get attacked by 14 goblin worgriders, dont even get me started on how overly powerful and broken those are, why are my archers out front?  The worgriders just fly upto my archers, kill them, then the combat is over before it even starts.  Not to mention that most times you get those ambushers who have poison. which blind your archers and men, and take away a ton of stats.  Its not just unfair, its completely lopsided.  And I get paid 2000 crowns for that fight, but lose 10 men, most of my equipment and so on.  

The thing that gets me about the game is the fact I dont have a character myself.  They keep coming and talking to me, telling me they want to shoot to see who is the best, nevermind neither of the contestants are actually my archers.  I get drunks falling on arrows, and random people coming to tell me stories.  Who AM I?  Why cant I make my guy at the beginning of a new game, and actually be a piece on the board?  This is a glaring omission to me.

All in all I like the game, its overly hard, not at all fair but kinda addicting.

If you save often enough the game can be a blast, if you dont?  Well be prepared to lose hours of work as your troops are mowed down by orc warriors, goblin worgriders and vampires.  Be prepared to push that red X on certain contracts.  If you go to the site to find 14 goblin worgriders, 4 ambushers etc and they have an ambush prepared?  Just reload the save and X that stupid mission.

Archers are somewhat key to the game, as there range allows you to form a shield wall and actually fight like a military unit.  Get ambushed or lose initiative?  Your screwed for the most part.

I like this game and will give it a thumbs up, but still needs work, which is why its beta.

EDIT: 200 Day renew.  After 200 days I have a group of 12 merc's with some decent abilities, level 5 to level 10.  The traits you get as you level are pretty cool, and definitly make a difference.  BUT. 

BUT.  Screw us players when we want to fight orcs and goblin wolf riders.  They are redicilous.  My toughest, best guys dont stand a chance.  Wolfriders get to move over half the map, then they have 3 attacks, and they always go first.  Orcs can push your guys out of there line 2 or 3 times at a turn, and then do major damage.  While also being able to take huge amounts of damage.

If you only take undead and bandit missions, your good to go.  If you dont, then you better have a sweet, sweet setup.  Heavy armor, heavy shields, I suggest the orc ones and big blades.

Right now there are to many imbalances.  And not enough bonus's for the players.  There is no training, lose your entire team to a group of orcs?  Yep, gotta either pay 5 to 10k for new, high level troops, or basically start all the way over.

YOU have no character, your just kinda...there.  People come to you and say stuff to you and stop you on the road and on and on.  But YOU are not really there.  I have no link to my troops, there just there.

Theres so much that this game could do.

1. Make your own hero, the actual captain, in a M&B type scenario choosing all sorts of things.
2. Training of some sort.  Hire 10 farmers and train them up before putting them in the front lines.
3. Better balance - right now some enemies are so much more powerful then the player that its just not fun.
4. Better pricing and market costs OR make the really expensive swords, armor and so on do much more.  Right now you dont see much of a difference between Arming Swords and Noble Swords.
5. Stats for your guys - Id like to know how many orcs and goblins Sigmund the former farmer has.
6. Formations - Why this was left out is beyond me.  Tactical, turn based combat that completely falls apart because my archers are out front for the orcs and goblins to eat.",1468504745,1468893017,True,3,2,0.5,0,True,False,True,76561197976493056,199,8,10331,0,3247,1594833879,,

81,24393895,english,"TL;DR: you can equip dogs and send them to auto-attack the enemies, what other innovations do you need from turn-based strategy?!

Global map view with factions and relations reminds me of Mount & Blade series. There's a party management aspect and you have to maintain the balance of gold, food, medicine and ammunition.

The tactical battle is complex and has a lot of interesting rules like zones of controls. As far as I played battle abilities mostly depend on the weapons equipped and include area-effect hits. 

It's also unforgiving. And unless you are slow and armored, you are quite easy to kill and if happens - it's permanent. Not if you have '9 lives' perk which allows to die once in a battle. So this game is a lot about risk management and picking the right fights.

There's no classes, you only have some perks and attributes, like melee and ranged skill and you can have them both. And sometimes it seems reasonable to have a hybrid class who can throw a bunch of javelins and then go to fight in melee range. There's also interesting balance between tankiness and damage dealing. The more armor you get the more fatigue you accumulate and eventually get less action points in combat and you also go down the intitiative list. And until you have levelled up the stats of your soldiers it doesn't make sense to put expensive stuff with a lot of armor on them.

Now on what I didn't like. The map with different heights looks messy, while not giving any interesting gameplay abilities. As of now (July 2016), the game seems lacking content: items, buildings, variety in quests and global goals. Basing on that, I can't advise to buy it now, come back in 6 to 12 months or so.

82,24351572,english,"Battle Brothers is a turn-based tactics and management game with strong RPG elements set in a charming randomly generated low fantasy world. You lead a band of up to 18 (with 12 fighting at a time) charmingly characterized but utterly expendable mercenaries from contract to contract, outfitting them with new gear, learning new skills, and overseeing rations, pay and supplies for your company. Overworld gameplay is not unlike the Mount & Blade series, but tactical battles play more like a highly modified game of chess. The (mainly self-guided) campaign manages to toe that fine, fun line of brutality resulting in an experience that is both challenging and rewarding to play. 

Development is still ongoing, but it is of note that the developers are very forthcoming with updates, both actual content and explanations of the dev process and their roadmap for the finished game.

87,24204817,english,"Game specifics aside for the moment, I would like to mention how invested the developers appear to be in this title. I have enjoyed (and continue to enjoy) a constant stream of new and exciting material in the short time I have been playing this game. With every patch there are quick bug fixes, showing consideration for the players and really polishing what is already a thoroughly enjoyable game.

There are still many options in game, such as the Veteran's Hall, that appear in towns but are not available until a future patch. 

I learnt very quickly as a mercenary captain not to become too attached to my men... of course, I will always have my favourites! This game is challenging in all the right ways with well-balanced rewards. I spent almost 40 hours on this title before I saw my first named weapon, though admittedly I wasn't always checking armouries. I find tremendous satisfaction upon defeating a particularly challenging encounter. 

There is plenty of variety with missions, which is the best way to earn your pay, and always negotiate for the best price! Of course you can always head out on your own and explore the huge map, which is randomly generated for each game. Perhaps you might stumble across an old decrepit fortress with a host of Wiedergangers (zombies) and maybe even a Necromancer or two. Or you might charge into a Goblin camp only to find they tricked you into an ambush and you must fight your way out while surrounded!
Trade is also a viable option to make some coin.

The turn based combat is incredibly enjoyable and you need to use every tactical advantage you can to prevail. See your men’s weapons begin to bloody as they score hit and watch in horror as their armour and helmets deteriorate as they take punishment, until your men themselves begin to bruise and bleed as they are injured. 

The build trees are decent, I find there are essentially a few 'go too' perks such as Colossus which increases HP by %25 for each character that takes it, which is every one of my men. You really think about each man and his stats and where he can best serve when deciding if he will be part of your defensive wall, or an archer, or perhaps using a two tile weapon like a Billhook and fill a useful supporting roll, or maybe be a 2 handed damage dealing monster wielding a Greataxe. 
I find balancing income an enjoyable challenge. You constantly need to stock supplies like food, tools, arrows/bolts, and bandages. Of course you also need to pay your men. 

Each man comes with his own specific traits, so while you might have a remarkable fighter who has great melee skill he might also be short sighted, or superstitious. Traits have minor and sometimes moderate impacts to your men that keeps things unique and enjoyable. One of my men was gluttonous which means he consumes more food (3units per day instead of 2) and shortly after became fat giving him extra HP but lowering his max fatigue, oddly enough though after a few weeks he managed to lose the extra weight and lost the fat trait. Many traits give positive benefits too, being brave will increase your resolve, or athletic will reduce the amount of fatigue it takes to move each tile.

I always find something new to do in this game and have started over multiple times already. I play on challenging and I find that level of difficulty is aptly named. 
My 'Iron Wolves' were decimated by warrior orcs, killed to a man. The 'Crimson Blades' fared little better but the 'Blood Griffons' have learnt by their predecessor’s mistakes and are making a name for themselves throughout the land. You may cringe at my corny mercenary band names if you wish, really, my only other idea was ‘The Princess Brides’.


TL;DR – A thoroughly enjoyable game with a vast amount of content, great strategizing, good challenge/reward ratio, and enjoyable character development.

89,24170470,english,"This game is really addicting. Theres a lot of variety between weapons and armor which permit any customizations you can dream of. The ""Fatigue"" factor is great because it keeps you within the boundaries of reason when creating/developing/customizing your Battle Brothers. If you want to make a Brother a Uber Steel Tank that know one can hurt. Well good luck your likely to gas out and become vulnerable due to reduced stamina cuase of the heavy armor. 
This game is great it probably should be called Battle ""Expendables"" as it can be quite often your brothers die in battle as is common in war. You can hire/fire, taken any job you like , get paid per head claimed/killed, paid in advance (then cancel the contract cheating >:( the client ), protecting caravans, huntings bountys and lairs, etc... You can make your entire units bow rangers, or pike/spearmen or axe weilding berserkers, and much more. After battle you heal up, repair weapons due to battle wear. Also level up and pick from 3 diffrent skill trees. Battle Brothers also have unique backgrounds that can give them positive or negative traits that impact their character development. You can hire farmers, fishermen, miners, vagabonds, militia, dethroned nobles, jesters and many more all triggerring intresting diaglogues during missions.
Theres also plenty of interesting dialogue when communicating with clients and some random (while on missions) dialouge depending on your battle brothers Background. This is a good game with a lot of potential and I highly recommend it for strategy and rpg enthusiasts.

Things I would like to see.

1. COMMANDER. The company leader is only refered to but not available to play. It be cool to play a ""Hero/Commander"" Class thats the face of the Company of Sellswords. Possibly have a unique skilltree that affects things outside battle and in. Ambush, Premptive Stike and/or selection of formations, Bartering (discounts and contract negotiations), chance to save a fallen brother, See more of map, travel faster, Battle boosts, negatives effects if comander is ""incapacitated"" sommon he can never die he is the commander after all or is can he.

2. BATTLE SISTERS with unique stats?

3. More options for avatar customization. More Faces, tatoos, beards, and possibly add SCARS, ACCESSORIES (eyepatch,etc..), SKIN COLOR.

4. GORE!!!! War is brutal. lets see a selectable Option for blood and guts and possibly even the possibility to lose body part/s but still fight and maybe bleed out or potentially survive.

5. More unique weapons, usable pets like similar to wardogs.

6. HORSES, for faster travel on land in mini Map.

7. CARAVAN ability to upgrade your caravan to carry more items, ammo, medical supplies, and repair

8. SPECIALIZATIONS. Be intresting to see Field Medics, Spearmen, Men at Arms, Trackers//Hunters, etc... with both positive and negatives stats/benefits for balance.

9. SELFSUFICIENT.   Being able to hunt/forage for your own food. Possibly a unique Commander Skill.

96,24062619,english,"This game is really boring and bugged! 
-	Gameplay is so slow you almost fall asleep. 
-	The hit statistics in the game appear to be complete BS.
I quit playing early because it was so bad and I wanted to make sure I was able to get it refunded before I used up the allotted time.

I play three times and was wiped every time when I attempted to kill the bandit guy.
-	The first time I only hired one extra guy, not three as recommended, as I wanted a challenge. I wiped but just thought, awesome a game the is not easy. I never even landed a single blow in this battle.
-	Second time I followed the recommendations of the game and hired three and equipped them as recommended. I wiped again, but noticed I was not able to hit, only landing one hit the entire battle despite having some tooltips reporting over a 50% hit change.
-	I tried a third time, hiring four guys, and equipping them well. I played a lot more strategically, yet wiped again, only managing to hit five times. This one was enough to make me go for the refund. My archer guy was reporting a 58% hit chance yet he hit all of one time, I even ran him out of ammo. 

If a game is going to give you hit chance percent before you do an attack, it should damn well use that hit chance percent. Most my attacks where above a 30% hit chance, many over 50%, yet all in all I ended up with under a 5% hit. Using the in game hit % presented on the tooltip, missing as much as I did, would be a once in a several Trillion chance! Possible yes, but this more likely shows the game is bugged or the developers are purposely presenting false information.

Oddly, in a sharp contrast to the opening battle, on all three plays I was hitting 100% of the time.

This is my absolute favorite game of 2015, continuing 2016? 

While a lot of people might crowd to the ""has potential"" sort of appeal, this game really is great: as is.
Sure there is always ""more to follow"", yet if the entire development tean suffered from an all sync  megamind stroke, this game would remain at the heart of tactical, turn based awesomness. 

What is this user unfriendly permadeath?:
In this game it's not unforgiving, rather it makes you as the player invest emotions, have favourites among your company of mercs. It creates suspense when going toe to toe with harder odds. At the best of times, a well liked character will become food for crows. 

TBS was a 90's thing they said:
Whomever said that was a cynic and a fool. There's always someone new, young or old to the gaming world. Jaded gamers or hormone flatlined youngbloods don't dictate what's enjoyable: you do.
 It's like saying Kurosawa Akira lost his spark after Mifune left or vice cersa.
Just oppiniond and words in the wind.

Turn Based Combat?:
 works very well. There is no time limit nor preassure. The TBS takes place when you face the enemy on the field of battle. You have a real time pausable overview map, that is used for moving your ragged band of soldiers from city to city, missino to mission. Yet the battle itself does play out turn per turn, death by death. Even with all the time in the world, it's never slow, nor is it hard to control. Simple system, with large room for devestating setbacks. Move your men, issue attacks. Use special skills like aimed shot, or shield wall. Stamina and armor, these are just a brief few sentances to explain the surface content of what this game really is: A vast open playground for your imagination.  

If you look past the cute-ish way the art is depicted, it's really just cause and effect with (Myth) Soulblighter-grittyness, only so far dreamt of customizability of gear (for what it is), with a light hearted leveling system that you won't see much of because your darlings will die, kind of well worth your money-fun-time.

People get paid to write reviews, and others have a skill for it. I on the other hand, am niether. 
I'm also a bit drunk at the moment so don't expect none typos.

Not having enjoyed many games as of late, this really hit the spot.

-----------
Good combat system that makes you think.

Easy on the eye Graphics and a nice world map.

No hand holding death is death unless your a pussy and load saved games.

Challanging even on normal diffculty.

Affection for your soldiers...yep every loss really hurts.

CONS
-------------

Ranged Damage seems a bit weak for the player to many ways to be blocked and and some maps make ranged damage impossable.

Music is really annoying and needs to be worked on imho.


Overhall this is a solid game there are no bugs or crashes and im sure it will only get better as the Devs really care for there baby , Pricewise its a good bargin and even thou i picked it up cheap im going to pay full price with the add on support the devs.......

Good Game 8/10

* A medieval setting with low-fantasy elements
* Customisable Units with their own quirks and traits, including backrounds that impact upon their skills
* Commanding a small band of units, whilst ensuring you keep enough food, money, items etc to keep them going
* A game system with a fair but tough rule set that is easy to understand and learn

The Early Access iteration is stable and filled with enough content to keep players engaged for hours on end.  Calling it Early Access may do the game an injustice; it is better polished than many full release games.  The style and atmosphere are akin to Mount and Blade in turn-based form, and sees you marching across the procedurally generated map taking on mercenary contracts for various towns and factions.  The combat is sharp, and will require forethought more than brute-force.  The contracts are a bit repetitive, but the combat is enjoyable enough to overcome the repetive nature of your missions.  Most heartening, the repetive nature of your contracts appears to be a product of the early release rather than an inherent game flaw, and the game's current development course should see enough new content added before full release to fix what is my only (minor) complaint.

18,23870641,english,"Battle Brothers is a tactical RPG set in a world with a unique blend of low fantasy and middle ages themes. Overall I've quite enjoyed my time spent with the game and fully intend to spend much more time as it moves through EA and into full release. I think, for an EA game, there is a lot of content to be consumed and whilst some of it is a bit repetative, the pacing of the game makes for ever more things to do as my 15 hours has barely seen me through a couple months of gametime and each new campaign will give a slightly different experience as everything from the world to the quests is procedurally generated. 

So what do I like about the game?

* Overall a very rewarding battle system. Death is permanent, so the weight of your actions and the flow of the battle are very important. Losing a well leveled and armed member of your party can be devasting, which adds a sense of tension to every attack. 

* Sand-box Lite. The game, short of your first couple quests, basically gives you free reign over an entirely procedurally generated world that feels very *real,* which given the simplicity of the game is quite an accomplishment. Pretty much from the get go you can travel anywhere, work for anyone who pays, and explore a vast world with some very dangerous nooks and crannies. 

* Artwork: At first I wasn't sold on the battle portraits (felt wierd being only torsos), but after awhile it has grown on me. The character portraits are incredibly detailed as with all the armor, weapons, and towns. On top of that, the artists have done a fantastic job of capturing a sort of middle ages 'simple bumpkin' look that adds a sense of realism to setting. Additionally, the world map is actually rather beautiful and the way everything links together via roads, towns & hamlets forests, mountains, swamps, etc is done quite nicely -- Especially when you consider everything was procedurally built. 

* Progression: The progression of the game feels very rewarding and is paced very well. You have to really work for your pay and it's difficult to amass any amount of fortune as money earned disppears in a flash when you're buying provisions, medical supplies, tools, and whatever shiny new piece of armor happens across your way. Raw recruits start out as nothing short of cannon fodder, but those that you push through the first early levels become forces to be reckoned with, giving a nice sense of accomplishment for forging a simple farmhand picked up in a backwater town into a mercenary of death. 

* Writing: I feel I would be remiss to not mention just how obviously great the writing is. There is a lot of text in the game, from the various events to the blurbs before contracts, but all of it has an incredible tone that absolutely makes the environment and feel of the game. I went to their webpage to specifically find out who the writer was and give them a special shout-out. Casey -- awesome job. 

While I definitely recommend the game to anyone looking for a decent tactical RPG set with a particularly grim tone, there is definitely a lot of areas I think the game could see some improvement. It is still in EA, so it's possible that these will be fully fleshed out at a later date, but as of right now it feels as though some of the design elements are clunky or feel tacked on. 

What needs fixing?

* Travel: Travel right now is just supremely weird in general. Speed through rough terrain should be bumped up a little, as travelling through mountains or forests is agonizingly slow, but the worst offender I feel is your character randomly travelling across ocean / rivers where BOATS are sailing. It might take some tweeks to the world gen, but I really feel like there needs to be some collision detection preventing your character from walking through water. The ability to do this also completely underscores the use of harbors to travel from port to port. 

* UI: There was a pretty major UI patch that just went into Beta and it fixes a lot of problems, but there are still some quirks that could use ironing out. For starters the UI doesn't update if you have your mouse hovering over an icon for more information, which is quite annoying when waiting for your troops to heal or weapons/ armor to be repaired. 

So far those are really the only two major grievances I have with the game in terms of 'what isn't working as it should.' Beyond that though the game has many mechanics that are great foundations for further expanding. I know everybody hates an 'armchair' dev, but the game just has so many great foundations that it would be a shame if they weren't built upon as I feel that fully building upon the systems the devs have in place will be the difference between a 'good' game and a 'great' game. 

* Camping: Right now encampment feels very strange and could occupy a much larger aspect of the game. It seems as though the only purpose of camping is basically to speed up time, which you really only need when waiting for your troops to heal or your weapons / armor to be repaired. IMO camping could / should occupy a much larger aspect of the game and marching for long periods without resting should have some negative affects on your character's fatique. Make camping have a separate screen (much like a city screen) where you can tend to the needs of your men / your band overall. This would go great with the more complex injury system you are planning on implementing in the future IE, a place where you can manage and interact with your soldiers, pulling some off the front lines and manually assigning medical supplies to their ailments. This also gives you the ability to add in certain new mechanics for your mercenary bands, things like adding Followers that give special bonuses. Like a smithy that repairs weapons faster/ more efficiently . Maybe a nurse who decreases heal time or cost (or prevents illness). While it would certainly add a lot to the 'to do' list before release, I feel like the game needs more to the ""hook"" mechanic of managing your own band of mercanaries as right now the only thing to do is A) Hire / Equip soldiers or B) acquire money via contracts, when there should be a more personal and hands on system in place. 

* Taking over Settlements: Okay, so this may be totally out of line for the scope the devs want and also may be a little cliche, but I can't help but feel that as a I'm playing and coming across old abandoned forts or unaffiliated settlements how cool it would be to take them over or be able to carve out your own realm. Aligned with this, part of me feels the game lacks a certain direction other than acquiring money to acquire men and equipment so you can take bigger contracts to then just acquire more money. Having a sort of ""end game"" where you could perhaps pledge protection or assimilate the unafilliated settlements as your own -- Or even find your own abandoned ""plots"" beyond the fog of war and settle them with peasants and soldiers; Eventually building your own armories, weaponsmiths, keeps, and watch towers. 

Overall though, this game is a lot of fun and I am only so critical of it because I want to see it become a truly special and amazing game. It will be interesting to see how the game changes and improves over the course of the Early Access.",1467054391,1467066145,True,26,0,0.681196630001068115,3,True,False,True,76561198030706547,260,17,47940,605,1501,1600986786,,

The gameplay is pretty intuitive, and did not take too terribly long to gain a pretty solid understand about the perks for units, food, ammunition, movements and so on. The ""story"" is very reminiscent of the  Mount and Blade series, and by that I mean you basically are creating your own as you play and do contracts for royal houses or independent towns and cities. The characters you hire have their own stories as well, and each character has different skills based on occupation/background prior to hiring. Random events can also occur involving the men you have hired, which can be pretty entertaining. The art in the game is well done, the map is colorful, and there are plenty of types of enemies(bandits, orcs, goblins, undead etc...) to come across, too. The only thing I wish were different (which may change with updates or the full release) is the size of the map. It's certainly not small, but it could be a lot bigger. There could be more villages, towns, and cities. Having different ethnic groups would also be cool for immersion in different regions within the map. Another addition to the game would be having the royal houses/families going to war with one another, and perhaps even taking your soldiers into larger combat situations as mercenaries for one of the families.

The main focus is combat, and is based on a deep system where choices have more value than luck. If you enjoy strategy games and tactical combat (think X-COM) then you should probabily get this.

Pros:
- Great tactical combat.
- Lot of character and gear customization.
- Polished and bug free.
- Dificult settings for those that want a challenge.
- Great and simple artwork.
- Low specs needed (good for notebooks).
- Steady and great updates.
- Great writing in encounters and quests.

Cons:
- Lack of overall story or major objectives.
- Lack of endgame gameplay and no way to finish it.
- Limited quests and way to interact with the world.
- Lack of lore and world building.
- Limited music and sound effects.

31,23427901,english,"Battle Brothers is an open world sandbox RPG/strategy mix in a low-fantasy medieval setting.  It's basically Mount&Blade, except that all battles are turn-based.

What makes it special is the unique atmosphere of the procedurally generated game world. The dialogue texts let you catch a glimpse of a grim, heartless world (like in Game of Thrones) inhabited by a bunch of cynics, but the cartoon-like art style and the occasional dose of humour prevent it from becoming just another game with an overly dark setting. 
Gameplaywise, the sandbox doesn't feel complete yet as the game is still in its early access phase. The player spends most of the time travelling from settlement to settlement to gain money by fulfilling contracts, most of which require going somewhere and defeating some enemies in a turn-based tactical battle with your mercenary company. This is just as unspectacular as it sounds, but I still recommend BattleBrothers because I see great potential in this game: With some more features to make the game world more alive (Rivaling factions! Dynamic economy!), this might become a marvellously immersive sandbox game - and yes, the devs release update at a decent speed.

Initially I pointed out the similarity to Mount&Blade, and I think this analogy fits rather well because both games have something else in common: You might find flaws in it, the gameplay may be grindy and occasionally frustratig, but nonetheless I have to force myself to stop playing because it's so motivating.

You take on the role as a leader of a mercenary group of up to 12 sellswords which you hire from various towns and villages along the way. Taking on everyone from fishermen, daytalers, caravan guards, messengers, deserters etc. you then equip them before sending them to their turn-based tactical combat doom...

You can expect to lose people regularly much like the original Xcom, especially during the early game where the heavy armour is so far out of your price range.

The battle mechanics are fairly simple, hexagon tiles and turn order fighting.  The way armor works is very cool and original.

-Lots of customization in terms of gear. Shields come in all shapes with different protection from ranged and mele attacks. And they have a ton of different symbols and colors on the shield that add individual flavor to each shield.
-Large variety of weapons. Everything from pitchforks to flails, maces, swords, axes, hatchets, crossbows, bows etc.
-Lots of armor. All sorts of helmets and armors, scale armor, hide armor, chainmail, you name it!
-Interesting mercenaries with nice backstories.
-Nice leveling system where you get to manage skills and perks/special abilities.
-Pathfinding is great except for when crossing rivers, you wont have to click a bunch of times to get where you want.
-Combat is fun and has plenty of tactic to it.

The bad
-Early game, at least to me, was very brutal. In the span of about 1 and a half hour I had already died like 7 times, thrice on hard and four times on medium. I had to turn down the difficulty to easy and even then my party failed. I've had other friends share similar stories.
-Lack of variety in enemies. There's orcs, There's skeletons, There's bandits, wolves and wraiths. And that's pretty much it as far as I can see. I only have 10 hours on the game but I've roamed for a long while across the entire map and these are all the enemies I have encountered. There could be a lot more enemies coming but I've already grown extremely bored of the current enemies.
-Small map. Although the map seems large, there are very few locations. I've already been to every city and every castle/outpost multiple times and there's never anything new or interesting. Some more locations and maybe some more things to do inside the city would be fun.
-Fleeing archers. When you've cleared out their mele soldier and prepare to engage the archers, you will find that you will be spending 5-10 minutes moving all your troops trying to catch up with the continually fleeing archers that waste your goddamn time. Fix this.

It's been fun for about 10 hours but now things are beginning to become boring, there's nothing to do. Battling the same skeletons or bandits at this rate is just getting boring, there's no new enemies or unique quests that keep the game interesting. It becomes a grind is what I'm trying to say, it doesn't feel as if you are achieving anything. My gear is almost maxed and my guys are high leveled, I got 8000 gold but nothing to spend it on. I cant build a castle, I cant pick a fight with outposts, I cant raid villages or caravans. There quickly becomes a shortage of things to do, and that's my problem with this game. As it stands right now, I cant really recommend this game. It's not really bad, it was good for a 10 hours, but I expected much more from a game like this.

Battle brothers is a tactical turn-based combat RPG game which you control a band of sellsword(up to 12 char). For me the game is all about freedom/open world because you can go where and whenever you want, which job to take or decline is totally up to you. Even when you decided to take a job and then find it too difficult or you don't feel like doing it, you can cancel it anytime you want.

Mercenary jobs in this game are varied and diversified such as killing bad guys, bandits, monsters that troubled the locals (yes, there are lots monsters e.g. goblin, direwolf, werewolf,  orc, ghost and plenty more!) also guarding/escort caravans, delivering package, patroling streets, collecting heads for gold and more. Besieds, there are also politics and stories which is in development since the game is still in early access.

Items in the game are also varied. Usually in most games the armor that has 2 DR would be all the same look and name, in Battle Brothers they have different looks and  names eventhough they have the exact same stats. This attention to detail makes the game fashionable!

The RPG element is quite basic. You kill the enemies for exp to level up and you get to upgrade your character's stats, perks and stuff but when one or more of your character is gone, they're gone for goods! so be careful in battles, it's harsh and unforgiving

The last thing to mention is that almost everything in the game is random including events, world map, AI, your starting characters(names, looks, stats) places and stuff. So the game has a very high replay ability. Everytime you start a new game, it's never gonna be the same!

First things first, it's gorgeous. The characters look fantastic, as does the equipment. It makes the world a joy to play in, and the art does a great job of roping you into the experience.

The combat is excellent. There's a wide variety of weapons, all with different advantages and disadvantages.; The hex grid turn-based combat is hardly revolutionary, but it's a well done rendition. It allows for tons of differnt strategies to be used. Wanna form a shieldwall of spearmen while you send your axe-wielding barbarians right into the fray? Wanna use one tank of a man to keep every enemy occupied while you use the rest of your men to pick them off one by one? Wanna use an elite core of archers to keep the enemy at a distance while your spearmen protect them? There's just so much possibility. There's a perfect amount of attributes, such as morale and fatigue, that add extra depth to the combat and force you to manage your use of your men even more. The combat is brutal and unforgiving, but fair. The AI will take advantage of any mistakes you make, and will pick apart your defenses and make your seemigly unbeatable battle plans look foolish. They are just challenging enough to be fun and not hard enough to be frustrating. There's also a huge variety of environments, such as swamps and snow, to add an extra factor to your battles.

A big part of this game is your party of mercs itself. Every man you can get in the game is unique in their own way. They have their own appearances, as well as randomly generated backgrounds that explain what led them to come look for work as a mercenary. These backstories result in different buffs and debuffs to certain characters. For example, a hedge knight will be better in combat than, say, a former slave, but the former slave may have higher health due to having been hardended over his years as a slave. Permadeath is a huge part of this game. As your party grows bigger and stronger, you will become attached to your men. They will have gone through so many dangerous battles under your command. That's why it's so sad every time a bandit or werewolf carves their head clean off.
The worldmap is awesome. Every game presents a new, unique, randomly generated world for your motley crew to explore. This includes plenty of different towns and fortresses, as well as caves and bandit hideouts for you to attack. There's a wide variety of factins (also random) in every world, that have their own memebers. These factions have their own armies and towns, and getting on their good side is usually a good idea. There are also evil factions of orcs and goblins that will fcuk your shit up if you wander to far into the forest unprepared. There's plenty to keep you occupied in the world around you. When you're not slaughtering baddies and escorting caravans, you can get wasted at a tavern or talk with the townspeople. You can even give your guys a full makeover at the barber.

Overall, this game is a goddamn masterpiece. It's wonderfully constructed by passionate devs. Even though the game is practically done enough for a full release, the devs are constantly adding more content and have no plans to stop any time soon.

57,22446103,english,"So I wrote a really long, and in-depth review that for one reason or another didn't get posted.  So here's the long and short of it:

Good game, needs work, fuck you RGNesus!

The whole chess piece aesthetic to the characters SERIOUSLY put me off to this title for a long time.  And it got some pretty harsh reviews a few months ago so I stayed away.  And then it got some polish, and some people posted more/updated reviews, and so I took another look.  And I still stayed away.

Now I'm not saying the game is much better than it was when people were complaining about this game.  It's still bad in the aspects it's bad in.  Namely the RNG.  It's SO RNG focused that I actually get irritated by it.  I always look at RNG reliance as a bad concept.  But it's still EA, so I'll wait til the final release for a real verdict on that part.

The core concept is good, though I feel like 12 guys is NOT a mercenary company, it's an adventuring band.  And that's fine, the gameplay isn't ruined by that.  In fact the gameplay is pretty outstanding, EXCEPT for, you guessed it, the RNG.  Which I'll come back to.  But you get up to 12 guys, and I understand more than that slows things down and gets too big, so from a balance/gameplay/time factor I'm not complaining.  But that's... not a mercenary company and that's a bit of a let down.

The combat is good and balanced and well thoughtout.  Melee and ranged weapons, no magic, and while it COULD fit, would mess with the balance and other things, so it not being a part of combat (it's only in the game in a very slight way, undead) doesn't really make you feel like you're missing anything.  Although I will say that not being able to heal units in combat in a perma-death game is  HUGE problem IMO.  Weapons and armor have different types, strengths, weaknesses, and you can make any guy fill any role with MANY different loadouts.  Obviously min/max'ing is possible, and there are lots of discussions on the most powerful builds, but there's not a whole lot you can't do, and it's completely plausible to make a LOT of things work together.

But here's the reason I can't recommend this game.  That's right, I said I CANNOT recommend this game.  Weird, right?  I haven't talked about anything that's a deal-breaker.  In fact, I've actually complimented the game on basically every aspect of it, right?  Except the RNG is ATROCIOUS.  It determines EVERYTHING.  That contract in town? RNG.  That attack you're trying to make? RNG.  Seriously, it's just too reliant on that, and even putting that aside, it's HORRIBLY SKEWED.  When I miss 5-7 40-70% rolls in a row... in the 7th fight... of my 3rd playthru because I've been either killed or just so wrecked that I started over... yeah, that's bad RNG.  I'm not talking about X-Com missing that 99% that got half your squad killed.  I mean whiff fests like you would not BELIEVE against enemies who seem to be able to land every blow, and just ripping through your band of hardened mercenaries like wet tissue paper.  

And the way the game gives you quests is all RNG based too.  That 1 skull contract you take to deliver goods to a town because your guys are too bandged up to take part in another fight, but you need cash or everyone will leave?  Guess what, RNG puts it way on the OTHER side of the map.  So by making the trip, YOU LOSE MONEY!  And you lose rep for cancelling contracts (which I get), so better save in one of those slots before you accept one.

And some units need some SERIOUS rebalancing.  Orcs are WAY too strong.  Especially warriors.  The RNG aspects of combat coupled with unbalanced enemies seriously makes tactics totally obsolete.  There's no point.  The game just throws a wrench into your well-concocted battle plan every time.  And if this was done with good AI countering your strategy, I'd be THRILLED, but it's just RNG going ""Nope, you're gonna miss those 4 attacks against this one dude who's pretty much dead, but he's gonna toss aside you're walking tower of steel to punch your archer in the face because you're doing too well in this fight right now.""  Over and over and FUCKING OVER again.  I welcome a challenge, but the abuse this RNG throws at you is just ridiculous.

So here's the disclaimer to all this:  This game is good, from the core concepts to the details of every system, which I won't detail myself here.  But they're smart, they're intuitive, and they're easy to understand with very MINIMAL tutorial or explanation (the game doesn't really tell you much at all, and yet you're never really left scratching your head at how anything works, so MAJOR kudos there).  I've clearly spent a LOT of time playing it, so at it's very core, this game is not only good, it's fun.  And while the start is seriously brutal beyond belief, to the point where even X-Com is gritting it's teeth and telling it to lighten up a little, it's never insurmountable (except when RNG fucks you over for the 10th time against those god damn orcs again!).  But once the ball is rolling, you've got some good gear, some major badasses, and what amounts to decent tactics as much as an RNG base allows, it gets fun.

Also, RNGesus hates me.  Seriously, like with a fiery passion, the likes of which put Hell to shame.  So it really could just be that my luck is THAT bad, and I would NOT refute that arguement in the slightest.  But I stand by the statement that this game relies too much on RNG.

66,22337898,english,"Battle Brothers certainly is an epic game and being still in Early Access, that is very impressive. Here is my evaluation of the game, along with some suggestions for future content:

Pros:
+ Well-balanced perk system and lots of build choices. 
+ Diverse range of gear to use. 
+ combat morale system makes sense most of the time. 
+ Diverse range of opponents and very good AI. 
+ Great storylines and random events.
+ Scenarios.
+ naming your crew and company of course. 

Neutral:
= RNG in this game: Great when you get a critical ranged hit against an enemy before they fight because they didn't wear a helmet. Terrible when you swing for a melee hit with a 75% chance and still miss.
= I guess I understand this, but AI units on the map move like 15% faster than you so you either can never quite catch up unless they change course a bit or head into a swamp or mountain, or the enemy pretty much always catches you. I guess if this wasn't in the game, it would be too easy to move around especially if you got good reflexes. 

Cons:
- Fleeing brothers deliberately flee towards the enemy and get chopped to bits, even when they have a clear avenue to escape. 
- Dog AI sometimes a bit derpy when they run into an enemy zone of control and then try to move to another tile within enemy ZoC with risk of dying from free hit. 
- Arguably, a rather limited range of strategies when dealing with orc warriors and warlords. I personally think the orc warriors have too much fatigue points. 
- difficulty levels in missions sometimes misleading, usually underestimating the difficulty of a mission by 1 skull. 


Suggestions for future content:
> Higher max level + a new perk category tailored to the former professions of your brothers (e.g. hunters, bowyers, butchers, fishermen, raiders, etc.). Each profession would have its own perk system and each brother can only have access to the category allocated by their profession. Not sure whether there should be a beggar category. 
> More perks in each existing category and maybe shifting some of the tier 2 utility categories into the other perk categories, like weaponmaster going to attack and brawny going to defence. I think utility should be more neutral in having skills that benefit both attack and defence, not just one or the other. 
> More storyline missions for later in game, where maybe a war breaks out and one of the Houses requests you to join them in some massive battle aginst either some other House or against the orcs or goblins. 
> The Houses expand their Empire by capturing neutral settlements and subjecting them under their control. Along with that, there could be rebellions you could receive a mission to either help with the expansion or rebellion. 
> An Elvish race, a neutral, sometimes hostile, but highly territorial race specializing in high quality units but fewer numbers. They usually situate themselves in forests. 
> A Dwarf race, also neutral, sometimes hostile, but highly territorial race specializing in a weird mix between what orcs and goblins specialize in. They usually situate themselves on mountains. 
> other roaming mercenary bands, which may either be neutral or hostile. You generally need to keep tabs on them because they'll compete with you for contracts and/or any available contracts would offer less. They may be situations where you'll have to go into some reverse auction with another mercenary band just to get the job (e.g mercenary group who demands the least amount of pay gets the job). 
> maybe some rough terrain for battles in mountains. 
> private merchant missions, some of which may offer you a huge list of supply and demand for certain resources so you don't have to do so much guess work to figure out where you can make a profit using highly priced resources. 
> being able to change emblems on your shield to fit with your actual company emblem. 
> some way to see enemy buffs and what they do. 

Overall, there is so much potential with the game. I look forward to seeing more updates and for those interested in Battle Brothers, it's well worth the money to try this game.

Honestly though, the game gets repetitive and slogs down as you get further along (not hardware wise, gameplay wise).

70,22296768,english,"Hard to believe this is still an Early Access game. The basics:

You are a mercenary captain in a low-fantasy world. You yourself don't get involved in the fighting. You start out with three mercenaries and some gold crowns, some food, some medicinal supplies and some tools.

You travel from place to place on a strategic map that is procedurally generated. You look for work from nobles or from the elders of each settlement, or if you like, indulge in more criminal acts such as robbing trade caravans or peasants.

Your goal in essence is to survive, nothing more, nothing less. The world is unforgiving. Battles, especially early battles, can be brutal and death comes with shocking abruptness.

You salvage what you can from your defeated enemies' corpses and move on. Early in one game, I found myself overjoyed at finding a patched mail shirt pulled from the bloodied body of a bandit. Metal armour, yes! No glorious warhammers of +5 Mary-Sue-age here.

It is this that is the core gameplay. You are running a mercenary company, and just enough of that task is abstracted, presented by a UI that makes extensive and thoughtful use of tooltips, that it never feels like a spreadsheet simulator, yet also doesn't feel like a grotesque oversimplification.

You have to make sure you have enough food (which spoils), enough crowns to pay your men, enough medicinal supplies to treat them and enough tools to repair and maintain their gear. The nice thing is that you don't have to micromanage any of this - if you have the relevant supplies, your men just use them, but it takes time to make repairs or heal.

At the settlements, you can hire new people with different backgrounds to join your company, give them some equipment and hope they make it through the next few skirmishes. I've found myself hiring an ex-militiaman simply because he had a passable sword and I didn't have any spare. I've even hired a beggar because he was willing to join for next to nothing. I was desperately short of crowns but I needed an extra man in the battle line. I left him in his sackcloth clothes and gave him a wooden club. He died horribly in the very first fight. The game does a great job of incentivising the kind of ruthless desperation of getting by as a mercenary leader.

The movement on the strategic map is simple. It's in real-time but is pausable. You simply click where you want to go and your company starts moving there by the quickest route, using roads where possible. It's very similar to Mount & Blade's strategic map. You find contracts at settlements, but you can meet any number of things on the roads, such as peasants, supply caravans, bandits, orcs, goblins, werewolves... sometimes even undead. Go off the roads and you can discover abandoned ruins, concealed camps, lairs. You can play without taking a single mercenary contract, by just simply plundering such places, if you're able to kill or drive off their inhabitants. There is a day/night cycle that has real implications (sight range is much less during night time, you move slower, and certain... things... come out at night).

Random events can happen while you are travelling, with dialogue choices for how to deal with them. These are generated as well, but are usually contextual to where you are, or to certain traits your mercenaries might have.

The battles are turn-based on a hex grid, but the map is generated from the underlying terrain on the strategic map and the time of day. Height advantage, morale, initiative and fatigue are all pretty elegantly represented, and the equipment you have given your mercenaries makes a huge difference - different types of weapon have different attacks. Every battle feels like it has weight, because the consequences carry through onto the strategic map. If you only just win a battle, and your men are horribly wounded, you find yourself trying to find the nearest town to rest and heal - or do you set up camp out in the wilderness and hope your fire doesn't draw more trouble down on you when you're all hurt?

The art-style is 2D and deliberately stylised. There's no traditional animations, but every character is represented as a playing piece, from the waist up on a base. There's a lot of beautiful design choices here. If they're facing right, they're yours or on your side. If they're facing left, they're hostile. Attacks are clearly represented each time they happen, with clear visual feedback for the results - armour gets ripped up on the figure, helms get battered and the faces and bodies of the wounded get progressively more messed up. Blood sprays when health damage is done, leaving persistent spatters on the ground. Also, everything is represented - when someone dies, their body is left and you can pick up their surviving equipment mid-fight. When arrows miss, they stick in the ground and remain there for the rest of the battle. Shattered shields lie on the ground. By the end of a fight, the once pristine battlefield can look like a charnel-house yard.

The art in general is extremely beautiful, looking lovingly hand-painted. The overmap looks fantastic, with drifting clouds and flocks of birds. There are different colours for identical pieces of equipment which is a lovely touch.

Sound is similarly excellent, with pitch-perfect music to suit the mood, melancholy sometimes but with a strong medieval theme. The battle music is outstanding, keeping up a thread of tension and excitement without becoming overbearing and suited to the opponent (fighting undead is creepy). Each action is contextualised by sound too - each attack and the grunts or cries when they hit. I love the sound design on orcs and goblins. In the overmap there is ambient sound depending on the surrounding terrain, most especially in the settlements.

The sense of progression is the heart of it. Your men level up, and you can improve their skills and give them perks. Once you have a well-equipped band of hardbitten mercenaries (I love Deadly Slicers), you don't just get a sense of achievement, but of narrative too - and that's the greatest thing. Stories emerge naturally from the game, and eventually your mercenary company has a story you shaped from the start. The procedural element means every game tells a different story.

I also want to specifically single out the writing. The writing of everything, from tooltip descriptions, to random events to the dialogue when taking a contract, is exceptional. It isn't just good. It stays in context and always serves the atmosphere of the world. The writing is also beautiful simply as writing. It's genuinely outstanding and for me is a possible contender for the best in any videogame.

My only criticisms of the game are relatively minor. 

1. Currently, clicking around on the map to pursue another party can be fiddly - it would be nice if you could simply click on the party while paused and then your company simply pursues them along the currently quickest route without further intervention. 

2. When you mouse over a target in battle, you have to know the icons for the stances, for instance Riposte or Spearwall. Some text would be helpful.

3. The game needs female characters, as until then the world feels weirdly half-made. I absolutely agree with the devs' decision to make sure their backgrounds suit how a quasi-medieval world would treat them, so they want to put them in properly. I think they'll do a fantastic job - and I hope they add NPC's too - say a noblewoman who asks you to find her husband who has disappeared and now she's desperately trying to hold the lands in lieu of her husband against predatory rivals, or a lady or village elder in her own right.

However, the game is still early access and the devs have already stated they intend to implement number 3. So frankly, these minor quibbles are likely to be addressed.

84,22124410,english,"Holy shit! This game is awesome.

Therefore my first review.
Altough still in Early Access it allready has a detail, depth and replayability worthy of most full titles.
Developers name X-Com titles, Mount & Blade and Warhammer games as References.
Updates happen every couple of days and improve the allready pretty good game each time significantly. I honestly yearn for every new update with exitement and look forward to the new implemented changes and additions.


To pick up on the missing story critique 
This game creates its story out of itself. Its a sandbox game where story happens and develops out of random events and individual decisions. I can still remember how i hired my first Hedge Knigt nicknamed ""The Giant"". Could have upped armor for half of the company instead but i wanted to have him. Couple of days and fights later he's dead and the cash gone. This game is immersive as hell if you like this kind of games and don't miss a scripted story driven development. Still i see the point.

I have tried the normal and hard (one above) difficulty. With some experience in similar tabletop and pcgames normal difficulty is quite playable (from a certain point on possibly quite easy) but for novices to the genre probably demanding. Surely in parts because of a missing tutorial or handbook. On the next difficulty level things turned really demanding quickly and led to a more careful approch to missions and enemies. Fights had to be picked more carefully and Information about the enemy and adapting equipment became key. After the first hours played learning curve turned pretty steep supported by community guides. New combos and enlightening toughts shine on the horizon regularily.
Still developers tip: ""Prepare to loose soldiers"" ain't there for no reason.

As i have to come to an end, 2-3 Suggestions:

1) I just have to ask: Is there any chance to implement multiplayer in this game???
2) Permadeath is pretty hard an can lead to a save/load reactions, hampering the progress, for me its hard to cope loosing men so often. What about a death/injury handling as in Warhammers Tabletops Mordheim & Necromunda? It would add to character individualisation and binding. It would be an alternative to take the hardness out of permadeath (which still would be optional) Shadow of the horned rat is allready a reference :) It would also eventually allow for nonplayer bands to roam longer and built up a history of its own. 
3)  Getting out of close combat is pretty hard. Either get hit and stay or get away are two optional outcomes if you try to move out. Something like light hit and leave in between? Retreat out of a battle in total is rarely an option.


Minor personal remarks:
1) Terrain is sometimes hard to differentiate. Trees can be overseen if a character stands behind it. Different height levels sometimes hard to tell apart.
2) Possibility to customize setup at the start of battle is missing and hinders tactical preparation. But developers allready announced this feature. 
3) Contract types are few so far but more will be implemented over time.  

So far in over 70h played the game only stuck once when a special event on the world map overlapped with starting tactical combat and neither could be activated properly.",1459260721,1459260721,True,7,0,0.497057348489761353,0,True,False,True,76561197976209517,143,1,16406,0,6565,1583686465,,

-Overworld map / resource management / camping done well (vs sitting in a base between missions in most games)
-Not only nailed the standard turn-based combat system but actually improved on it
-Seriously, one of the best turn-based combat systems I've ever experienced. Deeper and less tedious than Baldur's Gate, Shadowrun, etc

-The game is actually difficult, whenever I start doing too well I get massacred by something new xD

-No support class, though there's a bunch of utility items

92,21821024,english,"This is one of my favourite ""type"" of games. I started playing it and quickly found so many irritants that I hope will be balanced better in the future that caused me to borderline regret the purchase here are some of them:

You spend from the early game on, all your time equipping low-level soldiers who when they die (and they usually do), you lose their gear and have to start over, with less cash.

You run into random encounters you have absolutely no hope of defeating, and when you run away, half your band dies and you have to get new guys, without the means to even recruit the basic dudes (up-front cost).

You make your way to a random town or city  to try and take on a quest only to find there is no quest, then run out of food or money and your dudes desert.

The battle mechanics are no different in the different difficulty levels, so your dudes will die.

No matter how good your dude's gear is, a lucky arrow or a lucky head-chop can kill instantly. Did I mention you lose the expensive gear too?

This is bad for story development. You want to have at least a chance of keeping your initial duo alive for the majority by being strategic or at lest keep them alive for a while.

My suggestions: all Battle Brother's equipped gear should be recoverable when a member of the team dies.
Map monsters levels should be proportionate to the area's on the map (not necessarilly the number of enemies, but at least how hard they are). For example. Don't have Orc riders who will almost kill your day three characters in one swipe, and if by chance you kill one of their direwolves, the orcs get back up and keep going. This is in areas where you first start off playing. That doesn't make sense.

Also, early on, there's nothing to indicate that you CAN swap weapons, or add extra ammo to your archers for instance. I suggest adding a ""swap weapon"" tutorial or button to make it more evident.

Give the players a chance to get to ""difficult"" areas before encountering suicidal missions. In the early game, it's hard enough to have enough money just to keep stocked up on food and medical supplies. Does the food really need to rot so damn fast? Granted real food rots, keep in mind this is a game which should be for the purpose of enjoying the challenge of the battles, the strategies, the alliances, or betrayals. Focus on storyline. Not brutalising the player.

A bunch of armless and legless bobble-head looking characters? Early access? Well why not, it's only $20 and I love tactics style games - maybe it'll entertain me a couple hours...

About a week later and I'm thoroughly addicted to this absolute GEM of a title. Yes, the little armless and legless midgets are a little cartoony at first but in no time at all you don't even notice it anymore. The gameplay is awesome, it's everything I love about a tactics game. The core premise kinda reminds me of the game ""Gladius"" where you run a mercenary company (instead of a gladiator school) and recruit and equip your team to fulfill contracts. There isn't a storyline as of this review, but the events are pretty well-written and give it an RPG element. It's a low fantasy setting, so don't expect any wizards or fireballs flying around. I actually really love the setting and the atmosphere; the names of all the characters are Middle High German which gives it a historical medieval feel, and the weapons and armor are very true to that setting. My only gripe about this game (and it's purely a vanity feature) is the lack of a memorial for all your fallen troops, although I understand this will be included in the final release. It is definitely a REQUIREMENT, because you actually really get attached to your little torso troopers. The game can be very unforgiving, and a couple well-placed crossbow bolts can kill your favorite guy in the blink of an eye (you will be missed, dear Theodebald).

While it is early access I honestly feel they've pretty much got the majority of the game mechanics finished, and just need to add a few polishes and features. This is the best $20 I've spent on a game in years. If you enjoy sandbox tactics games, this was made just for you.

In Battle Brothers you form and control your own ragtag mercenary outfit as your travel the land taking contracts to slay Bandits and Orcs, guard caravans, or anything else where you can exchange sword for coin. It's actually an incredibly cool concept that is well executed and manages to hit every note for me while feeling like you're actually managing a real mercenary outfit without too much excessive micromanaging. You will recruit farmers and fishermen alongside ex-soldiers and former bandits and can outfit them to your choice, you can give them spears and shields or axes and flails if you like, and you can take the contracts you want and discard the ones you don’t like. It's all very hands on and good at making the player feel like they're actively involved in the strategy instead of just 'go here and kill these guys and try not to get killed yourself'.


My only complaint is that Combat and the games finer points aren't really explained that well and the player is pretty much forced to figure it out for themselves and the current lack of content. However this game is still in early access with more content on the way.

         This game is a wonderfully implemented RPG/open-world type.The soundtrack is amazing and drags you into the beautifully designed atmospheric medieval world and lets you create your own story with your brothers.Every character has his own story which leads you to quickly form bonds with them,and to act cautiously in the battle phase,cus when you lose a brother you really feel upset.The battle is a very serious business in this game,it's highly detailed and you need to play systematically,shouldn't risk ending the turn without a defensive stance,like shieldwalls...Your men need to eat,repair their weapons,cure their wounds and be paid daily.You can't just stock tons of food in this game,cus every type of food has a spoil time.you need to buy tools to repair the weapons,ammunitions for arrows,medical supplies for wounds and earn money by trading or doing contracts with landholders.You also need to strenghten your men's spirits,they interact with you most of the time and your replys have consequences.The reputation of your band helps you get better contract payments and fair prices when trading in the towns.
         This game is solid and so much fun even in the early access phase.Showing so much potential.Don't hesitate and buy it.You wont regret.

To the developers;
        things need to be fixed:
- I can't catch the hints in the loading screens,maybe it's just my pc,not sure.Since there's no tutorial in the game i think i need those tips.
-When pushing back the enemy, i can't know where it's gonna be pushed.it changes.
-Sometimes the soundtrack changes in the middle of a song.
-There are performance issues.
        
       things need to be added:
-Bigger world map,more factions and interactions between these factions.This will make another story of its own and we would like to be a part of this partitioned world,we may take sides in this.
-Being able to have my own castle in the long run,have a say against the other factions,forming alliances with them or being at war.After all this,i wanna finally get more than just a reputation and a skilled and armed band of mercenaries.
-Being able to attack caravans or peasants,even other factions.I may have a bad reputation,this is also fun,another aspect of role playing.
-More than just contracts? more interactions with the landholders?
-Mounted soldiers.Ok we don't have machine guns as a support class but mounted soldiers were tactical units.
-The world map is nice,right,but it may be much nicer and more detailed.
-Quick Save??
-Much more perks,weapons and armor and abilities.
-Break down of the stats? Hover over will show you where did this much stat come from?
-maybe the stats of the enemy during combat? 
-this may seem unimportant; as i mentioned above that a death of a man affects the player which is great about this game,why not make your other men do a kind of burial ceremony, or have their say about the dead...?

*****I hope you will add much much more stuff than you mentioned under the title 'coming features.' Otherwise don't expect to have a bright future with this beautiful gem""""""""""

It looks simple enough to play but the combat is very nuanced and your decisions throughout battle carry weight since deaths are permanent.

No weapon or style is particularly dominating and the game challenges you to adapt to situations.

11,21890306,english,"Now this is how you make an Early Access game look promising.

I never buy EA games, ever. That's just a rule I have to prevent lazy developers from dropping their project all together and leaving me with an unfinished piece of trash. But with Battle Brothers it was different from the get-go. Something screamed ""genious"" at me. Basically, it was all the fact that the game reminded me of several successful and interesting games of similar genres: Warband, FF:Tactics, Tactics Ogre, Shadow of the Horned Rat and many dungeon crawlers.

 The game has an open world with non lineal quests that you complete only to improve your starting party and get more items to fit the style of fighting you want. This already allows for many types of party building, trying out new weapons, armor and whatever tools you can get your grabby hands on. The weapons have different abilities to reflect this variety in playstyle. Their use is very satisfying. Decapitating, impaling, stunning... All of these have their uses and add diversity to the combat. You can equip each character with whatever you think suits your warband best.
 Of course, your characters can also learn new abilities to improve their combat capabilities, like any good RPG. However, these skills do REALLY have a significant but not game-breaking impact. It reminds me of the table top verson of Mordheim, to be honest. Most importantly tho, the xp system rewards your guys for fighting, so of course you want to do that as much as possible. However that puts your mercenaries in a risk of dying, so you have to choose your engagements carefully. Luckly, the level ups feel rewarding after managing to survive with your fresh recruits for a while, so that's a huge plus. Increasing stats like melee skill or fatigue can really change the course of a battle later in the game.


The world map and quests are fairly simple and akin to those of Warband. You kill baddies, protect a caravan, deliver something and get gold in return. Pretty straightforward. You do get a bit of ""lore"" and backstory on certain events or characters, which adds to the fluff of the game. The most fun in the world map are the random events: certain characters may ask for more money, tell you something about their past, etc. You also have to make decisions, mostly revolved around morality, similar to how games like FTL do it. Something that is also really fun is the recruitment system. Every mercenary gets his piece of backstory and sometimes an alias to go with it. But most importantly, they have a defining trait, which is their profession. For example, a Raider may be more brave and skillful, but a farmer may be stronger and more durable. Hiring the right people is crucial if you want to survive late game... unless you enjoy cannon fodder being seint to the slaughter.

The combat tho, is where this game does it really well. However, it's also where the biggest flaws reside. Essentially, your band starts lined up if possible, facing the incoming force. You know the number of enemies you're facing when you enter combat but you may not have line of sight on them. Then the enemy either rushes or sits back depending on their race or party composition. The combat is responsive. Every hit feels right, breaking armor or making an enemy bleed. Also, you have to position yourself in a diferent way depending on who you're facing: too many throwing weapons? Advance your sword and board guys. Too many spears? Lob shit at them and shoot them. Depending on the map you may also have to reposition the soldiers that are left stranded so that they don't get overwhelmed early on. It rewards you for micromanaging your fatigue and armor too, so spamming attacks isn't necessarily a good idea all the time.

However, here's where the most glaring issues come into play, IMO. My biggest gripe is that a lot of the fights just end with your party clumped up fighting off the incoming horde of AI. There's not much tactical positioning when fighting in plains, as opossed to fighting in swamps or the forest. So, sometimes the difficulty comes from simply bad luck instead of strategic thinking. As stupid as this may sound, this could easily be fixed with something other games have, which is AOE attacks. If most battles reward you for sticking close together, then force even the most trivial of fights to become a hassle for the player. I think more diversity in terms of AI playmaking would be nice as well. 

With all that said, the game also has other pluses to add, mainly great and detailed art and a fenomenal soundtrack. My gratitude goes towards the composers, for creating such pleasant background music to listen to. 

So, all in all, I'd say this game is totally worth the current 20$ or € it costs. Do yourself a favour and buy it so it may grow further. Hoping to see more products from these guys in the future.

TL;DR Version: 

Pluses:

+Fun combat
+Good weapon variation
+Good character variaton
+Rewarding skill system
+Pretty art
+Great score

Cons:

-Overly simple quests
-Simplistic combat in certain scenarios
-Orcs (fuck these guys :( )

The artwork really is above and beyond a great majority of indie titles (particularly the detail - I was amazed that changing gear actually changes your appearance with artwork this good).

[i]Essentially, this is a Robin Hood simulator of sorts.[/i] You lead a band of 'brothers' or mercenaries across a beautiful landscape. You drum up money by buying-low and selling-high based on different town/village/city sizes. Its all fairly complex, with layers of learning as you go. The band consists of up to 12 men, all with their own level-ups and past histories (that determine fundamental buffs, etc.). You take on quests.

[i]The combat system really shines here, and is hella fun once you learn the ropes.[/i] I mean there is a [i]ton[/i] of strategy with how you equip your men, how you go about formations, and how you actually fight. The turn-based nature of the combat is super smooth and makes great use of intuitive keyboard and mouse controls.

+Probably one of the most active developement teams I've seen.
+The game is very polished as-is, and feels finished.
+Artwork is of some of the highest quality I've seen.

+Intuitive control system.
+Learning curve is steep enough to offer plenty of depth in the game, yet you can figure it out in probably 2-5 hours depending on you.
+Maps are randomly generated, although main quest line is the same every time.
+Its [i]fun[/i]!

-I would like to see a statistics screen in order to look at whole-clan profiles and statistics.

The game does a very good job of making you care about what happens both in combat and in the overworld, and the combat is challenging and tactically interesting. It also deals with aspects such as repairing equipment, feeding your mercenaries etc. in a way completing devoid of annoying micro management as well which is a refreshing change.

The only negative thing I can say about this game in its current state is a lack of ""end goal"" and so you just end up making your own end goals. The developers have said this will be introduced in time but I feel like it wouldn't be difficult to just introduce some placeholder ""big bad"" for you to gear up and work towards killing in the mean time. Could randomize the ""big bad"" for each play through as well. I feel like this would massively add to the already strong replay-ability of this game.

Don't let that put you off buying this however as it is one hell of a game, and as I said the developers have stated that they're working towards an end goal or ""quest line"".

44,21824686,english,"Fantastic Early Access game, two thumbs up. I never take the time to write reviews but i was compelled to do so for Battle Brothers. This game appealed to me because i loved Final Fantasy Tactics as a kid and have been disappointed time and time again by the genre since. I have Xcom Enemy Unknown (the first game), a game made by a major studio/publisher, yet I am drawn to this indie game more! It is kind of a toss up between this and darkest dungeon. This game has better mechanics but DD is just more polished with an amusing story.

The Good

-Text Based story is not overbearing but is still engaging, especially when your brothers come to conversate/offer advice. As the contract/faction system fills out this can only improve imho.

-The Characters, each brother you recruit will have different traits (think agents/generals in Rome Total War 2) it gives each of them pros/cons and a personality. For instance I have multiple characters with drinking perks that are either good or bad.

-You can rename any character and bestow him a title, which is both amusing and immersive. The barber shop lets you change their apperance to suit their new names. I love seeing my big fat Hodor chopping peoples heads off with his axe, or an ageless Brett Farve throwing javelins into my foes. 

-The economic decisions are both gratifying and fun. All trade goods have a ""worth"" and a price to buy or sell at that location. For instance I find an orcish axe that is worth 400 but the small fishing village has no use for such a thing only offers me 100 for it. I will probably take this axe with elsewhere and sell it at a better price. You must also provide food, tools, ammo and medical supplies for the company. 

-The combat is challenging with dire consequences. If you can't deal with the loss of a favorite brother and are not the kind of gamer who can load and try the fight again, definitely not the game for you.

The Bad

-The combat, it is really really hard. I picked up this game with my Final Fantasy Tactics swagger and tried to play on the 2nd difficulty ""challenging"" I was epically crushed by the first fight. The lowest difficulty is ""Even"" not easy and I think the suggestion of it being even is a cruel joke by the devs. 

-The combat animations are a little lack luster. I understand they are like game pieces and the legs won't move or anything but I think some opportunities were missed here. Some animations like a 2handed axe decapitation are spot on, others could just use a little more movement or even audio. 

-Everyone has a level, stats ect. However, you can't see the level of your enemies or the mission you are on. You basically go off the name from the scouting report if you get a scouting report that is. I know a bandit thug is weaker than a bandit raider but I dont know exactly how strong they are. It is all relative and has led to fights where I am at a disadvantage both level and gear-wise

-The leveling is compounded by there is no real easy way to level someone. I have 9 brothers that are levels 3 to 4, one dies. A new recruit is level 1 unless you spend 1000s of crowns on him. All of my recruits get slain the first fight and i don't get all of their gear back. Once someone has fallen off the leveling curve it is very hard to get back up. I am going to try putting the new guys as archers but then they may not be doing what they are good at, just hiding to try and get xp which is dictated off damage done. 

All in all I like it but buyer beware. One will either love it or be really frustrated.",1457907686,1457907686,True,10,0,0.580279827117919922,0,True,False,True,76561197963396459,188,2,3583,0,1314.0,1585809899,,

Ok so i have played alot more now (more than 7 hours anyway).

This game is good and is only going to get better. I'm really looking forward to if they bring in mod support as this has community input written all over it imo.

Brutal perma death is actually kinda a feature as it makes every swing in the game meaningful and nail biting.

They have mentioned doing a bit of work on the skill tree and id love to see more viriaty in terms of what skills and builds can be viable. eg one handed sword master type could use some love.

Overall pretty great and at least a great start. The world map update made a lot of difference in terms of play and replay ability.

-----------Old-------------

Brutal perma death. Don't get attached to your peeps. Also if you lose one battle it’s pretty much game over. Not heaps of variety in gear etc.

93,19987743,english,"Update ii: With the release of the world map/february 2016 update much of the imbalance in combat has been addressed. Even wages of individual soldiers (vetrans especially) seems improved. The overall game mow has greater content and variety. The world map is vibrant where before it seemed drab and empty and the game as a whole seems nearly fleshed out. Long term gameplay and goals are still vague/non-existant, but the game is as of yet unfinished. I would like to see more bandtry options for players. Cureently, stability is down a bit, but should be addressed in a upcomming update.

Update: I've played some more of BB, with different tactics. I have encountered some more issues--caravan guards runaway in battle if odds are against them. Sometimes they stand still. Other times they charge headlong at the enemey, leading to their quick destruction. It is disappointing when they stand still as their caravan/donkey is hacked to pieces. It would be nice if scouting/placement of units was done in a tactical and not random manner.

Please don't pay attention to my 'in-game hours'. I have upwards of 30 in this game. Moreover, I first tried BB when it first released to ealry access. I am, for the most part, pleased that the devs have consistantly added new features--game content seems to be coming along at a good pace. And, on occasion, BB is fun to play. The models (especially undead) are very well done. Characters look awesome, especially as things progress.

  Yes: this is in early access. Yet, the same issues that plagued early gamplay are still  prevelant, maybe worse. Billhooks and crossbows (if you find someone with any accuracy) are insanely overpowered. Same goes for any other melee weapos with 2+ range. More frustrating is the seemingly random criticals and insta death that occur on both sides during combat. This happens to both armored and unarmoned combatants, vetrans and fresh recruits. I find myself cocking my head in utter confusion when a new recruit suddenly beheads an undamaged assailant, covered in mail armor, or the opposite occurs to my merc captain with 55+ vitality remaining. Why does this happen so often? 

  Why is my teams ranged combat so inaccurate despite similair skill levels to melee? Shouldn't I hit something if I fire into a crowd of enemies for long enough? On the other hand, enemy marskmen will clean the floor with most of your team if you don't keep obstacles between you. Please consider shortening the movement potential of certain enemy units.
  Also, why do goblin riders get to move and attack 3 times (one wolf, two melee)? They're already dangerous with their ability to skirt your front line. Why can't mercanaries have similair skills to mobs (orks charge)? And why is this game still so dipleasing to play? I like rougelikes and perma death but there is little payoff to enduring a battle in which your team gets sudddenly halved. There is a lot of potnetial here.

You roam around a procedurally generated map adopting quests, random events and contracts as a means to feed, sate, equip, heal, repair and maintain your company of hired men.

Yes, you can make your party of friends and equip them to survive, only to be torn down by ghouls in six minutes.

Roaming the map feels a lot like Darklands. You go from village to village and encounter some kind of contract, alement or quest. Admittedly it's a thin herd of options right now but as early access trudges on, so does the feature list. Today they just added an entirely reworked world map, economy, and politics system -- and there's more to come.

Combat is turn based and tactical. It's simplistic and easy to be punished for and needs some balance tweaks, (RNG is very real for some weapons) but it gets better every update. Permadeath is a feature -- you can and will lose your company, either entirely or partially, almost every fight. One whirring arrow can catch your eye and that's that for your favorite level 4 merc.

Enemies include ferocious, unique Orcs. Terrifiyng undead/ghouls, and enemy mercs/bandits/robbers/militia that stand in your way. Fighting each 'faction' feels unique and punishing. Orcs will slaughter, take double turns, cut off your heads. Ghouls will rise back up RIGHT next to you and kill you. Humans use evasion, tactics and flanks.

14,20516865,english,"Great game, definitely recommended. However I am only writing this review because I don't know any other way to give feedback.

If I have any complaint about this awesome and promising looking game, it is goblins....

Goblins are way, way overpowered right now. Basically, whoever created these goblins envisions goblins as the ultimate guerilla super ninja... not really how goblins should be. Goblins have: extreme ranged attacks, extreme accuracy on all ranged and melee attacks, apparently insanely high critical chance on all attack, great melee and ranged defense, absolutely insane crowd control with constant mass root - almost every goblin troop type is capable of root and insanely accurate, insane crit chance ranged attacks, and an AI that only wants to kite the player. That level 5 mercenary in heavy chain that has beat down orc warriors will just be quickly cut to shreds by a couple goblin ambushers in 1 turn.

Really not fun, when I hit goblin missions, I just skip them altogether rather than spent 10 turns watching half my team die before I can even get into melee range.. and this with a group that can handle a couple dozen orc or human enemies. To deal with goblins the player must adopt an extreme and specialized suicide blitz strategy that is not effective and actually counter-productive against all other enemy types in the game. If these are the goblins, I don't understand why the game does not begin with goblins having completely enslaved the entire world.

Other than that, I am loving this game.",1452745296,1452745296,True,2,0,0.501667559146881104,2,True,False,True,76561198084679390,106,6,28740,0,7928,1585457192,,

Gameplay is a refreshing mix of a gritty, morally ambiguous open-world experience with methodical tactical combat ala classics like FFT. In a world filled with undead, orcs and more, you can expect that your mere human Brothers will die quickly, and often. Combat can be unforgiving, but gives you a real sense of reward when you manage to pull it off. XCOM fans will not be disappointed here.

Theme and art style are also well done. Brothers have this interesting chess piece-like feel to them (being represented by only disembodied torsos), but their randomly generated names, backgrounds and traits lend a surprising amount of character to each one. By the time your Brothers hack their way through a few battles, chances are that you'd have quite the soft spot for your mangy warband; with stories to tell your friends of the time ""Reinhold the Torturer"" made that sick Hail Mary arrow shot at max range or when ""Otto the Fisherman"" demolished 8 zombies all by himself.

Battle Brothers is a diamond in the rough. It's a game that has combined systems of others and has managed to create a fresh new gaming experience. 

You are the leader of a mercenary company. Your job is to simply do what mercenaries do best: take on dangerous jobs for sweet, sweet money. You'll face goblins, bandits, undead, and orcs. There are perils aplenty, and to combat such things, you have to create a team that can be versatile in all combat situations. This is where the game shines, in the freedom of creating a strategic team that can survive any situation.

You can buy gear, hire more mercenaries with unique traits, and devise tactics to overcome your foes. In combat, it all pays off. But beware, for the game is brutal and unforgiving. Such is the life of a mercenary, to live and die for glory and gold. 

The music is beautiful and crafted wonderfully, and the art-style of the game is charming and very fitting. What I love a LOT about the game are the small little descriptions of mercenaries you hire. They all have little backstories which helps me live inside this randomly generated fantasy world. I love it because I can create my own stories in the absense of a campaign. The writing is also simply superb and well-written.

23,20034736,english,"This game is still very early in its early access phase, but the core game loop that's there is enormously satisfying. Think Darklands + Mount & Blade with a very attractive graphical presentation. Hand drawn procedurally generated world maps, spiffy looking characters you can dress up with a huge variety of weapons and armour, and, of course, hats. Medieval German low-fantasy tactical hat simulator.

There is also RPG-style character progression for each of the 12 members of your mercenary company, complete with talent trees, making it all the more painful when your favourite guy's head gets chopped off by an orc cleaver. Brutal, brutal permadeath, but that's okay because there's any number of gravediggers, rat catchers, farmers, hedge knights, beggars, and all kinds of other adventurers waiting to be hired. Did I mention there's a whole pile of character backgrounds? Complete with various other traits that will give benefits or penalties in combat, the whole setup vaguely recalling the character traits from Crusader Kings. For example, Cowardly will mean that the character will never gain high morale in combat, while Loyal will mean that the character will be far less likely to desert your company should your funds or supplies run out, while a character with a Houndmaster background will gain bonuses when handling dogues. Loads and loads of others that will incline the character this way or that, and it's up to you to build them in a way that will take advantage of those traits.

While the strategic gameplay is great, where the game really shines is the excellent hex-grid turn-based tactical RPG combat. Here, think X-Com + Final Fantasy Tactics (or so I've been told, not being privileged to have played FFT). Lots of depth in setting up combos with the aforementioned weapon variety and RPG-style character builds. Bonuses for high ground, standing behind trees for defending against missile fire, and so on. Each type of weapon has its own unique active abilities. Here, think GW2 but greatly simplified since you're not controlling only the one character. So, for instance, a shield will give you a bash and a defensive shield wall ability, blunt weapons like maces will have a basic attack and a stun, a warhammer will have a basic attack and an armour-break, a sword will have a basic attack and a defensive riposte, and a greatsword will have various AoE abilities that chop bandits up real nice.

You will lose many men, thats for sure, but you ll enjoy the adventure. It is survival of the fittest(and sometimes the luckiest...) Random events contribute to the immersion, and give an old school text rpg flavour. The music is really good, creates this eerie medieval, rather than epic fantasy, music.

25,19939914,english,"Battle Brothers... what's that about?
So, what can you do in this game right now: 
1) Generate a world with different towns, villages, castles and etc 
2) Start off with a 3-men mercenary company and work your way up 
3) Earn money by completing different tasks: slaying, guarding caravans, defending villages against goblins, orks or werewolves. 
4) Spend money on mercs wages, new equipment, provisions, medicine, ammo and repair kits 
5) BATTLE. I must say, as a fan of turn-based tactics, I find the already implemented battle system in Battle Brothers very solid and fun. It's rather simple, but have it's ""depth"". Across the world of BB you will find a lot of nasty enemies: mentioned above werewolves, goblins, orks, also undead and other humans. They all got different tactics and gear and it's bringing more fun to the game. 
6) Art style & graphics. Well, it's 2D and when you play a 2D game and it's not a ""pixel throwback to 80s"" it's all about art style. And to my taste, the style here is absolutely stunning. The work the artist did on the tiles, characters ... basically everything is not only well done, but done really VERY GOOD. (but ofc there is a room for improvement here) 

Overall, these guys managed to create one of the best indies ever (also, one of the best EA titles), and it will become even more enjoyable in Februart 2016 with the big update coming, bringing new wordl map mechanics, fast travel, factions with their own politics and much more.

28,19863636,english,"Hire a small band of peasants to kill some bandits. Feel empowered at your early success. Make a few gold and build your team up. Things are looking good for you. GET UTTERLY CURB STOMPED BY ORCS, UNDEAD,  AND WEREWOLVES THE NEXT DAY.

You're going to die, best just to cry and let the impending sense of futility wash over you now before you even get started. It'll make things go by much easier.  

Much like Xcom and Dark Souls, you'll literally live or die based on the ability to learn and adapt to the threats presented to you. The difficult curve is practically at the ceiling starting out. There is no forgiveness for mistakes here. If you see a brigade of bandits coming your way, but better haul your *** in the opposite direction. Just because you managed to hire 3-4 peasants to aid you in your journey, doesn't mean there aren't far more experienced, well armed, and capable soldiers out there ready to slaughter you. For that I applaud Battle Brothers. I always hated unjustifable weak enemies in games being slowly spoon fed to you just so you could level up to take on the next bigger meal. 

Combat is much like any isometric turnbased strategy game. You move your units along hexes, the order of which being based on initiative, and then hack the opposing enemy to death. Units have different abilities based on the weapons and equipment they're carrying. For example, if you have a shield, you can bash enemies away from you, or create a one~multiple man shieldwall. Spears can be held outward, to counter any enemy that walks into range, axes can cut shields apart etc. There's a fairly good diversity of total moves, but each weapon generally only has 2-3. 

The main resource in combat is stamina. Everything your men carries causes them to effectively slow down and tire out more quickly. While a fully armored knight might be very hard to kill, they're very slow, and in only a few turns, will end up doubled over, out of breath. Pacing your men and having them slowly accilimate to heavier gear is a sound strategy, and while you may be lighter than your advesary, you'll be more nimble and can run circles around them. 

There are many tools at your disposal, and each has their own strengths and weaknesses. Clubs, spears, maces, axes, daggers, flails, billhooks, and bows and crossbows are just a few weapons of your arsenal. See a knight in practically impenetrable platemail? Bash his helmet in with a mace and hammer, or puncture it with a pick axe. Hell, use a dagger to seek the weakpoints in the joints of his armor and do pure damage. Are they in cloth or light armor? Run them through with a spear, cut them apart with a sword, or shoot them with an arrow. Having a wellbalanced team will lead to victory, as each opponent will carry a mix of different equipment. 

Armor and shields are likewise, very diverse. Everything from cloth, hauberks, and multi layered full on KNIGHT armor is present, each with their own stamina requirements. Armor be heavy, not to mention bloody expensive. Not to worry however, salvage is a fairly big part of the game, and you'll regularly find gear off the poor sods you murder, though it will often be in disrepair. Go figure, slicing a guy in half can leave you with a destroyed suit of armor. 

In terms of story, the game allows you to travel along a randomly generated map in any direction you choose. In towns you can purchase gear, hire new mercanaries, or take on missions. These missions however are fairly boring and practically boils down to find this, deliver that, destroy this camp, or escort a caravan.

Now the game is amazing, you start as a mercenary company with 3 companions, all 3 with their own background story and every new game you get 3 new companions with different background story's, same goes for the companions you hire in city's, each one has his own background story and they all have some unique traits, like: greedy, quick, drunkard, strong,... which makes your characters so much more real, and as you progress you get these unique things that can happen, like you meet someone who tries to steal from you but he looks like he hasn't ate for days, what do you do? and so it gives you choices. The battles itself are amazing aswell, you have to choose which weapons you use for which characters and it can make a difference between if you lose or win a battle.

With this, I also wish the player could be notified of the difficulty of the contract. (Many times I would pick a contract only to see the area I was to raze was rated as impossible.)
- The permanent death of soldiers is a neat take on it since you can easily replace brothers with cannon fodder or with higher quality troops. The only problem is that when your troops die you tend to lose their expensive armor and items. This was supposedly fixed as of 8 September 2015, but I haven’t noticed a difference after multiple character deaths.
- Choice is types of weaponry allow for strategic troop set ups. I like having a shield wall of spearman forming a spear wall. Really satisfying when the AI has no choice but charge the wall. I do wish some more weapons and armor choices were added.
-The only real problem I have with the how the game currently is has to do with how ranged combat takes place. The AI archer will nearly one hit kill my troops with about a 70% accuracy to hit. I find it really frustrating going into a battle with even one archer in the AI’s army. Basically means at least one of soldiers in full armor is going to die in the second round because the AI hardly misses. More than one and you are going to be stuck in a round of retreat and load the auto save and hope for crappy computer rolls until you can make it out with acceptable losses. I’m actually going to stop playing this game until this is fixed. Way too frustrating in its current state.
I do really enjoy this game and would like to continue playing and even donate to help see its completion because I just really enjoy this game. 10/10 would buy again. (Fix the freacking archery! It’s the real reason I’m even doing this review. Please somebody on the development team read this. I just couldn’t besmirch a good game without saying how much I enjoy it because it would give somebody the wrong impression.)

36,19545757,english,"Caveat emptor: Early access, so there is always the risk a future update ruins everything
This is already a very solid game. Even disregarding the promised updates for early 2016 (settlement upgrades, persistent great houses, reputation, contracts and backstabbing).

Name your band of merry mercenaries! Tour the randomly generated countryside! Lure farmers and fishermen to your banner with the promise of gold! Take on contracts to escort a caravan from a to b! Watch with horror as all your men get slaughtered by goblins!

The game has 2 parts, the results of which feed back into each other. Much like much-belowed UFO: Enemy unknown (X-COM in the states). The overmap where you wander around, take on contracts, upgrade and equip your band, and the hexagon map where you fight turn-based battles. The overmap is servicable, but barebones. (At least until the devs deliver the upgrades they promised for early 2016). But it nonetheless provides continuity between the battles.

Battles are where the meat of the game lies, and they are a joy to play. There's a decidedly board-gamey feel to the battles in the best possible way. Information is displayed concisely and you seldom feel overwhelmed or uncertain about what's going on. Positioning is the name of the game, making sure your people are placed so their gear works well against the enemies they're facing and that you can deal the maximum damage while receiving the minimum in return. The AI is quick to exploit holes in your formation, leaving to many a vader-esque ""NOOOOOO!"" as permadeath claims your favourite battle brother.

The main complaint I can raise is that there is currently no endgame. Canny players will eventually reach a point where they have a full band of high-level mercenaries with all the best equipment and nowhere to go from there. The developers are aware of this, hence the current work on the overmap to give the player an ""endgame"" objective to strive for.",1449490203,1449490203,True,4,0,0.54356849193572998,2,True,False,True,76561197969354918,511,18,9106,0,975,1597352924,,

38,17361473,english,"Great concept and well executed, delivers what it says it does.

This game is pretty difficult and hectic even on the easier modes, and there's a few features intentionally left out that make the game frustrating.  You can't have a base of operations and say, store recruits/veterans in a barracks.  One bad battle and your game is over, at least 75% of time.  The equipment management is sorta clunky, and the general way logistics are introduced in this game rubs me the wrong way.

Unfortunately, the game really enoucrages save scumming in it's current state and does not offer much of a strategic challenge (since the majority of the time you cannot choose who you're going to be ""hunting"" or who'll be available for recruiting).  Many of the mechanics of the game (such as following caravans, why is there no auto follow option?) are tedious and underwhelming.  Since I have been playing the Early Access, there's not a lot of content and the game gets boring fast.

The last problem is that not only have I iterated that many of the mechanics (strategics, skills, supplies, logistics, etc.) are tedious, but also not very well explained.  In fact, there are some mechanics introduced that are just plain wrong.  For instance, ""certain mercenaries prefer certain weapons.""  I have done some testing personally and looked at stats, but other than a range/melee focus characters do not have weapon preferences.  This game misinforms you, does not explain its mechanics well (perhaps in an attempt not to hold your hand, though to be fair I didn't have much trouble discovering things on my own), and gives you a sparse amount of resources that are generally insufficient.

Despite the fact that the game pretty much delivers what was advertised, I would not recommend it.  The fun it offers is mitigated by the tedium, though I will continue to test it out as updates come out.  The last thing I should mention is that the game is stable and in addtion I have yet to encounter any bugs, glitches, or crashes.

Alvar joined and together we traveled around the world.

42,19295758,english,"This is really a nice unique game. I was hesitant at first since one can never be too careful when it comes to early access. But I can honestly say that this game, even at this stage worths every cent.

It feels and plays like the turn based and low fantasy version of Mount&Blade so if you like that game there is a huge chance that you will also enjoy Battle Brothers.

It is challenging but easy to learn because of simple mechanics and clean user interface. Music is decent, sounds effects are enjoyable. Graphics and art style is really nice as you can see from the screenshots. There are lots of ways to customise your companions, with different kinds of helmets, weapons and armors. You can level up your battle brothers and choose different perks. Each battle brother has their own unique backgrounds like some are hedge knights, some are sellswords while some of them are just simple farmers. They also have unique perks like some of your companions may have deathwish (doesn't care about morale and will keep fighting) or some of them may be bloodthirsty (all his kills will be fatalities) so such small details make each battle brother unique and adds to atmosphere.

Game is very stable and bug free. New updates are looking great, especially the one with standart bearers and knights (with helmet decorations) , factions and royal houses to give a nice medieval atmosphere, devs keep polishing and making old content better. Updates are pretty frequent so I doubt this game will be one of those early acess games that will stay beta for several years and devs jumping on a new project.

So if you are interested with turn based games I am pretty sure you won't regret Battle Brothers.

Players must juggle the logistics of supplying, paying, and equipping their mercenaries with a white-knuckle battle system that will leave you in a state of catharsis nine times out of ten.

I will be frank here; Battle Brothers is unashamedly a brilliant game, one that is consistently evolving to become even more than the basic concept. Already, we have four graphically, tactically, and musically different enemy factions to fight against, with a fifth on the way. The world map is simple and perfectly functional at this time, with the upcoming release bringing with it a beautiful new map; one with regions, towns, cities, and noble houses ready to exploit.

It has strategical features, as well as explorative features. It is in a very early state, so there isn't very much to do (thus, The Elder Scrolls: Arena). Quests get repetitive and the Rogue-like aspects shortly wares off as your party grows in strength.

It is an Early Access title with immense potential, and thus, it deserves all support it can get.

- Caravan ""Follow Command"", during world map exploration.
- A NEO Scavenger or Project Zomboid Injury system, with added Armor system.
- Crusader Kings"" & ""Games of Thrones"" themed aspects. Factions, alignments, different seats and crowns and shield bands. Intrigues, start as a mercenary band, gain reputation, fame, become a regent, a king, a ruler and so on and forth.

I think i dont have to talk about what battle brothers really is, caus every gamer is able to watch the videos or read some stuff on the web to inform yourself about the game.

A second tactic I have tried and worked is Heavy armor with HEavy weapons spaced 1 hex apart, with bows/crossbows to the rear. This lets missiles have a good firing lane and heavy weapons use area attacks. At the last, each soldier has traits that can affect them some minor some major some affect battle some events. Always check what traits your soldiers have after aquiring them.

69,17938982,english,"Extremely user friendly, you can just hop right into a new campaign and pick it up as you go.

Combat is a lot of fun- watching the enemy crumble as you beat holes into their shield line is just so satisfying. Then they turn around and gank half your crew in one turn. So dealing with mass casualties is a strong possibility until you level your guys up and get all twelve slots on your team filled.

Some bits of combat are a little wonky- the camera level goes up and down depending on your characters' elevation. So if you spawn your guys across a hill side, figuring out where everyone is can be a bit of a headache. The layout is also kinda weird- you have to bounce in and out of several screens to see your fighters' gear, see what is available in the shop, and see their perks. Trying to equip and level up your crew can be a pain in the neck. Just minor things that don't break the experience, but hey, it's still early access, you take what you can get.

There's no plot, but the devs are apparently working on it- for now it's just wandering around a medieval Germanish landscape with beautiful graphics, spending your time killing, dying, and making money. Once the plot gets slipped in, I predict that this will be an instant classic of the genre.

What is the end game? I mean, We have to kill every thing? Is theare a main campaing?  Are we just trying to reach an amazing stash or something like that, before retiring ?

71,17897794,english,"Reading the reviews(what I usually do before buying a game), I saw that this game had the atmosphere and distinct characteristics I really enjoyed in prior games. Being a fan of games like Final Fantasy Tactics and Tactics Ogre, this hit a strand and stuck with me. 

The frustration when you have your combat line in formation, archers/crossbows in the back sniping enemies and your foes have one of your men pinned with many wounds and may die at the next hit. There are twice as many enemies on the map and you have only killed a handful. The line holds this mass of troops back but your one brother has been with you since the first day. Do you break the line to rescue the weakened brother but risk being overwhelmed and attacked on all fronts or do you want to take the risk of watching him dodge attack after attack and may see him fall one turn, never to rise again as that man you once fought with.

In the beginning it can be frustrating, not having the man power nor the equipment so you leave every battle with a loss or two. Later on, its even more frustrating when you have well armored troops who have fought and bled alongside one another for days fall to a chance arrow.

The game does have elements of fantasy, werewolves, goblics, orcs but they are each a separate force with different skills, tactics, and abilities. The human enemies are just as powerful against an underprepared company.

On top of this, weapons have wear which takes time to repair. Health can be healed but after a long period of rest. Plus you carry food and arrows that dwindle with time and  battle AND random occurrence. You need to pay your men(I think maybe they could change this part to once a week) and if there is not enough food/money they desert and leave. 

I like the realism, the feel of the game, how gritty it gets. Each battle has me on the edge of my seat because I honestly don't know how it can go. An ""easy"" battle may have one chance arrow that hits my best fighter in the face and I have to watch him die.

Of all the early access games I  have bought, this one is indeed worth the $20 price. It doesn't have half as much as I could want but at its current state, this game fulfills a need that isn't well addressed in many games today. I actually do feel like a commander of a fierce company which has to pick and choose battles due to realistic limitations.

Some good years back, i was amazed when i discovered Mount and Blade, still in it's beta, and i just loved it, the battles sure, but specially the recruiting and training of your men. Battle Brothers has that same feeling in its recruiting, maybe better, as it's focus is in a small group of men, there are a lot of more characteristics in each of them, and some of them really stand out.
You get to love your men, and you will surely grieve them pretty fast at the beginning. It's really hard to get unscathed out of a fight, and it's pretty common to lose at least 1 man. I usually hire one or two newbies in each town, and they usually are the ones killed instead of my veterans.
The combat, as you can see in the video, is akin to Final Fantasy Tactics or Fire Emblem. Your equipped itens may present some different moves to use, and it's pretty interesting figuring out who will use which weapon. I think 2 archers and 2 man with weapons with greater reach are advisable when you have the full 12 man team.
And the Devs are always updating it, always bringing new stuff - in the last update they added War Dogs and Goblins, mixing up the gameplay and standard players strategies.

87,17233896,english,"I only recently found out about this game and loved the overall idea of it but was a turned off by what I had seen of the combat. Even after watching a few gameplay videos I wasn’t that excited by it and planned on giving it a miss (as much as I loved the rest of the concept).  I was a little surprised to see a demo being offered (as it is rare these days) so I decided to have a look at it and I am glad I did. 

The combat system is very enjoyable and feels quite polished already. There are enough subtle nuances to support a range of tactics (depending on equipment and enemy faced..!) and the design is quite well done. 
Demo link:
http://battlebrothersgame.com/downloads/


Combat:
-	Characters are represented by busts only, no animations. Don’t let this put you off… the artwork is incredible (armour getting damaged, units getting bruised and bloody etc) and I think it actually fits well with the abstraction of turn based combat.
-	There is no facing/flanking taken into account (allied units always face to the right, enemy always face to the left). While this seems like a significant downside initially, the overwhelm mechanic is actually a relatively elegant way of dealing with this. 
-	Fatigue. In addition to action points you also have fatigue (actions add to total fatigue up to a characters max, total fatigue is reduced every turn). If you can’t ‘afford’ the fatigue cost of a move, you can’t do it. Wearing armour reduces your max fatigue, the heaver the armour, the bigger the reduction. This is something that some people don’t like but it is a feature I love. It is a great way to add a little more (abstracted) ‘realism’ to the relatively familiar turn based AP combat system.
http://battlebrothersgame.com/tactical-combat-mechanics/


Strategic map. Very well done overall. Will be familiar if you have played Mount and Blade but includes day/night cycle.

Interesting points:
-	A lot of the game is randomly generated so locations and strengths of enemy factions, towns, outposts etc will vary each playthrough.
-	A town’s prosperity depends on trade with other towns. If a town’s caravans are continually getting ambushed and/or the town is raided often, it will directly affect the support they can give you (eg. Equipment available) 
-	The above point also extends to the games ‘quests’. There are the generic ‘filler’ quests (eg. I need this token package delivered to X town) however the real contracts are based on the towns actual ‘needs’. Eg. If a town’s caravan is continually getting ambushed, they will ask you to escort it (while a town with safer routes won’t offer that contract because they don’t need your help). You can also get contracts to deal with enemy locations (eg. bandit hideouts etc) however it isn’t a static quest; if a force from the local castle/outpost knows about it they may deal with it first. 
-	The stronghold/outpost tasks also dynamically evolve based on supply levels/resources, manning, knowledge etc.
-

The melee started out well, no damage taken and some given, but the arms of men grew tired and heavy. We were unable to keep up the shield wall, and sometimes unable to even to do any more than defend the torrent of claws. 4 men became three, three became two. Some beasts were felled, some fled, but they were still to many. In time, one man stood before 4 werewolves. 

He was unscathed, but he was exhausted. He was scared, but he could not flee. He was surrounded. So he fought. He killed one, but his armor and helmet were shredded beyond usefulness. He stabbed at the wavering wolves, as if he could fill them with fear by filling them with the cold steel tip of his spear. He killed one as it turned to flee, killed another that got the same idea. More -- one, two, he couldn't know -- howled from the nearby darkness. And one stood before him, flailing at him with its claws, the claws found flesh, and he bled, but he continued to fight.

3,16967866,english,"This game is still in the early stages but despite some issues it has the potential of being a very good game. The game play is rather straight forward and the company development is interesting and make you want to keep them alive to see how they develop. Things are still rather linear for now and can be frustrating when in combat on your newer recruit has only 14% chance to hit and always seems to connect while you veteran gets 80% a misses every time he attempt to hit anyone.

Another major frustration is that the enemies seem to die very hard when totally surrounded. You would think that the advantage of attacking an opponent on all sides would make it a full gone conclusion but far to often that is not the case. I have lost members of my company more often than not when the last enemy is surrounded and should be crushed. However ,it is early days and one hopes that those events become less likely.

One last current annoyance is the lack of feedback as to what is happening. Why do zombies resurrect time and time again and how does one stops this? I mean how often do you have to kill the same opponent? Also the damage received and dealt is not very clear. The current side interface that does explain some of what is going on is not very clear and makes the events happening rather guess work. A number value on hit points, armour points would be better than a small simpler bar showing the current state of affairs.

Despite the complaints it is a fun game. The idea of adding magic, factions, town and city development would make it even better. I would recommend giving the game a chance as it is rather old school but in a very good way and I sure the money provided by your purchase will help the game develop into a potential gem.

6,16901245,english,"Bought this game the other day and way more addictive than I would have thought.  Solid turn-based combat with nice RPG elements.  Reminds me of a game I used to play as a kid - Fantasy General - in some ways.  There's way more technical critiques on here that are good but the game definitely gets my vote.  For an early release it's polished enough to be a lot of fun for 20 hours or so.

Some suggestions for future upgrades:

Day/Night Cycle and Marching - The game has great resource usage, days passing, and interesting/impactful vignettes - most taking place 'in camp at night.'  I'd recommend having movement more turn based with your company marching during the day and camped at night.  Makes the vignettes more realistic and could add a whole new dimension to the game.  Setting your march time/speed could impact the readiness/fatigue of your troops.  You could have options for setting defenses/watches at night, etc.  It could make caravan escorts more fun as well to march alongside the caravan with a turn - but be ready for attacks at night.  Enemy structures could have 'zones' of operation - meaning the danger of raids on your camp or caravan increase.

Size of the Company - 12 is great for shield-wall and RPG intimacy.  But, doesn't feel like you're really building a powerful mercenary force.  As you progress it would be great if you could 'promote' a member to a team/squad/platoon/company leader.  Then you could recruit more mercenaries into that formation - but the icons could stay the same, maybe with some mini-portraits at the base of the character icon on the battle map.  It would allow you to keep increasing the size of your force to be more and more powerful.  The same would go for your enemies.  Would be a way to increase the difficulty and scope of all the different types of enemies.

Support Personnel, non-combat - I love the use of food, maintenance, ammo, and paying the troops.  It would be awesome if your company could have a hireable/modifiable support staff you could manipulate as the mercenary band commander.  A blacksmith/armorer to maintain/upgrade your equipment, a paymaster to keep the troops paid/fed, a medic to heal the troops - you might even consider a spy/scout leader to affect the fidelity/distance of information about the enemy.  Opens a whole new area for effectively managing your mercenary band.

Flag and Shield Design.  Using the symbols provided let the player design their own flag, then paint their shields with the logo as well.

Reputation - I've seen this suggested other places and think it's a great idea.  It would be awesome to have your actions impact your reputation with factions - could effect pay, enemy encounters, available jobs, cost of items, etc.

Prisoners/surrender - You could have a certain portion of enemies (or your own) not die outright and be available as prisoners at the end of a battle.  You could ransom them back, recruit them to your company, get extra pay for bringing someone back alive, etc.

A couple of things I don't care for as much:

The elevation mechanics seem like they still need to be worked out.  Mine don't show up well in the graphic interface and advantages/disadvantages aren't as apparent.

Fatigue, it's a good concept but really penalizes heavy troops.  It would be nice if there was a way to get troops able to wear heavy armor without having to level them up so many times.

Levels should keep going past 11,

Would like to be able to compare equipment effects a little easier - and more varieties of equipment.

Would be nice to have some control over how battles start when you initiate - aren't ambushed.

Battles can go on quite some time trying to chase down fleeing or retreating foes.

No way to toggle a character inactive when you're in the final stages of a battle and trying to finish off the last couple foes - but are limited with how many troops can attack.

All-in-all it's a great game with a ton of possibilities.  I really hope you keep improving it and it pays off financially for the developers.",1436134067,1436218079,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True,76561197970949596,354,1,16147,0,1319,1570916414,,

The only issues with the game in it's current state appear to be that of balance issues and no mid game followed by a crushing end game lol and early game is pretty damn tough as well. 

But all that aside the game is great if you like roguelikes and it is particularly fun to play. 

In terms of what I think it needs for the future we could use a better mid and end game, and some more variety in terms of missions. Also the game could use more in terms of ranged weapons i.e. more bow and spear varieties. I would also like to see more variety in terms of gear such as heraldic shields and mail that accurately reskins itself upon equipping to the colours of your warband.

If you enjoy this gaming niche, you should try this one. Already solid gameplay in alpha, and there is a lot potential.

So basically gameplay is set in two parts: Strategic world map actions and Tactical combat

1)Game is on early alpha currently, but tactical combat is already well implemented.

 2) Strategic Worldmap is only partly implemented, there will be more factions and more interactions with factions planned( considering it is early access, it is already pretty solid)

Here is how devs are stating worldmap in website:

""On the procedurally generated worldmap different factions exist with their own agenda and resources, struggling for survival and dominance. A strategic AI leads each faction towards its goal by making use of its resources while staying true to the lore of that faction. Factions own locations on the worldmap – villages, camps, crypts or similar – and send out parties from there with objectives such as patrolling the area, hunting for food or raiding an unsuspecting village.

The player jumps into this living world and affects its balance by his actions – but the simulation works even without the player intervening. This way, the game does not have to rely on pre-scripted or linear events but provides new opportunities of adventure every time based on the dynamic interplay of its inhabitants. Furthermore, the player’s actions make a real difference. Preventing that orc raid on a village has that village able to offer you more in trade, and even just killing a single orc leaves the orc tribe with one less warrior for future encounters.""",1435239138,1435239138,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True,76561198076353066,190,6,28494,0,2265,1600445645,,

Great game, Mix of Mount and Blade, Darkest Dungeon and Final Fantasy Tactics. Worth a Buy without a doubt

Update #1 06/05/15
The game has been updated literally everyday since release. The creators are doing a fantastic job debugging the game so early on while adding new features already, can only get better

Update #2 15/05/15
So another 2 weeks or so gone by and the game shows no sign of slowing down regarding updates, the developers get a congrats from me. Too long have developers taken the money and ran, these guys are the ideal developers when it comes to early access

Plenty to still be developed in terms of frills and nice to haves but the core game is sound.

If you enjoyed xcom, the early fall outs and jagged alliance then the team building aspects of this should appeal. Graphics are clunky but the immersive quality is there in terms of ownership. You develop your own unit and you need to look after and protect them (well some of them not the cowards, disloyal or morbid grave diggers obviously)'. Protecting them is hard, especially with the random nature of deployment prior to a battle. Maybe that adds a touch of realism but it would be good if you could deploy as you preferred or even set a battle order.

If the team keep working on it and improve some of the features and graphics ( I found woodland battles a bit cumbersome) then this could be a classic. Certainly feel I've had value for money and intend getting in some ideas for how it could improve with relatively little devlopment ahead of any release e.g the early troops you are set up with would benefit from you selecting from a list of available characters rather than the blind random generation which can deliver some real no hopers.

All in all, an excellent tactical mainly turn based game (the wider map operates in realtime with pause) with plenty of opportunity to indulge in RPG and character development even if they do all look the same with their helmets on :)

43,16079933,english,"Battle Brothers is a tactical game where you manage a mercenary company of up to 12 characters in a procedurally-generated fantasy medieval world.  You should like this game if you like small unit medieval games like Mount and Blade or tactical games like X-Com of Jagged Edge.

You start the game with 3 randomly-generated characters who have statistics covering their hit points, chance to hit, defensive characteristics and other combat-related skills.  You get starting cash to improve their equipment and hire new characters, but you will also need to do quests to keep maintain, equip and expand your company.  

All of your mercenaries have backgrounds that (mostly)  modify these statistics for the positive, or negative or both.  For example, the Bastard -- Err -- Illegitmate Son has bonuses to their melee attack skill, but minuses to their morale and melee defense.  In addition, each character may have 1 or more other traits like Dastard which means they cut and run on you easily if combat starts to go sideways.  And yes, you can have a Dastardly Bastard.  

The game randomly generates a world populated with a city, several small towns, towers and a castle.  Each of these offer a shop, a place to recruit more warm bodies for your company, and quests.  As of the end of May, the quests are not all that varied.  You can earn money for escorting caravans, delivering stuff on your own to another town, or finding and destroying monster lairs.

The combat is excellent and where the game is the most fun.  Bandits, orcs and undead in various varieties inhabit the lairs or wander around the map.  They hunt you down if you are weak, and run from you if you are strong.  Combat is turn-based and your mercs and the monsters go in order of their initiative.  Combat is very similar to X-Com.  What makes it very tactically satisfying as that your attacks vary by weapon.  While all have 'normal' attacks, each have one or more special attacks.  Heavy weapons allow you to attack multiple adjacent enemies (and sometimes friends), axes can destroy shields, spears impale enemies moving to attack you.  My personal favorite are the pole weapons, which allow you attack monsters from two hexes away - meaning you can form a shield wall have have your pikemen attack from behind it.

The combat is also brutal.  Your characters will die -- especially early on when you are likely to have less armor.  You have two armor locations -- the head and the body.  These add extra hit points, and when they go away, damage goes straight to your characters (although some weapons can bypass armor).  Shields add to you chance to avoid being hit.  The problem is many weapons can kill unarmored characters in one or two shots, and in long combats they work through your armor.  Also, when armor is damaged, it needs to be repaired and that takes time and repair equipment.  So if you have several combats in quick succession, you may need to have vulnerable people hang back.

As you characters level up, get to increase your characteristics and also add traits you choose from 3 skill trees.  (Offensive, Defensive and a utility/leadership tree).  

The game is in early access and lacks a cohesive plot and sufficient variety of enemies and quests.  But the bones of this game are still a lot of fun in its current form.  The good news is the developers just quit all of their day jobs to focus full time on the game.

Leveling up is both frequent and meaningful and you can build even unskilled vagabonds into the stuff of legends, although not quite as legendary as that hedge knight with the enormous battle-ax,  taking some of the sting out of his inevitable death.  Interesting and unforgiving battle mechanics, fun and accessible party management system, still lacking in a few areas; perks are limited and extensive prerequisites tend to railroad you into the same build,  procedurally generated content tends to spiral out of control as time goes on (it's not really fun to fight 50 orcs at a time when your capped out at 12 dudes who die forever when their hp hits 0), the quest system is a bit samey and generic, and there's little unique story content at this stage,  but we are still in early access with plenty of time to get them worked out.

Then the enemy turn comes around, and they kill my entire army because they seem to miss once every 6 hits, its bloody infuriating and I have restarted 4 times because of it, I have flanked 3 guys around a single enemy, only to miss every single swing and he kills 2 of them.
So god damn annoyed

UPDATE:
Just went to play another campaign, my archer, who apparently was a poacher and comes with a bow, misses 5 shots IN A ROW on an enemy archer, in which the other archer scores 3 in a row and kills my archer.
I have 2 men around one of their macemen, he blocks 1 shot and the other 3 miss, and he proceeds to score 2 in a row killing one of my men. Next turn I miss both my shots and he kills my other guy.
My last guy is moving up to kill the archer, finally get 2 hits on him, he manages to move away, next turn I am toe to toe with 1 of their guys, I miss both of my shots again, and he hits me twice with both of his and I lost.

I came back to the game, cause it seems really fun and has such a pull. I loaded it up, different strategy, instead of buying the best armor and weapons (which also weighed a lot) I went lower in, medium to light, and its pretty fun, I actually beat the first battle without losing a single guy, and once you overcome the possible hump I had, its a really fun game, changing the review to recommend.

54,15894661,english,"Well, I don't really like doing Early Access ""reviews"", but I feel I've put enough time into the game and the game itself is already established and fleshed out well enough to warrant a review. Just bear in mind that parts of this review will likely become outdated the further along the development of this game progresses. 
Firstly, Battle Brothers, for being an Early Access alpha game, is very stable and polished. Bugs are rare and seem to be fixed rapidly. The game mechanics themselves are already solid and well implemented. As long as development of the game continues, I'd have to say Overhype Studios is doing a fantastic job and is a trustworthy developer. 
The game mechanics are typical, but done very well, for this type of game. It's standard fare turn-based combat with a mild amount of role-playing elements. Overall, I'd compare the game to a mixture of Expeditions: Conquistador and Mount & Blade: Warband. 
Battle Brothers is brutal. Your troops will die, you'll find yourself frequently frustrated, and sometimes overwhelmed. The game is set in a dark, low-fantasy medieval world, and every battle, no matter how small, is gritty and deadly. If you're someone who doesn't enjoy challenging games, then this isn't really a game for you.
The art and look of this game is awesome. Some people probably won't like it, especially the ""game piece"" way units are presented on the battlefield. Personally, I like it, and I think it's done exceptionally well. Damage and condition are viscerally and clearly shown on each unit, as well as what armor and weapon they currently have equipped. You can essentially tell how any of your battle brothers are doing just by how they look. It's very cool. As is the fact this is all hand drawn and not your typical indie pixelated mess.
All of this having been said, Battle Brothers does currently have a few issues. This is an Early Access game, that means not everything is implemented yet. Eventually, I found myself bored with nothing to do. It's really only the first few hours that are the most fun. Starting a company, getting through that critical period of making money, buying equipment, barely scrapping by - it's challenging, fresh, and exciting. However, for me, the game tends to hit a point where it begins to feel stale; you're in a limbo where you've cleared much of the map, have a full company of battle brothers, and plenty of equipment and crowns (money). I hope the devs add more long-term and ""end game"" content to Battle Brothers to alleviate this. There's also another issue I have with this game.
Much of the game is procedural. The map layout, the three battle brothers you start out with, quests; almost everything. This adds replay value to the game, but it also makes it unpredictable in some not so good ways. For example, it's possible to start out with three battle brothers that suck, on a map with towns spaced very far apart, near a city that offers a bad mix of recruitable troops. If you're not experienced with the game, this can prove very frustrating. So, be warned. You may, or may not, like the randomness of the game. 
Ultimately Battle Brothers is a solid, challenging, and fun game. It already has a great foundation and shows a lot of promise. I'd definitely recommend it to someone who likes turn-based games or anything in the vein of Mount & Blade.",1432004843,1432004843,True,17,0,0.602898955345153809,0,True,False,True,76561198021922182,334,32,4668,0,2379,1553403120,,

Yes, it's early access.  No, it doesn't feel like early access.

Why should you buy it?  I'll tell you!

The game has a level of polish that you rarely see in Early Access, let alone a finished game.  Even for Early Access there is enough to do to get your money's worth out of it.  

You start with three mercenaries, and you recruit more as you go from city to town to city to castle.  Want another mercenary?  You see some possible recruits hanging out in the city center, and you read their back stories (because they legitimately have back stories, and you better read them carefully... their stats are tied to them!), you find one possible recruit who used to be a butcher, but he wants more excitement in life... so you recruit him.  His stat bonuses look pretty good!  He's got +melee skill and +fatigue and no negatives, heck, he's even loyal!

You outfit your crew with the available gear at the blacksmith... switching some items around because they're just too heavy for some of your new mercs to wear... gotta work on that fatigue!

With weapons in hand and armor girded you choose a mission and head out into the countryside to fight the Open Graves of the Heimlands Battle.  It's deadly to hit it head on, so you wait for roaming bands of undead to pour forth and engage them one at a time. 

After many battles a few of your mercs have learned new tricks, and skilled up.  Your former meat carver looks like he's doing well.  So, you engage the open graveyard head on... it doesn't look so bad now.

The battle is bloody, and you find yourself outnumbered 13 to 5.  The fighting is fierce, and your heroes are only alive because of the new armor you had obtained for them... which is now in tatters.  Shields broken, weapons failing, the last of the undead is slain.

Surveying the battlefield you note your old friends are still alive, and one of the new recruits... but the butcher has fallen.

His memory won't be lost.

Time to return to the town and claim your bounty... it better be worth it.  You've got gear to fix, wounds to heal, and a new recruit to pick up.

Hopefully this one won't die on you.",1431614793,1431614793,True,62,5,0.791317999362945557,3,True,False,True,76561197978481717,194,15,20149,0,1813,1594699849,,
62,15821777,english,"Im really enjoying myself playing this early access game Battle Brothers. Managing your group of mercenaries going about in this open medieval fantasy world. You are to take up contracts from merchant for earning of your coins and it is up to if you want to fulfill or break the contract, seeing how the situation goes. The towns and cities are randomly generated with every start of a new game, as well as your starting mercenaries.

The combat is a turn base strategy which means combat is RNG and you have to do some management in terms of your AP, fatigue, HP, resolve, initiative and gears. Your mercenaries do level up through combat and you could choose which skills and stats (increasing of stats are interesting as you only could choose 3 stats and it randomly gives you an increase number from 1-5) to increase. Do take note that if one of your men got killed, he remains dead throughout the game, which leads you having to take up new contract with new men and to re-train them from low level up. 

Currently, you can have only 12 men at any given time (until further down the dates where the developers will be adding in helpers and might be able to increase the number of roster of your men). Still, having just 12 men doesn't make the game any boring at the current stage, due to the permanent death mechanics.

76,15752537,english,"TLDR: Game is good enough to make me write my first review - but this is all subjective - your mileage may vary.

Good:

1. Open world - a nice map, somehow invoking a certain Darklands feel. I personally enjoy the fact that not every single nok and cranny has some content - I find the emptiness in some areas create a nice frame for those areas with cities, enemies stronghold etc., a juxtaposition of civilization and wilderness.

2, Squad management - already satisfyingly rich and detailed, with plenty of options and depth to get into. Character backgrounds and traits are nicely described without running too long. They allow one to create a nice impression of one's troops and make your squad more like actual people.

3. Quest/contract system - I find it refreshing that they are not all ""save the world from"". There is some variation: escorting, scouting, fighting. They don't sseem that much scripted, but rather taking advantage from the open world, e.g. when I took a very handsomely paying escort mission, I htought I will be beset by ""unexpected"" ambushers the whole way, as per the genre standards. In a surprising twist, the road was calm - but maybe even more stressful because of that.

4. Graphcis - I find them charming, clear to see what is what and pretty enough. 

5. Tactical battles - playing on normal difficulty, they were good enough - I don't have experience enough to see if different groups of enemies have widely different tactics (e.g. orks more prone to charging headfirst, while rogues preferring to attack from the flanks) but the AI decently uses its troops and terrain.

UI - the devs say they will improve it significantly, but already I did not have any significant issues with it.

BAD/MY WISHES:

1. A world map would be a huge help, especially when deciding on a contract.

2. I wouldn't mind being able to personalize the leader of the company more - not to put them on the field, more like giving them separate experiewnce based on contracts fulfilled which in turn provided boons like cheaper recrutiment, additional contracts available etc.

3. Factions and standing with them, diplomacy in general - if I say raid caravans originating from one town, it would be nice if they would consider me an outlaw and send their troops after me. Also with the enemies, allowing for a some kind of cease fire or even cooperation with them.

4. I wouldn't mind female characters for players and enemies - just for some variation,

5. Headquarters - a single, fortified camp to call one's own, to return to between contracts and to further customise with trophies after victories and upgrades for the benefit of the company.

OTHER:

Currently, there is only a video tutorial on youtube but I found it easy enough to pick it up from simply playing and reading the tooltips. Be aware that I've learnt this approach on Europa Universalis series with their lack of tutorials, so yeah.

Lack of main quest line - it will be added. I don't actually miss it, it will be something nice to have, but I have fun already as it is.

I rarely give positive reviews for a graphically unimpressive game where you move around pseudo-matroska dolls. (Although, the art is fantastic.)

But I never give positive reviews for poorly designed, unsupported games.

Play Battle Brothers- in fact, there's a free demo on the website. If you at all consider yourself an Hardcore Tactical RPG player, it is deserving of your money.

The combat is brutal, unforgiving, simple in it's basis but deeply complex as you learn more of it. The economics of your mercenary band and the wider world around you is far more intricate than the linear trade caravans & roads system suggests.

The developer team has literally patched this game seven times in seven days since EA release. A bunch of players complained about a bug on the forum, and the bug gets fixed hours after the complaint is logged.

I made a suggestion about perk balancing, and it was implemented immediately, patch appearing less than 12 hours later.

84,15731763,english,"[h1] ~Meadow's Review~ [/h1]

The game of 'Battle Brother's is currently in Early Access and may not represent it's final quality. However the game is pretty much in a beta phase - there are some bugs here and there but mostly nothing major. The gameplay is solid as well as completely playable with enough to do. Mostly your mercenary company ends up death though! There is however no 'story' yet besides the initial quest at the start. You can do pretty much everything: Find and destroy ruins of enemies (Orcs, Bandits, Undeads, Werewolves AND Vampires!!!). Deliver packages who seemingly seem to be like, not of importance.

Until you get ambushed by 3 bandit groups who want to kill you for it. >_> Seriously what's in this package?
Furthermore you can escort caravans as well. Sometimes nothing happens and you get a fat paycheck. Sometimes you have to plough through too many to count bandits to escort your caravan-contract to safety. Seriously, what is in THE caravan to warrant 5 groups of bandits to come at me? These also have guards, but they're feeble compared to your mostly better equipped and massive* company. However the 'find [name] building' contract is sometimes confusing as you may not be able to find it at all, thereby wasting valuable time. I wish there was a speedup button as well.

*Depends on how much mercenaries you recruit, and how well you arm them or are armed from the start. No warranty for survival.

[b]Pro's:[/b]
+ Combat works great! The enemy has access to the same weapons and equipments you use! Except special type's such as Orc's hammers/axes or special enemies. When you kill them though and you survive you can loot their special equipment. Find out if you want to wear them despite the penalties!
+ Contracts! Do Escort Caravan, Deliver packages, Find Ruins (This is not recommended), Destroy ruins for hard cash payments!
+ Salaries to pay your mercenary! Don't forget the food! Tools required for repairs, ammunition restock, and herbs to heal up! They also have stats for themselves, find out which ones are best for yourself.
+ Equipment! Decide for yourself how to equip your mercenaries! Two handed Axes! Swords! Shields! Super-heavy-fatigue armor! (Best protection, slowest tank ever. No guarantees on survival!)
+ Good value for real life money. The game is already playable and fun to play too! Sometimes annoying though.
+ When defending caravans, allied patrols or towns/cities/towers/cities, the garrison will help you as well! Sparking massive battles.
+ Loot! So satisfying to loot your enemies after winning the battle!
+ Developers are very active on the forums as well as updates! More features coming right up! Check the forums.

[b]Meh-Meh:[/b]

+/- Realistic arrows! Can hit your own men or allies as well if you're not careful.
+/- Finding ruins quests can be quite hard to locate. Payments are not very good either if you can't find it within a reasonable time.
+/- Travelling between towns. Really needs a speed up button if nothing special occurs.
+/- There is a high amount of fatigue for weapons or certain actions. This can pile up very quickly. Balanced or not, it can be annoying at times.
+/- There is almost no recover time between battles that are forced upon you, while the enemy comes in fresh and reinforced while you're wounded and your equipment battered down. Although realistic, not really much choice to retreat or winning with losses on your side.

[b]Cons:[/b]
- Damn you RNG! Sometimes you can't hit that guy you overwhelm with many allies or mercs.
- Enemy can potentially one hit your guys. Thereby laying waste to your super levelled and better equipped mercenary.
- Repairs takes too many tools as well is too slow for the higher tier armor.

TL:DR; THROW YOUR CASH AT THEM NAU
Score: 8/10 Worth the money spent (Atleast 1€ = 1 hour for this score €_€)

P.S: If you have more cash, you can throw some more with the Digital Deluxe or Supporter Edition. The first one gives you the soundtrack, second one some goodies like the Digital Lore Book as well as the first Legendary item Fangshire. No impressive stats, but it's meant to be a 'thank-you' and not a 'buy this to get an overpowered legendary item' so you're informed.",1431031880,1431032303,True,2,0,0.514584481716156006,0,True,False,True,76561197992815754,207,6,26012,0,1671,1600248317,,
85,15730666,english,"You know, I bought this game on a whim because I was horribly, horribly bored. But now here I am playing it for the second day straight and loving every second of it. In this Review I'll discuss the Pros and Cons, as well as perhaps maybe what I think would be great to include/change about the game.

Pros 
- AI is very simple, yet very well done. AI actually responds to the happenings of the battlefield, causing the enemy forces to employ new strategies. 
- The character backgrounds/traits, OH MY GOD. YES, MORE, PLEASE. While you expect to lose characters in the game, it's always nice for them not to be clones of each other, could do with more names though. >_>
- A nice, simple (and hopefully to be expanded upon) selection of weaponry and armor to pick from.
- Resource Management is a constant, but isn't hard if you know what you're doing.
- It's good to know you can run to a town/tower/castle/city to get some backup in the form of ally troops in case you're outmatched, soldiers've saved my company numerous times. 
- The diversity in the quests thus far is small, yes, but they're similar yet just different enough to not make it repetitive and boring. 
- The skills/level system legitimately does show when in combat, and it's worthwhile to really try to preserve those veterans. 

Cons
- Lost Souls, if there's more than five of them, all they seem to do is wail, and make everyone flee regardless of how brave they are. This basically makes a supposed Puny fight so annoying, and so friggin' hard. 
 -Very hard start off, as there's no real 'sanctuary' from the roaming bands of enemies, and they follow you everywhere. Savescuming is an all to present temptation, on top of that, they keep pace with you regardless of how small your party.
Daily pay is very annoying, and sometimes escorting caravans to long-off cities can bankrupt you if you do it as a starter mission.
- Fleeing enemies do not leave the map, instead they just hide somewhere, causing your group to have to play hide and decapitate with them, for an upwards of possibly ten minutes.
- Orc Youths are probably smaller and weaker...right? So why can they charge and stun my characters like the Warriors/Berserkers? When you're facing a massive Orc force, your entire party can become insta-stunned by a line of shirtless prepubescent Greenies. 
- Outside of the friggin' Lost Souls, the other undead seem woefully under-powered, and there's just not enough of them to even it out. Even if there's Fallen Heroes and Necromancers in the group. I'd love to see some Zombie-Knights that basically are complete tanks, or something.
- Citys/towns that are objectives of missions for say, Escort or Delivery, are seemingly at random, causing you to only get 140 Crowns for an across-the-map trek, or 1360 Crowns for going to a town literally half a minute away. 
- Lack of overall places-to-be, it would be nice if there was more to do in the towns.

Suggestions
- One thing that would be awesome? That party limit? Yeah, add an option to turn it off, perhaps have multiple levels of it too? As I am a major RTS fan who enjoys large troop counts, and I feel like it would add a new perspective and difficulty to the game in itself (managing a company of 12 men is /waaaaaaay/ to easy after maybe ten minutes of grinding). Besides, it's 2D Graphics, there can't be that much resource-drain on having a 50 v 50 battle (good golly, Ms. Molly), I'd think.
- Undead gaining numbers as they wipe out caravans and perhaps Bandit/Soldier parties? It'd be cool to see that.
- Other Mercenary Parties to interact with. Why not, right? Could be fun if you made a rival, or trusted ally, or crap, just picking a fight to see who's top dog. Mercenaries ain't really that civil, yo.
- Weapons, Armor, and lots of variations! I'd love to see a greater diversity, although the current amount is nice too, but after a short time you seem to get the best stuff (except Coat of Plates armor....can't find that at freakin' all, sorry Alvar.)
- ......A....private.....settlement/Castle that can be purchased? Let's you store soldiers there, perhaps levy taxes and such, also a local place/safe haven to rest, recruit, and who knows what else?
- Rival Kingdoms? Allows you to perhaps pick a side, raid and pillage and plunder as Mercenaries did, while under the banner of a king. 
- Different race mercs. It'd be nice to be able to find some Orc Berserker slogging down drinks and hire him, rather than just seemingly commit genocide on his entire race. 
- Different races in general?
- While I guess it could be put under the whole 'weapons' suggestion, Muskets/Arqeubus? Slow reload time, but devastating damage, perhaps multiple ammunition types.
- Random Events! A damsel in distress! A friggin' village fire! A chest found in the middle of a forest! A young runaway hiding from his former owners.

Conclusion:
The game is starting off, yes, and it's got a great one at that. I really, really, /really/ like the game. But it would just be nice to have a bit more free-play to it.

87,15720711,english,"Right now let me begin by saying this game is very early access.

the quests are random but right now the varity of random quests is not alot so some repeat alot, for example quests to protect caravans or to attack bandit camps.

The game itself is solid though. it feels like you are leading a mercenary company. its gritty its dirty and at the end of it you get paid well! if you survive that is!

let me also state this game is very playable and although as ive stated quests do tend to repeat the gameplay right now is endless. so basically you explore a large world map and do what you can to earn gold while leveling up your mercs.


PROS

feels like your a mercenary leader - makes me have great hopes for this game.
each of your mercenaries feel unique and when they die you do kinda miss them and their story.
has loads and loads and loads of potential.
the art style is actually nice and suits the game, even if the graphics are basic, I think the art of the world helps draw you into the role of a mercenary leader.

CONS

Still early in its development - has lots of good stuff in it but still needs alot more.


ok so basically this is the only negative I wish to list right now, the game is early access and as such I have reviewed it as such. the game oozes potential and I hope that this game eventually gets developed fully.
it really draws you in, makes you feel every battle and makes you worry about who will die next or who you hire.

SUGGESTIONS

If the developers do read this I have some suggestions.

add the ability on game creation allow the player to customise their paymaster - basically this is the main player. he doesnt fight just leads and gives perks to his mercenary company the pay master could level up or earn reputation.depending on the quests that are completed or failed

add Rival merc companies that will race you for contracts, ambush you on the way to contracts or if they are first to towns recruit the mercs there and buy up the good items.
limit the space in the stash- make it so you need to hire donkeys and horses or carts to carry your gear and this slows you down.

more missile weapons needed -  different levels of bows and crossbows.


if you like early access games and you miss games like warhammer shadow of the horned rat or if you liked the hire aspect of mount and blade I definitely recommend this game.
I wont score the game yet as I feel it is way too early for this and I will be keeping my eye on the game and updating my review.

I don't know where this game came from, or how the development team knew that there were people like me out there looking for an unforgiving, turn-based combat rpg in a medieval fantasy setting. Don't get too attached to that level 6 character with the pimped out gear, either. You will die. A lot.

Pros:
* Great turn based-combat system
* Good RPG/skills system
* Unique graphical style - the ""egg soldiers"". It's really grown on me.
* Yes, it's early access, but this feels polished already.
* Your hardwork will eventually pay-off - you will equip and skill your guys to a level where they can actually survive consecutive battles.
* Already been three bug updates just a handful of days after initial release.

Cons:
* Start of game is tough - took me about 8-9 attempts where my squad wiped in the first or second battle.
* Not a great deal of content as yet outside of the combat - be prepared to escort caravans and run errands from one side of the map to the other for a pittance.
* The best gear - armour/weapons/etc - don't respawn very quickly. By day 50 in my current game, most the stores are generally quite bare. This may be by design.
* Once you get a solid core of 6-8 guys who are armoured up and at or around level 8, it's currently fairly easy to make money and win battles with minimal loses - again, this is probably due to an overall lack incontent outside of the start game period.
* Some minor bugs - dead battle brothers turning into zombies who I can't target, the unpassable water tiles bleeding over into the grass/non-water tiles a little too far and making you stuck, etc.

Pros:
- Great turn based combat gameplay
- I love building my own mercenary company and seeing them get steadily stronger as they level up (and having some die as I go along).
- Sandbox style gameplay in that you can pick the quests I want to do, and travel at will between cities and castles.

Cons (are due to it being EA and incomplete)
- No campaign yet
- Currently, it is at its most challenging at the start (when your company is poor and units poorly equipped).",1430693627,1430693627,True,4,0,0.538610935211181641,0,True,False,True,76561198022216986,313,15,30348,0,901,1597992437,,

4,15671612,english,"This game has a catchy name. No fancy out-of-this-world fantasy high power name. No sir. Battle Brothers is as fitting as it could be given you will be playing a game about brothers in arms that will fight and survive together, for the dead are better be forgotten.

It is still being developed mind you, and still it already delivers such a relaxed and maniacal game spirit never seen since Jagged Alliance and Mount and Blade were delivered to us.

And why JA and M&B ? Exactly because. Imagine the relaxed tabletop stuff, with figurines and turn based combat. Now add to that a high medieval setting with a taint of fantasy ( not too much, just orcs and other interesting creatures ) and you are set for the fight of your life.

The artwork is very very pleasing. No shiny false reflections, no colour degradation nor explosive orange FX. No no. You get hand painted artwork. Digital it may be but everything is hand drawn/painted. From the map to the chest up figurines.

Music. Fitting enough and quite easy on the ears after 30 hours. Mid way between GoT main theme and Pillars of the Earth soundtrack. Not too much heroic nor too dull or offensive on the ears.

Mechanics. Pure fun. All the figurines are represented chest up and show EXACTLY at all stages all the stats of the shields, armour, weapons and state of mind of the characters. So they can have chainmail bursting across all seams, a shield barely hanging together and wounds across their face and torso. On top of that, and depending on their will to fight they can be grinning, with a rage face, or in pure shock.

This simple visual effect almost dispenses any need for HP bars, morale levels and whatever UI that can distract you from the main purpose - kill them all !!!!

Very few games also managed to code fatigue. Battle Brothers makes it a ESSENTIAL tactical element so deployment, equipment, initiative, etc and fatigue are things to manage throughout the battle. And I am not kidding that when in the worst moments your guys can be so fatigued that they barely can hold up their shields or even swing their weapons in any coordinated fashion...

But the best part, which I find extremely important, is this - everything is procedural. From the backgrounds of the henchmen you can find and hire to the map and battle locations.

This leads to the most awesome combinations and multitude of characters imaginable with the most interesting traits, which relate a lot to their own biographies. You can find Knights of course, but also Fanatics, Farmers, Flagellants, Miners, Thiefs, Assassins, and a shit ton more. Traits vary from the normal Coward to the more interesting Asthmatic so you can start to guess where it all might be going.

If you played the Jagged Alliance, XCom stuff like a power gamer you won't even appreciate the beauty of this game.
Great part, if the not the whole part, of it is going with the flow and trying to wok with what you are offered, be it mercenaries for hire or missions to accomplish.

Let me say that one of the least promising meat bags I hired - you start with three Founders ( also totally generated ) - and then hire other guys to die for them ( literally, you do not want to have a Founder dead... a puppy drowns every time one dies... ) - as I was saying, Imagine being ambushed by a shit ton of raiders... your band is full of gluttonous fat asses or asthmatic shield draggers ( literally my warband is a collection of fighters that seems fit for a old age care center or a obese rehabilitation center... they all suffer from something but that is part of the fun )... and then, out of the blue come this figure.. Falk Earthside... the most unimaginable figure to become a great warrior - after all he was a lowly miner with such prowess for battle as I do for knitting ( yes, I almost killed myself with 3 colours... ).

This Falk Earthside took business like no other. His love for the billhook saved the group many many times since the very first fight. Forget Captain Shepard and saving the universe. This asthmatic death wielding badassoftheweek will be recorded in the annals of whatever chronicles my Historian fighters feels fit to write.

Now, after many many days in the River Pirates Falk is quickly becoming one of the favourites to be Captain. He always grins at the prospect of battle and seeing new recruits being mauled to mushy bloody sacks across the forest.",1430668371,1430668786,True,13,2,0.611536204814910889,0,True,False,True,76561198007100674,253,25,3496,0,2198,1586452946,,

Set in a somewhat grim, low-fantasy world with a bit of German flair, Battle Brothers puts you in command of your very one mercenary company. Travel a procedurally generated map full of mystery and danger, defending the locals from bandits, orcs, werewolves, and the undead, and explore completely randomized locations where no two battle maps are ever the same. The art style of the game is fantastic and the core gameplay is engaging and at times very challenging. The game as it stands is already a much more complete game than just about any other Early Access title, and as long as the developers continue to patch the game and add new, interesting features at their current rate, this game will be a must have.

A really solid core gameplay experience, as mentioned everywhere it feels like Mount and Blade, although obviously in early access so much less content, and less roaming friends/enemies etc on map. Combat is lethal and enjoyable, don't get attached to your crew! 

Combat is turn based hex combat with characters that look like board game pieces: upper body showing the weapons, armour, and getting injured as the character does. Being decapitated is nicely animated and quite depressing as it should be!

So the devs have laid out a roadmap to add a ton of things, and really I can't wait to see this stuff implemented. Factions, story quests, its just what this needs.

When they have filled it out properly, there is immense potential here to expand the game with DLC for alternate races, which would also be brilliant; as they are not rendering 3d models of every different character, you would hope that it isnt a gigantic ask to implement this - and to expand the world map.

Anyway, for now solid mechanics on display, in the current version there isnt a massive amount to do other than just grow the warband, and take on tougher enemies, but I'm having lots of fun with just that because the gameplay is good.

This is exactly the game I always wanted. Delicate 2D graphics, equipment and battle systems, world background, map and possible mission settings are all great.

A few suggestions:

a) increase the ""blows feeling"", when my axeman hits the enemy, I want to see the figure steps forward and the axe moves ahead toward the enemy swiftly(as I can see the shields move up a bit when in shield wall status). If I could ""see"" a sound effect graphic brust out from the enemy's head ""Pow!""/""Ow!"" I would appreciate it very much :) 

b) add the player to the shield wall as a must-live role without wage, rather than the invisible office manager. Also consider some special npcs(battle sisters) with their own stories and missions.

c) maybe some higher level battles e.g. two earls with their 50+ npc servants fighting each other and my 12-men squad could add one side and influence the result(or not). And another mercenary squad appears from behind at the middle of the battle(in-battle events system maybe).

d) havn't find out if their is any castle system, if not I hope to add one, after all my men need a place to rest and make my own equipments.

e) some details like ""the side effect increases with the fatigue level"", ""most attacks could damage both the armor and the health(a bit)"" etc.

20,15629334,english,"I am going to be brutally honest about this review. I am going to nitpick and say what could be (This is Early Access) I will be doing this because I absolutely love this game. Personally it's if X-Com & Mount & Blade had a beautiful baby. Now, you're asking me; ""Is this game worth buying in this state?"" I will say, for $20 no. BUT it can be worth that very very soon and possibly hopefully beyond that. 

Right now the game feels stable-ish but a lot of the content feels missing. There's not much to do other than do a few contracts and die to werewolves. It just feels empty to me. Again, I am not bashing the game I just want it to improve and I hope the devs see my concerns and at least consider them. I do not want to assume how hard implementing more stuff will be, I am not an expert.

Devs, if you are reading this, I am sure you seen/considered all these suggestions before but please consider potentially adding the following 

More contract variation; attacking a merchant cart for rival merchant, assassination, escorting public figures, etc.

Add more things to the map, more towns, more castles, more unique-ish locations you can visit (perhaps quests you can stumble upon exploring the map to earn a new ""legendary"" battle brother or legendary/unique artifacts I heard was possibly getting added?)

Possibly consider allowing us to create our own weapons? We could use tools and supplies and other things as materials to create our unique weapons. (AND LET US NAME AND PUT OUR OWN DESCRIPTION)

Allowing us to potentially hire non-human battle brothers? Maybe for example an orc, werewolf, undead. 

Adding more fantasy or original races. I mean I don't want it to be a fantasy cliche but more races to fill out the map won't be such a bad thing right? (perhaps friendly races)

This would probably be low on the list to add but perhaps more backgrounds & traits for your Battle Brothers? JUST A PERSONAL OPINION: As well as making the current backgrounds more 'noticable' as in making the positives higher as well as the drawbacks so you get more specialized Brothers.

Allowing us to have our own mercenary guildhome? Where we can let our injured brothers rest faster, have our own smith to create custom weapons, train our Brothers, stash our weapons/loot/money/supplies, and other things I'm sure you guys can find more uses for.

A reputation/karma system: influences the contracts we can take as well as how high the payout would be. For example if your company is well known enough you'd get contracts to personally escort the King or some cool stuff like that. Karma being if you took evil contracts and did evil things you'd get even more evil contracts from seedier people that would allow you to assassinate officials, poison a town's well (I'm not judging) and other things.

Don't skimp on the unique/legendary weapons/armor/accessories, for lootlovers such as myself a game with tons of unique loot is a game that has multiple playability just for the loot itself.

I already seen that you guys plan to flesh out the UI, I hope there was some discussion on a follow caravan/unit option and a straight to/follow road pathfinding option that allows us to decide if we want our company to just cross a mountain that's in our way and prolong a simple fetch quest 50000000000 years or just take the roads there.

Enemy mercenary companies you can take out for a monopoly on contracts (higher payout?) or to poach their best members to your company. I mean surely we aren't the only merc company out there are we? D:

I mean theres plenty of other things I'm sure I could think of but I don't want you guys to feel like we don't appreciate the game or telling you how to make it. These are just things I hope you guys could consider to make this game truly amazing. Devs: if you're a bit shorthanded I could help with some of the writing ;) lol

This is even hightened by other perks that chars can have in the beginning (like fast/fragile/brute etc) that give them benefits or maluses. Permadeath makes things more interesting; Once you land on a real good merc you'd want to keep him alive and start throwing beggars and characters with maluses to front line and pack your favorites with best armour. 

Troops level up, and have three different skills trees in addition to normal stats.The world and factions (orcs, undead, werewolves, bandits) are immersive and graphics are innovative if not flashy.

Lok’tar humans!
This is a review of fun XCOM style, turned based strategy game, Battle Brothers, developed by the indie German developers at Overhype Studios. 

Currently as of April the game is in early release, which can be unsettling because you are buying essentially an unfinished product, but that shouldn’t dissuade you if you want to cough up $20 and like a more sandbox open-end adventure for roughly 6-10 hours of content to enjoy.

The main premise of the game is that you control a band of mercenaries in a randomly generated, medieval fantasy, war-torn country.  Each character in your party has a detailed back story such as a scholar, solider, vampire hunter, or a simple beggar.   You purchase these characters to increase your band of mercenaries to the max party size of 12, as surely some will die along the way in this dangerous field of work.  There is an initial fee to hire them, which can be much higher based on the characters skills, as well as a weekly fee to retain them.  Some might easily desert you, while other will remain loyal to the end even if you run out of coin; they’re mercenaries after all.

There are plenty of weapons of all shapes and sizes.  You can build a fighter and bash other NPCs using the hex grid battle system.  Or you can try to riposte and counter when someone attacks you.  As your characters level up with each successful battle encounter, it is pretty detailed, you can increase many stats like their willingness to stand in the face of other comrades dying, health points, defense, and attack power.  Also there are talent tress or perks that can be offensive, defensive or utility, again adding a little touch to each character as you level.

There are many monsters: werewolves, skeletons, orcs, zombies, and bandits, which makes the battles even more dynamic.  Orcs might charge across the battlefield and stun your front line warriors, while zombies will appear out of the earth as the fight persists.

This game is someone reminiscent of Darkest Dungeon party system with a hint of difficulty, and a somewhat vast world.  Currently there is no overarching story, and consists basically just quests to explore other cities, escort trade caravans, and destroy enemy outposts.  I’ve only had the game crash once, and it AutoSaves before each battle just in case something goes wrong.

For $20 you basically get 6-10 hours of fun medieval strategy combat.  For this game to really improve it will need more detailed quests, an overarching story, and maybe an MMO/multiplayer feature, or server feature would make this game insanely popular in my opinion as it has a no holds bar difficulty, and fighting other players would be fun.  Also currently the battles are like a chess game, where a character, or piece simply hops into a designated hex.  However, it would be nice to see a full model, like we do in XCOM with full animations.  Maybe also adding a captain to lead your weary battle brothers would be a nice touch as well.

Overall I recommend the game, and give it 8.5 orc axes out of 10, with a lot of potential to occur in the future if Overhype Studios continues to add features, because the game has good value where it is.

28,15602759,english,"This game caught me by suprise! A mashup of my two favorite games: X-Com and Mount&Blade.
My dream game!

THE GOOD:
-Game is punishingly difficult, a positive in my opinion.
-Procedural world generation which provides a lot of replay value, even in its early development state.
-Traits and backgrounds system add a lot of character to the brothers. 
-Really like the art style and the variation of appearance of the brothers.
-Combat sounds are VERY well done. The weapon impacts sounds are great.
-Quests are generated depending on the state of the game world. Really cool.
-Good combat AI. The AI will intelligently take(and fight for) positions on the battlefield, form battle lines, and exploit weaknesses in your lines. I'm happy the devs didn't skip out on this part. Makes the battles more intense and dangerous.

THE OK:
-Combat relies heavily on RNG. This doesn't bother me much, but will definately annoy some people. There is enough variables in combat though to allow for tactical play.
-Limited amount of quest types, although I'm pretty sure more will be added in the future.

THE BAD: (Game is still in development, so these things will most likely get fixed)
-BUGS. As expected, there are various bugs in the game, althought the developers seem quick to fix them.  
-Can't think of anything else...

A definate thumbs up from me.",1430257909,1430322806,True,10,0,0.542445719242095947,0,True,False,True,76561198002437114,326,1,12597,0,789,1582840740,,

31,15606694,english,"In my first battle against the starting quest bandits, my party of 6 got wiped except for a sole survivor, one of my founding brothers. He broke near the end of the fight and left his brothers to die while he fled for the edge of the map. 1 Turn before he would have crossed over, his morale recovers and he stands and fights against the 2 remaining bandits. He's only got a few HP left, no head armor, and about 1/3 of his armor left, so he's 1-2 hits away from dying, but he manages to make it through and kills the 2 bandits to redeem his honor.

The gist: Tactical combat is simple, but fun. Very RNG dependent though. Strategic mode works, but is very basic: You can equip and level your characters and you have to manage resources. Nothing beyond that. Lot's of potential, but the tactical combat is worth at least $15-20 right now, imo.",1430288611,1430288611,True,2,0,0,0,True,False,True,76561197985016810,4666,5,1797,0,663,1508816636,,
32,15593392,english,"I have seen Battle Brothers some time ago as an early gameplay video. There are a lot out there from the guys from Overhype Studios on Youtube (well done and even funny at times), as well as many more since the release of Battle Brothers to early access.

Back then I thought: well, looks promising. Going to follow its development.

NOW I can play it. To make it short: Even in its early state it is quite challenging, thrilling, rewarding and just so much fun! Right now there are around 10-15 hours of really enjoyable gameplay in it.

But be warned: it is a hard world. Brothers a going to die. You cant stop it :-)

Like Jagged Alliance (some of you might recognize my picture - I’m a huge fan of JA2 1.13)
there are to kind of layers: the strategic worldmap and the actual fighting hex based combat maps. One works in real time with pause, the other is a round based system.

The guys of your Battle Brother crew can level up, improve in a lot of stats an can get new perks/abilities from tree different branches of skills. The search and saving up money for better items is well done and motivating, the fights themselves offer a lot of tactical possibilities. 

There are different Factions (Raiders, Orcs, Undead, Werewolves, militia)

Some Advice: 
Use Spears (Spearwall!) in the early game a lot
Use the high ground if possible
Difficulties: Puny, weak, average (weak already quiet strong at times!)
in most situations its better to keep your band together
Shields should be the standard for most of you’re guys
Repair important equipment (alt+right mouse button). Equipped Items are being automatically over time, if you have enough tools
Do not forget to loot after a fight (a patch giving a remainder is to arrive shortly)

It's the bastard love child of X-Com, Jagged Alliance 2, and Mount and Blade.  I know that's been said before, so let me summarize:  Do you want to play a game with strong tactical combat (turn-based) and character building?  Do you revel at the chance of victorious combat and brutal failure?  Do you like the idea of running a functioning mercenary company in a fantasy medieval setting?  Try this out.

Even in its current form it's an incredibly satisfying game.

The current version of the game is a bit buggy and crashes sometimes, but i see great potential in this game. 

There's great immersion in grim hard reality. Death and injury is all but certain when playing this game. What makes it so epic is that you get a sense of kinship with your battlebrothers as you progress and do battle, it's like you get to know them and their personalities (which they have) And you're sadden by their loss when they fall in battle. Like in real life, a battle can go from good to a sheitstorm in a flip of a coin when you're not careful.

The combat system is very deep and with the options you have available to you it will be some time before you've explored it all.
