5,77037282,english,"If the gameplay development keeps going like this, this game can become something more than average.
At the moment however, I can not recommend the game, because it is still too empty and bland. This was just released too soon.
Performance-wise, the game is just horrendous! I get 60+ fps with my 2080ti which is totally playable, but somehow craftopia only lets my card idle at base clock. (Heard others complain about the same thing with different cards).
Therefore it is no surprise that many people can not play the game with acceptable frames.

Early Access or not, a game you throw out there to be played with so little to do and severe performance issues, costing over 20 bucks is an absolute insolence!

But that is how it goes nowadays with early access titles: Quantity over quality.
Hope you prove me wrong in 2021.

How do I make an infinate chicken battery charger?
Whats the most efficent way to harvest wheat?

It's not super difficult to play right now and I really like that, I'm looking to do what I want to, when I want to, not be constantly forced to progress or slog out some shit just to get basic rewards. I've spent like six hours playing, mostly farmed and ran from bears at first, now I have a base, a bunch of shit I a can build, leveled up a bunch, and just finally got through the first dungeon and went to the next world. I dunno how to put it, but the developers have really done a great job of mashing all this awesome shit into something even more awesome; 5 + 5 = 11 today, frens.

I hope the developers continue to improve the game because this thing is like almost everything I want in a game. 11/10 considering its still early access. 

Note: I haven't yet tried multiplayer but I'm going to later today. Single player has just been a shitload of fun so far...

UPDATE (150+ hours later):

Still haven't played multiplayer but totally stoked to...

* Game definitely hits a wall in progression while it's in early access (I personally still find it fun to grind small things out while we way for more to do... but yeah, it should be noted).

* There isn't much variety in biomes but it's expected with future updates.

* Dungeons have two treasure chests behind walls at the beginning and end of the level (behind the portals). Didn't realize this until recently... got a lot of dungeons to crawl back through.

* Breeding things is cool, but I wish I could breed Anubis with Giraffe... I know a whole franken-verse of fucked up creatures is a big ask but damn it would be awesome.

* Would really like the level cap lifted, stuck at level 50 right now.

* Would really like to be able to give Anubis mo' tablets; right now I have roughly 40 I'm not using.

* Skill point refunds are pretty unforgiving as you have to give up a skill point to do it (after the first one, plus 100k gold)

* A (real usable) blacksmith or way to upgrade existing weapons would be awesome and is supposedly in the works but I want it _now_.

* Love that you can bring your character to different worlds (i.e. select your existing character, hit ""new world"" and start off on the intro island at level 50!)

Playing this game I've been a humble peach farmer, dragon slayer, and a wizard. I have a chest labeled ""Shrooms, Herbs, and Coke"" that is full of mushrooms, herbs, and cocoa. I can breed animals, humans, and monsters and do so for no other reason than to extract their feces (literally, and I love it best mechanic ever... just wish there were colorful poops or a way to poop faster).

Stoked to try multiplayer, I was hesitant because I didn't want to start a new character, BUT I found out earlier this week you can bring YOUR EXISTING CHARACTER AND MAPS ONLINE in what is like the single best, most player friendly, design choice ever. I almost shit myself I was so excited when I found it.

28,76940557,english,"I know this game is still incomplete. So this review should be taken with a grain of salt. Or a whole shaker. 
   The enemies levels are inconsistent with the damage they do with regard to the characters level. Me at lvl 22 getting whooped by a Bull at lvl 14.
    Enemies glitch in and out, and move at random. 
    Some enemies just continue to run in circles at full speed after being attacked. Making it extremely difficult to attack the enemy.
    Attacking an enemy with a special move will sometimes move the character beyond the enemy. Or passing past the enemy, completely wasting the move. This happens frequently. Even jump attacks move way past the enemy missing them entirely. 
    Mouse controls are very floaty and slow. I have my sensitivity set at 100% and it is still way too sluggish and slow.
    Placing items for buildings is a bit unwieldy. Sometimes the floor will not place on the ground, but rather 4 or 5 feet off the ground.
     Weapons degrade really fast. Its not really a bad mechanic, but I think a slower weapon degrade without repairs would be better. 
     Bland scenery. Nothing really too different between all the worlds. 
     Way too high variety of minerals. Iron, dry iron, very dry iron. rinse and repeat for all other minerals. 
     
There is a lot of potential here. But in its current iteration I would wait till full release.

*Second entry (3/10/2020)

After playing Genshin Impact, it seems like this game is lacking a bit with Mihoyo's Genshin Impact.  This game is quite fun, but somehow Genshin Impact is still a lot better since it is story driven, while Craftopia is just a generic crafting game, AND GENSHIN IMPACT IS FREE-TO-PLAY, AND AVAILABLE ON MULTIPLE PLATFORMS!  The combat system is quite clunky, and there are even time where the bosses stuck into the wall, making the game less immersive AND amusing.  Hope to see future updates for this game.  Come on, Craftopia's devs, you can still do it!  Try comparing your game to Genshin Impact, and try making your game better, with better physics, better animation, and better graphic.

Character models look..awful. Its clear this was originally only designed with a female character in mind, because the male stuff looks awful.

Building..is a nightmare. I have spent hours trying to put a wall on the ground, i am 90% sure the building mechanics are based on luck.

Other than that, its pretty fun. I would have preferred some minor changes though.

Bonus Round! (Some issues i hope the devs fix)

'Catch with legally distinct notpokeballs'
This is terrible. They only sometimes work, when they fail they sometimes fly away 20m away, and you kinda need a farm to do them 'right' and even then its not satisfying. Also theres a bug with the generators, so, shrug.

'Farming'
Kinda horrible. The platforms fall into the ground, and if you have them on a stone floor or something, they fall through those too.

'Durability on items'
Fuck you. Thats the durability. Everything is extremely low, Other games let you repair using the same cost for creating the item, Not here, You can pay some gold to reduce the durability until its useless, or you can just go back to your thing and build another one. Why? Who knows.

'Vehicles'
They're..a pain. I'd like to be able to store my vehicles but nah, nah...you just wait until they float away or explode like a mini-nuke.

'Got wood?'
Hey so you got those bots that say in their description they're for chopping wood. But they arn't. They're for crops. And if you want a nice lil wood farm? Not even in the game. So what is the purpose of the wood retrieving bots? Who even knows. They should  retrieve anything, but what do i know.

'Houses'
So how come theres only like one window & door building item, in the crappest wood quality? Stone windows / stone doorways? Nah.Have the fortnite pack. Matter of fact, nearly all the building materials look like fortnite.

'islands'
they need to be bigger. Like 10x bigger, and less enemies spawns, sprinkle the enemy spawns about, but make them more dense. Really the only good place to build is on an islands beach because its the only place with some near-flat terrain.

The current release is lacking in a few areas. I think the first thing I would like to see polished would be the building. Currently you are locked onto a world grid without true control about where you place things. Flat ground is hard to find and the buggy placement can make setting up farms very annoying. Placed items will sometimes fall through the world and cause an error, the game tells you when this happens and gives you the item back, but it can still be annoying. I even had this happen items that had been generated in on the island I was on.

That being said, I still think this will become a great game if given the time and attention to detail it needs. I think it is important to give smaller developers a chance, because AAA games nowadays tend to be overly formulated. I would rather support someone trying to make something unique, and while Craftopia does borrow heavily from BotW, I still think it is a far cry from the cardboard cutout games I was referencing.",1601412930,1601412930,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True,76561198073327316,85,7,1119,1119,1086,1601750008

Crafting is easy and straight forward.  It can be a little grindy but to be honest I didn't find it that way.  Most items are really quick and easy to craft.  It's not really that hard to gain tiers to unlock more items, although at this time there are only 3 of like 7 tiers. 
The dungeons are a nice addition and allows something to do other than just crafting.  They actually give crafting a goal that you don't find in other games in that you created better more powerful weapons and armor to be able to tackle bigger and more difficult dungeons.  I also like the somewhat fantasy vibe, although hoverboards and helicopters ruin that vibe early in the game.
The things I don't like about the game is the use of a magic wand instead of a hammer the build stuff.  It takes away the any type of feeling of actually building stuff. Instead of being Joe Carpenter or Joe Mechanic, I'm Harry Potter instead.  Also, the game is kind of like Fortnite in being able to create structures on the fly.  Yes, you can literally run and zap walls and slopes into existence in front of you as you go.  Animal sounds are horrible but I am assuming they are only placeholders for different sounds in the future.  It made me laugh the first time I heard a seagull, it's basically someone squeezing a dog's squeeky toy. 
 For right now it is not worth the $24.99 to play the game.  The game is extremely new at this point and they are a long way from anything even being close to working right.

- It also has the weapon degradation from BotW. Thankfully you can repair your items in this game, but you do lose max durability with each repair.
- Crafting and Inventory from typical survival games, along with the resource gatherings too.
- The combat is a hack and slash, magic slinging and arrow shooting joy ride.
- The building from Fortnite... (It is simple, but you know where it is ripped from.)
- It also has some nice automation from games like Factorio, Satisfactory, etc. (It is pretty basic so far, but the fact that it exists in a game like this is fantastic.)

Is it without its flaws?  Of course not.  It doesn't seem to be quite as optimized as it could be, but I was also hosting three other players when it started to feel draggy.

Things froze up when we entered a new area for the first time, but we had no issue the second time we opened a new land.

The farming and automation systems are really cool and fun to experiment with, as there are multiple ways to set up your farms no matter what resource you want to obtain. There isn't a ""best"" way to do anything (yet). You can spend hours at your base just messing around with the different mechanics and creating new ""contraptions"" I guess I can call them. You don't need to be out exploring to have fun in the game. The mechanics are unique and you can capture any NPC in the game and bring it home lol. 

Now to talk about the combat system. Right now it feels a bit wonky, but no where near ""bad."" with more updates I think this game can have some very smooth fighting experiences, as they are already decently smooth as is. Some of the spells are really cool, like the tier 3 ice spell. The mob AI needs work for sure, and so do the dungeons. Right now, they are just enough to be fun, but with some added content they can be really really immersive. I can see the dungeons becoming very deep and challenging one day. The skill tree already has a very good amount of variety and you can unlock some really awesome abilities. 

My main point in this review is that POCKET PAIR has given us a really solid early access game that has the potential to become one of the best survival rpg games. There is already so much to do and if they polish some of the features in game it can be amazing.

88,75467368,english,"Uhm...so yeah...it's hyper early access. It looks like it's aiming to be a anime hybrid of Minecraft and Ark Survival Evolved...which...is interesting...The story starts with you...pushing a big red button...and literally blowing up the earth lol...and like...god thinks you deserve a second chance and has this...furry lady basically be like ""By the way. You murdered 6 billion people. You may not remember but you definitely did that."" Almost she cannot believe a murder of 6 billion people is getting sent off to another mystical world with the task of rebooting humanity or something. Idk. It's made by a Japanese dev team so i suppose it would be strange if it wasn't a bit weird right?

Anyway. The premise is interesting but and...while I'd like to recommend it,I can't in good faith seeing as to the devs decided to give us access to a game that can't even rotate structure pieces. And the snapping is severely wonky. And I'm pretty sure the devs have never seen a vehicle before outside of GTA as their vehicles have a life span of roughly 2 minutes before they go totally nuclear and kill you. As you're mounted on the Motorcycle, wether or not you're riding it, it will take 30 some odd damage every few seconds. when it hits zero, it blows up and takes out you and everything around you for 1000 damage. So yeah. You're forced to kill animals to make batteries and use them to create a motorcycle that will kill you after two mins of usage. It's not even funny. It's just straight up bad and pointless. Why would anyone bother with all the effort needed to build a bike that lasts 120 seconds before detonating and killing you  where you stand?

The combat works. mining and logging works. crafting works, building...not so much. I mean it's possible i'm just missing a step or something but the floors were at eye length so...idk.  It's just really wonkey. I managed to build a house thanks to my experience with fallout 4's settlement system but man even then it was still a fight and a half to get it to work.

This game has a ton of potential tho so it might be worth picking it up just to see how it grows over time (Assuming the devs are serious about finishing this game...and assuming they actually finish it before taking a page off ark's book.)

I really hope the devs work on polishing the base game before working on any additional content and i desperately hope they actually finish the game before launching a million dlc lol. Looking at you ARK.

The game while having minimal character creation allows you to play as a...what i assume is a ""Non-Binary"" character which is interesting. It seems to be a purely inclusive thing. It's funny and cute. doesn't actually affect anything tho.

There seem to be 2 more races planned, elf and demon so that will be interesting i suppose.

If you're looking for an Anime ARK, this isn't it. at least not yet. It's super fresh out the oven and it shows so...just know what you're getting into.

I hope they consider adding some logic to their vehicles and create a generator for the Frontier age that...you know...doesn't require working your animals to death to charge highly expendable batteries. The hearts floating around their heads as they kill themselves don't make it feel better. If anything it kinda makes it worse. If you're a sociopath then i suppose it's not a big deal but it really makes using generators uncomfortable for me. Especially considering I can create a modern effing motorcycle but I can't figure out how to create a modern generator?",1599285405,1601264652,False,3,0,0.473967671394348145,0,True,False,True,76561198067877117,131,23,1142,49,1142,1601264043

1. To finish translating the item texts. (There are still a few Items and enemys that are still described or named in Japanese I feel this is a fairly easy fix.)

2.Make some foundation Items for buildings or make it so walls can go into the ground somewhat because having parts of your house dosen't make much since. 

3. Make it so you can carry over your vehicles to diffrent Islands by either picking them back up or by being on them when teleporting. (The vehicles are a awesome part of the game but as they are right now there not convient to use espically  for how much they cost to make.)

4. Make chicken noises less frequent and more quiet. (I dont personally mind it but I have heard a lot of complaints about when watching streams.)

5. Increase the turn rate on the hover board it feels like your trying to turn a semi truck and makes it feel less natrual to use.

6. In the intro the goddess is talking to fast making it so she either talks slower or where you press a key or button to continue onto the next text would make it a lot more smoother.

These are just some things that I feel would be easy to fix that would make the game a lot more fun to play as it is for now in the short term. I know the devs are working hard and are very busy but I feel these few changes would make the game a lot more fun and playable. I still love this game to death and hope the devs are able to make this a absolute awesome game I would still recommend getting it.

8,76645785,english,"This game is some kind of special clunky mess. I'm honestly astonished this game has a positive rating. This is a prime example of a game that wants to be too many things too fast. I get that it's early access, but almost everything is so very poorly implemented right now, that rather than adding more stuff, they need to fix what they already have. The only pros that I can give this game is that the aesthetics, sound effects, and automation items are all pretty great, but that's about it. The dungeons and NPC's are about as plain as they can get and lack any kind of depth or charm. There's lots of rushed work in places, like rocks or trees floating just above the ground. The skills look nice enough, but there's no targeting system and your crosshairs only seem to loosely swing attacks where they're aimed at, often missing your target or hitting something else that's just barely between you and them. The monster taming system is a mess. You can attack and kill your own tamed monsters, and they don't even really do anything most of the time. Sometimes the obvious intended way it seems you should be able to complete a dungeon simply doesn't work, and you can just cheese a lot of them by building floating structures in the sky, which seems to be the only time they snap correctly. When you're on the ground, the snap grid for building is all over the place. They're multiple resources with different names depending on what they dropped from, but they all do the same things, cluttering up your already small inventory. Most of the monsters have bare bones AI and don't really do any kind of appreciable damage to you. You're more likely to die from doing something stupid like falling or setting yourself on fire. There doesn't seem to be any vanity slots even though there are clear descriptions on items stating they can be equipped there. Certain items equip where your shield would be, so unless you have your shield on your hotbar, you have you re-equip it through your inventory, which is really dumb. If you get hit or try to switch too fast when switching tools or weapons, it sometimes won't switch even though the new selection will be highlighted, causing you to swing the previous tool or weapon while a different one is highlighted. You can accidentally destroy your own storage chests from really far distances with more than just fire if you're not careful. I somehow hit mine with ice mine from half way across the starting map and destroyed it with everything inside, which is completely stupid. The list could go on, but I've already written a book. I could only recommend this if they fixed all of that. xD It was kinda fun to goof around and cheese the hell out of different things because of the broken mess that it is for few hours, but that's its only kind of charm currently and that wears off pretty quickly.

Second: I've seen some people complaining about how the ""game haven't had any major updates YET and it's still buggy""... the game  is barely one month old dude, chill. The studio develping craftopia isn't exactly big nor rich, so let's give them some time and see how things go; buying games on early access is just like betting on a casino, sometimes is a jackpot sometimes you've spent money for nothing. Still, it has potential and a promising core rpg mechanic.

Regarding their other game ""overdungeon"", which they aparently abandoned, we don't really know the reason, we don't have circumstantial information about the situation and again, they are a small team. They probably didn't have enough people to work on both projects and just put everyone working on craftopia. 

But yeah i actually had fun playing this game and i hate most survival games. I have traumas with early access games but i'm going to give this one a chance. 

But the catching system just sucks, really sucks... Be aware that you're going to spend a lot of pokeballs to catch a simple sheep.

I understand that it is early-access so honestly none of those things actually affect my review of this game since I knew what I was getting when I bought it. Now with that out of the way, I really do like this game. It is a mix of LoZ:BotW, Pokemon and Ark/Rust with numerous other games sprinkled in here and there. I'll try and break down the mechanics and what I like/dislike about them so I don't accidentally right a book.

1)Crafting/Base Building:
Pros-
* Simple to use
* Don't need to remember crafting patterns like in Minecraft
* Plenty of things to craft with more being added on a regular basis
* Bases can now be protected from mobs spawning in them
Cons-
* Is hit or miss on what Enchants you get while crafting(more on those later)
* The base pieces can snap to the ground in stupid ways and you can't rotate them very much

2)Combat/Enemies:
Pros-
* Multiple ways to build up how you fight
* Swords, Magic and eventually guns
* Mobs can be relentless
Cons-
* Magic can take a while to learn with the leveling system
* Mobs can be a little too relentless(especially the Lizards)
* Not a lot of variety to the mobs

3)Enchants:
Pros-
* Wide variety of enchants
Cons-
* Some enchants are only applicable to consumables, but still end up on equipment regardless
* When crafting it seems to just pull 2 random enchants from the items used to craft it
* With the above stated issue it also can be unusable enchants that are applied
* The enchants on basic items like ores, leather, fangs, etc makes it so they can't be stacked

33,76589328,english,"What a pleasure this game is.

It feels like Breath of the Wild had a child with No Man's Sky and tried to teach that child the importance of The Elder Scrolls Morrowind.

As a base, the game takes a little too much from BotW, But at the end of the day, it feels like it was supposed to be mechanically anyway. Get gear, level up, craft equipment, fish, climb, cook, sell... It just feels natural. Combat is exactly what you would expect, except the part where being Link felt grounded, when the going gets rough, you can bolt away from most things and glide away, as it has two speeds. 
-It also mixes mechanics so well that if you like one concept or another, you can play on those strengths until you get the skills or gear you need to either feel comfortable with the combat, or feel comfortable with the crafting and equipment mechanics. 
-Overall, it feels like they targeted a lot of the quips people have had with crafting games such as, bad combat, areas being too large, carrying weight being too cumbersome, moving inventory to stores taking too long, etc. It isn't small, but it also isn't too big, but if you want more there are so many areas you can visit, and if you want less all you have to do is make money and get enough materials to press into new areas... Just watch your stats, you might get mowed down if you go too far.

Now, allow me to explain why the similarities are what they are in my opinion.
-The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild
Obvious... But running, exploring, combat, gliding, dungeons, loot, inventory UI, even some of the things they are going to add feel like someone loved BotW so much that they wanted to pull everything they could get away with while adding their own personal touches, even some things like skulls the goblins hide in and the excessive amounts of scout towers they look out from feels verbatim to say it lightly, heck, even the way Link gained hearts or stamina by visiting shrines is in here. But when you like something so much, but just want to add your personal touch to it, I would imagine a fan wanting to go about it the same way. Frankly, the games mechanics work so well with the feel of BotW that you might want to forgive them for borrowing a little too liberally at times, though I hope they find better ways to do so, because it feels a little overdone sometimes.

-No Man's Sky
The game spreads itself around locales that has varying levels as you progress, and as you progress, you can take any and all materials you pull from the environment aside from the door you use to leave the locale you're in and the one you arrive on. There are differing environments, habitats, enemies and resources that you can harvest, and even capture monsters and NPCs that you can bring with you across locales to build the perfect instance of whatever ecosystem you would like to have. This addition to the gameplay design allows a lot of forgiveness for the otherwise small building area, but also leaves so much untouched potential for things like survival, and randomly generated islands to take on with your friends, or alone. You could even try to be timed on how long it takes you to get to the god's alter from scratch, and get on a leaderboard or whatever. Regardless, this mechanic is basically the band aid that makes the game stronger than it should ever be if used properly.

-The Elder Scrolls: Morrowind
Now... Morrowind fans might get a little bit irritated at why this is here, but with the addition of traited equipment as well as equipment that grants a spell on it that you can cast when equipped, the game has the potential to be so intricate that it can be utterly broken in the best of ways. 
For example, equipment has a chance to adopt traits from materials to used to craft it. Normally that means using various materials and hoping that those traits get adopted, to the point where a few tries of rare equipment could expend the materials altogether. But if you make a bucket, or a ring, or an arrow... You could get those same powerful effects without having to lose your mind over the chance normally required to get those things to happen. So now your equipment bag is full of arrows, buckets and rings that allow you to adjust your character without having to flip your blacksmith desk. Far out right?! I hope they never change this. 

-Another fantastic thing about this game is the automation potential, you can breed animals you catch, mass produce crops and have robotics manage your areas with some know how. Even have mechanizations deal with ore deposits (bedrocks) that are otherwise futile to mine physically. If you have the need to do more things, there are options there that provide you the tools to automate everything you need if you get the materials to make it all. 
-There is also no weight system, so if you set out with the goal of getting ore, each item type can hold four stacks of items of its own type, and supports different inherited values too. So if you got tired of how long it took for you to move your ore and wood in other games... Just come here and play this one. You can carry like 5000 logs. I hope they up the amount of equipment space you have though, and add support for dying clothes. As it is now there are only 8 armor sets. 4 for each gender, and 4 of which are just recolors of the different two types for each gender. There are supposed to be vanity clothing coming... I'm very excited for that too.

Well, there are a few gripes that I do have, but they might not be that serious. 
-In crafting games, investment is almost necessary, maybe actually necessary. So when you buy a spell for the first time and use it, and consider starting over because you know if you put those two points into jumping you would jump twice as high, it gets pretty annoying. Do yourself a favor and try skills with a throwaway character so you don't get burned by a bad description, or a bad skill overall. They said they were using a translation thing to translate, so, it is what it is.
-Sometimes fighting an enemy over the course of a long time might make them disappear between night or day. I remember fighting a dragon and not being particularly ready offensively, and ended up watching it go up in smoke when the day was over... It might be a mechanic so you don't catch enemies you aren't technically ready for, but it freaking sucks when you go back to your base and have to sell off all the weapons you just wore down trying to fight that thing... Maybe it was a bug, but Christ if there are more challenging fights later on, I really don't want to be mechanically told that I either have to only fight things I can plow through or not even try. I beat it after I did the Morrowind thing above. But I won't expect that to be possible with future enemies.

Should you get it? I'm not sure... For me, I told myself that I wanted something like Genshin Impact to waste away on, but I lost all interest in it after I saw it was free-to-play. I played a few other crafting games like Dark and Light, and Citadel Forged in Fire, and while some of those have more intricate item gathering mechanics, and bigger maps as well as a more tolerable fast traversal option. (the hover boards are super clunky in here...imo, didn't make the others yet) Overall, this one feels the most like a game that you happen to be able to build in, instead of a game you build in, that happens to have exploration. Though I will say that other survival games handle traveling in the dark a little better. But if I'm honest, unless Monster Hunter, Lost Planet or Dragon's Dogma make a survival game with all of their mechanics intact, it'll be hard to top the limitless potential this game has. If you're like me, sure, give it a go. But if the games that come together to make a game like this satisfy you on their own? Come back when regular people are playing the game on YouTube, and draw your conclusions from there.

I had to re-create a new character after the first few minutes though.  I discovered Justice Kick, Justice Smash, and Justice PUNCH.  Obviously the new character's name was Mumen Rider.  

The devs said it perfectly when they said they took all the things they like from other games and glued them together.  Graphics and gameplay akin to modern Zelda games, crafting like all the other survival games, great RPG attributes, and a respectful homage to Mumen Rider.  Progression in this game is similar to satisfactory but not nearly the grind.  

What I most appreciate is the groundwork for the future implements in this game.  Currently a lot of skills are blocked for future use but at least you see them there.  There are some items that are either described or named as WIP which is again, nice, to know they will hopefully be implemented.  My only concern for the future is if the devs continue forward with the game or this becomes a 10 year experiment with my dreams.  If this ever gets to full release, I have zero doubt this will be one of the greats.

As for the game's current state; Automation is something to work for.  The first few stages have you merc'ing mobs and gathering materials to craft more stuff.  It is easy enough to build yourself a setup where you explore and offload into a multitude of crafting stations, rinse repeat.  Then comes automation which changes the game almost entirely.  I've only played multiplayer but found just two bugs.  One was the enemy animations were sometimes laggy.  The other was when the party played different dungeons at the same time.

🕹[ Mechanics]

So let me start off, wow I've played Decay of Logos which takes the concept of BotW and flips it into a dark souls kinda title. This took that image of artstyle which by no feat is easy on your own I might add but I think this game tries too hard to be too many things than just one type of game. Focus is more the general direction because many of the features I see in the trailer seem to be ""fluffed up"" in my opinion. From a high level character and skills and vehicles and items used in the trailer alone would let alone push you further than 4 hours to obtain. The mechanics are more geared towards keyboard and mouse and on the unity engine no less. But in my two hours of play I was able to complete an island and open the gate of transportation to then see that I have to pay in game currency and a slice of my materials to move to the next island on a grid wide map. From this start I had assumed that the tutorial level was supposed to be small and behold they all are small islands.

From the beginning the expectation was you destroy a world and create a new one, this sadly isn't true. I had assumed it would be like Empyron or Space Engineers in the vision of scale as far as world generation but it isn't, think of more a micro manager on islands. Here I assumed too much and got very little as far as substance when it came to assumptions.

Don't even get me to where combat and survival come into play, your combat skills and items are all hotkey'd to the same 1-0 hotbar. So be prepared you'll be spending lot of time in your inv menu, changing out your gear and building tools for food items, weapons when they break, and tools when you need to smash down a wall. !!!Highly recommend a modular hotbar for building, combat, and magic at least 3-4 different bars or at least a modifible hotbar system that prevents having to open the menu every time something new happens.!!!

One of the biggest gripes was the hoverboard/vehicle system. Now I'm the kinda guy who prefers using a gamepad when it comes to vehicles since the deadzone and all but the controls were clunky at beast when it told me for my first dungeon was a time trial. honestly I would've had a better score running the way then using the board, and that's saying something.

👨‍👩 [AI/Difficulty]

The Ai are remarkably dull, most animals have just one sound clip so every animal has one repeatable sound file that just goes off whenever you get close to them think the cow horn you could flip upside down it make the noise then you flip it back over and do it again, just without the effort of flipping it after the sound is completed. Cow goes moo, sheep go baah, fox goes yip, chicken goes bawk, etc.

One of the other things is when I finally faced my first boss the sound effects for most of the enemies/boss were minimal if not non-existant. I had a stone golem come at me and alot of the times I was expecting generating sounds or some crashes, ya know actual weight to the boss I was facing but nope, just music and sword swings. And when I figured out that the pillars were a hint to the weakness it made the scary lvl 14 boss a kitten in my opinion where damage was getting a 5 - 10 I'd smack it's weakness and get 110, etc.

💻 [Artstyle]

One of the things the game sells is the art, but in many of my other games reviews looks don't sell a game. It mainly features the Zelda: BotW proudly in menu, combat, and menu prompts. But again this game tries to be too many things, and from the trailer like the game is fluffed up to the promise these things are accessible from the get go. Be anything, do anything. What it fails to tell you is you start out with nothing and have to earn everything with exploration of fast traveling to new islands and grinding. Here I thought we would be sailing boats to get to places but no it does you dirty and in that aspect you're better off picking up BotW and just playing that honestly.

🎧 [Music]

The music to me is a somber note, strong when fighting a boss but lackluster and peaceful and nearly absent during times of solace and exploration

🎬 [Synopsis]

You start off with no character, so you go into the character customization screen make a character to your preference and start up the game, the game has a cute opening of you pressing a button that starts off a doomsday device destroying the main menu world, mainly ""Earth"" and the gods have befitted giving humanity another chance. And, namely you, a chance of redemption and you have to proceed, nearly stark naked on a tutorial island. 

Where the first hour you will be spending time how to chop trees, smash rocks, making crude weapons and tools to fight bosses and attempting challenges on the island to earn favors from the gods who reside on those islands. Additionally using the ""Pillar of Ages"" to advance your building/crafting to a new age, think of it more like time passes, but instead of time actually passing and land development happening like it would be for; Dinosaur Age, Medieval age, Industrial Age, Modern Age.

But instead its just, ""Oh hey you know how to make cude weapons from sticks and stone to copper and iron swords and shields, bows, and iron arrows, but before you can make anything more advanced and progress to the next 'Age Tier' you gotta grind out more skills find seeds and learn how to grow wheat."" Not only that but the game rewards you with 3-4 star tools and weapons (Honestly, I was just wanting clothes for my character and not run around like a loon in bloomers) early on in the dungeons that quite frankly would be redundant for the fact that if you were looking for a challenge as far as a survival this game makes sure to handhold you through the entire process. 

Aside from making the entire game a tutorial of quests to progress, when you complete all the dungeons on the island and made your mark its time to make a portal of transportation to the next island where you will have a map open up of your island on a grid and you select the next tile over to pay to spawn in a new island to fast travel towards.

📋 [Conclusion]

This game is EA, so buy with that in mind. I came at this with the mindset of a replacement to ""Worlds Adrift"" where exploration and learning go hand in hand. (RIP Worlds Adrift) Which this game clearly does not do. A fantastic example for skill/crafting based learning without taking away from exploration of the story of the game would have to be hands down Conan Exiles.

There are many bugs still in the game and the mechanics are subliminal at best to give you somewhat an experience. I didn't have the money for this so I ran it on credit and honestly seeing the world map and making it fast travel, god I hate when loading screens/fast travel is implemented in sandbox games.

You'll be better off playing BotW till this game actually decides to hit 1.0 my guess is probably in 2030. But I can give them credit for making a game with the look of BotW and having every gimmick game in it. To me brass tax, it's all flavor no substance. But in all seriousness, I seriously had hopes of a sandbox clone based on its artstyle which does show in the game in multiple ways, but like many hopes and dreams, this is but a fever dream.",1600494683,1601055542,False,1,1,0.496580004692077637,0,True,False,True,76561198072363841,921,32,116,0,116,1600491003

50,76355677,english,"In my eyes, I can see this game reaching for the stars. There is just SO much potential in this one game. For something this early in development, I'm quite impressed. A hybrid of Legend of Zelda BoTW mobility and combat with resource gathering and management along the lines of Ark or RUST, I've been having a good amount of fun. There is a bit much to go over so I will just state some of the basic stuff for now.
    Currently, the game does feel a bit clunky control wise. Most of it is manageable however the vehicles are just a bit too uncomfortable in their current state for me to use. Building is also a bit rough and takes a bit to get used to, but does have potential. Resource gathering and crafting is very similar to RUST or Ark, once you get enough resources to do so, creating multiple of the same station to process materials speeds up things greatly. The ""Age Progression"" system seems well thought out (so far) and is a good gating mechanic for players to explore and experiment with the new items.
     Some big issues I have found is that inventory management (being someone with minor OCD this is important) is in a rough state. Items can have ""prefixes"" to them based on how they where obtained. Ores, stone, wood, everything can have one. And once processed it doesn't go away. This makes storage a pain sometimes. If the devs see this, one big thing I would say is remove this mechanic for everything that isn't equipment such as weapons or armour. 
     But of course this game is still in an open BETA (at least that's what I think it is XD) and much should change before the official release. For those who are looking for solid game play and a lot to do, I would recommend waiting for the official release, when things are ironed out. If you want to help give input on the development or just see how things are coming along, I would recommend this game. Just remember that it's in early release so expect bugs and something to go horribly wrong at one point or another :) Recommended 7/10",1600732717,1601051184,True,1,0,0.509803950786590576,0,True,False,True,76561198120374453,157,3,584,217,435,1601487325

Now the dungeons, at the beginning it was fun since i was expecting something a little different but no same layout and same boss just with a higher lvl each time.

78,75460337,english,"I'm making this post because I'm salty but don't let that take away from the fact that I have the playtime I have. 

I don't care that this game is in Early Access, I feel lied to first and foremost by the screenshots and trailer. Craftopia's Devs could teach a class on how to pull the wool over everyone's eyes. Adding building assets that should have been in the game during in-company Alpha development weeks and weeks after release and simultaneously withholding environment, gear, items and landscape assets that were perfectly ready to be used to hype the game up for sales but not for real gameplay post access.

 I farmed some Best in Slot, I experienced 40+ Islands between three characters, I've had two level 50s, deleted one because there is no slate resets, and leveled a whole other one. I worked out three metabuilds within the class I play. I created an infinite-loop breeder engine with two-level ramping that belt feeds an already sustainable infinite animal spawner with even more animals, so if I want, I can farm infinite amounts of leather in no time. I perfected a few routes for the every-player on low level islands to minimize the time spent farming Crimson Iron. I popularized the Iron Golem distance reset farm for Ancient Veteran ore. I never got too in to agriculture because Merchants make cooking a proper joke but I know of ways to make a little over 1,000,000 of Gold every 60-seconds using multi-stacked plantations and 8X-Peach-Planting. I do not struggle to clear entire Islands without taking anything more than fall damage, I just go and go and go and I don't even really put effort into not getting a hit, it just happens, easily. 

You might have read all this and gone ""Okay cool long post about you spittling on your own peenor, now what's the point?"" The point is, I did all that in 150 hours. I did all that lackluster content in 150 hours and I can't even point out more than a handful of moments that were enjoyable. There were zero moments that were impressive, the closest anything in Craftopia came to impressive was that they let me farm 8,000 Crimson, 8,000, Ancient Veteran, 8,000 Freezing Iron, and some 20,000 Giraffe leather without any of my 500 Chestpieces I crafted having the four stats I was forging for.

The crafting process and farming itself were both awful experiences. Go 3 shot that dragon, 
then reset. Go 1 shot that Golem, then distance ~200 yards to force a respawn. Go sit next to that Freezing Iron node, wait while it's excavated and then hit those Giraffes 2,000 times while you wait. Alt+Left Click your Crimson Iron 7 times, Ancient 7 times and Freezing 6 times. Put it in a Automated-Crafting table with 20 leather. Make a Chestpiece, fail it, Alt+Left Click your items another 20 times, insert 7/7/6 Ingots manually again, do that 500+ times. If you don't manually organize the stacks the game has no way of knowing which Ingots to eat from, so if you put three different stacks of 100 in, it'll eat all 100 of the left-most stack of Ingots and only produce gear with One Ingot stat from the left-most ingots and a Leather stat. You're forced to sit and Alt+Click for maybe hours.

Thank God though, thank God this game has its boring, tedious, under-stimulating auto-farming and glitchy mob duping that drops your $3500 rig to 40 Frames, because otherwise I'd have to farm 3 Giraffes at a time maximum, move 200 yards, farm a pile of 2, go back to the previous pile, maybe only find 2 or 1 and I'd have kept doing that 20,000 times, because they drop one leather each. Thank God for the bosses that drop the needed Ores being next to one-shottable, otherwise the 30 Crimson and 40 Veteran Ancient they dropped would never add up to the amounts you'll need to tackle making a best in slot item(Again ~500 Attempts). It took me 23 minutes to farm 100 leather by hand using no bugs after I had optimized my route and gotten into the swing of it. I would have farmed for 76 hours just to accumulate the leather I needed to have failed as much as I have in this game on some items. That's not including real life, bathrooms, eating, sleeping or other necessary farming let alone just trying to have a fun sandbox experience at some point.

Mobs are incredibly boring. Their attack patterns are simple and quickly learned, they run at you real fast then take 4 seconds to animate before they try an attack, the only difficulty is fabricated with high mob damage. If you're dumb enough to get hit in this game you deserve to get one shot IMO, but that's just because combat is generally a rickety predictable mess. You won't find difficulty here, if you even find a fight, as most mobs don't respond to getting attacked, some do, but some also just break into sprint until they hit a wall.

They are however working on adding building materials and variations mostly right now. They recently did a combat and EXP update where they increased mob damage and EXP given on kill. They talk about tons of stuff they have planned in those tool-tips where they plead and beg for more time. They're obviously working on something but in my opinion, which is just an opinion, not the most important issues staring down Craftopia right now.

Vehicles handle like shit, their speed is comparable to getting good at Dodge Roll Spams while using Stamina potions, and they're just annoying to craft. Personally I'd have preferred them being 500-1000 Batteries to craft, but staying permanently. I don't want another thing that's just as fast as Tumble, but makes me carry it around, handles like shit and makes me go back to my base to craft it every 15 minutes after I've burned a couple. Vehicles could have been cool but they're just a gimmicky time-sink.

Combat flat out needs expert help. This has less abilities than a MOBA with some builds. Most builds run TWO variations of enrage. Isn't that fun. Right now the trees aren't even organized right. Tumble Vitality Meditation Double Jump and pretty much everything else that directly affects combat in Basic needs to go to Trick, and Trick needs to have all of its stuff like Chaotic Development and the other non-combat shit moved to Basic, Basic needs to be a tree with its own skill-points because it would be all farming, lifestyle, and building related. Skills with 6-Tiers need to be reduced to three tiers for the sake of producing fluid combat symbiosis between the Skill Trees. This is the most limited sandbox I've ever touched, and I don't care if I sound inflated and full of myself for saying this, I'm totally willing to help with this side for free. I'd re-vamp this whole games four Skill Trees for free if they would let me and I'm 100% positive I'd do it better than anyone on Development.

The biggest and loudest ""fuck you"" to everyone who wanted this game to be good is the screenshots, trailers and teasers that got us all hard. The game isn't optimized already, whats another 10 frames at this point in lieu of better looking zones. Give me the Enchanted Forest biome, give me the yellow grass plains, give me the better deserts, the stone ruins filled with skeletons and the lava that doesn't look like Air-Heads taffy laid down the side of the Volcano. I want the tree, rock and mountain assets from the screenshots, who cares if they aren't done, this whole game wasn't done or ready for us to see. I'm sick of getting 6 dupes of every Island. What happens when they finally release new ones? Is my fully developed World with 7 bases 3 farm Islands and one Skate Island obsolete, do we have to make a new World? Do we just start seeing those Islands as new unlocks as we discover new Islands post-update? Is every Island just waiting for a graphical overhaul?

7,76451114,english,"i like the game, i really, really do. i love the leveling system, the weapon variety (more on that in a sec), the animals, the crafting system and even the durability system. 
at its core the game is beautiful and well thought out. the beautiful skeleton is there but that is all. 
we can start with the leveling. you don't need to adhere to one skill or weapon, you're free to invest your levels into anything you want. you have individual trees that you can add to or pull from without restarting your whole game. additionally there are buffs you can get to your base stats with slabs that you get from dungeons. 
navigating the island and the dungeons with a single weapon is a breeze thanks to the very simple durability system! you don't need to carry around materials or a workbench like ARK or other games, you can repair anywhere with nothing but money which takes up no inventory space! nice. 
now, i've gone through 20 dungeons at this point (across various islands) to get slabs and they are ALL exactly the same down to the mobs that spawn and the boss, the only difference being the level of the enemies which is entirely broken. 
at level 25 i was able to defeat enemies well into the 50s.. so what's the point of grinding up the levels if every enemy is not only the same but also made of paper?
wellllll there is no point. after you advance a bit from the beginning there's no new crafting recipes or machines to build. you're just kinda stuck being a god that can't die unless you step in a campfire which happens to do more damage than any enemy encountered in the game lol
at this point i started trying a myriad of weapons i had accumulated maybe to lower the dps a bit and try something new, but wait.. every single weapon in a weapon class has the exact same move set. oof. i was so excited to see some of my favorite Dark Souls weapons in the game but entirely disappointed when it finally came to try them out. there's no variety in this game. it hides it so well. the first hours are great, i will give it that, but beyond that there is really nothing there.

In CONCLUSION
if you are looking for a polished experience, do NOT buy the game yet. wait to see how it evolves and if it is worth 25 dollars to you. right now it is the furthest thing from a well running game and has a lot of optimization left to do. (2070 super on only 1080p averages 40 fps)

personally i had the cash to spare and can deal with the shortcomings until some more updates arise, but probably won't play again until the game makes some changes since playing with friends is near impossible without port forwarding & playing tech support with your friends is a pain in the ass.

Even as little as I've played I've determined that in my opinion, of course, this game has great potential.  For the most part it's pretty fun running around gathering, killing low level animals and many of the other aspects including some of the crafting.  Where I have reservations and hold back on giving this a complete 5 star review is that there are some issues with some aspects of the game.  I hope these things will be worked out since it's early access... 

Building is a chore because the way the placement works as it is now, it's difficult at best.  it's hard to see where you're going to place an item and there is no indicator for where you're pointing.  putting up walls and/or removing them is iffy at best.    

The camera, is a little bit of a problem right now too.  there is no zoom, there is no first person view toggle or anything.  you can rotate your camera with the mouse but cannot zoom in to see things up close.  this becomes a problem the most as I've seen when placing items inside a building that has a roof.  without being able to zoom in up close you'll find sometimes the roof or even walls can obscure the few in such a way you can't see where you're placing items.

- GLIDER
- Local play is very good.
- No connection interruptions.


Cons:
- Attacks are too short
- When you repeat an attack, it takes a lot of time until the player can attack again.
- Singleplayer is not a good concept for open world RPG, the game tried to be too much like a AAA Game and its not working.
- No options to throw items from inventory
- Too repetitive loot dropping

also, as of now, there are over 200 possible worlds to discover which sounds great - altho they usually end up looking pretty similar after a while cause they aren't generated by random chance. would be nicer tho if that would be implemented.

the graphics reminds of zelda - breath of wind so it's comic'ish but in a good way. the music in the background is very nice but the animal sounds are somewhat terrible sometimes. 

what I would like to see improved upon is the KI it usually acts very random and illogical. also, each orc, stone golem acts pretty much the same.

36,76412246,english,"so ive played this game for a bit with my boys. and we enjoyed the first 3 hours, and im not even joking on the time. we have constantly tried to come back to this game with every update hoping something more enjoyable comes but its just really buggy and awful in its current state. the game play is very laggy and clunky in a multiplayer setting, the monsters you fight have insane mechanics. dont believe me? go 1v1 a buffalo and tell me how fun that combat system is. it might be a great game later but currently right now it makes me cry for what a game i thought it was going to be.

my number one favorite thing is that monsters and resources will constantly respawn even if you place down structures. for example, my base is huge and i built it over a large area that i thought looked like it had good scenery. now my house is covered in ore and trees that i have to farm out 24/7 if i want it to look pleasing. but the best part is that animals respawn too, and they spawn under my base so while i run around and craft i hear autistic foxs making love under my base. only way to make a base is a sky base and im not into that.

the thing that makes me cry the most is the 4 hours i spent making a base a huge base for my friends for fun, and i started to understand how the farming works in this game even though the system is dog shit. over 100+ wheat farms with saw boys and tornado sucky boys to grab my wheat onto a belt. AND GUESS WHAT HAPPENED NEXT. a random ass buffalo spawned in my base and started rampaging all over my base so me and my friends tried to kill it, but somehow it wound up lighting my base on fire. we grabbed water buckets to try and put it out but then it spread to us lighting us on fire which lit more of my base on fire which spread even more...... that base i spent hours on, yeah its literally gone with one buffalo rampaging and somehow lighting my base on fire. so i quit and now im here writing this review about how bad this game is.",1600836387,1600836387,False,3,4,0.515475809574127197,0,True,False,True,76561198027425726,63,2,920,0,920,1600835800

Pros:
Quite enjoyable
Variety of things to do
not too difficult
colourful
some interesting customisation options

Cons:
Bit of a lack of variety in enemies and locales, and what your character can wear
Durability and hunger drop too quickly
Lack of/poor explanation on some things

The trailer was fantastic, something that I had been waiting for in a new game ever since ARK. It had all aspects and more that I wanted for my next MMO that I could play endlessly for the next few years. I honestly thought this game was a solution to my problems of finding all other survival, crafting, MMOs boring and could never hold a flame to ARK.
However, experiencing what I had now, I'm more concerned this is a pretty shell that is empty inside being sold to the highest, gullible bidder. 
- The Multiplayer Does Not Work. - I tried for almost the whole hour I played to get this to work. This is the biggest feature that I must have in a game to play it and I assumed by the screenshots and the clips that multiplayer, or at least Co-op, would be available at this time. It is not.
- Settings, characters, and worlds Only Save Sometimes - I'm not new to losing progress, or having my settings messed up upon relaunching. But, after the 5th time of creating my character only then did it decide to save that character. The worlds only load on single-player, and my settings finally saved the last time I loaded in.

I'm not new to alpha game issues. I've helped many creators test their games. The bugs and issues were not what turned me off to the game. That price, for a shell of what can take someone a day or two to make in Unity, makes me feel like this is a cash-grab game.

Pros and Cons below.

Im going to start off with I play in a group of 3 other players and we have been playing the multiplayer from day 1.  Of course launch was very very buggy however the Devs have been working extremely hard to fix crucial bugs which was shown with the amount of updates and huge fixes I have seen in even just a week.  I went from having 20 FPS (I have a decent computer but was hosting the multiplayer) to now being able to run max settings and a stable 30-40 FPS with still being host.  This is huge as even some AAA titles have major issues hosting and it is working flawlessly now. 

Pros:
Combat is amazing
Worlds are beautiful
Feels smooth
Multiplayer works well

Cons:
UI is alittle clunky but can get used to it
Inventory management and crafting is clunky but again I expect future updates to fix alot

Beautiful game so far, will be following close.

[h1] Update after reaching 100 hours in the game. (In underlined text) [/h1]

[u] My ratings stay the same. The crafting system could be more organized though and the building system has improved a bit, still needs more work. As for bugs, the developer team is very, very amazing at updating the game. So far we have been getting more than 3-5 updates a week and yes they do need breaks, so we can't expect an update every day or even every week sometimes. Each update usually adds new items to the game which is awesome. Mostly they are fixing bugs and optimizing the performance which they have optimized very much so far. My last words, I think this game will be even more amazing with each update. [/u]

Movement Controls [9/10]
(When gliding it uses up stamina very fast which doesn't make sense in my opinion)

Crafting System [10/10]

Fighting System [9/10] 
(Some attacks are hard to control, you may go flying past the creature)

Building System [8/10] 
(Could be improved with better placement of objects. Some of my stuff is ""floating"" above the ground when I place it)

One bug I noticed is that a bird flew down under the ground. Not sure why or where it went.

Also the tutorial NPC's in the beginning respawn after some time. Kind of cool, also kind of annoying. I feel that one of them should drop a ""tutorial book"" when you kill them and make it so they don't respawn.

One issue I had in the very, very beginning before going into my world was not being able to press ESC to open my settings and change the mouse sensitivity. It was pretty slow for me at first and I couldn't open the menu till I was on my island.

Not much else for me to say at this point. I'll probably make another review after I have played for a few hours.

It is still early acces, so you have to expect lots of bugs, broken enemy AI, low variety on everything etc. But that is normal and the developers patch and update the game daily! 
Great probs there. 

So I first go about the pros and cons and then add my suggestions on how to fix the cons.

*Pro:* 
- Everything in one
It has an exciting mix from BOTW, Sims, Fortnite, Minecraft and Pokemon. You may think that this sucks, but it all works together thanks to the simplistic artstyle and free gameplay! 

- Progression System
The ""Age Progression System"" is a great way to archive a linear progress and give the player new things every time to keep the game exciting! 

- The Map
There are 121 ""different"" Islands to explore and they are enormous! All together the map might be even bigger than BOTW! (At this point they only have 6 or 7 different Island templates, but I'm sure they add more very quickly) 

- Freedom
You have the freedom to do everything and become everything! You can fight as a warrior, mage, archer (and soon hopefully Pokemon Trainer). You can farm, build, explore, climb everything or just enjoy all your possibilities!
There are even a lot of really cool and unique skills, like air dash, werewolf, spin attack and so on! 

- Multiplayer
You can play this amazing game with your friends!!!


*Cons:*
- Bugs and clumsy controls
There are, like I said, still a lot of bugs, the AI is unfinished and the fighting System feels clumsy and you often miss your targets. This however changes rapidly! 

- Building
You can only build walls and stuff on a static raster like in fortnite. It's better than nothing, but it's pretty limiting your freedom...

- No need to explore
You don't need to explore more Islands to progress. You can just use the first few Islands to get to the last Age Revolution, get the best equip and every skill. That kinda disencourages you from exploring. 

- Weak enemies / too strong charakter
The enemies are really no challenge! you can be level 10 and easily defeat level 45 enemy bases without any problems. 
Mainly the strong spells (You get later) are WAY TO OP! You can use the Ice-Spikes and one shot a whole enemy camp with double your level! This really needs to be nerved! 

- No use for Pokemon
You can catch nearly every enemy, but right now you can only use them to fill your batteries. :( 


*My suggestions:* 

- Fighting
The fighting system feels clumsy, because you can't stop an attack-animation to dodge or parry an incoming strike. (Except for sneak or dodge roll) 
So I suggest that blocking stops the attack animation and is instant! 
Also you should make a parry and quickstep skill. 
(Parry at the right moment = no damage and knocks the enemy back a bit and quickstep should be similar to the witcher. Block + sprint fe. could make quick steps somewhere. Therefore you can dodge small attacks without performing a big ass dodge roll!) 
Also a skill to block with one sword would be nice! (Way weaker than a shield tho) 

Also nerv your charakter or buff the enemies please! 

- Building
You probably shouldn't go for a fortnite like building system, cause it's very off in the world and doesn't look very natural. 
Instead I recommend a building system similarly to ""Arc Survival"". 

- Pokemon
Please let us train and fight with our catches!!!

- Islands
The higher level Islands should have biomes, minerals, loot and enemies that the other islands don't have! Therefore it can be exciting to find new things and explore all the different islands! 
(Yeah I know this probably was the plan to begin with, but I say it just in case) 


All in all it's really fun to play around, but it is far from what the trailer lets you expect! 
I however have hope, that it becomes one of the greatest games of all times in a few months!

From Factorio, you can automate a lot. But not everything. Somethings still require player input. In fact, quite a few things. From power management to bioethanol production. The bot with spinning chainsaws is great but they could use some customization. Such as what to go after. The logistic system could use splitters to divert resources to multiple fabricators om the same line. 

From a Pokemon, you can catch any creature! But the system could really use a rebalancing. Some of these creatures like to knock over my structures and get stuck in the decor. Also when trying to create closed loop systems, they glitch out a LOT.

1. Highly repeated content including dungeon, monster, map structure. 
2. Visual effects in dungeon need to be improved a lot
3. Different monsters need to be implemented. I am talking 10x-50x. 
4. Different items need to be implemented. 
5. Awkward hit box and monster AI and physics. Some magic can push monster a thousand miles away
6. I highly recommend a way to massively destroy a constructed region for fast reset. Now it is very hard to rip construction piece by piece.

I was getting as low as 3 fps on certain maps and as high as 20 on others. I also promised that if they could make it possible for the game to be playable for myself, I would change my negative review. They have since added features that help regain much of the lost fps I had, so as promised I offer a proper review of the game so far.

This game was first introduced to me through my friend who discovered it and shared it with me. Hankering for a new quality game, I decided to buy into it, and boy have I not been disappointed (for the most part). The game is incredibly dense and solid for an early access game, and there's a lot to do. 

Pros:
- Graphics and Music are very beautiful
- Combat is engaging and rewarding
- Lots of customization
- Large amounts of areas and regions to explore
- So many different things to craft
- Room for fun shenanigans
- Options for optimization (should you have a case of bad FPS
- Devs currently offering and pushing a solid stream of content as they push the game to an official release

Cons: (Honestly most of the cons are just things currently under maintenance)
- Enemies (and sometimes NPCs) suffer from ""Good AI"" and can sometimes stop altogether under very specific circumstances.
- Certain maps (like any map with a town for example) can drop your framerate like a brick. (This is still likely being worked out by the devs)
- Multiplayer is still in development (Jankiness, bugs, needs a VPN, etc)

This game takes what seems to be heavy inspiration from Breath of the Wild into it's artstyle and music to create a frontier survival game. Exploring the new lands, avoiding starving to death, having to fight local monsters, the occasional fireball from a dragon. Y'know, normal stuff. 

Jokes aside, I haven't been this interested in a game in a long time and I do enjoy everything the game has to offer and what is to come. The combat isn't 100% fluid but it is fast paced and engaging and in some cases forces you to take a step back and consider strategies. The maps are well designed as well, with the exception of a few that seems to be very heavy on framerates for some reason. (Ex: Maps with Towns, Dungeons, etc) Thankfully the devs have provided an expanded set of graphical options to help with the framerates being so low on specific occasions. I honestly just recommend playing the game for yourself simply because the devs have been pushing almost daily updates and there's so much to do.

After playing 11 hours, those are the things that I didn't like or I think they should be fixed or get better:
- Hunger and especially how often the character needs to eat
- Weapons quality drop on usage and durability. I would enjoy much the game if it didn't even exist.
- The boards durability is also bad in the point it makes them unusable. Thing of adding unbreakable items which don't loose durability.
- Repeating dungeons and drops in the dungeons which are only things for sale
- Bad stacking / grouping of the items when you put them in chests (for example you might need a checst only for different type of eggs)
- Monsters AI needs work
- In game maps also needs work


What I think could give more value to the game:
- Expandable inventory (until it's really - really big enough to carry everything you want)
- Treasure hunting / digging and hidden treasure maps

- The Minecraft aspect is fantastic.

- It certainly isn't open world.
- Too many stupid and unnecessary varieties of minerals. Let's say for example: ''iron''. You have: ''iron'', ''golem iron'' ''dry iron'' and the list goes on. At the end of the day it takes an extra chest space because it's ''dry'', and its ''dry'' enchantment has no value.
- RPG element sucks at the moment. Mobs hit like flies who collide with you and they're extremely slow. (May change in the future)
- Vehicles are a slippery sliding mess. Managed to drop everything into the sea or river because it's impossible to control them, which then makes them explode.
- Fucking Mono's 
- Not much variety. Every dungeon is a copy-paste, every area is a copy paste, every mob/dungeon boss is a copy paste, etc. It's been 16 days since it's release though.

It is not a complete game yet there are still a lot of things coming, just from 8 hours of game time I can see the potential here is large. It really does seem to have an aspect of every game genre in it. Exploration is fun and the survival element is not anything to hardcore. There are dungeons and Time trials to complete for rewards. Resource gathering can be cleverly intricate with automated systems and/or simple minded with manual labor either way is sufficient. The combat feels a little clunky at times with a weird camera and action targeting system, I like the action target but when you attack you move with the attack and are forced to move in a single direction which can put you in weird spots during combat. So far the only viable source of combat is a sword and shield, the bow is there but is no good with no skills yet(they are coming soon). I have seen they plan to add Guns, Staffs, and more skills on to the already present weapons. 

Ultimately, later when complete- this game will have a lot of variety and playability.

Biggest issue is the multiplayer (still early access though). You are forced to go to the same area as your teammates and that really affects you as the individual. If you wanted to stay behind in on a map and work on a building while the others go explore and hunt you basically are at a loss as you are forced to go with them to each independent map.

85,76065437,english,"So in real honesty, it's a very good game. It definitely has potential for what it is, and what it shows as well. However, the reason i'm not recommending this game right now is because it still needs a lot of work. It's still in early access so obviously there still going to be a lot of problems. Also the price range is not really worth it right now so it's best that you wait for a sale on this game or till it's out early access. Now so far, problems I've seen that they need to improve are, Npc's/Mobs, Animations/skills, progressions, dungeons, and for being a fan of making places like towns/villages, the building aspect of this game needs work too.       Let's talk about the Npc's/mobs. The Npc's don't seem to do much but just sell you things, upgrade your stats, or tell you how to do a mini-game in a dungeon. You can kill them but, that's all there is to it. They just die and don't even fight back. Drop barely items that they weren't even selling or don't even have either. Especially the bandit that has the name of robber in it, but actually doesn't rob you at all. Nor fight back when you try to kill him. (Anubis also gives you a lot of exp for him just being low level which shouldn't be possible since your like, 20+ higher then him. His drops are also bad too so why bother killing him or even kill Npc's for that matter) Just not much to Npc's really. Not a lot of interactions to them but just basic Npc stuff. Then there's the mobs, mainly the hostile ones like the orcs, or the wolves, or the dragons, etc. (Anything that kills you basically. I'm not going to include the passive mobs like the sheep or cows. Because they aren't really the problem.)  The pathing they have is a little wonky. Sometimes they are able to actually be there and hit you. Other times they just run into walls and get stuck. That and they lose aggro for some reason. So it gets a bit dull when you fight them. Also their level scaling doesn't feel like their level at all. There are some mobs that do scale in some way, but most of them just don't feel like they do. Even if they are higher level than you. For instance, Orcs from what I've seen can't do more then aprox 1 damage. Even if they are 20+ higher then you are. That includes other mobs as well like wolves and some lizard warriors. Their damage is just barely anything. And that's around like, you being 15 to 20+ lvls with just 30 in defense or 60. Even their health. They don't feel any tanky at all either. You can still kill them no problem which is no fun. And then, there's Dragons. I guess they are meant to be strong like mini boss in a sense, but i feel they are waaaay too strong. Infact, stronger then dungeon bosses. They do have average damage of 70-80 with normal basic attack and wind tornado skill they do. However, one of their other skill which is the fireball is quite overpowered. A single shot can do up to 400+ and it does scale in level to go higher damage which just one shots you. I get one fire ball, but it shoots 3 instead. That's excessive. Other then that, they do gotta fix up the mobs. They are out of wack from where they should be in levels.    The next is Animation which is obviously not good. So i'm not really going to go too hard on it since it is early access after all. But I will say It's just clunky and, snappy, and not polished. The orcs definitely needs help. They just stand there and like, move there head and just do a roar animation. It's not intimidating at all. Just goofy. And it feels like they do that animation way too much. That and some of the skills needs fixing as well. Magics especially. They don't look appealing. They just feel underrated. And some of the melee skills are janky as well. Some skills look good, some don't. Also, there are some skills that need nerfs/changes. That includes the healing magic. Its too low of a cooldown. That or it heals too much for how less mana it cost. Needs to be longer cooldown if it heals 80 in 4 or 5 sec. Or lower healing instead. feels too cheesy with the skill.  Now the progression. Basically the Age civilization thing. It feels too fast. For how much hours I put into this game, You can about get all of the ages upgraded in one day. Makes running out of things to do quicker since you got everything so fast. They need to slow it down so the game can be played longer on each civilization instead of rushing each one so quick not learning what each ones are for. Also the machine technical stuff should be at a later age that isn't to easy to get to at such early of the game. My opinion though so if it doesn't bother you, then don't mind me on this system. It just feels things are going way too fast and the automation is too early so I had to just say something about the progression.      The dungeons however are, Yikes! At least to what i've been through. All the dungeons feel the same, the layout, the boss, the mobs, all feel the same. Nothing individually unique sadly. And then there's some dungeons that are like minigames. Which the minigames just feels strange to be a dungeon to begin with. Again, that's my opinion. The dungeons just feels completely boring. Nothing new for each one you access to. I just hope they add more diversity to it to make dungeons more interesting then they are now. Also add more bosses as well.         Now the building aspect of this game. It's not bad. And it's not perfect. The problems i see and it's probably also my own personal opinion on some of it as well is, the clipping of the grass when you place floors, The 90 degree snap rotation, (Basically unable to freely rotate it around 360. This only applies to wooden floors/walls though. Other things that have a physic drop placement like the chest/crafting bench can rotate by your direction.) and the buildings/other things like automated furnace and conveyor belts clipping through the ground/ or floating in air. Basically there is no ground placement for them which sucks a lot and kills it for me when i'm trying to find a good flat building spot. That or try to work with slopes that is tough as heck to work with. Also, they need to work a bit on making it easier to select which object you wanna pick back up. Makes it hard if you wanna try to pick back up your misplaced chest to only accidentally pick up your wooden floor, making the chest fall down due to physics/gravity.        Again, it's early access so all this can change in a couple months or so. And for what it is and where its at, It feels it can be a really good game. So if you wanna try it, go ahead. But do expect what's above. Again, better to buy it when it's on sale. (I don't recommend it where it's at, but don't let me stop you from buying :D) (The map all needs to be different. Rolling on the same maps are boring and kills the fun of exploring. If 121 maps were different, people would have a reason to keep discovering new islands. As of right now, nothing special or unique.)",1600258839,1600505747,False,2,0,0.481481492519378662,0,True,False,True,76561198054102846,244,2,3163,63,2303,1602065382

90,76210832,english,"Pros:
- A lot of crafting with more to come. 
- It pulls inspiration from a lot of good games. (The looks of Zelda BoTW, world selection from Terraria, skill system similar to Ark/ able to tame creatures, automation is Satisfactory esque.)
- Character building. Different skill trees to go through
- Multiplayer will likely be a big deal when it is stable

Cons:
- It is very imbalanced right now. I tried magic and you can kill almost anything instantly with lightning bolt if you focus skill points in it. 
- Enemy/NPC AI is very lacking. Enemies just run around until it realizes it should be attacking you. 
- Durability kind of sucks and doesn't make a lot of sense in its current state. 
- Movement and combat feels clunky and controls could use some work. (Did not try on controller or see if that was an option. )
- It's earl access and feels like it. 

Overall I feel like the game has so much potential. I intend to play it a lot more and explore later options. I wish the progression was a little bit slower. I got to the 3rd age in my 2 hours played. There isn't much to explore right now, but it seem like the devs will be adding much more content and I look forward to it. 

As to whether you should buy it. If you like optimizing, and just making money/enjoy games with no particular goal in mind then you will enjoy it. There is a lot going on here and is going to require a lot of work to polish it to a level that feels right.

1,76205360,english,"Summary: Craftopia is currently an enjoyable survival/RPG hybrid game and, despite many missing or placeholder elements, is a playable and enjoyable experience that I recommend you purchase provided you're willing to shoulder the typical risks associated with purchasing an early access title. 

If you're interested in seeing a little gameplay or the contents of this review in video format I made a video to showcase the game which can be found here: https://youtu.be/zC54909FxnI

Gameplay: Craftopia is a Survival game with a smattering of different genres thrown in. You can fight monsters and explore dungeons while leveling up and progressing your character by means of several skill trees, you can grow crops and catch monsters as a farmer, you can build structures in a manner similar to the building found in games like Ark or Conan: Exiles as well as construct prefabricated historical monuments like pyramids or Parthenon, and you can automate many of the gathering processes with machines and conveyor belts in a manner reminiscent of factory builders like Satisfactory. None of these features have the level of polish that I would like to eventually see but all of them manage to be enjoyable, which is impressive given the sheer scope of the game. You can play multiplayer with minimal hassle and, while there are definitely performance issues and bugs related to that component, it is still a playable and satisfying experience. 

Graphics/Sound: Graphically the game is quite pretty and is stylized in a manner similar to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. There are clothing/character/combat physics in place that give the game a dynamic and attractive aesthetic. Likewise the music, though nothing special IMO, is done in a manner similar to Breath of the Wild and is pleasant to listen to. As of this review many sound effects are either missing or placeholder and there is no voice acting at this time, if you're an audiophile there may not be anything impressive here but the content present manages to be enjoyable.

Critique: I would like to see the features of the game continue to be expanded upon and refined further, to my knowledge the development studio is aware of the flaws and is actively working to correct bugs and give players additional content. This studio, despite being (as far as I can tell) an unknown development team, has done a phenomenal job with handling this as an early access title and demonstrate what should be the standard for early access titles. Communication with consumers is an integral part of an early access game, failure to post updates and additional content inevitably leaves buyers feeling as though they've been ripped off and their money absconded with by a shoddy developer. Not only has Pocket Pair been in constant communication with consumers, they have posted bug fixes and additional content almost every single day since release. This practice is extremely commendable and is one of the primary reasons I feel relatively comfortable recommending this title despite missing content and periodic bugs, it is my hope that Pocket Pair doesn't burn out and continues to keep the community apprised of the development process.

Conclusion: I played about 15 hours of Craftopia on release in multiplayer with my wife and another couple hours in single player to look at some of the updated content. I enjoyed the experience and, though much content is placeholder and/or lacking in refinement, I think most who enjoy survival or RPG games will find Craftopia fun. If this game caught your eye and you've taken the time to read all this then I feel you're probably safe to purchase, though as always you're safest withholding your money until the game leaves development as what is present here is very much WIP.",1600490426,1600490426,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True,76561198052274320,363,5,1059,0,1059,1600382611

   Just an update to my original review.
   The Devs are hard at work with constant updates and the quality of life improvements to the game show in both performance and functionality.  Still, there are many issues to be fixed and ironed out and to be fair this is to be expected this early in the development process.
   I think one of my biggest gripes right now would have to be the animations of both the player character and especially the creatures/animals.  Most of them are very clunky and not fluid enough or just ""unnatural"" in how entities move about.  The skeletons are a good example of this along with the bears and several others.  I like how there are so many animations made for the player character but many of them feel/look too forced and unnatural.  I wish the player movement had a little more gusto to.  I'm looking at this little lady character swing a sword and am thinking ""Swing it like you mean it!"", because it looks like she is clubbing things with her sword vs swinging the sword like she means to remove a head or two.  I'm not asking for blood and guts here, just saying if I were up against a creeping, albeit slow, skeleton dude and I had a sword in hand I would do my best to make it perfectly clear I'm not there to be best buds.

   One of the most annoying things has to do with the building system, particularly removing items or structures within an already crowded group.  You hold ""E"" to remove something and put it back in your inventory.  The problem lies in the game's inability to aim properly for the item you are wanting to target.  You can put your cursor right over the item of interest and it still removes the floor tile you happen to be standing on which in turn sends you plummeting to your doom if you don't have a glider equipped (which you should because why not?  Plus they are just loads of fun at high altitudes....until you run out of stamina}.

    Progression through the ages is also very unintuitive.  You can't make proper clothes and armor until much later than necessary.  Some items and technologies exist much sooner than they need to be and things like that.  Basically progression is not gradual but very sporadic in nature, and again it kind of breaks the immersion.

   The skill tree is awesome!  When you look over how many skills can be learned and how things are categorized it looks great!  The descriptions need some help, but other than that the available skill sets are spot on.

   Graphically I'm still very torn and I understand the Devs are not as concerned with this part of the game right now as they are focusing much of their attention on fixing bugs and optimizing the game and introducing small amounts of content, which is great and how I think it should be this early in the development process.  BUT, I still hope they put a great effort in this aspect of the game when the time comes.  In some ways the game is beautiful and almost perfect for the graphic style, but it's just not consistent.  A lot of the creature models lack any real depth and are just so plain it almost hurts.  The world of Craftopia is a beautiful one and the player models are pretty good for what it is.  I think something that takes away from the game world as a whole is that the shadows do not render on structures you place.  So, for example, if you place 4-6 tiles of ""Stone Floor"" like I did, then you walk from the grass to the floor you just placed your shadow disappears as soon as you walk onto the stone.

Original One Hour Review Below: 
  
 So let me first say that this game has tons of potential.  I'm not sure if I yet want to give it a thumbs down for the simple fact that the potential for a great game is there and it so far shows that the developers want it to be.   If done correctly this could be a favorite for single and multiplayer fun for a long time to come.  My biggest concern so far is that it is a very ambitious project with lots of irons in the fire so to speak.  There is a lot going on but none of it has a measurable amount of polish.  Keep in mind I am considering the fact that this is an early access title.

  First off the game introduces you with a very mediocre user interface that reminds me very much of the Ark Survival interface.  Very bland, flat, and uninspired.  Immediately you go into character creation which was short and to the point with various presets to choose from for sex, skin color, face shape, hair and hair color with tattoos and scars to be implemented at a later time.  The models are cool for what they are, however if it wasn't for the chosen art style they would be lacking much.

   Speaking of the art style, it works okay.  You can tell the game is heavily inspired by Zelda Breath of the Wilds and it shares that same graphic design with cell shading being the primary look.  With that though the characters lack graphical depth and fidelity and it makes for an overly cartoony experience for the eyes.  Me personally, I think it would look far better had they committed to going closer to the manga route like the Sword Art Online or God Eater series at minimum or better yet Dragon's Dogma type art style.  I really hope they add some depth and shading to the game though.  Some shadows and volume or something to bring the world to life.

   The story starts out with you, the player character destroying the world and not remembering why so you are commissioned with setting out and starting another one.  Now so far one of my biggest issues with the game is the translation to English.  The grammar and verb usage is terrible in many places and it makes it hard to follow and understand what's going on and what to do, but not impossible.  You see this very much when you wake up on a dock with a long line of people on either side that are there to explain the mechanics of the game and provide simple tutorials.  It's very much broken here.

   You start off with minimal clothes and there is no explanation as to how you go about crafting anything else.  Basic resources are easy to come by that being wood and stone and a couple others and you can almost immediately being crafting things.  You start out on a very small island with a few dungeons to explore and you see much of the same thing.  I really hope they introduce biomes where there are only certain creatures in certain places because right now you have an abundance of cows and chickens walking around with foxes, deer, BEARS, and Pokemon looking things called Mono all in the same area and it kind of breaks the atmospherics in the game.  It's just weird.

   Animations are decent.  Not great, but way better than many I've seen.  The AI needs help as far as the skeleton creatures go.  They either run in circles or run at you or into a wall, swing, and then run again.

   One of my favorite things so far are the number of mechanics available in the game.  This is easily the coolest attribute of the game.  You can jump swing, crouch, run, dodge (a skill that apparently has to be learned??), climb trees, CLING TO WALLS, attack on the ground, attack in the air (and yes there is an animation for it, not just the same animation used on the ground), if you have a glider you can glide through the air, regular attacks, and power attacks.  The list of craftable items is long which is awesome and apparently the list is getting much longer.  If they deliver on the vehicle implementation that would be icing on an already very large cake.

   The developers say the game will be in early access at least for a year if not longer.  I hope that they don't get burned out and drop support of the project.  If they stick to it the game could be spectacular.  The reason I even say this is because, again, there is so much that could be done with this game which means there is a lot of work to be done.  If this is just a side project, it won't come to fruition.  It's going to take a lot of time and effort to get this right, but if they do it will be epic.",1599235893,1600480146,False,100,7,0.63289564847946167,0,True,False,True,76561198218865609,273,23,525,40,60,1601089107

It is very obviously an early access game, with the single player mode having the bare bones exposed in a very tester environment kind of way. Many of the features are in the works and are labeled as such without shame. They make no allusions towards being anything other than a work in progress and yet I found myself enjoying it anyways.

I like crafting and survival games in general so I may be biased, but I found myself quite pleased with almost everything the game had to offer. The crafting progression doesn't feel too bad, though in the single player environment it did feel like everything was a bit close together, considering the state of the game it's more of a testing environment anyways. The graphics are lovely, the sounds are charming, and everything poops all over the place. Pink poopoo.

My only gripes have to do with character movement and the AI pathing. Movement feels a bit stiff, constantly coming to dead stops instead of a smooth deceleration is a bit jarring, but nothing that can't be polished out when things are more complete later down the road. AI pathing is a bit of a problem with bears running up sheer cliffs but I'm expecting something like that to be worked out along the way as well.

57,76109340,english,"Craftopia is like a teenage relationship. It's fun, it's exciting, you get an overwhelming feeling of anxiety when apart. Yet, it's also immature and prone to missteps ultimately leading to frustration.

As of the time of this review what you're getting with Craftopia is jack of all trades master of none experience. You've got exploration (albeit on limited sized islands). You've got dungeons and rpg elements (albeit simple dungeons and imbalanced skills). You've got base building (albeit with limited options and janky placement). You've got automation (albeit still needing a lot of hand holding and hit or miss success).

I think you get the idea and this runs through nearly all elements of the game, an initial WOW factor and then just under the surface the deficiencies become apparent.So why the positive review? Well of course this is Early Access and you do have a solid foundation here to build a game upon. While the entry price is high for an Early Access title in this state I, personally, weighed up the risk of the game never achieving its goals (and that is entirely possible given the small dev team) with the fact that the only way it can have the possibility to achieve the goals is to be adequately funded.

As such, while I recommend this, I do so warning all potential buyers that you must accept you're taking a big gamble. You'll get some fun out of the game as it stands right now but it's not complete and frankly may never be the game it deserves to be. The choice is yours and in this case you really are making that risky choice to participate in the Early Access development.

It's also probably worth noting that FPS in the game's current state is pretty poor even with a 1080TI in my system I've seen it drop to 15fps at times and rarely get above 40fps. This is made worse once you start building and laying down automation.

- 5- Same Multiplayer problem, when go to other island, it'll break the connect, also the host can't move or do anything, close game is only option
- 6- The big pot put it on the hill it'll glitch into the floor and *poof* it's gone
- 7- not sure is Multiplayer, but the generator somehow charge a bit, it reset a whole process
There must be more, I promise other can find it

2.Item need more organized
i just hate there's Bunch same stuff, many as hell and filling with whole chest, can't even stack them, you can ONLY pick one.... just one or half, why can't we stack the same item in chest but in our inventory can, also can we pick up more then ONE item not half.

3.Mobs
some mob are too Easy to kill, some are not, but I think most of it are too easy (Except Dragon), AI system still buggy
need to buff some mob but not too strong, Dragon might need some nerf, also Dragon they can burn in Lava, me and my friend can easily lure the Dragon in Lava pit watch him burn, mob combat system is also lame.

4.Chat
not too much, can we have hide chat buttom?

5.Building
It just how Triggered me that some building is floating on top of grass, i might had OCD, but hell, why the F the building system so Lame Lazy and copy F0tn1tE whatever that poop it is.

I can say it all days

just jump into my Conclusion
- Bug need to fix
- mob need to improve
- item system need more organized
- building need more logically and this is not Fooenite
it's not complete game so I gave a try, i'm not saying it's bad games ""Yet""
if they can improve more, this game well be good, but not the best.

78,76141638,english,"this game has alot of potential, but it's unpolished and glitchy from time to time which hampers the experience, probably not worth the price at the moment but i still found enjoyment.

pros:

+ delightful art style reminiscent of Zelda: Breath of the Wild (from which this game clearly draws inspiration)
+ gliding as a movement option from virtually the beginning of the game feels almost as amazing as it did in BoTW
+ audio visual effects from combat are punchy and satisfying
+ crafting is very extensive, with many new improvements and new items gained through ""ages""

neutrals:

-+ resource gathering and crafting progress fairly quickly
-+ world map is divided between smaller islands. not a big open world

cons:

- combat feels janky at times, and things like 2h weapons are not fun to use
- enemy ai seems unfocused and seem to meander around like the wildlife until you get close, when their behaviour will change to ""slightly more aggressive"".
- localisation is terrible, but this mainly affects flavour text. the tutorials at least are somewhat coherent (inb4 japanese indie team).
- because development is quick (at least to the age before the industrial one), it's not always clear how you ended up with additional crafting options. is it leveling? age up? world heritage site? not exactly clear through gameplay.
- lots of glitches right now, for instance sometimes buckets will randomly not appear back in your inventory after you use them (if this is a feature, i don't know why it is one, it likely isn't)
- vehicles like the motorbike will need a bit of tuning before they become fun to use, right now they are 1. too unwieldy to properly control and 2. honestly too fast and for the small areas you will likely unlock them in. they also break too fast and too easily to be enjoyed (motorbike will usually break after 10 minutes of use if you first try to ride it with all the things you will bump into)

15,76114888,english,"So I bought this game about a week ago and feel I have enough play time right now to give it a fair review.The game is worth buying but with the expectation it's a time sink and nothing more.  Let me repeat that - the game is worth buying if you are bored and looking for something to pass the time that isn't going to stress you out.There is no end game per se, just a lot of mindless running around. Once you figure out you only need to do Fergus Smith Gacha Peaches, you will have all the gold/items/hp you need to explore tier 7 islands with little concern. You can acquire the only ""end game"" weapon at tier 1 on repeat, which will be necessary since repairing your stuff does more damage than good. Getting 12 star weapons is incredibly easy (no killing required) as well as diamond picks, which will allow you to mine diamond and obsidian ore. You can also acquire an inventory full of palladium and adamantite ore and ingots through other means also quite easily.[h1]What I love:[/h1][list][*]Creating obscenely stupid contraptions that make you wonder who needs therapy more - you for the outcome or the devs for giving you the mechanics to do it. [*]There is no chance of raging. The closest I came was dying from getting stuck in a rock during an inopportune time and losing 6.5M gold which wasn't even an audible sigh when it happened.[*]I keep finding new things to do even though I have opened every map square and explored the few variations available at this time. [*]The devs are putting out a steady stream of updates daily.[/list][h1]What I hate:[/h1][list][*]Feces. Just no. And the fact it looks like a strawberry swirl ice cream is slightly disturbing. Although, I can say I have double scoop of dragon poop.[*]You can't build on the land. There is a cute little village on one of the maps that I thought I would call home since it had 3 wheat fields already going. Unfortunately, it's not that easy and I ended up saving myself the headache trying to make it work and just built platforms off the ground. There needs to be large areas of flat ground. The rolling hills are pretty but useless.[*]I don't understand the crafting. I love complex crafting and this is relatively complex in a game that doesn't - and shouldn't require it. It seems like you can mix and match different elements with a chance of getting some, all or none of them on the final product.

36,76097443,english,"[h1]As a base game, Id say this has PLENTY of room to grow. AS it stands it needs far more content and some more work on its bugs. Its literally a open world crafting, building and rpg style ""breath of the wild"" inspired game. HOWEVER it has some areas it needs to expand on.[/h1][list] [*]The story is kinda basic.. thats right theres a story. You literally start the game by pressing a big red button and destroying EVERYTHING. Beyond that point its up to you to build back up through the ages leaving it kinda... well up to you. [*]It has about 5 types of dungeons, between combat, target shooting, knocking a ball in a hole, racing to the finish line and climbing. Each map you play tends to have around 3 of these dungeons inside to which give you 5 chests and a ability card that you can trade to ""anubis"" to increase your abilities up to 20 times between your 3 main stats. But you'll see these 5 types over and over again since they simply get repeated at random and after 20 upgrades... your only purpose MAY be loot to sell.. but theres far easier ways to just make money.[*]Speaking of money, its easy to make money in this game, so progressing gets expensive eventually and even to reset your skill points if you mess up costs 100 thousand gold. However you can just as easily make a factory of infinite gears or other items from a ore vain and just sit there cashing them in every 10 minutes.. money itself just feels like a gate keeper rather than having any real purpose. Oh there are merchants.. but their items tend to be 3 times the value and never really have anything worth buying.[*]EVERYTHING HAS DURABILITY! Yeap Just like breath of the wild your weapons and tools will break but unlike botw, you can repair you stuff for money, each repair though lowers its MAX durability at a seemingly random amount. There are NO skills or bonus effects to increase this durability and since some items can only be looted, you'll eventually have to give up your favorite weapon or tool.[*]Building is done on a grid based ONLY. So you cant really do much outside of placing platforms where it will allow you to and working from there. However, finding a good flat enough spot to build gets kinda iffy most of the time as the ground tends to curve. However, you can build a platform out to sea and just make something there. Which I reccomend that or building in the air as depending on your location, ""Random"" lizard men, bears and other enemies will just poof into existance near your location and start to beat on your door if not just out right spawn in your house.[*]The animal farming is.. BAD. You have to first fight a enemy/animal and get its health low, then you have to throw a pokeball... er prism at the thing and PRAY that it first of all activates and even works on the creature. Ive had SO many of these things bounce off the face of a animal over and over again. You cant pick them back up and you cant reuse them so its just wasted materials. Meanwhile even if it does activate the animal can still break free just like in pokemon. But once captured the animal is yours... as long as you NEVER throw it back out cause the ball it was in disappears meaning you can never just call it back in. You have to go through the capture process again for your own creature. Meanwhile Farming the animals in this game just flat out kills them. Be it making milk, electricity or breeding them. Everything kills them.[*]AS it stands theres only 2 bosses and you'll kinda get tired of seeing them but grinding dungeons tends to be the best way to get over powered loot in some cases, in others you can see where they need to balance things out since there are some lv10 items that have worse stats than a lv6.[*]All in all, play this game with FRIENDS. The multiplayer is a bit jank right now, but it REALLY needs it. With over 100 maps to unlock in a single play through ""Sadly alot of the `100 are just the same 5-6 maps repeated"" you'll grow your power to level up and take on higher level enemies. [*]I'd say this games biggest weakness right now however is its lack of variety as you'll see the same enemies and animals in every single area outside of specialized ones like the dragon, elephant and crocodile. The same repeating islands, same repeating dungeons. Sure there are things like rockets, bikes, hoverboards and other things to increase the games item count, but you'll more than likely never use them due to the fact that they break just from use. The Game just needs More to do in general.[/list]At 25 dollars its cheaper than any AAA game you can come across and at the same time, Ive spent 26 hours in game so far with a friend just galavanting, killing and gathering. Thats got to say the games doing SOMETHING right when most 60 dollar games are over and done with after less than 10 hours.

They need to remove the ability for other players to cause flinching on other players when attacking in a close proximity.

99,76051505,english,"for early access this game has got a pretty decent amount of content. It was just released at the beginning of September, and appears to be receiving updates nearly every single day. I do recommend this title, however if you are iffy about spending 25$ for any game, for any reason I will say that it may not be for you at this current time. and if you must have a proper functioning multiplayer, then I would also say that you might want to wait.Gameplay wise, this game has a decent amount as far as variety goes. After some time with the game you might begin to feel that the different features that it provides might feel lackluster in terms of how certain things function. (As in there is no polish to it.) But that might be expected since it is an early access title. I play some single player and the game is definitely a good time waster with a few high points in terms of what you might discover on your first play through. But the game definitely shines brighter when you play with friends. (if you can get it to work.)Now I HAVE to talk about the multiplayer because the devs do not joke when they say that the multiplayer feature is still a wip. you can connect by using an ip address if the host knows how to port forward, or you can use the steam friend button, which essentially allows you to join your friends game through steam. The only problem with that method is that from what I can gather from this small new community is that it does not work. I even tried it multiple times with different network configs and it would not function. seems to me that the only easy way is to use hamachi which is a free third party app that syncs computers over the internet in like a LAN style network... In game when you actually managed to play with friends the experience was pretty good considering how unstable the multiplayer can be at times. My friend and I had to restart our clients once, but after that it worked like a charm. mechanics wise you and all the players on the server can only be on one island altogether. you cannot split up and explore islands separately which can be annoying if you and your friend have to do certain things in separate areas.All in all so far this experience is not bad for what is offered, some would even consider that the game already offers a lot.

To get things started:
-The stamina system sucks, I have upgraded my max stamina twice and still run out in like 3 feet.
-The durability on items is a little excessive. I understand wanting to make things more ""realistic"" but a real sword doesn't break after like 20 swings. It also makes building things like the helicopter feel like a waste of materials.
-I personally don't like having to travel to the different islands. I feel like this game would work beautifully if it was just one large world or continuously randomly generated like Minecraft. The inclusion of the multiple vehicles is pointless dues to how small the islands actually are.
+I enjoy the feeling of progression, but it is easy to just quickly spam forward, and reach a point where progressing feels pointless.
+I love the combination of the rpg mechanics with ""survival"" and crafting.
+The automation of things flows pretty nicely, honestly was really happy to find out the autodrills didn't have durability, probably would have quit if that was the case.

For example, I have a stack of 50 iron, and when I attempt to put it in storage it first puts a stack of 35, then 17, then 1, etc. which fills the storage unit extremely fast. Second, make storage in the game larger in general (I know you can craft bigger but the size change is minimal so far). Third, the combat is a bit underwhelming, the skills are not very smooth or accurate. And lastly, using stamina for your glider makes no sense.

Beautiful environments.
Nice graphics, very cell shaded like Zelda BOTW.
Combat is great.
The music is absolutely phenomenal.
Easy to learn controls and also can be played with controller.
The game is a bargain right now, I would imagine this price will only be the case whilst in Beta.

Cons -
(Bugs)
Sometimes you randomly lose inventory or placing down a workbench etc can immediately disappear for some reason, I would consider this so minor as the game is in beta.
There needs to be a better way to take back walls placed up, I found myself trying to move my mouse a lot and re position my character so much just to take back a piece of a wooden wall for my house.
Dungeons feel very uninspired and copy and paste, the only difference is the enemy levels and amount of enemies.
Some animations feel very bland, eg. Heal spell animation, looks like a mobile game animation.

Verdict -
These cons are so minor and will no doubt get fixed in due time.

3. Mobs visual range is far to wide. The mobs seem to be able to see me through mountains, walls or floor. you name it and they will be there.

Some improvements that could be nice:
- Important: Ambient sounds PLEASE!, the game has BEAUTIFUL landscapes but no ambient sounds to make what you see feel alive. (some background interactive music and some wind sounds when you are flying would be a nice touch as addition to the formula).
- Necesary: Better enemy AI (some enemies act a little bit dull or get stuck sometimes), for example: the dragon got bugged against a wall just after attacking me at the god's temple, I had to use a bomb to set him free again. Also some skeletons felt like if they couldn't notice me in front of them, like no detection at all.
- Minor but will be important in the future: The camera is working wrong indoors, going through walls and ground, specially if the place is little.

Despite those negative points, I still find myself enjoying the game. I absolutely love the leveling framework they have established so far in the game and I look forward to what comes more.

39,75978885,english,"At this point in time I do not think it is worth getting. There is not nearly enough fun stuff to do and the progression between ages is quite awkward as far as what technologies are unlocked when.

Unfortunately I worry about where this game is going as well. Smashing games like Zelda: BOTW, Ark, Fortnite, and Pokemon together seems like the best of all the worlds, however they don't really combine into a cohesive design. Each of these games is good on their own and really nail their design decisions. For instance Pokemon with capture mechanics, Fortnite with the building, Zelda with movement, and Ark with survival. This game definitely took the mile wide approach right off the bat with all of these.

Before anyone goes and says ""bUt RaGe It'S EaRlY AcCeSs, DuhHhHhH!1!!11!"", my criticism is the direction. If you take a look at the bugs that are fixed in each update you can tell what is the focus during development. Developing 100 mechanics and spot-fixing every bug that gets found in each of them trends towards spaghetti code and spaghetti game design (Looking at you League of Legends). The game seems to be developed a mile wide so quickly that an _extremely_ large amount of the content is just underdeveloped. It is a very haphazard way to develop and design anything in the engineering world. While the premise and execution so far have been pretty neat, I really worry about the actual process and end-goal here. This really reminds me of a Korean MMO where it looks incredibly polished to lure you in and then just dies under its own expectations.

Pretty much everything is a good feature, but exists in an unusable state (building, loot drops, random modifiers, cooking, breeding). What is here already is impressive, no doubt, but I do NOT see this game progressing at the rate it needs to and with the design focus necessary to make a good, cohesive experience. For any aspiring developers or designers out there, my advice is to _focus_ very hard on what you are making and flesh things out one at a time. Building multiple systems on top of each other without any foresight into the way they'll interact is a harsh reality to face when they inevitably collapse. A little planning goes a long way.

It'll be nice to see this stuff on the game in the future
-Better movement of the player
-More body models
-Puzzles on the dungeons, its kinda of boring just to go and kill. the game its very grindy-like already.
-Emotes
-Sea Exploration and Diving on water to find chests and treasures on the ocean
-Caves, its very easy to find minerals and makes the game to easy, it'll be nice a little dificulty on exploreing caves, have a mistress to save on there and find minerals.
-More Sword models, it has already a decent amount of sword models but i dont feel like they are very diferent from each other.
-Two-Handed Swords are Friking enormus, itll be nice that they'll be a little more balanced and small.
-For big sword lovers, like me, to introduce Ultra Swords, to replace and make the Two-handed a smaller version and more balanced.
-Better movement, it brakes a lot the feeling to see the player runing like a chiken nerd.
-More Soundtraks, it get boring to listen all the same songs.
-better overall sounds: Animal sounds, attaking sounds, and all the actions, it feels lifeless and very standard MMORPG to play withous sound effects.

65,75965595,english,"Craftopia is a promising Early Access game which currently has a fair number of tools and machines to build. I'm looking forward to seeing this one finished but from this point it could go a number of ways, not all of them good.

The survival aspect of the game is extremely superficial. You have a satiation percentage which ticks down over time and various types of food bring it back up in different amounts. There's very little benefit to cooking anything other than hunks of meat. Some foods give you buffs to different stats but they're not noticeable. ""Hunting"" and the hack-and-slash mechanics may as well be combined because they operate the same way. You swing your sword at an enemy or an animal until it's dead and pick up what it drops. Pretty boring after a couple of minutes.

Likewise, mining in the early game involves finding a node and hitting it with your fists or a pickaxe to get ore and then smelting it. Once you use up these nodes you have to wait some time for them to respawn. It never becomes an issue as there are plenty lying around but, in my opinion, this is a pretty banal form of ""exploration"". There's never anything interesting to see.

At the end of the day, the game shines brightest when you're working up the tech tiers and building automated factories. Automation is what is going to separate this game from a lot of the chaff out there so I hope the developers put a lot more work into it. Right now there seems to be too much artificial grinding getting in the way of what makes the game fun: building.

PRO's
GRAPHICS - graphics are visually appealing and textures are done well. however there are some rough edges to smooth out with the water transparency, fluidity, and reflection.
Enemies - the enemies have above adequate hitboxes and critical points which is promising to see in the early stages. 
Creativity - i love crafting and this game really delivers on that aspect it seems that the sky is the limit on what you can do and that in its self is very promising. 
LOOT - loot in dungeons is worth the trouble trust me.
Creatures - there is a good amount of animals and creatures in this game so i look forward to the full release.

CON's
ENEMIES - i feel that some enemies are too easy and some of them are FAR too sensitive. an example of this would be the black bear in the island i started on would always seem to spawn near me and follow me after it detected my presence i could run up hills and climb and it seems it would teleport to me to kill me at level 1. however,  when i finally killed it and i got the hang of the mechanics i killed every thing in the dungeons including the boss too easily due to the predictability of movements and damage output of seemingly starting weapons. 


In summary I've enjoyed the game so far and will continue to stream it on twitch through its updates and development.  i look forward to the full release.",1600063237,1600063237,True,1,1,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,True,76561198326001008,52,2,226,0,142,1600103000

- Killing/Grinding XP
- Leveling/Choosing skills
- Cooking 
- Exploring
- Dungeons

I have experienced very minor bugs and not a single game crash. The only real con I would say right now is most (not all) of the enemies are not smart nor are they challenging; maybe it was designed that way just for the first enemies you meet early on.  Granted in the next zone I met a ""X"" (no spoilers) and I was one shotted. 

For $25 bucks it is definitely worth it right now at its current state. I just hope the developers keep working on this gem; fix the minor bugs and keep going.

It's the Minecraft I wanted since I played Breath of the Wild

Now for an actual in-depth review that does this game justice:

So I bought this on a whim just because the majority of it would have taken from the leftover funds I had from the Summer Steam sale and I will say I am very impressed and loving the game. Personally, I always wanted a game like Craftopia. A open-worldesque, multiplayer survival game with hack & slash combat in a cell-shaded stylized design. I can't wait to see what PocketPair has in store! 

[b]Stability and Available Content:[/b]

For an early access game, it was way more stable than I expected it to be not just on single player but even in the multiplayer, which they mark as being unstable. I played with a streamer I mod for and aside from the hiccup of figuring out we had to do by IP instead of via Steam (because it's not working yet) and loading in doing a crash, the rest of our time we saw no errors until we got to a desert based island. In single player, I did have some issues with another island so I assume that certain islands still need the work done. Also worthy of mention is that there was a lot more content and items implemented than I believed there would be.

System:

You've probably heard the words ""Breath of the Wild but with multiplayer' probably followed with ""rip-off"". So I'm going to discuss that a bit.

Yes, if you played Breath of the Wild (BoTW), things will feel and look familiar; the UI design, Having a glider, stamina system, etc. But really only two of those things (UI and glider) can be considered ""unique"" to BoTW (gliders have been in other games like Archeage). That said it does look like Craftopia treds a fine line at some points, but not anywhere near enough that it should be decried as a ""rip-off"" just because the devs were inspired by their favorite games. We gonna call every RPG with an ATB and class system a Final Fantasy rip-off? Are we also going to call Genshin Impact a BoTW rip-off because it's a cell-shaded, open-world game? The smart, and only, answer is no. And if your only comeback is ""but what if the elves look like Hylians?"" I need you to look up elf art because you clearly haven't seen any outside of Dungeons & Dragons.

[b]Improvements to be made on what's currently in the game (I assume most of these are on the table however):[/b]

1. There needs to be a lock-on system. With the game doing a hack and slash combat style, it would be less frustrating especially in regards to using magic. That said, the combat itself is fairly fine for now.

2. So far advancing to the next age, & also making the altars, is really easy, HOWEVER I am assuming that this is strictly for Early Access testing purposes and will probably change over time.

3. While I know this would require a massive overhaul; Equipment, Building, Materials, and Usable Items should be their own tabs rather than one tab separated into sections. My suggestion would be remove the missions tab and make it more of a journal given to you by the person the player first meets (the person I call ""Deer God Lady"").

4. The Wall Climbing doesn't have an animation so far it's just wall jumping
 
5. Not really an improvement, but I noticed that a lot of items are separated by the enemy they drop from. This is a very good system, but so far it doesn't seem like the differences really do much of anything right now.

6. So far building in this game hasn't really been a priority because there is nothing incentivizing you to actually build a base. No weather conditions, no powerful enemies at night, I'm not sure if there are future plans for this but so far just use your wood to build ramps to reach the floating platform Anubis is just chilling on. 

[b]Things that I enjoy about this game:[/b]

1. You can tell this is a project and labor of love. They wear their influences on their sleeve such as the animation for when you place an Altar of Transportation and Altar of Civilization

2. As I stated earlier everything is running pretty well & while I feel progression is made easy, it is nice to be able to try things and make sure they work. 

3. The game looks real beautiful and has damn good views. Like this game could really benefit from a photo mode to show off islands, but that's a minor want.

[b]Conclusion:[/b]

For me, it's $25 pretty well spent BUT I definitely recommend waiting on more updates or a sale. While I put in 10 hours, most of it so far was just exploration and setting up camp on the other islands. However, if you go on the site, watch the trailer, and  you can tell that the developers have more they want to implement in the game.",1600050132,1600050132,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True,76561198052365840,59,1,712,15,511,1600993328

It brings it's own splash of originality to the table and the game in its current state is packed full of content, with MUCH more to come in future updates. I literally bought a copy of this game for my friend just because I enjoy it so much and I wanted to share the joy! 

NOW FOR THE CONS: 
1. Multiplayer in it's current state is unstable, and not accessible without following a guide on how to set up a himachi VPN and inviting friends manually through that. This is only temporary, as future updates will bring multiplayer to the masses with ease of access. 

2. Also, there are some iffy inventory management issues.. for example; you can have 3 different types of iron ingots and each type takes up a slot in your inventory. This is the case with most items, leading to a nightmare when it comes to saving space in your inventory when farming and doing dungeons.

3. I've came across a couple glitches, none of them game breaking, but this is all to be expected during early access. 

TL;DR - this game has the most potential out of ANY early access game on steam, the developers are truly creating a unique experience in a genre blending open world, survival, crafting, rpg game. There is truly so much this game has left to offer, that even though a lot of content has yet to be released I would still recommend picking this game up in its current state. I can't wait to see what the developers do in future updates, 9/10.

[u] PROS [/u]
[list]
    [*]Beautiful art and design along with approximately 8 expansive maps to explore excluding the starter island.
    [*]You can set animals on fire.
    [*]Setting fire to trees gives you charcoal. This bypasses the step of having to cook logs in a fire to get charcoal. 
    [*]Some automation for processes are enabled like gathering wood and gathering rocks.
    [*]There is a lot of recipes for food. 
    [*]Tool and progression of unlocking equipment is interesting and easy to learn.
    [*]Sound quality.
    [*]User interface is smooth no staggering. 
    [*]A lot of new maps to explore via the teleportation gate. 
    [*]Varied options for skills and talents for different use like combat, magic, and gathering. 
    [*]Graphics user interface is easy to navigate. 
    [*]Devs are actively patching bugs that are brought up in the discussion board. Keep it up!
[/list]
[u] CONS [/u]
[list]
    [*]Generated maps repeat only with higher difficulty and no new ores/ unlimited ore sources to be found higher than silver.
    [*]Translation quality of dialogues and descriptions are rough around the edges .
    [*]Description for certain items does not reflect what the item does, or what the item is used for. Instead, a vague haiku is in place. 
    [*]Dungeon maps are repetitive and need more variety .
    [*]Recipes including seaweed and cocoa beans are included, but there is no way to get these items.
    [*]There are still unimplemented items such as the drying rack, and the loom that are available within the first 5 ages, but unusable.
    [*]There is no automated way to collect crops that have been chopped down by rotating saw. 
    [*]Instructions on usage of some equipment need to be improved (such as the large pot) .
    [*]There is only 4 total kinds of armor you can craft. 2 are leather, and 2 require metal but still a limited amount with very little stat value. 
    [*]Breeding: when you breed animals it seems that the spawn takes the level of the map or your level, and not its own level. For example: taking a level 42 and level 43 cow to the beginning island, when bred, gives me a level 5 cow and not a level 40 or so as one would expect. Breeding the same set of cows on a level 40+ map when I am level 25, will result in a level 25 cow.
[/list]

[h1] SUGGESTIONS [/h1]
[list]
    [*]Add a way to automatically gather crops into storage. Maybe a robot to collect and store into a container?
    [*]Add a way to automatically plant seeds on plantations. 
    [*]Have the ability to milk cows for a continuous source of milk.
    [*]Add a way to change gamemodes so you do not die as easily. Similar to minecraft's peaceful setting. 
    [*]Drop cooked meat when animals are set on fire. This would bypass cooking similar to minecraft and a good source of early, quick food options. 
    [*]Add more maps so that they do not repeat when you go into teleportation, maybe at a later stage in the development. 
    [*]Add more dungeon type maps maybe with puzzles. 
    [*]Add items that can be found underwater, which would include having the ability to dive. This could be where seaweed is found. 
    [*]Add the option to be able to dye equipment. This could be done by utilizing the herbs (red, yellow, and blue) to be able to craft other colors using the color wheel. 
    [*]Change the cactus to be like trees, or like the mushrooms in the swamp biome: drop more than 1 piece of cactus per plant. 
    [*]Add in different types of arrows that you can get as drops or crafting from different biomes: slow from frost biome, poison from swamp biome, fire arrows from volcano biome, piercing damage from desert biome. 
    [*]Have the option of upgrading chests instead of reorganizing everytime. 
    [*]Add a backpack as a wearable storage option. Start with leather for earlier stages, and eventually requiring different metals. 
[/list]

[h1] TIPS [/h1]
[spoiler] 
[list]
    [*]Gold: Easiest way I found personally, was selling the peach fruit. Once you have breed the seeds to the top 14 star tier, it gives you an excellent payday for very little work. Estimate for around 15 plots of peaches could generate you 6mil gold in 10 minutes sell time in the market.
    [*]Merchants: You can catch, and breed merchants and interact with each new bred baby. The level of the merchant corresponds to the items you can get. At level 40+ you can get diamond ingots even though you cannot utilize them yet. At level 5 they sell bird feathers, leather, and lower tier items. You also get exp from killing your spawns.At level 20 they sometimes give you the option to grab more monster prisms. 
    [*]Wheat farms: There are already youtube videos on how to set up automated wheat farms although it is still not an ideal compact solution. 
    [*]Hosting Table: It spawns a villager everytime the countdown goes down and gives you an egg. The egg has special buffs on it that will apply to you when cooked. It also augments food recipes that includes eggs in them. Thanks to Bell Cranel in the comments for this.

[i]  Even during development this game is tonnes of fun, definitely worth a try and the devs seem to be fixing bugs as they are being brought up in the discussion page.

20,75932038,english,"[b] Summary: [/b] This is all from a multiplayer POV, as it's one of the most appealing aspects of this game imo. Since it is still in development and is more unstable, I may have more a more negative outlook here. As a first impression, the game needs a lot of work. There are a lot of bugs and not much content to sink your teeth into, but the game does showcase what it wants to do well and can be very good through continuous updates (which it seems like the devs are doing a good job so far, so keep it up love you.) Overall I can still say I enjoyed what I've played through so far, and will continue to see what the devs do to make this game better. If I could give a ""meh"" I would, but I'd say anyone could find a lot of enjoyment in the currently available content. There are plenty of frustrations, though. So if you're on the fence, I'd say hold off until there's a sale going on.

[b] Pros [/b]
- Right out of the gate you can see they have a well-defined art style. It isn't harsh to look at, and if you're someone like me who gets nauseous due to graphics you don't need to worry about that.
- For the most part, everything is pretty intuitive and there weren't any moments where I was confused on what to do next. The progression feels natural and if you feel uncertain, there are missions that help you guide you.
- There is a good variety of content for different types of players. If you get bored killing things, you can try farming or fishing or crafting.
- UI is easy to understand and navigate
- The worlds are interesting to explore and have a weird variety of animals
- Character customization is always a plus for me. There isn't much variety, but I can be a cute anime girl so that's all I need really.
[b] Cons [/b]
- Unfortunately there are more cons than pros.
- There are quite a bit of bugs that can hinder progression slightly. i.e. crafting stations falling through the floor or generators endlessly failing to make a battery and not being able to retrieve them, thus you have to use more mats to make them again.
- The beast catching system is a great addition, but it's pretty unreliable. The pods you throw at them will sometimes bounce off or go through the animals.
- There are only 2 types of armor with 2 color variations each. I don't know if gear drops somewhere else, but I didn't see anything drop other than weapons
- Some crafting stations are available to craft, but then serve no purpose. 
- We entered about 10 dungeons. There are hoverboard races and normal dungeons. We only saw one map for each. I don't know if there are more, but it got very repetitive and boring. Plus the boss at the end did less damage than the mobs leading up to it.
- Literally after leaving the first island, we had map repeats. Explored five islands, three of which were the same map. I mention this because the reviews I saw mentioned only seeing this in higher level areas. This was not the case in my experience within multiplayer.
- Some of the enemies have no projection or animation for their attacks. They will just suddenly turn towards you and you've taken damage.
- The animations are pretty clunky, especially for magic. Some spells seem pretty pointless too, such as being able to make a bonfire from nothing. I didn't notice food having an expiration time and you can bring a lot of food with you so there isn't really a need for cooking on the go.
- The freaking Monos. I hate them. Granted, I ended up building a home base near some that spawn, but holy cow are they annoying. They knock over your stations portal gates, and pillars when they attack you, and float far af when you hit them back. It's a personal vendetta but I hate em.

[h1]The Lowdown[/h1]
Craftopia is, by all means, a good game. It's a mish-mash of several other games like Breath of the Wild, Portal Knights, Fortnite, among others. If you like any of these games, you may enjoy this. Collect resources, build some structures, and adventure your small, ever-growing world. Climb walls, glide, fight, farm and automate in some lush, vibrant lands. You can even build flying machines! They even work!

[h1]The Good[/h1]
- The game plays well and seems well optimized for most modern computers.
- The UI is relatively slick and intuitive.
- Lots of space for advancement, both for the player and their character, through specializations and nifty gadgets.
- The few tracks of music currently in game sound great. 

[h1]The Bad[/h1]
- The game is made by a small Japanese team, so many translations (currently) are done by machine, leading to some accidentally hilarious descriptions for items.
- Several items don't function properly (yet).
- Some structures fall through the ground, leading you to have to make more.
- Some desperately needed resources are finite. 
- Some of the animal sounds are odd or just cheaply recorded at home. Again, these will likely change in the future.

[h1]The Ugly[/h1]
While the cost of entry is a bit cumbersome for what's currently (alpha) available to do in game, the devs are actively bugfixing many of the issues, and constantly adding more features. This is good, and I can only hope they continue to improve the game daily, and not vanish like so many others. Still, early alpha means [b]buyer beware[/b].",1600035584,1600035584,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True,76561198025314962,26,3,651,0,478,1600221906

25,75930660,english,"All I can say is this game has a lot of potential, I've sunk 10 hours into it so far and have really enjoyed it.
There are many things that do need to be touched on however before it can get better.
1. The AI isn't the best, an example being the bears on the tutorial island next to the dungeons. It may be just an issue for me but each run I've done they just repeatedly run in circles occasionally breaking the loop to do a 1 dmg attack on me.
2. Damage tweaks, in some instances if you attack a creature while a resource is nearby (tree, rock, etc.) sometimes it will cause a much lower amount of damage to be applied to the creature, for example I specialized in two-handed weapons and attacked a chicken which would normally one shot it, however due to a rock being hit first it caused my attack to do much less damage. (Also some creatures will just do no damage sometimes, like hit with you a 1-6 dmg)
3. Attacking feels too clunky, especially with two-handed weapons, you can swing once and if you don't continue to swing it will put a timer on when you swing again, like you can swing once and if you stop you wont be able to swing again for like 3-4 seconds. Personally it doesn't suit me to have a system like this but the game is so early in development I can see why it's there.

And I have many more issues such as the motorcycle having little to no traction and bouncing all over the place and the helicopter being quite slow and unable to be flipped if it goes upside down, the game is very nice so far, from the BotW sprinting and gliding, to almost complete automation of certain tasks, this game can most certainly become a gem, it just needs time, and with how often the devs are patching the game I think it is well on its way to being a good game.",1600034536,1600034536,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True,76561198147357960,80,13,639,0,625,1600516701

41,75925989,english,"A very interesting blend of RPG / Survival / Sandbox / Factory Management. The developers clearly took a lot of inspiration from Breath of the Wild and the way that game approached its world and gameplay mechanics (ie. you as the player have to explore and discover the worlds' secrets, you are not pointed towards it). So far, it is looking very promising. Definitely a unique game, as I have never played anything quite like it. Progression feels very fluid and natural, and it is very satisfying to go from making basic, early game stuff like pickaxes and fishing rods to more advanced things like motorcycles and helicopters (yes this game has rideable motorcycles and helicopters). The art style is also incredibly captivating and makes the game a joy to look at.

It does, however, have a ton of bugs and garbage optimization (most of the time you'll be playing with very bad FPS) but the developers are incredibly active, patching the game almost every day and releasing significant content updates as well. The localization (the translation) is sadly rather atrocious, with some item descriptions making little to absolutely no sense (it feels like they legit ran some of this stuff through Google Translate and just copy-pasted it into the game).

The game does support Multiplayer, and it works surprisingly well (it didn't at launch but the devs have done a great job optimizing it to the point where it feels very playable). Do however keep in mind that the game does NOT (currently) have dedicated servers so you can only play with Steam friends and not randoms.

So far, I'd give the game a solid 7.5/10 with the potential of reaching a 9/10 or even a 10/10 if the devs keep supporting it and adding new content. I can personally guarantee that you'll at least get a solid 5-10 hours of enjoyment out of this game in its current state, most likely more if you enjoy the survival game loop.

96,75835251,english,"I wouldn't buy this game now, unless you want to invest in what is essentially a mix of BOTW and Fortnite with a in depth crafting system. This concept isn't bad, and I think that if this game gets polished, it could be really good, but in its current state, it is not worth the price point. It is extremely unoptimized and buggy, with lack of options for graphics/resolutions, and very bad animations/combat. There is promise here, and I'll keep the game hoping that the devs deliver on that promise.

Pros: 
-Graphics in places do look quite good
-In depth crafting system
-A skill tree that actually changes a lot about how your character functions
-Okay building for the most part - Fortnite building
-Not many restrictions on how you can build/where
-Lots of attacks/variations for combat
-BOTW glider and world design

Cons:
-Abilities don't scale well with weapon damage - the spinning attack does barely any damage compared to a normal attack
-Falling through world bug nearly softlocks you
-Perma death no respawn bug completely softlocks you from continuing to play your character
-No option to reset position/refresh game in anyway to get you out of game breaking bugs
-Building is really finicky, and never really puts a highlight where you want it to
-No option to move things similar to how you can in Fallout 4. Having the break an item and drag it to task bar, just to place it again is really annoying. 
-Extremely laggy, with 20-30 fps most of the time, no matter what resolution you are on
-Dungeons have awful stretched textures, and bring you down to 20 fps
-Repeating bosses w/ no diversity as of 4 hours in
-Enemies levels aren't always good representations of how hard they are
-Tutorial area needs to remove the NPCs and have text/arrows to guide you
-Animations/attacks don't combo well together, and feel disjointed 
-Too much time for timed dungeons. You can do the shooting range dungeon with a melee weapon
-Night time lighting is awful

The foundation it has can be a really good game if they continue to nurture it.

In it's current state if you're on the fence of buying the game heres who I think it'll appeal to:
If you like seeing early access grow over time
If you like making up neat bases
If you want to experiment with their automated systems you can build like robots for harvesting crops or wood.

As for my hopes:
The age system is interesting but you can get into ""high tech"" too quickly (it's like the 3rd or 4th upgrade), so I hope in the future it's more gradual and rewarding to get to the automation age.
The dungeon system is going to be expanded, so I'm hoping for a variety of different enviroments and challenges, for example atm each one is either a kill corridor or a escape puzzle.
Story currently is very just thrown in, you (as in the player character) legitimately nuke the world into nothing but islands and then a god says ""hey you destroyed the world a hundred years ago go rebuild it"". I'd much rather have a fantasy angle where it's all settlement and expansion. The story doesn't need to be upfront, especially in a sandbox game where you can make your own everything.

74,75847934,english,"รีวิวแบบเผินๆนะครับ เพราะพึ่งเล่นไปแค่ 4 ชั่วโมงแบบ singleplayer อย่างเดียวเลย multi ยังไม่ได้ลอง

เริ่มจากข้อดีก่อน
+โดยรวมที่เล่นมาตอนนี้เกมก็สนุกดีอยู่ ถ้าใครชอบแนว grinding คราฟของ ตีมอน open-world ปลดล็อคของใหม่ๆไปเรื่อยๆ ก็โอเคเลย content เกมในตอนนี้ก็เยอะอยู่พอสมควร เล่นได้เรื่อยๆอีกยาว

+ความอิสระในการเดินทาง ลูกเล่นต่างๆพวก ปีนกำแพง, glider, hoverboard, มอไซ, เครื่องบิน บลาๆถือว่าออกแบบมาได้ดี เวลาจะสำรวจแมพเลยรู้สึกไม่ค่อยน่าเบื่อเพราะมีออพชั่นเยอะดีนั่นแหละ

+ผู้พัฒนาปล่อยแพทแก้บัค/อัพเดทเกมมาทุกวัน ซึ่งเป็นเรื่องที่ดีครับแสดงว่าเกมยังอัพเดทอยู่เรื่อยๆ ก็ต้องค่อยๆ progress กันไปทีละนิดนั่นแหละครับ

---------------------

แต่ข้อเสียหลักๆในช่วงนี้เลยคือ
- Performance มันยังไม่ค่อยดี คอมผมก็ไม่ได้แรงมาก cpu: Amd Fx-8350 (โคตรเก่าละ), gpu: Gtx 1060 6gb, ram: 16gb เล่นแบบ 1080p เฟรมเรทตอนอยู่นอกดันแมพทั่วไปมันส่ายๆที่ 25-36 fps ซึ่งเกมมันก็ไม่ได้กินสเปคอะไรขนาดนั้น คงคิดว่าตอนนี้ยัง Optimize มาไม่ดีนั่นแหละครับ ก็รอดูอัพเดทต่อไป ส่วนตอนอยู่ในดันก็ 40-56 fps ลื่นๆ แต่ก็ไม่รู้เป็นไร มองถังไม้ในดันทีไรดรอปมา 25fps ทุกที 5555

- มอนสเตอร์กับ Active Hit box ของมันครับ ผมเป็นคนที่ชอบเกมสายตีมอนมากๆ แต่ตอนนี้คืออย่าง broken เลย ไม่ได้ถึงกับทำให้เล่นลำบากแต่มันน่าหงุดหงิดอะครับ ยกตัวอย่างก็ หมีดำของเกาะแรกเลย ท่างับกับตะปบ active hit box มันดีเลย์แปลกๆ คือแทนที่จะ parry ด้วยโล่ตอนที่มันงับพอดี ต้องกดก่อนที่มันจะงับประมาณเสี้ยววิถึงจะติด นั่นก็คือ ไอ้ active hit box มันดันติดตั้งแต่ก่อนหมีงับอะ ถ้าจะ parry นี่แทนที่จะดูด้วยตากลายเป็นต้องจำ timing เอาแทนว่าจะงับตอนไหน ละต้องกด parry ก่อนที่หมีจะออกท่างับถึงจะพอดี มันแปลกๆนั่นแหละ คือผมผ่านเกมพวก monhunt, darksouls, guildwars 2 บลาๆมามาก เลยซีเรียสกับเรื่อง i-frame timing กับ hit box สุดๆนั่นแหละ :v คือตอนนี้มัน broken เกิ๊น Melee Combat ช่วงนี้คือ ยืนตั้งโล่เฉยๆรับดาเมจละ kite ตีจนตายดีกว่า จะ parry นี่ ต้องแก้เรื่อง frames window กับ active hit box กันอีกยาว

+/- ธนู.. ไม่รู้จะคอมเม้นไรมากเพราะไม่ค่อยได้ใช้ แต่ที่รู้ๆคือถ้ายิงโดนหัว ตอนนี้ธนูคือ OP มากๆ แรงเกิ้น คงไม่ถึงกับเป็นข้อเสียแต่มันรู้สึก unbalance เฉยๆนั่นแหละถ้าปรับๆหน่อยก็น่าจะโอเคขึ้น

- สายเวทย์ ตอนนี้สกิลเวทย์คือ กรากมาก ดาเมจอย่างเบายังกะปืนฉีดน้ำ ท่าแรงๆก็มีอยู่แต่ติด animation นานเกิ๊น เรียกได้ว่ากดผิดจังหวะมีหน้าแหก แต่พวกสกิลสาย utility พวกฮีล ชุบ แคมป์ไฟฟรีก็โอเคอยู่ คือสายเวทย์มันรู้สึกแปลกๆอะตอนนี้ มันมีคทาของคลาสมันเองรึป่าวนั่นแหละ พึ่งเล่นไปจิ๊ดนึงเลยไปได้ดูว่ามีคราฟคทามั้ย ที่เห็นคือมีหมวกสายเวทย์ +matk อยู่ แต่เท่าที่ดูคือไม่ค่อยเห็นของ +matk เลยสงสัยว่าของ +matk มันมีอะไรอีกนอกจากหมวก คงรอดูอัพเดทต่อไปกับสายเวทย์ ในตอนนี้คือรู้สึกผิดหวังอะ 5555 คือมันขาด gimmick Magic Caster ไปมาก เหมือนเป็นแค่คลาส utility อัพสกิลมาเสริมเฉยๆละใช้ดาบโล่เหมียนเดิม

- ข้อเสียสุดท้ายละที่นึกออก คือเรื่องการสร้างสิ่งก่อสร้างต่างๆ มันยังไม่อิสระพอ คือมันไม่ได้วางตรงไหนก็ได้อะ มันมีล็อกของมันอยู่ เช่นแบบ จะสร้างบ้านให้มันหันองศาตรงๆ แต่มันหมุนองศาแบบอิสระไม่ได้เพราะมันมีล็อกของมันอยู่แล้ว ละคือทำไรไม่ได้ไง มันล็อกแบบนั้นอยู่ บ้านมันเลยธรรมด๊าธรรมดาแถมหันหน้าไม่ตรงตามที่ต้องการอีก มันก็เลยเป็นอีกเหตุผลที่ว่า เวลาเจอเกาะลอยฟ้าละจะสร้างทางขึ้นไปจากจุดที่ยืน แต่ไอที่ล็อกมันดันหันองศาไปคนละทางกับอิเกาะ เลยต้องเดินหามุมที่องศามันตรงเกาะก่อนถึงได้สร้างทางขึ้นไปได้นั่นแหละ เป็นอีกข้อเสียที่ ไม่ได้แย่มาก แต่ทำให้รู้สึก Tedious แทนที่จะวางตรงไหนก็ได้กลายเป็นต้องมาเดินหามุมวางแทน ก็รออัพเดทตรงนี้กันต่อไป

tl;dr 
Q: สรุปจะซื้อมาเล่นตอนนี้ดีไหม?
A: ซื้อมาลองก่อนครับ ไม่ถูกใจเล่นไม่เกิน 2 ชม. ยังคืนตังได้ เกมนี้ช่วงนี้มันอารมณ์ประมาณ Alpha test แบบพึ่งสร้างใหม่ๆยังก๊องๆแก๊งๆอยู่ บัคกระจาย performance ระเบิดตู้มต้าม แต่แต่... เกมมันเล่นสนุกจริงๆนะครับ มีอะไรให้ทำเยอะอยู่ ของคราฟบาน ถึงจะสร้างบ้านไม่อิสระมากแต่ถ้าจะสร้างก็ดูดวิญญาณอยู่ 555 ถ้าเกมยังอัพเดทอยู่เรื่อยๆ Craftopia ก็เป็นอีกเกมที่น่าจับตามองมากๆเลยล่ะครับ :v

6,75829718,english,"TLDR: If you're here because you want to support an indie game dev, buy this game. Otherwise, wishlist and hold off. 

Craftopia is a beautiful game that is lacking significant amounts of polish. The core gameplay loop is also poorly explained. It's very easy to not understand ""the next step"". The crafting system is pretty solid, and it's got a very ""fortnite"" feel. The games soundtrack is nice, soothing and generally well crafted. The in game audio is, in some places, good. And in others not (looking at you black bear). Speaking of black bear, enemies can apparently scale mountains when pursuing you, which is... Not fun. Additionally, more powerful enemies move much too fast until they randomly get stuck on some object and you can kill them. 

This game is very well thought out and you can see it when you open the various menus in game. There is quite a bit of potential here and I don't at all regret my purchase. But be warned, it's absolutely early access and it shows. Do not buy this expecting a polished, finished product.

- Combat with melee, ranged, magic with a diverse, rather unbalanced skill tree and questionable enemy AI movements.
- Find and gather resources (mining, fishing, deforestation).
- Ride vehicles that will explode in a few minutes.
- Farming 15+ types of crops but the only crop you care about are peaches.
- Cooking many types of food with questionable description texts.
- Capture NPCs with the monster prism thingy that bounces off randomly
- Automation with machines and conveyor belts which massacres the framerate 
- Repairing your gear every 10 minutes
- Unlock new map areas where you need to start building again

12,75813982,english,"TLDR; At its current state,  buy it only if you want to support the developers and report bugs.

Here we go again around the early access circus. The developers release a game that is poorly optimized, bug filled, and prone to crash at any point in time. But just like any politician, the developers promise so much for the game's future. Which leaves the consumer the choice of either waiting for a full release, or supporting the development team with buying and play-testing their product. Normally I would give this game a pass until it was closer to a full release. However given its success in Japan and the fact its being developed by a small team I thought I might as well roll the dice once again. I'm no stranger to paying for early access games, as some can become huge success stories (Deep Rock Galactic) and others completely dissolve into oblivion (Worlds Adrift). 

But for the few hours I have played it really seems they have a solid idea of what the game should be. What's unique here is instead of either copying a single, generic game style trope, (COD, battle royale, MMORPG, etc.) or trying to reinvent the wheel per-say. The team looked back at popular standalone titles in the past, researched the best parts about them, and made a game that tries to synergize them all like some kind of modpack. It's this ideology that is perhaps Craftopia's greatest strength, a game that has a little bit of something for everyone. 

Open world, sandbox, exploration, RPG elements, crafting, building, multiplayer. It's like minecraft-tekkit and breath of the wild had a baby. A small, writhing, undeveloped baby, but one that has potential for greatness. Will the people behind this game care and nurture their ugly duckling into a beautiful swan?

The performance is terrible, especially multiplayer at the moment. My friend and I were getting around 25fps and I have a decent computer. It's glitchy. The AI is dumb, the NPC's and dungeons are repetitive. It's horribly balanced (seriously the amount of damage over time to vehicles is insane). Also, the English translation, oh my God is it gloriously bad.

But despite all of that, it's still  the most fun I've had in a game, both SP and MP in a long time. There is an obvious diamond here even though it's very very rough. While it lacks diversity in content right now, with everything currently implemented, and some of the options we can't select just yet, it's very clear where the developers are going with this game.

For a game that tries to be a little bit of everything, it has its own personality. It takes all of the fun parts from the games I love, like factorio, satisfactory, 7 days to die, devil may cry, ark, conan exiles, and many others, but doesn't seem to have too many game play negatives yet.

You can cross breed species. ATM it doesn't produce much, but....
You can run dungeons with your friends.
You can tame animals by catching them like pokemon.
You can do tricks on hover boards.
Hang glide.
Fly helicopters, drive cars and bikes.
Mini-bosses and some areas contain ores with rare buffs so your encouraged to explore new islands and progress.
Base Building

There are definitely some things i'd like to see added in/changed. Character creation is somewhat lacking, but it looks like there's more options coming soon.

Additionally, unsure if this is a bug or an intended feature, but if one person in the world travels to a different island, it forces all players on the map to travel as well.

Can capture mobs with Monster Prisms and be a Master of all Pokemon!
Skills/skill tree help you with survival with anything from better cooking to zapping all enemies with lightning or fancy sword attacks with life steal.

Multiplayer works but of course has a lot of bugs too.

Update: 

So after a few days of playing around in this game I found that while you will ""run out"" of things to do for the most part, the devs are active and have been updating the game daily. Not just bug fixes or optimizations but actually adding things to the game on a daily basis!

Just in the last week we've seen several new structures and building options (in addition to all the bug fixes)

I play a lot of early access games, maybe I've been searching for something new or maybe I'm just a glutton for punishment in the form of constant issues. But I can say that the devs here really seem to care and are active with both the community and their creation.

The combat feels good, except aiming takes a bit getting used to. I haven't used a bow yet because I have been focusing on magic. Magic seems pretty strong in the early game, but I don't know how well it scales yet. There are a ton of bow and melee skills that I still need to try out.

Farming is alright. It's hard to automate with the bugs at the moment, but it is possible. I hope they add a hybrid grid system similar to how satisfactory does it. I am not hugely into the farming stuff but it seems to be going in a good direction.

The dungeons are very bland right now. The world is pretty and reminds me of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.

There's a lot of stuff to do, and it really provides a step-by-step progression system that ties in with quests. There is a grind but it doesn't feel bad. Quests reward you with skill points alongside leveling up.

The hoverboard is super fun, you can't pick it back up after putting it down though. It is annoying that I need to build one for every island.

Devs are very proactive on updating, almost everyday.
PROS:
-MMO/Adventure genre, kill or harvest to level up your character. Level up perks/skills to make your character stronger
-Automation production(Like satisfactory game) to make your life easier, mining ores for your or harvesting wheat automatically.
-Animal breeding, so you dont have to keep going out to hunt them. You can have a slaughter house for animals.
-Wide variety of weapons and skill build. There are more to come.
-Big maps/islands and there are 100+ map to travel to.
-Base building for your furnace/item productions.

CONS:
-Still poorly optimized, i have gtx 1070 and im runing 10~15 fps on 1080p high specs. There is no way to change graphics settings yet. It is a prebuilt of low res+low specs or high res+high specs.
-Repetitive atm, still need more updates.
-Need more bosses and weapons(in the future)
-Building is too hard atm because there is no snapping or changing modes on the placement. It is base on where you are looking it in order to snap it. So creativity is limited.

If you are interested in supporting the developers and have the expendable income, then by all means buy the game and take a look for yourself. However, for everyone else, this game is more a ""proof of concept"" than it is an actual game.

What I mean by ""proof of concept"" is that most of the features and aspects of the game are very primitive and rough with many issues that aren't necessarily bugs but are certainly proof of an incomplete game. The primary factor causing this right now is the animations and general control ""feel"" of the game. Controls feel unresponsive and unintuitive which is compounded by the janky and broken animations and physics. On top of that, the game would be far better suited to a infinite world instead of the current mini-islands that it uses. Of course something like that is a lot easier said than done, especially when using non-voxel graphics like this.

Some of it's a bit janky and needs more polish but that's what early access is, the fact that there's already a tone of content shows how much effort the devs are putting in.

My computer can very much handle this game but it has some major performance issues even turning down the resolution as much as the game allows me still has performance issues. The only place where the game ran fine was in a dungeon. So optimization should be the main focus on fixing at the moment in my opinion. I'm well aware that game specified about multiplayer being unstable so I won't make any comment on that since the developers do know about it other than that the game is great for what I was able to play before it crashed a few times and then I didn't want to play anymore since it takes about 10 minutes for me to finally get into the game to actually play because of the load times. The combat is actually quite nice since usually these ""crafting/building"" type games have very basic combat nothing to fancy.

Haven't gone to far into the crafting at the moment because of the reasons stated above so I have no opinion on that right now.

So if you are someone who is searching for a game like this and willing to invest in it's future, then go for it. Otherwise, wait for it to be out of Early Access and have more content.

The thing I appreciate most about this game is how candid the developers are about the state of the game.  They tell you upfront that there will be problems, there will be glitches, and you will have to restart your game a few times. This is entirely true. At one point I couldn't figure out if I was using a mechanic wrong or if I was running into a glitch. 

Despite this I have had an amazingly fun time engaging with the game. It feels like someone took Breath of the Wild and mixed in a bunch of Minecraft mods. And they are pretty open about that is the style of game they were going for. Everything could use a coat of polish or smoothing down some rough edges, obviously, but what is there feels engaging and fun. 

The game was developed by Japanese developers, and they note that most of the translations went through what was essentially google translate. It definitely shows at times. Luckily you can intuit your way through most of the dialogue or information sections.

All in all a fun game with a ton of room to grow. The developers seem like they are pretty on top of things with updates, and they fixed several bugs already. Definitely seems worth a grab.",1599768611,1599768611,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True,76561198127073683,71,2,543,0,371,1600322075

* Vehicles - The vehicles are fun but very difficult to steer. Make them a bit easier to maneuver.
* NPCs - The NPCs tend to walk into water some times, including monsters, and they apparently don't know how to swim so they end up dying. Improve on the basic AIs for NPCs.

Even though I said this game is janky, its many different mechanics make the game very interesting to go through and learn what each of them do. Although the game's progression seems long, I do not have a serious mindset which allows me to have fun with the mechanics.

i do not want to be negative here, on the contrary the game looks promising but for the time being it lacked lots of elements and was to easy to progress through out the ages. in 2 hours playtime i managed to achieve a lot which made the game a bit boring to me.
fighting mechanics lacks refinement, character movement lacks refinement, tall grass animation is a bit hypnotic since the whole grass animates at the same time which makes the grass seem to be moving. building stuff or floors in grass makes it not visible at all, i find that annoying since i cant see where i build already.
building needs more physics and logic, i could place floors in the are with no need of support or foundations.

- Is this game fun? Yes, it has brought a new spin on survival games by taking a lot of features of other survival games with the crafting and exploration and added it's own few touches to make it refreshing. You can easily poor hours upon hours into this game! 

   - Is this game worth the $23? In my opinion, If you have the expendable income and don't care than yes but, if you are more cautious with your money at the moment and are hesitant, than no. The reason for this is because:

  - The game has a lot of bugs, but just because this game is in Alpha and is only $23 does not excuse some of the things that are glaringly apparent and some down right game breaking. Glitches such as; if you travel from one area and back your progress and things that you have built disappear, Some objects are completely non functioning or can't be interacted with, If you position your character in the right spot in front of a tree, you can see straight through the entire map, and many more. 

  - The game runs poorly, Even with uncapped frames (I was playing on highest settings at 1080p with a Ryzen 7 3800x and a 2080 So your experience may vary dependent on your specs and settings) the game struggles to stay above 60 fps, even while doing the most minute things such as running. I even capped the frame rate with the in game option it provides and the game still could not hit that 60 fps mark consistently. No I did not test any other settings lower so of course the game could run better at lower settings, I would hope. 

 -  THE GAME IS MISSING MORE THAN 80% OF THE SOUNDS!! ENEMIES DO NOT HAVE SOUNDS, THE ENEMIES ATTACKS DON'T HAVE SOUNDS, YOUR ATTACKS DON'T HAVE SOUNDS, THE BOSSES DON'T HAVE SOUNDS, YOUR MOVEMENTS DON'T HAVE SOUNDS, YOUR GLIDER DOESN'T HAVE A SOUND, I have read a lot of the reviews for this game AND NO ONE IS MENTIONING THIS GLARING ERROR!! 

 - There are too many features that the trailer shows that are not in the actual game and if they are, they are extremely buggy!

 - The multiplayer damn near does not work the connection and ping are through the roof! (I have limited experience with this so again experiences may very.

   - Yes I have only a few hours played with this game, but if I have run into that many bugs and issues in such a short time, that should tell you something. I believe this game can be something great and for those who don't mind diving in and seeing what this game has to offer then go for it. On the other hand this game is very enticing but, it can not deliver on the full package just yet. If you are hesitant, just wait on it, better days are to come!

The features that they already have implemented for combat, character builds - leveling system, crafting, automation and open world exploration is a solid starting point. For combat although simple at the moment is complimented by the character build variety and leveling system, you've got different skill trees like for a warrior, mage, craftsman etc. the enchantment system is different too at least it's my first time encountering it. When you craft an armor for example, the origin of the materials you used to craft has a chance of enchanting the armor, so if you use leather from a wolf there's a chance of it having a ""wolf"" enchantment that give bonus atk and def, that's how I understand it works. The things you can craft depends on what ""age"" your technological level is and you can advance through the ages by offering certain requirements to a shrine, the shrine being an object you can build as well. The graphics are pretty good which makes exploration interesting too and you can craft objects to make exploration faster like a hover board or a motorcycle, I haven't discovered the others yet(I'm at the third? or maybe fourth? ""age""). It's still an early access title though so expect bugs and other features not being fully implemented yet. With that being said I recommend this game, it's everything I'm looking for in a game with the base features they have, I get bored easily but not with this game, I just finished Wasteland 3 and I can already tell this game will be occupying my time and attention more than Wasteland already even with it's current state.

First off just to give you an idea, there is 100+ different kinds of food to make. But yet I can't place or build things without it messing up.
The buildings rotate in 1/4 turns. So you can't have it face the way you would like.  They don't snap to the ground and you can't adjust the height of it ether. So the floors don't snap to the ground so you cant place them to make the ground lvl to then build on them.
The storage system is horrific. I have 1 box with 10 different types of the same thing. What does that mean? Well, I kill an animal it drops hide. Well this hide now has different types from the same animal. All with different stat or bonuses. Well that's all fine and dandy but they stack together in your inventory with in a sub stack. COOL. But now the chest I just build doesn't do this. They all stack separately. And that chest for some reason only has 6 slots. 6 slots? Its a chest!!!! So the stack of hides that I was holding in my inventory in sub stacks (4 in a sub stack(4 different kinds of hides)) now take up 4 slots. So now I have 20 chests just to empty my inventory.
The monsters love to deify gravity and do pop up out of no where. I was hiding in a spot that I was only able to get to by gliding into. So now I am thinking this will be great I can shoot them with my bow. Well Mr Bad guy just climbed up a straight wall and got me.
Nope I'm done I had to stop playing. I am working on a refund. I don't care I can make 100 different kind of food. And upgrading to the next lvl give me..... You guessed it more food to make.

I advanced 3 times in the game and there is actually not much to expect, except more cooking recipe that doesn't really serve anything in this game other than eating them and selling them(?).

Money can't really bring you anywhere with blacksmith and so i am looking forward on how they can make money system in the game grow bigger than just opening new maps.

Me and a friend where looking for some games to play and he found Craftopia, our first view of the game on the store page looked like a interresting zelda looking game with a lot of crafting and automation. When i started the game we kinda got sad that we couldnt launch a normal muliplayer game but ended using hamachi to be able to play in the end. then the fun started and i couldnt stop playing anymore.
I know this is basicly the same textures and engine as fornite (even that i cant stand that game) i love what craftopia is. 10 hours in i explored a lot of island got to the gold age and started making a cow farm, oh god that was a big mistake within 2 hours of time i had over 200+ cows running around and needed to go on a mass murder to get my base clean again. ended up placing a the big cooking pot under them so they get auto killed. now im here with a cow farm and automated iron/sand/copper farms. and im just in love with the game,

ofc this game got some problems. and here are a couple
the game runs mostly at low fps as it isnt perfeclty optimised (good thing is you dont really notice it to much)
there are some bugs that remove items you are crafting or making.
some bugs are just plain up trolling you and not allouw you to fix weapons or hit things

80,75698142,english,"Craftopia is an interesting game with a huge flaw. It is running on Unity. Well, at least that's what I think.

Craftopia is a kind of a mix of a lot of things. It is mostly a survival game in which you have to eat (but not drink nor sleep), it looks like Zelda: Breath of the Wild, you can glide and you can ""climb"" like in Z:BOTW, you can build things like in Fortnite, and then there's a little bit of japanese character action game when you have to fight: you can roll, you can parry, and you can also use magic. And there's also some other things, like a little bit of RPG sprinkled on the top. So, like I said it's a kind of mix, some kind of a giant milk shake.

So what do you do in Craftopia? You find yourself on an island, on which you have to gather things, to build things, in order to warp to some other island to do the same things you already did, but with a better equipement this time. And it's fun. The traversal is great in here, and you can also use some vehicles to go faster (only for a limited amount of time, at least for the first one), like an hoverboard for example.

I don't really think it's a bad game. And what I prefer in Craftopia are the fights. It's pretty rare to see good fights with tights mechanics in that kind of game. Although, I wouldn't dare to say that the fights here are excellent. In fact, I think the characters are a bit floaty and sometimes I find them unresponsive, like when I want to do a a 3 hit combos, but the game does a charge attack instead for example. So not too tight, but if you try not to spam to attack button, the game works mostly fine.

But like I said, it is using Unity. So what does that mean? It runs poorly and it lacks graphical options. Like most Unity games.

I don't know if there are greatly optimized Unity games. In my experience, I didn't encounter one. Maybe they exist, but most of the time, they are slow and taxing on the CPU. Or the GPU, I don't know. Will Craftopia be like that in one year? Two years? It's impossible for me to say. I want to believe that in maybe two years, this game will run fine but I can't be certain of that. And right now, that isn't the case.

Should you buy Craftopia? Why not. I think it's a fun game, it's rather beautiful, and the combats are rather good. Not excellent, just good. All in all, for me it's a positive experience, except when I look at the frame rate. My pc isn't a technological beast, but I only played two games with similar performances so far: Kenshi and No Man's Sky. And I should say that for No Man's Sky, it is only true on some rare occurences, and with some adjustments I can play it at 60 fps. But that's not the case for Craftopia.

Sadly, I have some positive and negative cons;;

Positive : Game is fun, the more options, the possibilities to be able to craft more and more items when you upgrade civilization. The RPG/MMORPG like of the game amaze me of how amazing it all works out together.

Negative : Due to the multiplayer not fully working I’m forced to host the server with “hamachi” due to this we’re limited with who we can play. I have a friend from EU and I’m from CA so it was impossible for her to play with me.
The optimization could be way better, I have quite a good computer and there random drop from
50-60 FPS to 20. 


Overall : Quite a funny experience so far, having a lot of fun with my friends but sadly cannot play with all of them as of now due to multiplayer limitations. Looking forward into the updates and can’t wait that it’s workable!

Just a few suggestions or requests:
-please introduce more diverse music for different regions and events.
-please allow different gear, I have already gotten close to 20 Knight swords, I sold most of them.
-please give more space in the chests, the inventory has more space than the chest, that just doesn't make sense.
-please include some way to regain the durability of gear, it can be through a weapon-smith NPC, or you can simply introduce that in the skill tree.

4,75687885,english,"REVIEW WRITTEN ON [u]9TH SEPTEMBER 2020[/u]
Take note : Currently in early access, and in my own opinion in the early alphas not beta

Many features are buggy or are not implemented yet, but as for now the dev team has been actively engaging in fixing and adding contents closely with players bug reports

The base game or core gameplay can be seen and played,

1.RPG leveling system plus skills options, allowing diverse play styles focusing different roles with different skill trees
2.Material collection and crafting, generic cut trees, mine stones/deposits, for crafting tables, resource boxes, walls or even vehicles(hoverboard, helicopter, a motorcycle) and etc
3.Capturing pets(currently unpolished mechanics, ie : how they follow you, attack a hostile, stay at point and etc)
4.Base management/building/farming, plan and build with your friends or by yourself (a bit wonky like how snapping objects works, currently being addressed by the devs)
5.A huge traverseable map , one map to another ,each sizes varies and the entities on island also varies
6.Dungeons , each island has portal(s) leading into dungeons with a boss and rewards boxes/chests
7.Existence of non-playable characters roaming around the world(currently I found interactable npc are just simple talks,simple tasks and merchants,probably have more?)

Major issues currently:

Multiplayer
Its bad as it requires players to host on their devices meaning, you might need learn how porting and receiving works along with the help from third party softwares such as hamachi or so on ( from where I live in SEA, my ISP sucks that's why), not sure if you need to if you live somewhere else

In the end, if you are a person that enjoys a little bit of the craft and adventure type game, you might wan to pick this up [b]later on[/b].

The multiplayer is a bit daunting and frustrating to deal with since some times, it doesn't want to work, but once that issue is solved, I can absolutely say that it is fun thus far. When more stuff is added and released, the game will only increase in play time and fun. The choice between archery, melee, or magic thus far is very nice. I would say that the magic area kinda needs a buff to make it more viable against the other forms of combat, but the regenerative aspect really sells the magic.

34,75681442,english,"Very ambitious title. It attempts features of many different genres which fits quite nicely in the world. The combat is hack and slash, I would consider it more akin to Zelda and a very light Dark Souls style in terms of fighting melee and bows. In its current state it isn't very solid, but it is still playable and fun. It can only get more tight as development progresses. 

Building is very early, it's basic floors, walls, ramps, etc; with different tiers of material types as you progress. Can easily be expanded on, but it is in very early development as far as the building goes.

Crafting is where the development is quite solid in terms of progressing tiers, making new/better items, food, weapons, etc. The automation crafting is very nice to see in a style of game like this, although depending on your playstyle, it almost doesn't feel necessary in my opinion. It can also help take the load off of farming, smelting, crafting, etc.

Overall it is a very good base for a game in early access, still playable, multiplayer has worked for me with Steam Friends Joining (must be lucky). As for the story, it's too early to tell how it will progress, as it starts with a clear lore direction, but nothing else is added. With how ambitious it is going to be filled with the features, I can only hope it doesn't fail to keep people interested and becomes strong in all features, rather than just having features just to say it's like every game in one.

I should also mention its kind of a figure it out for your self situation atm and or watch a youtube video. We felt real dumb after trying to use the PokePrisms for the first time. But if your a Survival game player you know this already.

Has potential and with some, ok, a alot of polish... I think it can be a Fun game for those who are like anime and survival games. I will say this isn't a game for Fortnite'rs or Call of Duty players, but if any or all of the things in the Trailer appeals to your Creative, Survival Grinder, Weeb, and Adventurous side then you will enjoy the game or at least get your moneys worth. 

Skill tree is cool and panders to most types of RPG play styles, that being Warrior, Mage, Crafter, Gatherer, and some bonus Flair/trick skills.

EA on steam means Lots of bugs and lots of room for improvement. But if the Dev's keep it up with fixes and listen to the players the game can only go up from here.

Let's be honest, I am no stranger to negative reviews. The gaming world is trash right now and we are drowning in it.

It is with great honor I can say this: 
[b] Craftopia is a phenomenal new and unfinished experience. [/b]

Yes, the name is stupid. The game as it is now, though, is an almost perfect blend of BotW, Outward, and the building aspects of Fortnite.

You might ask why in the world someone would praise the addition of a Fortnite aspect into a game not meant specifically meant for children and, to that, I will say even Fortnite does something right every now and then. Many of us can agree Battle Royale games are disgusting, but the polish is undeniable.

All this aside, being that they don't add in a burdensome food and water consumption mechanic, this game is shaping up to be one of the best build/explore/survive games out there.

[h1] It is nice to see a game that gives the satisfaction of exploration mixed with combat like SkySaga did [/h1]

Don't let the trailer fool you, Craftopia is [u]VERY[/u] early on and is [u]EXTREMELY[/u] clunky and just feels underdeveloped. This general lack of polish really hurts and otherwise steller game and the amazing stuff that the game offers (which I will get into later). Currently it is completely oversaturated with reminders of just how early on in development is. 

[b]Here are some examples:[/b]
[list]
[*]The welcoming message of the game warns you of how early in development the game is
[*]The title screen rightly has a nice ""In development"" on multiplayer
[*]There is a permanent watermark on the bottom right of your screen with yet another warning of just how early the game is
[/list]

[b]Other than the blatant warnings by the development team you can see just how early the game is in development when looking at: [/b]
[list]
[*]The skill tree (at least half the skills shown aren't implemented)
[*]The really ([u]really[/u]) janky animations
[*]The tutorial (Personally got lost a few times, some missions are out of order)
[*]The translation (This is a Japanese dev team and the English translation is some of the worst I've ever seen, it's actually laughable)
[*]Spawns and NPC presence (Has a similar ARK problem where there are just tons of mobs spawning around you constantly)
[*][u]The world is actually a bunch of clusters of rather small and uninspired instanced zones [/u] that really aren't fun at all to explore, which is hugely disappointing and I am personally hoping is just temporary
[*] Boring dungeons and lack of mob variety
[*]The NPC AI (It's pretty bad)
[*]The multiplayer (is only functional in a very unstable state with a third party program called Hamachi and there is no dedicated servers yet)
[*]Optimization (Yeah, that's pretty bad, too)
[*] Audio is severely lacking with many things that should make sounds not making sounds (Like environment hazards, enemy attacks, some of your attacks, really a large amount of stuff not making sounds)
[*]Controller support is listed as in development in the controls section (But work okay, except for the janky movement not feeling nice on it)
[*]Textures and other stuff that is currently from the Unity store as placeholder (Items on the ground are 2D images lol)
[*]Isn't really any quests or NPCs to give them to you (Makes the world feel kinda lifeless, even with 100 cows and chickens constantly spawning around you)
[*]The endgame (Currently about 20 hours of content and nothing really to do once you get to end game)
[*]Really everything else, too
[/list]

[h1]But it isn't ALL bad[/h1]

[b]Somethings the game does well are:[/b]
[list]
[*]The RPG feel (It really feels like an RPG as you level up, gain skill points for new skills, obtain gear with unique traits, and use those skills and gear to slay fantastical monsters such as goblins, skeletons, and dragons)
[*]The crafting is REALLY good and is very reminiscent of My Time At Portia as you gather resources to get better resources to get better gear to gather better resources to get....
[*]Interesting skills and it's nice to see a change from the basic +2 magic attack upgrades (Skills like jump height, ordering tamable pets to do special attacks, and stopping time. Still a lot of skills that are not developed yet, too)
[*]Animal taming and pokemon catching (You even have pokeball like things you throw at creatures to tame them)
[*]Automation in crafting and storage and farming (Such as automatic mining drones and breeding animals for food)
[*] Glider and climbing system from Breath of the Wild (Though both are a bit, you guessed it, janky) and other fun methods of transportation like freaking hoverboards
[*]Slick UI that can feel a bit cluttered but does look pretty nice and is, relatively, organized well
[*] Unique items with lots of varying effects and aesthetics (mate, you can get a light saber)
[/list]
[*]The development team is taking the game seriously and are currently providing updates literally daily


[h1]The verdict[/h1]

See, Craftopia really does have a lot going for it and truly has something for everyone, the problem is that the game constantly distracts you from the otherwise awesome elements due to the severely underdeveloped current state of the game. Again, I ask you to not just go off of the trailer when considering purchasing the game.

16,75655856,english,"Early Access review: When I look at these early access games, I mainly just try to see will you get your money's worth for the price they are asking. As the game is at the time of this review, you can probably get 15h or so out of it before it starts slowing down drastically. This is assuming you are following what the game asks you to do vs doing your own thing. I can imagine veteran crafting game players could move through most of this is under 9h. Many of the progression stages are unimplemented and the main mission is currently under development. Overall I had a lot of fun while playing but I will admit its fairly short. I've played for 20h and paid $22 so I would say that is worth it.

I like that the combat is more robust that lets say minecraft, but by no means is it feeling complete. Mob AI is very simple and skills aren't necessary to overcome any enemy (even enemies 30 levels above you). Crafting is very typical with a ingot progression system. Farming was fun for a a short bit, but once you get all the seeds and crops going, you really don't feel the need to scale considering it's just for food and the buffs the food give you don't seem to make killing monsters any easier than it already is. The dungeon monsters felt just as easy to kill as cows and chickens.

There isn't a lot of challenge to the game, and the crafting system isn't robust enough to call this a factory style game because you aren't building towards some massive resource intensive item. I figured the age progression system would manage that but it's completely trivial in terms of how many materials you need to progress an age. There would be no reason to set up automation when all of this is easily doable in less time crafting by hand.

You can't call this open world either considering the dungeons are instanced, as is each island. Crafting and processing on one island seems to stop when you visit another which makes it feel like each island is not connected and part of a bigger picture... it's just another world to set up on.

21,75653137,english,"Hmmm so it has tons of things to do !

Game definitely has potential but in saying that sooo many systems none of them are polished
Lets try list all the things in this-
Automate options (conveyor belts/auto factories)

Crafting     (homes/weapons/gear/items/!!Wonders of the world!!)

*Cooking  Stone and potatoes anyone?

Pokemon   (use these diamond shape pokeballs one time catch) Though you just catch em cant battle em, dont seem to defend you yet though they do love you.

Farming     (Farm everything including pokemon) missing a ton of automation options

Durability  (everything wears down) annoyingly so but as you find better materials they last longer and longer

Adventure (fight dungeons for an item you use to upgrade your char currently has no roof)

Char Development (goes up in lvls as you Kill things and do quests) crazy funny party is you can automate this as skeletons spawn at night so you conveyor them right into a killing machine.  You earn points on each lvl and you use these points to build a char that is unique to you.  can make mages/sword guys/stealth/crafting guys tons of options this part is quite deep so far.

Temperture Effects (ie you cant hang out in snow without freezing, cant swim through lava without burning) also cant counter these effects to what i found so far.

Natural Progression ie wood-copper-iron-steel-gold-titanium-platinum-diamon-duratanium-Wolverinemetal(forgotname) Game also advances in ages as you turn in resources giving you access to more technology.

*Vehicles hand glider, hoverboards wood/steel, akira bike, helicopter, tank, buggy, biplane and probably more.

Multiplayer (yay) no local coop but i have played with a japanese freind through steam freind system.

You get to do this all while looking at what is essentially a zelda esque looking game and traversing the land with a hoverboard (ooh another thing). 

While its sorta fun to work things out the bugs are essentially turning people away.  Everything feels not quite right.  

At this point i do recommend as it has some serious potential but lets hope the japanese work ethic holds up as there sooo much that needs to be fixed.

I see what Craftopia wants to be -- a sand box universe that gives players freedom for doing various things ranging from adventure to farming. It has its charm even though it is in Early Access and it indeed contains a huge load of bugs.

However, playing single player in this isn't so bad at all. The bugs I found were not so critical that I had to ragequit, no. They are acceptable bugs that are foreseeable because of the tag Early Access per se.
I still do recommend this game for those who are looking for a game to spend some time with in this genre.

35,75649371,english,"Let me just start by saying I like the game a lot. I think it has a lot of potential. So I had a few ideas in mind. Maybe you could make it so you can improve weapons by repairing them a lot once the repair table is added. So every time you repair it and it is damaged enough, its durability will increase or it will do more damage. Another idea is being able to make monsters you've tamed follow you and attack other creatures, I don't know for sure if it's in the game yet or not but when I tamed something it just seemed pointless. I also found that I had 2 of the same island, and my robots that were supposed to cut trees did nothing but stand there after cutting 1 or 2 trees. Also maybe better gliders, if there aren't any already. Maybe many more armors and hats, from dungeons to travelling merchants. And also a bit better camera control. I think it would be nice for rather than having 2 separate items for boy and girl armor, have it set to whatever the player's body is. Another thing that is really big for me and I love, is infinite gameplay. Perhaps make it so you can gain as much power as you'd like, for example leveling up for that +5 health. I really like rpgs with endless content, and this having endless content would make this game so much better if it already isn't added. A big thing is maybe better multiplayer joining, so you could just join a random session or server, but you might be working on that already. So some more things - Make it so you can ride some tamed animals if you haven't already, better sign formatting, and just more variety although I know you are working on that as well.

Pros
Fun play 
good graphics
farming and crafting are pretty in dept for such a brand new game.
many different level zones, so even once you max the current gears you can still keep fighting higher level mobs.
GLIDERS and HELICOPTER are a good time.

Cons
combat is a bit clunky, but still easily playable
hunger happens way too fast IMO
gear durability is obnoxious and you're constantly breaking your new toys.

Overall, for a new game it has a lot of potential and I hope the Devs stick to it and keep adding more and more. It is an early access, so don't buy this game expecting it to be WoW. I am still playing and will still keep playing with my friends and exploring the different zones. It is worth $20

Aside from the joke, this game is just extremely rough. With a GTX 970 OC'd, the game runs incredibly poorly with no real option to edit the graphics other than lowering the resolution (to my knowledge) which just looks dreadful in full screen. The game just doesn't feel fleshed out at all, my mate compared this game to a skeleton which I completely agree with. I see a lot of comments mentioning the potential of this game and yes this game HAS potential (like any other early access game) but damn, it's got a long way to go for sure.

The steam multiplayer mode that the game [u]recommends[/u] doesn't work at all so have fun either port forwarding or using hamachi, I swear to god there's sounds missing from the game and the only real fun we had with this money laundering scheme was laughing at the poor of a state it's in. 

This isn't even worth £10 let alone £17, don't buy unless you find constantly tracking your hours in game just to make sure you've not gone over the 2 hour refund period fun and exhilarating. It should honestly be against the Geneva Convention to charge £17-19 for what seems to be a pretty underwhelming tech demo.

The most fun we had was using [b]objectively[/b] the most overpowered spell in the game, the firemaking spell. With this spell, you're granted but [strike]not[/strike] limited to:
   - An Ordinary campfire

CONS:
-Very Buggy but active fixes

I enjoyed it. As many say this game took ALOT of insperation from zelda breath of the wild. However i dont see that as a bad thing. I think this could be a good relaxing game to play by yourself but i think it will shine when they get friends to play with you. This would be a good game to play with say a girl friend.

The Combat is low grade but has alot of potental. By low grade i mean not alot of tatics required. However the spells the play can learn are fun. Clunky but fun.


The game itself is a little clunky. What i mean by clunky is some things don't work all of the time as intended. It also uses mission to push you to learn the game.

           - The Scenery is beautiful I love the wind effect with the twinkle effect really makes it emotional
           - crafting is easy and not that much of hassle
           - Its wierd with all the different kind of farm animals all over the map but it has it charm which i like.
           - The colors are nicely done and the animals are designed nicely as well
           - I like how smooth the weapons work especially the whole skill system is pretty neat but could use more adjustments as well. 
           - Water animation is really clean and clear very attractive. 
           - Fishing finally working  and easy to do which im grateful for.
           - Monster prism works now
           
Con's : - Crafting and grinding may be easy but you don't really get much EXP from them unlike when fighting monsters it should be reconsidered since this is has crafting for most parts.
            - The hovering is still kinda wonky especially when its on water might need a bit more stability.
            - Names in map would be helpful as well
            - Character customization hopefully you can add more options on editing the character like height, more hair color or design. 
            - Characters aren't as smooth yet it is kinda pixelated at some parts.
            - The anubis god is always at the edge of the flying platform so its kinda hard to talk to him without being careful falling off the edge and going up again. 
            - Its not as interactive RPGish since not a lot of NPC's are there yet. all i've met for now are just the blacksmiths and sellers. 
            - I haven't seen a city or a town yet but im still playing this so i'll say more on that when i have covered at least half of it?
            - I have seen camels and some other animals as well...is there gonna be a mounting system for them? that we can ride some animals in some way? 
            - Some of the items don't really have information on where to find them and such hope it would be fixed as well.
            - Items cannot be rotate manually yet so this also needs a fixing. Things are so wobbly when u put a crafted item. By the way the Drying rack isn't stable to stand on its own. It just falls  LOL. its said that its not yet in use but wierdly enough that made me laugh.
           

Wishes to see in the future : - I hope they make a diving system in the waters 
                                              - I wish they make more armor or outfits
                                              - The customization i really want to edit it like sims where u can adjust height, color, body shape, and the like.
                                              - I hope that the NPC's become more interactive because its kinda lonely just roaming around the whole are by yourself with all the animals but not much humans in sight. 
                                              - Pet system or mounting of Animals would be so much appreciated <3
                                              - I also wish that they input a storage upgrade system cause its very limited but mygod the one with the chest with the conveyor belt was so huge but the slots were like just 2 rows and its not really that much but the size of it is too big for its size....I do hope this is also fixed. its kinda ridiculous at the size and space given.
     
This is just a personal experience and Things that i have seen from the game. since this is an early access its not yet perfect but the whole commenting on what you've seen or what needs to be fixed will help the developers along the way as well. This really gave me Zelda, Pokemon, Archage, Satisfactory, fortnite, and some other games combines as well which is really unique but yeah it really needs a lot of work to be done.

Enemies seem kinda cool but the animations are still mediocre, they have regular mobs and bosses.  Nice amount of  wildlife.  I've seen a bird, fox, cows, sheep, bears and these things called mono that will jump at you and cause minimal damage, they're kind of annoying lmao.  You can jump on the animals and ""ride"" them, you won't slide off their back while they walk around, it's funny jumping on a bears back.  The building is pretty cool, lot's of freedom to build where ever you like pretty much, but you are limited to buildings like walls, floors and ramps snapping in place.  Placing fires is funny sometimes because it will clip something and fling into the air and catch everything on fire LOL.  It's funny watching it catch a tree of fire, then a bird catches on fire, then that bird catches another tree on fire that catches a sheep on fire and it just keeps catching everything on fire, I love it.

And I should note that if you port forward MAKE SURE TO CLOSE THE PORT WHEN YOU'RE DONE by either disabling or deleting the rule opening that port or however you can.

- Faster attack animations to not lock your character in place (feels clunky)
- Dodge should be cancel attack animation (be prioritized), and dodge should be usable while standing still.
- Don't give materials or foods modifiers; it makes no sense and also takes up extra space. 
- Add selling option to merchant
- Make bow and arrow easier to use; arrows shouldn't need to be equipped so let the bow use arrows straight from inventory.
- Add more detailed descriptions on skills; upgrades should have numerical values for clarity.
- Make a spawn point setter (e.g. bed)
- Players should spawn at where they saved and quit the game instead of default spawn

Understanding that this is early access, but here are some thoughts regarding the game. If you enjoyed breath of the wild, this game greatly resembles that from the cosmetic standpoint to the game play. Exploration is not diverse much akin to what this game aspires to be, but it is still enjoyable. 

What absolutely cannot be ignored however, is the online experience. Sever frame drops and lack of proper multiplayer at the moment. My friends and I have to rely on an outsourced program to connect to a private server in order to play together. This game, standalone as a single player experience is not a great game. Also, there are a great deal of translation errors that are not to be ignored from the UI to the translations of what each skill does. 

Where this game really shines, is the multiplayer, and the lack of it there of at the moment will be fixed in the future as promised by the developers. Hopefully, with improved frame rates, and dedicated servers.

1.  VERY early access.  There is a lot of 'Coming Soon' aspects, the potential here is great but rather big roadblocks to feeling like there is progression.  A lot of the critiques of this game will stem from this.

2.  Colorful vibrant world but still somewhat repetitive early on.  Its great to have a good amount of mobs to farm the necessary tools needed to craft but after you change 'Ages' it can feel like a big hurdle to enjoyment with bothersome low level mobs crowding around a tiny village you have started to make.  Would be nice if the 'Age' changed more aspects than what is available to craft.  Maybe a map reset or additional mobs for higher level mats.

3. There's no overarching story line besides the 'Mission/Tutorial' that doesn't do a good job explaining things after you start advancing.  This is another 'Coming Soon' but releasing a game without ANY kind of progression/story will very quickly devolve into running around in circles.

Overall, I am loving the look and feel of the game even with the work in progress/bugs.  I am glad to support this developer because this scratches a very specific itch that other similar games don't have.  If you don't have the $22 dollar price tag lying around I would not recommend purchasing and waiting till later.

- For $20~30ish bucks, i think its worth the money
- PVE Co-op up to 8 player (for now? only from Host PC for multiplayer), i hope developers would create dedicated servers for this game and maybe even a PVP aspect in future
- Highly Interesting concept;   I summarize it as a "" Zelda/Dragon Quest Builders changed to an RPG with 7 days to die grinding with Satisfactory automation features"";

My opinion:
I hope the developers complete this game since many features are still under development;  If they complete it with a great story line it'll be a great hit in my opinion

Game play:
- You can stay in one place and grind enemies to mainly level up your character or if you want or you can open up new worlds and fight new enemies and bosses;  enemies/animals does re-spawn after killing it or when you re-enter the map (leveling up is no hassle with right weapon);  Once you level up you can select the talent tree to suite your play style such as barbarian, magic, farming, joker style, or mixture of plays.  There is still features under development but most of the talents i selected was very enjoyable. 

- You can open up other islands and find necessary minerals for crafting;    Interestingly... the material you collect from certain location has a unique powers when you craft it into an object;  i.e. if you fight the golem it will drop a golem stone instead of the regular stone you grind from rocks;  when you craft with it it will have a unique powers to the items like stronger defense, etc.   I havn't checked or listed up all items but all animals or enemies drop materials that has unique powers... Its fun to find out these features if your into such things.. if not thats ok too to just craft with the items since it doesn't  affect the game play or story line

- Crafting wont level you up but similar to the PC game ""Satisfactory"" you'll start building things for automation and so far after my 15 hours into the game... i still have and want things to craft... addicting....  you can craft more items to create better items;  It's not as slow starting like ARK or 7 days to die;  everything you craft is mostly instant and even if you misplace an object you can pick it back up to place.  I recommend placing the flat wood surface and put the crafting object on top... some items (probably bug) can disappear if you place it on the normal ground

- Grinding for Item drops are also fun from animals, enemies, and Boss fights and inside the dungeons;  Every time its unique drop from enemies and hidden chambers.  I keep filling up my inventory

Con 
 - it's still under development... don't know when the next updates will be
 - During intense fighting... Mini-Boss sometimes falls into surrounding environment
    In my case a mini-boss died in a Lava
 - Not all features are available.... (again still under development)
 - only up to 8 coop, no known dedicated server to play on
    (if you want, be the host and leave your computer on for your friends to join whenver)
 - the storage boxes are notoriously small considering all the items you carry back from the other world
    (so far I have like 30+ storage boxes to store my stuff... i'm only level 18), wish there was a sorting feature

Pro
- was on sale, worth the 20~30ish bucks
- easy but hard enough to enjoy leveling up fighting enemies, animals, and boss
- lots of fun skill tree, i think lots of replay value
- lots of crafting and stage advancing to do (feels endless yet very fun)
- zelda style graphics, not too realistic but not too childish like Dragon Quest Builders

Another summary...It's a mixture of several great games; 
    Zelda - battle style, flying, Boss fights
    Satisfactory - you start crafting and use new equipment to automate the mineral mining features 
    7 days to die - Crafting Gyrocopter and Bike
    Fortnite - the build factor for ramps

45,75457115,english,"Edits after 40 hours of playing:
Had my eye on this for the last half a year. It's definitely a steal for the price.

Pros:
-Looks to be at least 8 unique areas/maps. But as you expand the map they you can get maps you've been to before at a higher level.
-Controls are tight
-Lots of build and fool around with
-Cool skill/level up trees I did not expect
-I've actually been killed by some enemies... Like, it's not just ez mode roflstomping bad guys.
-You make your own fun. There is no plot, there's no point where you say ""Okay, I've beaten the game"". You sort of need to continuously find new challenges for yourself.
-You can mass create hundreds of massive level 89 elephants in breeding chambers,  lagging the map until you leave the area or slaughter them all for massive XP gains.

Cons:
-Poor translation (but who cares if the gameplay is solid). I suspect this will improve in a few weeks/months
-Multiplayer has been improving each day since day 1. My friends are always able to connect to my game, but sometimes we have to use Hamachi's IP connection. Which isn't really an issue.
-No XP sharing. Which isn't actually all bad, but it kind of sucks when a boss dies and only 1 person levels up.
-Leveling up more than 1 level at a time only yields 1 skill point. I hope this is a bug that will soon be fixed.
-Fucking Alexandria spawning in my base because of the social table, pooping everywhere, catching fire off my camp fire, running around burning, running into me, and causing me to catch fire.

55,75614824,english,"Craftopia is one of the worst survival games, I have played.  While it has some features that could make it good.  It also feels like they rushed to get it into the state it is to start making money off it.  Cratopia feels more like a pre-alpha game and more of a concept to pitch to a publisher.  Than an Alpha or Early Access.

Combat I am not sure they want it to be arcade or rpg.  It just feels very unfinished.  Creatures go flying like you just hit a Roger Clemens fastball.  Harvest can be a chore as he does not always hit direction of the crosshair. Using the hover board uses stamina when you charge it which to me is kinda silly.  Be like flying an Mig and the afterburners run off the pilots stamina.   At the same time, climbing up a the side of a mountain only takes stamina when you jump higher but not holding onto it.

I went into a dungeon, and killed a Goblin.  Which was probably the size of an Ogre.  Then something was casting fireball at me but it went so slow.  It was easy to dodge it.  I never tested magic myself so other than that, I cannot comment on it.

Some things feel they were just stuck into crafting tables, not sure why hide armor is in the anvil and not more the hat table that would make more sense.  Some items are listed in the crafting table but you don't require it to make them. Snapping items to where you want them is impossible, they have to go where the game thinks they should so it becomes a chore to make things work right.

The island method I am not a huge fan of.  Would rather some bigger islands.  Maybe make less smaller ones but the teleports could be a great way to visit other ones.  Just not so damn small.  Dungeons are cool, I really like the Survival/RPG concept this game has.  I can see a lot of potential in it.

With time things may change but in its current state I cannot recommend this game unless you support EA devs.  This is definitely a game you can put on the wishlist though and follow.

For example, crafting gear with specific animal parts causes that gear to get certain stat bonuses for that gear. As such, you dont want to just use bog standard materials to craft your best equipment, especially once you find affixed materials that provide just the thing you were looking for (early on, bear leather is a good example of this).

The current problem with that system lies within the current implementation of it. You cannot actually pick which types of materials you use for crafting, so because of that its best to drop all other affixed materials except for the one you WANT to use to get the desired effects on your equipment. Theres also a rather low range of gear you CAN actually craft and hopefully there will be a lot more in the coming future.

List time:

-Vehicles: Unusable, break in 5 min and somewhat a pain to build. You also cant pack them up after they're deployed.
-Automation: Broken and unstable. Tracks don't lead directly to important machines.
-Captures: Unpolished. You cannot put something back into the ""pokeball"".
-Combat: Fun but janky.
-Translation: Understandable sometimes. Sometimes completely untranslated.
-Crafting: Unbalanced. Some items are way too cheap, some way to expensive.
-Base Building: Pretty basic, but not the worst.
-Inventory Management: One of the worst parts. Every item has a different name based on what NPC dropped it, even if they're both the same item. It fills your inventory with 7 of the same item.
-Leveling: One of the best parts, but hard to understand due to bad translation.
-Optimization: Not terrible, but minimal options to tweak.
-AI: Dumb AF, but kinda funny.
-Keybinds: Not the worst, but if your going to copy BOTW, you need to refine the controls.
-Artsyle: Blatant copying in places and inconsistent, however pretty. Does make me worry about a DMCA from Nintendo. The ""Enemy Scull Camps"" are a near identical replica of BOTW. And the ""Male body in underwear"" could be a direct rip from BOTW.

Dont get me wrong. I'm very negative in this review, but this game could be amazing. Give it a couple of months and see what happens. I understand this is ""Early Access"", but this game really should've had more dev time before it was released to the public. Even for an early access game, this is REALLY unfinished. My tip for the devs: DON'T GIVE UP. You've got something good here, just needs some love and care. And in case you don't bother translating reviews: ""あきらめないで"".

4,75600459,english,"First i would like to say like everyone else that this game has so much potential, its an early access build for a game in development so i'm reviewing this based on that.

-The game is very beautiful to look at a few graphical hitches here and there but for the most part pretty solid. The crafting and building mechanics are also great and i have had a good time exploring and gathering resources with friends and i hope it gets expanded further to allow more decorative base building and housing options.

-The good-

- The maps are very unique and BIG and have lots of potential to offer im honestly shocked at the amount of hours i spent walking around 2 of the 121(?) maps that are in the game right now.

-Music is good for the most part i can see this also being an area of improvement and implementation.

-Combat while clunky at times can be pretty fun and has a lot of depth to actually make yourself unique in some ways (ill discuss my negatives in the improvements list,)

-Advancing the ages feels quite rewarding but would be nice if there was compendium that was easier to access through one place to check how to obtain certain items.

-Now for improvements-

This game has so much potential and ill try my best to say what can be changed to make this game a hard hitter.

-Combat improvments-
I know its early access and Sound effects are not exactly implemented yet but melee combat needs good weighty hit confirming sound effects it really change how the combat would feel, right now everything is weightless and flimsy. 

What would remedy this is better enemy hit stun animations and revenge values that were not every 2 or so hits or visual enemy attack indicators to able to retaliate to them, also a great addition would be the implementation of a visual auto lock on and lock on system, that would really allow for more combat fluidity and more magic adding some cast bar or some kind of delay indicator for spells (A weapon selection wheel and multiple switchable hotbars would also be nice).

-Maps-
While the dense environments are awesome, some of the enemy and wildlife do not match certain climates seeing cows on a volcano or in the desert is pretty strange but this is planned to be kept as is, implementation of a few unique enemies to each climate that can offer rare options for crafting, it would add some excitement to finding special mobs. 

Another thing would be mob spawning, an issue ive had is mobs spawning in my base that i have built which can be frustrating so a way of claiming an area that stops mobs spawning in a set location for camps and have them spawn elsewhere would really help maybe something like a protection crystal you can craft(?) another interesting addition would be optional camp invasions to fend off mobs for rewards.

-Transport and monster catching-
It would be nice to have more in depth tutorials for the monster catching and vehicles, I failed catching alot of stuff before i realised i needed to weaken the enemy and the vehicle controls are a bit wonky at times which can be fixed! seeing some water vehicles like boats and rafts for future updates would be awesome too.

-Bugs-

-There are many bugs in the game atm but thats totally expected so ill just point out a few, the crafting system where you have to look at your spawn point to get things to pop into your inventory which is very strange.

- In multiplayer there are invisible tree that randomly combust which can only be seen by certain players, ive randomly caught fire and died plenty because i couldnt see them , there are various other bugs which will get fixed down the line

-Verdict-  
Im compelled to give feedback because ive had such a great time and hope this game flourishes and becomes something great, with polish, additions and UI improvements in the right places everything will come together for this game Buy it and support the devs on this one!

TL;DR
Definitely an Early Access.

The translation is a bit spotty. The interface needs some work. Base building is clunky and buggy. Otherwise, it's a solid crafting game. The fast-action controls are fun and the worlds have plenty of content to explore. Looking forward to future updates.

Combat
- There is no targeting which causes many awkward moments stuck in an animated attack in the wrong direction

Crafting
- Many item descriptions are machine-translated and impossible to understand from reading. Through some trial and error, you should figure it out though.

Base building
- There is no foundation item. It is a ""horizontal wall"". The ""horizontal wall"" does fill in gaps or prevent spawning underneath it which causes monsters to spawn and get trapped  infinitely.

- Your base can be damaged but not repaired. Monsters that spawn under your base will eventually destroy it. Additionally, fire causes monsters to go up in flames, then rampage.. destroying anything they run into on their path.",1599431603,1599480013,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True,76561198058839919,575,34,1410,0,444,1599789378

The game has a pretty vast skilling system, also there's a lot of area to explore, unfortunately with being such a new release you can't experience everything, and for some reason npcs when killed just drop eggs... Lmfao

Other than some minor map adjustments (floating chests/barrels) due to lazier dev work the game is very enjoyable and really has the potential to be the next big thing.

This game is VERY early release, super buggy, and many features are barely implemented. If you're looking for a similar game that you can play right now and enjoy then I'd suggest moving on to something like My Time at Portia.

I'll try to ignore the games early development stage for the purpose of listing pros & cons, and rather focus on the game elements independent of their current implementation state:

Pros:
1. Fun art style
2. Combining crafting, adventuring, and magic together in a single game is a fun idea
3. Different technological ages allow for an Ark-like progression

Cons:
1. The game feels a bit too much like a BoTW knock-off to me. I love Zelda, but I would have liked to have seen more originality from the developers. The game feels like rather than being inspired by certain games, they just stole content from those games for use in this one
2. The game feels disjointed because of con 1. Rather than the developers saying ""Hey we've got this great idea for a game, and I think it would be fun to incorporate aspects of these other games into ours."" They instead said ""I love these other games, let's mash them all together into a patchwork quilt."" This robs the game of any soul that it could hope to achieve.
3. Combat consists of left+click and a tiny bit of dodging. It's very simplistic, and boring",1599475999,1599476442,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True,76561198049429108,108,24,314,0,108,1599517246

I see a huge potential to where this game can go in the future, with lots of items and places to be discovered, boss fights and dungeon trials, magic and transportation, and also automated production systems. Not to mention they have pretty character designs. 

There some bugs I would like to mention but don't let that stop you from trying out the game since it's really new and obviously there will be some bug errors. So there are a few bugs that I see during my time playing the game, I'm not sure if it violates the guidelines but I hope it doesn't but here:

-Health and level bar of npc and enemies disappears after some time playing or traveling in game.

-A treasure chest inside a cave where you have to destroy the stone first looks invisible at certain times and also no clipping.

-The Gods in the sky sometimes move like they're stuck running in one area 

-The flying orc wizard sometimes get invulnerable with a bow when they're flying stuck to the wall.

-Some item drops that are big in size sometimes can't be picked up when they're drop in a stone or somewhere.

-A grown plantation sometimes disappear and can't be harvested after you travel through the portal, so you have to disassemble it instead.

-Everything can be build mid air from walls to production stuffs.

-Some enemies are still in Japanese katakana even though my language is in English.

-There's an option to remove fps cap but it's still capped in 60fps, It's not vsync since I'm using a monitor above 60hz so it shouldn't be capped at 60fps.

-You can climb on literally anything even bosses.


This one might not be a bug but I really can't figure out where I can upgrade my weapons or other stuffs.
The vehicles are also really hard to control but that might just be me being terrible.

I might not be 100% accurate with my statements so please try not to hate. These are the only bugs I was facing during my time playing, and I do feel the health/level bar and the mid air builds the one affecting my gameplay the most. I would also find it helpful to have a health bar and HUD that can be toggled. There is also no advanced video settings to adjust graphics such as depth of field---it happens when you aim with a bow.

The game overall graphic, UI and ambient kinda inspired from Zelda and it's surprisingly good for an indie developer to pull up such things. It's Survival crafting game with MMO Element of leveling up, choosing skill and make up your own class as you want and it was hella fun to be able to play with your friends.

The reason I do not recommend this game at the moment is not the gameplay or multiplayer issue which I kinda understand since multiplayer is still in early development and it needs quite some time to be polished (I did one small multiplayer deathmatch game as my thesis and it took me 4 months and a few gallons of coffee to make it work perfectly. now imagine working on something more complicated like this game). but rather due to performance issue the game is experiencing right now, there is no graphic setting just yet. Only a few option to disable something like motion blur or adjust fov ,etc. but no real graphic preset or advance setting at all so if your game is running poorly, you'll have to sit with it for the time being as there is nothing you can do beside disabling some option or edit the config file.

My Computer spec is Ryzen 7 2700 with 5700XT which I can run rdr2 high setting with stable 60fps and I am surprised that this game is struggling at 25-50 fps most of the time.

So this is a game completely without polish- but it's in that lack of polish that I find this game at it's best. Everything is *functional*, as in I've never encountered a gamebreaking bug, but the game doesn't really act the way you think it would.

- Repairable weapons
- Day night cycle
- Good skill tree verity
- You can breakdance

Cons:
- Simple combat
- Wonky enemy A.I.
- Not a lot of character fighting combinations
- Building could use a lot of work. Placing building objects like the floor/walls all snap awkwardly instead of being more dynamic and only snapping to each other. 
- Dungeon textures could better match the overall style of the game.
- Character creation feels limited and odd. You can mix female aesthetics with males (i.e. female body with old male face lol.)


Overall it's a good game to jump into with friends. It needs a lot of work before I can give it a 10/10. I'd say this game will come out of early access in 2-3 years.

41,75584568,english,"Highly recommend this game. Played with a couple of friends-about 8 of them. The game gets pretty laggy with that many people at one time so keep that in mind.

We started off all spawning on a pier with a bunch of NPCs. They seemed really friendly, often referring to us as ""Ja"" which seemed really endearing. Decided to kick them all off the pier.

We did all the basic stuff to start off kind of like Minecraft, starting from wood into stone into copper and etc. There's a few dungeons in the starter island which were pretty fun and wonky. Hoverboards and goblins and bears and ancient golems. The highlight was definitely when we got to the loot room and there were only 5 chests. Needless to say it was a deathmatch to get loot, except without the pvp so think of it like Fall Guys. Fortunately for me, my friends are all stupid and aren't aware of the hidden walls that contain chests at the beginning and end of most dungeons.

Most of the hours we spent were on burning each other and the island down, and trying to commit mass genocide with cows because they enjoy destroying all of your buildings. Once you get to the other islands, the other animals do this as well so just to be safe, kill everything you see.

If you like femboys, minecraft mechanics with a lot of rpg elements, Dr. Stone, Harvest Moon, Breath of the Wild graphics, and literally every other game you can think of, this game might be for you.

42,75584548,english,"Bought this game based on the recommendation of a friend, I have quite a few thoughts about this game. Overall I've played for just a bit over 6 hours in multiplayer mode with a few other friends, initially setup was a bit tricky, some people need to use Hamachi in order to play multiplayer, but luckily the inherent multiplayer feature worked for my friends and I. 

Now getting to the gameplay itself, I want to start off with the fact that I absolutely adore the graphics and visuals in this game, unfortunately the game doesn't seem to be fully optimized and on 2k resolution the game looks fantastic, but frames are choppy and not smooth at all. I can make an exception for this as I understand this game is still in it's very early birth stages and I expect this to be sorted out by devs as time goes on with future patches and further optimization.
1. PVE with mobs seems to be only OK with the single handed sword, but using the dual wielded sword is a nightmare with the hitboxes not seeming to register and sluggishness. Right now it seems that the dungeon only has one boss, but there are more in development that I will be definitely be checking out once they are released!
2. Building is pretty awful imo, the places that the game wants to snap the building materials is very awkward. It's reminiscent of Fortnite building, but not as organic. I'm expecting this to be sorted out as well.
3. Crafting is probably one of the only features in this game that seems to be fully fleshed out, I haven't had any issues with it.
4. Hoverboards/mobility devices are hard to use and really buggy as well.

All in all, the game is still in it's very early stages and I understand that, which is why I am willing to give most of the flaws the benefit of the doubt. If the devs can pull everything off and get this game running smoothly then it definitely has the potential to be one of my favorite games of 2020!

First there are 121 islands, but they repeat over and over so in reality there is only about 10 different types with the same enemies and dungeons. Requirements for the islands grow but eventually its constant after the Level 7 islands. 
Second, with so many skill trees and the level cap is currently 50 there is not enough skill points to build but multiple trees. Depending on how one wishes to play it will be difficult to get a well balanced character. One could reset the points at the cost of gold but its not enough.
As of now there is not as many things to craft as one thinks. Sure it seems a lot with the multiple crafting tables but some of those have no purpose right now. Want a hat or armor? only a few to chose from and barely gives a bonus.

It's still way too early access for me to recommend in its' current form. I've seen plenty of alphas that a far more polished then what this game has to offer.

Admittedly, I only spent time on the first island and the first two dungeons with the game, but nothing stuck out as doing something really well. The combat was sloppy with possibly the worst AI I've ever seen in a video-game. The building was extremely lackluster, more akin to Fortnite than an actual survival-building game.

The game play has some influences from Mine craft and BOTW. Of course being an early access game I ran into bugs such as the shrine for advancing the age bouncing whenever placed on a slope. I also do not like the feel for the jumping attack animation as it feels off.

The games visuals look great as they are heavily inspired by BOTW's shaded art style. However this does not translate to better performance on lower system even with lowered settings.

Sometimes rocks spawn underneath wheat fields and plantations and cause them to rise up if you place them on the floor, this is just client-sided since I didn't see it as the host.

Sometimes when mining, I fall through the floor and end up below the map swimming, if you're not in multiplayer I don't know how you're gonna go up back onto ground level.

86,75574699,english,"Already I'm absolutely loving and am invested in this game.

Yes, the game is early access. This means that you can expect it to be really underwhelming or rough at times. Take for example the fact that some of the weapons, bosses, attacks, or items will simply lack sounds. The AI is not bright at all (stand near a cliff and watch a Wolf lunge at you just to go flying off into the abyss, trust me you'll laugh still after the 20th time it happens). Positioning some buildings (such as monuments) or trying to craft at times will bug out. But this also means you can set your expectations lower and go into it to just have fun.

There's so much I still feel like I can do. Each island that you branch out to is generated different from anyone else, meaning your experience will be different. I haven't even touched the automation yet, let alone half of the weapons or mechanics (like magic). I don't feel tired or burnt out, just excited to get further into it. I haven't even really touched building anything because the base mechanics of the game alone are interesting enough.

A ton exists that still needs to be done, but that also stands to show that there's a lot that CAN be done and added. If you have the funds, don't mind picking up a game that can be rough, and just going with the flow - I can recommend it. Just remember it's early access and this may be the farthest you'll ever see it get - have those expectations.

I am a bit annoyed (and here's a warning) that some things aren't explained well at all. Take for example the fact that normally any building you ""dismantle"" just gets put back in your inventory. Monuments however are different, dismantling them will let you place the building again - but you have to actually put ALL the resources back in. Example: You take the pyramid, you place it, build all three stages, and then you want to move it. When placed again it puts you back at stage 0.

19,75566871,english,"Amazing idea of a game where you have an open world to explore especially if you can get multiplayer world going. Think about having fun with your friends by playing with fire that cause you but also your friends to die :) if you have that intention ofcourse. Multiplayer for now works oke-ish / below average by port forwarding and joining through stream. There is not a lot of game breaking bugs on solo adventures except that mobs can spawn everywhere (including in your base). As for multiplayer wise... there are some stuff that you need to figure out such as only the server host can spawn pet (throwing the pokebal thingy) and vehicles so just keep that in mind. Teleport system I say works in a nice where when you teleport between island you take everyone with you, dungeons in those islands are separate so one can enter while the other one can chill outside. For the bosses the difficulty ratio might differ on how you play against them... but for now some bosses are way too easy compared to the other bosses. There are only few aspects that are horrible mostly for multiplayer worlds but surprisingly there are a lot more good than bad experience during this early access time.

20,75566772,english,"I've played this for nearly 4 hours and I feel like I've done enough to give the game a solid review - for the state it is in now. Keep in mind, it's early access and the developers are still very actively working to improve the game. I'm going to put this at about a 55% recommended - if 51% was the threshold for a thumbs up.

TLDR: If you want to support this game, buy it, but don't expect it to grip you for more than a few hours. It is very pretty - I love the artistic design. Some of the mechanics are impressively done, while others have huge issues in its current state.

The developers have done a lot of great work to get this to where it is, and for English pretty obviously not being their first language, I am very impressed. But like others have mentioned, there are some glaring language translation issues, which can be funny at times, but also pretty confusing in many places after you get a little further into the game. Some language is simply placeholder text, like items with descriptions that say ""Plan to do something with this later"". Which is cool and all, but also leaves me wondering...okay so why not just leave this out until it's a little more polished?

There's a general craft/build pipeline with different material types to level up your tools, and the ability to unlock/build new tech. This plateaus pretty quickly though making the game feel stale. Like, ""I can build that thing just to have it, but...does it serve a purpose of helping me progress, or is it just a toy to add to the collection of things I've made?""

Storyline doesn't exist yet - literally, the mission screen is blacked out. But there is skill progression, and a simple achievement system for making progress as a player. Like, ""You've mined 100 stones!... You've mined 1000 stones! You've mined...etc""

There are NPCs, but they don't do anything as far as I can tell.

Pros:
Fun Features
Levels
Exploration

Cons & Suggestions:
Buggy Multiplayer, use a Tunneling LAN VPN Software to do multiplayer
Needs More Fine-Tuned Character Customizaion like PSO2 or Black Desert Online
Lackluster skill tree, look at Disgae series or Path of Exile
More Classes would be fun like Mabinogi
Better and More Mini-games, the fishing can be better... Look at FFXV fishing
Would love the idea of being able to find/summon a COMPANION that can help fight with you and be cute
Bigger and challenging bosses, ex: attack patterns, solver, specialty
More biomes and auto-generated land features
More weather effects
More items effects like Borderlands 3 or Atelier Series
More items per age, would like more FASHION
More NPC-based quests
MORE WAIFUS/HUSBANDOS
Would love dynamic events like getting raided, pillaged, visitors, airdrops?, attacked by monsters, weather effect system
Would love a more advanced aquarium feature and more fish, look at Dark Cloud 2
More combat moves and move cancelling abilities and better enemies that have more than 2 movesets LOL
Raytracing and DLSS support (Unity is DX11? idk if possible)
More ambient features like butterflys, variety of birds, leaves, wind, particles, etc.
MORE music (not that many tracks...)
In-game camera system for taking screenshots like PSO2 or No Man's Sky or Uncharted Lost Legacy
Hopefully improve the texture and quality as well as better bitmaps
More stats and complicated enhancing or stats system like Disgae series or 

Extensible mod-api for the community! Mod support?

Ideas:
Emote Packs, Hair Packs, Era/World DLC/Expansion, could add an online PVP mode (but the game isn't made for that, rather keep it PVE)

8/10 - Solid Buy For Great Fun.

My first impression of the game left me with doubts, but I quickly found the overall feel and flow of the game and I have had a blast playing it ever since. It's like Minecraft, but easier grinding and without the survival aspect.  Although very limiting, it ensures an simplistic building experience, which I appreciate as it keeps building an easier and less emphasized aspect of the game compared to Minecraft. If Craftopia receives a decent bit of polishing during its early access it will definitely be a game worth considering. Note that this game was just made available on Sept. 5th 2020.

The game runs smooth most of the time and even with just 40+ fps I don't find it to be much of a problem on the overall experience, maybe due to the art style making up for it.

Other than that its a nice little collection features. I like the epochs systems. Crafting system feels good. I like the quality of life built into the game. Example of quality of life being instead of taking up like 10 inventory slots for different animal meat and leather etc. it's only set to 1 slot and all the different kinds of meats/leathers are listed there. The repair system is also far superior to most crafting games I've played. Instead of needing to constantly farm outdated resources to repair your pickaxe or sword you can just spend a nominal fee to get it back to full durability. I feel the chance of durability loss on repair is a fair price to pay for not needing to constantly be farming materials to keep your shit from breaking.

As is stands now it is hot mess of janky thrown together mechanics that neither work too well together or are in DIRE need of polish (building being one of those) 
Right now it feels really like the devs said that they wanted to have as many mechanics as possible that they think are fun but there is no unit. 
Art styles are all over the place for buildings, enemies and npcs and Combat/survival is also very ehhhhh. And many things are so obscure and dont make sense that you cant enjoy trying to understand them (getting batteries for example)

(also the english translation is the worst I have seen so far but that is only a warning and not a nagging point)

Wait either for a propper sale (min 30%) or if you have 20 bucks to spare go for it. 
I would recommend waiting and I will do check out the game again if major things happen but atm I could only ""force"" myself for 4h

Bottom line, guys, this game is amazing -- and holds a lot of potential. It's got quite the load of bugs, and is still under constructions, but the team is paying close attention to all the bug reports and suggestions the community is giving them on the Discord, and even here on Steam. They are listening, and patches will come out in time as they fix these bugs and improve on the game.

Give it a chance. And if playing a buggy, early access isn't your thing? Then simply don't buy it and wait until things get patched up some more. So many people will be quick to downvote this game because of the bugs, but give it a genuine chance. The team is still small, and they don't have the backing and funding a big name brand does.

This is a critical time for Craftopia, and trolls and those who are too quick to throw it out the window could destroy the game's future. So as a big-time fan of this game, and someone who seriously wants to see where they take it, please -- give it a chance!

---------------------------------------------------
*-means updated information from initial review.

10% loaded......(Semi-Bare minimum review)

Combat: Little wonky but not broken completely. Very interesting how you can use a variety of things to your advantage. If wonky combat frustrates you, stay away. If you aren't bothered by EA cumbersome, stay. *It takes some getting used to. There is so many skills...SO many. May dabble in Magic next.

Graphics: Not realistic but not cartoon style. I won't be comparing it to another well known game but it's the same style. Those that want realistic, stay away. If you are not that bothered, stay. 

Crafting: Barely scratched the surface and there's already quite a bit. Even more than some other accesses that I've been apart of. Want only the bare minimal to craft, go away. Want a range of materials and everything? Stay. 

Taming: *Tried a little bit in it. Throwing the taming devices can be a pain when tossed at little creatures. I like foxes small, fast, and a hard to hit target. Need to get health down low before you can tame them. After all the trouble, successful tame. Was on a mountain and he dropped to his death, water around;. Sorry little fox. Was never meant to be. Need further investigating.

Price: Spent to invest. If you are interested in investing in the promise of the game. It may be steep but the pricing isn't anything more than ark survival had in the beginning.

Content: *Seems to have quite a bit. A lot if the maps are repetitive but that is mentioned in the loading screens as on-going. There is too many items for the amount of inventory. The market is getting tired of my misc item selling just to clear the inventory. Note to self, need to set up a base and stop exploring.

Mobility: So far it is easy to travel between the glider and the hover board. The hover board is way too quick and hard to get used to, further testing is required. Only on the beginner island so need more experience before reviewing this entirely. *Hover board is becoming handy but not necessary.

Survive Aspects: So far there is a food / saturation meter to look after. While I believe it is consumed too quick, food is far from being scarce and hard to find. Not much of an issue. It makes it's presence known without actually being a complete burden.

*Multiplayer: Still loading...N/A

Lag: Experience a hitch here and there but nothing too great. PC is not top end but it isn't a potato. I would rate my PCs specs as Medium-High Range.

*Base Building: So far, it's troublesome trying to find a good spot. Not much of the map is flat lands or is already invaded by hostile NPCs. Not a whole lot of variety to the actual base building but there is a ton of other things to construct. Haven't tried my hand at the drone. Want to find a good spot before putting down a farm.

Impressions: Not far into the game. Only have been at the first island and ran around destroying everything and crafting. It's a unique experience that sets itself apart from other early access that I've played. It serves it's niche and let's hope it keeps headed that way. Spent to invest. Will update further when I feel an update will benefit others. * So far it is an enjoyment. If they keep it up, it should be great. Not a variety in monsters and maps but they make that known in the tool tips on the loading screens. It's barely been out so I would give it time.

Bugs: None so far. I don't consider the odd translation slip a bug. *Found that there's a building where the NPC decided to just...stop at creating a door to the house and that's it. While ugly to look at. Not game breaking.",1599333659,1599406095,True,4,0,0.527531087398529053,0,True,False,True,76561198008605781,167,14,1642,25,70,1602032768

- Some issue which I not sure that it's a bug or it just that the game not complete coding on that content yet. but just let it pass for now.

It's a little bit hard to tell that I recommend this game or not, but I choose to recommend this game though it more like recommend to give the fund to let dev team has enough money to keep improve this game.

3,75535499,english,"I would recommend this game if you enjoy a Breath of The Wild/Minecraft mix there are some things wrong with the game that I will point out I know the game is in early access so I hope they will be fixing these issues.

Issues:
1. I've had multiple plantations/sprinklers fall thru the ground. (I did make plantations on floors and those haven't fell thru so if you plan on doing farming I would make floors just to be safe)
2. A couple trial doors not opening after talking to the receptionist even tping out and back in was doing nothing.
3. The enemies just seem too weak I'm only lvl 25 and I just started a lvl 41 area but everything just does 1 dmg to me other than burn and boss monsters it makes the combat a little lackluster most of the time when you're exploring also the crocodiles a.i. just seems to always miss attacks if you are close.
4. Chest will get rid of items if you accidentally dismantle it with items in it.
5. I would enjoy if the storage space of chest would be increased container's just take up way too much space for only a little more storage space. (I think just 4 stack like in inventory would help) Also the World History storage doesn't work I've built the pyramid and everytime I interact with it nothing happens.
6. There is going to be a bit of stuff you won't really know how to make due to translation they are working on this so you kinda just gotta figure a bunch of the stuff out yourself but most of the essentials are easy to learn.
7. The hoverboard controls are a little wonky on keyboard and mouse (I may just need to use it more) Also the Hot Air Balloon seems pretty useless just moves way too slow.

The game itself is pretty fun it can get repetitive after a little but once more content comes out should take a bunch of that out.

Incredible game. If they hopefully don't abandon this masterpiece, this will easily be one of the best games on full release. There is tons of content for a game that started early access only 2 days ago, other titles have that content after 1 year of early access. The game feels like a mix of several different games, u have the RPG content with talents for magic, melee and gathering, then u have automated systems like in Factorio or Statisfactory (not much yet, but enough to start with) u can port to different Isles and as far as I've seen u can build your base on any isles u like, u can farm crops (also automated) u can throw a magical pokeball to catch monsters u like (dunno if u can catch everything).

10,75532531,english,"So this game if still very Alpha.  However most of the core systems are in place and you can see what the devs are aiming for.  Sort of a mixture of Breath of the Wild, Satisfactory, and Rune Factory with other random fun elements.  The core game loop is that you spawn on an island, you gather raw resources, you use those resources to upgrade your gear and base, and then you use that gear to conquer dungeons and bosses before advancing to the next island.  Very similar game loop to Terraria.

The combat system is a very fluid breath of the wild type system that evolves as you progress to include the sort of over the top actions that you would see in an eastern MMO.

Crafting is very similar to dragon quest builders where you break items to gather them and then use a work station to build the item. The item then completes over a period of time before you can collect it.

Dungeons and AI are very very basic at this stage.  You can basically left click to win, but the various skills you can unlock hints at them wanting to get to a very active combat in line with most action based MMOs.

Building is very Satisfactory or Fortnite.

Overall I'm quite happy with what they're showing so far.  But like any early access product, the keys moving forward will be the frequency of updates, interaction with the community, and continued improvements to the game.

     I've played craftopia for about 9 hours straight and i am thoroughly enjoying the game. It doesn't stray from it's game description and but it's not intimidating. in the beginning you are guided by the missions but it doesn't hold your hand. I've tried to maximize my age before moving on to the next map which is how i think you're ideally supposed to play, but i'm under the assumption you can stay on a map for a long time and not miss out on much. I'm level 21 and played for the most part 7 hours straight before taking a break. I did spend a lot of time trying to upgrade the Age of the game and mining resources (but that's how I wanted to play it). This is a open world sandbox after all. 

First glance
     The graphics are visually pleasing, but make sure to optimize your resolution in the settings upon downloading because at first, in my experience, it had been set at the lowest resolution at default. Mechanics are smooth, haven't experienced a glitch so far, so kudos. Sometimes the fish don't bite when you're fishing? Maybe i'm missing something. I thought it was cool you could choose to be a melee user, ranger, or a mage user so i'm pretty stoked for what's to come. I put my frame limit to unlimited and my resolution native to my monitor at 1920x1080 and i did not have any stutter or lag skips. Sometimes i would black screen for about 1 second, but i believe that's probably due to my Amd Freesync. 

Mechanics
      From what i've seen the more you level up, the slower you gain experience, and when you level up you gain points for your skills, and i'm not the biggest fan of having to choose which path you go in terms of *class* you want your character to be strong at but it's subjective. I also like the fact that you have to create a separate bench in order to create bows and and swords and such.

Overall
     Enjoying the game through and through and will continue to play with high expectations. Well worth the price tag.

68,75516146,english,"Okay, don't get this game....yet. For starters, this game is pretty sweet. There is already quite a bit of content, and it's refreshing to unlock new items and get ideas for what to do. Exploration, combat, farming, automation, etc, it's all there and works as much as you'd think. There are ton of skills to unlock (although many of them aren't implemented yet) and it makes me really excited to level up because a lot of these skills push the boundaries of what most games would allow you to do (again not implemented yet, but we're talking flying, becoming a giant, and other cool stuff).

Now for the issues. There's quite a few. Obviously this game is japanese, and very few things have been manually translated into english. Therefore, it can be hard to understand what some of the things in the game do, but it doesn't take too long to figure it out. Secondly, there are some optimization issues. My rig isn't the greatest, but most games run perfect on it on high settings. This game doesn't necessarily stutter, but it feels...choppy. Luckily, I haven't had any crashes at all, but there have been plenty of reports of such a thing from many people doing many different things. Multiplayer is also a bit jank right now too, not much too talk about there, but they're working on making it stable.

Overall, it's a very good experience, and I'm excited to see where it goes. It has amazing potential to become a 3D Terraria of sorts, and I greatly look forward to where the devs take it. If you're willing to put up with some gripes, then I'd say give it a shot and help yourself understand how the game works early on before it gets too complicated.

You'll spend about the first hour crafting all sorts of things and then it will start to level out and become more about sustaining your ability to go from island to island exploring dungeons which seem a bit bland and overly repetitive at this time, but slowly new enemies are being added and this game is still early access. The first few islands are a bit small, but quickly they start getting larger and it becomes apparent that you'll be needing more resources and vehicle transportation to explore at a steady rate. 

Combat doesn't seem to be overly challenging and is easy to pick up especially once you unlock the dodge rolling ability and are able to heal yourself. This game has a relaxing atmosphere and not the adrenaline pumping sort that you'd expect from Ark. I'd recommend this title if you'd like to just chill out and not worry too much, there's some threats and you can be taken off guard during base building operations, but they're not overly difficult to deal with. 

There is farming and plenty of food crafting options which have their own benefits. Weapon crafting can be ignored once you get a decent melee weapon as you'll be farming plenty of dungeons for loot which will be laden with weapons. You'll be making plenty of vendor stalls to make the most of things that you don't need. 

The magic system is nice, although your offensive abilities are pretty lack luster at first and can be a bit of a struggle to use until you level them up a bit and with most of your level ups coming from fighting certain creatures and not crafting it can be a bit of a chore to get it off the ground unless you don't mind using a melee weapon for a bit. 

So far my gripes with the game is that it will not repair weapons while in a dungeon so you'll want to carry a back up. You don't seem to be able to perform crafting functions while standing on your own platforms unless you use a bench. Long waiting times for vendor stalls to sell your loot. Your inventory space becomes limited rather quickly from drowning in dungeon loot. Also storage spaces leaves much to be desired.

[*] Some texts are still in Japanese characters and some are translated using machine translate
[*] Most animations are still clunky and weird (e.g jumping animation). Moreover, the default running animation is set to female characters, regardless of your character sex, which is a big turn off for me after seeing my character (male) running like a sissy.
[*] There are no option to rotate options when building, you have to do it manually by moving your characters.

I will get to the point at the beginning so as not to be boring, the game has a great future if the appropriate changes are made, such as the artificial intelligence of the mobs, the animations in general, although this was said in its output. Statement it would be good to improve it in the future, for multiplayer which is what I played the most with 2 friends, it would be good if the portal did not transport everyone when traveling between islands.

Finally, something more personal, I would like it to be a little more complicated in the difficulty, such as when changing ages, or getting advanced minerals, it is true that I do not know how many types of minerals there are or open in the game, but for our part We got to the second era quickly, since the combat is polished I hope it also has some progressive difficulty,

The game as it is with many bugs and etc, is super fun, it reminds me a lot of Zelda, combined with Ark in the crafting and some Age of empires in the change of ages.

I really hope you can perfect the game as you say you would like it.

Pros
chill music

skills to invest in when leveling
options in how you want to fight in between magic bows and swords and more to come as they have stated
Various biomes to explore 
progressing through ages feels rewards as we get more access to more  stuff rather than minecraft oh i found x thing so i can do x thing
i can get access to a helicopter lol

Cons
combat feels like it needs targeting i can't tell you how many times I've tried to hit things and also be hitting a rock which lowers durablity of items
the translation, some of it is broken english but its EA so give it time
BOTW day 1 frame problems lol, like I said EA so I hope it gets better, I have had more frame problems in the overworld than in dungeons though
needs more keybinding bars, just for convenience to be honest im getting tired of switch a lot of stuff around for any occasion (needs skills to fight, but then when im doing builds or farming i need to swap all that out be easier just to have more of them)
a certain enemy needs to stop getting hit once and being blown away like a volleyball lol

36,75494285,english,"Recommended but with huge caveat: Expect an extremely unfinished game at this stage. The aesthetics are great, but the polish on mechanics is still lacking at this stage.

The game is mainly a survival/crafting game sprinkled with MMO and building aspects. If you're reading this review by now I am pretty sure I don't need to reiterate all the features the game promises or has. At this point in time I have experienced the following: Combat, Building, Crafting, Dungeons.

Combat is decently in-depth for a survival game, much more akin to light MMO systems. You have skill trees that offer passives and actives, and each time you gain experience to level up you spend a point to develop your build. You can either pump into Melee Combat, Basic Moves like dodge and air dash, Magic spellcasting and general gathering skills. The problem with the skill tree however is that almost 90% of combat skills are actives, these actives don't exactly synergize well with each other as well, they are very isolated and you don't feel incentivized to bother buying most of these skills.

My biggest gripe with combat is the way you and the AI moves. There is no lock-on function, so when you do a swipe or lunge, it is often going to miss. Your character is animation-locked when casting anything, and you can't even do a dodge cancel. Enemies have no weight or drag when moving, they dash around you and the terrain with extreme speed like skates on ice. A bear can dash up the mountain with the same speed it does on the ground. Enemies will often move around randomly, and half the time you don't even know if they are even fighting you.

The music is serviceable, but the problem with sound is that sound effects is mostly lacking. There is almost no sound made by enemies. They are almost always completely silent, even the boss fights. The only sound effects you will hear come from your spells and attacks, which even then sound pretty basic. Dungeons are basically just hearing the same music blaring loudly as you can barely hear anything else.

UI is decent, and the art is pretty pleasing to look at. My problem lies with the lack of UI feedback when taking damage. There is completely zero feedback on UI or screen to let you know you have taken damage, other than you manually eyeballing your HP  bar and noticing you are low on health. Words can also overlap into each other. Tutorial is pretty slim and not very well made but most of the game is pretty straightforward and easy to guess if you have played similar games before.

Crafting works as well as it should. It is easy to understand and functions like most other crafting games. There is a pretty decent selection of stuff to craft. It has tier unlocks similar to Satisfactory, which will let you craft better stuff and machinery.

Overall really if you are looking for a survival game this is decent enough because the survival part of the game is decent. The MMO / RPG part is quite underdeveloped, while I have not played enough to experience other parts such as the vehicles. Props go to the use of currents and elements to propel you and gliders (BOTW stuff), your character can also climb cliffs and hold onto things, which funnily enough you can hold on to the side of a large enemy, though you cant attack while doing so.

I am sure the game gets better both with time played and hopefully the devs work on this way more. For 20$ I would say its a good buy if you can handle the current state of the game.

Of course the wingsuit is a very nice item in the game. The way you you place platforms remind of Fortnite.

The game contains already a good amount of items, buildings and vehicles that can be unlocked. To unlock those you must reach new ages. And each age gives new items. Until now there are still some ages that need to be add by the makers.

Beside that your character could reach higher levels. Each level gives a point that you can use to unlock new abilities for your character.

Until now I only played the single player part. I have no experience in Multiplayer.

At start of the game you start on a little island. But there are many other islands to unlock. Each island has some dungeons. I tried the dungeons on the first island and one dungeon had enemies and one boss in it and in the other one I had to race on a hooverboard.

There is also a way to tame animals. But I did not have the chance to. There is also a wide mix of animals and monsters in this game.

I recommend Craftopia very much. There is so many to explore and to craft. Say goodbye to your real life with this game.

Multiplayer works well so far. We've only run into one bug where nanquest wouldn't complete but it isn't a big deal.

Graphics are bright and pleasant
The controls are easy enough and movement is very generous with gliding, swimming, and climbing all available at start
You can kill NPCs while they shout ""REGRET"" which is very satisfying

As far as negatives yes there are bugs and yes the developers have already addressed the translations. So far there hasn't been anything I couldn't figure out or if you've played games in the past you couldn't Intuit. I can see the game getting stale possibly after I've explored all the mechanics but I'm only 3 hours in and there is a lot still to see.

Overall I'd rate a 6/10 as is. IMHO it was released a little too early as there are several skills not yet implemented in the skill tree and a fair amount of bugs. But the graphics, amount of creative content, and overall fun I've had so far has made this a positive experience where I don't regret spending the money. As improvements are made it will only get better so hop in and enjoy with friends!

For now - Its very similar in single player to 'My time at Portia' without the focus on the NPC relationships, but having more freedom to explore craft and build.  There are elements of Stardew Valley, Satisfactory and Torchlight - and those are all positives.  Resource gathering is node based and there doesn't appear to be any terrain deformation at this time, base building snaps to a pre-set grid so no rotating stuff .  

I'm really looking forward to seeing how much this has to offer in its present incarnation but even more excited to see where the developers vision takes in six months to a year.

The graphics are something that really caught my attention and I'm loving it. I haven't experienced any sort of frame dropping or lag. The game is running really well and I can't wait to find out how far I can take it with building massive bases and farms.

I only found one thing that I kinda had a problem with and that was placing things down. First thing that happened was I placed the market stand on a hill (the hill is maybe at a 30 incline) and after it finished summoning itself, it did a failed back flip and landed on its backside.  Another thing that I experienced: I placed the evolution tower down on a hill and it started to bug out a bit and looked like it was on a trampoline, jumping up and down extremely fast. I just picked it up and placed it somewhere else to fix it, quite easy fix. It's not at all a huge issue, just a small thing I noticed during my time playing. Just knowing the things I place are in a slight angle is somewhat uncomfortable. 

I just hope that this game won't be abandoned by the devs. I'd love to see this game have DLC to add more things to make it last longer. Crossing my fingers.

Pros:
* The amount of content it has for a game that isn't fully finished is amazing
* The weapons, armor, food, etc.. are all very fun to grind for
* The way you can capture things and bring them back is a fun aspect as well
* This game will give you a Zelda vibe it's very fun and very relaxing

Cons:
* The combat is lack luster as of now
* The weapon fighting animations are clunky and not smooth
* The monsters feel like they have no brain to them at all that might change in other areas but I feel like it should be more challenging seeing as it is a survival game
* Lack of character customization i see the coming soon for some things but there still isn't a lot to customize with
* Climbing feels a little clunky as well i feel like you should be able to hold ""W"" and climb up but instead you have to jump over and over to climb

It's early access but still has enough to get your teeth into and decide whether you like the style of what the devs are doing.

You can likely get through the majority of the content in about ten to fifteen hours.

Visually appealing, solid game design, and plenty of space to grow. Pick it up if you want to support the devs, or if you're okay with watching this grow in your library.

Pros:
Great introduction of mechanics in the early game
Lots of options for a game at this stage
Multiple different play styles, each of which is supported (and aren't too heavily interlinked)
Mostly intuitive gameplay, with occasional pleasant surprises
Choice of body is independent of choice of gender (and more than two gender options)
Game systems implemented consistently across the different tools, crafting stations, etc
Lots of options for playstyle choice using classless character skills

Pros: 
- RPG mechanics, levels give you points to distribute into skills, 5 branches between basic, combat, magic, living and trickery (like a class very diverse, some buffs, debuffs, pets and vehicles skills).
- No class locking, can mix and match any skill tree, only requirement is the tiers, which require some amount of skill points spent in previous tiers.
- Crafting has tech levels, complex enough and entertaining to unlock, seems there's some automation an vehicles in the tech tree but haven't reached that far.
 
Cons:
- Combat system (at least the early one with a stick) is clunky.
- AI is way too simple, animals will roam around, will only run if you hit them, and stop running after a little while, monsters will go for you if you get close and that's it.

Downsides mostly include some weird graphical errors, poor translation, inventory management being a pain, and the general power curve of the upgrades going from ""wooden stick"" to ""automated robot with chainsaws for arms"" way quicker than I'd like. Enemy AI is also dumb as hell. More often than not, you'll miss enemies with ranged attacks because of their spastic and nonsensical movement behaviors.

-Different tiers of crafting based on the age you are in which is cool
-There is a simple quest system that helps you get the basics of it all pretty quick
-Music is nice to play to
-Skills galore! Life skills, Close combat skills, Magic skills and so on.
-I road on top of a bear and finished him with a flailing sword attack, MVP finisher

Cons:

-Balancing needs to happen on some skills/weapons maybe abilities to dodge etc would be nice to add in

-The degree of movement options, you can run, crouch, sprint, dodge roll, glide, cling to walls, climb, slow time in air (with bow skill)
-Combat animation is fluid
-Lots of crafting options, enjoyable crafting
-Art style, it is a fairly aesthetic game

The biggest issues I have identified:

-Bug fixing
-English translations
-Climbing needs to be more fluid
-Combat needs stun lock for enemies or enemies to telegraph attacks
-Crafting needs more options. It is varied, but I would love to see the system expanded

I was expecting a large open world, but it is more like several small instanced islands as part of a larger world. Similar to dragon quest builders 2. Not sure if they want to make this a single large open world game, but I would definitely appreciate a move in that direction.

Animations are clunky, there's a bunch of animations that lock you in place, too many mechanics to keep count...

1. theres are a few issues with translations but any type of language barrier is easily overcome by just figuring it out. the game isnt hard to figure out at all bulid this type of bench oh i need these types of resources to build theses items. not very hard.

2. the art design is a design that is very popular in japan dont complain about it its a japanese game what do you expect they are going to design the game with whats popular in their country. I for one like the art style

3. you have to play long enough to get to another island people are complaining about diversity of animals/enemies you will find that diversity but not on the first island. you can easily get to the another island within the first hour of game play.
in 3 hours i defeated 2 island bosses had a full set of armor and specialty weapons its not a hard games in the lower level islands. there are a ton of islands and a ton to do. there is a research portion of the game you have to gather certain resources to unlock new tech and it takes a bit of time but its not hard.

(im using a GTX 1060 3GB) i have had smooth performance the whole time! haven't dropped frames unless it's auto saving. As you progress it's like option overload! there's seriously that much to do in my opinion. 
This game is great to just put on some music of your own in the background and just play, chill, enjoy the journey. 

Pros: 
- Performance is great! (GTX 1060 3GB)
- Lots of skills already and more to be added (you can actually see what the soon to be added ones will do, so you're not left with empty promises) 
- Graphics (This is up to personal taste, but i like the graphics a lot, very BOTW) 
- Excellent controller support! 
- Nice steady progression
- Lots of different activities to do and missions to follow if you ever feel overloaded by the amount of things you can do.
- Devs are very active from what I've seen

Cons: 
- A few bugs but i haven't encountered any crazy bugs through my playthrough. (the worst bug i encountered was just when placing the campfire on a steep hill it went sideways, but i could just replace it and it was fine)
- Needs polish (not as much as you think though) 
- Controls on keyboard and mouse needs some time to adjust to as they can feel a bit strange at first. Using controller is seamless and easy though.

Combat needs a little work, but as you unlock skills to dodge and unlock better weapons things really kick off and combat becomes a bit more fun. So far I have progressed to the 3rd age in the game which is the games system for keeping you from crafting op items right off the bat. I personally love the way they went about this. In games such as Ark or Conan Exiles you have to unlock individual recipes one at a time. I much prefer finding resources to progress to anew age.

One thing most people don't seem to understand is this game literally just opened and it's early access not even close to finished. When a developer opens up a game for early access it is their way of asking you to support their adventure in building this game. It's easy to tell that the developers have put a lot of time and effort into this game and I have high hopes that they will bring this game to amazing heights! Just keep in mind there are some small annoyances such as dungeons seem to be a little taxing even on my 2080 super, combat needs some work, lots of the skills are not available yet, and finally my last minor annoyance the text not being translated. None of these issues really took from my experience or made me want to quit this game.

Overall my personal opinion is that this game is absolutely worth picking up! The developers started the games price at $22 upon release which I feel is spot on considering where the game is at currently. It's far from finished, however the potential and fun factor is totally here! I should also mention multiplayer is very clearly unstable, however if you don't just skip every bit of text that pops up on your screen immediately and actually read the opening message you'll clearly see that developers are aware of many of the issues I have mentioned and plan to fix them. To me this is a great sign that the developers are actually testing the game extensively and don't plan to release a bug filled game such as Ark for full retail price. 

I will end by saying this game will make you feel like you're playing like 20 different types of games all in one. A lot of people seem to hate this saying it's copying other games, however I think they have meshed these genres together very well. The best way to describe this game is Minecraft + Breath of the Wild + a bunch of additional elements from a few other genres. If you have a group of friends whom can never agree on  a game everyone wants to play, then I believe this game will be the absolute cure. If you're tired of every game being exactly the same, then pick up this game because it's a diamond in the rough.

i dont think there is a story? the missions they give you are like reccomended what to do like how minecraft does its intro stuff. says punch a tree, build X build Y make X stuff like that.
to progress in the game, and to go to different zones, you need resources to unlock an area and use a big stone slab to teleport to a new zone 

its visuals similar to breath of the wild zelda adding in crafting elements. there is nighttime but its pretty short and skeletons spawn similar to minecraft. you get a crafting table, you can make a furnace, and smithy to make armor and weapons and stuff. there is a hatter table that lets you make some hats. 

the weapons and tools have durability requires gold to fix, get more gold by selling stuff to market and it gets sold every 20 minutes or so up to like 6-7 items, i think supposed to be 20 but bugged for me i think. but it lasts a while and you will have enough gold to repair. the problem for repairing is that the max durability will fall unless you get a perfect repair which is really rare. doesnt matter too much early game since you progress fairly fast and upgrade items fairly quick

there are dungeons you can go into and fight through. the first dungeon is filled with goblin mobs and a golem boss at the end. i ended up using melee to get through the dungeon and bow+arrow combo for the golem, it has a weakness that using ranged helps a lot

there are different types of animals where you can get resources from, i find that the deer get quite annoying since they start hopping away at the speed of light so you need ranged to get them down or you will be chasing them for a while. sometimes enemies get stuck on a rock trying to run away. there are several different monsters so far. the first real monster like creature is this blue thing that if you hit it, it flies away like a baseball(pretty funny)

there is a pretty big skill system in the game that you can specialize in, you get a skill point every time you level up general, melee, magic, rogue, 
general spec you can focus on little self buffs, give you health/mana regen and jump higher, swim faster etc.
melee buffs your melee hits and ranged hits
magic buffs magical attacks and stuff, i dunno i havent unlocked this part of the skill tree yet
rogue spec not really sure about it yet didnt really look through it
pretty much wanna focus on general+melee or magic or rogue specs

resource gathering for metals are in tiers, and needs the previous tier in order to mine the next. so stone pick needed for iron ore, iron pick needed for silver ore etc. 

bgm is fine, i didnt turn it off yet so it got that going for it

ive been having fun so far. i would recommend this game, maybe not at current price. 

i got off to restart the game because i was facing a bug where i wasnt repairing my items correctly, occuring way after i initiated the action and the action bubble for it is not where its supposed to be

writing this review since there was a 700 mb update lel

Think of the game like a expanded on Breath of the Wild with a lot of side content and silly things you can work with. 20ish dollars is a pretty reasonable cost for a sandbox game where you can run around and act as goofy as can be. My only real concern is that the dev team take time to look over their assets for what may be really close to copywritten content; the team had stated that quite a few assets were purchased from stores and I've had to take a few glances early on with ""wait is that ITEM from GAME?""

Edit:

Hey so after reading the flood of reviews that came out around the same time my review did I would like to make the brief comment that I did not run into any of the bugs mentioned regarding translation, item wonky-ness, or enemies just ""poofing"" out of existence. I played the game in English and while the translations were a bit rough, which is pretty normal for international indie titles in their early stages, everything was easy enough to understand.",1599225194,1599231635,True,156,3,0.902687788009643555,0,True,False,True,76561197991019367,792,25,131,0,131,1599230279
19,75430337,english,"Gameplay is really relaxing and chill. Building needs work, wonky placement and not a whole lot of building components yet. Just wooden Walls, Ceilings and Floors. Combat is pretty funny, but definitely needs some work. Dungeon is fun, but only have done the first one. This game is like Minecraft + BOTW.

Crafting is pretty straight forward and easy. As you level up you can skill points thus able to get more skills. Some skills aren't in the game yet. Skill trees include Basic, Combat, Magic, Living, and Trick.

Translation needs a lot of work but they said that It will need work so I knew what I was buying.

Multiplayer as of yet isn't working or at least me and my friend couldn't get it to work.

Some Story, but translation of course makes it hard to follow, if at all.

Graphics are nice, could use some work with lighting and shadow, especially on your own buildings, they don't seem to cast a shadow, some do, some don't. Frames don't go up to 60, feels like 40-50.

Overall the game is pretty fun and chill to play, and as an early access game it's not too bad. Definitely worth a try.

*) Age of Empires

-Some Monster is a bit weird EX When you hit some Mono it go straight to sky
-Hit box item need to adjust like market you must try to find angle to access it (another must do like crafting table)
