There are plenty of servers nowadays, and playing Infantry or anything with friends is a blast. I got a key for this game on Origin a couple of months ago before it came back on Steam, and I decided to get this for £7 because getting all the DLC alongside it is such a steal. Of course there are probably more vanilla map servers than DLC servers but you'll see plenty of DLC servers.

30,Battlefield 4,77157153,english,"I played this back in the Xbox One days with the boys and it's just as good.

Pros of getting it now:

1: If you've played it before odds are it'll be a nostalgia trip and if you're still using the same Origin account you'll still have all your stuff and won't have to grind for any guns.

2: You'll get all the DLCs since the premium edition is the only edition on steam.  At the time of this review it's only $8 which is a hell of a deal if you consider the fact that this is EA we're talkin, and this is a Battlefield game with all it's DLCs.

Cons of getting it now:

1: There are no official servers for BF4 anymore so you'll have to scout around for what servers suit you.  Take that as you will.

2: Punkbuster is it's anticheat and is known to kick people for no reason.  If you go to steamapps/common/BF4/_Installer/punkbuster/redist and run pbsvc.exe and choose to uninstall it will make the game playable again.  This worked for me and a few others but keep in mind this is probably only one solution to this.

As for the player numbers, the last time I checked there were two thousand to three thousand players as a daily average on the PC version.  Not as many as back in BF4's golden age but you shouldn't have trouble finding a few conquest matches at near full capacity.

7.5/10, 10/10 if you count the fact that it's $8 right now.

- GAMEPLAY!!!! is where it will blow your mind. The destruction in this game and levelling of certain maps is incredible. I've never felt so immersed in a Battlefield game as you're always on edge and worried about your surroundings. You'll get some funny clips from this game when tanks randomly show up spamming at your building or a 64 infinity only seeing massive gunfights.
What makes me dislike the game sometimes is the gun clipping, sometimes you'll feel like non of your shots landed on the guy moments later you get 3 tapped. Along with the ridiculous jumping, it gives them an immunity to bullets cause the animation glitches out this is a exploit as really bugs me, you'll see sweaty players going 160 - 20 cause of it and they'll take 4 of you on cause they exploit the jumping mechanic and you'll have no chance or awareness where they will appear from.
Other than that weapons are fairly balanced, fun to use and alot of unlockables to gain when using the same weapon and class. Each class serves a great purpose turning the tide of the fight.

- Overall Battlefield 4 is one of my favourite BF’s in the series, the new ones feel lost and dont have the charm BF4 has, this was the last good BF game i got in my opinion. The other never really attracted me. Maybe it's because of the massive gun options and attachments. 
The servers are getting more and more active 
EU
AU 
US 
Are active and have dedicated players you'll see most days. It's like a big family. 

- For Aussie players like myself there are only 2 dedicated servers that are usually active around lunch time, mainly around dinner time.
One is Operation Locker the other is classic BF4 maps conquest

85,Battlefield 4,76996113,english,"IN CONGRESS, July 4, 1776.

The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America,

When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.

We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.–That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, –That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.–Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.

He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.
He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.
He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only. 
He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures. 
He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.
He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.
He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.
He has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers.
He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.
He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harrass our people, and eat out their substance.
He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.
He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power.
He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:
For Quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:
For protecting them, by a mock Trial, from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:
For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:
For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent: 
For depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury:
For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences
For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies:
For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:
For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.
He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.
He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people. 
He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.
He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands. 
He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.

In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.

Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our Brittish brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.

We, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do.

2,Battlefield 4,76960802,english,"I've now played Battlefield 4's campaign for 2h45m and I could not be less impressed given the studio that produced this game.

1. Regular glitches/bugs in cutscenes where pedestrians are driven-through by vehicles without any collision, rendering detail is an absolute crapshoot with even key characters having uniform detail that looks filled-in with crayon
2. Weapons in the campaign (guns, grenades, gadgets) will occasionally transform when interacted with. I went to pick up an assault rifle in the early Chinese extraction level (hotel) and it instantly transformed into an M67 frag grenade.
3. Your squad and other miscellaneous friendlies are, effectively, useless; they can't kill anything unless you specifically direct them to do so, despite game animations showing them both firing at and hitting a target with sustained fire for more than 30s... Blood spatter and everything, folks
4. While there is a ""Progression"" label on the weapon stat bar in the campaign along with multiple attachments showing for weapons, these are entirely irrelevant; there is no way in the campaign to alter any of the guns; you get what you get and you're just expected to like it. Funny point, here, the guns aren't even consistent in the campaign; I picked up a P90 that started with a toggle between a laser and a flashlight and then, with no explanation, the same P90 suddenly no longer had a flashlight but, instead, had a three-dot laser as its sole attachment

It was an absolute slog to get as far as I did in the campaign and even trying to play it as a joke game provided little in the way of a motivation to continue. This feels like it was put together by some amateur, start-up studio desperately trying to push out a single-player shooter to prove that they can at least stagger across the finish line in terms of game development.

INB4 ""no one buys Battlefield for the campaign""

if you are having a problem with punkbuster check guide

so don't get discouraged if you do get kicked

as of 30-09-2020
I have been kicked out of many games due high ping but its never like i cant join  again
join their Discord of the servers also, so you can make a appeal they mostly probably will unban you, I recommend that you do not use hacks especially in a country like India even if you want to for fun there are plenty other games for that,.... why i say that in this game you have no server  for India you may get permanently banned and may or may not be able to play again so don't do that to urself, otherwise your wise :)

No doubt the best battlefield game ever made.

The campaign was a bit lame but not the worst battlefield has had, the graphics still look great in 2020 and the multiplayer is really active. 
The amount of weapons in this game is really impressive and all the attachments and customization make them even more immersive.
This game has probably the best map designs out of all the battlefield games, and there is a lot of them(with dlc), and most importantly, this game has the best levolution, which really changes how the maps look and play and make the maps really dynamic. 
Sure this game has battle packs and pretty pricey dlc(not on steam though), however the game is not pay2win and the dlc are 100% worth it.

Favorite AR: ACE 23 or AEK 971. I have a soft spot for the AN94 due to BFBC2.
Favorite PDW: I don't have them all, but probably the CZE. The MP5 was a good one to get to the CZE.
Favorite LMG: How could I go with anything besides the AWS? Just kidding, I liked the Type 88 a lot, too.
Favorite Sniper Rifle: -
Favorite Shotgun: I am trying to get as many attachments for the Saiga 12 as I can.
Favorite Carbine: Probably the ACR, however I admit I don't play Carbines that much.

Pros:
-Ages well, still a lot of fun
-Lots of active community servers to choose from
-Very rewarding multiplayer system (Unlocks essentially)
-Mediocre campaign. Story's horrible, but it's fun to play through

Cons:
-A bit buggy considering this game is no longer in development. This includes swim physics in the campaign, not being able to see other players at times, etc.
-A lot of pieces that should not be bulletproof are bulletproof. Might as well not even try to shoot people through thin cover
-If you're like me and you suck at PvP (but still enjoy it), unlocks can take a long time to unlock
-Hackers are prelevant. It's up to the staff of community servers to detect and ban hackers
-Staff of community servers will sometimes kick you if you are ""too good"" or if they become salty towards you
-Uses Origin only, even if you purchase it off Steam.
-Never liked the idea of not using hitscan. The bullets travel slower than .22 bullets
-Bullets shoot from the barrel, not the reticle. This means that sometimes you will be shooting the crappy hitboxes of models when trying to kill someone
-Lots of models have crappy hitboxes
-Multiplayer maps, in my opinion, are quite lackluster. As a level designer myself I feel that I could've done a better job

I rag on this game a lot but I really do feel it is worth the play. It's one of those games that feel like it's being held by a thin string, but, is still quite fun and enjoyable.

64,Battlefield 4,74916016,english,"Singleplayer campaign is a feast of deja vu for us FPS lovers. Countless references and ""oh isn't that from ***"" moments to be discovered. A great FPS experience with NPC teammate support and multi-gadgeted weapons that are fun to use. Too bad we can't customize our weapon in SP campaign, but there are many to choice from.

Here's a list for reference that I discovered or I expected but not sure. There's even some movie reference if it wasn't mistaken.

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare trilogy (level, scene)
Call of Duty: Black Ops I & II (level, plot, character)
Titanfall (achievement)
Wolfenstein: The New Order (level)
Metal Gear: Phantom Pain (plot)

(Movie) Jarhead (level)
(Movie) The Shawshank Redemption (level, plot)

Some level design even reminded me of the alien created city center in XCOM 2, but maybe it's just I think too much;)

The plot is also good in my taste. There's always more possibility to be discovered other then the almost cliched ""permanent Russian enemy"" theory, although be aware Russians are still presented as enemy in this game. The severity of war is described adequately as well. There is of course some heroic moment that bullets just avoided our heros/heroin while they gunned down every single enemy in their way, but as the war progress our casualty was also large. This reminds me that war is a mutual harm of life that shouldn't be taken lightly, but when the need arise, someone has to do something to make things right. At least that's what I interpreted it anyway.

I can feel the love of developers, which I mean DICE mostly, when playing through the game. They surely are gamers like us and know what we want. Regarding their current situation, I just wish them well, and hope to see them making more games with such enthusiasm in the future.

BF4 is better than CS and COD and other weird wnb war games fps or fps with vehicles imo even if combined, squading and the gameplay (multiplayer) is just too epic on this one. Also BF4 is the last one of the franchise as a modern bf game by the time writing this (the newer releases are ww1 or ww2 or about something else old'ish) and even though this looks cooler than all the **** war games that cost big money now and are new ""AAA games"" this doesn't require a high end pc and it's not born to be laggy or broken or whatever, it's a great example of a great well done game. Not a total milsim like Arma but imo much better like this, I'm not even into Arma. It's Battlefield. You'll know if you get to play with a more regular squad and get to the tactics with tanks or choppers or on foot or in air or at sea or whatever... 

Totally recommended, best war game franchise ever imo and BF4 is my favorite of these (with BFBC2 which is simplier but hella funny)

If you're still getting punkbuster errors, what I did was uninstall Battlefield (Origin) and Punkbuster through Control Panel then restarted my computer. Then, I did a clean install of BF4 (Steam). Afterwards, I installed (through Even Balance) and opened up PBSetup (Punkbuster) and added BF4 through the directory that Steam uses which you can find by right clicking on BF4 in your Steam library then hovering over [i]Manage[/i] then [i]Browse local files[/i]. Finally, to make sure Punkbuster was working properly, I installed (through Even Balance) and ran pbsvc then clicked [i]Test Services[/i] which then a [i]Test completed successfully without error[/i] box should pop up which means you'll run Battlefield without getting kicked by Punkbuster. If that doesn't work, don't bother me. I'm not tech support.

As for the game, I mainly play on 3 to 5 servers that specifically range from Conquest Large (mostly focusing on maps that I believe are good for infantry like Zavod 311. Locker, Metro, Flood Zone, etc), Team Deathmatch, Rush (Normal & Hardcore) and rarely Obliteration. Even though I play the same maps almost all the time, I don't seem to get tired of it. It'd be preferential if I can at least find a half full Air Superiority server from time to time. If you live in North America, I find some servers to be pretty nicely populated between 5PM EST and 8/10PM EST.

I personally believe you get less reg if you fully spray your weapon, holding down M1.

49,Battlefield 4,75414656,english,"This game saved my life.

I am 27.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

81,Battlefield 4,75143332,english,"What can I say about Boyfriend 4?
It's a game about shooting, running, piloting, shooting, grenades, dying, people spawning behind you, spending a literal fucking ten minutes finding a lobby not full of hackers, basement virgins, or furries that won't ban you, dying, and shooting.

If you're not here for the multiplayer, you're here for the refund because this isn't a game for you Jhonny Singleplayer.

Don't get me wrong, the single player campapaign is great, but not because it's good. What is arguably the last good ""modern war"" campaign is also easily the most laughably hastily-assembled. The cutscenes are locked at a crisp 720p (likely Xbox One/Xbox 360 simultaneous development eating their ass whole) that often perform at a blazing 24fps if it isn't taking coffee breaks every two frames.
My PC was built two years after this game came out, so it's not the fucking hardware since I sometimes run this game while finishing my turn in Wargroove, so it's the game.
Another reason why I say it's the game: It doesn't load all the way. I don't mean ""hang time, that's right--we're chilling!"" I mean ""See what wall over there? Fuck you, it's gone now, so is half the level. Good luck progressing through that building without any stairs faggot.""
When I say the AI is bad I don't mean they only push me out of cover and are responsible for half my deaths from vehicles, I mean the non-vehicle AI is like fighting the Special Education department's students from your Elementary School. They often stand, or run in place waiting for you to murder them since that sometimes is necessary to progress.
They often shoot completely around you, and on hard mode their reaction time is slower than a noob with only one hand and one finger to operate both the mouse and keyboard.
Most of my screenshots of the game are showing either the AI or game blatantly fucking up, because that is what it excels in.
However, if you can get past that or play it on console, the story is superb and rides hot off the coattails of Boyfriend 3: The  One With Good Maps' story. You play as newly-Sergeant Rekker, which is a name in America I'm assuming since they kind of imply you're American despite the flavorful cast. You gain flavor and torture as the game progresses, and if the disappearing levels or wonky AI doesn't fuck you the story is nice. You'll prefer the live cutscenes over the loading screen ones, and it'll deliver something fun.
It won't be deep, for fuck's sake play Deus Ex if you wanted a deep-story from an FPS perspective, but it will be fun, and if you play multiplayer: rewarding.
Completing a certain score in a campaign gets you guns and stuff in multiplayer, you can make this easier on yourself by playing on the hardest difficulty, which isn't that hard anyways. I will spoil one thing in the sneakiest way possible, when choosing who you like least: If you like both just wait...something happens to reward your love for both characters--although I let Ming drop so I could get a P90.

While we’re on the subject of the campaign, let’s discuss a glowing, neon warning sign that should have been a wake-up call. What fucking smart ass named the black guy Irish and the Filipino Pac? All I do is call them Robocop's Friend and Mike Wazowski, since apparently the Filipino is Polish and I saw Monsters Inc a lot. Battlefield has always tried to be awkwardly “inclusive” with a strange, empty, hollow feeling of “we actually don’t care”, and this game is the last of it being believable.
To go further into EA/DICE’s history of doing this shit, In Battlefield 3's multiplayer Beta all multiplayer classes in the US Team were white, and no one really cared because we were to busy trying to kill eachother. I didn’t question that everyone on the Chinese teams were all Chinese and there weren’t any Mongolians, Koreans, or Russians. On the Russian teams you never heard anyone say there wasn’t enough Asians, but whatever, someone in the team said, “lets diversify US only”. The game released and suddenly Recon gets tanning advice from Donald Trump, and Assault got put in the oven for too long. I wouldn’t have any problem with it, and I wouldn’t mention it if these character didn’t actually look like caricature clowns made a day before the game released. It clearly wasn’t in the cards if the beta didn’t have this, so what inspired them to turn around? It’s also fairly obnoxious because they dropped it entirely in this game, realizing it was a mistake to let the PR group see skin color.
Now we're back to faceless Multiplayer Characters with ambiguous race but the same voice, but a campaign with characters whose names and faces don't make sense. It feels like in every Battlefield game someone from the Feelings Committee showed up and forced them to make last-minute ""diversity"" decisions in the final week of development and we're always left with a game that's almost good, but thank god they went out of their way for diversity. I feel like it was because of the decisions in this game specifically that we had the awful fucking trainwreck facefuck-fest of Battlefield 5 and 1.

Pandering aside, this is the last of the ""good"" Battlefields in my opinion. The stories in previous main and side installments were always fun, and seemed to focus on a plot rather than ""things that happened maybe"". After this game we lost consecutive story and were given snippets of something just barely OK. Characters in this game are memorable, and show depth despite some forced...flavor. I'm not saying I dislike diversity, I just dislike some asshead pandering and doling our fake and forced ""Diversity"". It's not the names, it's not the depiction, it feels very fake and forced at all compared to the other dialogue behind it that felt real and fun. 
This game and its successors are the video game equivalent of being Greek and every white person in the office coming to you to talk about My Big Fat Greek Wedding like they suddenly know you. Sure it’s a good movie, but if you watched it expecting an accurate depiction of Greeks to base your entire opinion and prejudice on, you’re not getting a complete experience. Instead if you’d rather enjoy a decent game with some shoehorned themes, you won’t be disappointed. There's a lot of stuff that we don't care about. not just because we play games, but because there is no genuine kindness or caring behind this gesture. You can tell whoever did it doesn't care about race either and it just feels bloated and sad, like a beached whale, and quite frankly it feels insulting that you're being subjected to it by someone who was paid, and apparently couldn't fucking care less.

As for Multiplayer, this is the last good Battlefield game, hands down.
I dislike and can't stand the lack of customization or memorable maps in either Battelfield 1 or 5. The entirety of my playtime in either game was spent ""preferring"" guns over others, and not feeling any motivation to unlock any of the limited inventory.
In this game there are maps maps maps that each have large, dynamic flow that change the course of the fight depending on who has advantage over what points, and what vehicles and strategies the teams are employing. Finding out what kind of gun you want to use is important, and each class can use four different categories guns. Once you figure out either which class, gun, or class of gun you want to use, you're set. There's a clear indicator at the bottom of each item what you need to do to unlock it, so you can look up in-game or online how to get that, and before the end of the hour you've gotten it.
I love this kind of progression because it truly allows players to explore and progress through multiplayer at their own discretion and pace--provided they don't mind playing campaign for some items.
For $50 or so you can rent your own server of 64 players, because Commander gay fam, which begs to question how much you play this game.

I think It's not like no servers to play (although with proper wording, can't properly play in servers without logged out of high ping). I propose one solution that has been working for me:

My average ping to all servers takes around 250ms, which will always get me kicked. But after 4 hours of gameplay, I realize that tickrates really affect my latency. I used to try so hard playing on as small as 60 tickrate servers and still kicked. My solution was looking for servers with lower tickrates, so far I have found 5 severs to play regularly with tickrates of 30-40Hz. Unfortunately, maps with DLCs don't usually run in low tickrates, but I found one with 40Hz. Nevertheless, I extremely enjoyed my time.

I was bummed out at first after purchasing BF4 and knowing it is almost impossible to play, it turns out I just didn't really tinker with the tickrates. I know, this is not the modest solution that solves all problem and allows you to play in every server. I'm still bottlenecked by my phone tethering internet speed, there's no cable ISPs reaching my home. I am still looking for a way to reduce the ping packet size so i have a smaller latency. Please drop a solution if you have one ;)

Unlike many of the other FPS games on Steam I own, BL4, is low strategy/high shooting.  The games are fast paced and if you are so inclined allow you to spend a very large part of your time right in the thick of battle.  The realism may be lacking, but the graphics are great.
One of the great things about purchasing this game is that many of the maps from BF3 have been ported to the multiplayer servers, which adds tremendous variety to the experience.  The multiplayer servers are usually easy to join and the player environment is easy going and friendly.

[i] Updated: August 25, 2020 [/i]

For players who live in Asia: I would not recommend this game for you but I have some solutions to this. There are only few Asian servers running (mostly 5-10). This is because Asian servers are being plagued by DDOS attackers and until now, it is still prevalent. You can find some Asian servers but it will be later attacked by DDOS. Pray that you may finish a match. If you are located at SEA, you can join in AU/NZ servers but be wary that you need 150ms or lower latency to avoid being kicked. If you are located at Middle East or Central Asia, try connecting to US servers and find a server that doesn't have pingenforcer. Then, if you aren't kicked, put it in your favorite server lists.

Before starting to play this, you need to install Punkbuster (there are now tons of reviews saying that). After downloading this game, add this game in the Punkbuster by locating the game directory. Next, if you don't have Origin account, create one. Next, download the DLC's, which is the Community Operation, Legacy Operation and Night Operation.

DO NOT USE THE IN-GAME SERVER BROWSER TO PLAY. You will encounter bugs there (and will not be fixed because EA). Instead, use Battlelog in your browser. It seems inconvenient at first but you will get used to it. Battlelog is used traditionally in BF4 for a long time and it is widely accepted as a better one than the in-game. Next, add Better Battlelog and True Player Count browser add-ons (optional). After doing all of that, enjoy!

Overall, this is an amazing game.

Side note: If you want to grind weapons, kits and xp, play 24/7 Locker or Metro servers. It's a clusterfck but fun. Do campaigns and re-do the last mission 3 times with different choices (spoiler). There are weapon unlocks (P90 is ridiculously good).

[h2] For Completionists [/h2]

This game is not for you (or if you want a challenge, you can try). If you think you can unlock all weapons and attachments, you will need lots of time and dedication (and requires you to buy previous Battlefield titles). This game has achievement or unlocking feature called ""Assignments"". These assignments can reward you dogtags, weapons and skins. Given that this game is in ""Premium"", you can technically complete all of them but there is a catch. Some of them are super hard or near impossible to accomplish. Let me give you some examples:

[b] Not the Weakest Link [/b]
- Reward: MPX
- Link 10 points in Chain Link gamemode.
- Level of difficulty: Hard. Rarely, there are few servers that has Chain Link gamemode.

[b] Recoil Kinetics [/b]
- Reward: Deagle
- Get 20 headshots with Unica 6.
- Prerequisite: Big Splash (Unica 6 Assignment)
- Level of difficulty: Very Hard. It's easy if you can find pistol-only servers that don't restrict revolvers.

[b] Eagle's Nest [/b]
- Reward: Gol Magnum (best sniper rifle)
- In a round, get 5 kills while you are in Caspian Border or Firestorm towers.
- Level of Difficulty: Very Hard. You need to study the bullet projectiles of sniper rifle. Then, find a server that has Second Assault maps (sometimes rare). And then, be the first team in the tower (or fight for it).

[b] Eyes in the Sky [/b]
- Reward: UCAV (best gadget)
- You need 1 Air Superiority Ribbon and 3 Jet Fighter ribbon.
- Level of Difficulty: Next to Impossible. Air superiority servers are SUPER RARE. But not only that. YOU NEED TO LEARN HOW TO FLY which is hard. Never underestimate pilots in this game.

[b] Phantom Trainee [/b]
- Reward: Phantom Camo. This is one of three assignments to unlock the Phantom Bow (you can get it for free in Operation: Outbreak map)
- Prerequisite: ARG Game (search how to unlock Phantom Assignments in YT)
- 200 kills with Pistol; 20 kills with jet; 2 shotgun ribbons
- Level of Difficulty: Next to Impossible... unless you learnt how to fly.

[i] This one is more of a rant [/i]
[b] Ultimate Commander [/b]
- Reward: Ultimate Commander dogtag (best dogtag in my opinion)
- Difficulty: LITERALLY 1st RUNNER UP TO IMPOSSIBLE. YOU KNOW WHY?! THERE ARE 2 VERY VERY HARD PREREQUISITES:
- By My Command. Ok... get 10 commander resupply ribbons. EZ. And then get 10 commander leadership ribbons... ok... ez... wait... WHY ARE MY SQUAD LEADERS NOT ACCEPTING MY ORDER?! THEY ARE NOT FOLLOWING MY ORDERS!!!
- Offensive Commander. Deploy 50 gunships. Gonna take me a while but not that hard... Designate 10 HVT. Ez. Kill 30 enemies using cruise missile... wtf... well... not that impossible... I just need to ask my enemies to stand still.
- After that, you may now access the easier tasks which are: 100 Scan assists; 100 EMP assists; Promote 75 squads; 50 ammo drops used; 25 vehicle drops used (PLS FFS USE THEM. IS THAT EVEN HARD?! THIS COSTED ME ENTIRE COMMANDER POINTS THAT I EARNED)

There are more hard assignments in this game that I can mention but this review is getting long. I only listed the hardest of the hard assignments. Good luck completing them all.

I have both origin and steam accounts and naturally thought it wouldnt be a big deal to buy this on the steam platform considering that the majority of my games are on my steam library minus battlefield 1 on origin. This may have been a mistake...

I cannot launch battlefield 4 without it giving me prompts of failing to link steam and origin accounts to play the game and i have do this series of troubleshooting steps every single time i play the game. EVERY SINGLE TIME. I have family share disabled, display scaling at 100% and i found the solving step is to switch between wifi networks before and after launching the application. Absolutely ridiculous considering i can launch battlefield 1 from origin with no issues and all my steam games normally. If its not the connecting accounts issue i get an issue of a cloud sync that is failing to take place from origin playing battlefield 4, but not on battlefield 1... in other words, i only have issues with my only game that requires syncing to 2 accounts for access. I would have much rather have bought it on origin than steam as today is the first day all my troubleshooting steps i am aware of have not worked. Very unnecessary.

You can shoot a jet with 100 rounds of 6.5mm minigun and hardly do any damage to it. Jets just float if you decide to jump out of them mid air and slowly descend to the ground (really bad cheesy mechanics). People love to literally afk and shoot UAVs across the map to kill people. If you want a guaranteed win, play this game with 1 or 2 friends and its basically impossible to lose if you have communication in this anarchist game with no flow to it. People appear out of the air while respawning and parachute down all around you even on an objective that you own. Parachutes can be opened if you jump 1 ft off the ground, totally negating any need for planning or skill and allowing all the button spamming freaks to run around in their arcade game. Even hardcore servers are a joke, everyone that looks down their scope glows with a bright spotlight, if you have a laser on your weapon enemies see a bright red light when looking in your general direction. Full of max level (140) losers that sit in base using UAV's, perma flying little bird helis with miniguns and no matter how many times you think you are shooting them directing in the face your bullets will not connect and will be ""deflected"" by the glass on the heli or whatever this game thinks is preventing my bullet from connecting. Joined a 30 ping server and have 18 ping while playing, playing hardcore server, conquest not rush, STILL SUCKS.


Just play Battlefield Vietnam or 1942.

Oh and one more thing...

Bullets go straight through people even though you have 20 ping. But other people can shoot you through walls/chunks of concrete. Honestly cant tell if the game just functions that poorly or if there is an issue syncing objects. 

Buy it if you can get it for -$10- free and want to get killed by spawn campers, people with fully customized weapons and much better gear than you until you spend 50+ hours farming exp and trying to get to a decent level to unlock and get rid of the super mega trash garbage poo weapons that you get in the beginning with iron sights.

72,Battlefield 4,74506958,english,"My Background, what makes me relevant to talk about the issues with this game?:
I have played a ton of games on steam, I have 1,600+ hours on TF2 and over 1000+ on GMOD, I play overwatch and CSGO, as well as PUBG and R6, but in all the hours of play that I have attained I can safely say that Battlefield 4 is a horrible game. 

Positives:
The graphics are awesome but this game should never have been released to the public.

The issues that I encountered:
The campaign has many glitches from AI clipping through vehicles to the player being able to fall through the world. The game also encounters many errors in my experience. After 2 hours of playing the game would not load checkpoints and just sat loading. After 1 hour of trying to fix the game I closed it. Then it would not even start. I tried probably over 10+ different fixes, and after another 1 hour, to no avail the game seemed unable to launch. I had worries at the start too! Originally it would not start up, but after I reinstalled the game it seemed to start again, but reinstalling a game every time you want to play it is not a winning strategy tbh. I would not recommend Battlefield 4 in any way shape or form.

Summary: 
In all my years of gaming,  I have to say that I am more disappointed that Steam would allow a game like Battlefield 4 to be allowed on their platform, I use steam a-ton, and I believe that steam sells quality games, and that when I buy a game from Steam weather that be from a small developer in his apartment or a triple A game studio, I know that when its on steam that the game has a kind of unwritten quality to it. Overall I'm disappointed about the game that clearly had very little bug tests and glitch tests performed on it, but I am as I said, more disappointed that steam would let this kind of crap onto their platform.

What am I doing now?:
Currently as I write I have submitted a refund request with Steam, and I hope that this game will be refunded. Though considering that they say that they may not refund games that have 2+ hours on them worries me. I probably play a good 2 hours on BF4, 1 hour on the start screen just trying to load it (which I fixed by reinstalling the game again), and 2 hours on bug fixing and eventually giving up and requesting the refund.

What I hope happens:
I hope that this review helps some people, I do not mean to diswade people from buying this game, but rather inform them on what may occur if they buy it. I also hope that Steam removes this game from their store, but I doubt they will, and I also hope that I get refunded my money, because to be honest if I had to sum this entire experience up in one word I would use the word, disappointing.

Once you actually manage to get in to the fucking thing you are greeted with grenade and launcher spam, campers on every fucking building (even on large conquest maps, dont even get me started with rush) and shooting that is so incosistent that  makes you wonder if the killing your enemy is based on a fucking DICE roll. I dont know what they did with whatever is affecting the shooting but difference with BF4 and BF3 is night and day. Which is real shame because fell of the weapons is really good and it feels so satisfying to shoot from them. But all that falls down once you actually get in the game and start shooting the enemy bastards. It never feels like you are actually in control of the shooting and where as in BF3 most of the deaths felt earned in this game most of the time  it is not. You would think they would have worked on an amazing gunplay of the previous game but they throw all that down the toilet and came up with whatever this is.

BF3 had its problems with nade and explosive spam especially on certain maps where chokepoints would happen when playing Rush, but this game is on a different fucking level, especially since this game has a few more explosive gadgets and what not, half of the fucking maps are chokepoints. I seriously dont know how do people tolerate this, 10 out of 10 times it is a better option to let your teammates to push the objective and die like cannon fodder while you stand back and take potshots at the enemy team.

Yes, I know game is 7 years old and I just played it for the first time and it probably makes no sense to write a review but this frustrated me to a such a point that i had to write this shit review.

12,Battlefield 4,74471521,english,"I played this game for two straight hours: 1 hour on the campaign and 1 hour in multiplayer, and both were shoddy in different ways. 
To start, the campaign mode is fun for exactly 10 minutes until you get to a part where you must shoot down a helicopter with a grenade launcher before it blows up your car. It's a scripted quick-time event, which means everything slows down and you get about 4 seconds to line it up and fire. Unfortunately this section is bugged so the helicopter is invincible and can't be shot down no matter what. I tried about 10 times over and over again, and after about 30 minutes restarted the game, tried again, and saw it still didn't work. Apparently this is a problem for many other people, and considering this game has been out for years, you'd think they'd have fixed it. I'm sure the rest of the story mode is fun, but I guess I'll never know.
Multiplayer is mostly a personal preference thing. The graphics are beautiful and everything is nice and shiny and polished. That's all well and good until you figure out that it's pretty much impossible to see a dang thing among all this 4K chaos. Vehicles are alright but are an incredible annoyance to deal with and just aren't fun to use or fight against. Sure you can stick a bunch of C4 to the back of an enemy tank, but that's the extent of your survivability besides tank mines or something. 
Essentially I just walked around for an hour getting periodically shot in the back or blown up by a helicopter. I got one nice kill with a shotgun because I managed to actually sneak up on a dude, but that was it.
I don't know what the big deal is about this game, I don't know why people like it so much, and I definitely don't know why the story mode is completely and obviously broken. Maybe I just hate video games nowadays or something.

48,Battlefield 4,74426675,english,"Had this game on Origin for a long time but I bought it on Steam to review it.

Despite being 7 years old, the graphics on this game look incredibly competitive to modern shooters nowadays. Added onto the fact it's got an insane list of guns, maps, easter eggs as well as tasks to do to unlock MORE guns and gadgets it's got a pretty good life-span, hence why players nowadays still love to work towards the Phantom Prospect assignment.

However, because this game is atleast 7 years old by now it's hard to find servers that have enough varied content for you to experience NEARLY the ""entirety"" of BF4 multiplayer.

I can recommend Rush servers to new players as there's less vehicles that r*pe you on spawn and in general it's a decent way to explore the maps and shoot people long range.

You can also go on hugely packed Lockers servers to practice and refine your aim, though be aware you'll most likely only die to AEK-971 players.

Movement on this game is also hit or miss. Personally I like it, it has the best flowing movement I've seen in any shooting game to this day; though it can be abused quite a bit by ""bunnies""; those who love to spam jump frequently around corners and mess their hitboxes up a tad bit.

Land, air, and sea combat is quite good as well; though once you unlock FLIR optics for each vehicle it's pretty much game over for any infantry trying to hide away from you, quite a bit overpowered in other words.",1597616369,1597616369,TRUE,1,0,0.523809552,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,179,10,3310,685,6,1602082859

I have on origin Battlefield 3, Battlefield 4, Battlefield 1, Battlefield 5, together with many other games. All paid for. Last 18 months or so, they just would not function on Origin. Woul;d not start, connection and erropr problems everywhere. No problem with computer, whatsoever.
I noticed that Steam was offering B4, B3, B1, B5 to play on Steam.
With Steam having not been a problem with maintaining and updating their games in the past, I made the decision to purchase these games on Steam, hoping that I would no longer have the crap that I have had to put up with on Origin.
Sorry to say that this has not worked out for me as I had hoped. Battlefield 3 and battlefield  4 are a nightmare still to get operating, not to mention the continuous crashing and miss functioning within the games.
I had hoped buying for a second time on Steam that my problems would be solved. let us face it,guys and gals, EA and it's front Operating system ORIGIN are nothing but CRAP. Add to the fact that on Steam, you not only have to have Steam in operation to play but the whole bag of Origin shit as well.

Most importantly the matchmaking doesn't work, every time I queue in for matchmaking it says ""matchmaking failed : cannot find a suitable match. try again later"" and try using the server browser and i always get kicked by admins due to high ping. I tried fixing the issues myself and checked around, but it didnt work and it seems that no body has a fix for this. Horrible port to steam.

ALSO : DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IF YOU ARE IN THE ASIAN REGION. SERVERS ARE REALLY RARE TO FIND AND THESE CHINESE MOFOS JUST DDOS IT EVERYTIME. Blaming myself, i have a decent connection but these servers are so far that I just naturally get a higher ping and the admins just kick me out and its understandable. But, EA isnt fixing this problem at all. They, instead just shut down all the official servers and now you cant even play them in this day and age. Probably because they want people to desperately play BF5. 
I cant even ask for a refund now that my play time has exceeded. I feel so bad right now because now this game will just lie there in dust .

The campaign is lackluster and buggy.

I played this a bit on console when it first came out and grabbed it on Steam when I saw a good sale. Note, you will need to download Origin to play.

Pros:
- Excellent graphics and generally good production quality
- Plenty of multiplayer servers available (as of Aug 2020)
- Fast paced, well-done multiplayer that is still alive and well
- Huge variety of guns, gadgets, vehicles, and customization options
- Plenty of ways to play with many multiplayer game types

Cons:
- Single player is short, cliche, and really phoned in
- Huge amount of bugs in single player
- Have to download Origin (I don't care about this, but some do)
- Official multiplayer servers are down
- Some issues with cover and objects: like objects being in the way even though you can't see them; not being able to climb over things you'd think you'd be able to climb over; getting stuck on small objects on the ground

For me Story and content hinges on playability in gamIng, I need the feeling of exploration, surprise, and to experience the narrative unerringly with a planned level of frustration and rewards that only a well thought out game can deliver.  
Indeed the bridge scene pre the airport was unbelievably gripping. 
Up until meeting the glitch at the dam I was well on the way to laud BF4 in my top 5, but after the 60th attempt at the same simple terrain point I’ve dropped it in the proverbial where it belongs. I understand my FPS skills are marginal to say the least but I still expect to finish the story which would have led me to assume I could attempt the multiplayer, probably to my often sudden realisation that I should have stayed in the single player campaign.

Most games provide means to increase FOV, it's unacceptable that BF4 does not. So it's a thumbs down  from me. I probably should get a refund, but not sure if I can since it was part of a bundle.

As for the player base there is a healthy player population and I'd recommend buying BF4 over BF3 for this reason alone unless the BF3 campaign and coop mode (assuming you can find someone to actually play in that coop) is your thing. This version of BF4 uses the same desktop application to browse through games that BF5 and BF1 use which is quite the upgrade as opposed to launching the game from the website thus not having to deal with various internet browser problems. 

Battlefield 3 still uses the internet browser to launch the game which is not ideal as it takes longer to actually join a multiplayer session so again that's another reason to choose BF4 over BF3.

Hurray for the Steam release! More players the better. Long live BF4!

The game is absolutely awesome the multiplayer modes are so fun. The issue i have are the servers,or lack thereof. I can surely recommend this game to someone from US or EU but me personally as someone from India am getting 200-600 ping and i have got autokicked multiple time.In the server browser it shows a minimum of 600 ms ping but it varies once you join in so you have to check ping on each diff servers. There was no indication except these reviews that the servers are down and only after i booted up into the game. The official servers are are shut down and the remaining ones are the third party rented servers which have different rules etc. I wish the official servers were still up idk what to do really :( 
NEVER GET THIS GAME OFF SALE i do not know why price has shot up after EA came to steam they are really just scum!
The main gamemodes still active are conquest large,domination,gunmaster which are not much of an issue but this server thing causes a sense of fear in me i hate ea i wish they just ran the beautiful game DICE made as it was

Edit - I decided to just play this game cause i ran it over the 2 hrs and tbh bf4 is just amazingly nostalgic fun. The servers are getting kinda annoying though auto kick for ping and some admins kick for no reason and some have different rules which could be cool.

Vehicles are still stupidly strong, always have been. Progression is not a problem. Only  negative things I can think of is the fact that conquest is the only populated gamemode, that some DLC maps are played very little and  some servers use 3rd party software to inflate the current players, this is easily seen through by a sound mind since there are small hints that give it away, just favorite some good servers and you are ready to go until the next battlefield comes out.

For me it feels like nothing has changed. Also have to add that everything is like 2x XP now which makes unlocking previously hard tasks somewhat easier. 

Punkbuster is not a pain in the cheek anymore and the server browser is easy to navigate.

Its still the best Battlefield after Bad Company 2. After this began the decline in gameplay quality and fun, this is also the only battlefield that is actually enjoyable solo in my opinion, playing a game this much in one sitting is quite special in my case. 

I can't recommend this game enough, people that cry about veterans shrecking noobs are kind dumb in my opinion, that happened since day one and makes it all the more juicy when you finally take down a guy that has not left his heli for half an hour.

11,Battlefield 4,74110305,english,"TL:DR; Come for the multiplayer, stay for the multiplayer, play the campaign when you get around to it. 

BF4’s multiplayer is pretty similar to other entries but actually closer to Planetside than anything else (if you somehow played that but not this). What I mean by that is that it’s got fun gunplay, a mix of classes for teamplay, vehicular combat, and many of the same issues. BF4 is concerned with making a spectacle and a pseudo “realistic” combat experience (note, it’s not a sim). That means when a vehicle or shotgun or whatever decides to doody all over your face then you just gotta deal with that, go watch some irl combat footage found on fallen insurgents if you wanna see how an AK vs Abrams engagement is “supposed” to go. This forces you to learn to play around certain threats rather than being equipped to deal with everything you meet at all times. Skilled play lets you reduce the cheese you encounter but you gotta remember that when you pick this game up you’re agreeing to sometimes come face to face with an air to ground heli that your team is too stupid to do anything about. Nut up and deal with it or switch servers, either are valid responses. 

The campaign is fine. Definitely melodramatic and honestly eye rollingly up it’s own ass at times but sorta endearing in it’s earnest attempt to be “[b]cinematic[/b]”. It’s also absurdly easy. So much so that playing on hard is almost mandatory. You’re not going to encounter any revolutionary gameplay mechanics, you won’t find nuanced storytelling or any significant player choice but you will find a fun shooting gallery with an engaging enough framing device to keep you wondering what scripted event or cutscene will happen next. Plus, making a thinly veiled CCP the villain of the week is actually far more topical in 2020 (also when the game is set) than it was in 2013 and dare I say a refreshing break from blasting random Russian dudes-oh wait, they managed to fit some of them into the line of fire too (still mostly use the Chinese models though lol). All in all, if you’re an uber nationalist American then you’ll climax every few seconds from the sheer amount of unadulterated USA military might presented, if you’re someone who doesn’t really care about that then you’ll enjoy the shooting gallery/change of scenery, and if you’re from China then… well I think it’s still banned there (and if you’re Russian then I think you’re used to this sort of thing by now and are given your token good guy). 

All of this sounds pretty negative but it’s hard to relay the sentiment, “it feels good to shoot dudes in the face” in many ways other than what I just said. Pick it up on sale and blast some baddies.

Addendum: I almost forgot that the game’s post processing is migraine inducing. It’s a shame too because during some loading times when changing settings/opening pause screens you can see what the game looks like without the filters and it’s great! Consider using reshade or, if you have a compatible GPU, use Nvidia filter settings to counteract the game’s. I use the following Nvidia settings but you probably need to tweak things for your setup/monitor:

31,Battlefield 4,70795732,english,"  This game was and is still absolute trash, it has been since launch. There are a very good aspects about it but for the most part it was a complete downgrade from 3 as well as previous games of the series that came before it. I'm very much aware this is an unpopular opinion amongst those that still play this series.

Pros:
-Vehicle skins, weapon skins, more attachments for weapons, Chinese faction (obviously opinion for that will vary but I'm glad it's not just Merikkka vs RU), Naval Assault

Cons:
-Map design, lack of cover, terrible spawn placements, bad hit detection/reg, awful weapon balancing, suppression system, cartoony visuals (obviously subjective), story is buggy and shit (again obviously subjective), at the moment low population which is to be expected of an old game but for Rush and TDM there is only about 6 servers up at any given time, many just replay the same map over and over (sad naval assault is pretty much dead, it seemed really good)

   Now that I have stated those let me explain why I view it that way, you may not agree and that's fine, good on you if you can overlook those things. The maps withing this game are pretty to look at and I feel that was all that was intended or thought about within the design process because the flow of gameplay generally ends up being a cluster fuck everywhere. On some maps you have people parachuting to roofs and camping there with no way for the other team to get there aside from also parachuting to them (Dawnbreaker, Shanghai in Rush), while other maps lack cover needed to move up or defend well (Zavod, Hanian resort in Rush), a lot of maps will also have very terrible spawning locations especially in TDM even when safer areas are available it will often spawn you with an enemy already in range or behind you. Many maps also have terrible chokepoints that become extremely difficult to break through, usually because lack of cover and often people will say ""UsE sMoKe"" but these areas will often be small unbreakable doorways such as those on the map Operation Locker, or Guilin Peaks. These things are prominent within most maps but these are just the examples I could think of at the time of writing this.

   Weapon balancing in this game is a joke, you have some guns which are decent but then you have those like the SAR that just suck with a low fire rate as well as damage and on the other hand you'll have a gun like the AEK which has a super fast fire rate and high damage output. I get it is a game and difficult to balance everything but the AEK has been overpowered in 3 as well as this game, perhaps the fire rates are similar in real life but for the purpose of it being a video game they should have put a bit more effort into this or just not have guns that will be way better or too weak. The hit detection also seems very similar to games like Black Ops where you can shoot a guy standing completely stationary yet not hit or actually hit but get like 20+ hit marks, I'm not sure if it is from the suppression system or perhaps ping though I didn't have the issue in Bad Company 2 or BF3.

  For those interested in the story it's a bit short, your fireteam is rather annoying aside from Hannah, it's buggy and sometimes crashes or an NPC you have to kill falls through the map so you have to restart from last checkpoint.

  Perhaps you will enjoy this game if you love Conquest but they put little to no effort in for the other gamemodes and it really shows, as someone that prefers Rush I can't recommend this game, it's just not that enjoyable on any of the maps. If BF3 still has a playerbase I would just get that.",1592167265,1596653292,FALSE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,135,52,4591,0,3594,1598581498

43,Battlefield 4,73652285,english,"I sincerely don't recommend this game for multiplayer 
here are my reasons for it 

1st of all things the official servers are already closed down by ea (bcs they want you to buy bf5)
so when your official servers are down then why even bother selling your game especially at its original price as it
was back in 2013-14 it makes no sense
since on steam you can only buy premium edition that means you will definitely play multiplayer 
in fact most people are only buying to play its multiplayer and not single player
but nowhere is it highlighted or told in the game description or anywhere that the official servers have been shut down
i think this is stealing by showing the customer improper and selective information 
why arent you giving us all the details about your product when you are selling it advertising as ""premium"" or ""ultimate"" edition and selling it at sky high prices 

2nd that there are lack of asian servers 
its very hard to find a server that's close to your country if you are outside of europe & usa 
theres only team deathmatch servers running and thats not exactly the core of the game 
you dont want to play tdm with just 6 more players in this game
modes like conquest, rush, capture the flag and many more dont even have servers in asia
and if you want to play those modes you have to go in european or american servers where your ping will always be above 180 to 200 and with that much high ping you wont be able to enjoy this game there will be too much lag and you wont be able to focus at just about anything 

3rd point is that the admins of some servers are complete ret@rds and i seriously mean it 
i have been till now banned on 3 servers without any actual fault of my own 
1st server i killed the admin 4-5 times(i didnt know that he was an admin) from a helicopter and he burst into anger by writing abuses to me and then banned me 
i was like WTF ! 
how can someone have the power to ban you from the server ? even if hes an admin 
sure he has rented the servers from ea but that doesnt give him the right to ban players without any reason 
2nd i was banned almost immediately upon entering since i killed a player with a c4 
so there are some servers which have special rules like you cant kill from this gun this grenade this equipment or whatever
and if you do you get banned
3rd i got banned bcs the admin said that hes only going to allow players who are noobs or average 
seriously what in the fu cking hell is going with this game 
i dont understand the need for banning
why ban ? you can just kick the player out for a time being but having the power to ban from the server makes no sense
that would not be a big deal for me if the official servers had been up
but the official servers are down and then i got banned from rented servers too
so where the hell do i go now ?
i was really really p!ssed off by this 
you dont like someone just ban him from the server 
i cant even do something about this 
only power to ban should be with the anti cheat system
that is if you are using cheats you should get banned immediately and getting on that 
the anti cheat punkbuster doesnt work properly too
it kicks you out of the game randomly and does not detect real cheaters
i have been killed by cheaters in this game who can be easily detected as walling and using aimbots but no punkbuster instead creates problems for me instead of them 
so yeah what a great experience i had in playing bf4 multiplayer 
official servers are down there are no servers near my country and i get banned for stupid reasons in rented servers too 

why is there no review/appealing system for banning players from servers ?
it should be reformed into a kick system at the very best if you really want to stop others(for whatever reasons) from playing in your servers 
banning players for no reason should not be allowed and these servers should be taken down along with their admins

why are the official servers closed and yet the game is still being sold for its original price ? 
this is straight up stealing , you are advertising the product as ""premium"" yet you cant even use its contents 
its like selling a table but hiding that it does not have any legs or stands 
so its totally ineffective 

the answer is that ea does not give a damn about their player base and would do nothing about these issues
so when ea doesn't care about us then why should we care about their games

Personally I feel this game is best when played with friends and I figure that is why I couldn't really get into it on console. Punkbuster is annoying and I've seen others get banned for things they did not do. Luckily if you get the message saying ""Kicked by Punkbuster"" its a fairly easy one time fix (Unless you are banned of course). All in all, I really love this game and I've put at least 100 hours on console and a good 850ish on PC. I recently bought it on Steam so I could centralize my games. A word of advice I have is be careful when playing multiplayer on a Punkbuster-enabled server while running any programs that could be flagged down by Punkbuster (I've heard cases of things like Torrent programs getting people banned). Also be aware that once you link an EA account with Steam that its currently impossible to unlink it without first getting help from EA's customer support (Which in my opinion is atrocious).

85,Battlefield 4,73184457,english,"It's a good game, but here's the issue. The campaign is short and the ai sucks. When you play on hard the friendly ai becomes autistic and can't hit anything while the enemy ai becomes bullet spongey as hell. I can't tell you how many times I died to someone throwing a flashbang because every single enemy throws one. 
The graphics and sound design are great, but that doesn't make up for the bad ai and artificial difficulty. I was disappointed because I played this on my old 360 and I don't remember it being this bad. Not to mention the amount of glitches with the world and the ai itself. At least 2 or 3 ai will sit somewhere and not move when your being attacked. The script just stops working for them so you have to go and look for the ai to finish the level. 
Now multiplayer. 
Multiplayer isn't bad, but not many people play it as much as they used to. 
I honestly can't recommend it which is sad because it's considered one of the better battlefield games next to battlefield 1. 
I found a gamebreaking bug on the level that you need to swim through the ship.

96,Battlefield 4,73116910,english,"7 years later, the multiplayer is still heavily populated, which proves my point that if you fix broken games with potential, people will come back and play it for years to come (unlike the new COD MW and BFV, which are super fun sometimes, but also super frustrating most of the time, with the developers having 0 intent to fix the frustrating elements).  While Battlefield 3 and before had awful netcode plus 10hz servers, DICE after Battlefield 4's bad launch decided to finally fix the netcode that plagued the game, which to this day has one of the best netcodes of any multiplayer shooter (Playing on European servers on BF4 with 100 ping is somehow a better experience than playing US servers on COD MW that are near my house).

It feels like the developers actually played Battlefield 2 before making this game, unlike Battlefield 3, and Battlefield V with Battlefield 1942.  From Battlefield 3, the game adds voice chat, 5 player squads, commander mode, and three factions instead of two, reminiscent of Battlefield 2 (They even re-added Dragon Valley).  While the newer Battlefield games are alot more casual than Battlefield 2, this game IMO has a good mix where the solo player experience is enjoyable, but playing as a coordinated squad can singlehandedly win games.

I would actually get this on Origin if possible, since the price is usually cheaper, you can add it to steam in order to use the Steam Overlay, and you can use the web server browser to join games instead of the ingame UI (which is horrible since servers can now spoof playercounts).

34,Battlefield 4,72767011,english,"For a seven year old game that has had three sequels Battlefield 4 is surprisingly alive in the Australian/OCE community, often there are 2-3 fully populated servers and a couple half empty with some running all the DLC (which you get from the Steam purchase) or just running classic maps. So the game is definitely not dead and still playable.

Content wise, at the price I bought it at $20 AUD, it gave me 60 odd hours of gameplay on top of the many more hours I've had on Xbox 360 and Xbox One (1300 hours roughly) and it hardly gets stale, I would honestly keep playing if it wasn't for the two elephants in the room.

As a new player and reliving that experience now, there are some fields that you will be at a heavy disadvantage as a newbie, vehicle gameplay heavily relies on using ECM/Active Protection and not having it is basically shooting yourself in the foot. On the contrary infantry gameplay as a new player is not difficult, the starting weapons are decent, although some are a bit weird to grasp at first (U-100). Due to the permanent 2x XP I recommend not buying the shortcut bundle because it is easy to get all weapons/vehicle upgrades within 40 hours of gameplay. 

So with all the positive points done, lets get on to those aforementioned two negatives:

The first elephant is the community, being a seven year old game there are some veterans of the game who cannot fathom that a new player (or returning player) is not 100% perfect in their actions and will easily shit-talk in chat or in voice communications. It is really sad to attempt to help a player to only be called a f***** and be told to f*** off when trying to repair their vehicle. On the flip-side, if you are doing well, you are obviously a hacker and prepare to receive constant abuse thrown at you. This abuse is above the basic salt after being killed and evolves further in trolling/griefing.

The second elephant in the room is the lack-luster anti-cheat systems in the game. The official system is punkbuster/fairfight, once you get fair fight banned the signature of your cheat is recorded and if another player uses the exact same cheat that player will be banned. The only significant issue with this system is that if the script is slightly changed, it produces a new signature and one can get around the system, it's not effective at all. I visited a cheat forum and learned that the only thing needed to change a signature was to rename methods and variables to be unique.

The second system is BF4DB which is a statistics based/manual report platform. Players can offer admins evidence of hackers to get them banned or the statistics of a player can show indication of scripts. There are two issues I have experience with this: (1) some hacks will never be caught in their statistics, like fire rate hacks or wall hacks is hard to detect with this system (after witnessing a cheat like this, and going to their clean BF4DB page there was no evidence of it apart from a high KD ratio) and (2) a players stats can be heavily skewed if they join:
- Modded servers (SPM, Damage, KPM and KD ratio are affected)
- Hardcore servers (Damage, KPM and KD ratio are affected)
- Boosting servers (all statistics, depending on what a player needs to grind)
- Locker/Metro servers (Accuracy and KPM)

BF4DB is not perfect in my experience in dealing with hackers and it can't be without being invasive but my experience with both the community and the cheaters has given me less fun with this game.",1594872225,1594872225,FALSE,48,2,0.732623458,7,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,123,38,4510,0,4159,1599740754

What can I say about this game? 
It's PERFECT. I remember playing it on PS3 like 6 years ago and having same fun as now. Bf4 was so good that even DICE couldn’t make a sequel. Btw servers are still alive after 7 years. at least in South America.  10/10

Que puedo decir de este juego?
Es PERFECTO. Recuerdo jugarlo en la PS3 hace 6 años y divertirme tanto como ahora. Bf4 fue tan bueno que ni DICE pudo hacer una secuela. Por otro lado, los servidores siguen vivos después de 7 años, al menos en América del Sur.  10/10",1594320706,1594320706,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,147,15,3522,0,169,1596156358
7,Battlefield 4,72374746,english,"So it's not like I'm not having fun with the game. I'm sure I'll probably play multiplayer and that will be fine. I'll probably slog through the campaign too (and boy is it a fucking slog, more on that later) and it'll be fine. 

 The last Battlefield game I played the crap out of was 3. It was amazing. The campaign was not great but it was serviceable as a tutorial and felt good to play despite not being the main draw. It did it's job.
Battlefield 4 saw the devs (or let's be real, the coked up yuppies at EA) just not even finish most of it. It seems like they got a series of levels pasted together and didn't bother with even the most basic of tuning. They added a bunch of lens flare (Christ, the lens flare) and said ""it looks great, people are only playing it for the multiplayer anyway."" but they neglected SO FU(KING MUCH stuff that parts of it feel like I'm playing a Digital Homicide game.  Stuff you can't kill until the scripted event starts, levels that are basically rail shooters, other stuff I can't quite remember, but I remember cringing away from the screen quite a bit.  Like I said, only parts of it feel that way, but I've always considered Battlefield to be the standard of quality for FPS games period. That's why this was such a shock to me, I guess.  

And this is only how I feel about the game itself. I haven't even gotten to the steam ""migration"" port. It's really bad. It's very bad. I don't really know much about what I should be blaming on the porting process and what is jank left over from release, but I'll go over a thing or two that doesn't SEEM like it was in the final release of the console/origin release and IS in the steam release: There are game breaking bugs that require a restart on each level I have played so far. Most are scripted events that don't trigger, one was my own incompetence.   I have to assume that the guy saying ""GIVE ME A TARGET"" is a bug because there's no way that made it through testing without people killing themselves. There's a lot of times I just died and had to immediately restart a scene. Before you tell me to get good, one of the times was on the beach and I just fucking immediately died. I didn't get a chance to get my weapon out just POW...merc'd.  There are a LOT of times where it feels like the GAME is killing you not the enemies (either a bug or a really bad balancing issue) like, if you aren't going the right way or venture into a different part of the level you just get one shotted. I know it's not an exploration game, but dawg I was just trying to flank, not go for a stroll. 

Anyway. 

It't a good  multiplayer game, like you'd expect. But the campaign is VERY far below standard and the port is just trash. I hope they fix it, but I know they won't. I'm pretty glad I got it on sale. I wouldn't recommend it otherwise.",1594311459,1594311459,FALSE,3,0,0.483956337,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,1042,66,277,0,251,1594597657

80,Battlefield 4,71997238,english,"Before you get this game, make sure you have PunkBuster installed! You cant play multiplayer without it. After installing the latest version, simply add BF4 into it. Now on to the review. 

This game has to be one of the best grand scale multiplayer FPS games I've played in a while. The gunplay is really nice and satisfying when you get kills or assist your team in capturing an objective. The progression system even incentivizes more gameplay and to try out new weapons and tactics. Team play is paramount to ensure victory. There are also steep but rewarding learning curves for piloting aerial vehicles and sniping. 

However, if you planned to get this game purely for the single player campaign, then you will surely be disappointed. The campaign is a buggy and unfinished mess with a story you find on any C list action film with very 1 dimensional characters. 
The only upside to playing the campaign are the weapons you unlock for multiplayer, which are fantastic by the way, and the ability to gun down PLA soldiers. As a local and resident of Hong Kong, it brings me great pleasure to mow down hordes of commie bastards and hear them wail in agony in their mother tongue as they draw their last breath. Take THAT, Pooh Bear. 

Battlefield 4 also has an abundance of loot boxes. These loot boxes can be bought or earned with gameplay, which lock certain crucial weapon attachments behind them. I hate loot boxes and I shall never support them as they are a horrible and unethical business practice. 

The customization menu has been removed from the in game UI and placed on a website. How stupid.

Overall, despite the shoddy singleplayer and lootboxes, I still recommend getting this game ONLY at discount price. The amount of content you get on the Steam version seriously trumps the Origin version as you get EVERYTHING for half price. On top of that, you get one seriously fun and engaging multiplayer experience.",1593840365,1593845080,TRUE,31,6,0.777077556,4,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,125,12,2212,0,1424,1600528159

Pros:
- Fun with friends
- Still servers up
- ACE CQB
- Vehicle gameplay is fun when you are coordinating with your gunner/driver
- The MBT's are just as fun as I remembered!
- Heli gameplay is ok, but there are people who have a lot of experience doing this one thing who will knock you out of the sky in an instant.


Cons:
- All servers are third party, DICE servers are practically non-existent which leads to a lot of bruised egos and annoying communities
- About the community. You'll meet some amazing people, but there are a lot of toxic elements who ruin the game. They are pretty much the average neckbeard.
- Gunplay. I'm, really torn on this one. Sometimes it's very crisp and smooth and others it feels like I'm shooting rubber bullets. In addition to this, it feels like the gun is jamming. Never had this happen on console, but at the same time I wasn't able to spam my LMB at targets.
- ACE CQB

71,Battlefield 4,71636943,english,"For those having Punkbuster kicking you out of server problems like I had, there are a bunch of guides on steam to fix this and It worked out well for me. So before you play multiplayer, go to the user guides for this game and get yourself oriented with it first.

Anyways, Battlefield has always been (At least, to me) a better mutliplayer game than single player. Call of Duty is the other way around for me. Each of the two series has opposite problems but overall, I have always liked Battlefield because it involves skill and not luck like Modern Warfare or Black Ops does.

So how is Battlefield 4? It's a huge sprawling mutliplayer game that I'm really getting into again after a few years. I had this game on Origin and enjoyed playing it but now that I've come back I realised I am not only better at the game than I was before, but this is probably my favourite Battlefield game DICE has made.

I'm still ranking up in this game as I'm on Level 6/Rank 6, but so far, I love using most of the weapons and unlocking them. The Bolt Action Sniper you start with in Recon class really had me getting lots of kills and enjoying how the game feels. People are not trying to do stupid No Scoping techniques or rushing into battle getting themselves killed and none of the people are really mic spamming like in COD, Battlefield 4 has a good community that knows what tactics to use and when to fight. Suppression is huge in this game and becomes a great tactic to intimidate players to move back from objectives which is absolutely great. 

The best part I feel is you don't even need to kill people in order to be good at Battlefield 4, Suppressing Fire, Kill Assists, Capturing Points, it all gives you points and at the end of the game you get ranked with Ribbons and all that. You don't need to kill one single person in order to get good which makes it very accessible for those new to Multiplayer shooters.

But how is the campaign? It's surprisingly better than I thought it was originally. Although it's incredibly glitchy and DICE probably will never fix these bugs, the campaign is surprisingly really good. I really enjoyed the banter of your military buddies and the guns felt very impactful and it feels like a war zone out there. Also, it's way different than fighting Bad Guy Russians in COD Campaigns, you actually fight the Chinese at one point in this game and it feels very refreshing. If there was one thing I can give Battlefield's campaigns, their characters are more in depth and more likeable than in recent COD Games. Even in Battlefield V from what I played the characters are really good. So I do recommend this campaign in particular but be aware it's buggy.

If you like Battlefield, the multiplayer in this is a no brainer. I am having a very fun time with this game and I love leveling up my multiplayer character and earning new weapons and ribbons. If you are curious about the campaign, I say go for it. You might end up really liking it. It's better than most of the recent COD Campaigns nowadays and it was certainly better than Ghosts when it came out.

Overall, I like it. Beautiful graphics that still hold up, solid gameplay, lots of customization, good community so far from what I've seen, big maps to explore and a campaign that is actually quite good.",1593420555,1593420555,TRUE,1,0,0.521739125,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,817,121,282,0,282,1593419625

- That being said I am disappointed owners did not get a steam key. There is not really an excuse, It uses Origin to launch anyways and keeps progress, But no just because you'd 
rather play it on your preferred platform you gotta pay for that.
- Also on a side note this game has very little active servers, I only bought it because I saw a youtube video where a guy was saying that it has been reborn, This really is not true. There is enough players KIND OF, But you'll be stuck to only playing certain maps or modes so goodbye to any hope of completing some challenges. (I did not have it installed anymore on Origin and my internet is very slow 128Kbps Rural connection so it was sort of more worth it to just download on steam anyways, I don't regret it really but it does kinda feel like wasted money, If you already own it.

Pros:
-The game offers a huge and diverse way to customize your solider-from 4 different types of weapons (The class gun, Carbine, DMR, and Shotgun), as well as customization for attachments on primary and secondary weapons-not to mention equipment. This also goes for vehicle equipment customization perfect for what role you want for your vehicle (and solider) to have in the battlefield.
-Single player is pretty good, action packed and decently long.
-Map design is incredible-large and immersive maps make it fun and give it a realistic touch to it.
-$19.99 for the entire game + DLC. not to mention free battlepacks.
-Servers are still very active, making it easy to find a game.

Cons:
-You need to donwload punkbuster for you to play multiplayer. Cool thing is, is that it's very very easy and quick to download-took me about 5 min. There are guides as well to show you how to download it.  
-You have to download Origin Launcher as well/make an account if you do not have one. But who cares.

Reviewers claim issues with Punkbuster, when I was installing BF4 I've gotten the Punkbuster installation prompt, so maybe this got fixed (there are still tutorials if it's not fixed).

I am very disappointed in both EA for doing that and Valve for allowing this in many games - forcing players to use third-party launchers. Some games like GTA V have an abridged version of a launcher, but BF4 uses a full version of Origin. Why? Why do we have to have an account on the Origin, Uplay, Rockstar Social Club etc. etc. to play a game which is being sold on Steam already? The revenue share argument is no longer valid because the game is being sold over Steam so Valve is taking the cut anyway. Some titles have cross-play no matter what platform it's on.

The game is great, hence the positive review. Not sure about the price, I'm think that already discounted £20.00 is too much for a 7 year old game, which have been for free a few times in the past.

But:
For the amount of money it cost to make this game, the campaign is really sloppy. All of the things that were never tweaked or reworked break the 4th wall a LOT. 
You play as a commanding officer who is completely silent. So, instead of writing dialogue for the main character, he just gets orders barked at him by one of his men. Your character doesn't need a voice because he has no thoughts or feelings about anything. The longer you go into the campaign the more glaring the problem becomes. It seems for the cost of production, couldn't they have had oh... anyone in the military give the script a read? The Player is the leader of a special ops team that ought to be in the Special Olympics.
The friendly AI is keyboard-snapping dumb to the point that you are fighting alone. They run in front of bullets (and rockets lol) and will continue to shoot the same wall that the last remaining enemy is behind until you decide to go handle it and get on with the game. 
The enemy AI also has magic powers. You have to complete the task the way the game wants you to or you will die. Repeatedly. Until you learn your lesson.
Your tank is destroyed but you can reach an area where the enemy tanks can't follow? Too bad. You're blowing up those tanks before we get back to the mission at hand.

- Community's still groovin, Plenty of people in Australia from what i can tell, a few full servers, pretty epic.
- Campaign is still a good play through if you're bored :)

[h1] READ IF YOU NEED HELP WITH PUNKBUSTER[/h1]
Go to the official punkbuster website by looking up “punkbuster website” then download the client for windows or whatever you have. Go through the download process and when its done, open it up and click on “add game.” Make sure BF4 is installed or it might not work, but once you add it boom! Issue fixed. That took like what, 2 minutes? For those who wrote lazy reviews you could’ve spent your time actually trying to fix it quickly. Any other questions just comment on my profile. (Can’t link punkbuster website cause it’ll get removed)

Edit: There apparently is an issue where your punkbuster will not download the update, I aswell as others I talked to did not have this issue so I do not know how to fix it. I recommend doing research and if I find a solution I will add it above. The only possible solution I can think of is completely uninstalling punkbuster than manually reinstalling it, but yet this is not guarenteed to work.

[h1] OTHER INFO [/h1]
1. Yes, you need to install origin. But does that really matter? It’s 20$ for BF4 + ALL DLCS. (You also get 61 battle packs if you care, at least I did) It took me no longer than 3 god damn minutes to setup origin, you don’t even need to use it afterwards! Just launch it through steam, both platforms are linked anyway.

2. Yes the game is still extremely active despite its age. (For users outside of North America and Europe, do some research on BF4 playcounts in your areas. They may be significantly lower). You will have NO problem finding a full 64 player match. DLC maps you might have an issue with as most are not as popular. Most popular servers are Conquest Large on base maps. Don’t go for quick play and immediately go for the server browser. I personally have not found a server that lied to be about its playercount but if you do just test out all the servers and favorite legit ones so you can find them later, that’s what ide do.

3. System requirements size lies to you, the game takes up roughly 51GB instead of 30GB as they basically just mashed the DLCs into the premium edition.

4. “Should I buy the Ultimate Shortcu-“ [b] N O [/b] Waste of money. You’re literally paying half the price of the game to unlock some gadgets earlier. Also get the other free DLC, basically just more maps to mess around with.

5. “Should I buy this game?” [b] YES [/b] The multiplayer makes up 90% of the experience and its a damn amazing one. I bet many would agree with me. But be warned, if you’ve never played battlefield your first few games will be hell but once you get used to it its all good. I recommend only running campaign if you got spare time or are achievement hunting. Don’t get me wrong its not a bad campaign by any means but its nothing breathtaking either.

6. ""Should I buy this if I already have it on Origin?"" [b] NO. [/b] Steam and Origin users can play together and see the same servers. I also saw a user state in the comments that all DLCs will be given away on Origin for free at some point. Unless you have spare cash that you have absolutely nothing else to spend on, do not buy it on steam if you already have it on Origin.

Anyways, I was reading through the reviews and it is getting bombed by people who have, in all honesty, simple issues with their anti-cheat program (PB - Punkbuster) but that can be solved very easily by visiting PB website and downloading their PB Setup and reinstalling thus repairing/updating the AC of the game.
Now the game itself is truly amazing, even by today's technical standards.

Now singleplayer campaign is a familiar FPS cliche that uses the 2007's Modern Warfare template and formula in a way, with story line that you will forget in no time, sadly. 
The action is set in 2020, six years after the events of Battlefield 3. The story arc follows a single squad, Tombstone, as the U.S. becomes embroiled in a war with a militaristic faction of the Chinese government. Russia and the U.S. have been fighting for six years, but war with China is imminent because of a spat with Admiral Chang, the main foe, who plans to overthrow China’s government and support the Russians in the war with the U.S.
But all that does not compensate for the impossibility of sending back the grenades, the characters without charisma, the very flat scenario, or the successful artistic direction but too generic. Even the presence of three different endings falls completely flat since they depend on only one final choice, and the difference between each of them is roughly limited to the three lines of dialog following the decision. a simple white circle indicating for example the presence of an interactive zone.

And that's alright because this game is played cause of it's amazing multiplayer aspect, while also being able to compete with 64 players and fluently on huge, magnificent, partially destructible, vehicle or infantry only maps.
DICE pushed the limit of FPS genre by creating one amazing physics engine with the concept of Levolution on any map and that combined with various weapons and vehicles gives this game that ""all out war"" feeling that will surely keep you entertained.
Commander mode is there but since this is, after all a fairly old title of 7 years now, not many are using this feature.
Now I know that the graphics and physics aspect of any game is important as is in this one but certain maps are done in such a way that DICE devs never really accounted for another team to be trapped. One of those maps that I played a lot of is OP Locker. It's a great map with and interesting design in mind with snowy environment and snow storms on the outside of the facility but either team can easily become basetrapped and then you have to rely on active admins or server enabled scripts to initiate a so called ""nuke"" feature so that dominant team backs off from the last objective that is nearest to the base.

Like in any FPS game where reflexes and attention to the minimap and your surroundings is vital for you and your team, so is the cheating problem.
FF (FairFight) and PB ( Punkbuster) work in a combo, one is client side and other is serversided, statistical checking and screenshot validation, checking for wallhacks, etc. I would like to add that there is also an independent team of mods and admins who are in control of BF4DB site where suspected cheater can also be reported with sufficient evidence and every case is thoroughly reviewed. 
Even with these three people still manage to creep around with their hacks and get banned by AC or BF4DB or active admins on a server. With that in mind it is important to find a good server with active admins, preferably an active, larger community that runs servers in this game and play there.

Battlefield 4 Premium on Steam is a nice addition although I think it is a bit late, players are very active and playerbase is still fairly large, certain maps are played more than others so keep that in mind when hoping for some action on certain maps. Locker and Metro are absolute favorites atm and most player congregate and play on those maps.
Cheating issue is present, like in any FPS game, but can be avoided by playing on famous, community supported servers with active staff/admins.

Servers vary in so called ""tickrates"" - Server come in various tick rates,  30Hz ~ 60Hz ~ 120 Hz
*Tick rate refers to the amount of times a server performs gameplay-related calculations each second. With a Battlefield server, one of the many calculations performed during each tick is hit detection; this is usually what people are referring to when they complain about tick rate.

It's important not to confuse this with the update rate, which is the amount of times a server sends gameplay information (updates) to your client each second. There is also a command rate, which is inversely, how often your client sends its information (commands) to the server.

At the time of it's release it's main competitor was Call of Duty: Ghosts. DICE has had their fair share of issues with this release and EA didn't make it any easier for them at the time of release.
If you want to experience some solid FPS actrion which is set in modern time and which is different than CoD in a way, then give this game a try. Expect explosions, random hit detection on 30Hz servers, some salt from enemy teams and even teammates, 140 levels, 4 classes with various weapons and attachments, many vehicles, etc.
After almost 7 years ( 4000 hours spent in game) and various issues that plagued this game from it's less glorious start, I still play it and always return to it, heck this must be the first game I install when I finish building a new PC or when formatting a fresh Windows.

*P.S I already owned a copy on Origin client, so I didn't know what will happen once I buy the Steam version of the same game. 
Once purchased and downloaded (41 GB or so) the Steam client will ask you to connect your existing Origin account, if you have one ofc, and then once it connects the Steam and Origin accounts you will have a Battlefield 4 Steam version of the game in your Origin client. Neato. 
The stats/emblems and all the unlocks/ranks that you had on Origin version of the game will be transferred and connected to the Steam version so there's that too.

39,Battlefield 4,70731964,english,"Oh how good it feels to be back
after playing BF4 both on PS4 and XBONE with roughly 400hrs between the two, I found myself missing the game and picked up a copy as soon as i heard it was on steam. finally. 
Now that being said, I've been seeing a lot of people complain that you've got to download both PunkBuster and Origin to play it, but let's be real here, if you're going to spend a minimum of $20 on a game on PC, you can suck it up and take the 3 minutes it takes to download both. And seriously if those 3 minutes it takes to download something really bug you so bad as to leave a bad review, maybe consider reviewing the gameplay instead of pissing in the wind. Reviews are here to review the game, not the things you've got to install with it. And on that note, on to gameplay!

Battlefield 4 offers some of the best large scale battles I've had the pleasure of taking part of, be it a gritty close combat fight in the halls of Locker, A fight in the skies of Giants of Karelia (sp?), or even a slog over a helicarrier as it rests in the comforts of Hanger 21, afterburners ready to fry anyone underneath. Now, this may be a personal preference that not everyone shares, but since i played the Red Faction as a kid, i have been an absolute glutton for environmental destruction, and the ability to collapse the tower on Shanghai STILL makes me smile like an idiot as the enemy team scrambles to jump off of it.

The Gunplay is pretty much what you'd expect from any multiplayer shooter, though the weapons can be changed to fit any situation you may need them for. With this i will say that it sucks to have thermal sights be unlocked exclusively through Battlepacks, but they give you a whole shitload at the start of the game. 

The Community is.. interesting for lack of a better word, i've seen the odd white supremacist (usually kicked for being and i uote: ""A Racist Cuck""), A very large amount of people with Anime Icons (Take em or leave em, they can be great or terrible), and lastly, the Furries. With Furries i treat them the same way i do when i see them in real life, avoid them. While in real life it's because i'd prefer not to talk to anyone who wants to fuck animals in the same way i prefer not to interact with racists, but here in battlefield I have another reason: If you see anyone with an icon that is furry porn or anything similar, run for the fucking hills because they'll fill you full of holes faster than a swiss cheese fetishist.

Furry Jokes aside, this is the only AAA FPS title that i can honestly and genuinely recommend buying right now, and if you're the type to bitch about having to install PB and the Origin Launcher, you're probably the same type of person to cry about getting spawn killed because you keep choosing to spawn on your surrounded teammate.

I love battlefield but the whole servers being run by admin are quite annoying.

I literally joined a server that said you will get banned if you use vehicles and or any type of launcher. Which is stupid.

On the other hand I seen alot of admins ban people for no reason just because they can. Their are already not that many servers, so if someone gets banned on multiple servers they become even more limited for what they can play.

I know some people like these operation locker 24/7 and gomund 24/7 servers but i cant stand them. The wise thing would be to avoid these servers, but they are always populated. I wanted to play on DLC maps along with vanilla maps but when i look for servers like those, they are low in numbers which is discouraging considering the dlc is good. SO ALL IN ALL im pretty much forced to join the Vanilla maps only server with stupid rules, or The server that bans just because they can.

SO I believed the safest route is to just refund the game and move elsewhere. I am a big battlefield fan but the fact servers run by admins only and no longer officials is a no for me. The admins have too much power. Some of ya'll like that but I definately dont. So I'll just wait for the newer battlefield game to come out. I also dont like BFV that much. IT was OK. I prefer modern battlefield and since its been so long, Its not as populated as it used to be.

For those who are enjoying the game, I am glad you can find some fun in it because it really is a good game. But as mentioned above, I just can't unfortunately.
