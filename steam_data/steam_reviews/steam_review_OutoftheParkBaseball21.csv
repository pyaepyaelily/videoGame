4,Out of the Park Baseball 21,74157759,english,"After 200 hours I have to say no.  There is just not enough innovation here to justify the increased monetization that has been brought on by the Perfect Team mode. To be fair I have the same criticism of most simulators, it seems like less of an attempt to provide a great game experience and more of a conduit to get you to part ways with your money.  And you can part ways with a lot of it and still not be successful. I have always held out the hope that the devs would take some of their newfound bounty and create a simulation experience that is visually tolerable, graphically this game is still worse than the original Nintendo.

OOTP 21 Shareholders Edition update 05/10/20.

Most of my recent hours have been spent passively in Perfect Team Mode. In a strange coincidence, after I wrote my original negative review I began experiencing some of the same problems that many others have discussed on here with file crashes and certain things on my interface not displaying properly. It will not even let me simulate a game anymore so I can watch the outcome! Additionally my Perfect Team - which had previously succeeded modestly posted seven consecutive losing seasons, and now my team is stuck in Gold Level against what I often considered to be inferior opponents who outperform otherwise considerably better teams. 

Help me do the math here OOTP. If I buy your game for $55 CAD, and I invest $220 CAD in to my team to go 77-86 for 7 consecutive seasons should I accept this as a reasonable outcome for my investment? Mind you I have no intention of making it to the Perfect Team bracket, I just expect the team that I have created to perform well at lesser levels. 

I doubt that I am alone here and I think ALOT of people have invested way more than they intended to in this game, far more than it is worth. But lets not sit here and pat the developers on the back, lets highlight the fact that players expect the product to show considerable advancement YOY especially with this rapacious game mode driving profits in ways that are not justified.

Sadly though, this years iteration is by far the buggiest version, and is borderline unplayable.

You want to look at a leagues player list? CTD ""out of memory"" (mind you I have 32 GB of RAM)

There is definitely a steep learning curve, but the tradeoff is you can design *every* aspect of your baseball league. Not just players, but teams, ""era-style"" of play, uniforms, logos, divisions, farm systems, end of season awards, stadiums, Hall of Fame voting - like literally everything.

On top of that, it generates, tracks, and archives very realistic stats and outcomes. Every stat you can think of. Can't say enough good things about this game.  In almost 40 years of playing baseball games on PC and platform, this is the most immersive game I've seen.

Not much refined since 19 that I first got though as a non baseball lover I managed to still really enjoy the depth of strategy to the game, I would compare it in a weird way to Europa Universalis in strategic level but could use some more metrics around merchandise, maybe the ability to tailor what is sold and certain ones doing better based on what fan base you have (maybe could have idk handsome players as a popularity element and having those sells more of shirts or something and maybe funny trait characters (limited amounts naturally and based on fame level) could sell bobble heads etc.

Could really do with a tick box for sex as well, to allow you to custom in female players and or a league to save them creating, but the Japanese pro womens' league and maybe the international teams would be enough for that. Would give a real challenge to mold those into teams that could play against male counterparts with maybe strong control etc no different to males but maybe less 'power' or something, and obviously less player base to draw on but can grow that.

Also would like a financial means to gain from challenging teams in other leagues, that winning a small series could boost the rep of your league and merch sales, plus some game sales, and then teams to choose to accept or decline based on a metric of your performance vs league rep vs their performance in their league.

79,Out of the Park Baseball 21,75067966,english,"This game is very fun. The details are great and I find it totally engrossing. I spend a ton of time just running it in the background while I do other things and it's fascinating to see just how well it mirrors the way the league work. I enjoy so much about it, it's basically the best roleplaying game I've ever played on PC.

The growing edge of OotP, however, is that the in-game simulations are extremely frustrating, sometimes to the point of being infuriating. This is because can't really affect the outcome of the games, but the game acts sort of like you do. For example, if you ""manage"" a game, you cannot direct your pitcher's pitch selection. So, you just watch your pitcher with great control walks 5 guys in a row because the computer has decided that this is a regression game. It sometimes feel like every time I manage a game, my star pitchers collapse, while the opposing pitcher goes 8 scoreless and turns all-stars into guys struggling to bat .200. (The engine sometimes goes through gymnastics to make pitchers regress. I got a freak pitcher who had something like 18 K/9 and 9 WAR on the season. Well, the next season he had a .502 BABIP _ON THE SEASON_. Why does he exist in the first place if the engine can't handle him? If the batter touched the ball it fell 50% of the time with a team behind him that led the league in defensive efficiency and was 4th in range?) Or how about the fact that every time I try to steal a base the opposing team does a pitch out? Or the fact that several times this season, they've picked off Miguel Sanó at first base, who I have set to literally NEVER run? What is he doing on first base? Sitting down on the base path so he can't get back in time? So maybe I'm just bad at the game and that's why it feels like I can build 100 win teams and every time I manage a game I lose. Or, maybe the simulation mode is just bad, since all the player is actually even allowed to do in when I'm ""playing"" the game is to let the game resolve situations, as we don't seem to have any meaningful effect on the game's outcomes. There are times when I feel like Billy Bean. 

Also, as a general, the player ratings for smaller teams are very bad. Since the developers have apparently never watched the Brewers or the Twins, they are just like: ""Byron Buxton? I guess I know he's fast. Gee, he must be one of those 'hit it on the ground and make infielders panic' types,"" which he most definitely isn't. Lastly, I wish there was a way to control player development differently. Like, for example, to give players certain things to focus on. Cleveland's Bieber, for example, added a cutter in 2020, which made him even harder to hit than previously. Never in all my time playing this game has a non-prospect player gotten better or added a pitch or anything. But I'd also really like to say: I want this guy to spend more time working on fielding than hitting, or I want this guy to work on developing his fourth pitch. And what about how Houston, Cleveland and Minnesota have been developing pitchers by picking them off trash heaps and fixing things up? If you *want* to do that, you have to just go in and edit the player. That's a shame. 

So, all-in-all, this game is highly recommended. But the manager/simulation mode is going to give me a stroke, and not just because I'm a bad loser. But because it needs a lot of work.",1598637872,1598637872,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,204,5,42042,348,37080,1601076453,,
80,Out of the Park Baseball 21,73599713,english,"Doesn't resemble baseball in the slightest. Almost 50 games into a season and am averaging giving up 15 runs a game and 4 errors. Doesn't matter what I do, simulate the game, play it out, let my starters pitch relief, everything I've tried has ended up in the same result. Beginning to think results are scripted. 

Animations are laughably bad sometimes. Runners will get on constantly because your 1st baseman will just hold the ball 2 feet from the bag waiting for the pitcher to run over to cover. Balls constantly go through the outfield wall for triples.

I really love sports titles too and was looking forward to this game. Spend hundreds of hours playing Madden and FIFA and always wanted something that was more focused on front-office work, and thought this would be it, but this game is fundamentally broken.


Final Edit: Gave up on this game for good and requested to have the license removed from my account. The problem seems to be that pitchers are horribly balanced. The solution seems to be to go into EVERY pitchers attributes and change them to allow more stamina and effectiveness. So, if you don't mind spending 15 hours self-programming this game, pick it up.

4,Out of the Park Baseball 21,73895600,english,"I've been playing OOTP since 2001 when I picked it up in a bargain bin at EBX when it was called ""Season TIcket Baseball"". If you don't own a copy and you love baseball, buy it. I've probably sank at least 10k + hours of my life into this series.  It's hands down the best baseball management sim out there, the only other game that comes close is MLB The Show's Franchise mode, another series I've been following for nearly 2 decades. OOTP 21 is much more detailed and stats driven and the timescale is more in decades rather than 10-20 seasons like in MLB The Show. 

One does not have to be a baseball statistician to enjoy this game, just read up on the strategies of Earl Weaver, Bill James, and Billy Beane and you should be able to manage a competent franchise. There are times when OOTP breaks the illusion and feels like a glorified spreadsheet, but it keeps sucking me back in. 

Perfect Mode is a huge reason why I keep playing this game. It's kind of like baseball Pokemon and fantasy baseball rolled into one. You start off with 6 packs, you organize your finds, build a team, and earn currency in the form of PP as you win and earn achievements, for example if your pitcher throws a Maddox, you earn 400 PPs. You can purchase more baseball packs or bid on or buy players on the auction market. It's a really well-developed mode. In the future, I'd like to see injuries (infrequent and not like in OOTP single player campaigns), trades, and being able to manage your team in real-time.

The biggest problem with this game is that I can't adjust your game strategy as thoroughly as I would like. For example, I would like to be able to tell certain players to always take a 3-1 pitch. Well, you can't do that. Another problem is that I would like access to lifetime playoff stats including fielding. I would also like to see in game stats before I buy a player, OOTP hides that information for some reason. I like getting ""fresh"" players too, Oftentimes, you will see that the previous owner of a player will have used them...I hate that. And for chrissakes, will you let us track a player's lifetime playoff stats? Come on, this is basic stuff.

It drives me nuts that there is no financial information on each player card, so if you want to know what you paid for AJ Pollock or how you acquired him, you have to sort through your transactions menu, which will balloon to 200+ pages after a month of playing. Finally, I was really pissed off to see pop-up ads when I start up the game. Stop that shit.

I highly recommend this game. If you are a baseball nut and have the patience to learn how to play this game, then definitely pick this game up.

9,Out of the Park Baseball 21,74312342,english,"This is the first version of OOTP that I've tried, so I can't speak to what improvements they have or haven't made vs. previous iterations. But I'll just talk about my experiences with this version as a first-time player.

First, this is basically a hardcore text-based sim with some graphics to jazz it up. There is an in-game mode with 3D graphics that lets you watch the players play, but it's pretty rudimentary and looks like something out of the 90's - it's obviously not the focus of the game. You also aren't playing directly, but at best acting as manager in these situations. So don't go into this expecting a PC version of MLB The Show.

But what you will get is an incredibly deep simulation of everything else about baseball, from dealing with player contracts to hiring minor league personnel to promoting and demoting players, dealing with injuries, setting ticket prices and so, so much more. There is more here than I ever even knew existed in baseball itself, and I have been a baseball fan for decades. It is honestly overwhelming at first, and I wasn't sure I'd be able to get into the game because I just didn't understand half the stuff in it. It even has overseas leagues included! Follow along with the Japan League if you want (or even play in it!).

I still don't understand how certain things work - for example, ""slots"" when drafting new players, which seems to have something to do with the bonus money you're allowed to spend. Luckily you can turn stuff like that off, or in most cases just have the AI handle it. I try to handle most things myself, but I have at least turned on AI promoting and demoting in the minors, since otherwise it's just too much to go through the many, many layers of your minor league system (way more than I knew about!) and keep close enough tabs on the hundreds of players you have at any given time to develop them properly.

I've played through a couple of seasons now and am at 68 hours. That should tell you about how long it *can* take to simulate a single season, although if you let the AI handle more than I do *and* you don't meddle quite as much constantly trying to improve your team, it can be a lot quicker. I will tell you, though, that it's maddening when you have a group of guys who should be tearing up the league and find you're 12-22 in the early part of the season - you're going to sit there poring through the stats trying to figure out what's going wrong and how you can fix it. And you can spend hours upon hours doing this. And don't even get me started on when those injuries start piling up! Depending on the injury duration, who you've got in the minors and how many minor league options they've got, and who's available outside your team, it can take a while to figure out how to handle those.

That was the situation in my last season and it turns out the main problem (other than injuries) was a lack of leadership in my clubhouse! I didn't even think to check this until one of my players sent me an email telling me he wanted off the team because nobody was stepping up. Sure enough, I checked my player personalities and all I had were a bunch of sheep. I ended up trading two of my regulars in 1:1 swaps for guys with similar abilities but also leadership qualities, and from that point on I was about 20 games over .500. Unfortunately, I lost the last wild card slot on the final day of the season, which was infuriating! But that's why you're probably not going to just click to sim an entire season, and will spend a lot of time tweaking your team throughout the season and then either keeping it together or rebuilding it in the offseason. The offseason is just as big a part of this game and takes as much or more time to work on as the season itself.

The game actually keeps track of how accurate its simulations are vs. historical records and stats, and it's been pretty close for me. That said, there are a few areas where I feel like the realism breaks down a little bit.

First, it seems very easy to game the AI in trades. This is a problem a lot of baseball games have. You can very easily ""trade up"", doing a 1:1 swap as I mentioned above for guys that are slightly better than what you had, often for less money. Do this a few times and you can go from a borderline bench player to an all-star pretty quickly. You can almost always even get the team you're trading with to throw in a couple of prospects too, and/or continue paying a portion of the main mark's salary. Often the AI teams will be obviously trying to dump salary, so almost anybody with a $30 million contract will be easily available, no matter the age or importance to the team... and you can often then just ask the original team to retain 90% of that contract and they will! If not that much, then at least a significant amount (50% is pretty common) that makes the acquisition a bargain for the five-star player you're getting.

The only time it's hard to trade is when you yourself are looking to dump salary on older players. Often you'll get no takers at *any* price, even if you *do* offer to retain a portion of the contract. But this is realistic.

Second, this may just be my perception but I feel like there are some big problems with the realism of the ""live"" game simulations vs. the regular quick sim. It doesn't seem like it's simming the same way and the results are often weird. For example, my team almost always strikes out 10-15 times per ""live"" game even against total scrub pitchers - this does not happen if I just do a quick sim from the menu. Also, the other team always seems to hit 3-5 home runs per game against me, even with pitchers like Jacob DeGrom on the mound (and I am using realistic strategies) and even against teams that don't hit a lot of home runs. My record in live games is probably something like 10-40 as a result of these issues. I find it really hard to win live games and I don't feel like the game is using as realistic a model for them as it is for the standard sims where it's not trying to simulate every pitch.

The only other real criticism I have of the game is the interface, which is often very cluttered and confusing. After 68 hours of play, I still sometimes have trouble figuring out where things are, or remembering where I saw a particular screen. There are just so many different screens and they're not all logically organized or even necessary. For example, you can't seem to initiate a trade from your own team's ""transactions"" screen; you have to go to the MLB's ""transactions"" screen, which actually takes you to ""free agents"" first, then you have to click the ""trades"" button, then you can choose ""shop player"", ""initiate trade"" or various other options... not all of which probably need to even be there. Another example: there's a ""rosters"" screen for your team that shows all but the lowest level of your minor league system, and then there's also a ""minors"" screen that's the same screen but just without the MLB team included. I don't know why both of these screens need to exist. Just put all of the minor league teams on the main roster screen.

So this game could use some cleanup, certainly an update to its live game graphics, and maybe the live simulation engine as well. But it's still just incredibly deep and addicting for that reason. If you're one of those people that's always found the team-building aspects of other baseball games as much as or more compelling than the action-oriented parts, this is the game for you.

24,Out of the Park Baseball 21,73838275,english,"This is the first time that I have purchased an OOTP Baseball sim. I have enjoyed much of my time with the game thus far. It is certainly true that no other sports sim comes close to representing the league experience quite like this one. It is comprehensive, extremely detailed, and more engrossing than any other simulator I have come across to date. 

I cannot in good faith, however, give a positive review of the game. The developers' decision to list this as including  “Cross-platform multiplayer” is borderline dishonest, and the endless parade of bugs minor and major that you will no-doubt encounter is almost too much to bear.
Yes, it does have the option to participate in a league with other human players, but only after you have jumped through hoop after hoop to get there. I don't think this is made explicitly clear anywhere on the store page, but you need to have some backend web development experience to be able to start your own multiplayer league. I want to highlight this point for those who are buying this game with the intention of having some seamlessly smooth online league with their pals, a la The Show. Once again:
[b] You need to have backend web development experience or the time and energy to learn web development to be able to start your own online league. [/b]

The frustratingly lacking Online Manual alludes to it only very briefly, saying ""Generally, commissioners are reasonably web-savvy."" I'm no Alan Turing, sure, but I'm no slouch either. The phrase ""Web-savvy"" clearly means something very different to video game developers than it does to than players, because it took me nearly two dozen hours to get this to work. Several steps required to get your league functioning are not mentioned anywhere in the OOTP Manual, so be prepared to dig through a decade of forums posts to find what you are looking for (shoutout to everyone on the forums who have helped me thus far).The Commish league access key they send you doesn't work, so set about 2 hours or so to do an on-boarding where everyone enters their FTP information. Make sure your webhost offers solutions that still use the ancient FTP, by the way, and not the much more ubiquitous FTPS/SFTP; a lot of web-hosting services don't even offer FTP compatibility in 2020. Further, make sure you are familiar with Plesk or other backend formats when you add the OOTP21 file directories to your web server. 

If this sounds esoteric, don’t buy this game with the intention of playing online. You will need to familiarize yourself with this and much more if you expect to get an online league going. 

OOTP21 is probably the theoretical limit of what you can call a “multiplayer experience”. You are, in essence, emailing a save file back and forth once a day. Only, that isn’t quite accurate, as emailing a file doesn’t cost $100 a year between a domain and the most basic hosting plan and works nearly every time you do it. That isn’t an issue by itself, as that’s part-and-parcel to the simulator experience. What stuns and disappoints me most about OOTP Baseball is that [b] such a simple thing isn’t implemented as an out-of-the-box feature of the game [/b]. Is it too much to expect a franchise that’s 20+ years old and sports the price tag of a AAA title to run like one? Early Access games all over Steam that are still in *beta* have netcodes that do far more complicated tasks for much less than a $40 price tag. Given the immense legwork required to setup a multiplayer league, the whole thing has left me feeling like I need a shower.

If this wasn’t enough to induce a headache, how about the game-breaking bugs me and the other players in my league experience encounter daily? I’ve been putting out fires left and right since this thing began. Trades often work for one end of the deal but not the other, players will have cleared waivers but will be stuck in the wire, players constantly need to be moved manually via the editor, AI GMs will issue contract offers and trades directly counter to your instructions, online file downloads will crash the game half the time, file exports will bring up the online settings two or three times before exporting the team, file exports will insist they were successful even though they weren’t, and so forth. And that’s nothing to say of the dozens of graphics bugs on every other menu screen, that, while not painfully disruptive to gameplay, are demonstrative of serious lack of polish that a $40 game in its 23rd year of existence should sport.
At the end of the day, it is difficult to give a decades-old franchise the benefit of the doubt when there are so many bugs that persist well into the lifespan of the series. It is hard to be patient with the daily chore of keeping an online league stumbling forward when next-to-no support/patches/QoL updates are released for multiplayer users/commissioners. It is impossible to be charitable toward the “small team of passionate devs” narrative when an annual series is peppering me with reminders to buy the “Perfect Team” microtransaction packs after already investing $150 to get my league online. 

My advice is to spend your hard-earned cash elsewhere. When the game works as intended it is great fun. But be warned-- your good time will be interrupted by bugs that should have been fixed long, long ago, provided you can even get your online league working in the first place.

If you are looking to play as a single player or watch a baseball game played out like a televised game then go play MLB The Show. If you want to micromanage a team as a GM or Manager of a team, looking over spreadsheets of data, arranging deals, signing FA, setting lineups, pitching rotations, managing the minor leagues, calling players up or sending them down, then this game is for you. You'll spend a large amount of time micromanaging the organization as a whole. I rare if ever even play a actual game of baseball often letting the games auto-simulate and letting me focus on making trades, fine tuning my farm and majors roster. 

With all that said some of my issues that have even persisted into this newest edition include the following:
1. The trade system is pretty flawed. Money involved in trades holds little to no impact, and teams often undervalue what players you offer but overvalue their own players. They will offer a 1 star veteran for a 5 star prospect but scoff at deals where I offer a 3 star quality player for their 3 star quality or less player or deals where it's respectfully balanced. I've additionally noticed trades between 2 AI controlled teams will accept lopsided deals. I don't know if that is the game trying to maintain a balance among teams or if it's just poorly programmed to make bad deals.

2. Teams rely way too much on leadership, spark plug personalities. If you don't have enough on the roster the team tanks hard but if you have majority on a roster the team doesn't suffer from crippling depression. 

3. I love scouting, and often favor my team budget towards scouting for the upcoming draft but find the results confusing or having little to no impact on what results my scouts return. I get and accept that there are a large number of prospects in the world and some will be overlooked but it would be nice if there was some sort of way to better identify well known prospects and focus on them first then expand prospect searches from there I feel I'd be taking less gambles with my first round picks. 

4. This last one is more in regards to playing actual baseball games. Part of the reason I don't bother with them is visually it is terrible. I don't expect The Show quality visuals but I still would like some sort of revamp of the way games are displayed. For some that want the full package this would allow them to fully play this game and enjoy it entirely, 

All in all, this game and the previous installments in the series are fun (for some of us), allow endless game play with varying results each time you play with different teams or even the same team. The fantasy drafts can be fun too but be aware the drafts themselves take forever since you are doing over 200 rounds of picks (if I recall correctly). You can opt to simulate the rounds but I always worry the AI will draft poorly. Last thing you want are a bunch of 35+ old vets that eat up your budget.

BUYER BEWARE

This title contains extremely addictive properties that might suck you into a bottomless time vortex only remedied by the release of the next year's title.

Jokes aside, this is an incredibly well-built franchise simulator that's as rewarding as it is challenging (particularly in the mode where you can't change player stats).
The algorithm built out & maintained for the game (Most of the AI bugs of the past [previously, relief pitching had been dramatically undervalued by the AI] have been patched) is terrific, the game is regularly supported, and  is very well-balanced, with outcomes very likely to mirror what would be the real-world outcomes.

On-field gameplay:
Don't think high graphics and flashy presentation; think of the game as full-time franchise mode with your ability to manage a game as little or much as you'd like. On-field play options are mostly based on where you're defensively shifting, when to steal, whether to pitch around a play or intentionally walk, warm up & call in replacement pitching, then pressing the space bar to see the next play (I personally play to only see scoring/ out plays and let the AI take care of everything but pitching changes -- with this setup a game lasts ~15 minutes).

Off-field gameplay:
I see the game and see a very very very complicated spreadsheet with a very functional user interface laid on top, with the development of a franchise top-to-bottom (including minor league player development and moving players through the system). Again, with many of the most complicated, time-consuming features the AI can automate for you.

In conclusion, building a team, spending hours optimizing the perfect trade, seeing the team you've built establish an identity & the clubhouse gel or fall apart, seeing how those factors play out on the field, seeing momentum make or break a talented players season while up-and-comers with lower stat potential surprise everyone, and all the other thoughtful features make this game engaging -- especially in a year where it's been the only outlet to scratch my baseball itch. I played through four seasons, which took me hundreds of hours to play the way I wanted, only to win my first world series in the fourth. After so much time, effort, and genuine care for the team, I literally jumped up and celebrated the championship.

This has been the most engaging game I've ever played because it lines up so well with multiple of my interests, but I couldn't recommend it enough to anyone who reads this and isn't immediate turned off.

You can manage a baseball team anywhere from the minors up to the pros, and make all the moves and decisions to try to elevate your team to Wold Series champs. You can even customize your new game to make a new, fictional league of your own with various rules that strikes your fancy. Even within all this, how much you want to be hands-on is up to you. Some like to manage everything, including pitch-by-pitch plays of individual games. Others like to simulate them or do some mixture of the two.

This is an excellent baseball sim. It is also, however, much more than that. Extremely in depth, but also surprisingly accessable to newcomers.

There is so much enjoyment to be found here, scouting for talent, trading players, working through each game play by play. You can watch as much as every ball through to as little as auto resolving the whole match or even the whole season if you want. The depth and customisability of this game is unsurpassed in Sports management software.

For British fans particularly, the obvious comparison is the FM series. This surpasses that in quality of depth and enjoyment for me. You can even create entire league structures with their own rules - my next game will be a completely customised UK baseball league with promotion and relegation etc.

They could have gone cash grab and didnt and I respect that, but its not a good way to enjoy this game.   At all.  I particularly love the reviews when you read them that are like, ""Well running my franchise is super hard I made all these amazing signings and we are still sub .500.... but Perfect Team is the ULTIMATE CHALLENGE""

No... franchise is lol.   Building your team over years and developing talent and keeping the core of your team together over years while somehow still improving... THAT is the meat of this game.   Not the dumb side mode that youre telling yourself made this years game worth it.

I picked it up on sale.   I basically paid for a roster update over last years game like I do most years.   Because this is still the best sports management sim to date.  Thats why it gets a thumbs up.   If all I had to consider was each game's changes this franchise would get the biggest thumbs down I could muster up for years now.   And maybe thats unfair because the changes they do make each year make the game run better.... but they do charge for these yearly updates lol.  Its not like they just fix the game out of the kindness of their hearts,  All told is Perfect Team worth yet another $40? Absolutely not.

But its STILL the finest GM management style game to date and everyone else is playing catch up at a good distance.    If youre into the numbers crunching aspect of baseball you'll be satisfied here.   TONS of stats to mull over.   I just wish theyd really flesh this out as far as how you can see them and apply them.   The franchise has been around forever.   Instead of garbage digital card games maybe they can fill out how stats are represented.   Make it easier to see how certain players do versus other players.   How does this pitcher matchup versus this batter?   Focus on that aspect rather than the next great cash grab.   Because as it stands its much more about how your pitcher does overall against everyone rather than how they do against certain hitters or certain styles of hitters and vice versa.  The duel between pitcher and batter is the most fun part of baseball and this game has never even attempted to capture that.

The Good: 
You can be the boss in any era.  Manage in era any level.  You can be Babe Ruth's boss, Nolan Ryan's boss, Sid Bream's boss!!  The power!!!  
You can fire Reggie Jackson, or worse trade him to the lowly 1977 Mariners for ace fireballer Grant Jackson.  That will teach him to hustle.
The ability to run your team or league is very detailed.  You can make as many variations to your league as you want.

The Meh.
Playing a baseball game is meh.  the graphics and pictures of the players are meh.  It's the least enjoyable part of the game in my opinion.  Although the Dead ball era guys are error mongers so that was fun to watch.

The Bad.
The balance between your minor league coaches and the development of players is  really weird at over a hundred and twenty hours I still can't make heads or tails of it.  I had Mike Flanagan in 1977 and he is so underdeveloped, he's about to get waived.    I mean I kind of like the fact the historical studs might jinx out on you and suck if you develop them wrong.  But I can't figure out the development aspect.    This is frustrating.  I also had Steve Carlton switched to first base in the minors.  You really have to pay attention to every league and player every day or something wonky will eventually happen to someone you like.  

The Ugly,

Trades with the originate with the AI.  holy crap is this broken and not in a Mike Schmidt for Barry Jones kind of way.  It's the other way around.  The AI will offer you a trade; Here is 37 year old Darrel Porter C 49/49 for your Nolan Ryan SP 79/80 Dickie Thon 2b  48/77 and seventh round draft pick.   Basically because you have a rookie catcher with a 44/48 line.    bugs the crap out of me, and the dumb AI will offer it as much as three times with minor variations.  like it's being cool or something, trying to help a brother out.  
You can't let the AI run your team on any level.  It is super stupid.  I know it takes a lot of time to manage rosters every day, but if you let the AI even put a player on IR it will screw it up and put your top pitching prospect with a 29/80 line on Irrevocable waivers.   This happen once too many times for me.  Also make sure you pay close attention to the rule 5 draft, especially if you decide to play as an expansion team.  Make sure you put every drafted player on your roster as soon as you can.. The AI, doesn't do this for you even when it asks if you want it to set your rosters.  

Final thoughts.  This has got me through without baseball.  I have had fun running a team through the seventies into the eighties.  I have learned a lot about players and how being a GM must suck so very much.  But I keep coming back to it.  the game has flaws.  It really does make you slap your head when it lets you trade for Mike Flanagan and Scott McGregor for some no name first basemen with a 42/60 line, but won't part with a 28/28 minor league catcher for a top of the line third baseman 59/59.  I guess it takes into account payroll?  or team need?  I have no idea.  Still learning how to make it happen.  The adventures are endless.  This is light years ahead of Hockey Manager which is a crap sandwich.  Good hunting!

68,Out of the Park Baseball 21,70256094,english,"Let me start with two things above all else:

(1) I LOVE this game. I have spent well over 100 hours in the past three weeks playing, creating, fiddling with, and reading about to try and get the full experience. It is MAGNIFICENT and worth every penny. 

(2) It is NOT user friendly or intuitive. 

Let's start with the second since it has been a good deal of my time. 

The deepest levels of the game were created for computer people and statistical wonks who have an innate and deep understanding of coding and computer operations. When I learned my coding and serial synchronistic bus communications, it was the very late 70's and early 80s. I never kept up on the hardware stuff, and frankly, by the time windows 3.1.1 came out, the need for my knowledge and skills was long past. I understand the principles, but the actual meat and potatoes are pretty deep. The online manuals are written for people who have that grasp, and what seems blindingly obvious to them, isn't so much to people with lesser skills. 

Take, for example, the Backup and restore functions. None of these are intuitive nor are they ""Click Here to Back Up"" simple. Dealing with large databases and a great deal of data, they require some understanding of what exactly you are doing and why. By way of example, it took me more than a week to figure out that when restoring a game you MUST change the file name. Sure, it's in the manual, but it is NOT included in any ""step-by-step"" procedure for doing it. this is systemic of most of the items covered in the manual - there is very little ""This is how you do this, and a lot of descriptive stuff that isn't codified into a procedure. 

All that said, it IS doable, you just have to have a lot of patience and a willingness to actually READ, not skim, things. It seems like a big investment for a game. In the computer game world, it is always a trade-off between playability and realism. There as lots of ""playable"" baseball simulations available, but they are NOT OOTP 21. 

I recommend that you start small. It's tempting to jump into the full thing with a 2020 season of MLB with every MiLB team and be the GM and the Manager. But the way I learned the game was to start as a Pioneer League manager and begin to work my way up. But even in that, it's not as easy as it seems. There is a process to get that job that is not intuitive and required some trial and error. 

Once mastered, though, this is the most amazing baseball game in the world. 

Especially so this season, it has provided me with a great deal of comfort and entertainment. I am currently running three ""seasons."" The first a full-on 2020 MLB season which has me managing in the Pioneer League (Ogden, my ""hometown""), a special league of the worst MLB teams of the modern error (Seattle 1983) and my beloved Stockton Ports in a pretend California League that has me playing the schedule each day and then documenting it for posterity (https://stocktonports2020.wordpress.com/) 

We tried to do our fantasy league using an ""Online"" season with the game, but frankly, and this goes back to the stuff above, it is a morass of unexplained and indecipherable tech speak that ended that effort. Alas. We are still trying to figure it out, but it doesn't look hopeful. 

This leads to my only real recommendation for the manuals and the game, there need to Procedural lists of how to do specific things. It's easy to leave it to be figured out using the game forums and trial and error, but it's not user friendly, and its the kind of thing that annoys older players like me.

There is also the issue in the game of the size of the fonts used, but now I am just being a grumpy old man who CANNOT READ THE DAMN THING BECAUSE IT'S TOO SMALL! But that's for another day and in no way affects the overall value and enjoyment of the game. 

Buy it, learn it, and enjoy the best baseball simulation out there. It may annoy you but by the end of it, you'll come to appreciate its attention to detail and just plain out Baseball fun.

69,Out of the Park Baseball 21,69370414,english,"I do enjoy the game however how developers think it is appropriate to have constant ads pop up when you start the game and also when I click to go into a game-mode within the game I get another pop up. Allow me to permanently turn these off if you are going to put these in. I wasn't aware before my purchase and I will definitely be double-checking if this is the case in the future before buying.

Edit: Following on from the response from the devs I have been able to turn off the ""news"" pop ups which was honestly one of my biggest frustrations as I like to quickly just jump in and out of the game to check on my perfect team and to have those pop up everytime was frustrating. I still don't feel like those should be in-game and should just be advertised on social media or within steam but at least the option is there to turn it off. 

I have changed my recommendation as I initially said I do enjoy the game, you can spend countless hours in the single-player simulation, the historical option is a great idea which gives you even more hours of gameplay. Lastly Perfect Team is also really enjoyable, being able to compete against others in general leagues and also tournaments is great.

Rebuilding is so much fun this year as you don't have to gamble and hope that they top rated prospect you traded assets for does not go down to a 2 star potential in just 1 year or assign a coach just for the player so that you do not have to feel like you wasted your time trying to progress them, progression feels so good in this game and rewarding in past OOTP Baseball games Rebulding was so fustrating this years game is miles better.

-Tons of customization options, you can take the MLB and turn it into a 60 team 3 tier league system similar to the European soccer, mods and community creations provide just about anything you could ever want and there are websites that allow you to create custom jerseys, hats, and ballparks.
-Incredible Realism, this game predicted like the last 5 world series correctly. 
-SO MUCH DEPTH, every stat you would want, you can literally take over any MLB season from 1871 to now with accurate players and stats, accurate players in bigger international leagues (KBO, NPB etc)
- You can easily lose 10 hours into this game and not even notice

Negative
-The graphics are lacking but look muchhhh better than earlier installments of the series
-You don't actually get to play baseball with the players
-Too much customization and too many leagues in one save can easily lead to chugging on weaker machines
-There's a massive learning curve, and it can easily be overwhelming at times. And customization is really easy once you figure out how to do it but its a bit unintuitive at first.

If you do or have followed MLB at all, you will immediately become addicted to this game.  I have managed a few games which had game endings that were as thrilling as actually being at the real ball park.  Big time thumbs up for this game.

Pros:

Detailed but easy to understand if you are familiar with baseball statistics and managing strategies.
Tons of options but you can have the AI control any part that you would rather just watch.
Ball parks and crowd noises that look and sound fairly realistic.
Can play major leagues, minor leagues, fantasy, and international players.
Can adjust the rules of each game, league, season, and more.
Much more.

Cons:

Not for those that want to physically hit, pitch and throw the ball like on a PS4 game. (I don't)
May be too detailed for those not familiar with baseball in general.

I also miss not hearing the stadium announcer call out the batter, pitcher and player substitutions.

This game is fun but sometimes this game can be frustrating especially when games don't go the way you think they should or as they have in real life.  And sometimes this game makes you feel like you are a champion.  But one thing is certain, this game has a way of sucking you in and not letting go.

58,Out of the Park Baseball 21,69140599,english,"So I'm mainly a PC gamer and I have had the Baseball itch without it happening live. I purchased another Baseball game which is extremely fun to play as a classic ""Baseball Game"" Game, but then I kept hearing about this Simulation Baseball game called OOTP.

I looked into it, as as a Baseball lifer, and a numbers dork, I thought why not let me check this out, the price isn't super expensive and I see a ton of positive feedback for it.

Let me say, it was a GREAT decision for this purchase, and OOTP Baseball just earned a lifelong fan who will be buying all the next yearly iteration and ""OOTP Go"" whenever that comes to the table.

The whole idea of make any baseball game, series, season, career, or century with any real teams from 1871 to Present, was just overwhelming with possibilities! The options on how to customize is the type of depth that control freaks will drool over, and that historians that want to get details down correctly will fall in love with!

BUT, the absolute best part of this game is that 'Extra Mode' that was added in recent years. Perfect Team. My goodness... I had no clue how it worked, or what to do in my first season, but as I played around with it I figured it out little by little.

In my very first season, in danger of missing the playoffs, my team won it's final 7 and the team in front of me for a Wild Card lost it's final 9, leading to a game 163 which I won... Then won the Wild Card, and the Division Series, then the Conference Series!.. and then going up 3 games to 1 in the World Series..... to lose the last 3 games, Game 6 losing 1-0, and Game 7 losing 5-4 by allowing 2 runs in the Bottom of the 8th. INSTANTLY. HOOKED. Now I understand the concept and flow of it, and look forward to this almost more than simulating my own league! If this game was only Perfect Team, it would still be worth the price tag! An absolutely Grand Slam of a game mode!

I can continue to ramble, but instead of that, please support this development team if you are a Baseball fan, of ANY League (This game supports MLB, Nippon, World Cup, and about a dozen other Countries real leagues!).

I am beyond satisfied with this purchase and I will recommend this game to all baseball fans who use PC! 

Thank you OOTP Developments for bringing this new excitement into my world! I wish your team a solid future and I hope you all get the support your team is targeting!

73,Out of the Park Baseball 21,68888741,english,"TL;DR: Why are you reading this? BUY IT!!!

I've been playing OOTP since the very first iteration in 1999. For as rough as it was back then, I could sense that this was going to grow into an amazing baseball simulator. Well, I was wrong. It is far more than amazing!

Let's get a few things out of the way first. OOTP21 is NOT a P2W game. There is a mode titled Perfect Team which does have transactions. This mode is really not related to the main game itself. In OOTP21 you can play ANY team in professional baseball history, and a whole lot more. OOTP21 is NOT just a GM simulation. You can play it that way if you want to, but, the beauty of this game is that you can eschew finances and concentrate on the game as it is played on the field. Lastly, this is not an arcade game. If you want something like that, check out Super Mega Baseball 3 or MLB The Show. OOTP21 is a strategy game so you'll be exercising grey matter.

OOTP21 is an extremely deep, flexible, yet accessible baseball sim. The possibilities are virtually endless in this massive baseball sandbox. Want to jump in and play the 2020 season? One mouse click and you're all set. Feel like replaying a past season in Major League Baseball? Unlike other baseball sims where you have to buy individual seasons, in OOTP21 every MLB season from 1871 to the present is included. Each season has real life lineups for each team and when available, actual transactions.

Perhaps you are interested in replaying past World Series. That is just two mouse clicks and you are in the Fall Classic of your choice! How about a huge tournament of teams from any year in MLB? OOTP21 has you covered with tournaments that can contain up to any 64 teams you wish. What's more, you can decide the seeding and the format of the tournament, or, you can easily convert it into a season. Even better, you can normalize to a specific year in baseball. Curious as to how well Ty Cobb would do in 2019? You can do it! Hpw many home runs would Barry Bonds have hit in 1912? OOTP21 lets you explore this and a virtually limitless number of scenarios.

The accuracy of OOTP21's engine is unparalleled. As you are replaying a season, there is a function that allows you to see just how close your replay is to the actual season. I know of no other baseball sim that does this. It is frighteningly accurate. Of course,, if you are managing a team, your decisions will affect the outcome.

Some other baseball sims allow you - at extra charge - to replay some other baseball leagues such as the Negro Leagues, minor leagues, and international leagues. In OOTP21 they are ALL included! Additionally, you can revisit rogue major leagues of the past such as the Union Association, Players League, American Association, and the Federal League.

OOTP21 allows you experience baseball the way you want to from a macro approach as a GM , owner, and even commissioner, all the way down to managing every game at a pitch by pitch level if you want. Depth and flexibility are the foundation of this sophisticated sim.

New to OOTP21 is a ballpark creator. At the time of this review, it is in its first iteration but already robust enough that you can create some very cool looking parks. If however, you don't want to roll your own, the included 3D models are absolutely spot on. Additionally, OOTP21 is very mod-friendly. It has integrated Workshop support and you can download every MLB park from 1901 to the present day.

You can customize your players too. You can choose to use OOTP21's Facegen technology or opt to import actual player photos.

Maybe you want a different type of challenge. Perhaps you want to create a league of entirely fictional ;layers and teams complete with their own logos and uniforms. You can do that as well. You can also create fictional or alternative history leagues in which players will randomly debut from all eras of baseball. 

Also new to the game is real time camera movement. The game comes with many camera angles that you can set in game or create your own. This really increases the immersion factor.

No game is perfect. OOTP21 still has some issues that I would love to see some improvement on. The action on the field doesn't quite sync with the commentary on the scoreboard. This can be a little frustrating at times. The game's UI is good, but, because of the near fathomless depth of the game, there are gobs and stacks of choices you can make to customize your experience. Some of these are rather buried and need to be more pronounced.

Individual player import is a bear. This is an area in which OOTP could take a page from some other baseball sims such as Action PC Baseball. In that game, you simply type the player's name, choose the season, and draft him onto a team. In OOTP21, you have to get the player's Baseball Reference ID, then type in that ID, the season, year, and team. To do multiple players, you need to create a text document. For a game as flexible as OOTP21, I am surprised that a more efficient method for player import hasn't been implemented.

There is really only one more thing that OOTP needs and it will be the most immersive sim ever created. It needs an announcer. Let me explain. Games like MLB The Show have announcers but you'll notice that they are rather limited. There is one  baseball sim that nailed announcing and that was APBA Baseball for Windows Broadcast Blast. In that game, legendary announcer Ernie Harwell recorded the names of every major league player from 1871 to 1998. Then, through some very cool tech-wizardry, APBA used recordings of Harwell calling games and integrated it all together such that when you play the game, it really feels like you're listening to an actual baseball radio broadcast.

92,Out of the Park Baseball 21,68674668,english,"It is July 28, 2020. 

In spite of some extremely clever moves to bolster the starting pitching staff and bring in much-needed offensive firepower, my Mets are sitting at 52-53.  The Syndergaard injury has been too difficult to overcome. 

Still, there is hope.  The Mets are just 3 games back in the chase for the final NL Wildcard.  The bats have come alive and starting pitching has been strong.  I managed to get out of Robinson Cano's contract to free up some cash to bring in a star free agent in the offseason.  2021 is going to be our year, but there is still hope for a run to the playoffs this year.

But the bullpen.  Oh my god.  While Seth Lugo has been amazing and earned a trip to the All Star game, Diaz has 8 blown saves.  I thought about trading him, but he's got such great stuff.  I always feel like he's on the verge of coming around...

Tonight, the 57-48 Yankees are at CitiField for the third game of the subway series.  Steven Matz is on the mound for the Mets, and while he's a little overmatched, he manages to pitch 5 sparkling innings, allowing only one run on two hits.  Ahmed Rosario (who has been great all season), hit a solo homer off Gerrit Cole in the bottom of the 4th and the CitiField scoreboard shows a 1-1 game.

It's the top of the 6th.  Matz is gassed.  I hold my breath and bring Jeurys Familia out of the bullpen.  He's been pretty good this year, but I never feel comfortable with him on the mound.  He gives up a walk and a hit, but manages to induce an inning-ending double play.  I pump my fist.

Roasario (I love you right now, man) hits ANOTHER solo shot in the bottom of the 6th and the Mets pull ahead!  I turn to the exceptional Seth Lugo who mows down three Yankee batters.  With the score remaining 2-1 in the top of the 8th, I turn to Betances who gets the job done by retiring the side.  The Mets fail to score any more runs in the bottom of the 8th.

That brings us to the top of the ninth, with the Mets cleaning desperately to a 2-1 lead over our cross-town rivals.  Betances is out of gas.

I turn to Diaz.

I am filled with fear.

Up first is Gary Sanchez.  He goes down swinging on a 1-2 fastball.

Next up in Miguel Andujar who has been ON FIRE.  I tell Diaz to pitch cautiously and Andujar manages to work the count full.  The 3-2 pitch is low.  Andujar walks to first.

THIS IS HOW IT HAPPENS!!!!  EVERY FREAKING TIME!!!  I can see it.  I can see it clearly.  Diaz is gonna throw a fastball right down the middle to LeMahieu and it's going to land somewhere near the Shake Shack behind the center field wall.  And it will be MY FAULT.  I should've let Lugo go an extra inning.  I should've traded him!

But I didn't.  

And now it's the bottom of the ninth and the game is on the line.

F@#! it man, go after him Diaz.  Your best stuff against his.

Diaz strikes him out with his fastball on a 3-2 count!

The Yankees bring in Mike Ford to Pinch Hit with two outs.
Diaz is on a roll.
I'm pumped.
Go after him Edwin.

Ford makes contact on a 1-2 pitch, driving the ball to deep center.  
Nimmo hustles over (as always) and makes a diving catch.  

THE METS WIN!

I audibly yell ""Yeah!"" in my Brooklyn apartment.

Maybe I'll keep Diaz.  Maybe he's coming around.  I really like the guy.  I'll have to think about it. 

I don't know.

But I do know this:  I miss baseball bad.  I miss sitting at CitiField on a beautiful afternoon with a cold beer in my hand.  I miss hearing Gary, Keith, and Ron call the games on SNY.  I miss complaining about the moves the team makes or fails to make.  I wonder when I'll get to again.

Out of the Park Baseball 21 has brought baseball back into my life, and it's awesome.  When I bought it, I was expecting it to do a spectacular job of simulating the experience of putting together a franchise and managing games; it delivers on that promise.  What I was not expecting was how well it simulates the experience of being a fan of baseball.  It manages to simulate the emotional experience of following a franchise as a fan.  It has been a great surprise and a wonderful addition to my life while stuck in COVID quarantine.  I keep it rolling in the background while I work from home.

It's great.  If you like data and you like baseball, you will love this game.

I don't know where I've been all these years, but this is the first OOTP I've owned. I've always wanted to play a baseball sim where you control the team, the prospects, the trading, the draft picks, etc etc etc. In this game you can do this...you don't have too (there other options you can be), but running a franchise is fun! Hard work sometimes of course.

Game play runs pretty smoothly. I play the franchise side and also the Perfect Team ongoing game as well as enter tournaments based on the cards I've amassed. The franchise side of the game is completely separate to the Perfect Team. I've also rediscovered my joy of 'buying' a pack of baseball cards, ripping them open, and hoping for those rarer cards to show up.

At times the servers will get a little stuck, but that's been infrequent and never more than a small hiccup. I believe the 'live' player cards update stat and ranking-wise during the season - which they have yet to do because of having no current season on play yet.

My only annoyance with the game is the occasional slip when receiving and email or a box score break down that refers to me with a male pronoun even after entering female in the setup. They get it right sometimes though - probably a tough coding thing to catch every single instance.

I'm so addicted to this game - its really helped with missing the season this year. I bought it on launch day and piled 204+ hours into it already. The stay at home order helped with that. lol

33,Out of the Park Baseball 21,68078258,english,"It's a fun stats game, and for a game all about stats it seems to fit perfectly. I'll give a few pros and cons.

PROS
- Great for people who love baseball, love competition, and love to be in charge of their own team.
-You can start a new game anytime from 1871 to the present. I currently have an 1871 start and it's really cool to how accurate things are. Errors everywhere, home runs no where, pitchers throwing 130+ pitches in complete games with a run score of 20-25, and some of the news stories you get are time accurate as well.
- Perfect Team is good for people who love competing against other. Maybe you're like me and love baseball but aren't really good at MLB The Show. Games every 30 minutes, playoffs, tournaments, and promotion/relegation system.
- So many different cards to collect, Live Series, Historical Series, One-Hit Wonders, Snapshots, etc.
- Also included is every major league from around the world as well as Independent leagues in the U.S. Thanks to this game I actually found out there is an Independent team close to me.
- To me it feels simple to understand but challenging to master. I've tweaked my strategies over and over to try and find the right winning formula.

CONS
- Sometimes it feels like your winning strategy just stops working for no reason as your watch your team string together 20+ losses in a row and you can't seem to fix it. This has happened to me on multiple saves with just about every team. I understand teams go through streaks but it seems a bit off when most of the losses are by 10 runs or more.
- The 3D animation looks nice but it's timing if off. I've seen a ball from the outfield thrown to the shortstop as a runner gets to third. The shortstop then holds the ball as the runner runs to home and scores. I have a lot more that's happened but would make this to long.
- With cards to buy that means if people put more money into the game to get better cards then they have a better chance to win. This isn't really a CON because it's not broken, but it could be hard for people who don't want to pay any extra but still want to compete in Perfect Team tournaments.
- Game crashes at times for no reason. Make sure you auto save at least monthly or weekly. I suggest saving a good bit to.

Overall I love the game. I love stats and spreadsheet games like this, you can see my profile and check the hours I've put into the Football Manager series. Historical starts are fun and Perfect Team is a great competition.

Hell, even if you don't necessarily like baseball, but you are looking for an in-depth sports sim, this is for you. This game is strictly simulation however and there is no playing a baseball game and controlling the players, however you can watch the game still. 

I found the OOTP franchise when OOTP 20 was about to come out. I bought 19 and after playing for a few hours, instantly preordered 20. This game scratches my sports itch where many games can't and this is one of the only games I can play for a long time and not get tired of. This game really makes you feel like a real life GM/Manager of a baseball franchise. 

In this game, you can play a near to life MLB franchise starting in any year to current,(the draft even has real prospects in it), a fictional,  custom season where you can make the league as big or as small as you want, different playoff structure, etc. THE CUSTOMIZATION IN THIS GAME IS WILD! You can do so many things with this game to the point where it is hard to get tired of it. 

If you like Madden Ultimate Team or MLB the Shows Diamond Dynasty this game even has a mode like that. It is pretty new, but is amazing already and they are constantly adding new cards. I HAVE NOT SPENT A DIME ON THIS GAME MODE AND I AM IN THE TOP TIER. This game mode is not pay to win and you can easily compete spending no money at all. Even if you do, ratings on this game mean a ton, and you can still win with players with different ratings, if you build your team right.

The only Con I have on this game is that multiplayer still is not Peer-to-Peer and is done via FTP servers, but if you want to play online with people, the forums have tons of people making online leagues that are great at it and you can play leagues where every team is controlled by a human.


IF you have any doubts about this game, or buy the game and are confused about how it works. There are great tutorials out there to teach you how to play this game, and as soon as you learn, you will be hooked.

Granted, a lot of it is while I leave it running in the background, but still, that should give you an idea as to how much I'm playing it. All I've been playing is the Perfect Team mode, which reminds me of the Madden card game. Quite fun. This is definitely scratching my baseball itch during the COVID19 shutdown when I can't get my fantasy baseball. Also, it has 1994 Jeff Bagwell as a 97 overall card that's a reward for collecting 26 live Astros cards. 1994 Jeff Bagwell was incredible, and I'm stoked that they have it. Favorite player ever.

The Perfect Team mode is definitely pay2win, but I threw $5 at it and have been having plenty of fun. They split you up into leagues based on how good you are, so you don't have to buy the $100 pack or anything to be competitive. Also, they have a bunch of tournaments where which cards you can have is limited, so there's plenty to do for players who don't want pay extra money when the game itself isn't free. Also, if you're worried about the pay2win aspect of Perfect Team, don't. Building up your team is literally the game, so paying to shortcut that process really cheats you out of fully enjoying it. I'd say giving them $5 just to get a little jump start is good, and then just grind it out. It'll be all the more satisfying when you eventually do have a p2w-quality team.",1586631925,1586882765,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,144,6,64551,5157,3924,1602085092,,

I've been playing in fantasy leagues since Rickie Henderson was the first pick of any draft, Eddie Murray was my secret weapon, and everyone was reading the National. This game is a very close approximation of a true day in the life of a fantasy player. Some of the bells and whistles get in the way, and the menu pull downs aren't always intuitive, but the game play is challenging and frustrating and very true to life.
       I have been playing Baseball Mogul since the company that makes it has been selling it and OOTP 21 falls short in the number of historical players available and is not nearly as polished or organized. Perfect Team mode is something I had always hoped would happen and I am enjoying it everyday. There are some small adjustments that might simplify game play, and making it easier to both set up tournament teams and see results would be great, but none of these issues change the enjoyment I get from playing.

59,Out of the Park Baseball 21,66643428,english,"When this game was first made way back when, it was aimed at baseball fans who wanted to be a general manager. Making decisions about calling up players, getting into player development and contracts, things like that. I am that type of player.

But over the last 2-3 years, every addition to this game has been to attract more casual players and players who might want to do other things than strictly GM. The on-field game appearance has had a lot of work, for people who like to manually manage the games. Perfect Team has been added, which is pretty much a pay to win card-based game like you'd see in Madden.

I know why they're doing this. The PC baseball gaming scene is so crap that players who would usually be playing a game like The Show are seeing if OOTP meets their needs. And OOTP developments is trying to, because there's a hell of a lot of money in it. But in so doing they have done absolutely nothing in recent years to make the game better for its original core of players. There's a ""prospect pipeline"" now which is pretty much exactly the same as the ""Top 100 prospects"" list we got before. Scouting and drafting is a little bit different, but not significantly different. But things that might really matter, like player personalities, more sensible ownership goals, communication between GM and on-field manager... it's all exactly the same as it was 8 years ago. You have hitting and pitching coaches and absolutely no way to know, as a player, how good they actually are unless you cheat FFS.

I think overall OOTP is a great franchise, certainly the best baseball game out there. Out of my top 10 played games, 4 of them are different versions of OOTP. But I have to be honest here and say that OOTP Developments has not done a damn thing for more hardcore single player GM-only types like me for 4 years now. I'm getting tired of looking at the new releases and seeing nothing that interests me.

So if you're looking to upgrade from 18, 19, or 20, and you're not into playing Perfect Team and you don't physically manage your games out, then there is nothing here for you even if the game is on sale. You're being taken for granted while OOTP developments tries to woo different types of players.

I certainly hope OOTP 22 has something - the coaches finally getting fixed, more personality for players, owners, and coaches, things like that, for non-casual players.

80,Out of the Park Baseball 21,66392662,english,"This is a very good simulator, if you want to replay a specific season, regardless of whether it is from 1871 or 2020. The game recognizes 8 eras: 

*1871-1900    Early Years                                         *1961-1979      Baseball Boom
*1901-1920    Deadball Era                                       *1980-1992     Defensive Era
*1921-1945    Baseball's Rebirth                              *1993-2004      Power Years
*1946-1960    Golden Years                                      *2005-present  Modern Times

If you stay within the season, results are very good, but your managerial expertise can make a difference, although you won't take a 100 game losing team to the playoffs, or even .500.

Now if you want to use different teams within the SAME ERA in a custom league, you'll get some skewed results, as most people who do this don't include any second division teams. Therefore the game has to make a decision as to where each team will approximately finish, as someone has to finish last. The stats will also be skewed.

Where the stats REALLY get skewed is when you create a custom league of teams over a number of different eras. The game has to decide in any specific game, which era will be favored in the results. You can get some really far out results statistically doing this, as again players usually don't include second division teams, and someone has to finish last.

The OOTP player will find that the overall ratings of the in-game players can leave one scratching their head. In-game players are rated overall, and placed in 6 buckets(PP-Perfect Points):

*Entry level through Iron League       40-59  entry value: 5   PP         
*Bronze                                              60-69  entry value: 25 PP        
*Silver                                                70-79   entry value: 100 PP    
*Gold                                                 80-89   entry value: 1,000 PP
*Diamond                                          90-99   entry value: 4,000 PP
*Perfect                                             100      entry value: 10,000 PP

These overall ratings are supposed to give the OOTP player a numerical value of said in-game player. But you will find that there are Diamond level players, who can't hit better than a number of Gold level players; same with pitchers' ERAs. It can be frustrating to see a pitcher rated as a Bronze player with an ERA of 3.00, while another pitcher rated Diamond level has an ERA of 5.00+.and it isn't just in one year;It occurs frequently, especially in Perfect Team play.

If the OOTP player wants to create a Custom League, the best created leagues are Fictitious Leagues made up of Fictitious Players. Just make sure, in ANY league, you are the GM. DO NOT surrender that post to the AI, as it makes some very highly questionable moves. It does a good job of evaluating trades, and not making stupid ones FOR THE AI TEAMS! It DOES make stupid decisions for human controlled teams.

On another front, the best way to describe the Perfect Team aspect of the game is that it is PTW. An OOTP player cannot HOPE to advance past Silver level, unless they buy Perfect Points, and certainly cannot make it to Diamond level and higher and stay there, without a significant investment in those points. Perfect Players can range in price from 20,000 PP to 1,000,000 PP (this is NOT a typo). Perfect Points of 175,000 costs $100 USD. There are lower amounts, such as 25,000 for $20 USD. As you can see, you won't be buying many Perfect rated Players without a significant investment. Also, Perfect Teams CANNOT be imported from prior years. So all the effort the OOTP player went through to build a decent Perfect Team gets flushed when OOTP decides to close down the server for that iteration of the game.

TL,DR: If you want to see if you could, for example, have taken the 2016 Yankees to the World Series and beaten the Cubs for the title, this is the game for you. If you want to create a league made up of World Series Champions, and see how you do as manager, or want to develop the ultimate All Star team in Perfect Team, you will likely be met with frustration, especially without the significant investment in Perfect Points for Perfect Team.",1585797557,1585891134,TRUE,1,0,0.523809552,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,1032,25,5875,178,1311,1602041089,,

Why? OOTP 20 was supposed to feature new animations, among other things, that were pushed back and back and back, and never came. The mobile version, OOTP Go, was supposed to release just after the launch of '20, never happened. Still is not released. Even the tournaments IN Perfect Team were promised to be added within the first couple months of 20's launch. Guess what? They pushed it all the way back until November when they could no longer profit from new weekly 'special edition' cards and rating updates (making certain cards more and less viable). They have very obviously went down the ULTIMATE TEAM rabbit hole causing them to neglect everything else until the profits started to die down from the ""Updates"" ... hell, many bugs from 19 *and* 20 still have not been addressed in 21.

11,Out of the Park Baseball 21,66298090,english,"This is a tough game to review. Whether or not I recommend this to anyone all depends on what you want out of it. If you want to just simulate seasons and see what would theoretically happen if your build a team a certain way, I would strongly recommend this game. The long term stats of players and teams over the course of seasons and careers are put together pretty realistically, but that's also where I run into issues. 

It seems like the stats are more focused on long term play rather than short term play. If your'e like me and want to play out each game as a manager, you will see some really unrealistic things happen on a game to game basis. Because this game tries to simulate realistic stats over the course of a season, it will counteract statistical imbalances if your team is doing too well or too poorly. While this creates realistic numbers in the long run, this translates very poorly if you play out or watch each game.

I'm all for unpredictability, especially in a game that tries to mimic an unpredictable sport, but the flow of what happens and when it happens in this game is extremely awkward and way too forced in my opinion. So if you want to manage each game and try to make a strategical impact on a daily basis, I can not recommend this game at all. You will be too frustrated at the lack of control you have each game. But if all you want to do is change some rosters and lineups while sitting back and letting an entire season play out in minutes, I highly recommend this.

For a yearly-release game that has the developer size that OOTP does, they've made enough improvements over the last two iterations to keep me coming back, and engine improvements that they've made this year have made the loading times almost non-existent. 

For the core game, it's very similar to last year, but I really like the UI improvements and the scouting system gives me a little more control than in years past.

Perfect team is their version of Diamond Dynasty, or Ultimate Team, and it accomplishes a very similar goal to those programs, other than being able to actually play the games, which, to me, is a core element of a game mode like this.

PROS
- Perfect Team League (where you get to join others in simulated baseball game) is the main reason to get this game.  You get 5 or 6 random packs of cards and then you set your lineup and join the league.  Depending on your success you get to move up or down divisions while earning additional ""Perfect Points"" to bid on auctioned cards or purchase more packs.  Even if you don't get a lot of high rated cards, you can still be competitive by really looking at their stats, think Billy Beane baseball.  Dominant teams can lose or get swept regularly, similar to the real thing.
- Regular game: Trading seems realistic (unlike old EA Sports games) where the AI team will try to get the better of you in the deal or not trade at all. 
- Tons of stats, just like real baseball.
- Better this than hoping for MLB to start.

Cons
- Just a baseball SIM, so you don't get to play games, just make some managerial choices.
- Learning curve can be steep, lots of stats to look at, and even then you can still lose regularly.
- Several bugs listing team ranks and box scores.
- Some have complained about not being able to purchase Perfect Points (PP) (using your steam wallet).
- Smallest denomination of PP purchase is 1000 which is $1.  Each electronic pack of six cards cost 1000.
- Some people are hoarding in the auction and driving up prices which makes it more difficult for newbies to get good cards.",1585164279,1585164279,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,391,6,159178,12211,2963,1602048254,,

Marcus and his team do a great job of doing so much more than just a ""roster update"" like so many other big-name sports franchise titles.  They really listen to the community and continuously improve it with new features/functions driven by us, the consumers / fans.  The level of depth and accuracy with players, stats, scouting (from current live rosters and MiLB prospects) is incredible.  

Even before the addition of Perfect Team mode, this was the BEST baseball simulator hands down.  If you read any baseball trade mags like Baseball America, The New England Baseball journal, or find yourself spending time browsing fivethirtyeight.com or baseballreference.com a lot , this is the game for you.

At first you may feel a bit overwhelmed when you launch the game.  However, new this season (they listened to the community) and added ""Giant Green"" button so you don't get that feeling of drinking from a fire-hose when you open the game, and say ""Now what?""  Something I wish they had when I first started.

There is something for everyone in OOTP.  If you want to dip your toe in the water and do a bunch of offline games or leagues - you can - you want to simulate a tournament filled with your favorite franchises from past to present - and see who's the best you can.  You can do as much as you want or as little, that's the beauty of the game.  As you get more comfortable with it you will find yourself getting more and more involved in what you do.  If you're a fantasy baseball person, then joining an online league(s), or playing in Perfect Team might be a fit for you.  With a community of like minded people from around the world, you can find an online league that suites your needs from historical, modern, to totally fictional.

Not ready for an online league yet?  That's OK, Perfect Team might be more you style, its a little less imposing when you first launch it.  If you collected / traded baseball cards in your life - your gonna really enjoy this mode.  Its like collecting those baseball cards, forming your ""Perfect Team"" and then send them out to play against others in online leagues or tournaments.  Cards range from current MLBers, all they way back to the days of Honus Wagner & the Negro League baseball greats!  They really do their research on every card.  I've found myself learning about historical players I've never heard of before.  Each week they drop new content (cards).  They have weekly streams online to announce and review them. Too many great features to mention!

The game is only $40 when not on sale, a great bargain for the amount of enjoyment it will bring you.

If you have played OOTP previously, this years' version has a few noticeable differences. First, the scouting system has been completely revamped. You will actually have to pay attention to scouting reports, especially for draft picks you are potentially targeting, or a player you may be wanting to trade for.

However, it has been 20+ years since the inaugural game, and yet real-time online league capability is STILL not available. Come on, it is year 2020 and we are still manually importing & exporting excel sheets? Is this Stone Age?

At least learn something from that football managing game...... They have had LAN multiplayer function ever since 1999......

30,Out of the Park Baseball 21,65432129,english,"This version of the game tops last year’s on every front. The game is becoming more universally playable. The leagues outside of the manager/GM’s are more functional, the in-game graphic engine is getting some much needed attention (although it still has a long way to go to be compelling or invite users to watch highlights), and the general flow of a season has improved. OOTP 21 still has some interface issues that make it seem like an early 2010’s game but then again, it is mostly a text based game. I’m not that impressed with the Ballpark Creator they introduced this season but hopefully it will be a crowd pleaser. The new camera angles in the match engine are appreciated. The stats and info addition to the box score are exceptional. Despite all this, I don’t sense that I will be putting in serious hours and grinding through decades of a career. It’s not a home run of a game, more of a line-drive single. Continuing in this direction, The Grand Slam is 2-3 years away.

There are two major aspects that OOTP has over Football Manager and that’s the “newgen/regen” faces (player photos) are better (although OOTP faces do get a bit stale and could use a whole new crop) and that historical players/rosters can be uploaded. In future iterations of OOTP I would like to see a drop down menu of players that can be imported from the historical database. Not every gamer is going to have the wherewithal to go to a website and find the code of a player they want instead of just choosing from an in-game list. Another thing I would like to see re-hauled is the ‘Create-A-Player’ option. Currently in OOTP it’s just a roulette as to how talented a created player could be but I’d like to see a more in-depth option like in MLB The Show instead of a random addition to the free agent list. Why should I have to settle for a 2 star potential, when I clicked the ‘legendary’ option. Every custom player under legendary should be a 5 star potential or don’t bother offering any option there. Many people here carp about how the dev’s are focusing too much on Perfect Team and moving away from the main game. That’s fine because Perfect Team still needs a great baseball graphic engine, more realistic stadiums and better cameras. I will continue to buy the game despite the ‘thumbs down.’",1584747036,1584772941,FALSE,8,5,0.252822638,5,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,3,2,696,0,313,1595369294,,
