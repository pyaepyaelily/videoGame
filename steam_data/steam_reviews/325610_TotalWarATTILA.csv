19,76741813,english,"This might be the best of the Total War games in my opinion. I did not enjoy it in the beginning due to the complexity but once you learn how to play it is very addicting. If you want to play as either the WRE or ERE and are new to TW Attila, I recommend starting the Last Roman expansion first. You don't have to worry about city management and can just focus on the basics of running an army and fighting battles. 

I am going through a WRE campaign now and like how the difficulty keeps the campaign from being a simple map-painting exercise. When you take over in 395 AD the cities are underdeveloped, armies poor quality and understrength, the emperor is a chump, etc. Meanwhile your enemies are ready to bumrush and take advantage of your weaknesses. It reflects the period well where various tribes saw the weakness of the Romans and sought to exploit it. I am used to playing games where the Romans are the strongest but here you find other factions have more numerous and better quality troops in the beginning. You have to work hard to improve your military technology to get better units. Even your maxed out units are not best in class (found that out the hard way when my Herculani Seniores tried to fight a few Uar warriors straight up). You have to rely on tactics such as defensive formation, picking the right ground to defend a settlement - Hint... try to limit the directions from which the enemy can attack, and using combined arms tactics with your archers. I found the large onagers and ravenna elite crossbowmen a bit OP though.

Managing the military and social challenges is difficult enough but then Attila spawns with what seems like a million stacks of high-morale, high-quality troops. Europe also undergoes a climate change event where provinces produce less food. All of these obstacles make completing a campaign feel like a minor accomplishment even though it's just a video game haha. I think TW did a solid job covering Late Antiquity which is a very underrated time of history imo.

The only criticism I have is that the battle AI can be very dumb even at the higher levels. I have won many battles due to luck where the AI failed to flank my outnumbered forces and simply charged head on.

20,68057656,english,"Battles - 5/5
Naval battles - 5/5
Campaign - 4/5
Atmosphere - 4/5
DLCs - 4/5

- Yes this game feels like Rome 2.5 being built on the same engine with more or less the same assets. Yet there are many improvements in both land and naval battles and all nomadic factions have been significanly reworked. Playing as the horde or a migrating nation is a completely new total war experience.
- The campaign's atmosphere is unique, not at all like in Rome II. The Hunic horde is a real menace for every faction close to them or every bigger empire. You will also feel the slow descent of the world into darker and filthier times, as sanitation gets a greater role here and fertility level of the provinces will decreese over time. Yet again, I am forced to give the atmosphere 4/5 for female warriors implemented into the units. This time there are no purely female units, rather they have made some units mixed. I cannot consent to this in a historical game. But again I have to thank CA for allowing mods. Yes, many factions play similarely as this is reality not a fantasy game with mummies and lizard-people, but their starting conditions and location on the map with a combination of the unique traits make for a fun experience with all of them.
- The politics are similar in some ways to Rome II, but the political positions have been redone in more logical and fun way. Character leveling has also been made more comprehencible.

- The DLCs are awesome. The Last Roman and Age of Charlemagne are the best DLC content for a Total War ever.",1587906669,1601325273,True,2,0,0.527248859405517578,0,True,False,False,76561198030193228,130,96,10574,12,10574,1601072411,,

Táto recenzia je v Anglickom a Slovenskom jazyku:

Most games in the Total War series are very similar and have many positives and negatives in common. In my opinion, Attila is the best in the series, but the potential of the game is much greater and the game contains a few bugs and unintended things. The worst thing is the faulty mechanics of the game, which after the defeat of the Hun tribes immediately at the beginning of the next move will create a new fully armed army not far from the place of crushing defeat. I understand that Attila is a major part of the game, but the mechanics should either create an army in another remote location or create only a small and weak Hun army nearby. The historical significance of Attila is quite overestimated, because despite the enormous footprint they have left in history, they have spent most of their existence with only a small plunder of weaker opponents. Moreover, it was an ethnically diverse conglomerate of nations, where the Huns formed only a small socially dominant part. Additional campaigns purchased with downloadable content are even worse than the main part of the game in all the shortcomings mentioned. Downloadable content is not as expensive as other games, but its content are parts that I think should be part of the basic game (especially playable fractions). The company's policy in the Total War series is another reason not to buy any of their games. A series of Total War games has turned into a breeding farm! One game is not finished, it is full of mistakes and imbalances, but the company is already starting work on another game and no one will return to the previous one to fix it.

Väčšina hier zo série Total War sa na seba veľmi podobá a majú mnoho spoločných pozitív aj negatív. Attila je podľa mňa najlepší zo série, ale potenciál hry je oveľa väčší a hra obsahuje niekoľko chýb a nedomyslených vecí. Najhoršou vecou je chybná mechanika hry, ktorá po porážke Hunských kmeňov okamžite na začiatku ďalšieho ťahu vytvorí novú plne vyzbrojenú armádu neďaleko miesta zdrvujúcej porážky. Ja chápem, že Attila je hlavnou časťou hry, ale mechanika by mala, buď vytvoriť armádu na inom odľahlom mieste, alebo vytvoriť blízko len malú a slabú armádu Hunov. Historický význam Attilu je dosť preceňovaný, pretože aj napriek obrovskej stope, ktorú v dejinách zanechali, väčšinu svojej existencie strávili len drobným lúpením slabších súperov. Navyše išlo o etnicky rôznorodý konglomerát národov, kde Huni tvorili len malú spoločensky dominantnú časť. Dodatočné kampane zakúpené v rámci stiahnuteľného obsahu sú ešte horšie ako hlavná časť hry vo všetkých spomenutých nedostatkoch. Stiahnuteľný obsah síce nie je drahý ako pri iných hrách, ale jeho obsahom sú časti, ktoré by podľa mňa mali byť súčasťou základnej hry (najmä hrateľné frakcie). Politika spoločnosti v rámci série Total War je ďalším dôvodom, aby ste si žiadnu ich hru nekúpili. Séria Total War hier sa premenila na rozmnožovaciu farmu! Jedna hra nie je hotová, je plná chýb a nevyváženosti, ale spoločnosť už začína pracovať na ďalšej hre a k predošlej sa už nikto nevráti aby ju neopravil.",1549910415,1598958136,False,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False,76561198013759011,44,28,20139,0,20139,1581787181,,
23,75238675,english,"If you're new to Total War:
Recommend giving a different Total War a go first. This one can be a little spammy, and pretty gruelling - the campaign takes no prisoners. Try Rome 2 if you liked the visual style of this game but want a more rounded strategy experience, or Rome 1 / Medieval 2 if you want the absolute best of strategy this brand has to offer and don't care too much about the game being graphically impressive.

If you have played Total War before:
This is one of my favourites. It's not perfect by any means - the campaign can be gruelling, and it's frustrating to see the AI cheat quite so much sometimes (Doomstack of tier 3 units magically spawns 3 feet from one of your border settlements, can be a bit frustrating...). It can also be a bit spammy - often a gimmick spam army gives you better results than a balanced army, and the rosters are kinda geared that way. (e.g. the Alans are best played by just spamming cheap melee cavalry).
Pros though - the gruelling campaign captures what the developers were going for. It's meant to be dystopian. You're meant to feel the walls closing in. That doesn't take away from the campaign at all - if anything, it's much more interesting than the standard ""Everyone starts a bit weak and grows from there"" setup. You feel the desperation of being in a horde, or the chaos of the collapsing West. Is it truly representative of the death throes of Rome? Well, no, the year is all a bit wrong and it all happens a bit faster than reality, the 'norse' factions are just wildly out of place. (And the less said about berserking units the better.) But frankly, it's much more fun to play this way - it's meant to play like a mythical interpretation of the events, rather than to represent their reality. And Attila really captures the theme of dread and societal collapse. The music is excellent, probably my favourite soundtrack from the TW games, complete with throat singing to instill you with the mounting threat of the Hunnic Hordes. The visual style is also great, the darkness and gloom of the world you're in only ever broken by the bright flames of whole countries being literally burned to the ground. The battles are intense and swift, but also I feel give you more options with each unit than e.g. Rome 2 did. 

In short, if you enjoyed Rome 2, definitely give this one a go. It's a great follow-up.
If you enjoyed other TW games, give it a go if you're cool with pre-gunpowder, a bit of creative license doesn't bother you too much, you aren't a Rome 1 or Medieval 2 purist, and you like the idea of a more 'existential crisis' kind of campaign.
If you've never played TW, give a different one a go first. Rome 2, or Shogun 2, or maybe Napoleon.

DLC-wise, Last Roman can be alright, it's a fairly neat experience, whereas I found Age of Charlemagne to be a bit meh.",1598905083,1598905083,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198099778177,168,1,56088,92,54594,1602087189,,

59,74769952,english,"[h1]TLDR:[/h1]
Get Attila Total War if you want a unique entry in the franchise: grand strategy mechanics have been flipped from conquering to [b]survival[/b]. This change informs the bleak historical setting and audio-visuals of the game or perhaps vice versa. Mods turn a relatively rough vanilla product, by CA standards, into a great game. 

[h1]Positives:[/h1]

If Shogun 2 represents the quintessential total war experience, then Attila stands opposed to that tradition. Unlike Shogun 2 and other games in the franchise, Atilla does not want you to campaign and conquer--the game is not about unification or imperialism. Instead, the game is about [b]survival[/b], which is reinforced by the historical setting. The Huns are seeking food and glory; migratory tribes flee west of the Danube for shelter, Rome is fractured, famine and disease are rampant...

The historical theme of survival is well actualized in the gameplay. Eastern and Western Rome are vast, but your armies are few, and you will lose territory quickly to the migratory tribes and later the Huns. Migratory tribes begin as hordes that must colonize fertile provinces to survive. The Huns must survive by subjugating factions and fueling their armies with tribute--in turn gaining diplomatic penalties and constant hostility from everyone including their tributaries. The game is bleak and the design, sound, and setting reinforce it. 

[h1]Negatives and Troubleshooting:[/h1]

Conceptually this game is fantastic; however, I have to warn that gameplay heavily favors 'kiting' and is micro-intensive. Thankfully, there are several overhaul mods (with ongoing support) that balance and tailor the game to your liking. 
Also, the game needs some tweaking for optimization--mainly fixing framerate issues by lowering shadow quality to less than the highest and mods that edit the LOD ranges for units.",1598171842,1598171842,True,17,0,0.699243128299713135,0,True,False,False,76561198006937784,236,4,2949,0,1583,1599030863,,

78,74517531,english,"Honesty one of my least favourite of the Total Wars. Which makes me sad as I desperately want to like it. It has a lot going for it, taking the framework of Rome 2 (Which was dismal on release but eventually reached the giddy heights of basically ok), and sets itself at the fall of the Western Roman Empire. It does feel somewhat reminiscent of the old expansion pack for Rome 1, although more like a full fledged game rather than a mere expansion. It has a lovely dark colour palette, some amazing fire effects, and a lot of effort has gone into fleshing out the various factions. The Sassanids in particular feel a lot more like the rival empire they are supposed to be and less like a tiny faction struggling to survive at the edge of the map. Sieges are decent, you are actually reliant on siege engines and can't just swarm the walls with every infantry unit you have (please stop giving every infantry unit invisible ladders CA, it makes walls irrelevant) and even have random civilians running around throwing rocks at the invaders. The whole tone feels darker, and you even have to deal with a cooling climate on top of everything else. On a whole they have tried to make it a lot more interesting experience than the previous game. But maybe that's where the issues start.
Rome 2's biggest issue for me is that it's far too easy. It seems that once you get to a certain point fairly early in the game, you have reached critical mass and no other faction in the game can ever meaningfully threaten you again. You essentially become the order tide from warhammer 2, and the game turns into a ""paint the map"" simulator as a result. Attila seems to have been designed with the intent to counteract this, and they seem to have swung too far in the opposite direction, with pretty calamitous results. There are the Huns, but I'll save them for later, my biggest issue is actually the management. It legitimately feels as if the entire settlement management system has been reworked to stifle growth and to slow down the player as much as possible. Settlements don't have very many build slots, and almost every building that you can build will give you a negative buff, consuming food, upkeep or leading to squalor. The small number of build slots means that it's quite difficult to balance these effectively, and even in the event that you do you are going to be extremely limited in what else you can build. Public order seems to be particularly hard to manage (This issue was also very prevalent in thrones of Britanna for a long time) and this results in a vast amount of the game being you simply sitting your armies in a settlement, sometimes for twenty to thirty turns waiting for public order to stabilise, before briefly hopping out to fight a battle or two before turning tail and running for home. If you actually do manage to conquer a region, prepare for even more sitting around consolidating. There's always been an element of this in most total war games, but it feels like it's taken much too far in this one. I attempted a campaign as the Irish, and after conquering britain in the first 5 hours spent the next 10 sitting there doing nothing but maintaining public order and waiting, either for population to grow enough to build something, or for a plague to go away so I can actually move my army. End turn and loading times are obnoxiously long, either due to CA not wanting to invest time patching an unpopular game, or because Deathmaster Snikitch is in no hurry to deliver a potion of speed to the Ro-man things! Let them die-die! I think I fought maybe two battles in 7 of these hours, the last three were spent with the game's other big issue.
The huns. I hate Huns. My Father hated them too, even before they put out his eyes. 
The Huns are the midgame crisis (The endgame being the Sassanids and their twenty vassals who don't get attacked by the Huns and so always survive, then devour most of the map), and I hate their implimentation with a flaming passion that outmatches that of Attila on his wedding night. Remember the Warriors of Chaos, and how easy it actually is to defeat them? Well whoever designed the Huns thought it would be a sterling idea that, every time you destroy a Hunnic army, a fresh one will appear where it died the next turn. Stop, read that again. I wish I was joking. Kill the Hun, another identical hun appears where he dies. If that didn't already sound stupid enough, they also stop your troops replenishing when you are in their provinces, so there is seemingly very little point in fighting them at all, as you get very quickly worn down whilst they take no damage whatsoever. The only reasonably safe strategy is to defeat their armies but not destroy them, but CA also decided to give the Hunnic units absurdly high morale (as well as many giving your own units fear penalties) so this is a lot easier said than done. Even then the tattered army will only slink off, hire mercenaries and come for you again. The only way to beat this is to either pick Attila out of the 12 or so stacks and kill him four separate times (he can be assassinated some of these but not all) or hope to outlast him. Or play as the Sassanids who don't get invaded, have a sanitation bonus that means they are a lot less pemalised when expanding, so just sit on your backside then steamroll the ruined map. Needless to say it is the very definition of artificial difficulty, and it means even if you can get through everything else you get nothing but a very absurd and arbitrary challenge, and surviving it means nothing but getting steamrolled by the Persians.
So, in conclusion, of all the total wars, do not touch. It's the only one which I can tar with the dirtiest brush available to me as a random joe who writes reviews about games he plays. It's boring. The combination of the sitting around and the long turn times make it a chore to play, and the mid and end game just add nihilism and almost inevitable defeat, so you can suffer through all of that boredom for nothing.
However, I will say, the two DLC campaigns are legitimately quite good. If per say, you were to get it on sale to play the last roman or the excellent christopher lee simulator, that would justify the purchase. Stay safe fellow romans! It lives on in our hearts!

The Battle UI is unsightly.

Yeh, rome 2 is good on the campaign screen, but the battles are slow due to this feature also.
Warhammer 2 is honestly the best Title this franchise has. (no LOTR mods though, so M2 still is the best)

Extraordinary Modding community with great overhauls and time setting changes such as Terminus: Imperium, Ancient Empires or Medieval Kingdoms 1212. 
Many quality of life mods around, people have some usefull collections to make even the original setting more interesting. 

Great dlc, generally the added cultures have strenghts and weaknesses that are remarkable and have an unique playstyle. Great expansions with Age of Charlemagne being one of the best campaing expiriences aviabale, very new player friendly in comparison to the vanilla campaing. If you are picking it up be sure to get either the briton or viking culture packs to have a enjoyable first campaing as most factions in vanilla are sorrounded by enemies and constant war, which can be overwhelming for new players, specially such complex factions like Western Roman Empire or the Huns.

CA should revisit this game and make official the import of Thrones of Britannia optimizations, which would fix 90% of the major stuttering and big battle problems that this game has. 

Second best behind Medieval 2, and its clear successor in terms of modding community, only shadowed by the incredible rise of the Warhammer games that have a modding community equally strong , and even bigger. Graphics and effects hold up to this day and there are many great modded texture packs that increase quality and variety even more.

I recommend this game to people who have already played other total wars and dont mind a more challenging expirience, with extraordinarilly agressive AI only matched by Rome 2 recent dlc and patches ( that take many mechanics from Attila I might add).

I suppose my issue is that these are the mechanics that, for me, give the game replayability, rather than the real-time battles (that said, M2TW battles still feel much more satisfying than this or any other TW's). Many mods, of course, are incredibly fun, but even very polished ones like 1212AD seem to eventually hit a wall when they try to change key mechanics, or introduce new ones (and old ones, left unchanged, can still annoy the player from time to time). I should note I have been playing these games mostly on an old laptop, and I feel the new titles in particular (ETW-onwards) would be much more appreciable in a proper gaming computer, to show off unit design, scale, etc... so it would also be fair to say I haven't played the game ""as it is supposed to be played"", a bit like watching LOTR on a phone...",1596761302,1596761302,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198028748960,32,16,21763,0,21763,1596759386,,

The real struggle of reviewing Attila is that I really really love the game. But I almost can't get myself to say it because this game is so obviously a step in a direction that and old-school total war fan simply cannot appreciate. But let me get to the point. The reasons why I love Attila and why I'll definitely play another campaign or three:
- The map is huge
- Diplomacy is solid
- Unit roster is amazingly diverse, including a wide range of mercenaries
- Huns are such a dark and threatening menace. I always sh*t myself when I see their army of Devil Archers approaching.
- I LOVE razing and colonising settlements
- Battle AI is above-average
- Battle maps and battle mechanics are original and fresh. You can see how much ammunition enemy units have left. You can build barricades, set stuff on fire etc.
- Amphibious battles
- City building is good
- Interesting internal politics mechanics
- A very tangible era-ending atmosphere
- A lot of playable factions

Reasons why I won't play another five or ten campaigns (like I did in Shogun 2 or Medieval 2):
- Campaign AI is below-average (seriously, running away with your superior army into the hills and letting me take your cities?)
- Graphics has taken an unfortunate step back. Heck, even water looks worse than in Shogun 2!
- Just like in Rome 2, you can't have armies without commanders. Furthermore, the number of armies you can weild is capped. Can only weild 5 armies but have 6 border settlements? Sorry! You'll have to make do somehow. This is a slap in the face to any strategy game enthusiast. Why in the world can't I transfer units from one army to another without moving the ENTIRE army?!
- Traits development for characters seems even more random than in Medieval 2
- Weird agent development trees. Each agent has ten or more abilites, most of which are useless.
- Weird religion traits/benefits. Was Christianity really so useless back then?
- Nonsensical city building mechanics. Why in the world are fields lowering public order? ""Damn, I'm so pissed at those f****g wheat farms over there!""
- Really, graphics is much weaker than in older titles! Zooming in on battles is far less satisfying than it used to be.
- DLCs. Want all the factions? Pay up (and not once!). Want blood in this military strategy game? Pay up. (To be fair, those burned corpses look awesome... but why do I gotta pay 5 euros for that?)

There it is. I'd give Attila a solid 8/10. Good game, but lacking. Lacking in things that could be very easily fixed.
Overall a good choice for any Total War lover who loves ancient era but can't stand Rome 2.

Tribes can now migrate somewhere else after being beat out of their settlements. Some tribes can resettle, like the huns. I beat 8  hun armies and they kept appearing, i beat 6 more.

They burned down entire northern europe and the only thing standing was the middle east and some remaingin settlements in europe. I was the richest obviously and they woudln't stop coming. I had to quit that campaign for this reason. Infinite hordes isn't gameplay it is torture. I just play with tribes not located in europe to avoid the huns and now the game is fine.

But you can't really enjoy it much when every battle turns into a slideshow. You can improve it by turning down the graphical settings (specially shadows) but then it looks really bad. There are some performance mods that make it more bearable by tweaking LOD but it's not enough.

99,73025828,english,"Total War: Attila is an underrated game. TW: Attila is unbalanced , ugly and not all that optimized. However, it is a unique game that is the most difficult in the franchise. 

TW: Attila is completely unbalanced. The game is supposed to be based around counters, but horse archers and shock units are the meta of the game. Charge bonuses wipe out units with only a few charges and horse archers can reduce most units to nothing. The meta is an insane competition between shock armies and horse archers. This however is undermined by the [i]Slavic Nations Culture Pack[/i] and its addition of poison arrows. Poison arrows have largely broken the fun meta by countering everything with a play-style that encourages camping. Poison arrows are not an issue in the single-player due to their obscure position on the map and proximity to the Huns. However, the meta of shock units and horse archery will dictate how you make your armies.

This game is ugly but that is not too much of an issue. The theme of the game's art style is degeneration and the ugly textures support this style. This theme of degeneration permeates the whole game and creates a strangely immersive experience. The ugliness of this game could be an issue for some people. 

TW: Attila is a poorly optimized game. Despite looking ugly, the game lags and crashes even on a system with decent specs. 

The most difficult challenge in Total War is featured in TW: Attila. The Western Roman Empire campaign can be cheated and cheesed, but nothing compares to defending the empire the way it was intended by the developers. Pretty much every faction in this game is challenging because every faction is threatened by roving hoards without settlements that like to raze cities to the ground. Climate change, sanitation and religion are not easy to deal with and cause economic troubles and chaos. Attila the Hun himself will spawn infinite armies until he is killed three times in battle. Very few Total War games are this challenging. 

TW: Atilla is a broken game but it's the right kind of broken.

2,72973019,english,"Think I have enough in game time to do a review now.

If your looking at this to be a copy of Rome 2 Total War, stop right there, because its not. Its based on a different time period leading into the medieval ages and its got a whole different global setup. That being the climate shift which changed the soil a bit, and also the introduction of christianity to the world, where before it was pure paganism.

The city defenses are a lot different in this one because a lot of the settlements appear to share a similar layout, and that layout has a clear benefit to the defender, which is not a bad thing seeing as most places were built with defense in mind.

I do suggest playing with a few mods though, since if you play Rome it can be really brutal trying to survive the hoards of everyone throwing themselves at you mixed with soil that turns into wasteland irregardless of your irrigation and farming technology the Romans spent hundreds of years developing. So having a mod that adds buildings that increase fertility makes sense.

Troops wise, the Romans seem to have the advantage in terms of heaviness, however one thing you will notice is that regardless of your clear advantage, the game will say its even or your losing, when your really winning, maybe its a glitch in the game.

Overall, its a good total war game, but don't go in expecting it to mirror other total wars, its a different game in and of its self.",1595199653,1595199653,True,3,0,0.514446258544921875,0,True,False,False,76561198007273581,222,23,6657,0,6507,1595381970,,

47,72308159,english,"This is, without a doubt, the best [u]historical[/u] TW game I've ever played. Now before you start screaming ""heresy"" allow me to explain why:
Attila is a darker version of Rome 2, most of the mechanics are fairly similar between the two but with Attila instead of being a Rome conquest game its much more about the decline of Rome and that can be seen in the game: Settlement razing - You can raze enemy settlements or you can even choose to raze your own settlements in order to launch a scorched earth campaign against the enemies at the gates.
The combat feels really great, cavalry charges and flanks are devastating, infantry combat from the front is slow. There's no more magic satellite link-up guided arrows from Shogun 2. Ranged units just feel much better than Rome 2. The fatigue system is neat in that you can cycle units in and out of combat to rapidly return to fresh.
The long term fertility situation, sanitation vs public order vs food, politics, offices and other systems are involved and feel really fun to manage once you understand them.
There is also the horde mechanic which can make things interesting. The Huns are a purely horde faction who have limited economic prospects beyond sacking and/or razing enemy settlements or maintaining a large number of vassal barbarian tribes. The Barbarians can also choose to pull up stakes, abandon their provinces and migrate elsewhere to avoid the Huns and perhaps better attack the Romans who can be sitting ducks.
by the way, the 5th Century doesn't interest you? Try the Age of Charlemagne DLC or the 1212AD Mod. You don't like historical TW and for whatever reason you don't want to play TW Warhammer? this game even has Lord of the Rings mod lmao.
HOWEVER, why people are so negative about Attila you ask? Because it forced players out of their comfort zone, they don't like the lack of food penalties, the diseases and climate change mechanic, Attila (compare to other TW) is a survival game not an empire building game. If other Total War games are ''haha map painting go brrrr'' this game is ""live to fight another [i]turn[/i]"".

This is a review of a naive fan of Total War; who has not been able to discern the corruptable forces of CA, until now.

If you are looking for a game of graphics, thank you Total War, this game will suit that. Rome II or Shogun II accomplish the same, and I find to be definitely better; gameplay-wise. However, there are some underlying factors that should steer you away from this game:

1. DLC is King! ""No seriously.... Just give them your money. Its fine, all of our DLC's worth it!"" (Says every CA spokesperson, who doesn't need to pay for it).

2. Random bugs. This is minor in theory, however when you start noticing the same bugs.... It doesn't feel minor... This is an another gripe against CA as I seem to find these bugs in their last 2 titles apart from Attila, and no Facks were given on any day to fix them... Look forward to Warhammer!

3. Pricing of this title. I would not recommend it, again, you can achieve feel and looks in past games, especially since they cost less than this.

4. DLC is beautiful, again! ""I mean come on, we can release this shit like clockwork, and they'll [consumers] never know! Pre-release DLC and DLC just weeks after the game is released? With no differences amongst these packs? Fuck yeah! Additionally, we'll throw in little details like blood and vomit... That will make panties fall! People [consumers again] WILL LOVE THIS."" Impersonated CA workers conversing at final release development. -- Understand that pre-release DLC is already made game content prior to release, which means that it was made with the base game, they only separated the two to make more money.

5. AI are about the same as past Total War games. Attila's AI... May be more dumb than the wiseguy at CA who thought DLC was a good idea. AI is not too difficult to beat, however you need to do it in certain ways, which eliminates certain play styles (unless you mod).

6. This is a conclusive observation. Although the graphics are amazing, and the ideas behind this game are interesting; this game is a reskin of Rome II at its finest. The multitude of redundant factions shows carelessness on the developers behalf. DLC prior to first day is something I have always been against (which is why I DID NOT pre-order this game (not that naive)), and should steer clear from unless certain criteria is met. That criteria is price; this is too much outright, so buy everything on sale if you are hellbent on being interested in this game.

Overall, I will still play this game, as I like the graphics and the time period that this game is set in. However, will I support anything else from CA and Total War? That will have reside on the outcome of what happens with upcoming games, such as Warhammer (which is not looking good from what I have seen).",1451530188,1593500376,False,6,0,0.551375925540924072,0,True,False,False,76561198069745836,181,8,19455,0,5458,1593587854,,

However having finally come back to it, and to play West Rome proper, I must say it's the best one to do date, and although I would suggest getting it on sale, I had no regrets getting it at full price, I would say it is even better than Three Kingdoms, and Warhammer 2, the latter game I have been playing a lot and really enjoying too. What makes it better is the combat in this game feels really really good, I would say even better than Shogun 2. 

You can have battles where you may only have a 10% chance of winning and tactics actually favour the victor, as opposed to other games in the series where even if you are smart morale debuffs are way too effective, in this game they are their but feel fair, fitting of a game where you are instantly put on the back pedal having to defend your land from a number of factions (if playing as Rome). Makes unlikely defences really fun to play, as opposed to just auto resolving and giving up, all be it that still happens once and a while either due to personal negligence of looking after land or just not caring about every single province.

Besides the combat, the feeling and setting is really unique, and for sure feels different, if not scary and lonely at times, but in a good way really keeps you feeling like each turn is another step in your factions survival during a period of change, eradication, and chaos.

Units are balanced well, there's overlap here and there but I honestly like it, since I hate the syndrome of having to memorize [insert local cultural name for spear militia] and then compare the stats to my units, it's somewhat straightforward. The only problem in my opinion is...

Well, the siege battles. They're amazing, the best in the franchise, but oh my God. You will fight on the same map 590 times, you will memorize the best way to deal with ANYONE, from MP to SP, and you will dominate, my favorite lategame strategy for defense being crossbow+barricade, which is just a fancy way to delete infantry units.

Cataphracts are awesome, and awe-inspiring. I don't care if they technically aren't ""meta"" compared to Tagmata, but roaming the Sassanid Empire and pulling an Operation: Desert Storm with two stacks of heavy cav is just damned sexy. Eastern Rome has probably the best unit roster just for aesthetic mods alone.

My only complaint is that while great, the game is poorly optimized and the Blood DLC... That's always a problem.",1592125844,1592125844,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198134702809,259,72,13846,0,13805,1598241869,,

3,43266767,english,"So, what can I say about this game? In general, it's pretty interesting. The battles scales are actually impressive. It's guite amusing to develop your tribe, capture new lands, and so on. The politiccal system has both pros and cons. 

First of all, what the hell? If you have almost demolished an enemy state, its rulers in theory should give you their best to save the state. But enemies either offer pathetic 300 coins or refuse any your offers. 

Nevertheless, the system is actually good. You have a lot of options. You can conclude a non-aggression pact, make a defensive alliance, make an alliance, give money to other tribes, demand money from them and so on. And each your decision is very important. So, if you made a lot of unnecessary alliences, you will paid for this. You will have to fight with other tribes because of your ally. And the ally itself may not to fight, because it has unleashed a war with a tribe, which is situated too far. Why do allies do this? Nobody knows. But it has a bad effect on your economy and public order. So you should think before make an alliance. 

Secondly, the economic system. It's very strange. A region may have either surplus food or lack.. If a region has a lack, it's bad because people starve and it has a bad effect on the public order (by the way, an important thing). But when the state as a whole has an excess food, a region may have a lack. Really. For example, you have three regions. Two of them have an excess food, but the last one a lack. And extra food cannot be sent to this region because... because what? Nobody knows. So, each region supplies itself.

What about other aspects of economics? I like them. Have you found a source of resources? It's good. You can trade the resources you found. Moreover, the resources allow you to build some buildings. If a trade route is under attack, your tranding income falls. 

To sum up, this is a casual game. It might seem that the game quite difficult but actually when you play a bit, you will get used.

4,69128225,english,"Total War: Attila 

This game follows historically with Total War: Rome 2. We progress a few hundred years and see the fall of the roman empire after it has split between east and west. The game changes a lot for the series and many of the mechanics from this game have found their way into the Warhammer games.

As usual for creative assembly, a lot of the game is delivered piece-meal through DLC. Many factions are locked into DLC culture packs you have to purchase if you want to play anything beyond the bigger empires.

One of the best changes is the creation of Hoards or free-roaming armies that are not anchored to any city. The mongols are the best example. They can never settle in a city and must always stay nomadic. Then you have the Barbarians Hoards that are fleeing the mongols. These are the Ostro/Visigoths who invade and settle the collapsing roman territory. They are all about getting strong, then taking land. 

The units are interesting, but there is not a whole lot of difference in units between cultures. They tend to play more like re-skins and are class based, but there is way more variety than Shogun 2.

I think this is one of there best historical themed games, but it tends to be ignored in favor of Rome 2.",1589474414,1589474414,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198002145115,295,6,12057,0,12057,1589377695,,

I love this game, it was truly the last genuine historical total war. The game is fun and beautiful. It has one of the most groundbreaking and popular total war mods ever made for it. It's historically accurate and the graphics are still beautiful even by today's standards. However the reason I had to click not recommend is something I can't fault this innocent amazing game for. CA completely abandoned it. It is truly a shame, because this was their last great historical game before jumping the shark, but instead of continuing to work with what is arguably one of their masterworks, they dived headfirst into the pool of greed and left this on the diving board. If CA had continued to work with this, who knows what we could have gotten, instead they killed it and went on to make games solely for the purpose of making money for themselves instead of giving the fans what they want and deserve. It makes me really sad what happened to the creative assembly. This game is beautiful and is still worth playing but it's a testament to how horribly derailed CA has become and angered the fanbase by abandoning this poor amazing game.

But ATTILA is one of the best TW games available.
I dont like three kingdoms as much; I dont like shogun2 as much (though its pretty close); I dont like rome2 as much. Oh and forget about the ""saga"" games, they are basically ""half TW games"". I dont count those.
If you have ANY TW games, you first need medieval2 obviously (#1) - but for 2nd and 3rd I would take ATTILA and WARHAMMER2.

Its cheap now.
The DLC are optional.
Theres great mods for it.
Pretty simple choice here: if you like this genre, you need this game.

56,21132820,english,"I don't recommend it, even though I've only played it twice as the Western Roman Empire campaigns. Several reasons why I don't recommend it are.....
1. It isn't optimized well and the custom settings are somewhat confusingly named, which made it difficult for me to adjust them.

2. It makes my laptop hot when it shouldn't, RTW2 ran just fine, but my fans were constantly blowing at full speed while playing this.

3. It feels like too much of a grind. I had to constantly fight manual battles in order to make the attacking hordes take more casualties than they would have if I had simply auto-resolved. Doing that multiple times for the first 50 turns or so became annoying and felt like a chore.


4. It felt kind of pointless. I managed to kill Attila and received no cinematic or message, he was just dead. I destroyed the remaining hordes and simply got the message that the Huns had been destroyed, the same message that I got when the other factions got destroyed. 
It didn't seem worth it in the end. After I restored public order, rebuilt cities, got food and sanitation up in all provinces, secured the borders, destroyed enemies...It just seemed like it went from frustrating and grind-like to pointless to continue playing, all while my laptop was hot with fans blowing. 

Updating review: I've been playing it a bit more and have found the game somewhat more enjoyable, but I do not know how much longer this enjoyment will last. I noticed that if I put everything on performance or even max performance, the game runs a lot better. I guess performance is like saying ""low settings."" There were some other things that I unchecked like shadows that also made the game run smoother. 
All that being said, I assume the game has little replay value since the Huns are always going to be the main enemy, but I'm not sure how the DLC for Attila is yet.

so first of all this will be review of mod that you can use for Attila. I buyed this game for this mod only and played game just with 1212AD mod and dont have a single minute with base story of game. The 1212AD mod is FREE so keep that in mind!!

As all total war players i am waiting for Total War Medieval III. When will it come? i dont know...but until then i am playing 
MK 1212AD. It is almost like beta of Medieval III. Mod is looking great and preforms great in game. Factions are accurate and have accurate historical units. Units looks so great, i can just say good job to guy who desing units. I like how you can go on crusade, it feels so realistic. Game as Attila si runnig poorly...but that its not mod fault. Also game is to dark for me so is not right theme for medieval time...which again is game's fault. all i can say this is the only way for you to play while you wait for Total War Medieval III. 

Now i will try to tell some downside of mod, which I DONT KNOW IF IS EVEN MOD FAULT!!! 
first thing that it's bothers me is that there is very few settlements... as we know in medieval era there was a lot of factions in europe and so one of those factions comes in game with only one settlement. that means when i take that only settlement i destroy faction and then i feel odd becasue there were many more lords in factions which would came to aid in real life. But this is not a mod fault!(i think) this can be used as something for Total War Medieval III, to make it more fun. 
Looks of the Castles is also something that does not belongs in that era but i dont know if thats even posible to change in game. 

Other than that the mod is life saver!! Try to donate to modders if you can cause they gave you for FREE Total War Medieval III Beta.

12,68361854,english,"Recommended with a number of caveats. 

I'm a longstanding total war fan and started playing Attila just recently because I found myself captivated with the Late Roman Imperial period. It's a time of turmoil and tragedy for the Romans. A dying of the light, as darkness comes from both within and without. Fighting back against the darkness and halting the Roman collapse is what interested me here, and if you share that interest then this game may be for you.

As for the actual mechanics and content, it is very much Rome II with some interesting additions and some further polish. Compared to other total war games, the quality and variety of the battles is enjoyable. The siege battles are very interesting and cool, and it's certainly also nice to be able to play naval battles and have them connect to land battles. The characters system is also quite well fleshed out, and there are plenty of ways to get attached to your favorite characters with all their positive and negative traits.

The main issues I have with the game come in two categories. Firstly the AI issues and secondly the ""Modern Total War"" issues.

AI problems are easy to describe, basically this refers to the strange and stupid ways in which the AI will behave. In field battles this is less pronounced as the AI generally employs quite competent and aggressive tactics. The AI generally also defends settlements very well, but as an attacker it generally performs very poorly, getting its generals killed and armies routed. The campaign map AI is the worst failure in this category. In diplomacy and army movement it seems more interested in infuriating and annoying the player faction rather than building its own power, such as when factions refuse to trade or surprise attack you to sack one settlement only to then be crushed by your much more powerful armies. The only way to play is to treat every faction as a potential enemy and never leave a frontier unguarded. All of the AI's nonsensical campaign plays are facilitated by the bonuses that the AI gets to its finances and empire maintenance. It feels incredibly frustrating to be the victim of unfair AI strategies that would get the player killed if they attempted them.

Lastly we have a bunch of issues that irritate me as a fan of total war classics like medieval 2. In no particular order, these are: Building slot restrictions, army stack limits, shared province wide resources and public order, the politics system, the recruitment system and the technology tree. Some of these mechanics impose artificial and annoying restrictions, while others attempt to add depth to the campaign while only making it more tedious and time sink like. In my mind the game suffers from these issues to a degree, but thankfully not enough to prevent me from enjoying it.

So if you like the time period and are able to overlook the issues, enjoy this fun and expansive Late Imperial Roman sandbox.",1588336330,1588336330,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197987602459,488,14,2607,0,1944,1588487695,,

16,68353800,english,"I honestly think this would be one of the best Total War games out there if CA hadn't botched the game's optimization. The vanilla campaign can be very challenging. Mechanics like governorship and a more in-depth internal policy makes this more immersive than Rome 2, if you ask me. Siege battles are great, especially due to the well made custom/specific settlements (Yes, you can defend/siege the Theodosian walls of Constantinople). 

Overall, if you exclude the optimisation issue and the time setting, this is what Rome 2 should have been. It's a shame that CA didn't give this game the same post-launch attention it gave Rome 2, especially in terms of optimization.  

Lastly, the mod support is great! Two especially good mods are Medieval Kingdoms 1212 and Ancient Empires, which are set in the medieval period and the 2nd Punic War, respectively. 

The game has its flaws, like the previously mentioned bad optimization.

24,68278814,english,"One of my favorite games in the Total War franchise thus far, and a huge improvement on its predecessor, Total War Rome II. Attila takes essentially the same engine and incorporates a new set of mechanics and flavor that perfectly suit the transition from early to late antiquity. The doomsday vibe of the game's sparse narrative helps to ground its sandbox in the psychological space of its setting: the end of the Roman world and the beginning of a new era. This game is essentially a spiritual sequel to Total War Rome: Barbarian Invasion, with the migratory tribes and the Huns stealing the show in both aesthetics and mechanics.

If you played the Nomadic Tribes DLC for Rome II, you might have been disappointed at the lack of ""Barbarian Invasion"" style nomad mechanics, leaving them with the same city-based gameplay as sedentary civilizations. Attila makes up for this in droves, with a massively expanded nomad migration system that's tremendously fun to play compared to settled states. This is why the Great Migrators (think Goths, Franks, Alans, and Vandals) are at the center of the game, with the formidable Huns driving them westward into the ill-defended Roman territory. All these factions have no cities at the start, but instead carry their cities with them as mobile army encampments that can be packed up and moved on the fly (with construction pausing while the army is on the move and resuming when they encamp). Unlike the Huns, though, the migrators are not locked into staying nomadic: their goal is to raid their way into settled territory until they find a good place to settle down and create their own kingdom. This gives an otherwise sandboxy game a firm sense of goal and direction, whether you want to recreate the historical path of your tribe's rise to power, or change history and make them outlast their real-life counterparts.

The player who wants to face a near-impossible challenge also has the option of playing as the Western Roman Empire and trying to prevent its fall, but as they have a massive amount of territory to defend, they will have to pick and choose what parts of the empire are most important to hold onto. Eastern Rome (aka the Byzantines) is a more realistic challenge for players who aren't quite so masochistic, as for them one merely has to recreate their historical survival, though against they won't be likely to come out with their empire intact.

As for the tactical battles, Attila rebalanced the system of Total War Rome II to better fit the time period and make for more dynamic gameplay. Unit morale is much more of a factor, as all but the best trained units will rout under sufficient pressure from the enemy (or if you accidentally throw them into friendly fire), though they may also regroup and return to the battle if their casualties aren't too severe. There are more dramatic differences between factions as well, so for example migrating nomads cannot capture buildings, only destroy them. Overall, the battles in Attila feel more fluid than previous titles, and it's much more possible to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat, or vice versa...

Both battle and campaign maps are rendered in gorgeous detail even on medium settings. As the fifth century goes on, the map will actually change over time. The onset of climate change, which rendered the northern regions inhospitable during this time period, is reflected in the reduction of regional fertility and increasingly barren land. Speaking of which, the land is also likely to suffer from invaders razing settlements, which not only wipes them off the map but also burns and desolates the entire region with a glorious animation sequence that leaves the trees burned and the territory uninhabited.

Major political features have fleshed out the campaign as well. You can now assign governorships to your leaders (a feature appallingly absent from Rome II's unwieldy and unfinished politics system), and you can distribute other offices to worthy characters in your employ, so long as keep an eye on their loyalty to make sure they don't become too ambitious for their own good. Religion is also a part of the game's mechanics for the first time as well, replacing the culture spread from Rome II, and dynamically changing over time as you construct religious buildings and proclaim edicts. This opens up the possibility for the player to create their own goal of spreading their faction's religion across the entire map, or perhaps preserving a historically embattled religion from this period, like Arianism or one of several Pagan faiths. Tying into this, faction and unit voice callouts will often reference their faction's religion, which adds to the flavor of an era in which religious motivations played a large role in military morale.

There's definitely a lot more I want to explore in this game, but already it stands out to me as one of the most interesting titles in this series to date, and one that has aged relatively well compared to its predecessor. It's a shame there's only two DLC campaigns, compared to the massive number of interesting scenarios available for Rome II, but there are some excellent total conversion mods available on the Steam Workshop that help scratch that itch for more historical content. I would argue that Attila is the gold standard of comparison for future TW titles and fans of the series should definitely consider picking it up.",1588220531,1588220531,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198008667586,553,12,3201,0,955,1600794071,,

First, the elephant in the room: ‘Attila’ is poorly optimized, to the extent that it runs worse than its predecessor Rome 2 (or at least, worse than Rome 2 in its current, final, ‘Emperor Edition’ state).

We’re talking half the frame rate of R2 with equivalent graphics settings - and the Attila engine is evidently unable to take advantage of the brute power of modern graphics cards to get itself out of trouble - so don’t think that this warning doesn’t apply to you just because you have a modern GPU. 

At best, your Nvidia 2060 will allow you to add 8x AA and x16AF, SSAO, DoF and maybe distortion effects (i.e. aspects of rendering internal to the GPU) while the game waits for your CPU to compute shadows, unit detail, trees, grass, terrain i.e. whatever game assets are hardcoded to be handled by the processor only.

Having said that, ‘poorly optimized’ does not mean ‘broken’: the game is stable to the extent that I can’t recall any crashes. So it’s a question of what you as a player are prepared to put up with: this is a game that struggles to run its own internal benchmark - a short scenario featuring less than twenty units - satisfactorily on maximum settings; so it’s really no wonder that siege battles featuring four full stacks degenerate into slide-shows. 

As a result, I have found myself autoresolving multi-army siege battles that I would otherwise have enjoyed - a sad thing to say about a game in which epic confrontations should be the highpoints of a playthrough, not an ordeal to be sidestepped.

Ok, on to the game itself:

Attila was the first recent TW game to reintroduce the horde mechanic, whereby some factions don’t have any settlements but instead camp wherever the hell they like, a mechanic which increases scope for creative playstyles. Moreover it adds a new dimension even if you don’t play as a horde yourself, since dealing with hordes is a new challenge for settled factions too; and if you lose your last settlement, you may find yourself playing as a horde after all!

The new ability to 'raze' (obliterate) captured settlements also adds creativity, since the player (and the AI too) now has the option to delete entire cities from the map rather than overextend their empire by capturing them, or risk having to return at some point after merely 'sacking' them - now there is a more permanent solution available. 

This can be used to create buffer zones of inhospitable wasteland around your core provinces; or (Attila allows you to abandon i.e. raze your OWN settlements) in desperate circumstances you can employ a 'scorched earth' policy to deny an advancing enemy the benefit of the region they are about to capture.

The option to 'recolonise' abandoned/razed settlements, though costly in men and gold, provides a means for players with the necessary funds to snap up some of the devastated real estate left in the Huns' wake (providing, that is, you are confident they are really gone...).

And if you are playing as a horde and you capture a prosperous, fertile or easily-defensible settlement, you have the dilemma of whether it might not be a good moment to settle after all.

Food is now on a per-province basis so no subsidising your hungrier provinces from more productive ones.

Climate change may sound like it’s been shoe-horned in by politically correct developers but is actually a really solid game mechanic since it adds incentive for factions to migrate south to more fertile lands (as well as west, to escape the Huns).

The Huns represent a fascinating dilemma for the player: do you evade or confront them? Indeed the mid-game can feel more like survival horror than strategy if you find yourself isolated against multiple hordes: there's no doomstack like a Hun doomstack...

A raiding horde also 'steals' food from the host province, thus decreasing public order and preventing resident units from replenishing so 'hoping they just go away' is not a foolproof response.

Army integrity feels like it should always have been a feature of Total War games, particularly when combined with attrition when marching in snowy or desert regions (a mechanic missing from, say, Rome 2).

Army traditions were already in R2 but are even more valuable now, because you can spec your army to be, say, resistant to snow attrition.

Customizing your generals/governors (and indeed spies etc) is an interesting challenge but gets a bit tiresome late on when you have numerous agents and armies.

The politics system manages not to be obnoxious for once, not least because here, civil war is not ‘scripted’ (i.e. inevitable at some point). However the key mechanic (of striving for a balance between authoritarianism and lack of control) is somewhat counter-intuitive so perusing a community guide or two is highly recommended. 

I also like the crucial role that female characters play here behind the scenes, rather than appearing on the battlefield as they did in Rome 2. The versatility of influential noblewomen as 'fixers' (providing everything from loyalty boosts for wavering generals to outright assassinations) means that careful attention to the diplomatic marriage market can be even more valuable here than in other TW games. 

Diplomacy seems to work better than average, with factions for the most part seeming to act in their plausible self-interest.

Steam achievements are well integrated and comprehensive although the absence of specific recognition for completing a campaign on 'hard' or 'very hard' feels like a slight to non-legendary players.

The usual several victory conditions strike a good balance between challenge and fairness (at least, in my experience) and I particularly appreciate the absence of arbitrary time limits. Rewards for simply surviving until certain dates feel earned and the optional goals for each 'chapter' provide some ideas about what direction you might want to take with your faction whilst representing no great loss if you choose to ignore them and go your own way.

The tech tree is set out more logically than in R2 and allows the player to 'customize' their faction in a variety of directions e.g. do you go for elite spearmen before swordsmen? Or is sanitation (or eking a bit more food out of the increasingly barren soil) the better priority? Conceivably you could experience two very different playthroughs with the same faction as a result.

Faction variety is excellent, to the extent that playthroughs with, say, the Sassanids, the seafaring Danes or the snow-resistant Slavs provide very different challenges.

Unit variety is also very good and provides a particular incentive to recruiting exotic mercenaries when marching far from home. 

Attila also offers for purchase some of the best DLC expansions in the Total War series, namely 'Age of Charlemagne' and 'The Last Roman'.

Minor annoyances:

Why can’t I look at the initial post-battle screen for as long as I want? 

Why can’t I target an enemy siege tower directly, rather than only being allowed to fire at the enemy unit that is pushing it? Are siege towers protected by some Geneva Convention I don’t know about??

The sheer awkwardness of placing units on certain types of terrain (typically, ‘farmland’-style landscapes, frequently encountered around settlements) suggests that the CA ‘terrain-scaping’ team never actually played any battles themselves.

End turn times are long compared to later games e.g. TWWH. Here, you literally have time to go make a cup of tea.

I also love campaign co-op, I think they should expand upon it in future Total War games and even allow more players, also make it where you can be allies or if you want wage war, not forcing one or the other.

Now for the problems...

I love the factions, but Sega got scummy with selling so many factions in little DLC packs. They're already in the game, you're just paying for the ability to play them.

Sometimes I feel like the lighting looks a little off in the game, maybe that's just me, I don't know.

Unlike Rome II, changing the main city center culture is overly expensive for no reason. In fact I never liked the changing building culture system at all. It makes no sense. They're just dumb founded on expanding buildings because they look different? Very dumb.

Population get's angry way too easily, no matter how much you suck them off sometimes. This would be less of an issue if you could take soldiers away from generals, which leads me to my last issue with this one and all the recent games...

The general system is awful, only being allowed to have so many generals until upgrades, not being able to split your men from their general, all makes no sense and is a bad system. They should go back to Medieval II/Empire.

There is no ability to gift cities, which makes co-op a nightmare.

Im a Total War veteran. I enjoyed the most first Rome, Medieval 2 and Shogun 2. I also played first Medieval and Napoleon, avoided Empire and Rome 2 becouse of terrible AI and annoying mechanics. I thought that Attila will be better, and I was disappointed.

When I first bought the game I thought I will be enjoying a huge, interesting and difficult campaign. That I will be carefully planning my moves and military campaigns thanks to various and detailed maps, that I will be fighting in exciting and huge battles, protect cities, street after street, falling back to inner walls and barricades, that I will burn the cities and raze them to the ground, that I will enjoy great graphics, and overall gameplay. Oh boy, was I wrong.

In the campaign, I didnt have to plan anything. There was no military campaign that seemed hard and challenging enough to waste time on checking the maps and planning moves. The AI will not protect its territories and will do just random, sensless things. Did you want to have a nice historical experience of the campaign? Then you will not find it here, becouse, starting before 400AD, Rome will not hold for next 20 turns and will fall like a century before it historically did, it starts as theoretically biggest military power but thanks to incapable AI, Roman armies are always nowhere to be seen. You will see tribes wich in history did not do much to do a lot, and those that mattered in history to not matter at all in this game. Playing as Saxons I expected nice fights in British scenery with the Celtic tribes but little of that occured. The Celts were bothered with conquering Galia and Hispania, leaving their British territories defenceless, and the Scandinavians, who should also target Britain, did the same thing as the Celts. And this happens always, all the time.  Mainland barbarian tribes are doing nothing.  They do not care about their historical targets and territories they should want. If most of Roman territory is conquered, barbarians will not fight each other for it. When Galia was conquered by the Ebdani and Jutes, Franks, who still had one province, instead of fighting other barbarians for the nearest territory, seemed it fit to just try to invade Roman territories in Spain. Leaving their homeland defenceless, of course. I just steamrolled everything and everyone, even on hardest difficulties, and my skills had nothing to it. You will need no skills. You will just autoresolve most of the battles becouse situations when the chances are equal will be very rare - the AI will not bother to have any strategic advantage over you. And when that rare opportunity to have a big battle occurs there will be yet another disappointment. You will not enjoy any good graphics becouse optimization in this game is a joke. The game is just a slideshow without specific mods improving this matter. And after you get rid of terrbile optimization you will be disappointed once more. The AI will not bother with commanding units in a smoewhat organised and intelligent way. There will be no battle in which the AI will be a threat to you. There will be no interesting sieges too - the AI will just throw all of its units into a single alley and you will easily surround them and cut them down. And the public order system is as annoying as useless. It is almost impossible to keep your people happy, but after some time I realised that there was no point in it. The rebels that spawn when your people are angry have only some units on the first turn and are theoretically supposed to get more over time, but it never happens. The rebel AI, instead of gathering forces, attacks nearest settlement on the first turn, and gets smashed by the garrison.

In overall: The AI is terrible. On the maps I cannot look anymore becouse of bordergore. Battles are easy and disappointing.  Diplomacy is senseless and disappointing. Campaigns are easy, boring, and disappointing. The game is not worth its price. But the modders community is.

67,67888453,english,"TL;DR version - my reccomendation as a empire building turn-based/RTS fan and Total War series fan. + 2x IF's below.

If you have not played a Total War series game before, consider this title suited for more experienced Total War series fans or those that enjoy more challenge. This review will be aimed to give an idea to those that played at least one Total War title before.
If you played Total War series before and you liked the empire building aspect but felt that you could use more challnege - this one is fr you. Especially if you consider 2-3 mods (see below).

Diplomacy - decent, for a Total War series game, but it isn't as good as in Three Kingdoms(the only one I have not played) nor does it have as much options as Napoleon/Empire.

Battle AI - aparat from the joint land/naval battles, where it's pretty clueless, it's decent for Total War game. It managed to beat me few times whlie I was only slightly overpowered. Note I am not a big cheese fan.

Campaign AI - active, far more than in Rome 2, at times I would compare it to Warhammer 2 AI. It frequently punished me for not taking precautions. The two biggest drag's/con's is that a lot of regions become unpopulated quite quick, and they stay like that throught the game and the fact that most of the AI factions do not work to achieve their goals(become an empire), maybe except for the Huns - but I leave them for last.

Faction/government mangement - quite obscure to start with, but ok, when you get a hold of it. The amount of options is about right. All of those available are usable (unlike some of those in Rome 2). Although I find it quite easy to avoid civil wars, unlike in Rome 2. Keeping all your armies loyal is a bit more of a challenge. It presents you with options that in most cases are meaningful gamewise. (eg. provincional edicts based on your state religion)

Empire/province management - this is the area that it almost shines, if you like a challenge. Optimalization of your kigdom is very difficult. You need to think about happines, squalor/sanitation & food. There are contributing factors, like fertility, religion and to extent culture. This game punishes you if you build what you want, where you want yet it doesnot forbid you from doing it. You can assign governnors directly, which gives you direct bonuses to a particular province and unlocks edicts there (improvement over Rome 2 and Warhammer 2 - empire faction). You can even see a governor in the battle if the province capital would be assaulted.

Other points:
- hun invasion. So it's done in quite a harsh way, where even Attilla respawns once. It's wery annoying to deal with and seems very unclear on how to deal with it. It is reminiscent of Chaos invasion in Warhammer 1 & 2, but more annoying if you are in the wrong place on the map.
-Climate change is implemented (increases the challenge).
-Every year has 4 seasons, that impact the gameplay (eg. snow attrittion) and give you time to know your characters. This decreases the role of children though.
-I suggest considering the following mods(even before first playthrough): 
--Hun Invasion related, to tune it to a level that you would like (requires a bit of reading or possibly a youtube video).
--AI resettling related - so that the unpopulate areas (be it due to hun invasion or other actions) will be a t least partially populated by the AI over time
--Fertility related mod, that gives small buff to the region fertility through sanitation buildings. It does not really decrease the challenge but increases the player options(replan the economy or invest more in sanitation).
--Few bugs remain, so consider community patch/fix bundle.

Hope this will help some of you guys, considering if you should buy this.",1587665218,1587665218,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198041753719,127,3,4586,0,4386,1600165700,,

94,67580401,english,"One helluva time!   Playing the brilliant Medieval 1212 mod now - what an amazing piece of work!  But want to give a shout out to another absolutely amazing mod.

Love playing as The Huns - in the Attila vs Flavius Aetius Mod.  Of my 2,000 hours - 1,500 have been in that mod by Papeion.  I've now won it as the Huns 5 times.  It makes playing them much, much harder and more interesting. 

It's played on the Charlemagne Map, and you only have one province in Pannonia - and because there is no horde mechanic you have to be careful in what you produce and where. 
 
It starts with an epic battle Catalunian Fields - 451 AD and you're whole army is what survives that.  And it has hard coded when Attila will die all too soon - and other battles you have to survive like a massive Gepid rebellion - after he dies.

My favorite parts are that you can't lose a single battle or you lose the 'myth of invincibility' and have much worse relations with all factions and that you have to convert every single town/city you decide to keep into a Hunnic settlement - at a large cost of money and time.  It makes you be very selective about where you actually stay. 

I've now beaten it on 'easy' 'normal' and 'hard' settings, and it's truly been a blast each time.  It also really taught me about the importance of religion in determining happiness - and how to play horse archers - as you end up having to personally play most of the closer battles due to fair, but not always advantegeous auto-resolve calculations.

But overall it is brilliantly detailed and balanced.  If you haven't tried it out - please do!
The selfless work of modders is what truly makes these games shine.

64,38622573,english,"Live one of the darkest times in Europe. Barbarians are coming from the North! Barbarians are coming from the East! Eastern Empires rise from the ashes. Celts want to reclaim their father's lands, Germans want to revenge Roman Empire and completly destroy her, Nords want new lands and riches, nomadic tribes from the east with the most terrible between them the bloody Huns want to conquer Roman Empire and take her lands and riches, the sassanid Empire and her allies want to make a new Persian Empire and take back what belong to them because the desert never forget. Can Roman Empire from the west and east hold these invaders or this will be a bloody end for the greatest Empire of the world ? You choose, you write history, it is in your hand but all we know what really happened so don't fool each other. 

So, great total war game with many common things with Rome 2 but different too.

 - Nice graphics. 
 - Good politc system( intrigues and corruption, political offices and governors), better diplomancy( puppet and tribute states, giving regions to hordes, proper marriages and more), there is family system( adoptions, illegitimates and true successors but also Rebel generals and usurpers of the throne) and ofcourse historical units.
 - Epic campaigns with epic and huge battles with citizens in the sieges and More bloody animations.
 - Except from culture differences there is and religion and factions have unique traits.
 - True sanitation and food system but much difficult without mods if you want full upgrade 
    your cities.
 -  Historical units and  buildings.
 -  Nice events.
 -  Realistic diseases and attritions.
 -  Many historical battles.
 -  Much more. 

Don't forget to buy all DLC for better experience.

84,66765394,english,"Total War: Rome 3, or at least that's what is should be called.

Other factions are cool, for a while. 

Hordes and migrating factions have cool mechanics and start off super fun but get old after a bit. You don't empire build as a horde, you just raze settlements and extract resources from factions until they eventually turn on you and you have to burn them down anyway. Migratory factions play the same as a horde except they have to inevitably settle down, meaning every turn you stay migrating is another turn you'll lose out on empire building for the hell that comes mid-late game.

The other settled factions vary. The Sassanid Persians are very strong and very isolated, making them by far the easiest faction, but they have enough diversity to make them interesting until you get too powerful to have any reprecautions for your actions and lose interest. The Celts/Norse/Germanic factions are all basically the same, with very minor differences in unit rosters, buildings, technologies, and locations/allies/enemies. The tend to be absolutely screwed mid-late game as the harsher climate starves them to the point they either cant afford to feed their armies or pay for the higher tier units. The Slavs are doomed from the start.

 Some of the desert factions are cool though. The Garamantians can start carving up Rome from get-go while the empire is distracted elsewhere. Himyar is the most unique faction in the game, with a unique religion, diverse and powerful units, buildings, and starting location. The Tanukhids are basically a migratory faction like the Germanic ones, except they have eastern units, bonuses, different horde mechanics, and can pick better locations to settle. Lakhmids and Axum are ""meh"", but still more interesting than the europeans.

This all might sound a bit negative, but none of what I said above matters. The heart of this game is about the Fall of Rome. One of the most important events in the history of the world is at stake, and the game wants you to feel it. Rome is divided, there's the rich East which would later survive for over 1000 years and become the ""Byzantine Empire"", and then there's the imploding West, perhaps the single most influential state that has ever existed, and its fucked in every embarrassing way you could imagine.

This game is meant to be played as the Western Roman Empire, saving it from impending destruction and rising above every problem thrown at you. 
*Every germanic, celtic, nordic, african, gothic, and nomad faction around you declares war on you one after another
*The Huns are traveling across the world explicitly to burn your civilization to the ground while its weak
*Public order is gone, and 30 or so provinces are on the verge of revolting from the first few turns.
*Nothing is prosperous anymore save a few areas in Italy
*Some are starving and wont even be able to feed your troops
*Religious differences tear you apart
*You have a pathetically small army compared to your neighbors with much less quality
*Corruption is robbing you of your taxes
*Plague and disease will break out unless you dump tons of money into sanitation
*Your Emperor is the most pathetic leader around. 

Turning this around and painting the map with a prosperous and powerful Roman Eagle is literally the most rewarding gameplay experience I've had quite possibly ever. Kudos to CA for making a game so polarizingly difficult and stressful that it ACTUALLY gives it turbulent historical setting some real justice. This game is not easy, its not relaxing, but it can be incredibly rewarding and immersive, so it gets a big thumbs up.",1586195086,1586195086,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198088013436,104,1,46950,0,45186,1598942261,,

So I pressed ''Start Campaign'' 
At first sight it was beautiful, seeing all those settlements beloging to me, and surrounded by pitiful barbarian tribes who had no idea of what culture is. I felt powerful anjd told myself it would take a few turns and I'd have the entire continent.


I was wrong.


THIS GAME IS LEGIT THE EQUIVALENT OF DARK SOULS BUT IN AN RTS STRATEGY GAME STYLE AND IT JUST WANTS YOU TO DIE
PLAYING AS THE STRONGEST EMPIRE EVER? HAHA NO
JUST BUILT THIS ECONOMY? HAHA LEMME RAID
WON A HARD BATTLE WITH SOME OF UR MOST EXPENSIVE TROOPS? WATCH ME AMBUSH THEM


So you want to die? Then go ahead. 

Any other faction than the Roman Empire is useless though. They don't really exist.

24,66045583,english,"I've played around 160 hours of Attila so far. I understand that's not much by some standards, but I still think it's about time for me to write a review of this game.

This review will be very long. For those of you who prefer shorter reviews, you might want to find a different one.

Total War: Rome 2, contrary to popular opinion, added some very good ideas to the series. For example, it introduced a set of factors which you had to balance within your settlements (food, income, and public order). This meant you had to manage your settlements to a greater degree, which had two main effects:

1. It meant you had to ensure your owned settlements are stable before having your armies leave them to conquer other lands.

2. It added a city management aspect to the game.

Rome 2 also fleshed out agents, giving them their own stats and more options when upgrading them. Rome 2 introduced army traditions, giving your armies more meaning and a greater sense of history.

Why am I bringing up Rome 2 in an Attila review? Because Attila took all those ideas, and refined them. See, Rome 2's ideas were very good, but were often awkwardly executed. Attila was a fresh chance to take the community's criticism and put it into action.

There are a few Total War games I have not played. Namely, the original Shogun and Medieval and the games from Warhammer on. But even still, I consider Total War: Attila to be one of the greatest Total War titles ever (yes, right up there with the original Rome: Total War and Shogun 2: Fall of the Samurai). There are several reasons for this:

1. As mentioned before, Attila took the good but poorly executed ideas of Rome 2 and enacted them as they should have been.

2. There are a wide diversity of cultures to play, each with their own advantages and disadvantages in terms of both soldiers and buildings.

3. Attila introduced the horde system, adding a completely new style of play.

4. Related to 2, the differences between factions are deeply meaningful, especially in terms of units. This is something that cannot be said, for example, about Shogun 2.

5. The game is fairly well-balanced, and the AI is a little better than most other Total War games.

That said, there are several weaknesses to this game:

1. While the AI is significantly better than in previous games, it still isn't the best. The Total War series is not known for its stellar AI.

2, While the game is pretty well-balanced, there are still some over-powered and under-powered units. Huscarls, for example, are pretty hard to counter, while elephants, while useful under the right circumstances, are a lot easier to counter than in previous games.

3. Related to 1, the AI seems to decide whether or not to make peace with you based on how much they dislike you. This means that if you raze even 1 city, they will practically never make peace with you, meaning you have to actually HUNT DOWN EVERY SINGLE SETTLEMENT AND ARMY THEY OWN in order to 'make peace' with them.

4. The Huns are very difficult to play. You should be able to play the faction the game is named after without a whole lot of difficulty.

5. Again related to 1, increasing the difficulty basically gives the AI a whole list of cheats. I understand that it is difficult to craft an AI without doing so, but let me illustrate with an example:

With about 6 settlements, you should be able to field 2 to 3 full armies. On hard, an AI faction with only one settlement will be able to raise just as many armies as you, often even more. This is because the AI gets huge discounts to unit upkeep as the difficulty increases. This makes starting out very hard, and factions difficult to fight at almost any level of development.

If you're ok with that, then that's fine, but I and I assume other players are not.

6, Also like its predecessor Rome 2 the game is split up into several DLCs. You can't play the Nordic factions, the desert factions, or the Slavic factions without paying $27 in DLCs. This is a bad practice that EA is unfortunately in the habit of. 

So should you get this game? Yes. I would wait for a sale, but it is more than worth it even at full price. This is, in my honest opinion, one of the greatest Total War games of all time. If you are a total beginner to the Total War series, I would consider buying the original Rome 1 instead, so that you can see if Total War interests you and so that you can start off with a simpler game in the series. But this game still can appeal to all Total War players of all skill levels and experiences.

I recommend this game as a real challenge for Total War fans, especially playing as either East or West Rome.

The chances of snowballing like in Rome II are slim. This game does have its problems, Atilla and his death stacks can be a real pain, but also the Roman civ tech tree, as it kills your ability to build useful concrete structures in favor of a big church and palace.

68,65581811,english,"I love the Total War series. In fact, Napoleon and Empire are probably my favorite strategy games ever developed. And after 40 hours of Attila, I can definitively say that this is the worst game in the series. I think this is mainly due to the fact that they changed many of the games characteristics to fit more authentically within the time period. The problem with that is that during this time in history life was incredibly difficult and things took a long time to do.

Total War as a series is already strenuous concerning how long it takes to accomplish conquest. This game takes that concept and ramps it up tenfold. This may be what some Total War fans enjoy about the series but as for me it feels like I am moving along much to slow even while playing strategically correct. That is unless of course you play as a like the Huns, in which your not conquering land but rather raiding or just down right destroying it. And this is where the main flaw lies with Attila. The purpose of a strategy game, to myself, has always been to creatively think your way out of a problem. In this game you feel like you are being forced to play a certain way to make any progress at a reasonable rate. I mean what the hell! I wanna conquer land when I play these games! Is that too much to ask for?

There are other reasons why this game is flawed and I why I am giving this a down-vote, however that is the main one. Don't waste your money on this title. There are better Total War games out there.

You missed random war declarations from Medieval 2? You are lucky, because it's back in Attila TW... You defeated you opponent, razed all his cities and left him just with one unit of general. No problem they will gladdly fight you for another 150 turns till you make them disappear.
-Strategy Map: All generals have same range of movement, so 90% of time you will be chasing enemy army, that will raid you cities in front of you and then run away withou chance of catching them... Then you realize that there are other 3 armies on other side of your realm.
-Battle: have you ever tried to shoot the bow? Great if yes your are better that all archers in Attila TW, If they don't miss, they hit your own with poision arrow. Just on f**** poison arrow and you own units starts to die. Those f***** arches killed more own people than enemy. 
-Music: After hour of listening of throat singing you'll turn music off before your head explodes. It's much worse than in Rome 2...

Why is there so much overpriced garbage DLC? And so on and so on...

20,62385405,english,"Almost 5 years have passed since its release, and I have been playing this game ever since. There are  few historical games available with as many details about the early middle ages as Attila Total War. As your adventure starts in 395 AD with the Western Roman Empire on the verge of collapse, you will have a chance to either make a final stand for the Western half of the Roman Empire or deal it a lethal blow as you side with one of the many barbarian nations. 

From the perspective of a passionate historian, I can only vouch for the tremendous amount of research that must have gone into developing this game. You will find a comprehensive section on units and buildings in the encyclopaedia, which you can consult at any time during the campaigns and battles. Educationally, this is a great opportunity for gamers to learn about the onset of the middle ages while having fun in the process. 

Gameplay-wise, this ninth instalment to the Total War franchise retains the turn-based features of its predecessors with the addition of a few extra perks, namely food and fertility levels. From a historical standpoint, introducing these two concepts makes perfect sense as one of the driving factors leading Germanic and Hunnic tribes southbound was the hope of finding fertile lands. What this means in terms of the game is substantial difference between factions and their mobility. Unlike Western and Eastern Romans, horde factions like the Ostrogoths or the Huns can turn themselves into a settlement as they please. Conversely, these barbarian factions can switch back to hordes when they don't control any settlements (save for the Huns who can't take or occupy any settlement). In this respect, the game is clearly biased towards the barbarian and horde factions as controlling them will allow you to scout out southern lands while raiding and pillaging and settling the areas with the highest wealth and fertility to build your own state. 

Fertility levels are connected to the amount of food you'll be getting in your provinces each turn. Accordingly, food is everything in this game and you will really need to watch out for food levels or else you will find yourself on the brink of bankruptcy in no time. However,  some factions, such as the two halves of the Roman Empire, are almost ever able to produce sufficient amounts of food without losing much at every turn. Running out of food will cause your armies to suffer attrition and will prevent them from replenishing in all provinces, causing also substantial decreases in public order levels. 

Another cook perk is settlement burning. Not only can you now burn your enemies' settlements to the ground, but you can level your own settlement if need arises. This is something you may want to do if you wish to oust your enemies from a province or deny them lands. When you do that, you will destroy all the buildings in the process, forcing your enemy to invest a great deal of time and money resettling the area later on. 

Finally, there are plenty of DLCs which will no doubt enhance your gaming experience significantly. Moreover, if you consider that the latest addition to Rome II Total War was released a mere two years ago and that Rome II Total War was released a year before Attila, you might just expect newer DLCs even in 2020 - though nothing has been confirmed as of yet. 

The only downside to this game I can think of is the actual combat as little, if anything at all, seems to have changed since Rome II, making this game look a carbon copy of Rome II from time to time. I would have appreciated new tactics, or even better ways to control army units and possibly some mini-games. Other than that, just do yourself a big favour and get this game. You definitely won't be disappointed.",1579962424,1582489114,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198095540791,12,2,12438,0,5452,1598532568,,

31,63876691,english,"Great game! (However...) The Campaign for the most part won't be to exactly to everyone's taste - let me explain:

The campaign, just like the majority of the Total War game's is great. Build army's, fight battle's, Conquer territory rinse and repeat, you know how it goes with a Total War game. However, when you lose a settlement in Attila especially to any of the factions that adopt the nomadic horde type mechanic (i.e the Huns and the bleeding majority of factions in this game) there is a high possibility they will raze your settlement to the ground. This destroys the settlement (a sort of nuke simulation legitimately happens lol), takes it out of your control and if you want it back you have to pay a large lump sum of money (relative to the settlement size! For a city like Rome the fee can be astronomical and practically rights the city out of the game) to rebuild it all over again. Now, I can here you saying ""get gud M8"" but when you spend a few hours, a few days, hell even a few months on a campaign and out of no where Attila and his band of merry lads appear out of no where (and yes that is an actual mechanic, they just suddenly appear all of the god damn map at random!) and destroy one of your main settlements the game can leave you feeling infuriated due to the game feeling unfair; a game being a challenge, great, a game feeling unfair and unpredictable, annoying. 

Now although, this is entirely the premise of the game, Attila along with other tribes did this in real life, the game annoys the hell out of me.

25,62382118,english,"Total War series ended at Medieval 2 Total War... So simple. 
Instead of enriching the previous gameplay they chose to put effort only to graphics and dismantle the rest.

1. Disgusting city building system: From where did it come to the mind of the project manager to have only specific building being built in a city. How is it possible to improve a province's sanitation by building a bathhouse in another city one month distance away!!! There is no possibility for the player to form a proper line of defence with major fortifications in the border line. In Medieval Total War 2 you could choose to make a defensive line of castles and hold a position while you fight conquest war on the other side. This option is nowhere in this game. You can build up to 4 or 6 structures in a city...why????
2. Historically inacurate: major imperial cities turned into villages ready to by sacked. No walls. No gates. Some decorative pallisade walls and some stupid towers throwing 10 missing arrows before being destroyed and two units of 300 men at all in your position... I consider if the limitanei guards needed a general to be to specific territories... wonder... 
Romans did not build walls like these that you project. Roman walls were like these in Constantinople. Not a leveled ground keeping the mud with the wall...
Constantinople is a good effort. Very good. Though no double wall...But also the previous Total Wars didn't have it. 
3.  Sieges are the most stupid part of the game. Even in some major cities that remained as they were supposed to be, walls are simple fences. They climb them in no time and then you have a battle like any other. Archers doesn't even manage to throw two shots of arrows before enemies have already climbed the walls. Towers are also in major cities a joke. 
4. Economy: This is a strong part of the game. Very intelligent system of economy with products playing major role for the economic wellfare, surplus of bread spreaded throughout the state. Very good effort. 
5. Politics: Very good improvent. You have someting to say to what is happening. More freedom for the player. 
Overall I was fan of Total War. I don't know anymore - as I see that the same concept goes on. I do not recommend it.

Pros
- Suprisingly good performance, compared to what most people say, on a mid end pc am able to run 25k soldiers with relatively good fps. This is twice what im able to run on games such as medieval 2.
- Great selection of mods - Rise of Mordor, 1212 ad, 7 kingdoms,nothern kingdoms , Ancient Empires and more, absolutely the best modding community out there.
-Incredible graphics, especially when compared to it's predecessor Rome 2.
-Decently Active Player base
-Intuitive and in depth campaign design
-All issues you find in game, once again can be fixed by smaller mods
-On sale quite alot
-Good dlc, Age of Charlegmagne is the best dlc CA released in my opinion.

Cons
- Bad lighting, can be fixed through graphics mods though
- Not as popular as the newer titles
- Campaign can be difficult at times for newer players
- Initial time period is not that appealing


No comparison, best TW game released when modded, please if you have not bought this game, give it a damn try, I still am not bored 1665 hours in.

3 Public problems ...in this game are really harsh public happines decreeses ... it took lot of time when you stabileze whole province ... and it will take more time when you play on legendary ... this game really try you irritate you and force you to really care about every single province even when you got it fully build ...so if you play in co op.. dont take the time limiton for a plaayer during round ...

61,62159871,english,"Total War: ATTILA is incredibly unoptimized and feels odd when playing. Truthfully, as much as I wanted to like this game, I would say that Medieval Total War outclasses this poor game. Total War: ATILLA is overall uninteresting for its price, leading you to purchase other games in the Total War series instead. Like knights? Get medieval. Like this type of combat? Get Rome. Like ranged weaponry? Get Empire and Napoleon. There are other games that work much better than this one for the same price or cheaper. The maps themselves are nice to gaze at, however there are too many bugs in the game and 'features' that make the combat feel unfair and boring. Buildings can be easily burnt down however there is no technical advantage to this since you can't walk across the burnt rubbage. The sea battles are like any other Total War Game - uninteresting and stale. AI consistently forms a large 1-2 rank line with their regiments and charge all at once. (Not to mention AI always knows where you are, and if not, they stay still for ages forcing you to march to them). The maps are 'huge' however feel a bit empty since nearly no combat occurs in the outer regions, making there no need to include it in trade for worse performance. As I said, the game is poorly optimized. I get a low framerate with a 2070 graphics card despite my computer pushing hard and rocking medium framerates in other Total War games at high-ultra settings. As for gameplay itself, the game runs decently. Diplomacy is mediocre and advancing through the campaign is nothing special. Personally, I prefer campaign movement in the Total War Empire and Napoleonic games over what is present in the newer TW games.

It’s a marketing attribution tool that helps companies determine which of their adverts are most effective. It does this in a similar way to other analytics tools by using cookies to generate a unique token from device information, and comparing that with data taken from marketing campaigns and game activations. In this way, the companies that use it are able to see which adverts are more effective. You can find out more about Red Shell here: https://redshell.io/home

However, while Red Shell was only used to measure the effectiveness of our advertising, we saw that players were clearly concerned about it and that it would be difficult for us to entirely reassure everyone. As such, the implementation of Red Shell was removed from all Total War games that previously used it.

66,60666341,english,"Much more fun than the original campaign (OC). I played as Belisarius and decided to be loyal to the emperor (you can choose to go a separatist route, which I suspect adds a lot more difficulty).

Pros:
- It has something like a plot. OC is sort of ""make your own story"" and it can be quite uninspiring, also the Huns and infertility mechanic there worked terribly. Here you have a real task, you're recreating history and your wife and boss give you missions with some interesting/funny background.
- The endgame feels achievable (and it is), the map is less chaotic than in OC
- The super-dull faction management is much easier to work with since you have much fewer characters - it even makes sense and you will use it to gain advantage
- Campaign AI can be cheeky sometimes, although you'll still easily outsmart it in battles
- Battles are fun - Eastern Romans have good and varied units
- Replayability is still here, I guess the other factions offer a very different approach
- 12 turns per year, finally
- Map is great - zoomed into North Africa and Italy/Gaul/Hispania, with more detailed provinces than in OC. There's 105 regions.
- Just one more turn and I'll go to bed...

Cons:
- My allies (e.g. Byzantium) were quite dumb. The victory conditions don't care, but you might have to return to quell uprisings against the cities you reclaimed, cause Emperor has 10 legions, but couldn't care less that thrice eradicated Ostrogoths are estabilishing themselves in Italy yet again.
- I reclaimed EVERYTHING and destroyed all the other factions, yet it's not a ""triumph"" cause that requires me to control 240 units and have income of 20k. Which means I'd have to sit and grind new buildings and armies for a week for the game to acknowledge my success

Total War: ATILLA will kick your arse, and will spit on your spasming corpse for fun.  


Set in a period of time wracked by instability, migrations, collapse and environmental catastrophe, Total War: ATILLA is not about building an empire and flourishing. You heard me right - this isn't about building a mighty empire. The aim of the game is survival.  

The entire game has this gut wrenching feeling of treading water - your calamitous, messy collapse could possibly only be one famine or barbarian migration away. There’s no telling when a province’s food supply might fail, or when a tidal wave of Gothic migrations might wash away the civilisation you worked so hard to grow. Time is constantly in short supply as you race to patch holes in your sinking ship: as you plug one, two more emerge. Sure, you’ve crushed that major rebellion, but the harvest in one of your provinces has spectacularly failed, and the Huns have ravaged an outlying region on your frontier. The fleeing refugees are pouring into your towns and cities, fuelling the fires of discontent – it may only be a short while before yet more people raise their torches to topple your rule.  

In terms of time period, this era is an extremely interesting and (in my opinion) underrated choice. You have the big players of the Western and Eastern Roman Empires, as well as the rising power of the Huns and Attila, and the opulent Sassanid Empire in the east. Despite this, however, many of the great powers are in fact one punch away from completely imploding. While the Western Roman Empire stands as the prestigious bulwark against barbarian tribes, it is only a matter of time before it completely collapses – drowned in a torrent of rebellions, invasions, famines and plagues. You get the most fantastic contrast between the settled, civilised peoples of the world and the nomadic, ruthless, primal tribes in the east. Seeing Legionaries face off against Hunnic tribesmen, knowing that civilisation itself is at stake if they should fail, adds an unexpected layer of emotional engagement and anxiety to every battle – great or small. Certainly, this is one of my favourites eras in history, so perhaps I am biased towards this game as a result. Regardless of this, I believe many people can easily appreciate the themes which run so strongly in this game. 

I would like to share a story with you, because I was really impressed at how dramatic and emotional the fights can be in this game. I think it’s a testament to how well CA achieved the look and feel of the time period: 

In one battle I distinctly remember, I was playing as Western Rome defending Britain. The Saxons had unleashed a full-scale invasion, and my small local garrison was charged with a desperate defence of the region bearing the brunt of the enemy force. Reinforcements were nowhere in sight - in lieu of migrations across the Rhine and Alps, troops had been drawn elsewhere to halt the advance of barbarians into the Roman heartlands. In the foggy morning light, Saxon long ships were spotted approaching the shoreline. The fate of The Isles would be decided by this desperate bloody struggle.  
Come the afternoon, the field was littered with Roman corpses. Thereafter, control of Britain rapidly receded and ultimately dissolved under the weight of repeated Germanic invasions. I damn near saluted those dead Romans – the whole fight gave me a sad sinking feeling in my gut, the feeling that civilisation’s light was to be smothered in this part of the world for an unknown span of time. 
Truly, the lights had gone out.   

I understand why, to some people, this may sound positively awful. Some may wish to establish a flourishing kingdom, while others might wish to conquer all the lands they possibly can. Despite this, however, playing as an ailing kingdom or empire, barely able to keep it together, has a certain unique charm. It's strange to play a strategy game where your campaigns feel so hopeless – where borders are merely permeable barriers which will someday burst under the pressure of moving tribes. I haven’t played many strategy games where your military campaigns aren’t so much glorious conquest, but desperate attempts to retain control of regions of the map. Its brutal and depressing, and it perfectly captures the artistic and visual feel of the time period. This world is ageing, failing – soon, the empires of old will shatter and fall to a new wave of contenders. In Rome, the Goths will soon gain footholds in Italy and Spain, with the Franks wresting control of the region roughly equating to France. In terms of atmosphere, I believe Total War: ATILLA very effectively captures this feeling of decay and collapse.  

There are many issues with the game, as many others have pointed out. I despise the DLC policy that CA have taken with this game, and sometimes the game feels a little too brutal. Regardless, I can still wholeheartedly recommend it – despite its flaws, it is a great game. As an added benefit, the mods for this game are awesome, and many are still being uploaded/worked on to this day.  

This certainly isn’t for everyone, and is a rather unexpected departure from the regular formula of a Total War game (in my opinion). It may not be to everyone’s liking; however, if you enjoy a real challenge – and I mean a REAL challenge, or if you enjoy a constant struggle, and unforgiving difficulty, then this game might be worth your time.  

And who knows - you may be the one to save Rome.",1577402176,1577402636,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198079458296,188,3,3089,0,3089,1509831138,,

Pros:
+Coastal Battles
+Combined Land and Naval Sieges (port assault)
+a variety of factions and units
+huge single player map

Cons
-melee engagements between individual soldiers (absolutely horrible)
-poor AI programming (relatively good at land battles, but very poor at attacking and defending settlements)
-a vast variety of siege games bugs (units do not know what to do if you order them to use the stairs of the wall, units won't assemble in the right way to shoot from the walls, especially if there is a curve on the wall etc)
-not many maps (i find myself playing on the same castles over and over again. Even if there are many land battle maps, I do not get to use them at all. In fact, 90% of battles commence in sieges.)
-towers in sieges (It doesn't really matter who owns the towers. In most cases, they will kill an equal number of soldiers from both sides. Their targeting is absolutely crap. You cannot control which unit the towers engage at all. They just shoot whatever is closest to them. In some battles, they kill hundreds of my soldiers even when positioned well, which is absolutely unrealistic and frustrating.) This could be solved, adding one simple button: On and Off. Additionally, if they decide to include a way to control which enemy unit they should engage, it would drastically improve the tower's usefulness.
-poor graphics for the time being (basically copy and paste from previous titles) If they don't want to change the graphics, lower the damn price. 

Overall, I liked the game. But that is just because I skipped Rome 2 even though I own it. If I had played Rome 2 and then purchased Attila, I would be absolutely mad. Attila is more like a mod for the previous title.

- Several diverse cultures
- Roman Empires are very unique factions for a TW game
- Managing sanitation, food, population, and more for EACH city is a new challenge
- Climate change is a bitch
- Mediterranean always a good map
- Reasonable victory end dates
- Naval combat may not be deep but it's fun, especially on same map with ground troops
- Internal politics to manage

But then the AI introduces you to the first crack in the seams. AI factions largely play the same, no matter their personality. They're obsessed with raiding/sacking and don't care about expansion. Within 25 turns, you'll be a top 5 power with anyone because you're actually building infrastructure. So every threat feels the same, which means you really don't need to diversify your strategies to win.

Then I realized how easy it is to manage sanitation, food, etc. They don't present extra strategic choices - it's just more busy work to make sure the numbers line up. The internal politics present no real challenge - it's very easy by midgame to maintain between 40-60% power. And some of the coolest units (like Sassanids elephants) aren't even that useful. So it's hard to recommend when a game like Three Kingdoms exists unless you just need something around this era (and I do think Attila is better than Rome 2).

I just wrapped my old VH Sassanids campaign (yes, they're very easy, I know) and went back to an old Legendary Picts campaign. By turn 40 it already feels like I'm in the mop-up stage of a late-game empire builder. The only ""survival"" aspect to this game is the climate change - which is admittedly cool.

Many other total war games have nations starting out from single or a couple of settlements. The idea of playing as Rome (East or West) is fun and challenging - providing a unique experience that sets it apart from other total war games. The fear of hordes and expectation of the attack of the Huns constantly presents a fear that requires a large amount of focus and it quite exciting. 
However, i am utterly lost and confused when it comes to buildings - I cannot seem to balance public order. I have some provinces with positive food, almost 100% religion and high sanitation yet public order still declines. This i do not really understand - it makes playing the campaign incredibly difficult, more than necessary in my view. I find it really hard to extend my borders because rebels just appear constantly. It was so bad that i jut razed half the empire (West) and retreated all the way back to the Alps and Italy - and I've been pushing back out since. This has taken roughly 40 hours of game play though. The buildings are what I struggle most with, I just get so confused and cannot remember what to build and I end up building the wrong thing because there are too many options I think. Towers are just stupid - they wipe out my horses in like a minute, and the fact that you cannot capture them, they must be destroyed, is silly.

The battles improved a little bit but are still very TW. The campaign on the other hand was too much of a change for me in the first couple of hours of game-play. A lot more aspects like complicated character and family-tree management where overwhelming. Also the provinces with three settlements each confused me. Now I have played lots of hours and have to say: I love it. If you are willing to take time to find your way through Attila, it will give you a lot of pleasure.

Anyway it's now running smooth and it's a great looking game it has a darker grittier tone in comparison to Rome 2s bright colourful artstyle there are lots of different factions to choose from and plenty of cool unique looking units including early vikings various catafracts and clibinari celts barbarians beserkers elephants ect. It can be very hard though but it should be remembered this is mostly an empire survival game and there are plenty of guides on youtube and such.

Find the line ""gfx_video_memory 0;"" and change it to ""gfx_video_memory -2000;""

55,58165335,english,"And so we begin. Four years after buying this game, I feel like its time to give it a proper and insightful review. 
Total War: Attila. This is by far the hardest game in the whole entire franchise. One that we love and hate at times, but has steadily provided us with fun games to play.
So, what's different about Attila? What makes this game so complicated? First and foremost let's talk history. This game is set at the dawn of the Dark Ages. The Roman Empires are falling apart and the smaller but numerous tribes are picking apart at it's carcass. Whether you choose to take the challenge of leading a falling Empire or partake in it's downfall, you're going to have many enemies along the way. Playing as the Western Roman Empire is one of the most annoying, fun, boring, challenging and repetitive experiences. The adjectives used seem almost paradoxal, but its for a reason. You're going to repeat the same battles over and over again, you're going to lose almost all of your starting territories due to the fact that almost every existing faction will declare war on you, but once you finally manage to balance the Public Order and the Squalor, you're finally going to start having fun. Destroying the once smaller, but now slightly bigger tribes isn't going to necessarily be an easy task, but with patience you'll get there. And then, try this again but in Legendary difficulty. I'm sure you'll have tons of fun (you won't, trust me)!
It also has one of the best DLCs for the whole franchise, ""Age Of Charlemagne"" which is set in the early medieval periods.
Total War: Attila is a great and fun game to play, and if you're a fan of the franchise but still haven't acquired this game, I'd very much recommend you to do so.",1574858361,1574858460,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,76561198165626936,204,19,12917,0,12915,1577970246,,

60,57995360,english,"I could post a massive review slating several aspects of this game (lackluster DLC, battle bugs, lack of variety etc) but you'll see that from other reviews here and I'll only be repeating what they've said. What ruins this game for me is the public order system; it's rancid, and I'm sick and tired of it. When a rebellion happens, the rebel army spawns next to a random settlement within your province, meaning you have to take a wild guess as to where it's going to spawn so you can move your army there. As the rebel army gets to act on the first turn it spawns, unless you have an army garrisoning the settlement it's next to, it'll take the settlement, loot it and reduce public order further, meaning there'll be another rebellion when you take the settlement back.

If this isn't the case, I'm either:
1. Sitting in provinces trying to prevent a rebellion when public order is -97 (-2 per turn) due to factors such as immigrants that the player can't do anything to prevent, or;
2. Chasing that one enemy army that's sacking your settlements and standing 1 movement point out of reach from your army, because the AI knows where your armies are at all times.
If you do play the long game and wait for instability and immigrants to go down so that your provinces can be SOMEWHAT stable (meaning they won't instantly rebel the moment you move your army) the AI will just get stronger and consolidate.
This is all without mentioning the countless bugs that are all over this thing. I've tried really hard to get into Attila, but I just can't; the gameplay is just tedious, frustrating and dull in comparison to other total war games. As a massive history buff, Warhammer II is better.",1574807857,1574807857,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198042321793,185,4,16826,0,9794,1582489330,,
61,32686057,english,"[h1] Total War: Rome II and Total War: Attila, These two total war titles are my current favorites. I have no hope for any new total war game I can expect to be as good as these two currently are. [/h1]

[b] This is not a kingdom or empire building and managing game unlike the other total war turn-based strategy games. This is a historical survival strategy game based on ''The Migration Period''. The game will rush over you once it gets the chance.  The game wants you to fail and die in pain. The hardest Total War game so far if you ask me.  [/b]

AI in this game is cheating. I mean it, It really cheats. For example, a neighboring faction in just one small town (which is one of the settlements in your province you're located in ) might end up having two complete stacks of army in third turn and you don't even have one with twenty and you must conquer them because in long term you will neither be able to secure public order in your province nor will be able to afford the units you need, to expand on the map. Long story short, The AI in this game is really capable of doing some impossible things any normal player, or even some total war experts can't do normally. This is the exact definition of the word ''cheating'' in my vocabulary. yeah AI in this game is really cheating in this level of absurdity.

The Huns, I want to mention them a little bit. They are the most cheating faction in this game I can assure you all as you take it from the title of the game that they are pain on your shoulders. It's hard to stop them and even harder to make them extinct. They spawn hordes in every corner of the map and raid into Europe. The worst thing about them is that once they attack one of your settlement, not only do they sack the settlement but also they raze the settlement so you won't be able to colonise there until mid or late game. They also cause fertility damage in your province where the settlement they razed is located. If you are familiar with Warhammer Total War, You might think that they are similar in attitude to the chaos faction in warhammer, yes they are. They will be the same throughout the campaign until you or one of the some other factions in the game kill Attila the Hun. but be aware that you can't kill him just in one battle, you have to kill him tree or four times. you can't get away from them. 

If Western Roman Empire in this game drew some attention from you, if you ask me, Don't jump into it yet unless you certainly know what you're doing. Maybe after hundreds of hours of playing this game, you might be good to go for it. It is really, terribly terrible, the whole world around you will declare war on you at the beginning of the campaign you just started as WRE. 

Despite the fact that CA abandoned the game long time ago, There is something better which keeps the game fresh and makes it more playable for hundreds of hours more. Of course, MODS. You will have access to the Total War: ATTILA workshop if you're willing to buy the game and give it a shot. 


This is my point of view in general, so you'd better be ready to run into an AI which might be acting off time to time as in every other total war games. Even if you can take advantage of these stupid actions of the AI in battles, It feels like, you're playing againts a bunch of stupid mad men.",1498232158,1574798424,True,1,0,0.512499988079071045,2,True,False,False,76561198329219935,99,4,45684,0,40927,1599569711,,

6,57555692,english,"In all the time I have played Attila, I would not recommend it. The reasons are as followed:

1. Bugs, examples being when you order your troops to run down fleeing enemies, but instead decide to stand still, requiring you to endless give the order in some hope they will kill the enemy. Also boats have a habit of becoming one with the land and archers can just instantly volley the moment they turn around from running.

2. The game is often quite tedious, with the AI knowing where your armies are at all times and just showing up where you are not, making it quite a dull experience of running after a single army to stop it from sacking your towns, but you cannot as the ai knows the whereabouts of your army. Not even mentioning the endless Hunnic hordes until you kill Attila (which can take a while) and again, just get boring.

3. The Germanic factions are practically the same, same with the Slavic factions, meaning little variety. 

4. I would rather watch paint dry instead of playing a naval battle.

5. And finally, the game has a vast amount of uninteresting DLC, the only exception being the Charlamagne DLC. This is due in part to modders being able to do a finer job of adding extra factions, I mean the Germanic one just added yet more copy paste 'Germanic' something and a couple of extra units.

Overall the game is quite poor, and if you are thinking about purchasing a Total War game, you are better of with Warhammer II to be honest, as the factions are very unique in that game.",1574291461,1574454143,False,56,19,0.660499989986419678,22,True,False,False,76561198126796282,134,6,49121,144,48075,1601066059,,

Total War Attila utilizes the traditional Total War formula in the best possible way. Newer Total War games use a different formula which might not be to the liking of every total war veteran. By combining Total War's aspect of limited strategic mobility with the struggle for survival and mobile playstyle of the Hordes an extremely rewarding and challenging experience is created.
Compared to previous Total War games calvary is much more powerful and unit upkeep is much more penalizing. 

The game occasionally experiences graphical bugs but these always are easy to resolve for me.

I absolute love the historical setting, the extreme care for details and the whole survival idea.
If I played Rome II more is purely because it has more factions (in Attila I only play as the Romans) and DLCs to spend time on, otherwise Attila is muuuuch more fun: conquering in Rome II gets boring after a while since you become basically unstoppable, instead trying to survive is always a challenge (at least until you kill Attila himself, but that's almost impossible)!
The problems of this game are only technical as it's optimised as shit and unfortunately it hasn't been polished as much as Rome II. But if you don't care about having maximum settings then it won't matter!
However, This is not a game for Total War beginners. I feel like you should first try to understand how normal tw games work and then try this one (knowing tho that it would be veeery different).

Main Drawback: The AI spams troops in full 20 stack armies like there's no tomorrow, all the while you struggle to field more than a handful of decent armies at a time. Defeat one or two full stack armies of a strong nation and that's it...you destroy them utterly or your territories will no longer be safe. Attila's troops are the biggest pest in the game by far in this regard, as they should be, but it does get aggravating when you're trying to stay on two feet while fending off wave after wave of Huns bearing down on you. Having said this I guess that's the point...the Huns were full-on and drove many nations to the brink.

13,56756866,english,"I played a lot of Total War overall, loved the original Rome: Total War and I wanted to love Attila but I just can't. While the battles are great and the combat is really solid and fun the campaign map just sucks the joy out of it for me.  The gameplay there feels ""annoyance""-based with always something bad happening (public order / squalor / war) that you only have few to none tools to deal with. Someone on reddit said it best: ""the settlements look like you have choices but actually most of the buildings are noob traps"". You have choices but they don't seem very meaningful. If you don't build exactly the right way 20 turns in advance you will get caught in a death spiral that you can't do much to get out of. Research and Characters are supremely uninspired. It feels like a very boring spreadsheet. Most of that stuff is just about very tiny percentage increases or decreases to things that are inscrutable and frankly hard to care about. To be fair the UI tries to give explanations for a lot of things but this just seems to have given the game designers carte blanch to create this zoo of stats. 

Overall the strategic level feels very contrived and inorganic as a result. The AI doesn't play their game so much as they play against you adding one more aspect of annoyance. I don't mind hard games and I think annoyance has a clear place in any game but TW just has that as their main game loop and that's too much. Nothing really good ever happens to you: you win a huge battle ""here have 7% replenishment"" LOL. Conquer a city: ""here have public order problems for the next 20 turns"". Raise an army: ""you won't ever have money ever again"". Sometimes the best thing to happen to you is that you lose a huge battle, freeing up your treasury while the AI just fucks of north again never to be seen again. 

I recently watched a long youtube series on Caesars life  and while he did have to deal with uprisings (mainly because he was being massive despot) strangely never once did he have to deal with reducing squalor in his provinces. He also became a billionaire by waging successful wars and conquered massive swaths of the known world in a few decades. He also could field 8 legions without ever going broke.

22,55750231,english,"Guys, I thought I would take a moment to give a thumbs up to what has become the best Total War game I have ever played (and I have played almost all except Shogun 2),

Playing this using the 1220 medieval mod is simply gorgeous! My version runs very smooth and stable. The graphics and the game play of this game using this mod has generated a fantastic and very beautiful game but in a historic setting that I really like.

Here you get to play out naval battles, fantastic land battles together with gorgeous sieges in a medieval Europe.

Essentially Total War Attila plus 1220 mod equals Total War Medieval 3! It really is that good. I honestly have more fun playing this then Three Kingdoms.

Only downside is the greedy high prize they charge for this game and on top of that you need the DLCs to play this mod. Shame on CA to charge so much for a five year old game.

Cudos to the modders who created this wonderful mod and essentially made a new TW game set in the medieval times.

Highly recommended if you can stomach CAs ridiculous and greedy prize (shame on you CA)

23,55693847,english,"Nietzsche once said ""God is dead and we killed him"" but after playing Total War Attila I know now who really killed God.............. It was the Huns. From five turns in to a hundred turns out the world is constantly on fire. Empires fracture, rebellions lead to additional factions, famines are seasonal and FREQUENT. Nobody trust you, nobody even likes you. Tribes you ally with will betray you and flee in times of war, your enemies will seek peace three turns into a conflict because their general revolted. The entire atmosphere of this setting screams of bleak despair. The starting armies for most factions are simple peasants in rags, the facial expressions are dull and void of happiness. 


The broken and dying world

- It's hard to balance large empires, and unlike in previous total war games that expands to the AI as well. After roughly a hundred turns the world is unrecognizable. Every superpower collapses into anarchy leaving only a few regional forces behind. This is by design, you don't get large wealthy continent spanning powers that can send +7 full stacks of elite infantry / cavalry against you. At most you find a moderately powerful faction that's using its large armies to maintain domestic stability in its three of four regions. 



Contrast to Rome  2

- There's a few factors that always come together to make Europe slide into this  bleak battle royal. First migrating tribes such as the Huns don't capture settlements......... they raze them to the ground. meaning the population is slaughtered, everything is destroyed and no one controls it. (You need to send an Army to colonize these wastlands it its expensive). Second, there's a lack of food and the AI doesn't mange it well. if your people starve they rebel, if they rebel in times of famine they grow, if the growing rebellion captures a region it holds it and fortifies it Indefinitely. 

- If Rome 2 was the nerdy highschool prep kid that got straight A's, Attila is his older edgy brother that died from a heroin overdose in college. There is no glory, there is only survival. Units aren't dressed in shinny colourful armor but with crude cold hides and chainmail, but don't mistake this for lazy unit design they look great given the atmospheric nature of the world these battles take place in. 



Diversity 

- many nations to play as from all different corners of Europe. The map is huge, It contains, Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East spanning all the way into Iran and up to Eastern Europe. Each faction has its own culture group affiliation that gives unique units as well as the different types of mercenaries available in certain regions. You can be playing as a German kingdom but if you march an army into Arabia you can recruit unique Arab units and march them back. 

- many factions posses an ability to migrate, meaning they burn down there own settlements and become a mobile tribe. From here they can fortify anywhere and build mobile improvements before traveling. Or if you fuck up royal and are about to lose a war you can just tell your armies to dip and travel to the other end of the world. The AI does this too so you could see alot of tribes and factions in places were they shouldn't be. Migrating tribes can also conquer settlements and colonize should they wish to become landed again.



Naval
- Phenomenal 
- Catapult boats are amazingly OP as one hit sinks ships, they can be used during port sieges too.
- Your navies can help with coastal sieges and that is just amazing. 
- Unique naval units that can go on land during battles. 
- Your Land Armies can also become navies by transporting them over ocean..........however they are really weak. 



In short 
- Good game, 8.5/10.
- Also yeah it's bullshit that they charge $3 for blood dlc

When I finally sat down and started to play Attila I was a little confused and kept losing major battles, only to take several weeks off of it because I was getting angry. Yet, when I came back to it later after watching tips and tricks I noticed that I need to change my thinking and tactics, it wasn’t about trying to conquer new lands or territories it was about survival. That’s what makes Attila so addicting is because your grand plans of trying to conquer the whole map might not be achievable at first because you need to survive and defend your territory first. That’s what make the experience of Rome 2 and Attila different but yet very interesting and worth putting dozens of hours in at a time.

36,55490470,english,"I have every iteration of Total War that has come out, (sans the witchcraft tutorial), and I've always loved the unique intros, cut-scenes, and General's speeches, for each faction, that were created, and dare I say, expected in latter versions.

However, the lack of unique intros, or cut-scenes, and the total lack of quality in any of Attila Total War...has left me feeling a bit sick to be honest. I purchased the game about 36 hours before the fall sale(Apparently), for about $50.00...and don't even ask me what I think of that price, for a game almost half a decade old, the next day, it was $11 and change. I purchased all DLC, with the exception of the ""red spatter effect"" for less than $25.00, and I still feel a bit ripped-off if I'm honest.

I've been a programmer most of my life, so I don't begrudge anyone for getting paid for their work...but this, this DLC was just a way to keep working on the game.(And they should have just said so.) However; they didn't, AND, they really didn't work on the game at all, in all this time...the DLC's are just more factions piled into a half-finished game.

The ""advisor"" avatar looks like it was the wet dream-child of some 10 year old, who walks around in circles in the basement, mumbling ""Something, something, something...DARK SIDE!"" over and over.

Nothing is intuitive, EVEN to those who have played all the previous renditions.
Half the game is played one way...and then when you switch to one of the Roman factions...the ENTIRE GAME mechanics change. ??? (Unfinished anyone?)

I've played...OK..WORKED at, learning this game and its mechanics for (I'm guessing here)...almost 200 hours...and I STILL cannot make sense out of half of it. Farms cause sanitation, and cultural/public unrest??? REALLY? I've lived ON A FARM and never had to worry about sanitation...and never really got upset about it. OH, and for some really strange reason...now your cities are in clumps of three, and have an extremely limited number of slots. *Which is a nice change cuz, I can remember playing many other TW games and screaming at the monitor...""OH MY GOD, Why do I have so many construction slots to use?""...wait..no...that never happened...sorry.

All the while the ""climate-change"" is pushing fertility and thus food production down. So you can either spend 60 VERY LONG turns building up a ""clump"", just to have it be a pain in the pin-feathers in a few more turns, or you can just up and leave and head south and be the last ""faction"" to start the game 40 turns in...(Face-palm).

Enemies (especially early game), can run around destroying your cities, long before you can afford to field armies to protect them, and when you do manage to build an army, it feels like there should be some Benny Hill music playing in the background as you futilely try to chase them around, and around, and around. *Daaa, nut, nut, nanna, nanna...

My favorite Total War game of all time, has to be Medieval Total War.(I play with a ton of different mods.) 
This...THIS?...feels like I've purchased the 1980's beta to the first Total War game made. :(

Even with all the DLC this game feels like I'm playing a half-finished version, or DEMO, of a game that was destined to be great, but for ""reasons/money"" they just quit working on it. I mean for Pete's sake they didn't even finish the Encyclopedia/Reference/help manual material for the game. If it wasn't for the internet...I still wouldn't have a clue. Thankfully, all the ""New"" DLC just means that all that info I've found, is either out-of-date, or just plain no longer applicable in any meaningful way.

66,55300054,english,"+ fantastic scenarios, from established but crumbling empires to migrating across the map to nomads carving out a place to settle down to just playing as the huns and burning the entire map until NOTHING is left
+ great expansions in The Last Roman and the Charlemagne campaign, the latter of which fixes several of the problems at the campaign level 
+ Western Roman Empire is a masochistic, ""who the fuck is declaring war on me this time"" survival horror where you abandon 1/3 of your empire, and another 1/3 becomes a 10v1 battleground with end-turns of over an hour of certain-defeat small-town battles and I LOVE IT
+ Climate change as an escalation mechanic across the campaign forcing factions into conflict as they stop being able to feed their provinces and have to move to greener pastures


- Climate change is a poorly-developed/explained escalation mechanic across the campaign leading to players making the 'wrong' choices especially wrt farms and province development, which can leave you in a game-restarting catch-22 scenario.
- runs like a steaming turd on the best of machines.  I did not have this on SSD initially and could do workouts while loading up battles
- city building/province management seems 'deep' but is 'complex'.  That is, there are lots of dependencies between buildings, eg farms generate food but reduce public order and squalour, so you need sanitation and happiness buildings etc, leading to many 'wrong' choices, one 'right' choice and cookie-cutter builds across every province.  I'm talking ""plague-ridden hellhole that doesn't make enough money for the permanent garrison to defend it"" vs ""metaphorical gold mine"" (the literal gold mines are a trap and actually aren't worth developing because of how much they fuck the province what in the actual fuck CA)


I spent way too many hours on this game, and not just in OCD province management making sure I'd upgraded everything.  Being the ludicrously-rich Eastern Roman Empire (or late-game WRE once you fix everything) and saying ""I'm going to pay you 200,000 gold to fuck off and attack each other"" every turn is immensely enjoyable.  Even with all the awful broken garbage and bad design choices (the province design should be in classes as an example of how NOT to do this) I still played several campaigns in this game and loved every one of them*.

13,54746080,english,"Ok here is my review. First time so take it easy on me. 

-Very challenging game, especially when you play either Roman Factions. 
-A.I. is kind of dumb in both battles and global map. 
-Huns are very annoying to play against.
-Game almost forces you NOT to totally destroy an army. In the case of the Huns, if you defeat an army of theirs, another full stacked army spawns the next turn. Might as well just take out the good units and let your boy Attila hire weak mercs.
-I have NO clue why it is so hard to get someone into a trade agreement with you. 
-Very diverse units, which in turn lets you employ diverse tactics. Rome is very structured and has hardy infantry, Slavs have very fast units which allow you to outmaneuver Romans. ect. 
- Soundtrack is pretty good. 
-Food is annoying, but a good mechanic.
-Ship battles are boring, but sometimes nice to change it up.
- Diplomacy mechanic kind of sucks. For example, I once subjugated the Franks to use them as a cushion against the Huns. The very next turn they declared war on me. Psh.
- DLC is pricey, but if you enjoy the game it is very worth the price. Especially the Desert Kingdom DLC. 
-Factions are very different from each other, but similar factions (i.e. the Desert Kingdoms) are the pretty much the same, with the only difference is one trait. Same buildings, units, tactics, ect.
- A.I. do very annoying things sometimes, like send a small army which you have to chase down for 5 turns as it attacks and beats your garrison and then sacks the town.

All in all, a very good time waster when I am feeling like I want a challenging game. Other total war games are just not the same. Yes even Total War: Warhammer II. That game is just too easy.

Pros:
+The new squalor system works surprisingly well. 
+Religion makes a return and it's really fun to try and speed-convert a certain religion. Each one is unique and provides cool buildings
+battles are a lot better than other games. Each city (for the most part) has a unique layout, and your developments can actually be seen on the battle map. 
+Fire spreading mechanic is really fun to use against your enemies' cities
+Tech trees provide a great sense that your faction is ""advancing"". Germanic units start with cloth uniforms and little training, but in the late game they all have heavy armor and more battle formations to choose from

Cons:
-Playing as the Roman factions can be fucking annoying. (With an AI playing) West Rome falls almost a century before it's supposed to, and East Rome doesnt put up a big enough fight despite being the richest faction in the game. The tech trees are nonsensical (I LOSE access to my best Roman techs when I research christian techs?). Plus you literally have to cheat to win battles. It's common to fight some 3-4 outnumbered battles a turn.
-Religions are not balanced. Most of the religions have obvious pros and cons, usually in the form of sacrificing one thing for another. The most widespread religion in the game, Christianity, SUCKS. Churches are too expensive to maintain and give few other bonuses besides big conversion rates. Ironically Roman factions are better off returning to Roman-paganism and building its unique temples. Even then, RP requires literally hundreds of food and is hard to maintain in the late game.
-Huns are overpowered and not fun to play as/against. Kill an army and they'll immediately respawn. When Attila comes of age they literally have 0% upkeep, and to stop the huns you have to kill Attila THREE TIMES.
-Fertility and climate change events are not handled well. There's no way to improve the fertility of your lands when climate change hits. I know it's supposed to motivate all the barbarians to travel southward but really it's more of a handicap so that youre forced to sit tight and defend against the Hunnic invasion for the next 20 years. Food gets really scarce to the point that you cant feed half your faction, even when the majority of them have 2-3 farm buildings.

TL;DR 
Attila total war provides a lot to the table, but most of it is too hard to chew. AI is unfair, new mechanics are broken,  early game is annoying and late game is boring.

45,54194447,english,"I have been waiting to review this for a while, especially since I have probably some 1000 h of this on my old computer. In my humble opinion this is the best Total War game up to date. Can't say for Three Kingdoms yet, I haven't played that one yet, but Total War: Atiila captured the essence of these series. It perfected the formula of Total War: Rome II, and added it's on atmosphere. The theme is collapse, the collapse of the Western civilization, mostly focusing on the Western Roman empire. For me, as a historian, this period in history is especially interesting mostly because we know so little of it compared to the earlier periods. Rome collapses, with the Church saving it's legacy as knowledge and similary this game echoes the apocalyptic feeling. And yet, not only is it possible to reform, save the empire, which I often do replaying this game probably once a year, but it also gives the insight of other nations. Just as it was historicly, some nations, or tribes, people, despite the climate change, not only survive but also thrive. I like to roleplay in such a manner, that I play one main campaign which I focus mostly on, thata always the Western Roman empire, and then I play some additional ones I have not tries before. I like to imagine, that somenof them would ally with the Romans in their last ditch effort to save the empire. For example, I am yet to finish the complicated Lakhmid campaig fully, but I ussualy run away from the Sassanids, they attack ERE, I betray them and from that point onwards fight them. Similary, as the Venedetians I fight the Huns in the teritories of novaday Eastern-Central Europe and when playing as the Romans I ally wih them. The thing is, this game makes it possible. It shows you these different perspectives, you can be a Pict or Norseman who relishes in the cold, or experience the might of the Persian/Sassanid empire, flank your enemies in the desert where Northern armies would die out. Point is, this game immerses  you fully. Therefore I plead to CA, please, optimize this game, maybe add some DLC alongsixe a huge commercial. It has the potencial to be so much more memorable and profitable than, for example, Total War Rome II, simply because it is so much harder but also rewarding.",1563626241,1563626241,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,76561198221502256,59,1,17490,0,13003,1580726643,,

Unfortunately the game (on the default difficulty setting) grinds to a halt before any of the several major enemy factions have been destroyed.

I fell in love with the challenge, and I feel like most negative reviews are sore players who can't take the heat of constantly being defeated and pressured by factions much bigger than you. It's not an easy game to start, but once you get into the hang of how it plays then it's a piece of cake. 

Furthermore, it is a STRATEGY game. In other words in requires PROBLEM SOLVING and CRITICAL THINKING. Multitasking large armies also is crucial; I cannot begin to describe the amount of battles where I was focusing on moving my right flank forward all the while the rear of my left flank had been BOOTY LICKED by shock cavalry without me even knowing until it was too late.

As far as getting bored, most likely not going to happen. Every campaign is unique yet some aspects are predetermined (such as hostilities with factions of a rival culture or religion. Hostilities don't usually arise immediately, and in some ways they can be prevented, too. ). But as far as my 750 hours or so goes, I've never thought ""aghh this is so predictable and easy to cheese"" because it isn't. The AI is wonderfully fabricated and is almost like facing real players in the campaign, except of course the AI don't have human flaws such as the inability to micromanage 7000 units at a time and still maintain an offensive/defensive.


So yeah, the game is hard in the beginning, especially for me since I had never played a TBS/RTS game in my life besides halo wars.

30,52975729,english,"Absolutely mind-blowing of a game...


Let me start this off by saying that there is no perfect game, and there is no perfect Total War game. Each TW game offers its own set of challenges and gameplay. However, there is usually common problems among most TW games which are all similar to a point. I mean stuff like
-lack of end-game challenge (big with games like Rome II and Shogun)
-lack of a challenge in general for seasoned players
-average/non-exciting battles
-boring campaign map
and the list goes on...

The reason i listed these is because what every other Total War game gets wrong...this game does RIGHT.
For example, 

1. End- game challenge in this game is huge, especially with the Huns. I played as Eastern Roman Empire, and i basically owned 3/4ths of the entire map after steamrolling through 25 barbarian cities, but the Huns still managed to keep me on the edge of the seat, as i anticipated their moves and devoted 6 armies to fight them. Lets just say that you will NEVER get bored when playing this game (for the most part)

2. This game is arguably the HARDEST Total War game in the franchise. At time it feels like a survival game. For example, in Rome II, you would build armies, conquer lands, rinse and repeat. In Attila it is more like trying to defend your weak cities against a billion different hordes with their own unique systems and its just awesome. And for those who are new to the game, there are PLENTY of easy factions to play where you can just raid and pillage.

3. The battles in this game are insane. To put it simply-- the amount and variety of each unique faction and their units will always have you changing your strategies and tactics to keep the game fresh. If you try to use the same strategy against every faction, your armies will get obliterated. For example, you have heavily armored Cataphracts in the East, very skilled (and sometimes overpowered) horse archers from the steppe, Roman heavy infantry from the empires, Viking raiders from the North, and all kinds of barbarian troops from all over. Oh and Elephants still exist. The siege battles are also a big part of the game, which are also epic. Defender's advantage is highlighted in this game. Fighting on the walls, watchtowers, firing on advancing enemies, its all at the defender's advantage. You can't just march through enemy settlements capturing their cities with your countless cheap levies anymore. It requires much more strategy. Numbers wont mean a thing in siege battles in this game, and there have been times where i have held off a whole stack with just the garrison. 

4. This game does the campaign map right. Unlike other games where its always the same and stagnant, Attila changes it up a bit. The map is always changing. Fertility is a new factor which is dynamic and always changing. Climate change, razing of land by hordes, abandonment all affect this new feature. Another cool ability is religion. Now other TW games have had religion but this one is the best. First of all, the variety in religion is astonishing. There are 4 different types of Christianity if that tells you anything. And like 6 different types of Paganism. There are always events happening based on the year, which are always affecting your campaign. And diplomacy is badass. It borrows a lot from past games, but factions act more like themselves. The Danes are warmongering and always raiding. Huns are constantly sacking cities and obtaining tributes. It feels very real.

So like i said in the beginning, no games are perfect and this one has a few issues like:

Some units are pretty overpowered like Shock cavalry get a ridiculous 250 charge bonus which obliterated even armored spearmen
Javelins do WAY TOO MUCH damage
Huns cheat....just a bit...maybe more....ok maybe a lot.

But each of these can be balanced and fixed. like Shock cavalry have very little defense and will get slaughtered if they stay in combat too long. And javelins can be killed via archers, slingers, or cavalry. And the Huns cheating...well thats something you'll have to deal with or just use some mods.

So IN CONCLUSION, this game is good for newbies and experienced players alike, and offers a challenging and fun gameplay which will always keep you at the edge of your seat. 10/10 and DO BUY!!!!",1562010573,1562011082,True,1,0,0.522058844566345215,0,True,False,False,76561198868075305,35,11,10243,0,8443,1588547156,,
31,52934670,english,"Challenging, entertaining, deep, dark and probably one of the best Total War games released to this date.
I'm going to talk about the grand campaign map mostly so get comfortable because here I go:
Throat singing is op in this game, AI Attila is basically a cheater in god mode who only then manages to die when his mum cuts off his internet for obnoxious screaming in his room during a family dinner after he loses in combat 3 - 10 times despite his artificial advantage of being a unbeatable force. You can play as the man himself too, but don't expect the same kind of treats as the AI receives.
Best advice for beginners is to start as a small kingdom located in Scandinavia/Britannia/Africa/Asia as fast expansion and huge wide borders at the start are more than a crippling disadvantage and a major pain in the ass to manage. 
So for rookies, don't go for Western Roman Empire at the start, you find yourself uninstalling the game during the first 15 turns, it's really that depressing but you can get back to it once you're better at the game. 
Trade and diplomacy are really important, at first they seem overwhelmingly boring but as soon as you realize what advantage they bring, you get used to the system quickly. It's a fun system in my opinion, and sometimes the AI actually makes sense in their deals. Also, to really prosper in this game you have to learn how to micromanage your settlements. 
Planning ahead and balancing your settlements to be optimal as possible is crucial, as you can basically ruin everything for making just a few poor choices that didn't seem bad at first. You are able to migrate your people but it's really an escape button when everything goes wrong and you want to gain a second chance, or for situations where you want to cultivate more safe and nutritious lands than your current ones, maybe life off the land and surprise attack a kingdom you've weakened with your presence. You can fail at all of these, and it can cost you a new campaign start. Migration sure has it's ups and downs. There are even factions called 'great migrators' that have natural traits for being migrating people. 
Game also brings a scary message about climate change, and it shows as an exaggerated global ice age at some point in the campaign. So you REALLY need to plan ahead where to expand, how to manage resources, settlements, fleets and your armies. Keep an eye out for the nutrition values of the lands you own and plan to own as it gives an idea how big of an population/military you can sustain at the moment and in the future. Attrition warfare is brutal, make sure you prepare to use it in offense and defend your faction against it. 
The game also loves events and bringing plague to your lands so always have some food and gold in reserve. 
Family and court relations are important, always keep a guy in office you want and won't stab you in the back, be aware of their traits and skills and don't arrange marriages you won't benefit from, watch out for both women and men who like to perform adultery and make illegitimate bastards, it's bad for the moral. Plus make the best use of your governors skills in the settlements. Same goes with the generals, weed out the weak and unpleasant ones, get only the best men to lead your armies and prepare in advance to give your throne to a worthy heir. 
Make use of priests, spies and champions once you get them. Really, they are very useful.
With power and reach you become a threat to the other kingdoms. The bigger you are, the bigger the plots are going to be against you. 
This is where diplomacy comes to the action, don't make yourself a red glowing global target. Least you can do is to make yourself a valuable ally to some. 
You really need trustworthy allies beyond your borders so the front line won't be in your home, helping your allies defending is much more easier than fighting several enemies at once or trying to defend your lands alone.
You can try to be a lone neutral power but never a true one, as that requires trade and manipulation plus good luck that you won't get invaded just by the sole reason of existing. Get to know your neighbors, the game gives them random personalities and behavior when you start a new game so you can learn how to deal and work with them. 
Coordination with your allies is important too, AI can be dumb at times but it can help you greatly at times if you try to seek brothers in arms for your wars, especially when Attila grows to be an responsible adult and takes the charge of the Huns to fight global warming by waging war to every possible nation that crosses the terrible pathfinding of his armies. 
Attila focuses on bringing down larger empires, WR and ER being the first natural enemies so if you want to stay out of his way in your playthrough, don't ally Rome or be a large empire in middle of Europe, worst scenario is trying to provoke him as a small pagan migrator.
After you've learned the basics and advanced stuff of the game and at least finished one campaign where you have experienced the management of a large and wide empire, then you could try the WR and ER campaigns out with better results. But to be honest, you aren't given the most optimal start in either of those two. You ARE given the reigns of the two most powerful empires of that time, but at the same time you're given the reigns of two most powerful empires that are beginning to fall and degrade. 
You have to race against all odds thrown at you, in the WR one you're basically trying to damage control your overly expanded empire, with some of the lands completely isolated from your capital. Rebellion, famine, pagan lords and Attila are really testing you. Religion plays a big role in every playthrough, and if you're starting out as one of Romes I'd really check how much the church upkeep costs are and are they necessary while the very empire you're leading is crumbling down.
I'm yet experience the The Last Roman and Age of Charlemagne campaigns but at quick glance they seem to offer unique and interesting ways to play through them.
Tactical gameplay is very enjoyable and satisfying, UI is easy to use, everything works smooth and the numerous units that the game brings are fairly balanced, to a certain point at least. Learn hotkeys and how to group certain units together. Use their abilities and don't let your general sit far behind the lines where you can't use his presence to boost your troops combat skills. Be tactical. 
Naval combat is also a fun addition but it's not really where the game's strong sides are. 
The ground combat is great to be honest, and if you don't want to take part in every skirmish then the auto-solve works well enough to counter battles that are certain wins. Never auto-solve a battle you know you'll lose, you can do more damage to their numbers by actually fighting it real-time, sometimes you might even win against the odds. Never trust the auto-solve button when defending and attempting siege and absolutely never against Attila The Hun.
I recommend this game and hopefully this worked as both a review and a little tutorial how to approach this title, it's pretty different from other Total War games.
tl;dr version: Game is good in every aspect (minus the little swallow naval battles, artificially difficult Huns and some of the generic copy and paste kingdoms from the Slavic DLC), play and learn. Get good, then play some more.",1562002098,1562011077,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197993908135,226,2,5001,0,4724,1588618080,,

The downsides are rather apparent as they exist in many of the Total war games as far as I've noticed.  Nonsensical AI (should speak for itself), factions can get rather bland but as long as you switch up cultural groups you can avoid this somewhat avoid this, lack of current interest from Creative to put out more content (despite other older titles getting some love) and just like with most games mods cant fix everything.

79,52472035,english,"Total war Attila is by far one of the most challenging total war games to date. The game is undeniably difficult and can and on many occasions cause you to reload a save or restart the game entirely. this is especially apparent when playing as the Western Roman Empire or Eastern Roman Empire.

The game is set in a chaotic period of wars, civil strife, climate change, political intrigue and corruption runs rampant. The Western Roman Empire is plagued by civil wars, corruption, wars, ineffective governors and poor administration. It becomes on the brink of collapse. Its made worst by migrating hordes of factions that range from germans, slavs, nordic and various nations running from the ever looming threat of the Huns that would later be lead by Attila himself.

The Eastern Roman Empire however, flourished well and have access to one of the richest provinces in its territories such as Aegyptus. (Modern day Egypt) Ruling from its new seat of power a new capital called Constantinople.(Modern day Istanbul)
Constantinople was considered a new Rome, a better Rome. While old Rome was neglected and its population reduced and nothing more than a cultural centre at best. Eastern Rome would be the more powerful Brother of the Western Romans. Even still your position is precarious as to the east, Romes's age Enemy, the Parthian empire is now under a newer management, The Sassanid Empire, and it seeks whatever opportunities to seize back the lands once belonged to the old Persian Empire, The Achaemenid Empire. To the north migrating hordes like the visigoth would sack your lands with ease if left unchecked.

You also get to play as African nations that had traded with Rome once before and yield to its power, now found itself with new opportunity to carve out newer kingdoms. 

Or play as the Huns led by Attila the Scourge of God. Renowned for their OP horse archer tactics they would cause terror to much of Europe. Surprisingly, the Huns have quite good infantry for some reason even through they're a mostly nomad horse faction.

The game focuses a lot on cavalry to win battles than before and the more emphasis is placed on your general not dying as a general dying would cause massive morale penalties that can cause a mass route. Spear infantry are also a lot more valuable to counter heavy cavalry tactics but spear infantry must brace well against the charge as collision without a proper bracing formation would cause mass routes.

The game is inherently more difficult you will find it rather challenging and you would realise that carving out an empire is a lot more easier than maintaining one. But if you want a more challenging total war game, this game would be great.

[u][i]The Verdict:[/i][/u][/h1]
TW: Attila gave me a good time while playing, but it adds almost nothing new to the series. That, mixed with the essential content being thrown it sparse DLCs, I can’t recommend the game to anyone. There are cheaper titles with even more content and have similar mechanics, like Shogun 2 and Empire, and also there are newer better for casuals, like Warhammer 1 & 2 and the upcoming 3K, which you should be on the lookout.

[h1]Review averages:

General:[/h1]

[i]Note: I’m reviewing only the combat system of the game here. I think CA suck on city management, and Attila failed to deliver, as all other TW I’ve experienced, a good city managing system[/i]

[list][*][b]Mechanics: 8/10. I’ve gotta say as a newcomer to the series, battling was really addictive. [/b] I’ve played Medieval 2 before, but only on friend’s places. Decided to go for ATTILA after almost ten years later, and the combat system is something I’ve never seen. Choosing formation accordingly, building a balanced army and learning with your mistakes. It does it’s job here.

[*][b] Graphics/Interface: 7.5/10. Graphics are fine, and interface fits the game.[/b] It’s not exceptional though, and you need DLCs to have a wider range of variety, along with mods to get better textures.

[*][b]Content/Surprises: 6.5/10. While campaigns have some good challenges, the game feels too repetitive with a lot of different factions and settings.[/b] Also, there’s a constant need of scripted events to bring the “famine” and starvation feeling, hindering any concrete progress, leading to some frustration. Charlemagne DLC felt way better. 

[*][b]Lore/Story: 8/10. No complaints here, the game does have some historical accuracy, which fits my levels of exigency.[/b] Quests challenges you to change historical events, and scripted events try to follow their historical settings.

[*][b]Music/Sound: 6/10. There are some good SFX, but there are less speeches, and a lot of repeated noises. Music is bland and does not add to the experience.[/b]
[/list]

[h1]Extras:[/h1]

[list][*][b]Greediness: 4.5/10. This game is above average greedy. [/b]Instead of packing some good 2 to 3 DLCS, with a lot of content on each, the game breaks down into  8 DLCs, taking off basic features like BLOOD AND GORE, something you would expect from a game that it’s main factor is it’s realistic and immersive battles. Diversity of the game is only found after buying some good 6 DLCs. Really disappointing.

[*][b] Bugs and performance: 7/10. I have not encountered a single bug in my playthroughs, and that was a surprise.[/b] Maybe I’m much of a casual, but in my 60 hours of this game I have yet to experience a crash. 

[*][b]Worthiness: 5/10. DLCs could’ve been smarter, with a more fair content. [/b]The game is somewhat worth it, but I feel ripped off that I have to buy a separate DLC for blood and gore content.

On legendary the battles are very agressive the enemy will rarely wait for you unless you are besieging a settlement, so the best tactic (on open field) is to always try to attract the enemy, with exactly 6 units of shock cavalry, I say attract because very rarely they will divide their forces, so their whole army will chase and you lead them to a position where your main army (infantry, archers) will be in formation and facing the enemy flank, then you push the flank and sacrifice 3 units of cav to hold the enemy cav and use the remaining to aid your infantry win the battle quickly. BUT if you have a decisive cavalry superiority eliminate the enemy cavalry first. Always try to have a supporting army with mixed troops close to you to change to the troops you need before entering battle.

62,50959235,english,"Attila is, in my opinion, the best Total War.

A lot of people complain about optimization issues, I'm not saying they're lying, but I don't have these issues so it's not impossible to run the game properly.

What Attila does GREAT is giving you very different campaign experiences: you can pick from massive empires under pressure, small tribes with one settlement, small hordes that have to flee from the Huns and try to conquer some land and settle down, or as a massive horde that will grow, loot and pillage.

The battles are (or can be) rewarding as cavalry is super strong in this game, though also vulnerable, especially when pulling out of engagements. General deaths have a big impact here compared to most other TW's. Your tactics matter more than in for instance Rome 2 or Warhammer TW where the outcome of a fight relies more on stats and the stat differences between units are a lot bigger.

This is the last TW to date to have naval battles. While naval battles themselves are functional, but by no means excellent, joined ground- and amphibious assaults on settlements or simply land battles where the enemy is reinforcing from the sea are simply epic.

A lot of units have formations, special abilities or traits that are useful in certain situations, encouraging you to build a balanced army.

The AI is competent enough to be a threat (especially the Huns can be scary to fight), yet can still be outsmarted in ways that are rewarding to the player. The battles are fast-paced enough (unlike in Rome 2) to give you some challenge micro-wise, though it's certainly doable for less experienced players too on lower difficulty settings.

Settlements during sieges are very well-designed and protecting them as well as attacking them can be done in a variety of ways, and if you do it right you can avoid a lot of casualties. This requires some patience but can be very rewarding.

Setting buildings and trees on fire to demoralize and burn enemies is a thing unique to this Total War which I'm not sure why hasn't been implemented in future installments. Most importantly, it's fun here.

The time period is really interesting, as this is where the Western Roman Empire fell and Germanic tribes started carving out the kingdoms that eventually became the modern nations we know today. This plays off against the war in the East between the Eastern Roman Empire and the Sassanids (and their many vassal states), and the massive Hunnic invasion, which will be a good late-game challenge to keep your campaign interesting, since the AI isn't going to stop the Huns and as you grow your empire, they will almost inevitably show up at your doorstep.

I can also safely say that if you're looking for a challenge, you will find it here. Since they decreased the effect of corruption perhaps playing as either empire will have become easier since I first played the game, but in a lot of campaigns there is a lot you can do and the longterm strategic direction to take isn't clear cut. You have to carve your own path, make choices with pros and cons, and adjust according to changing circumstances (like decreased fertility or Hunnic invasions) throughout...

Family management is clean and simple, gathering and maintaining influence is important, encouraging you to use your faction leader and heir as a general (though also putting you at risk of losing them, which can have serious consequences), and you can take several actions within your court that can give you some advantages by spending influence. The only annoying thing here is that subjects can become really annoyed because you're appointing offices to 'lower ranked' people, and it's not always clear who's 'lower ranked'.

Generals have rewarding skill trees that help with upkeep, unit buffs, movement range etc. or (if they're governors) administration of settlements. Their effects aren't completely imbalanced like they are in Warhammer TW, though. While not immortal, their lifespans are long enough to get those heroic generals that create their own stories within the campaign, really become the standout characters in the story of your campaign, and potentially build a legacy (though, children die a LOT in this Total War).

The building tech trees are expansive and open up several options for maxing profits and generating the things you need (public order, sanitation, recruitment...). Religion plays an active part in the campaign as different religions each provide different bonuses.

The regular tech tree is split into military and civic improvements and is quite interesting because they give you useful advantages, but sometimes you might want to skip them to reach a more advanced tech faster. Again, your choices matter.

None of these 'extra's' are completely mandatory to do, but they can help you and they do add some depth to the campaign if you're looking for it.

The graphics are like a much more polished version of Rome 2, with darker and more realistic colours.

My one major criticism of Attila is that as you research units, the lower tier units become unavailable, and sometimes the upgraded unit is a very different kind of unit, and not necessarily better gold or efficiency-wise, and sometimes you just want some cheap troops. Their upkeep costs also tend to be quite high, often times more so than the unit can justify.

On the other hand, of course, this also helps keep your late game campaigns interesting since you will have stronger armies, but you can't spam endless stacks of elite troops and simply overwhelm everyone.

I tried out Rome 2 but I noticed I couldn't send units around the campaign map without generals. Sometimes I want to scout ahead of a main army with cavalry, or split up an army, or send a few units to a local garrison, or any number of things that require this ability. The inability to do something so simple, strategic, and historical boded so poorly for the game that I reckoned I wouldn't like it and had Steam refund it.

Part 2
Later I decided to try out Attila. I knew that horrible mechanic would be in this game, but I figured I could suck it up and maybe have fun. Nope. One of the first things I noticed is that there's yet another ridiculous, unfun, unhistorical, unstrategic, nonsensical, unrealistic, anti-freedom mechanic. This one has a name: ""imperium"", and it limits how many individual armies you can have at once. Good design would limit the number of troops you can field through mechanics like money, food, and population, not some vague, fantastical concept like ""imperium"".

71,50847933,english,"I must say I like this game a lot. Originally I purchased it during a sale, not thinking too much about it. For a long time, I expected it to be almost the same game as Rome II, but in a different time period. But how wrong I was... Yes, TWA is similar to Rome II in many ways, but it is also far superior in others. In fact, I would go as far as to say that this game is a direct upgrade of its predecessor. A lot of times, it feels as if someone took many the things that Rome II did in an annoying way, and fixed them.

First of all, let's just quickly go over the negative aspects, to get those out of the way:

[list]
[*] It's after all a Total War title, and naturally, there are a few bugs here and there. I won't (and quite frankly don't know if I even could) explain exactly what they are unless I wrote an entire book about it, but as far as I have been able to tell, it has not been anything game-breaking.
[*] Sometimes units don't quite behave like you would expect them to. And that applies both to the enemy AI as well as how your own troops seem to interpret your commands. Then again, it's a Total War title, and we all know that this is an issue with all those games.
[*] Naval combat feels overall lacking and not as immersive as you would expect. Contrary to that, I have seen people on YouTube praising the naval combat in this game, but personally, I don't quite see it.
[*] The game is quite hungry for graphics and performance, especially during large battles. It can of course be tweaked to improve performance, but it is worth to mention for users with a slower machine. I would probably not want to try this game on a laptop.
[/list]

Now, let's take a look at the positives:

[list]
[*] The political system is for once really interesting. Compared to Rome II's upgraded system, TWA has fewer options, but a lot more depth to each one. Instead of just pressing some buttons to increase your power and the loyalty of others, you must actually think a bit more about it, and balance things up. There are advantages, disadvantages and consequences from almost every action you undertake, and there is always a risk things will backfire at you.
[*] Building your cities will require more planning. Unlike previous games, where you only really needed to worry about public order, and later food, TWA also includes a measure of sanitation and squalor, which will affect the risk of disease outbreaks. In order to balance up those three, as well as maintaining growth, income and religious influence, you will quickly realize that you might need to compromise something.
[*] Siege battles in this game actually feel like sieges. For the first time ever in a Total War game, a siege will need actual planning. Your troops don't just magically receive ladders out of thin air. Furthermore, your towers will actually be useful in repelling enemy siege towers, battering rams and other siege equipment. Because of all this, the walls of your cities are truly useful, the archers work as a great defensive unit, and just as in a real siege, a smaller defensive force can be capable of holding off a much larger attacking force. Compare this with previous games in the series, where the city wall wasn't much more than a glorified obstacle.
[*] You have more control over how you manage your nation and your cities. Again, comparing TWA to Rome II, you can really tell how much more freedom you as a player have, to decide how events should play out. There are still certain limits based on which faction you play as, but to a lower degree than in Rome II.
[*] It's overall a more challenging game. For the reasons mentioned above, as well as a lot of other features that come into play, TWA has a much slower development and progression. After a certain number of turns in Rome II, you're likely to already be a full-fledged empire, dominating the whole world, with no threats left. After the same amount of turns in TWA however, you're likely to still be a small nation struggling to survive against your greedy neighbours and the migrating hordes.

74,50798418,english,"This is a good game that is mired by unfortunate and persistent issues (AI, pathfinding issues, odd mix of units [some factions have a ton of variety, others are mostly cookie cutter units], among other issues). 

I had this feeling that the game was somewhat barebones in some ways that was not overwhelming/bad enough to steer me away from it, but was noticeable and annoying.

One major issue that plagued the experience was the seemingly useless/unnecessary variety of units that had identical stats. In other words, the ""variety"" was merely superficial, as units looked different/had different names, but were either identical or functionally were about the same.

Also, a huge annoyance was the seeming futility of ranged units. This really weakened the experience and made the use of ranged units unsatisfying/useful. Removing a core component like this was especially upsetting when so many factions are ranged heavy/focused (esp. the Huns).

However, the mod community has done a terrific job of building on the game and incorporating much needed features and tweaks. Age of Charlemagne campaign was MUCH better than the original game, particularly when modded (namely, Radious). 

Overall, I would recommend this (with mods, of course) to fans of the series, ONLY if it is on sale for $30 or less. I am very pleased with my purchase and enjoyed the game very much.

97,49973890,english,"Not much positive about this game. Some terrible design choices and mechanics in the game. Many positives about Rome 2 have been thrown out of the window.

Firstly the ranged infantry is stupidly powerful in the early game. Cheap slingers can rack up over a 100 kills each in a battle as if the levy shields are just holograms. Every volley decimates a unit and is even more extreme when javelinmen are used. In rome 2, which i like to compare, the ranged units work over time to get kills and slowly wear down the enemy. and would only be able to kill pikemen in the same way as standard infantry in attila. Part of the problem is the increased ranged infantry size to equal melee infantry while the cav has also increased. These 2 changes imbalance the game greatly.
   Some things make no sense. mercenary onager costs 1000 gold per turn but mercenary CELTIC onager costs 200?!?!
   Pikes are useless unless in very specific scenarios and 1v1 against standard units head on can actually lose, charging is always more beneficial than forming a shield wall.
   Public order is a nightmare to deal with. Ive had immigration penalties of up to -18 with -4 and -4 for tax and difficulty. Yet another unnecessary difficulty to deal with.

My main problem rests with the hordes and the huns. probably worst kind of difficulty i have ever experienced in a game. 
-I only discovered the counter late in the game which is large onagers. Other than skirmishers in siege battles the only thing that can touch the hunnic horse archers are explosive rounds; arrows and sling stones will maybe kill a couple of horses due to the extreme armour. These units are so OP its unreal. They fire like machine guns and a spam of them can easily defeat any standard army. Most foot archers are garbage
-Once you begin the inevitable war with the huns there will be 4 20 stacks in your land at any given time. Any army you destroy will be replaced with a new one next turn. Any army you damage will fill up with mercenaries immediately, meaning you are actually better off leaving some enemies alive. Most armies are identical in terms of units present. All units are tier 2 and 3 while early on all of yours are tier 1 and 2. Horse archers will each get 150 kills per battle without fail unless large onagers are used.
- There seems to be no way to defeat the huns once on the back foot. They do not play the same game as the player and just ruin the game, making the map a mess in the process. Unless you have a good start away from the huns on normal difficultly and have access to large onagers you will get in trouble quickly
- the army travelling ability is ridiculous. 1 army in ur land will outrun all your armies and all the while be razing ur land. ridiculously unbalanced

Edit- a few extra issues ive come across.

Rank experience system is awful. Somehow you can recruit units of 7+ XP but they will always decrease in rank no matter what it seems. Really frustrating mechanic which should be the other way round.
Converting enemy settlements costs over 10k every time, ridiculously expensive.
Rebels seem to get the best units including large onagers every time even if you arent capable of producing them.

Cons
   Let me tell you a story about the game studio Creative Assembly. It was a promising studio. They gained the confidence of a customer by creating Shogun 2. It was an optimized and simplistic Total War game that was fun. As Todd Howard said ""It just works"". The next addition to the Total War franchise Rome 2, did not gain the confidence of the customer. He did not buy it because it was unoptimized and crappy on its release. The customer  had some confidence left for Creative Assembly and waited for the next release. Back at Creative Assembly, they thought of the next release. ""Shit"" said Creative Assembly, ""Lets create a new game that is basically Rome 2 but with big baddie Huns and burning shit."" And so they did.
   The unsuspecting customer was sold by this sales pitch. He bought the game full price at 60 dollars. ""No way they would release unoptimized and unfun shit after the Rome 2 debacle."" said the customer. When he opened it, he found it was unoptimized and full of unfun shit. The game looked horrible, Shogun 2 a four year old game, looked way better on lowest settings and its fps wasn't shit. Unit variety could only be described as a copy pasta. Battles were way too long and clunky. Sanitation was/is still an annoying mechanic. But wait a minute, with this new razing settlement feature you can burn the heathens who forgot how to take a fucking bath. Only its really used by the Huns cause resettlement takes too much time and money. Defeating multiple stacks of elite Hunnic armies gets rewarded with instant respawning of the same Hunnic armies. The customer said, "" Jesus, have I really spent this many hours on this game? Well, it could be because of the long ass useless garrison battles and way too long kill times of units. Plus, I didn't even get to play the game for the majority of the time spent. I spent most of the time waiting out the end turn so i can get a win as one faction.

the campaign MAP and system is very different to what i'm used to but i think the improvements are really great. I like the new family tree system and also the new generals/recruitment system stops small stacks running all over the place cluttering the map. the agents systems is also an improvement from IMO I really hated the medieval 2 days of priests and imams just moving to and fro. diplomacy also seems to have more options i haven't played enough to know if its broken in vanilla though seems to be working fine for now.

53,49646356,english,"This game is my favorite Total War game behind several older titles like Medieval II, Rome the first, and there are several reason why.

The first of those is the fact that the HUD isn't really in aggressive tones of colors, unlike its counterpart of Rome II (I will draw a lot of comparison with that one). People might complain about the lack of color, but all in all I believe that a tame HUD makes for a less tiring experience visualizing your infrastructures and armies and immersing yourself in the game better.

The second is the unit cards, which are superior to the convoluted and vague one of Rome II. This is the big drawback in the Age of Charlemagne expansion, which pretty much killed my playing intent and made it very hard to visualize easily what my unit composition in my armies were; in Attila, you can directly visualize in-game engine rendering of your units on their unit cards, making it rather easy to read. The same can almost be said of the buildings. While some buildings are represented in-game, most of them have unique cards that are also rather easy to visualize, making for an extremely good, speedy time at managing regions, provinces, and armies overall.

All in all, the presentation of this game is miles better than Rome II, and while Rome or Warhammer fans have adapted themselves to the simplistic HUD, I can say with confidence that this game instead seeks to attract other audiences than the usual players by making the game more user-friendly; which is a shame, considering how lowkey it is.

The gameplay is what we expect of a Total War game, with some new features that are now commonplace as of Warhammer : Total War : settlement damage and horde mechanics. Hordes are essentially cities fused with armies : good offensive potential, but provide with a fragile economy and defense requiring you to always be at war and running from your more powerful enemies. Settlement damage reduces the moral of the defenders the more the settlement is ""burned"", with a completely destroyed settlement essentially insuring the defenders will break almost at contact with their foes.

The campaign objectives were rather fun to complete, althought I'm sad there wasn't a more casual mode without them. The meat of the subjects are the mechanics.

Attila is played on a span of fifty five years (from 395 to 450), divided in four seasons each (a turn in game term), and this timespan is divided in several ""periods"", which provide for faction objectives rewarding you with gold if completed, and a fertility decrease for every period reached in the game to signal the worsening climate :
WAR (They made ready for war) : 395-400 AD
This era is the prologue of this game. Fertility is at its normal value, you're introduced to the starting position of your and your neighbors factions, establish alliances (hopefully for the rest of the game, as the Imperium mechanic decreases your chances of getting any later on)), pillage the rich Roman cities for cash, or plain just develops and defend if you're far from Rome, or are Rome itself.
FAMINE (Darkness and Despair) : 400-420 AD
This era introduces you to the harsh reality that the world is changing and your starting province might not be the best to cling to after the fertility got down. This period will see players migrate en masse if they want to survive toward the rich fertility regions (Spain; Africa; Italy).
This period also sees the Huns grow from being a minor annoyance with three hordes to a growing problem. Huns will begin to actively takeover minors and devastate anything in their paths. While still not armed with the best units, their sheer numbers and horse archers make them hard to counter for the unprepared. Worse, the Huns cannot be destroyed until Attila is killed two times in battles, and Attila hasn't even grown to be general yet.
West Rome begins to fall apart during this time period usually.
DEATH (Abandon all hope) : 425-Basically until Attila kicks the bucket
This time period is what the game has been building up to. Tens of hordes of Huns move westward en masse, one led by Attila and a whole bunch of elite Hunnic cavalry and artillery that will smash any army not properly armed for the confrontation. East Rome will have a massive challenge trying to survive this period, and any Imperium you've built better have walls around each and every town, because otherwise only your large cities might remain in Legendary difficulty.
Killing Attila requires you to defeat him and wound him twice on the battlefield, after which the Huns will collapse under powerful debuffs. After the Hunnic Horde is destroyed, the world is basically yours to conquer. Knock yourself up, you've survived the Scourge of God, after all.

All in all, the campaign is fun times, even after you replay it.

SCORE
Overall I give this game a WARRIORS, EAGER FOR BLOOD! out of HEAVEN CAN WAIT, or in laymen's term, 9/10.

56,49586959,english,"For background, I have thousands of hours across the older TW titles, but haven't purchased one myself since Attila, which is roughly around the time I began to rapidly lose interest in the franchise and its practices. In fact, I was so dorked out on the originals that I would even carry a notepad on me, where I could write down my invasion plans for when I got home from school/work, whatever I was doing. 

One of my favorite things about the older titles was the well-written essay you could get by right-clicking on any of the units or buildings in the game. As a history buff, these older titles were true treasures in my life. I legitimately felt like I was becoming a better, wiser, more knowledgeable, and more analytical person from playing them. It felt like I was getting a substantial history lesson of the given period all while having a great time, which was a dream come true. 

Rome 2 was the beginning of the end. Granted, I have 500+ hours in it, but from the start it was a buggy, un-optimized mess. When they eventually released the Emperor Edition overhaul I noticed a tremendous change in the AI, for the worse. The AI stopped playing by the game's own rules, imposing artificial difficulty into everything you did, and I'm almost certain cheating in the process. They tried to pass it off as 'balance', when in reality, just like in the real world, the country with the most money just happens to dominate much of the landscape. Example of the artificial difficulty: the card says some terrible event has a 1% probability of occurring, yet it fires every 3-4 turns like clockwork? I'm no mathematician, but isn't that a statistical impossibility?

In the past few titles and beginning with the release of Attila, it just feels like I'm that guy mindlessly sitting at a slot machine in Reno, where the house always has the upper hand, but lets you have just enough of a taste to keep you dumping money in. It's just so mindless now. Everything I considered beautiful about this series has been stripped out, and with no hope in sight of it ever returning until they get rid of their executives and start over. I'm sure I can speak for all of us when I say that we would prefer updated versions of old titles using the exact same mechanics. Just think, Medieval 2 or Empire more or less in their exact form, only with fully up to date graphics, and some new historical battles thrown in...

57,49581615,english,"I purchased this game because I was told it would be superior to total war Rome in every way. It is not at all. Personally I would call it the worst total war to date.

[b]Pros:[/b]
The UI is better than in previous total wars. Displaying things better places and such.

Factions are somewhat more balanced compared to Rome. (Ignoring the extremely broke white Huns)

[b]Cons:[/b]
Cities are extremely hard to satisfy making it much easier to just raise everything you come across.

Attila will always come around and ruin your game. Attila is playing a totally different game where he can escape defeat, have free armies, hide without a good way to find him and of course seemingly teleport around the map.

If you like battles that are not sieges bad news because now almost all battles are sieges. Waiting a town out takes around 12 turns 8 to start starving them. 

Towers in sieges have become insane powerful. In addition, any nation with stone towers make them explode upon capture killing the unit capturing it.

Archers have now become nightmares always running away from your armies this is both horse and normal archers. Trust me this will bring some fun battles.

Campaign is honestly boring just “survive” what a achievement.

Hordes are a nuisance if you are against them absolutely impossible to find. Play a horde and watch the AI enable its radar system chasing you across the world.

58,49567513,english,"I just sunk another 80 hours into RTW and RTW:BI and loved them so I thought I'd give some of the post-MTWII games another go. I want to like the later Total War games so much, but I can't stand the region system, the HUD design is Byzantine and ugly, there's no way to game the AI to crush enemies even on the easiest settings (which I enjoy), the character pop-ups are hideous and confusing, the building system is trashy garbage, all of the fun historical information about units is totally hidden and peripheral rather than being an integral part of the game. Even the fonts are terrible. On and on it goes.

Sure the battles are gorgeous, but the thing that made the earlier games good to me was that, in addition to fun battles,  they ALSO integrated enjoyable RPG elements (""Oh, no My general has become a catamite/raging alcoholic/looney tunes!"" rather than this dull, homogenous +/-% icon crap) , the city management was fun (the city actually opened up when I clicked on it rather than being this cruddy little box of icons at the bottom of the screen that hasn't changed through 5 games), and the map felt visible, rather than cluttered (it's a MAP, guys, come on! I don't need to see every tree, let's see the forest through the trees). 

Now the people are gone, the feeling of grand geography is gone, the feeling of specific cities is gone. The obsession with photo-realistic trees and proper unit movement on 3D terrain has completely obliterated any sense of good design and left no room for imagination. In the earlier games battles were a last resort, when I couldn't trust my AI general to wipe out 2600 Lombards with 150 horses--now they're basically the only thing that's left. You've got it all wrong.

I will never buy another Total War game until you go back to the roots of a well-rounded, uniquely rich world that crosses over between different genres (It used to be Civ+StarCraft with a splash of Final Fantasy and some wacky, enjoyable history lessons).

62,49484392,english,"After several years and 400+ hours I suppose its fair to give a review.

This game is to Rome 2 what Napoleon was to Empire: A separate game that is basically an expansion/conversion of the original. A key difference between this and Rome 2, however, is that campaign plays significantly differently. Especially if you are playing as a roman faction, it is a weird blend of a survival game and grand strategy, as you fight off invading barbarians, infighting allies and the climate itself. Playing as Western Rome is a genuine challenge! I prefer to play as one of the smaller factions and build my way up, and some factions have very cool and historically relevant perks that differentiate them. My favorite are the Ostrogoths, who can recruit roman units from captured roman cities (the ostrogoths would go on to rule italy for a few hundred years!). When Attila shows up the Huns are a formidable challenge (Hun units are ridiculously OP in all troop categories, including heavy infantry, which is not exactly a hallmark of steppe nomads), and you have to kill Attila himself a few times before he actually dies and the hordes dissipate. If the huns come to your part of the map, expect an epic couple of turns. It is also possible to play as a faction that never encounters the huns due to map position - the Persians, for instance, get off scott free.

To touch on the battles, it terms of concept and controls it's the same as Rome 2, but the stats under the hood are quite different. Cavalry is extremely OP in this game vs. Rome 2, in part owning to historical reasons (the invention of the stirrup, for one thing) but mostly due to statistical spam. A low-tier scout cavalry unit with barely any attack or armor will still devastate most infantry, even in a frontal charge, because of the ridiculous amount of health and mass given to the horses. I get that cavalry was an important and dominant force, but it's too much. [In the course of its continual updates, CA decided it would be cool to give a certain Alani cav unit a charge bonus of zero, perhaps to reduce this effect, but that doesn't make any sense!] 

Meanwhile most infantry units have rather low attack values - Roman infantry is particularly weak, adding to the challenge factor!  - thereby putting a higher emphasis on armor and combined arms effectiveness. There is more emphasis on special troop formations to increase their unit's mass to counter the effects of incoming charges, which raises the stakes for troop positioning and battlefield selection. In a certain respect this is an improvement over some dynamics you'd see in Rome 2, where a few OP infantry units could mow down an entire enemy army if given the chance to do so. In Attila you need a more balanced army.

I'll save my hard criticism for the game engine. This game is TERRIBLY optimized. Most TW titles have their issues but this one chugs on a machine that can flawlessly handle Rome 2 at max settings at 60fps. They don't look that different! There should not be such a gap in performance. Also the lighting in Attila is sometimes broken - especially when you are in or near city walls! At this point, don't expect any fixes. It's been 4 years.

Overall I appreciated my time with this game. If you see it on sale I recommend you check it out if you're up for a total war experience with a different take on the campaign.

The visuals are nasty, as despite technically having the same graphics as R2 they ruin it with a horrible dark orange filter and various overly dark daytime weather effects. While the aim of this is to create a foreboding apocalyptic atmosphere it just ends up looking like someone messed up the color schema. There isn't much variation in the way of unit appearances either. 

Now for the worst aspect of this game, the cities/settlements (or more accurately the lack thereof). Much of the beauty of R2 was its various unique and detailed, cities. The scale and layout of the various metropolis was a joy to play through and sieges where undoubtedly the highlight of the game. Attila is massive downgrade in this regard as it uses the same generic wooden structures/tents for most population centers, and merely reutilizes a handful of the same stone models for the major cities from R2 (only showing them in a decomposed form in order to be ''historically accurate'' and fit the ''atmosphere'' ect.). One could be forgiven for thinking that the developers used the era the game as an excuse to downgrade. In short, the whole thing stinks of a cynical cashgrab. Another zero effort project running off R2s frame that became successful through a massive ad campaign, connections to the gaming journalism cartel, rigged Youtube algorithms and innumerable fake reviews purchased from established PR firms (who hold a great many Steam accounts).

Thankfully there is a solution ie. the modding community. Download and install the 1220 medieval wars overhaul. Its essentially Medieval 3, with a plethora of impressive new unit models, revamped cities/castle forts and even its own soundtrack. The gameplay and campaign dynamics are also improved. Weather your establishing papal supremacy in Saxony or retaking Constantinopol is truly is a joy to play. The guys who produced it (in their spare time for free) deserve a massive pat on the back. They suprassed what the devs over at creative assembly where paid to do and should be working on the next TW imo. 

Unfortunately however the franchise seems to be in a downward spiral. The focus has drifted away from large scale projects and steady improvement towards the sporadic regurgitation of old material through rebranding techniques. Little originality has emerged since R2 or Shogun 2. The new Three Kingdoms game (which had massive potential on a conceptual level) looks to be little more than a cheap remix of Shugun2, just as Attila was a cheap remix of R2. This trend towards cashgrabs is also reflected in the constant stream of low quality DLC that we see emerging (much of which is inferior to the work of the modding community in the workshop).

+ Very good music. Overall sound is so good I'd say it's easily one of the best in TW series. 
+ It runs pretty well in comparison with TW WH on gtx 1080. I never had more than 60, and most of the time less than 40 in WH series, and Rome 2 worked pretty underwhelming on high-end cards due to 2gb vram limit. This game runs on 4gb vram and is well optimized now, so I can have strong 50 in the most bloody city assaults with the entire map burning. 
+ It has a ton of cool mechanics (even revolutionary for the series, I'd say) on strategic map, like sanitation, climate change ect. It's a worthy addition to the game and I hope it will stay in further titles. 
+ It might be the best vanilla temp of battle I’ve seen since Med2 (set aside WH series, it’s whole another deal). It’s fast, but allows a plenty of room for maneuvers and strategy, no units seem owning too much. Though it’s debatable as 100% mounted armies of Huns and pikemen do deliver insane amounts of pain, they are very counterable with enough of skill and patience to sacrifice your best troops for a decisive victory (which Imho is pretty realistic). 
+Imperial campaigns are a very interesting experience, that’s quite different to what you’d feel in any other TW game. It’s the only time in Total War when you start as a late game steamroll machine and go deeper and deeper in meat grinder. WRE campaign is insane, ERE is somewhat calmer, but is quite far from boring as well. There’s no such thing as it was in Rome 2 when you’d just build several legions in your calm Italian corner and rectify the entire world with them 150 years BC. Now you have deal with deadly threats every turn, and the incoming hordes give you little space to breathe. For example, with prices only slightly higher than these in Rome 2, you’ll spend 10k at least and it would hardly provide for the basic survival. 
+ Carlmagne campaign is a very decent experience. It is pretty much a title in a title. 
- Dlc nations are crap. Most barbaric rosters are too similar, and northern roster is just a joke. That’s a HUGE – to CA.
- Graphics are fine, but no particular progress since Rome 2. Fire is cool though
- Ai is easy to stuck and gets extremely dumb. It works all right when it’s doesn’t bug, though. 
- Hordes are not as fun as I’d wish. They are mostly: sit until a date and then go rekt Rome.

3 Must take a roman town to obtain a city. (AS i have been told to abandon my towns) Roman town 20 time stronger. So impossible to take. Cant raise a bigger army because there is no food or money to raise a bigger army! WTF!
4 Stupid units that go round the map to get behind the walls even thought I control the ****ing gate Im telling them to go through!!! 
5 Beyond irritating narrator. Who wont shut the **** up!
6 Cross the Danube and the Huns wont follow you. So cross the Danube and... the ****ing Huns follow me with their 5 maxed out armies.
7 When I attack a town it has full garrison. Then my town gets attacked garrison is sitting at about 15% always!

9 I hate that in the start up menu it is telling me that my drivers are out of date. They are NOT!!! 
10 Tried playing the main campaign. Got my two armies to Britain both landed then turn after turn they are stuck in the same position. Try and move both in normal stance ""it is impossible to do that"" Forced march "" it is impossible to do that, ambush ""it is impossible too do that. So now my armies are stuck. AARRGHHH!!
11 Archers of all types are USELESS they do absolutely no damage what so ever. 
12 First battle on main campaign (now playing easy) 16 troops can't even kill ONE enemy troop! The are just standing around doing nothing. Click attack nothing. 5 troops of archers shooting nothing. 16 troops killed zero enemy. Total BS.

Total War: ATILLA is a game developed by The Creative Assembly and published by SEGA and forms part of the Total War series

The game offers some pleasant graphics and really vibrant colours, although some ugly glitches here and there, it is pleasant all the same

The game does suffer with some repetitiveness at certain areas of the game but a fun game nonetheless

Total War: ATILLA overall, however, is a fun game to play, yet sometimes flawed, but is a great grand strategy game to play in short bursts!

This is a great game! Not perfect and maybe not even my favourite game in the Total War series (Medieval II and Napoleon are also in my top three). There is more emphasis on domestic management in this game, both in keeping finances balanced through city management, and making sure your family had enough influence to keep other nobles loyal through dynastic management. In order to build high level units cities have to be upgraded to high levels which is an expensive and time consuming endever, but almost essential to have late game. Religion plays a major role and converting new cities can sometimes be more problems than its worth. 

When it comes to the battles, they are solid but the balance for auto battles is sometimes off (in my opinion). If you like other Total War games I think you will like this game. I ended up loving this one and it is solidly in my list of my top three favourite TW games.

As the sequel to Rome II, it shares a lot of gameplay mechanics and features with its predecessor. Some improvements have been made, notably regarding family and loyalty management which isn't as frustrating as in Rome II.

The biggest difference for me, however, is the overall feel and difficulty of the game. Rome II looks nice and friendly and plays nice and friendly. It's only difficult at the very beginning, after that, it's a piece of cake.

Attila has this constant feeling of impending doom and devastation that comes with CA's interpretation of Late Antiquity (admittedly debatable). But it's good for the game. The difficulty is much, much higher and - depending on your faction - can last into the endgame due to the ever-respawning huns, the famines and massive immigration and religious difference penalties. This, of course, is especially true for the Western Roman Empire, which was the most fun challenge for me by far. That being sad, I thin I don't remember a single time I ever had to worry about public order in Rome II.

So if you liked Rome II but thought it was too easy and tame, try out Attila.

1.) The game does not even work.  There is a problem with the lancher.  Meaning if you buy the game you wont be able to play out of the box since the 2018 update.  The new lancher was intended to show all total war titles so you could buy more.   But it has problems deep in the code and will stop the game from even lanching on steam unless you have other titles.  There is no one even fixing the problem with 100's of reviews with the same issue, for over a year.  You can fix it but get ready for hours of troubleshooting on your own.  In a nutshell it explains all CA problems in the last 20 years.  Focusing on how to monetize their games at the expense of quality and gameplay depth, innovation and now even usability.

2.)  CA flagging negative reviews to try to get them removed.  (You can see screenshots of other steam users, their comment and that the developers of total war marked it as abbusive, on several occasions, look it up its for real.)  It couldn't be a problem with you and your games direction, it must be a problem your customers and that racist white male. who just doesn't seem to like women in the games is how you acted.   Its the way you handled the situation.  The way every single game is half finished and half working on release (you know it is) with the rest being locked.  You want to play as all factions, you have to pay, you want to see blood, cough up a $1.99.  You want the game to work upon purchase any time in the last year, sorry our new monitization lancher messed that up.  But, if you want women generals and characters that look like they could be any race, we've definitely been working on that.  The company spends more time social justice warrioring, removing negative reviews as abbusive that are clearly not and figuring out more ways to monetize their games than make good games anymore, and its getting worse.

3.) The game felt rushed to put together (and was) and felt unfinished, let alone not working out of the box for over a year.

I would not buy this game again obviously.  I will also not buy anything else from creative studios or total war anymore, at least until things in the company.

It took me years to actually ease into this game and now in the year of our lord 2018 I have finished the grand campaign as the Western Roman Empire.

I hated the infinite stacks of tier 1 units from the Huns coming from the east. 
Until I learned to love the immersion. 
I realized a VIDEO GAME is making me stressed out from the threat of demons coming from nowhere. 

That is historically accurate in terms of fear of horse archers coming from the unknown steppe.

The ancient peoples felt the same except for real so like their gods abandoned them when the Scythians, Huns, Mongols etc. rolled around from nowhere creating mountains of bones and devastating entire regions that never recover.

With that mindset I took to the game in a colder calculated approach abandoning entire regions and retreating back to Italy. I cared little for the ""barbarians"" and less so for the rebels. I sold men by the thousands. 
I abandoned catholicism altogether and let the gods free for all under my pragmatic eyes. Let the dominant religion claim victor without bloodshed, let the real god reign I say. It matters little for the impending doom for any after life will undoubtedly have no room for any more lives when the horse arrives.

Suffice to say I clacked up some legions and held my forts against impossible odds time and time again. I even staged an offensive and reclaimed the iberian peninsula, gaul, and brittania. 
At some point in the game I only had rebels and the huns to deal with which was hilarious because that's when Atilla spawned and I spanked his bottom like a naughty little boy. I spanked his bottom red yes I did. 

There is little a horde of horse archers can do against artillery, and crossbowmen that hide behind the spearmen. It's a tried and true tactic that.

but what disturbs me the most so far is, the taxes are controlled for the whole fraction, not for provinces or cities, but food is controlled only for every province and it seems you can't even shift this around. Meaning, rebuilding a ruin leaves you with negative food and thus, negative public order and you can't counter this with taxes properly, because you'd loose your taxes in other provices as well...
That's just plain BS.

I also dislike the whole campaign concept... tried the prolog and did what they told me, left the game with ~-90 public order, -20 food.. building more food production increases poverty, which you have to counter with sanitarity, but there are almost no buidlings for that...

Then I tried an easy campaign with the longbears, it was considered ""easy"". You start with 2 people liking you, but refusing any diplomacy with you. It's said, you should fight the vandals, which may give you a chance to form an alliance with the franks or allemanns, but yea, they are behind the allemanns border, and you're not allowed to pass it, genius.
You got no food income, and no real enemy at that point (which is probably the easy part).
Most buildings (at least beginning at lv2) increase negative stats, but you don't have any building to counter those, which mens you can't even improve. 
I then fought someone else, and conquered their city, it was in the same province as mine and I could produce food there, so yay, for that. I later accepted the peace treaty for some gold, and they plundered my province, because, they can do it?
Now, two or three 'enemy' armies are walking through my territory as they wish, and I can't start a fight with them, because they all have a defensive alliance with another fraction.

what's next is, you start out with Tier 0 soldiers, weak health, weak armor, half of them weak armor piercing or low arrow blocking. Some enemies start with Tier 1 soldiers who beat all my soldiers... I though the best start would be to get 2-3 of each different soldier, to have some varity, but I had a fight, where almost all of them had no chance against most of the enemies soldier, who also had a variety in his army.


I loved Shogun 2 and I'd like Warhammer 1 if it weren't for those stupid ""random stuff happening(playing as a dwarf, you get random objectives like ""fight fraction x"" and this fraction is on the other side of the map..., playing as chaos, was fun, until that commander of Tzeentch spawned in the middle of the norscan area, with an additional army for each of my own) and 2, if those campaigns objectives wouldn't be so big (mortal empire: conquering I think 140/295 settlements)

4,47797238,english,"At release this game was like a massive patch to Rome 2. The campaign gameplay is probably the best in any total war game since it features a fully fleshed out city management and politics system. No idea why they completely scrapped it in the warhammer games. The battles are ruined by cavalry, which is both very powerful in this game and spammed by the AI, turning many battles into blobfests where my cavalry blob fights their cavalry blob. Graphics are great however they're only marginally better than those in Rome 2 yet require twice the GPU power.

Campaign Pros:
-Best campaign mechanics in a total war to date. 
-City management is fun and varied especially compared to the warhammer games. Coming back from those it was especially refreshing to have options other than a generic money building or generic public order building. 
-Politics is fully fledged out. 
Campaign Cons: 
-Razing mechanics and the approach of a mini ice age turn the map into a nuclear wasteland by midgame complete with a nuclear winter. The razing burning animation even looks a little like a nuclear fire.

Battle Pros:
-Infantry fights are slower paced and you actually have time for maneuvers. 
-AI is competent. 
Battle Cons:
-Cavalry is ridiculously OP, where any unbraced infantry unit will take 50% casualties in 10 seconds from a cavalry charge. 
-AI builds armies that are 50+% cavalry and 30% skirmishers. This turns the line of battle into the dots of battle since AI armies frequently have just 2 melee infantry units. 

Other:
-Music is underwhelming consisting of barebone instrumentals and tribal chants.
-Graphics are pretty.
-The burning of towns during sieges and the landscape being set on fire by incendiary weapons is cool.
-Setting is arguably less interesting than classical antiquity. That said it tackles a frequently ignored period of history so the novelty is definitely a plus.",1545715990,1545715990,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197989283232,53,2,18009,0,17161.0,1577844439,,

Expansion is harsh since corruption punishes you severely, and there is no freedom in building cities, as you always end up building the same shit in every single town.

Balancing military might with money and food to keep your populace from starving is challenging enough at times, but factor the constant threat of an invincible Mongol horde, and you will truly learn to fear The Scourge of God.

The game takes place during the fall of Rome. The Roman empire has split into two different factions, and is beset on all sides by Barbarian kingdoms laying siege to their ancestral lands, punishing the imperial Romans for their complacency and decadence. The Sassanid Empire has risen in the East, reclaiming territories in Persia and Arabia. Above all, however, comes a far worse threat: a mobile horde of savage foreigners, looting, raping, and pillaging everywhere they go, deadset on a collision course with Rome itself. Playing as either of these major empires is difficult enough, but one of the most terrifying experiences is playing as one of these smaller tribes, just trying to survive in a world that seems to be ending. The snows of the north move further south, alongside many competing tribes. The sun is blotted out of the sky, and there are whispers of death on the wind, fortelling the arrival of a man who will set the very foundation of the mountains ablaze.

There is nothing else out there quite like the terrifying desperation one feels in simply trying to survive. You'll make alliancess with former enemies who are much stronger than you; hell, you may become a tributary of theirs, out of sheer desperation. You will abandon allies to superior enemies, and send in armies to put down citizens rioting due to starvation.

Running the benchmark using Nvidias optimized settings gives me an FPS that varies between a 80 fps and 23 fps with an average of 45, if it was a consistent 45 the game would be playable at least but instead it jumps betweem like 25 and 60 fps. Turning settings down to medium yields a more consistent FPS during actual gameplay and honestly at medium settings it sits between 55 and 60 during actual gameplay most of the time however there are still significant frame drops. Moreover I ran the same tests less than a month ago and the only thing that changed between my PC then and now is a driver update for my graphics card.

18,47597778,english,"Hey everyone!

So I will get right into it;

I began my journey in Rome and I was stunned by the concept. Back then the AI was, let me put this mildly, TERRIBLE, but the game was just so enjoyable that you didn't care. The balance was also not great, 1 squad of spartans could butcher thousands of peasants. But the map was large, controlling those large armies was amazing and crushing your foes made you feel like a god. Needless to say, I became hooked. 
Since then I've played them all, every Total War game that came out and I loved them all. But it was Medieval who held the crown of being the best. It was the undisputed grand strategy king in my books. 

Then came Attila and boy.... Medieval got the same treatment Oberyn got from The Mountain in Game of Thrones. At first I was unsure about it but after getting into it, it blew me away. Don't misunderstand me here, Medieval will always hold a place in my heart but over the years the game mechanics have evolved, the AI has gotten better and the balance has been tweaked. 

I have had no problems with performance in this game, although I'm running it on a mediocre gaming rig. It has very, very rarely crashed on me or froze and the FPS has been pretty stable throughout all my playthroughs. 

What I love most about Attila is probably the setting, it is the closest thing to Medieval times since, well, Medieval (especially if you have the Age of Charlemagne dlc). But overall I think it is a great mix of the old games and the new. The gameplay is still pretty much the same, the map is familiar but it's mostly the new features that carry it beyond Medieval. I am a big fan of the Province system which wasn't existant in the old games. The diplomacy works a lot better and like I previously said, the AI has gotten better. 

So in my opinion, this is currently the king of the Total War games. Of course there are people who would argue that other games are better but I believe there is a factor of personal preference included. I for one did not like Empire nor Napoleon and I wasn't big on Rome 2 either. --Please note that I am NOT comparing it to the Warhammer versions--

So that being said, all Total War games are buggy, none of them has a GREAT AI and while I don't agree with the DLC cash grab policy they got going, it seems that pretty much all game developers have gone down that road nowadays (Paradox, Relic, Wildcard and Bethesda to name a few). 

So if you are new to this genre and are looking at the copies and can't decide, I would recommend you consider what time period wanna play, as that will suit you the most. All of them are great in their own right and all of them are flawed too.

Supid AI factions that don't even colonised razed cities 4. could be extremely tough if playing as Western Rome or the Huns 5. hasn't been updated for long, leaving a huge space to improve.

But I can't get enough of Attila. Not since my first days of playing TW:M2 have I found myself losing track of hours upon hours, thinking ... just a few more turns.

With a more reliable diplomatic system, a nicely complicated building tree, and the ability to raid, sack, loot, or raze neighbors, the strategic depth of empire building in this game is definately the best in the franchise (and yes, I've played them all). I particularly enjoyed the fact that some empire-special-abilites drastically change not only combat, but how to optimally expand and fight. 

Family/political management and proper province building (for agents & troop rosters) have a bit of a learning curve, but are realy engaging once understood. The slow freezing of the world, and the addition of migration/horde mechanics really puts this game in a league of its own compared to other TW games.

Once you've gotten a grip on the new systems, if the game feels a little rushed to you, I strongly recommend picking up (at least) 2 mods:  12 turns per year, & x2 research cost. With these mods, the size of the map, and the veritable horde of factions, the game verges into almost grand strategy gameplay.

If you feel like Total War has lost some of it's magic over the years, and if (like me) you skipped this title because of Rome 2's lackluster release, you should give Attila a chance.

I am playing Total war games for a really long time now.

78,21240507,english,"First of all:

In my opinion Attila should never have been a stand alone full price title. Instead, it should have been an stand alone expansion to Rome 2, and many of it's ""new"" features and improvements(family tree, better UI, politics, etc) should have been integrated into the core game(Rome 2).
This is exactly the same thing CA did with Empire and Napoleon back in the days... Created a buggy, clustered and non-optimised game(Empire) and in stead of improve it they just decided to release Napoleon shortly after, a game that is basically a re-skin of Empire with a cleaner UI and less bugs.
To add salt to the injury, they keep releasing those unpopular ""Blood and Gore DLCs"" as well as ""Faction Packs""(got to say that those are at least better than selling individual factions or Unit Packs like they did before)...


With that said however:

As much as i am displeased with CA and SEGA for their past mistakes and bad business practices, i have to say that Attila is actually quite a good Total War game, and looks like a step(several) in the right direction again, with new features such as a political system, a more fleshed out Horde Mode for several factions, and even the brand new ability to completely raze settlements to the ground.
Attila also ditched most of the bad things about Rome 2(terrible UI, magical abilities for units, among others), while at the same time took those features that were good(or that had the abiility to be) and made them better. The return of things like ""several turns per year"" and ""family tree"" are also very welcomed.

With some further patching and improvements and some further mod support, Attila could be on par with Shogun 2 and Napoleon in its level of quality, polishing and narrative.

Worth buying for both old and new fans alike of the Total War series,
Of all its DLCs however, the only one i would truly recommend its Age of Charlemagne, the rest can be easily skipped.

PS: While the vanilla game is quite good, i do have a few gripes with it and feel there is room for improvement.

In Attila, as you raze cities to the ground or gradually wear down your opponent's hordes with desperate rearguard actions, the conflicts feel more personal.

17,23376477,english,"I thouroughly enjoyed total war attila. There are several mechanism that have been deployed in this game.

Horde mechanism

Some factions own no territoty : they are called hordes factions. Playing a horde is a cat and mouse game. Some time you are the mouse and some time the cat. An horde can be easily crushed if left alone. Thereforce, you have to planned ahead. I usually send my spies ahead to spot enemy armies. My heroes also protects my hordes from ennemy agents. I like also sadistic pleasure you take when razing a province. Early game you don't earn a lot of money. So you really have to decide how what to build.  Horde armies as any armies gain tradition. As you do a lot of fight with hordes you will have lot of tradition: you army will move faster, grow faster lower enemy moral ... You have also a feeling of freedom with hordes. You don't have to defend territories. You go wherver you want and terrorize whoever you want. It's a great experience.

Diplomacy

Diplomacy has been extended compared to rome total war. You have a trend to know if will increase or decrease. You can really play a diplomacy game where you support your allies. As allies territories count in victory condition, you can win without owning much by using smart alliances. 

Playing the roman empire

My first game was with the roman empire. First thirty-fourty turns are of humiliciation. You cannot win and have to decide where to hold ground and develop your economy. You sufer so much from start game than it's really a huge pleasure later on to crush the armies which have humiliated you and restore roman empire. A new mechanism named immigration adds to the difficulty. Whenever a province is sacked or razed, people flee to other neighbouring provinces. It adds public order penalty. It kicks in around turn thirty when you have stabilized your border. So after attacks from everywhere you have instability whitin your own empire. Every turn from turn 1, you have that feeling : I cannot hold. 

The offices

Family tree is back and politics has been enhanced. You can assign an office to the different member of state. It's important as some office may really help to manage a town or an armee. You have to pay attention to loyalty of the different people. Stricter control of country leads to better incomes and a malus to public order. Loose control means less income and a bonus to public order. You have to equilabrate your power based on your income and level of public order.

37,45758850,english,"Having over 900 hours on my last account and it playing for the past 3 years. It's time that I write a review for this game.

To start off, I bought this game when it released on feburary 17th 2015 and to be quite honest it's still my absolute favorite game. Anyone who hasn't played a Total war title, well this might be a good start if you're looking to enter on the foundation of historical accuracy and ""Real Time Strategy"". The campaign is set in The game begins in 395 AD, during what is now called Late Antiquity (the transition period from Classical Rome to the Medieval age in European history). While the title character will be able to become the leader of the Huns, he is not yet in power at the start of the campaign. Upon the death of Emperor Theodosius I in 395 AD, the empire is divided between his sons who each rule a half: Honorius in the West, and Arcadius in the East. Rome is divided. In the west, The Western Roman Empire Faces a barbarian riposte from the north. To the east, the Eastern Roman Empire boarders the Sassanid Empire. Playing as a Roman faction, it will quickly become a game of survival as Rome's legions are stretched to breaking point to protect a decaying empire. About a quarter of the way through the campaign, Attila the Hun comes of age, and with this Hunnic forces begin to rise in the northeastern portion of the map. Now, the choice is yours to either get on good terms with this man as he will be a thorn in your side for the douration of the game if you declare war (Especially early in the campaign as Roman).

Ah, now we get to actual gameplay... It's fantastic, The Campaign the multiplayer battles... It's overwhelming at times but that is the point of a total war game, especially if you take to multiplayer. The modding community for this game is still alive and well. And this might just be your go to title if you're a fan of Lord of the Rings, because a complete overhaul is just around the corner (Rise of Mordor). As well as numerous other overhauls set in multiple time periods, This game has become the centerpiece of multiple overhauls. This includes Medival Kingdoms 1212ad, Aincent Empires, Rise of Mordor, Attila 1220 and the list just goes on. Also don't forget the hundreds of units mods!

I can't really express how lovely the community is here and we welcome all those who wish to be a  pat of it, And how thankful we are for the devoted small teams of people making overhauls and detailed changes to this day for a game nearing 4 years old. If you enjoy massive ground and naval battles with detailed infantry and units, spectacular sieges and micro management.

that mobile settlement has a unique chain of buildings with positive and negative effects.

50,45048109,english,"A bit of an improvement on Rome II - but sadly not enough of an improvement. The interface is bizarre and not at all obvious or intuitive, just like Rome II.  There are some mods that make it worth playing. And the Last Roman campaign is quite good fun and more of a challenge than usual at the start (enemy armies full of high quality heavy cavalry better than yours) until it becomes boring and repetitive too. It is a DLC and you have to pay for it though.

As with Rome II the graphics are decent and the battles are ok, but unfortunately the campaign is full of faults that make it unsatisfying to play and in my case usually just end up giving up and turning the game off. Not because i couldn't win - i win a lot of battles (the battle AI isn't that great, though decent by Total war standards), but because basic features that should be in the game are missing (especially proper diplomacy).

Some improvement on Rome II in that you can build walls on any settlement, but still, for no good reason, only once they become a level 4 settlement. 

Most ancient settlements bigger than a village had walls - because it would have been too dangerous not to have any. And since Total War maps are only showing a tiny minority of the actual towns and cities that existed (because on that map scale you couldn't have them all in) any that are in should be major towns or cities - and have walls from the start. British Isles would be one of the few exceptions - and by the dark ages even many of its towns had walls.

Armies being able to embark on transports instantly isn't as historically inaccurate for this period as for Rome II - but it should be restricted to certain factions (Angles, Saxons etc) and unfortunately it's not. There's a mod for this but it doesn't seem to work (maybe not updated as they require updates after every new DLC and every patch).

As with Rome II you can only set one tax level to apply to every single settlement in your kingdom or empire. This is both needlessly annoying and historically inaccurate.

Diplomacy is the weakest point of the game. Without mods the only time anyone you're at war with will make peace is if you're on the point of wiping them out. The biggest problem though, as in Rome II, is being unable to trade regions. There is one mod that attempts to fix this but in practice at the moment all that allows is to offer a horde or enemy army in your territory a region that they are in at the time. And they generally say no. And the other mods that might make them reasonable enough to say yes are not compatible with the mods that allow region trading in diplomacy.

This is even worse for Attila than it was for Rome II, because if you are playing as Western or Eastern Romans, you are constantly invaded by barbarian hordes - and you can't do what the Roman Empire did historically, which was to offer them land on the empire's borders in return for defending those borders as vassals/ allies. You can, if they're not at war with you at the time, and if you have a general and army in the same region they're in at the time, recruit 1 or 2 units per turn from a horde, but that's not really the same thing.",1538435241,1540756760,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,4,True,False,False,76561198030916207,73,18,7044,0,6930,1540585645,,

First of all, I love this game. I love it because its different. The game is not easy thats for sure but then it depends what faction you play. I started of with one of the Northan tribes (The Saxons) and sure it was tough going, especially considering your surrounded by strong factions. I wouild recommend playing one of the African factions as you can very easily and quickly expand your terratory against weak Roman occupation of towns and cities. This does allow you to master the new style of play were you can play Romans but they are not the primary faction, there is no primary faction which adds to the interesting change this game offers.

The game engine is roughly the same as Rome 2 on the campaign map, but battle map feels like a return to Shogun 2 although there are still some Rome 2 elements, I welcome the minor changes as the combat is more fluid now.

There is a random bug were every now and then the game crashes to desktop. Annoying? Yes, but considering the autosave function, getting back into game take you back to were you finished off.

I give this game a solid 8 out of 10, there is a tough learning curve which won't suit a lot of people and the bug looses points, but other than that, this is a solid game.",1540246233,1540246233,True,2,0,0.527231454849243164,0,True,False,False,76561197981780917,219,22,952,0,952,1540493849,,

96,45014662,english,"In Attila TW, you can either play as a wandering horde faction or a traditional ""start with 1 province/city and conquer the world from there"" faction. While I welcome the new horde mechanic, bear in mind that unless this is your cup of tea, you'd likely prefer to just play one of the factions with a traditional start.

Overall, campaign map gameplay was way better in the earlier TW titles including Rome 1, Medieval 2 and Shogun 2. In Rome 1 for example, you had to decide whether to turn your settlement into a huge city or military recruitment center. Recruitment draws manpower from your population, so if you recruit too frequently, your population won't grow fast enough to progress to the next tier upgrade. But if you delay recruitment too long, your enemies might exploit this and attack early. By placing generals in cities, you can send slaves to that city from other parts of the empire to speed up its growth towards the next tier upgrade, but also need to balance the disorder that comes with a huge population by investing in happiness improvements. This is a brilliant and deep risk-reward mechanic that encouraged strategic thought and precise timing. In Shogun 2, your generals have a highly developed skill upgrade tree available and by constructing the right combination of buildings in each province, you can create powerful synergies to enhance your unit abilities. Such campaign mechanics have been dumbed down since Rome 2. Here, you just have to max out growth and rush research to reach the next tier and automatically unlock new improvements. Apart from certain advanced units that require specific resources, the entire campaign is just spam economic improvements, build up armies and conquer the world. While that's the ultimate objective, how you get there is just as important. 

Despite the addition of the horde mechanic and like in Rome 2, Attila lacks strategic campaign management where you feel like a governor as much as a general, which was typical in the earlier TW titles. An immersive campaign experience is just as important as spectacular real time battles. This is supposedly still a strategy game but its strategic layer is shallow. I won't comment on the WH TW series as I haven't played it, but as far as the historical titles are concerned, such campaign gameplay degradation has continued to this day. Unless TW goes back to its roots and brings back immersive campaign mechanics like those examples mentioned earlier, it seems the historical series will only go downhill from here. And I've not even touched on hefty price tags and controversial dlc practices.

I'm aware of the recent backlash from female generals and some dev remark in Rome 2, but see it as just the straw that broke the camel's back. Imho, it's not about female generals or even the remark per se but the fact that the TW series has since Rome 2 continuously denied players the one thing that made TW truly great, which was its mix of immersive campaign gameplay and real time battles. Yet instead of correcting this, the series since Rome 2 has focused on pricing and dlc practices hostile to players. Unless the series gets back on the right path, any future releases won't be worth wasting your time on regardless of all these ""distractions"".

Another thing is this game is poorly optimized even though I more than meet the recommended requirements.

I was really clueless how the game mechanics worked and didnt even understand that you needed a general to recruit troops. But everyone is noob at new games they play. This game has alot of potential thanks to modders who can create almost a new game (Ancient empires and 1212ad for example). The vanilla game is really fun once you get in to it and I have spent countless evenings and nights playing it. I love total war games but if you play to much it get repetitive and boring (Almost as all games). The really downside is that this game is badly optimized, I have trouble having a steady fps for most battles with more than 2 stacks of armies. So you really need a monster PC or downgrade the graphics. I also hate that CA milking money from dlcs.  I mean you even needed to buy a blood dlc to get blood and gore. (There is a mod for free). Without the faction dlcs there is just a handful factions you can play as so that sucks. 
Once you have taken over a few provinces I get bored really fast, for me the game lacks mid and late game content. The start of a campaign is the most funny part when you decide where to settle as a horde or how your playstyle will be. If you get this game prepare for a lagfest and to download mods because you will need it to enjoy. 1212ad will be out soon and its that mod Im waiting for because medieval war is my cup of tea.

20,45037190,english,"CA have reached a new low. I've played thousands of hours on other TW games and this is the pits. It doesn't even pretend not to cheat. Even on Easy, I cannot win battles and I've normally [play on Hard or Very Hard. I lose almost every one-on-one when enemy troops are no better than mine.  My morale is always the first to go. Unless I isolate and surround a unit I can't win and even then casualties are pyrrhic so it's pointless. I could win against RTW2 most of the time even when outnumbered. This game makes it impossible unless you have overwhelming odds.

The campaign game is equally munted. Sieges last forever so encircling and waiting for surrender is not a viable option. Playing Saxons on easy, I was wiped out in 10 turns. This should not be possible. What's the point of 'Easy' level difficult if you cannot survive 10 tuirns?

As for the tutorial, it has to be the worst in any game ever. A tutorial where you are guaranteed to lose is a sick joke. It's set up to make you fail at every turn. I have gathered that it's to force you to make a Horde but it feels like you've lost and who is going to play a game where you feel like you've lost the tutorial. It's nuts. Even in the early part of the campaign, it forces your regions to be starving and and have negative public order. WTF? 

As for the help system, it's virtually useless even more so than RTW2 which was bad enough. It is almost impossible to work out from your tech trree what troops you will be able to recruit. It's fine if the tech itself unlocks them but if the tech unlocks a building which may or may not unlock troop types you're in for a 5 minute hunt to find out what. Not only that, you can no longer even see what your troop capabilities are from the recruitment screen. It gives only a general idea and not the actual details which you have to use the help system for so comparing troop capabilities is utterly impractical.

Do not buy this game unless you enjoy being annoyed, angry, frustrated and screamiong at your computer. After about 10 hours of playing I can safely say I didn't enjoy one minute of it. I tried, God knbows I tried, but this game was completely resistant to my effort. If Steam had a fair refund policy, I'd demand a refund.

Optimize: 
I read some one said it is not optimized. I too have short pauses during the fights with large armies. But I fixed them by using ""Process Lasso"" a free program you can search for on Google. Then using the Process Lasso I freed up one core and it's hyper thread buddy. Core 0 and 1 - leaving them for Windows programs. Short pauses stopped. There is a video on YouTube for X-Plane how to do that. Use the same process. I like the ""Aero Sim Gaming"" how to vid as it seems least annoying and straight forward.

70,44997108,english,"Total War: ATTILA.

That says about it, really. This isn't about the shogunate in Japan, this isn't about Rome. This is about the scourge of God, the crumbling Roman Empire, and the survivors in the East creating a Graeco-Roman hybrid that would continue to exist for nearly a thousand years longer.

ATTILA is truly apocalyptic. Nomadic tribes begin their westward migration, taking advantage of the Roman Empires' poor infastructure and lack of unity. Refugees flood Romes borders, her armies stretched too far.

It is impossible, when playing ATTILA, to not feel a sense of coming dread. The diluted colour palette and brutal warfare shows us that, truly, there is no hope. 

Should you play as a pre-established power, you cannot win every war. This isn't ""Total War"". This is ""Total Survival"". You must abandon provinces. Playing as the Western Romans, I was forced to abandon all regions bar Britannia, Hispania and Italia. 

And I barely managed to hold those too against the rising power of the Saxons, Alamans, Alans, etc.



The entire Total War franchise has been about painting the map your colour. For myself, and many other players, the joy is in the start - you play as a weak faction with tough rivals, through superior tactics you defeat them, but then you just snowball. The game gets boring. Sometimes CA will throw events at you to keep you on your toes - like Realm Divide in Shogun 2, or the Norman Invasion in Thrones of Britannia, but by then, you're so powerful.

ATTILA doesn't have an easy start, unless you're the Sassanids, and if you're playing Sassanids, get out of here.

This review is for real SPQR boys.

The early game as Western Rome is so brutal. There's no ""Defeat this one rival then snowball"" scenarios like there is in Shogun 2 (Play as Oda, defeat Tokugawa and Imagawa, snowball, gg ez). 

Instead you ARE the powerhouse, and you ARE a paper-tiger. You are weak. You can barely sustain two armies at this point, and you've dozens of provinces to defend. You will lose land. You will have riots and revolutions, religious anarchy as constant refugees flood your borders, and as your ally, the Eastern Romans get battered by Sassanids and White Huns, you will realize that your dreams of a Pax Romana are impossible, and that you must survive, reinforce your core, then, and only then, might you stand a chance when Attila comes.


Attila is the most brutal Total War experience. 
I've watched helplessly as countless legions are cut down by hunnic lancers. 
I've watched as testudos are shattered by war elephants. 
I've watched as the Eastern Romans shattered our bonds and used my weakness to annex my Balkan holdings.


Yet the Empire has endured. And that is the ultimate goal of Total War: ATTILA. To endure, to survive.


Once, or if, you beat the game as the Western Roman Empire, there's no challenge left. You did the impossible. 

Sure, you could play Huns and raid into Europe, destroying her cities and pillaging, but to me, there's far more joy in defending from an unstoppable horde than there is being a horde.

I believe CA is really doing a lot in order to improve the strategic map gameplay in each of their games, adding a level of depth and immersion that is highly appreciated. There's still a long way to go in order to match the grand strategic complexity of Paradox games, but they are manging to craft something unique. The maps are huge and gorgeous, full of small little details.
The tactical aspect in the batttles is just amazing, and manages to gracefully combine realism with arcade fun. You will have the chance to deal with epic battles in total uncertainty, and enjoy the late antiquity and high middle ages slaughterhouse unfold in slow motion.

Playing the main campaign with the Western Roman Empire for the first time is brutal. You feel the weight of centuries of slow decline upon your shoulders, while you try to delay the inevitable by all means. It's not just the barbarian pressure on the borders, it is also the internal turmoil, corruption and religious strife are rotting you from within. By far the most fun and mind consuming defeat I've ever had in a Strategy game. Loved it.

Of course the game has a lot of details and stuff that can be improved, but the workshop has plenty of stuff that can satisfy that. Personally, I prefer the game with less AI cheating, the spawning of hordes and hordes of Huns, can be monotonous, annoying and unrealistic at a certain point.

59,44899176,english,"***To start off I recommend this game because I want to capture the attention of a gamer who is on the edge of buying it and I want to discuss the game and not the company. It is interesting how so many people review this game without talking about the game itself. Look I am well aware that CA and Sega have been making really dumb choices with every title that comes out but boycotting their old games that already came out years ago is wasted effort. Boycott the new ones so they will feel the affect where it hurts them the most; their wallets.

So for the actual game how is it? Weellll... its not great but its not garbage entirely. I'll break up my thoughts in 3 ideas, Campaign, general Issues, and final thought

Campaign is a mix bag of good and bad. The most fun in the campaign is early game like turns 1-100. You will have great moments, epic battles, great defense and seiges, wars will wage and all that is fun. I really like how many factions you can play as in the GRand Campaign and how different each one is. You can be a subjegated nation and that will be vastly different than playing as the Romans, then playing as a horde is very different than a settled faction. There is great replayability with all the factions having different mechanics working for them. Of course late game its all the same. Trying to build and maintain your empire is balanced enough so that you can focus on wars and battles without having to worry about the state of your empire constantly. However the worst most broken and frustrating aspect about the campaign is the agent system, by god this is the worst. When youre at war with a nation they will spam the hell out of the priest agent, this agent can disrupt armies and cause dissent in towns but what is so broken is that the enemy's agents are flawless. They will get critical successes every single time, it is a mad stroke of luck if they fail their task. But what is so broken is that once they get a success then they level up and then makes it easier for them to succeed and again then they level up again then succeed more. Eventually every priest agent is insanely OP and what is so game breaking is your agents are worthless. I cant ever get a single agent past level 3 due to some stupid critical failure. Every agent i recuit gets killed by a critical failure, never had an agent die from an assassination. I absolutely hate this agent system and CA never improves on it. Warhammer had the exact same problems.

So what other problems are there? Well the most broken aspects show in the custom battles. Well the main issue is that the game engine is not optomized for todays standards. I dont know how the game got release like this. If you do a custom battle with more than 2 armies, the game will lag to about a frame a second and Im using a 1080 card. During the campaign however I never had that issue even when I had massive 4 army battles the lag was never as strong as it is in custom battles. I dont know how it is exactly in multiplayer, I dont play multiplayer, but from what i've seen from youtube is that is it isnt as bad as a custom map but still exists. Then the AI is absolutely stupid. Again in custom battle its the worst and campaign isnt as bad but its still obvious. If you do a siege the AI will throw everything at you and at one section. Sometimes the AI will try to flank with cav but 90% of the time the AI will cluster in one choke point and you will most likely win a battle even horribly out numbered since when in a cluster the men can all break together. The AI for a custom siege battle with walls is 100% broken dont even try it. The AI will run back and forth outside the walls (which doesnt help the poor engine's frame rate at all) and wont ever use the siege equipment, the units drop the stuff to run around outside of the walls its absolutely pathetic and inexcusable that the game got pushed through play testing with such an obvious flaw.

So final thought; I put i recommend only because I want to reach the gamer who like strategy war games and let them know what exactly they are getting into. When I look at reviews for any game, if its done by a big corporation people just rag on the company which is understandable; personally I will never buy an EA or Activision game because I dont tollerate their business practices but honestly CA isnt forcing mircotransaction in this game, the DLC isnt completely nessicary like most games are now (I mean there is way to many and culture packs should be friggin free and paying for blood and gore is the most heinous DLC but you dont need them at all.) and bottom line it is a fun game and there are tons of mods to try.

***So i recommend strictly if it is on sale, and if you have fun with real time battles and grand strategy games. There is still a good amount of people playing online if that is your thing too. Its fun but how much fun you'll get out of it thats up to you and your play style. Just do not buy it full priced.
Its funny to recommend this after all the flaws and problems i have with it but what makes this game fun still is the community. While CA has clearly abondoned this game the modders are picking up the slack, with mods like MK 1212AD and Rise of Mordor and Anceint Empires and some overhauls you can tailor the game to your liking. You can and will have fun if you want to.

60,44898375,english,"I really love what CA has recently done, but this title is by far the most frustrating I have ever played with. I chose to give it a bad review for just one, basic reason: hordes are the worst factions to play with, which is paradoxical, since the game is litterlly named ATTILA.  Don't get me wrong, the armies they can field are incredible, yet the games's flaws ruin the experience in one simple way: agent spam. There are THOUSANDS of posts in forums that address this issue, but apparently the developers prefer leaving it as it is and letting the modders fix it. I think that being uncapable of moving across the map without an handicap of 60-85% at every turn is a big deal. My game experience with the White Huns has been ruined by the agents of three different factions that were constantly blocking my army until 3 armies came at me and crushed me. I have played with other factions and it is still manageable, it's like playing Rome 2, but playing as an horde faction puts you in a position in which mobility and swiftness are key to survive. Counter-spamming and fleeing is not fun or smart, it is just the result of bad game design.

66,44758521,english,"As you can see I have played this game a little bit. I have played as nearly every faction and have had alot of fun. Just like with any new total war game it took me some play time to get used to the differences that come with new total war games. I hate, as well as most people do, how much DLCs are waved in our faces instead of just being added to the game. I bought every DLC for this game because I liked it so much and I bought them during sales so I got them for 1/2 to 3/4 the original price. It got a little crazy paying .75 cents for blood and gore, but none the less I did it because it was something I wanted.

PROS: Campaign is fun for most factions and features somewhat different units accross the board. You get into some redundancy in certain areas like Northern Europe, Eurasia, North Africa and the Middle East. I know some people disliked the unlimited death stacks of Huns that flood Europe, but I kinda liked the challenge they gave especially on higher difficuluties they are damn near impossible unless you have a large amount of troops to send to the HUN MeatGrinder.

PRO: I really love the family tree and positions that they can attain. I really enjoyed having that back into the game after Rome 2. 

PRO: I also enjoyed having a playable game that I can actually enjoy and spend time on because Rome 2 was literally unplayable on both my desktop and laptop and that seriously bothered me.

PRO: The technology tree and diplomancy is alot better in my opinion when compared to older total war games. But some factions will completely hate you and refuse any sort of diplomacy at the smallest level, but for the most part I like it.

CONS: Having characters with low loyalty and the only way to raise it is to cut their balls off (thus not spreading their genes in the family tree) or blinding them. Both causing severe negative traits gained.

CONS: The diplomacy aspect where everyone absolutly hates you past a certain Imperium stage gained.

CONS: Constant diplomatic nagging from factions every single turn.

CONS: Corruption in towns/cities/provinces that render income basically useless. This is alot more prevelant when playing as Western Rome when corruption gets huge.

69,44751365,english,"I'm trying to like Attila; I've liked all the other Total War games, but this is the first one I'm going to have to thumbs down.  First and foremost, this is a hog, it seems to run slower than Rome II.  My PC is fairly old, (My PC was top of the line 5 years ago) but I run this on lowest settings (even though it recommends higher for my computer).  Furthermore, it crashes ALL THE TIME.  It is so frustrating having to go through the slow loading of the campaign over and over again every time it crashes.  Then once you get deep in the campaign it eventually hits a point where it crashes every time you reload.  I can go back 4 or 5 turns- but then when I get to that point again it crashes again.

I've never had any Total War game crash so often.  Occassionally, yes, but not all the time.

Difficulty is much higher than other Total War games- but not in a good way.  You have to spend all your time dealing with keeping people happy rather than... well waging war.  Growing food- makes people unhappy.  WTF?  Why is it that every food improvement makes people unhappy. ""Oh NOES! Farmer Joe is growing wheat... that makes me sad. I hate wheat fields""

Instead of Total War it should be ""Total Sadness: ATTILA"" because you spend most of your effort trying to keep people happy not fighting.  The balance of this games just seems off. This appears to be a very rushed and poorly tested or thought out addition to the Total War Franchise. This game isn't a battle and conquest simulator- it's just a tedious make people happy (or unhappy) simulator.  Why is my empire unhappy all the time? Is it because the citizens hate existing on the worst of the Total War series?

The migration mechanics are more annoying than they are fun or immersive.  There really arn't any good upgrades from this game over the others- everything seems to be a change for the worse.

Save your frustrations... buy Rome II instead.  If you already have Rome II - skip this one, it doesn't add any improvements, it just makes things worse.

71,44737255,english,"Total War, what criticism is left to level at this once groundbreaking developer? I've been with them since the very beginning when the Demo (remember those?) to Shogun came out. I remember how challenging it was at first to figure out their rock paper scissors approach to tactical battles and how satisfying it was to beat opponents more powerful once I did. But that was 18 years ago. Sure, their games now look better, but instead of investing in the Battle and Campaign AI, Diplomacy, Economy, faction management, etc., they went down the dead end of graphics. It's a dead end because with such scale they'll never equal the visual relish of console games and because their fanbase, strategy players and history aficionados, doesn't care about special effects (if they did they'd go for the many better looking console titles). 

They want substance. 

That, however, is severely lacking in Total War games in general. As for this title specifically, Attila is a really good idea for a period piece as major changes were about to hit the western world. Western Roman Empire would be torn apart by the invading Germanic tribes, while the Eastern half would eventually rise to unprecedented heights under the reign of Justinian. Why they went for climatic change that happens mid game and degrades fertility? Not sure. So far my readings on the late antiquity stemming from the research done over the preceding decades paint a picture of a vibrant world, not one, as so often is described, in decline. Sure, there are many changes brought about in government, culture, religion, but this did not necessitate a decline. There's several historical misfires that are built into the game (Churches draining Imperial treasury, division of Goths into Eastern and Western at the start date and having them at War with Romans as some sort of a horde, absence of serious usurpations, which the Emperors treated with more urgency than barbarian incursions, etc.) correction of which would improve the game balance (the phrase we so often hear from CA as they serve up another round of gruel) and add to its sophistication.

If Paradox, CA's most serious competitor, has shown anything it's how elegant sophistication in strategy games can be. Diplomacy, faction interaction, AI, is much better in Paradox games, offering a greater degree of control. It seems they have a better understanding of this niche market than CA. And with Imperator coming out next year, I hope this part of history will receive a generous treatment, it deserves.

It looked promising, as a total war fan I was really hoping that the campaign map would be expanded and detailed, the modding capabilities made as rich as seen in Shogun 2, and the new army doctrine mechanics alleviate the thirst for a total war that finally doesnt suck.
Boy oh boy was I wrong.

I didnt buy Rome 2 because it was a jumbled mess of a game that took literally 4 years to be good (by ""good"" I mean standard total war quality with minor improvements)  and I still refuse to buy it to this day because the price is outrageous for it's ""quality"" and CA should be ashamed of having conceived it in the first place, with the disastrous launch and PR debacles following their frankly ridiculous DLC practices.
This one, I waited and tried to like it, because it looked like an improved version, but it is broken to a fundamental level just like its predecessor. For one, the engine is poorly optimized: I have a GTX 1060, i76700k, and it slows down at times of mild action, in a way that never before made me so angry. Barely 30 fps in a forest? Yeah no thanks. And how about the autogenerated terrain, which has holes in it? Yes, literal holes inside the maps. I once walked my army on a hill only to find it split open like cheese with a big glowing white void inside. Floating buildings are still a problem. No moddability whatsoever, as a matter of fact the tools for us modders are barely working and dont do anything specific other than the usual pre-Shogun2 era, or even less. Of courese they're still in beta and will be like that forever because CA moves on very fast as soon as the next title comes out.

This is a promising title created on an abortion of an engine (Warscape) which has plagued the series since Empire with bugs, freezes, stuttering, countless sound issues - there is a looping sound problem that was NEVER FIXED from Empire!! after 7 years!! - and very poorly managed overall, with mildly boring campaign and lackluster presentation for a game of this type, it looks like they tried to replicate Napoleon: Total War's success but failed to realize what NTW really has in comparison: a soul put into it, and arguably a much better AI composition for both campaign and battle maps, which is saying something seeing as this AI is probably the third worst in the series overall (after Rome2 and Empire).

A battle that would normally be an easy victory in any other total war game, becomes a one sided slaughter with no hope. the balance of this game is completely out of whack.

cav charges does minimal damage and archers have neglegtable effects. after a battle with my archers shooting 50% of their ammo against unarmored, unshielded targets they had 4 and 8 kills respectively. the enemy archer squads were no different with 8-15 kills.

it seamingly only boils down to who has the best infantry. with cav and archers doing minimal damage, a infantry heavy army is unstoppable unless you face them with similar infantry. that leads to honestly boring strategies and that is not an experience i seek from a total war game. 

with a total war game, i expect to win an unfavorable match if i outsmart the oponent, be that with practical ranged support or with smart use of cavalry. and mind you i see a victory not only as getting the victory popup, but also in case i manage to deal crippling damage against an expensive army with a cheap army, despite getting the defeat screen.",1536419098,1536419098,False,0,1,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False,76561198010141992,386,9,1348,0,841,1598984854,,

84,44608034,english,"well... if you read the other review, you might find this similar...
-First, cheat AI... look like they don't pay any upkeep to maintain their army... I play as huns, and I raze and sack around... there was a country with 4 provinces with 3-4 full stack of army in each province. How that possible? And I am not in the late game. I am in the early stage of the game... I kill them and sack them, but their money seem to be unlimit. They build their army back in a couple of turn.
When I play any faction, it is hard to balance between order, money, and many full stack of army... you basically focus one at a time and slowly build that up... OH!, you also need to worry about food. 
-Second, comparing with Total war shogun 2, Attila agent are pretty useless. The only useful one is the champion that give your army exp every turn. The other is not as useful as in shogun because attital AI cheat, so it doesn't matter if you slowdown anything or increase their corruction or anything... that doesn't impact them at all. But if they do that to you, and your have negative order, you are in truble.
-The assassination from the scout is really bad. Even your agent is full update in assassination and high level, you fail as often as you are a 1 star agent. And they get wounded very easily.
-Influence... if you don't have enough influence, and they give you a bad wife, too bad. You have to take it. (maybe kill her late).
-Where the hell they get that many bastars children?
-in shogun 2, I can use my agent to ""distract"" or stop the enemy army, so I can target one or two of their army at a time. But here, forget it. They ally couple of country and all come at you. And look like they don't receive any terrain penaty, they will get you and cath you pretty fast. When 3-5 full stack army are near, you are done. 
-The diplomacy is really dump. You are sieging thier last province? let begin to offer a white peace deal. Seriouesly? In shogun 2, at least they offer couple thousand of coins, and if I refuse, they will offer more. Oh!, but sometime they declare war on you out of the blue, because you just ""saw"" a tiny corner of their province (with you meet them) after many turn, and you are not in war with their ally or anything...
-Accuracy... I see that it is from 0 to 3 (or maybe somewhere a 4?)... what does this mean? can you put that in a % and on a scale of 0%-100% ??... my cav has 2 and some of my archer has 2 also, and the cav missed alsmot all of their shot every single time.

The first thing you'll notice is that converting a level 1 city costs ~4-10x more than previous games. Converting itself takes ~10 turns. Even after disabling the show AI moves option, the AI takes 2-5 minutes every turn. Yes, it takes real life HOURS to convert a single city.

But it gets worse, because a full stack of 20 isn't quite sufficient to maintain order in a small, unconverted settlement. So you need to fund a full army to sit on its ass while you try saving up 17k to convert the town. Don't worry, the army comes in handy when the settlement inevitably goes into revolt every other turn. Then you discover it's cheaper and faster to abandon the town and rebuild it! Phenomenal.

So you're finally getting the hang of it. So what if the Huns are further west than they ever went even before Attila's born? So what if your faction has no units to counter horse archers until late tier III techs have been researched? Make up for it with micro and numbers.

But then the year 420 hits. The game creators watched one too many shows on HBO, and decided an eternal winter should descend upon Europe! Your food production drops by several hundred. You put all of your money into upgrading food sources. But the winter accelerates, and you fall even further behind!

Although game gets better after 4-5 hours, it can't generate the enough momentum to keep you ongoing.

One last thing for soundtracks, I admire the musics in Total War series but this game made me dissappointed on that. Although Middle Asian themed musics are cool, there are no musics of other cultures in soundtracks and it doesn't make much sense to play a pagan nordic tribe with hun music.

37,43712766,english,"One of the best  Total War games hands down.

This game tells the tale of the Late Classical period circa 395-500 AD, a time when the conventional Roman-dominated world came to an end. The great thing about this game, and any total war game for that matter, is you get to decide how the history of your world unfolds compared to the historical record.

In my first play through I of course played as the Western Roman Empire on hard and damn does this game offer a challenge. Your armies are stretched thin, your economy is falling apart, rebellions are near constant, political infighting abounds, and to top it off, you are constantly invaded by barbarian tribes and the fearsome huns. 

My first encounter with the huns went something like this: "" Oh hey they have an army in my territory, I have an army too, I better go fight them in the field to push them out of my lands. Ok got every one lined up, spearmen in the front, a few archers, don't really need cavalry. Oh shit all they have are horse archers, wow they are strong, oh crap all my men are dying before they can attack them. That's ok...oh shit all my men are routing. What the fuck just happened????"" 

This is not an easy game. This game does not play favorites. In the end, most factions are going to have to fight the huns, and they (and the Sassinids) are no joke. Also the climate is constantly changing, disease is breaking out in settlements every few turns, allies are scarce, many territories are devastated beyond recognition by rampaging armies, and battles really do have a life and death feel to them. I can't describe the highs of absolutely destroying the Huns as the WRE with row after row of archers or the lows of seeing your best army get routed by stack after stack of reinforcing Sassinid battalions. It's an experience you shouldn't miss. For instance, when I started to expand again as the WRE into what was Germany, I might as well have been on the moon. Region after region, town after town, building after building, civilization after civilization destroyed by ravaging armies. There was little glory but definitely a sense of duty towards saving what was left of Roman civilization from the barbarians.

In fact if anything this Total feels more personal than most. You really feel like you are trying to preserve (or destroy) civilization from its worst impulses. When your meager settlement has run out of food, troops are deserting, and you have to make a quick capture of a nearby city or else you are toast-- this is the essence of Total War: Attila. The game honestly really made me think about what it was like to be some poor Roman soldier in 450 fighting the Hunnic hordes, what was going through their mind. What about the countless civilians who were probably butchered for no reason, the families torn apart, the dreams of a docile life shattered. Any game that can make such an impression is definitely special. 

There are some negatives however. To be honest in the Vanilla game, the Huns are completely OP, ESPECIALLY against the AI. They run roughshod over just about everybody except the Sassinids (who will be busy kicking your ass as often as possible too). Most of the map looks like a desert wasteland in a short time, which takes some of the glory of conquest. Also, the unrest/food/disease mechanic is a constant hassle. On the higher difficulties territories will constantly rebel unless you are some sort of Total War Legend who knows how to expertly balance the economy, sanitation, food supply, and public order. This makes the game frustrating at times and hinders your growth as an empire. I wonder however, if the developers wanted it this way and DIDN'T want you to be too successful too quick as to emphasize the gravity of the historical situation.

Either way the game is fabulous with a few flaws. One of the best Total War games and a definite improvement over Total War: Rome 2 in many ways. Buy it!

-Graphics are crisper (requires more PC grunt though, so much grunt required!). 
-Unit cards make more sense
-Battle AI improved greatly. Watch out if you leave a unit vulnerable!
-Battle Pacing improved greatly over Rome2 at release. Its probably around Rome2 patched speeds but units seem to move around faster.
-Campaign AI needs some tuning but it is quite good. No more catching the AI in foreced march all the time.
-Family tree fully fleshed out!
-Tech tree simplified and all on one screen
-Events list now lets you handle events one at a time instead of having to remember what happened where!

Negatives/Bugs noticed so far:
Campaign AI sometimes decides to chase you until the ends of the map if you are a horde. Makes playing the Huns very difficult and quite frankly, a grinding bore.

51,25585897,english,"Good, if your rig is up to the task.

After 400 hours I think I can give a review.

IMO its not the best Total War, but it is a strong contender for 3rd or 4th place. 
The problems of Rome II are fixed, the campaign, all the events, climate change and marauding hordes, feel dynamic and are quite challenging. As always the game starts getting good only had difficulties hard or higher, but that is to be expected. The experience is much more like playing a survival game than a typical total war title.

The rosters are generally thematic, but varied, even though the rosters of some Germanic factions fall a little flat in diversity and distinctiveness. Instead, play style, starting positions and specializations (like the Naval Supremacy of the Vandals) influence and partially dictate your play style. The Eastern, Nomadic and Roman factions do not suffer from any sort of limited rosters and feel distinct from each other, as well as prior factions of earlier Total War games. In the end you will adjust the rosters with mods anyway, so it does not matter all that much.

The Migrating factions really are an amazing addition. 

The Huns specifically are menacing, but they behave very differently from the Mongols of TWM2. Instead of basically being a natural disaster, they start more like a band of bandits and and ruffians and as they accumulate wealth and have 6 to 10 elite fullstacks around the map they become a real threat to even the most developed empires.

Desolation is also a pretty great mechanic, however it should be adjusted with a resettling/ colonization mod, since otherwise whole swaths of the map remain empty until the end of the game. Which is interesting for some time, however it heavily favours the huns and white huns while other barbarians will die-off pretty quickly if the Romes don't fall.

The unit-balancing is fine, but cavalry seems a little to strong (which is ""historically"" accurate at least), missiles are very deadly, which is fine and adds a lot of momentum to the battles. Naval battles are actually very fun now and the Naval factions of the game are extremely fun to play. Instead of overloading every ship with an insane amount of commands they are now split into range-, ramming- and boardingships, so that even the AI knows what to do.

The modding scene has been very active, so that basically if you like the scenario and can run the base game, you will be able to adjust for all the major problems.

However, the game runs better than Rome II, at least for me, but still you will need a pretty strong machine to run it. Many people have complained about performance issues, I can imagine that is a problem of NVIDIA cards.

##A long word on Horsearchers##
Sure the game is named after the Huns, but the Huns and White Huns are way too powerful in the campaign. Their late-game stacks of elite-cataphract horsearchers can only be beaten in very costly battles, which would be fine if they didn't spawn endlessly after the birth and until the death of  Attilla. You will get sick and tired of beating them back pretty quickly. I suggest nerfing them with mods if you feel they are too annoying after a while. Alternatively get a mod which increases missile block chance. 


Verdict: Total War fans, with the capabilities of running it, should give it a try. It is basically a remake of Barbarian Invasion. A lot of work went into it and I think it has paid off.",1474284842,1531765695,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198021938849,133,6,46058,0,32340,1584821458,,

It’s a marketing attribution tool that helps companies determine which of their adverts are most effective. It does this in a similar way to other analytics tools by using cookies to generate a unique token from device information, and comparing that with data taken from marketing campaigns and game activations. In this way, the companies that use it are able to see which adverts are more effective. You can find out more about Red Shell here: https://redshell.io/home

However, while Red Shell was only used to measure the effectiveness of our advertising, we saw that players were clearly concerned about it and that it would be difficult for us to entirely reassure everyone. As such, the implementation of Red Shell was removed from all Total War games that previously used it.

58,43487907,english,"I am personally really enjoying this game.

As you can see on my account, 'am kinda used to the Total War franchise. And honestly do not really understand why this game is not more plebiscited.

I love its ambience, graphisms, colors, effects and the soundtracks go smoothly along. Time flies.
A variety of possible style of campaign thanks to a large panel of factions, but also brand new opportunities like razing down cities (which honestly is perfect. Why bothering occupying a settlement you won't care about right now and that can potentially give birth to the worst insurrection you've ever seen ?).
Battles are great. My impression is that they rely much more on your tactic rather than units. Also you can order units to move in a REAL arc, not a succession of straight lines. Fabulous.
The interface is great, I never had to look for anything, everything can be found easily.

But the victory conditions that are a bit too ""big"" if you do not plan to spend dozens of hours on the same campaign.
It also means that you won't complete all the tech' trees before long.
Also, when 2/3 of Europe has been razed and that the few remaining factions do not altogether reach your military power, it's pretty boring.

Cav is the center of this opus, which is normal regarding the time period. But I assure you you can conquer 2/3 of the Mediterranean Sea without more than 1/4 of your armies as cav.

70,43352237,english,"I would recommend this game for players who liked Total War: Rome II. A first item that has improved is your faction screen. By introducing a family tree, faction management becomes much more interesting and rewarding. Controlling influence and loyalty is a main aspect of the game that is better worked out than in Rome II. Also city management has become more complex (in a good manner) by adding sanitation. Not only is it necessary to keep happiness in order but also sanitation. It makes region control more complex and more fun. A negative point hereby however is food management. In Attila it became necessary to manage food for every region. Thus making it impossible to create 'granaries' in fertile regions and exporting the food to capital regions. Although the game places itself in a time of extended autarky this mechanism is too restrictive. (But the changing fertility as the climate gets colder is challenging and fun). Battles have remained largely the same (only the unit cards have changed). Regarding the different factions, it is possible to have a large variety of mechanisms between different factions so every game is different. Each faction group has its own building chain plus per faction some special properties. The possibilities to play as marauding Huns burning cities, Western Romans defending the Empire, Slavs colonising and defending and Eastern Romans surviving and prospering,... makes it a very diverse game with ample possibilities. A negative point is however the 'Hun spawn' mechanism. How they migrate and why they declare war are quite intransparant and makes the game somewhat inpredictible and random at moments. The almost unstoppable Hunnic force can make a game either annoying (for the control freak) or exciting (for the challenge seeker).

Concern:  Again this fits well with common definations of spyware and its one of the most common uses for such software.  See http://www.bbc.co.uk/webwise/guides/about-spyware  as an example.  Red Shell is hidden 3rd party program that the user is not made aware of on installation.  The value of the data or what it is for has no bearing on this.  This also leaves unanswered the question of what Red Shell is capable of and if the third party handling it gathers any additional information that it does not share with its customer.  In an era of information leaks and data hacks this can be important and doubly so since this is software that piggy backs off a different installation.  Software installed without your knowledge is not the same as a cookie that you can block.

As such, the implementation of Red Shell was removed from all Total War games that previously used it.""

Concern: This shows a clear lack of respect for CA´s customers.  CA maintains that they did nothing wrong and puts the onus of the problem on customers being difficult to reassure rather then on the fact that CA should have sought consent for this information gathering.

83,43233118,english,"total war attila, is a rts game set during the time of the collapsing roman empire, and other tribes/kingdoms struggling for survival across medeteranian. this games is by far my personal favourite from all the series. The game has intersting perspective than other games, in that is not about total conquest but survival of your factions. the game does this especially well, and that each decision you make, has an outcome. when i played as the saxons, i migrated my tribe across europe and make decision in choosing my battles and finding a good place to settler, as each choice is a risk. The campaign is by far the best its been, and keeps it intersting with different factions, graphics had improve over rome 2, and the map of the medeteranian is wonderful to look at. the AI has improved a bit but some of the issues of moving or setting troops. the battles are still a charm and seeing armies duke it on the battle field makes it as im watching a movie. the soundtrack is beautiful, captivating. multiplayer has been the same and getting freinds over to play is fun. diplomacy has still kept its system as rome 2 and by far still needs more improvement. MODS has really intice me to keep playing, as its comunity has some really talented developers that change the taste for this game from total conversion, popular medieval custom battles, campaign, units, graphics etc are very welcome. overall in my opinion, this is by far a new experince from the other series, a unqie, fun and enjoyable game.

97,43057437,english,"This will be a long detailed review so if you want a quick summary, if you're looking for a strong, enjoyable, challenging game [i]buy this right now[/i]. If you're short on money wait for a sale, although this game is well worth the base price.

To start, I've been a dedicated Total War player for years, sinking hundreds of hours each into Empire, Shogun 2, Napoleon, Rome 2, and now Attila. In my opinion, this is the best and most graphically pleasing one I've played so far. Granted, I have a thousand+ dollar gaming laptop that can run everything on ultra smoothly. Anyways, here's my list.

[i]Pros[/i]
Attrition- Developers have really enhanced this feature. Attrition, whether it be cold, hot, food shortage, swamp, mountains, or deep/rough seas, can quickly deplete your armies. Want to siege a city in the winter? Make sure you're force is strong enough to stand losing generally 20-30 troops per turn. Attrition forces you to strategize how and when in the year you'll invade a faction.
Combat- Combat has been overhauled dramatically, even based off Rome 2, to have many factors that can sway the tide of battle. Mastering the effects of the enviroment, weather, morale, and fatigue can dramatically improve your strength but if you ignore it it can be devastating. Battles now feel challenging and require attention constantly.
Generals- Generals are an importance in this game. Most factions you start out with a decent amount of generals and then they rarely become available afterwards. Generals alone can turn the tide of battle. Lose a general in the very beginning of a battle due to archers or an extremely lucky onager shot? Your troops will instantly suffer a dramatic morale penalty and will most likely rout soon after combat gets intense. On the other hand, having a strong general on the front line can significantly boost your forces morale and can win you the battle.
Seiges and City/Town Defenses- There are now archer towers and barricades available in almost every siege on a city or town. Archer towers have a huge range available to shoot flaming arrows at enemy forces. While they are pretty inaccurate at long range, they can rack up kills up close. I've even gotten extremely lucky and had enemy generals shot down by a lucky hit. The enemy will also usually set towards destroying towers first before pushing into the city so they can buy you needed time to defend. Barricades are somewhat useful at blocking off a particular street or entry but can usually be destroyed decently quick but can offer a crucial defense point in setting up bottlenecks on narrow streets.

[i]Neutrals[/i]
Archer Towers- While I listed them above as pros, they can also be an annoyance. You have no control over the targets and they typically shoot at whoever is closest. As stated above, they can be inaccurate and I've had my own city squares set on fire by missed flaming arrows. I guess it just depends on your luck.
Unit Rosters- While some factions such as Rome, the Huns, and a few others have huge unit rosters, other factions can lack or share almost the exact same roster. In the beginning of a grand campaign in mainland Europe, most factions will pump out Legio or Cohors and you'll end up facing the exact same armies from different factions. This problem is fixed though by hundreds of highly rated mods on the steam workshop that can easily diversify your gameplay experience.
Culture/Religion- While the game is host to a variety of different faction cultures and religions, they can be rather bare boned. Unit rosters are typically influenced by the culture the faction holds and this can result in multiple factions having almost the same roster, expect for higher tier units. Religion and culture does encourage you to focus on spreading your religion to newly conquered regions to avoid low public order and potential rebellions which in my opinion is a good thing. Having to put thought into how to manage newly taken territories is a good thing but again, they can be rather bare boned.
Politics- This is a big issue for many players. The politics system is something that must be paid attention to to avoid civil wars and rebellions but it can be difficult to understand. I had mutliple playthroughs when I first started playing end in failure because I neglected and ignored the politics. On the other hand, once you understand the poltics system and how it works you can prosper and reign over your faction.

[i]Cons[/i]
Diplomacy- While the diplomacy system works well and is really detailed, this is more of a personal matters. I've had multiple times were I would ask a faction for a non-aggression pact and gift them thousands of dollars just for them to declare war a turn or two later. While faction traits are a thing and can predict how a treaty will work with them, they sometimes don't matter at all. I've had factions with ""Loyal"" and ""Trustworthy"" traits declare war on me a turn after entering into a non-aggression pact. It's an annoyance mostly but still a con for me. On the other hand, I've formed extremely strong friendships and treaties with factions that wouldn't dare betray me. It just depends on your experience I guess.

My cons list is rather short as I'm extremely fond of this game. While the base game is great, thousands of mods increase the games potential and easily makes it one of my favorite games ever. I would definitely recommend it to someone thats looking for a challenging, exciting, thought-provoking game.",1529988764,1529988764,True,7,0,0.566722512245178223,0,True,False,False,76561198064147342,53,3,34000,0,6476,1592959399,,

I still see glitches  and other nonsense that are echoes from Empire Total War a title from 2009.

It's not the most optimised game but it still looks beautiful on lower settings. I'm running an i5 3470s, 1 gig GTX750 and 8 gig of ram. The game recomended Quality settings. But I still had to turn off some features of that were resource hogs and others down to a mixture of quality, preformance and max performance settings.  I turned up the unit size to ultra with unit detail on quality settings and the gameplay is as smooth as in Rome 2 running at 1600x1200. Though  I did notice a slight slow down when zoomed in but that was in a foggy battlefield amongst some trees. Rest of the battle was ok but be prepared for performance dips at times.

So be warned you might have to adjust your settings rather than rely on the game to tell you what it can run. Like I said before it still looks good on lower settings.

It's Rome 2.25 

So I wouldn't say it's a massive improvement on Rome 2 or the best Total War ever made. It's just slightly differrent and just as enjoyable. This game is about defending or destroying empires rather than creating an empire as in Rome 2.

The enormous jump between the games left me feeling very confused and at first overwhelmed by the differences in the games. The difficulty of the game was ecspecially brutal and I had to restart the campaigns many time after I lost so many times. Yet this game is still one of my favorites I have ever played. The campaign really makes you feel that the world is falling apart around you as the Huns loot and raze settlements and the light of the Romans fade as barbarian kingdoms attack unrelentingly. But you have the ability to stop this and reform the Roman Empire to its glorious past. 

There are many positives: The family system within your faction means you will have to monitor your generals ad their influence lest a civil war starts, the climate change causes you to adjust and plan far ahead with food, the factions feel different with the Sassanids relying on a mix of archers, cavalry and some experimental units like naph throwers while the Romans rely on their elite infantry to win the day.

There ar of course negatives: The AI can be exploited as it is not the smartest and does not use great battle tactics. The public happiness of regions can be exploited by just building happiness buildings. Food prices for certain buildings such as barracks becomes outrageous when upgrading it fully.

10,42947246,english,"firstly i dont have that much time logged on this title. ill be compairing alot of my observations back to shogun 2 where ive logged well over 1000 hours. 

lets start with the biggest issue, the combat. units feel clunky in motion. animations look a bit odd. units can act pretty odd when attempting to deploy them in a road between buildings by which i mean you cant actually stretch them out to their full length to either side. no this isnt an issue of hitting building hitboxes because the units can be redeployed to either side of thier initial deployment in the same width. as i said, odd.

in compairison to shogun 2, archers are all but useless. switching your archer to flaming arrows and targeting a tower is laughable, i thought to burn down a defenders tower and spent the next 6 or 7 minutes overseeing the melee only to turn and see the tower was still at around 40% fire damage, and still standing after id won the melee. the target is the size of a small barn or a large shed, after over 5 minutes of lobbing flaming arrows how did these poor poor archers fail to set the thing ablaze? and yes their about that effective firing into a group of enemy infantry...

unit compositions are pretty confusing. in shogun 2 you have 3 grades of units, monks, samurai, and ashigaru each for melee swords, yaris, naginata, bows, and matchlocks. in attila, rome has access to around a dozen melee swordsmen alone. im left stunned and speachless at the true variety of units, im not sure if this is good or bad as variety is always great but its going to take you a heck of alot longer than the 7 hours i put into it to even begin to grasp what unit is used for what and how good they are or not. spears, axes, and pikes have similar issues depending on what faction you choose to run, a massive variety that isnt uniform at all across the board (not a bad thing). this lack of uniformity gives the feeling that your truely fighting different culturaly inspired armies and is nice, however the complexity means you probibly going to need to drop dozens and dozens of hours to learn the units from each factions and figure out their strengths and weaknesses in order to counter them.

unit size and movement felt off in attila. in shogun 2 units moved in perct military formation with clear rows and collums of men moving as one. in attila units dont look to be anywhere near that professional. they looks to be nother more than a gaggle of civilians armed and formed into a militia in order to defend their town/city. they dont move in crisp clean formations but instead move like a large gang of people grouping together in an organic churning mass of flesh. as a former service member i much prefer the dress right dress, military formationed march from shogun 2 to the maurading clump of men i saw in attila.

destructible walls and field army fort emplacements look amazing! im sorry to say i havent had the privelige to try them out yet, but can only sing their praises from what ive seen of videos. maybe when i check back in a few month in the hopes some of the unit deployment issues are resolved (or mods are made to address them) ill get the chance to try this stuff out first hand.

siege maps are AMAZING! the maps are both large and spaced out allowing you to deploy gigantic armies without fear of having to cram all of your units into the top level of the keep where theire basically standing on top of one anothers shoulders to fit. this also means that you will need large armies to actually cover all the potential avenues of approach in a siege defense so take care, 4-5 units are no longer going to be able to hold all the passes into your city/town.

diplomacy and government. alright this is one thats going to be fairly contriversal. i loved the new changes. they are incredibly intricate and complicated. yeah i know, not a great start. but in shogun 2 one of my biggest pet peeves was in the late game in or around realm divide everyone and their brother declares war on you and your fighting a half dozen real time battles per turn. so each turn ends up takings several hours real time in order to move onto the next and slows your overall strategy and goals way down to the point you feel your making no progress. the level of infrastructure and governmental management u can bring to bear in attila may help to offset the feeling of the endless war when you get more than a hand full of factions declaring war on you.

graphics look a bit wattered down by compairison to the shogun 2 units. when zoomed right down to ground level graphics look fine, but when zoomed out the textures get muted significantly and it looks like your men are wearing simply tan t-shirts. for the record im playing will all graphical settings at their highest. the meshes for the characters are much more varied and comprehensive in attila which is a nice pluss. but the textures used to color those meshes just arnt up to the same level. in shogun 2 the meshes were all uniform, and the textures fairly simple but also uniform. at range when the units seem to become a bit blurry its fine because your likely looking at one end of the line and seeing them in full detail and your mind will fill in the lost details at range. this isnt the case with attila since each individual in a unit will have vastley different clothing textures from the person beside them. while the meshes are largely the same the textures coloring them mean that when a unit is further back you cant tell what it should look like, and it throws off your immersion.

the campaign map has made both improvements and had a few shortcoming since shogun 2. since shogun the campaign map looks much higher in textural quality. the areas feel far more open and you dont feel quiet so confined to specific developed roads. however armies can be difficult to spot on the campaign map, by which i mean in shogun 2 if u scroll accross the map, its almost impossible to miss the avatar of the enemy general/foot soldier, and their giant freaking flag denoting the size of their army. often the flags colors stick out in stark contrast to the surrounding lands. this isnt the case in attila. in atilla, there is a simple small circular symbol where the factions symble sits inside. the outside design of the symbol designates how ""full"" the army is. the enemy armies avatar rides a small brown horse and many of the avatars ontop of the horses wore earth tone colors, making it very difficult to spot them as the screen wheeled by as you pan around your growing empire. care will need to be taken to actually scrutinize your territories to avoid missing an army that just sauntered in.

overall i think the game has alot of potential. from what ive read, watched and experienced the ai is much better in attila than it was in shogun 2. i really REALLY wish i could somehow port over that increased intelligence but..... well guess ill have to wait for shogun 3. diplomacy/government upgrades are great if you want something other than endless battles to manage and the feeling of actually managing an empire. unit compositions are incredibly oversaturated giving you many degrees of each type of soldier to choose from, and the campaign map is more open and far more pretty looking with the beutiful textures they used.

at the end of the day i can neither recommend nor stear yall away from this game. i didnt personally like it because of the unit behaviour in combat, the overly complex unit compositions, and the odd looking unit textures displayed in combat. however others may see these additional units as simply more content and freedom of choice allowing them to customize their armies swordsmen to exactly the specific stats they wanted. i would say in its current state the game is a little bellow average. 

if u still want to try it after read this by all means. hope you found this review informative and helpful.",1529710716,1529710716,False,39,3,0.624771475791931152,2,True,False,False,76561198021438425,98,10,468,0,452,1534570299,,

Campaign: This game has alot of different elements to consider such as the many factions and how the work. Let begin with non other than the Huns: They are nomads that use ALOT OF CAVALRY and the can only SACK OR RAZE a settlement to the ground so hard to fight against when you are the Roman Empires of Barbarian kingdoms. Next up none other than the Western Roman and The Eastern Roman Empires, These guys are hard o play as because you have a large empire to mange from Barbarian assaults To Attila the Hun attacking The western roman empire gets it hardest as all the settlement have low public order and you are being attacked from all sides. Next are two catagories: The Barbarian Kingdoms, The Great Migrators, You have (only counting base game factions) the Franks, Saxon, Visgoths, Ostrogoths, Vandals and, Alani or Alans. The barbarian kingdoms are at war with rome and they have many neighboring kingdoms around the like the Jutes which are masters of the seas and other smaller kingdoms but it geats easier to conquer and take more land as the Game progresses. The Migrators are the hard one of the 2 as the start out with no settlements to manage Exept your army is your settlment but you have to run aroun the 2 Empires or smaller kingdoms and you have to conquer and pillage until you find settlemnt to occupy, but this is where it gets hard as now you have more to mange and most of the time shaortly after taking the settlement it will revolt of you will be stretched to thin and will be defeated by other kingdoms. Battles and AoC, TLR: The battles are an improvment over Rome 2 and other recent games as they have a purpose and are fun to fight but unit selection for Barbarians is low mostly they have the same warriors. Age of Charlemange is a great Expansion for this game as it is different from base game completely as the nw kingdoms are all new and special in their own regards but it is the perfect expansion for this game. The other expansion is The Last Roman which adds a ton fo new features and the Roman expedition and how you can conquer for the eastern empire or make your own kingdom or the new Western empire and you have other factions like the Visigothic Kingdom, Ostrogothic Kingdom, Vandals, The Kingdom of the Franks.

Now that I have more time, I recently reinstalled Attila and I can say it is my absolute favorite of the series.  And that's saying something.  The setting is great, the mechanics are respectable, and the game is a challenge.  Yes, it is a pig on resources, so you're not going to get 60fps on the highest settings on even the most capable setup.  But that doesn't matter - the game doesn't need 60fps (or more) like other titles.  My i7-7700, GTX 1070, 32GB, and SDD gets me around 50fps on high quality.  More than enough to play without jarring frame drops.

Currently I am playing on normal difficulty as the Franks.  I thought I was the cat's ass, expanded too quickly, and just got decimated by the AI last night.  Even so, I gave up a few settlements, retreated the armies, and still have time to rebuild.  It felt good to angrily raze the abandoned settlements into desolate land.  I'm sure there will be consequences, but I don't care.  If I can't have it, no one can!  I like that about this game - you can lose ground and still feel like you have a chance.

If you're a fan of Total War and haven't played Attila yet, you're missing out.  I plan on putting a few hundred into this one, then checking out the Age of Charlemange as well as the Middle Earth mod that just came out.  It's a great game and is definitely worth the investment.

36,42437890,english,"Ok so I have just kind of started to write reviews mainly for just the Total War games because I only really play strategy on my PC and those games are mainly Total War just because I love playing TW. In my opinion there is just no other strategy game's out there to play that have the real time battles to control up tp 3,000 or even 10,000 man armies, and if there is it is not even close to the scope or mechanics of TW games. There are strategy games that definately do things better like in-depth city and settlement management with in-depth building chains and tech. But if you love strategy games because they force you to think out decisions and have a strategy of your own on how to win like myself then any Total War game will most definately peak your interest and give you hours and hours of fun. Now is ATTILA a good game to introduce yourself to the Total War franchise? And is worth the money? Is it a good game? Yes I do think Attila is a good game but definately lacks any real diversity in there units for each faction. After your first campaign play-thru you might start to find yourself geting boring with no real campaign mechanics that are special to that faction that you are playing as to make each play-thru something different. These TW games should have hundreds of hours of replay after the first campaign and Attila can get boring but the modding community for Attila has literally fixed the game into something much better then the vanilla campaign. I like the game but maybe i'm impartial because I just love CA because of the TW games I will pretty much buy any TW title they put out, it is a good game and as I mentioned with the Mods its a much funner one. You have Radious mods, Viking Age mod, All the reskins and overhauls  make the game fun as hell. I would definately get it on sale though I think the price is still at like 44$ but all the TW titles are on a crazy good sale right now. I have over 300 hours into the game so I can say for myself I give it a 6.5/10 with the mods easily 8/10 fo shooooo.

[olist]
[*]Family tree's return!
[*]Sanitation (how healthy/clean your city/province is)
[*]Fertility (how much food you can get in provinces, decreases over time)
[*]Hordes (Huns, Vandals, Goths)
[/olist]
[list]
[*]The family tree helps this game by making you care about your generals. I always have my king/prince in the main army, making me extra careful and therefore almost insuring I don't rush into battle, it's one of the best things about this game.
[*]At first the sanitation was kind of annoying, same for the fertility. Over time I started to like it, since it stopped the ""mow through the A.I"" type of conquest if only for a time. If you even cared about it, anyway.
[*]The hordes are basically like if you took a factions last territory in Rome 2, the difference lies in that the hordes have their own mobile camp and can also just burn anything in their way (any faction can but the hordes benefit more from it).

Total War: Attila is pretty much a nice standalone expansion of Rome 2, tt has some nice expansions and seems like the perfect game to have mods changing the time-period both back and forth in time. Except for that though? Not much else.

I originally gave Attila an [b]8/10[/b], that was 2 years ago when literally anything seemed better than the train-wreck that was Rome 2.
Now though, I can't help but find Attila lacking in almost every aspect.

Graphics: Looks very good, especially if you have a good pc.
Gameplay: Pretty standard melee Total War. Unit collision is not very good though, large line battles quickly turn unto blob moshpits, can ruin the experience sometimes.
Story: There's not really a story.
Bugs/Glitches: I've had a pretty smoothe experience but a few random hard crashes have occured.
Gripes: Bad balancing, a lot of units like the Chosen Uar Warriors are completely overpowered and mow through almost every other unit. Naval battles are kinda boring. Archers are straight retarded sometimes, often firing directly into the backs of friendly units in front of them instead of in an arc. Artillery is way too effective against settlement walls, one onager (the worst artillery unit in the game) can take down multiple sections of wall and still have ammunition. Things like siege towers and archer towers have too much fire resistance, often siege towers can take the direct fire of multiple archer units (fire arrows of course) and have maybe 30% fire damage by the time they reach your walls. AI is meh at best. The game is three years old and still $45.

-Think Rome is near defeat and then suddenly find a column of 40 heavily armored infantry at your door step.

Most of the game locked behind day one DLC. Thrones of Brittania is looking to be the same as this too just crammed into the U.K. I think the developers need to go back and play their older games. They might realise how far they have fallen. I wouldn't even care at this point if we got a modern game as good as Medieval 2 that had micro transactions. Just make them fun to play!

Can anyone explain how separatist factions can attack you with armys larger than the population of the town that they appeared in. Also with better troops than your nation has access to. Aliens?

[h1]Cheating Campaign AI[/h1]
The AI in ATTILA don't have to follow any of the same rules the player does. You have to manage food, money and a constantly diminishing public order, while the AI doesn't. I've seen the AI pop up massive armies and fleets even though they only own a SINGLE town! The AI will pop up a massive tax free army out of their single town then sit there the entire game waiting for you to leave. You have two options, you either call all your armies and zerg rush them or you employ an army to babysit them FOREVER. If you ignore them they'll start raiding and taking over your neighbouring towns so you have to employ an army for every GOD DAMN SINGLE TOWN THAT DOES THIS! Seriously the campaign AI in this game can go f*** its self.

[h1]Public Order[/h1]
What the f*** were CA thinking when they added a constantly diminishing public order to the game. Nearly every building you build will give minus public order so you spend 90% of your time fighting off rebellions. A rebellion back then would of been a large group of somewhat organised peasants depending on whether they have a rebellious lord to follow, but in ATTILA a rebellious army has weaponry, equipment and logistics which makes absolutely no sense! One of my towns entirely comprised of a farm and a pottery store just rebelled and they're all carrying swords, sheilds and chain mail WHERE THE F*** DID THEY GET THAT FROM!?

Attila campaign is officially broken. No I am not talking about crashes on a PC. No I am referring to the gameplay itself. You try playing as any other nation and vs the huns, the game is broken. The huns will come with horse archers that can both defend against missile and shoot theirs very accurately and rapidly. And if you think you can chase them down, good luck as they can shoot you while riding at top speeds. I know they meant this to be challenging and I played this on Hard difficulty, not even the legendary difficulty and it is harder than legendary difficulty on many other total war titles. Unless they remove either the missile defense of these troops or the accuracy or the ability to rapid fire even while galloping away, I by no means can recommend this broken game. If you plan to buy this game then make sure to buy the DLC Age of Charlemagne, as this is the only DLC that makes this game worth buying for campaign.

As for multiplayer it is too bad they allow the same hun cav missile units in the game. There is the OP setup where you go mostly missile cav in the Hun faction and bring just a few melee units to hold them.

22,41072812,english,"The campaign has no replay value because every campaign, you'll have Huns coming at you like a wrecking ball and WRE collapsing. The AI makes no effort at empire building, so you won't get any pleasant surprises like say a Frankish empire. Diplomacy is absolutely uninteresting because it's always everyone as part of the same ""We hate Romans"" crew and uniting on that point, until the Huns come along and then it becomes the ""We hate Huns AND Romans crew. Then there is the fact that 99% of my battles are boring garrison defense battles, due to the AI's behavior.

And then there is unit diversity/faction playstyle diversity. The lack of it in Attila hurts the singleplayer but ruins the multiplayer for me, which is a big part of the game. Battles also happen too fast and it's more of a click fest dependent on who has the faster cav charge click than on overall strategic/tactical planning.

Also naval battles suck and I do all my fighting on land, even with the viking factions, if you create a boat in your towns harbour , the next move and turn u have all the AI boats in the game storm to your city to destroy that 1 boat emediatly... i mean what a complete joke and useless AI i have never seem in any games yet , u cant even build up some boats , they AI wont allow you and they detect if u just make 1 boat right away and comes attacking you from all over as soon as you build one.

The political system kinda sucks to control but it basically boils down to dominion bring controlled by the influence balance of your generals (you can keep this fairly neutral by not having just family members or non family members as really active generals. The control seems a bit of a crapshoot that you can influence with either the ""gather support"" action or with those random events that pop up when you try and do other politics actions.

Worst graphics so far in any total war games.... , still uses the same graphic engine since Empire Total War, they just darkened everything to get out more contrast. You see nothing, everything is too dark, don't know who is foe who is you, its impossible to see who is the enemies or your own troops during a battle.

Worst camera... still uses the messed up camera of Empire Total War, where when you zoom in, it slows so much down, you think you move in slow motion

I tend to get overwhelmed by different factions and I don't have the ability to defend my territory, IE I'm spread too thin. On top of that if I ever have to fight a naval battle, 9/10 times in absolutely screwed.

I find Attila's UI and art style ultimately depressing, dark and heavy compared to the Rome II's one...
After I came back to Rome II I was shocked how clear and light everything is.

The game overall is kinda trash compered to other games like the rome total war , medieval total war series.... the AI is behaving so redicules and bad its a joke... i never get to build up any settlements , all i get are AI constantly sieging me , over and over and over untill im dead or just tired of defending the same city killing off hordes of invaders by setting my self up at a chokepoint with pikes..... even if u are about to get on top and ahead in the game , random troops pops up that dont belong to any factions and destroys you , they even team up with your enemies and go 2 and 3 v 1 on you , with 3-4 full forces each , so ur basically fighting 4x3 armies at once , the whole game is against you .... trying to make your game experience a living hell so u cant progress what so ever , neighbour factions refuse any kids of diplomecy or refuse to help u against other factions even if u offer them all u have and then some , its just a hot mess and a joke , this game is so bad i cant understand how people manage to play it.",1522106868,1522106903,False,7,0,0.415293097496032715,0,True,False,False,76561198052896501,66,20,1934,0,1634.0,1552719818,,

The Game is decent, quite more advanced that Rome II which doesn’t have factions that are nomadic as far as I am aware of, Cool Razing effects as you can see the province get razed. Would recommend you to buy this during a sale rather than full price, I would recommend playing as the Eastern Roman Empire as its quite fun to play as. Lots of controversy about the issue with starting up Total War Attila, luckily I wasn’t affected.

30,40972296,english,"CA did listen to the fans and this game really feels and plays like a superbly modded version of Rome 2

Attila feels to me a massive return to form.

This is why:

CA did listen to the fans and this game really feels and plays like a superbly modded version of Rome 2 that wasn’t so lame. 
I even played a Seleucid campaign in Rome 2 recently and confirmed that Attlia is way better not just in terms of graphics but also the distance between settlements that results in fewer sieges and more land battles which is a very good thing.

You have a family tree to you can see who relates to who, who is loyal, who needs to have their loyalty improve or removed, who needs to be married and who to side line. – I must say I have am loving this bit of the game, especially sending off disloyal family members to raid faraway lands and keep them out of trouble.
Politics has improved as you carry out actions through influence rather than paying money making it challenging when you have a young inexperienced faction leader.

It has two Huge Roman empires to sack pillage and grind into the dust.

Combat seems way more dynamic with the need to co-ordinate spear, melee and cavalry to win but also adapted to the different enemies fighting Germanics, Romans and Huns does feel like a different experience. Hunnic horse archer is very difficult to fight against if you do not have powerful bows in you faction but can be countered if you use the shieldwall ability to soak up their arrows and then crush them when they are out. In all combat feels a lot more balanced and makes more sense

You can turn off the awful 3d animated portraits.

The coming winter puts a pressure on food and squalor preventing you from just playing like risk and sitting on one area building up and rolling forward like a wave.

The dynamism of migrating peoples making it hard to develop water tight cordons around your lands.

I know people have complained about razing settlement but if you use this mechanic to create a buffer zone you can then build up behind it can be superb. I also like the fact that if you have had a particularly bloody and agent heavy war with assassination and counter assassination of family members you just want to raze them and not rule them!

The campaign feels more fluid and challenging with fighting off and dodging the Hunic hordes and other factions.

In all I think Attila is a great Total War game and one that really deserve its place in the series.

Thank you CA for listening I fully appreciate what you did with Attila.

However, you will quickly realize that there are fewer factions to play as, and the coolest ones, that's right, cost extra. There is so much missing content in this game that it feels dishonest and dissapointing. 

Gameplay is decent. Campaign AI is smart challenging which is nice. However, the battle AI is still pretty dumb. 

Atilla has improved on all fronts of previous titles, however it is not revolutionary, the focus for this game was seemed to be profit, not making an enjoyable videogame.

56,39446594,english,"I've played a ton of TW games, but this particular one makes me feel it was rushed just like Rome 2. At lease R2TW still received patches and support. The AI completely sucks in pathfinding and executing orders, imagine in a siege battle you tried to get a rear charge with your cavalry but more than half of the unit run into the wall instead of a blob of enemies, or they just flee in the opposite direction, or just ignoring your order and stop,sometimes they just take a relaxing walk instead of rushing by your order. As I remember this was fixed and it's much better in R2TW, TWWH1 and TWWH2.

Secondly, the artificial illogical hidden AI buffs in Legendary/VH difficulty, I can live fine with AI's campaign buff but the battle buff ruins it all when some enemy levies can go toes to toes with your elite infantry, or even better. Your general dies with half of his body guard alive, when their general is one of the last 5 be killed, Huns troops would fight to the last man and never rout if you killed their general. (srsly hunnic horse archer/uar warrior often fight with one man even if morale is -32 already). Changing battle difficulty in settings does not get rid of it at all. On campaign map, if you managed to destroy one Hunnic army but let one unit away, he will replenish full of a stack in the next turn on your own territory without encamping (WTF?) and immediately gives vengeance on your weak and withered army. AI agents buff is annoying and unreal, they can kill your 9 stars generals/agents easily with a level 2 spy, while your 10 stars Champion gets Critical failure with a 80% positive outcome, your agents will fail most of the time I'm sure with you.  CA you are trying  too hard to make your game stupid. Gold and silver armor/weapon/chevron upgrade do not make any changes in your unit stats, only bronze give a small boost, I tell you chevron and upgrades are just decorations.

AI's missile accuracy in a nutshell: ""pinpoint and fast reloading as hell"". AI's attilery NEVER MISS,they know your movement pattern and will aim for that, the only thing to trick it is carefully micro your horses after they fire. one unit of small ornager can destroy a standing cavalry unit in 2 volleys, they just need one volley to destroy a tower and snipe your onagers before they realize something,like is was taken from Empire TW's cannon codes, meanwhile your  large onager needs to fire at least 2-3 and more volleys to get one tower. Your archers and crossbows are stupid as **** firing in a straight line spreading and do team kill even you managed to micro to the back of a blob of enemy,their missiles still spread in a triangular shape. AI's crossbowmen fire in an arc upward in total accurate style and twice faster than your archers standing on the wall, destroying them. DON'T buy archers in this game as WRE, they can't even kill horse archers or enemy missile units standing still doing tiny damage and miss too much. I have seen a Hunnic horse archer ate 3 arrows and still alive. ANNOYING KITING AI, the devs gave the AI a supreme cheat whenever you click to chase enemy missile unit, it immediately gives them the code to run away! when you click stopchasing, they comeback and shoot right after. It is not related to skirmish mode as they run away at certain distance anymore.

The fertility mechanic which makes the weather colder nonstopable, that lower your food supply and all. at least we can use a mod to fix it.

Horrible unit design, you cannot say which one is higher tier units by their outer look, the Roman Empires design looks really bad no matter historical accuracy. (luckily one of my countryman created a mod named ""Elite WRE ERE"" and brought the game very close to Barbarian Invasion)

Stupidly low garrison troops, as WRE you have only one spear, one melee, one cavalry and one javelin unit(even for capital!?), they are all low tier until level 4 building (what?) and 100% defenseless agaisnt horde of barbarians early game, you hardly build a watch tower  because there aren't much more units until late game and it takes one building slot which is necessary for public order and food. The babysitting is real and frustrating.

Overcomplicated game mechanic,counting fertility one. Diseases that spread from neighbor factions that trade with you,despite your sanitation is good, but upgraded armory and weapons cannot be shipped to Legionaries in the front,Instead they have to go back to the region which has upgrade buildings,or excess food in one region cannot be used to help starving ones? ; Total food supply is positive but if one specific region is not a bread basket, you are screwed. Buildings which you never touch because their negative effects are more than its income. Loyalty mechanic that fucks up with the office given to subordinate trait. Don't bother to use office boost in this game,your generals loyalty will be no more, for example you give an office to a 2 stars general, the 2-10 stars in the pool will get mad which I can understand like in real life. If you give a 2 stars a lower rank office and a 5 stars the higher one, the 5 stars and all others waiting in the pool are still pi*sed, wtf.

AI that overaggressive and does ""wallhack"" on campaign map, you barely see ahead but they find and kill you suddenly with two full stacks. They'll try to avoid your towns with army and rush through the unprotected ones behind just to sack them, even when they know you will hunt them down in the next turn to kill them all, But when your troops and number are more superior than theirs, they will cowardly leave their settlements empty and run away,they don't even defend their large settlements. That's pure annoying and I have to delete the game. Luckily it's much better in Warhammer, even campaign mechanic is closer to Rome 2 and its predecessors.

Unit spacing problem in siege/forest/ fence, obstacles.

Many people may say I need to play on normal then but I always play on Legendary/VH because I like challenge, YET not the fake stupidly overwhelming one, it takes away the game's immersion and fun aspect, replaced by stressful and unreal gameplay. This game has so much potential and the concept of game mechanic is great, but It was very poor executed and lazyly refined. 

P/s: Instead of deleting the game I'll continue to play to exploit flaws and to write in this thread. Only one plus point I have seen so far is Generals and Agents change their appearance leveling up, and now there are factions that like powerful empires. Don't get me wrong I beat the campaign on very hard as Western Roman Empire, still doesn't feel good at all.",1516314488,1520177203,False,18,1,0.625908076763153076,1,True,False,False,76561198061241179,139,23,16548,0,10685.0,1577020773,,

Pros

The Horde mechanic is  great! Every game can be so drastically different from another game as you are free to take your people wherever you want and found your civilization in any region. 

The Family tree is great. In all honesty, I hated it when I first started playing this game. As of now, I love it. It makes your faction, along with the others you interact with in the world feel so much more real. You are not just a faction, but a kingly lineage within your faction. This feaute also also gives diplomacy more depth. As a total war player, I always felt like alliances were a waste of time and would opt to choose to just kill those potential allies for their land. Sharing land with a ally for a military ally at the cost of being able to use a provincial edict was absolutley not worth it. Now with the family tree, you can make someone a govener of a province, enabling the use of an edict even if you only have a single cty in the province. With the family tree, you can also marry off the daughters of your family to strengthen bonds with another faction or vise versa. In my most recent game, I was the king of Mercia. Rather than just kill everyone in England, I united England under the banners of Mercia, Northumbria and Wessex. The Kings of Ireland declared war on me, so I strengthend the unity of my nation with my allies by marrying off a daughter to each country. After taking Ireland, all of England was unified. I then went to war with the Vikings while also organizing a marriage between myself and the Kingdom of Charlemange. After all of Engalnd and France was unified, all of the remaining Christian nations allied themsleves together. Like a wave we crashed upon the Muslim and Nordic empires . We won a Domination victory. This game woke me up to the usefulness of diplomacy and alliances that are now possible in Attilla that I found lacking in previous titles.

Cons

The graphics it requires is too much. I could run Rome 2 on ultra no problem and I can run the Warhammer games higher than Attilla. I definatley need a new Graphics card but still damn boi.

Faction diversity. The expansions dont really have this issue as much imo but still, this franchise has had this problem for a couple titles now. Factions just feel to similar when it comes to units. This is my own opinion.

I would reccomend this game, but wait for a sale, it goes on for a good prices often!

84,40147406,english,"Attila takes everything good about Rome 2 and fine tunes it. The combat is smoother, grittier, and makes more sense. Naval battles finally have depth and factions have culture specific ships. Setting cities ablaze in battle becomes a tactical option as opposed to a scenic side effect.

The primary campaign, in my mind, plays out in one of three ways: either you're a major empire trying to staunch the bleeding as your territory gets eaten at from all sides (Western Rome, Eastern Rome, arguably Sassanids), you're a barbarian empire trying to build a kingdom off of territory taken from Rome (almost everyone else), or you're the Huns and you're there to move around the map wrecking as much as possible without picking the wrong fight, All three workflows are equally entertaining.

The expansions provide further variety; The Last Roman offers a ""two ways to play"" choice for its titular character, either remaining an army on the move and reclaiming everything for the Emperor in Constantinople, or declaring your independence and rebuilding the Western Empire for yourself. Or you could be the barbarians, for some reason. In any case, it's peppered throughout with interesting pseudohistorical missions from different sponsors that often find themselves at odds with each other and leave you to figure out the lesser of two evils. Age of Charlemagne is in many ways a fantastic callback to Medieval 2 and even sports a different, Bayeux Tapestry-esque art style.

The diplomatic system is just as broken as ever if not worse than Empire Total War.

There is no middle ground despite there being a normal difficulty. I honestly understand why no real Total War fan acts like this game exists. With that said this game does have 2 good things about it. Everything else is either broken or incomplete, those two things are. 1. The Storyline in the Grand Campaign is beautiful and cinamatic despite poor optimization, I have to turn off all other sound in the room and sit back and enjoy the ingame videos. And 2, the battles, despite having an inferior engine for melee combat, the battles and clashes look and feel solid, I thought they restored the old engine for melees or had a hybrid engine until I zoomed in to see the um scripted gliding that had to be done to initiate an animation. Unfortunately with all the essential and basic features of previous good Total war games removed like say stand-your-ground, you have to babysit every unit.

Because I realy do like the total war series I will start off with whats good about the game so that I don't just come off as a hater

Positives: 
-Nomad factions are a great fun way to play I and I really enjoy that added versatility 
-graphics on the battle map are decent(running on max) its the campaign map that realy looks good though. 

Negatives: 
-Its just like Rome 2, like honestly it is a re skin pretty much which isn't bad, but there is no reason it couldn't have just been a DLC
-The campaign AI is complete shit(honestly this is what ruins the game)
-Greedy devs rather than productive devs

Now of course I will elaborate on the negatives, the first is pretty self explanitory, but the campaign AI is the big one, if you're like me not only do you play this game because of the big armies and people killing eachother, but for the historical realism and being able to replicate and change things in history in the form of the total war campaign, well kiss any historical realism goodbye in this game, you just aren't gonna get it. For example my first game I went as Visigoths and Was enjoying myself raiding the undefended roman cities, by turn 20 or so I had gotten down into rome and had succesfully sacked it, at this point I was thinking it was a little too easy, I had not even met and roman armies, only garissons. My next goal was to go down into spain and sack those roman cities and just continue being a nuisance. On my way back up north through italy I find what was missing the whole time, 4 full stack armies are right above florence which I don't have any prayer of beating. Now here's the big surprise, those 4 armies weren't even Roman, they were all Hun armies that decided that fuck history they only want to attack the visigoths now, so of course they chase me south into italy and since I I am nomadic I do'nt have time to make a fleet to sail out and they kill of my people in the corner of Sicily and that is the end. Now I realy woudn't have minded al that much if those armies had been roman, because at least that would be semi accurate, although there still should have been resistance going into rome, but no its dmaned Huns. I of course go onto forums and find out that this problem has been happenning since 2015 and Devs have done nothing to fix it, which brings me to my 3rd point, which is that the Devs for Tota war, do not make updates or patches or any kind of improvment to the game, unless you have to throw down the big bucks to get it, and of course all they release are DLC. with added campaigns and more stuff that doesnt matter as long as the AI is still trash. Medieval 2 is what I have played the most and the AI in that is horrible as well so I coming into Attila, a much newer TW expected some improvement. So what did I find, I found that it was different... But it was still so bad that this game is pretty unplayabe to me if I actually want to enjoy it to the ful extent that I should be able to. Most people would say they will change their review if the devs fix things, but you don't have to worry about that with TW because you know they never will.",1516000388,1516000388,False,13,3,0.563704431056976318,0,True,False,False,76561198138242149,240,4,13705,0,2544.0,1600478654,,

Bought the game on sale, still requested refund. Denied, since I have 14 hours of empty play-time from having to restart the campaign 4-5 times and having to wait glitched battles out until the timer forces a draw (that's 20 minutes every glitched battle).

I feel like I have been cheated. The game's AI is in such an abhorrent state that you need to constantly save games like back in the day with Fallout 3. Otherwise, you risk losing your entire campaign to a game-breaking glitch, like AI ships refusing to attack in a siege battle with unlimited timer (leaving you in an eternal stalemate) or your ships bugging out while boarding so you lose control of them (again, potentially leaving you in an eternal stalemate).

Some of these issues can be""solved"" by not playing with an unlimited timer, but I don't exactly consider it a fix to wait 20 minutes every other time I'm besieged because the game is holding my computer f*cking hostage. I have found plenty of other players echoing these issues, some of which CA has responded to, some of which are from 2013. This is apparently not a new problem, and they know. They just didn't give a f*ck when they sold me this sh*t, and haven't bothered to fix it since then.

I love the Total War franchise, but this is unacceptable. Apart from the AI, the game is filled with obvious last-minute wrap-ups, like half of the portraits being lazy CGI screenshots (as opposed to hand drawn images like the rest). Some of them are even the same CGI environments, just zoomed out (look at the Amber Trader and Amber Market portraits). Another good one is rain falling upwards or sideways on half of the art-assets during battles. This is not to optimize the game, it doesn't save space or CPU, it saves development time otherwise spent on fixing it, so they can churn out some more faction or f*cking gore DLCs, that should have been in the game to begin with. Of course, this isn't game-breaking, it's just indicative of how little of a sh*t they give about the consumers or the product they're selling them. If these were the only issues, I'd happily recommend this in a heartbeat. However, spending 2 hours of my afternoon staring at my screen, waiting for stalemated battles to time out, somewhat soured my opinion.",1514962857,1514971553,False,3,0,0,5,True,False,False,76561197991045872,659,60,4124,0,900.0,1586272905,,

On the pro side:
- Vastly different campaigns depending on what you're interested in; nomads bent on killing and destorying, barbarian kingdoms starting small and creating empires, and vast empires fighting to retain their incessantly raided borders.
- Blood and gore DLC, plus battle mods from the workshop, make battles realistic.
- Friendly fire exists.
- Tactics appear to be more essential in this title vs. others.
- Interesting dilemmas.
- Family tree, intrigue, dominion, and control are great features for controlling inner politics.
- Traits for generals and governors add another interesting element to the game.

On the con side:
- Glitches... there was a glitch in my Geat campaign where a whole portion of my family tree (including my heir) were listed as other nobles, so I couldn't use normal family intrigue with them--had to declare a new heir in fear that giving the crown to a potential non-family member could wreck my campaign. Very minor stuff outside of this.

The whole idea of burning cities and villages in Total War: Attila is pretty cool! 

Trying to perform even the simplest type of unit redeployment inside of a city or village, however, will, in two out of three cases, drive you, as the human player, freaking mad due to the complexity of the new and fairly detailed city and village battle maps that are cluttered with random little objects - junk, scrap and what not - which all interfere with your ability to position or move your units around like you would normally expect in a real-time battle of the Total War series. It is now, in comparison to Rome2, almost always simply impossible to navigate through or reposition your units inside of a city or village without getting instantly foam at your mouth when there always seems to be something - invisible - that is obstructing or hindering your units from changing position!

You can honestly never be sure that what looks like an obvious position for your units to deploy or path to move along is actually useable terrain, and it's seriously freaking painful to manage even if you're enthusiastic about TW: Attila.. 

And to add insult to injury, the game even starts to hang inside of city or village maps whenever you try to drag a square to redeploy one of your units thanks to all the fancy, new city and village [i]decorations[/i].. I think it's fair to say that this is evidence for Creative Assembly mindlessly adding new features to an old and never really convincing game engine without actually playtesting what they were doing.

TW: Attila is in a lot of places a solid step forward compared to Rome2, but in other ones, like the new city/ village maps, an obvious step back.. I never ever had such a bad time ordering my units around inside of cities or villages in Rome2. The only thing that remotely resembles my bad experience in Attila are Rome 2's ramparts where the game starts to severely drop frames whenever parts of a unit get stuck somewhere..

""You built an empire beyond imagining. The pinnacle of human achievement and the envy of the world. Did you think it would last? The eternal city. That glorious monument to power, culture and learning. But the Old Wolf lies wounded; surrounding by jackals; circled by vultures. Worried to death by a thousand, tiny vicious mouths— brought low by your own arrogance. These are the death throes of Rome. The light of civilisation dims and gutters. And if such precious time was left to hide your women, for your children to cry, even at the moment of your final defeat you would still take no comfort in oblivion. For I am coming for you. I RIDE WITH A MILLION WARRIORS! I BRING THE END OF DAYS!!. I AM!! THE SCOURGE!! OF GOD!!!. And I will watch your world... Burn. “

These are the words that Attila greets you with into the world of Attila Total War. His world, so it would seem.

Total War: Attila is the installment in Total War, a franchise of turn based strategy games. Total War's unique selling point is combining turn-based campaign management in the continental scope, with real time battles with a potencial of many thousands of troops battling it out in a map, with you in total control of one side. After a mostly failed launch of Rome II installment, plagued by performance issues and bugs, the developer, Creative Assembly was focused on fixing Rome II and developing Attila. Not only they managed to redeem Rome II from its technical issues, but they also managed to churn out an excellent upgrade to it, which is what we should regard Attila Total War as. It is a great improvement in both the game mechanics and climate.

The Setting

“The walls shall shake at the noise of the horsemen, and of the wheels, and of the chariots”
- Ezekiel, XXVI, 10 

The year when the campaign starts is 395 AD and the grim and cruel promise by our friend Attila could not have hit a better time. Years of mismanagement and the subsequent splitup of the Roman Empire, has brought its western half down to its knees. The Eastern Roman Empire fares only somewhat better. Internal struggles tear the Rome apart. As if it wasn't enough, the climate changes. It gets colder and not only the fertility of the Roman lands will fail, causing famines and further disorder, but the barbarians that once lived beyond Rome will be compelled to move out of their homes, right into the falling empire. And on top of the food chain of the desperates and hordes, admits the smoke, blood and cold, the Huns, will come. With them, death, war, pestilence and hunger. Above them, Attila. Flaggorum Dei.

Regardless of which faction you pick to play as, the Total War, up until now being all about ascending into great and soon sole power in the world, offer you much different prospects, both in theme, and in situation. The game slogan puns Rome II's “How far will you go for Rome?”, going “How far will you go to survive?” And indeed, the first choices you will make will not determine your ascendancy: Just your survival as a realm.

Otherwise, the game does not differ much from the usual Total War deal. Settlements with buildings, armies that you lead to your own and enemy territory, all on turn-based, good-looking map. The two primary aspects of the faction you play as on the campaign map, are its settlements which make you money as you develop them and its armies, which are raised from your cities. The said armies can move out on the map to defend your possessions and to expand them. That's a very basic description.
The Campaign

“Nothing happens to anybody which he is not fitted by nature to bear”
-Marcus Aurelius 


Much like Napoleon Total War was more or less a fixed Empire Total War, this can be best described as an upgrade to Rome II system. The food mechanic actually matters now, with the introduction of provincial fertility system: Some provinces will yield more food than others. Fertility decreases overtime, giving you that sense of the nature itself turning against you and conveying in a perfect way what drove the Great Migration that was a nail in the coffin of Roman Empire. For if you are non-Roman, your land stops supporting you and you are faced with prospect of a famine (or when the Huns start molesting you), you have an option to become a migrating horde: The star and prime mechanic of the game.
When you start a migration, all your settlements are razed and abandoned (provinces can actually be ownerless now), but your armies are given the additional aspect: The transition to nomadic lifestyle is manifested in the armies being given population and ability to make buildings, essentially becoming mobile cities. However, unlike static settlements, those cities would be lost for good if their army was unmade. They have unique building chains and will be on the move until they can find a place you deem worthy of conquering, upon which you lose your city aspect of your armies. Or stay mobile forever. It's up to you.

The user interface can be a bit of a pain to learn to control, espeically if you're not familiar with Total War. Perhaps such is the fate of interfaces conveying the amount of information that Attila one does, but it's still compounded by a relatively high difficulty level. Every choice will have to be weighted carefully, unless you fancy reloading saves as often as some do in XCOM games (read: often.) Nonetheless the game does not condemn you to that gloomy apocalyptic feel of the call to migrate being a matter of life or death. Depending on what you choose to play as you could start out as a migrant horde, or be Sassanid Empire, living it up in the ever-hot and fertile Middle East. Or you could lead Huns and eventually, the Scourge of God himself. Or, if you are up for an ultimate empire building, no, empire survival challenge, you can place yourself at the helm of Western Roman Empire. Can you turn the tide of history and make the Rome great again? Or will Attila watch your world burn? It has its issues, though: major league micromanagement being one of them. It's also nigh-impossible to win while maintaining Christian temples, which are all very, very expensive in upkeep. Seriously, I understand that excessive Church spending is what brought down the Byzantium and that Catholics like me love their church bling, but this stuff is extreme. Get a mod that buffs Christianity if you're going for Western Rome.

Speaking of religion, its relevance is further fleshed out and manifests itself in tensions of heathen populaces and diverse bonuses provided by religious buildings. A realm that accumulated enough populace of a certain faith, can make that faith its official religion, which will influence the aesthetics of its army and what its troops talk about, further boosting the immersion in the culture you lead.

Politics were a painful aspect of Rome 2 that were too irrelevant unless something really started to break the order. Attila fixed them. Now, the low and high power balances bring along both benefits and disadvantages,with absolute political dominance coming with high debuffs, making it justifiable in only few select situations. Even armies have integrity value: losing battles and not resting in friendly territory will cause them to revolt against you.

Each general and family member is now of certain loyalty, which is a variable that handles rising of civil wars from now on. Total political balance is influenced by A: How much influence (sort of political mana) your family as a whole has compared to other generals/characters and B: By level of control, which is a static value influenced by the political events. Your ruler can also have children. Male children will eventually become generals or governors, depending on your pick, whilst female children can be sold... eeh, married, to powerful non-family member characters to shift the political balance in favor of your family, or sent to marry abroad, to gain you a foreign ally.

Civil war army pops up, ok i sent an army to intercept, predictable retreat, i send the army further and its just short. Next turn. Civilwar army accelerates away into the darkness, recruits mercs, comes back with unbeatable force. Hmmm ok but i know i can retreat away cause i just watched it take half its moves....wrong, i retreat it catches up and attacks again, i lose and the remains of my army retreats again. OMG.. its not finished yet, allowing itself a further move, got to be around 3x what my armys move by now, it chases down and exterminates the dregs. What a cart load. 

Its not so much bad as just boring, its inferior to medieval2 in so many ways, partiularly in being fun to play. Its DLC and pay to unlock factions are travesty, pay for blood and dismemberment in a game about hacking people up? are they trolling their customers or what? Its just so dishonest and imo its killing gaming. As a rule i tend to avoid anyhting with SEGA written on it but having departed from TW after empires release i was interested to see how things had changed and picked this up on sale. TBH i would be annoyed if i had payed full price for this idiot trap DLC shop. Somebody make SS for attila..pleasepleasplease.

 There is no significant improvement in the franchise and the game feels as if it only has less features. Added buildings don't appear in the cities the way they did in earlier Total War titles either.

Hadrian's Wall has no impact on gameplay. You still cannot control the direction your army routes. Towns and forts inexplicably decide not to add gates so as to speed up the gameplay.

+ Stunning graphics depicting the early Dark Ages: Fire, Sword [strike]Magic, and Dragon[/strike]. Building destruction features more smoke and particle effects, and for the first time arrow shots boast a clearer trajectory, as fire arrows could possibly light up the night sky, certainly to impress.
+ Epic battlefield simulation, especially when intense AI combat between a desperate Roman soldier and a blood-thirsty Gothic warrior feels so hardcore and real.
+ Featuring unforgettable-as-always soundtracks perfectly suited to every frame during the game, also with impressive exotic Nomadic (especially Hunnic, inspired by Mongolian Hoomii), Byzantine and Persian-style melodies.
+ Typical hardcore Total-War experience as there are no eternal allies, no constant economic booming nor continuous good luck, it's only War that never changes, and CA has added some new elements to the politics, where being in power depend no only on pure-influence anymore, and they introduced a brand-new nomadic system, with settlement-destruction now an available option. But to some, this broader focus on political intrigue or city ravaging rather than pure war makes Total War Attila less of a warm welcome than previous titles, Shogun 2 and Rome 2.
+ Perfect units overhaul, especially with the help of Steam Workshop for enhanced accuracy on history. When playing Shogun 2 I would always remember, in some 80 percent of gameplay, watching identical spearmen and bowmen fighting on both sides of the battlefield, and some clan-typical units are just too expensive even after you manage to clear the whole map.
+ Enjoyable experience playing as the Huns, as both the morale debuffs on the enemies or simply improved Parthian Archery would guarantee a unique decisive-victory experience, which is only realizable in Attila.
+ Good War logic. In Attila, morale would play an important role but just no so decisive as in previous games, where it would take forever for multiple groups of infantry units to cause great casualties to each other, while in Shogun 2, a group of samurais with their flanks exposed to ashigaru militias would quickly scatter and be slaughtered. And more importantly, Total War Attila has kind of made cavalry units great again, where generals are no longer ridiculously vulnerable to spearmen, making them again good victory-claimers by simply going round and biting the enemies' tails, [strike]and making Attila a game of the horsemen[/strike]. It's probably because of the rise of ""stirrup"" as well as shock cavalry around that time, which appears no later than the famous Charles-Mattel's Victory of Poitiers.

- Elaborate in-game CG animations are now nowhere to be seen any more, with Shogun 2 being the last title to date to feature tons of incident animations.
- Frame rate optimization is poor, making Attila a qualified hardware-killer in 2015.

I got into Total War from the Warhammer franchise so when I started playing this game, I was shocked how much complexity the game offers compared to Warhammer. I now know what they meant by ""streamlining"". Therefore this review is for people who have played Total War: Warhammer and not any previous installment. 

TWA has what TWW doesn't have.

= Weather Conditions: Rain, fog, dryness determines the battle a lot. The fog of war as well as flamability can be affected by these.

= Varying Tax Rates: You can set the national tax rate to different values in addition to exempting regions from taxes.

= Flammability: You can set stuff on fire and it can affect the enemies morale. Some people (like Atilla) want to watch the world burn.

= Court Intrigue: You can have heirs, wives, court system.

= Varying arrow ammunition. Heavy, Normal, Fire, Whistling Arrows all have their special uses. You can switch during the battle. Fire boulders and normal boulders for artillery.

= Sea Battles and Naval Invasions: Something that TWW cannot have unfortunately.

= Better Siege Battles: You can actually surround a city as well as having actual towns in fights.

= Disease (Not like the Skaven disease)

So far, I'm having a blast with the game but I did prefer playing AoC due to the setting.
I got the game on sale so I highly recommend you do the same as the price can drop hard for this title. For that reason it isn't worth $45 as you can get it on sale for cheap.

64,37752996,english,"Alright, so I've played several Total War games. Played Medieval and Medieval 2 when they came out and honestly was never very good at the games. But I enjoyed myself no less. I've poked around at a couple other Total War titles, Rome 2 felt weird and I saw a lot of peopple didn't like it. Total War Shogun 2, I haven't touched much, so can't say much there either. But Attila is what hooked me. That said, let's get on with it.

Total War Attila has several layers to it. But nothing horribly overhwelming, at least in terms of actually learning the game. Figuring out the way dominion, power and such balance out is a bit of trial and error, but once understood it's an aspect of the game easily controlled. But when taken advantage of and using politics as a means of gain over just battle and territory gain can come at a massive advantage later in the game. Especially when the star of the game shows up, Attila the Hun and his Mongol horde. But we'll talk about the horde in a moment. Other gameplay elements remain very similar to the other Total War titles I've played. A modest but fleshed out variety of units with a great unit-counter tree with a somewhat clunky UI that can feel like it's throwing a lot of information at you. It's another trial an error thing, but hardly confusing, just requires practice to the uninitiated.

Graphics look fantastic for it's time and still look good. However the game can have it's slow downs and sharp drops in fps. I'm no coder 'nor do I understand computing language. So whether it's just poor optimization or the game simply requiring a bit more processing power than it says is a mystery to me. I'll drop my PC's specs at the end of review for comparison. But for the most part, things run fairly smooth and I think it should be expected for things to chug a little bit when there are over 4000+ units on the field engaged in battle. If you've ever played major 4x games like Civilization 5 & 6 or Sins of a Solar Empire, I'm sure you'll understand the late game struggle when your fps slowly but surely drops due to the sheer amount of things going on at any given time by that point.

I do feel some of the game was chopped up for additional content, but I honestly feel like the base game still has a modest wealth of content. Nothing mindblowing, but it hasn't left me wanting, considering a single grand campaign can potentially take twenty hours at the bare minimum, but of course, I'm hardly an expert at this game. But I suppose the developer/publisher needs that little extra revenue stream if that ensures we get more great Total War games in the future, if of course, that is the intent.

Now, the horde. And one other thing. First we'll talk about the issue with the horde. They've overpowered a bit. At first it's not so much, be given about sixty or so turns in the game, they turn into not only a force to be reckoned with, but depending on several variables, they become just short of unstoppable. Though this isn't entirely the development teams fault, as they DO give the option for quite a bit of diplomacy and even forewarn that only your struggling barbarian empire or divided Roman empire cannot hold back the horde alone. But even then, the Huns have the uncanny ability to just roll over almost everything in sight. So it's one of those cases where they are in fact overpowered, but can be overcome with strategic planning and not overextending your empire.

I'm not doing very good with this review. So let us talk about that other thing. Difficulty. The AI is really only so smart and from what I can tell, will usually use the same tactics no matter the difficulty. I'm not sure, but I highly suspect the change to difficulty only modifies the amount of money other empires get, giving them an edge against your empire, which, mid to late game, becomes almost traumatic and tremendously difficult. Especially the Hunnic empire, which will have cash bleeding out of every orifice. 

Now I haven't even touched multiplayer yet due to both a lack of confidence in myself and my general distaste of playing multiplayer games in general. So my opinion there is a blank, sorry.

Now a quick note involving the dlc packs. One of which is garbage and should be made free for the game. A dlc that adds blood and dismemberment, along with some other animations that would steep this game into the Mature rating. This content wasn't added to keep a Teen rating which is ridiculous and outright theft. Now that may be a bit of a leap and really isn't terribly damaging to reputation, but a very stupid move by the publisher to reach other demographics while alienating others due to highly questionable business tactics.

Not much else to say I guess. Game looks good, plays good and overall has a nice fit to it. Though it still sells for something like $45(USD) I think it's almost worth it's price. If you see it on sale and have enjoyed the Total War series before, get this game without hesitation. I know at this moment, on sale, it's about $12(USD) which is quite a discount. Though to be honest, I feel the base price should be lower due to the overpriced DLC which comes with the game, but doesn't do anything truly interesting. But yea, I'd recommend this game. Just buyer beware and pay attention to what the DLC has to offer and check out other reviews.

They cluttered the formerly clean gameplay with tedious make work that promotes gamey min-maxing rather than actual strategy.  AI factions simply depend on vast numbers to overwhelm the player. The unit types are disappointing and I found myself to be forcing myself through the turns rather than enjoying them.  Graphics are bland.

I thought it might just be that campaign so tried with other factions and DLC campaigns such as Charlemagne, but it's the new engine and what is hard coded into the thing.

I haven't tried Warhammer yet, but if it is based on Attila, I WILL NOT BUY IT.

All is not lost, as I will have plenty of enjoyment going back to Shogun II, Rome II, Napoleon, and even Empire (with the Darth Mod).

Overall it's a great game, though having some aspects that may not be the best.

It's also the first historically themed Total War game for so long, especially with warhammer being their main focus.

Pros:
-The map is massive! So much to conquer
-Interesting theme, with the roman empire falling and germanic empires taking over
-Fights are good, with lots of good troops (Though melee cav is now op like melee infantry was in Rome 2)
- AOC is an amazing DLC! Totally worth the buy.
- The workshop opens so many possibilities, with many people making overhauls with new factions!

Cons:
-DLC, so much dlc. Although the AOC is in my opinion a good dlc, the others, especially the ones to get factions in the main game, is insane. DLC should not be allowed in a 40 dollar game, or not for factions that you should have.
- Politics is useless. I mean you get that extra 2% but you can easily win without it.
- God damn spies. The AI cheats a ton, with ways to make absurd amounts of money when they should clearly not be able to afford to obtain so many troops and armies. 
- The AI, along with cheating are pretty easy to deal with, mainly being annoying (especially being able to make so many armies and send like 20 spies and champions)
- I don't get how fertility becomes so bad in such a short amount of time, it's incredibly unrealistic of how fertility actually was in the 5th century, and it is difficult to recover lost fertility.
- Imperium stops you from making more armies, with now instead of money allowing you to make more armies, it is regions that decide how many you can make.
-Campaigns are often long, unless you set your own victory goals.
-Christianity sucks. If you are any nation with any form of Christianity rid of it immediately.",1455340623,1511398679,True,1,1,0.519999980926513672,0,True,False,False,76561198057517488,156,11,14548,0,8101,1596076691,,

The campaign AI is generally pretty terrible, siege battle AI when attacking is bad as well. When doing open field battles I have had good experiences though. It feels like I'm dragging myself through the monotony of the campaign for those few awesome land battles. The long turn times don't help either.

The only campaign I played through was the Franks, and the unit variety was disappointing. Waiting that long to get research done in the tech tree to get a unit that is a few points better in a few stats but otherwise exactly the same. I only made it up to Minor Victory - and I really wanted to continue but I had to ask myself how much fun I was actually having.

Nico here from the Creative Assembly community team. I am  sorry to hear that you have experienced such issues during play. Could you please provide further details about the configuration you have been using?

If they match with the minimum/recommended specs, I would suggest that you make sure you are using the latest drivers for your graphics & sound cards and that all files have been installed properly. If the game hasn’t been installed properly (i.e. missing or corrupted files during the installation) or if you are using outdated drivers, the game won’t be able to run nor start properly.

If you need assistance to update you graphic and sound drivers, it is best that you contact the manufacturer of your graphics card / sound card directly.

If you are still experiencing those issues while playing the game, do not hesitate to contact our Support team on our official forum (create a new thread):

First off this is an entirely different game then any of the others. While the original objective had always been to conquer, the objective in Atilla is to survive. It does the era great justice in illustrating how difficult it was to achieve even an ounce of cooperation. As a history buff I loved this title (despite how goddamn frustrating it can be, I've rage quit an entire campaign at least 25 times). 
Pros:
Mechanics are almost identical to other total war titles
Graphics look decent
Different approach to battle, management and diplomacy yet still behaves like a total war game
New fun, rewarding details (like army stances, sanitation, and ambush mapping)
(Opinion): 
I like the combat style much better than previous war titles and diplomacy is much more intriguing

Cons: 
Sometimes your dealt a very bad hand early on and just have to start over.
Limited units
They make you pay for DLC that should have been in the game anyway (this one really annoys me)
Tech tree is just used to unlock new buildings pretty much. No advancement is very significant or changes okay style.
The Huns are super OP (but if your a history buff like me then you may not mind this as much.)
(Opinion:)
The limited tech tree and units really frustrated me. I wanted to gain an advantage over my opponents in at least one area of the campaign (battle, economy, etc) and I was unable to. Plenty of new technologies arose in the middle ages and weren't seen. The ones they did include didn't help much.

Basically everything that was wrong with the immensely solid Rome 2 is fixed in this game, agents are more useful (although AI does spam their actions big time), campagin is just more solid, AI occasionaly make decisons on the map a cognitive human might, overall the campagin map has just been tightened up.

The reall improvements are on battle game play, finally everything is atually how I would expect it to be. It's little refinements like, how a moving unit is immesurably more vulnerable to arrow fire than a static unit. Battle cohesion and moral play much bigger roles. In rome 2  for instance you could have a quiality unit go full 300 while utterly surrounded and take a good few untis with them just beacuse their base stats are sky high. I'm not sure how the negative bonus is applied in this, but if you are surrounded, you are going down pretty quick.

Overall just the most solid Total War game there is in terms of gameplay (and I include warhammer in that). The only thing I would say it suffers with slightly is the era. As it's a transitional period between Rome and the empires that came after (the dark ages) it's very much play as the vikings before they were viking, play as the Anglo-Saxons before they were English, so a lot of the big name identitys most will know from History just aren't there. The Age of Charlemene DLC moves this along into a better known era, but then this is a far more restrictive campagin (The danes don't even have cav).

90,33163850,english,"i love total war and historical titles of video games in general. i am also a big early middle ages fan and have to say that this time period, fall of the Western Roman Empire is my personal fav to study. ill split this up in pros and cons and also have the historical pros and cons on top then gameplay 

Pros- historical
-Amazing historical accuracy with units
-very good unit and city naming 
-pays attention to many historical details that are small
-DID NOT group the persians up. instead had client states adding better gameplay
-units look very well to the time period. 
-the strongest faction is the eastern romans which makes sense
-could include many small things but i feel they did well on this part
- the buildings are all very fun. each faction has different buildings and you do feel it when playing. and i love the quotes they put in. i think its on a sewer system or something and it says ""I thought they smelled bad on the outside"" 
- the wiki is very well done. it gives you enough info to understand the building or unit as well as not giving you everything so youll want to research it on your own. do that, very fun to find this stuff on your own. 

pros gameplay

MODS 
-MODS again. i felt that the armies rosters were very weak so i got mods that expanded all these. Oh gosh they are so amazing. with unit mods each faction feels sop different and although not historically accurate in some cases they are very fun. i recomend playing with mods
-amazing gameplay map
-very fun battles
-units dont all feel the same
-cav is powerful as youd expect but can be beaten by well trained forces. this is very historically accurate as cav died around this time and didnt come back around till about 600 or 700
- its always fun to use elephants to smash people
- my fav factions to play are Eastern Romans, Aksum, Geats and picts. all very different with mods as well
- that campaign map is very fun. you can see which regions worship what god, the income, growth, natural resources ect 
- its funny, my second fav time period is Charlemagne times and i have to say that DLC is like the base game. really fun but again, mod it. However, youll really like it because its fun to make the Holy Roman Empire, lets face it. 

cons historical
-alright. one thing that pissed me off was that Stilicho is made out to look like an asshole who is corrupt and taking the Rome for himself. so inaccurate. In real life he was right hand man to Theodosius and served at frigidus and many other battlegrounds. He was the reason rome lasted another decade and defeated Alaric the Visigoth on 3 seperate occasions. he was beheaded as a ""Traitor"" later on.
- Slavic Pagan armies will have names like ""Sons ofr Odin"" which is crap
- the Western Roman Empire falls too damn quickly
- on the total war wiki, modders who make units cant make a custom page for them. i understand why but at the same time. i wish they had another way of doing this. like an offline wiki only for that mod because i love reading about the units 

cons gameplay

- Spearmen feel useless 
- without mods, all germanic factions feel the same, all celtic factions feel the same and so on. they are okay and different in campaign mode but not battle.
- OMG western rome falls too damn quick. every faction i play as, by 401 rome is gone. its like a land grab for the first 20 turns then turns into boring petty kingdoms fighting. the fighting between the franks and visigoths should be fun because they both fought each other under clovis but its drawn out and boring
- I know this is supposed to be historically accurate but as the eastern romans, you start off with visigoths in greece and no armies nearby. 6 turns in greece is split between mutiple kingdoms or all destroyed. 
- Persians are too annoying to fight. its the same old battles after a while
- oh my gosh, either the enemy armies bring all spearmen or slingers. 
- in custom battles, choosing a map is so hard. its supposed to let you choose anywhere in asia and europe but i always get hills, deep forest or pits. i just want some damn flat land
- cant unit test and pit 2 units agaisnt each other. you always need a general unit in custom battles
- i was not here for rome 2, but the limit on armies and navies is annoying. 
- have to pay extra money for factions that should have been in the damn game.
- have to pay for blood and gore

ill update this list when i think of stuff. overall i say its a 8.7 out of 10. i found some annoying things but always came back for more. i overall really enjoyed this game and if you like total war im sure youll like this. if new to total war i would not start with this one though because you are thrown into shit right at the start. lastly i say play once un modded then mod. like most games now a days, go mods or go home

The choice is yours and this will be your Epic ""Story"".

If you want to play the Rome of post Gaius-Marius reforms, buy Rome 2, this will not give you that experience. This is set a few hundred years after this time period, which in my opinion makes it a more even playing field if you are wanting to play Factions other than Roman. 

Multiplayer only increases this games appeal to me, being able to bring a good friend along the windy road of Empire building is truly the cherry on the cake of an already fantastic game, And i much recommend this to anyone wanting a decent Co-op experience. Not to mention those wanting PvP Strategy.

Very fluid and intuitive controls in battle, UI can be a little confusing at first if you are used to another TW's UI, but overall very good.

Breath taking graphics for the machines that can put a little more Horsepower through it, i run on medium settings and it's more than acceptable. 

a bit miffed on the DLC's as i think some should have been shipped in the base game, Nonetheless they are worth a grab on sale.

The way to really make this game sing is with Mods! Fantastic modding community and easy execution with Workshop integration for quick and simple mod installation. Just click + Play.

Overall, Delivers exactly what you expect from a Total War game. If you enjoyed the others then this is definitely for you, Just don't go in to it expecting Rome 2 Clone. This game is about the Underdog's of European history... The Tribes, The Religions, The Hun!

43,34790002,english,"Despite not displacing Shogun 2 as the best total war game in my books, Attila combined with its DLC campaigns is really good to the point of competing with the original Rome and Medieval 2.

Something that really stood out to me was the entire Medieval 2 vibe that emerge when you start the game. Like Medieval 2 there's an army walking past in the background on the main menu. Age of Charlemagne further hammers this point in to the point I think it's safe to say this is as close to a Medieval 3 we'll get until the official Medieval 3 is released.

Now, the game has some very serious optimisation issues. I have a fairly beefy computer but the framerate grinds to a halt when more then 2-3k troops participate in a battle. There are also a problem where unit animations become choppy with too many troops on the screen at the same time.
The battles though are excellent with many small touches here and there that brings the battlefield to life. Like the peasants walking about that really doesn't add anything but still is a really nice touch.

The campaign though is where the largest changes have taken place. Some factions start as hordes or can form hordes when chased out of their last province. The hordes wander around looting and raiding in the search for a new and safe homeland. This essentially cuts out what could be tedious campaign gameplay and letting the players focus entirely on the series trademark battles. On the negative side I still can't get behind every army needing a general or the province system. I think Shogun 2 had it perfectly nailed down and Rome 2 tore it all to shreds and for whatever reason Attila has to repeat many of the same mistakes.

Another thing I can't get behind is the skill trees of agents and generals. It doesn't lead me to remember their names and characteristics the way the original Rome did. Agents also feel more useless then ever and I can't recall myself ever thinking that I need anything other then priests to keep the ludicrous barbarian late game public order issues in check.

At least they brought the family tree back. Good on you CA.

This is a very detailed game but poorly optimised.

-Every faction has their own perks.
-Every faction has their own buildings,religion,resource(which you can trade with other factions with who you are friends with)
-Diplomacy (I can't explain it because it bould be longer than the review)
-Every unit has their own look it's personality (axemen,spearmen,swordmen,cavalry,missile units and many ships which depends on faction).
-Every factions has their own tech trees the tech trees the tech trees are civic developments and military developements.

Tips:
-Axemen are universal almost against all units for example axemen vs spearmen axemen win the same with swordmen but against axemen vs axemen there is a 50-50 chance against cavalry the best is spearmen.
-First build up an economy(farms,cultural building or trade with your local neighbours) the money you gained build up an army but don't dismantle your units becuase you might get attacked!
-I recommend newcomers to play on easy first if you complete the campaign on easy you are ready to do campaign(s) on normal.
-The difficulties easy,normal,hard,legendary Easy your economy is stronger than the enmies,moral bonus for your units and so on.normal it's almost like easy the ai is the same but you don't get bonuses,hard is harder a little bit better ai,legendary you can't save just auto save when you click on the next turn button.
-You don't have to go like the history says go and conquer if you feel like it and change history!

""Ah... The Assembly/The Infinite Wardens/Bethesda, the eternal gaming franchise. I have seen the end of days and years from now men will say ""here began the fall of Total War/Creativity/RPG's"". The power of Free Content was taken from the many and given to the few. Those who wore the golden wreath grew sick with every kind of wickedness. They were filled with greed, deceit, and malice. They Betrayed the ones they loved, and subjected them to the horrors of the Alpha-Beta Wastelands as guinea pigs. They did all this and called it: ""Subculturepacks/""Epic and Visceral""/The Creation Kit.""

55,34729856,english,"This is probably the best historical Total War.

Unlike other total war games, this one features very robust strategic view. Each faction starts in very different conditions. New players would be better playing more traditional empire building game as someone like Garamantians - start small, eat other small nations, then take on bigger fish. There are advanced stars as migrating European tribes or Hun horde or defensive crumbling Roman Empire. The world gets worse and worse so you have to be careful with building up your economy. There are some internal politics and family management but it's obscure and doesn't have visible effect on the game.

Combat is supposed to be the most important part of Total War but it's underwhelming. First AI is usually not opportunistic and if you chose your battles well you won't ever need to see battle map: one of the sides will always have an overwhelming advantage. Battles themselves are not that fun: yes, the roster is diverse but even all cavalry Huns are all about hammer & anvil tactics, harrassing enemy with archers and so on. AI doesn't go for anything complex and there are no pre-made scripted battles so every battle is exactly like the others. Maybe it's better in multiplayer, but unlike TW Shogun 2 there's no MP progression mini-game.

The game also have technical problems - runs worse than TW Warhammer. It also doesn't look good. It has lots of nice models but it is not beautiful the way TW Shogun 2 or Napoleon was: those games had specific aesthetic they were going for and music, sound and graphics all worked for it. Attila is schizophrenic: there's an apocalyptic theme here so everything is grim and that's about it. It's like back to 2000's brown shooters.

It may be the best TW game gameplay-wise (at least before Warhammer) but I don't find it that enjoyable after the first campaign. It felt fresh and interesting but starting new one is boring: battles are unfulfilling, internal politics and agents have miniscule effect on a big picture and require too much attention, the spectacle isn't there. Get it if you fan of the era or just want one relatively short and saturated campaign. Only buy DLC when you've played several campaigns in the main game and crave for more, those DLCs add new factions but do not enhance the base game.

Also blood DLC is BS.",1504512214,1504512214,False,6,0,0.532241165637969971,2,True,False,False,76561198043840291,443,65,2387,0,2387,1503498150,,

Pros
Family tree and factions issues, a great addition to the roleplaying, you need to fight to keep your faction from infighting and disloyalty and great little bit of realism, similar to Crusader Kings.
No steam rollering! In the previous Totalwar games you could quite easily steamroller AI, but not now, its added a little more realism to the game.
Lots of different objectives, so its not just point the map your colour - which is refeshing.
Hoard mechanic, a great idea to play as one and to deal with them these act as viruses rampaging around and settling at times.
Its finally a challenge! Play WRE to see what I mean! When you build an empire or defend one it feels like a real achievement.
The graphics, and AI, sound all brilliant!

Cons
Its not easy - lose a settlement or battle and it will hurt your plans.
Not a quick bashathon - if you want to quickly take over Europe look somewhere else.
Naval battles - missed out - a great shame.
Limited armies - there are limits based on your Imperium, which can be annoying if you can afford an army there are times when you cannot raise one - however its a extra challenge!

Overall - a great game - but expect to be spanked from time to time!

Unlike the abberant abomination that was Rome II this game is a magnificent comeback. I forgive you CA. There are a lot of things that CA have improved or introduced that I can bestow praise on but in the interest of brevity it will suffice to say two things. 

Firstly, the difficulty of this game, while not universally appreciated by everyone, is a critical factor in my personal enjoyment. 

Secondly, is the improvement of the campaign and battle A.I., while not without flaws, has improved by many degrees. Anyone who has done a Game Programming or Artificial Intelligence 101 course at university can appreciate the difficulty of making expert systems for a game of this scope.

My main criticism of this game is directed at two things. 

Firstly, the ingame encyclopedia was a terrible idea. This is clearly a product of over-engineering a simple problem or a design-by-committee idea or both. GET RID OF THIS ABOMINATION.

Lastly, is substandard quality of the flavour text that ingame (i.e. details with anecdotes, history and amusing prose about units, buildings and technology). Did CA fire the professor that did this for Empire: Total War, and Rome I? Please re-hire this gentleman scholar dude because he was awesome (and educational and interesting and amusing).

In Rome II there were the greeks with spears, nomads with horses, romans, carthaginians, germans, celts, iberians, etc. However, what happened in Attila is that there are hoards of copy and pasted germanic tribes. What CA should have done is what they did with the two halves of the roman empire, having some shared units and some unique ones, not a shared army and one unique one. Also, unrelated, the huns, a nomadic horse based faction, have terrible cavalry but one of the best infantry units. Meanwhile, the romans who could not ride a horse have lots of good cavaly like cataphracts. Despite this ramble here, I still found myself lunging hours of life into this game.

First off played this game for a good hour before asking for a refund. 2nd It runs great, but a tad bit choppy or lagging. I can pull either a performance to quality settings on this and still playable. Having said that still isn't giving me that very smooth FPS. I've got used to playing this game back when I had an Alienware setup. No Mac / PC flames here. This Mac is not a gaming laptop BUT my work laptop. I just tried to install nostalgic games I used to play. 

FYI I haven't tried to play massive battles on this and have no Idea if it will ever crash on me on the long run. If you have same specs as I have It's definitely playable at a minimum. I you set the recommended quality it would push you to ""Max Performance"" setting automatically. Even at that setting it won't be anywhere near as good as PC gaming. With my specs I can still get away with half that. Again that's because this game was never properly optimized for OSx as CA claimed to be playable. 

I would still this grab this game in the future for Seven Kingdoms mod once GOT(game of Thrones) seasons are over. Also once it's stable enough and installable for that mod on latest versions. For now I can only see v 4.5 for Mac. Over all this game is far more better overhaul from older Total War series. Actually I'm going to grab this once this game is ON SALE for $11. So if you have near specs as I have put this on your wish list or cart to notify you once this game goes on sale. Check Steams price history for this game cause the price dips to $11 3-4 times a year.

18,17425946,english,"So, after a 2 years i decided to change my Review from positive to Negative. 

Its not like i dont like TW:Attila, its not like its a BAD game.... its just lost potential and broken promise of trully epic gameplay. TW:Attila still remains one of my favorite total war games, somewhere at 3rd place after Shogun 2 and first Rome, regardless to all problems with this game what i did encounter.

Lets do it proper way with pros and cons list

--------------PROS:--------------

- Graphically one of best historical TW games, Art assets are only better in Shogun 2 in my opinion. Loading screens, map and city designs looks very pleasant for eyes and soul

- Audio is definitely on top level. It surpass most of TW games.... except shogun 2. However here i would point, that for me Medieval 2 had best audio. 

- Optimisation is better than in last TW games, however more about it in cons

-  Major DLC Campaigns are actually worth their price... mostly. both Age of Charlemagne and The Last Roman are very epic and challenging extensions, even for TW veterans like me. 

- Game design actually fits historical period. Game is quite... dark and brutal. 

- Game can bring loads of fun and plenty hours of gameplay even without DLCs, Most of mine i got in later stages

- Achievements are actually hard to get, and are not bound to progress in story lines or doing simple tasks. 

-Multiplayer didnt get worst than it is in Rome 2, and MP in Rome 2 got better after endless patches.

- Battles are actually quite satysfying, and being more tactical player,  ""CTRL+A, SEND THEM ALL"" way of playing will lead you to loosing battle even if you outnumber the enemy.

- Diplomacy is almost as good as in Shogun 2.... -

- Building cities, and upgrading them require strategical planing for 200-500 turns ahead. Region system and public order is well planed for me. Every building have its purpose, pros and cons and importance. You need to ballance your regions and their specializations in order to run effective economy in later stages of game. 

- Mod friendly

-------------CONS:------------

-  DLC POLICY, DLC PRICE TO CONTENT RATIO, AMOUNT OF DLCs, 

- Optimization and performance. there will be sub-points:
a) Game shutter and get FPS drops even on hardware which should be capable to run it easily. 
b) Even if game start to shutter and have FPS drops, none of components are actually under heavy load. Due typical battle i get between 20 and 60 FPS, while my CPU is used in no more than 60%, and GPU is at 50% load. From 8 GB of ram game dont take more than 3. So its engine issue, which cant use properly avilible resources
c) Preformance issues are mostly linked to number of units on field. setting lower unit size and decreasing terrain detail on medium or below (causing bodies and blood to dissapear) mostly will fix issues with shuttering
d) Battles are way better optimised (less drops, less shutter) in capital cities (o_O), and generaly in Campgains. Custom SP battles with more than 4k units on field can be unplayable in some moments

- Game gets more simple, than it used to be. For some people it can be counted as Pros, because old total wars could give a headache to many casual players. 

- After so many years on same engine, AI is still kinda stupid. Its better than in most of games except shogun 2, however, its unworthy, boring and time wasting to playing this game on lower dificulty level than Hard. 

- Difficulty level NPC cheating. Instead of making AI more complex, AI gets more gold, and shorter training time + unit boosts. On Very hard you are just flooded with 9lvl agents who preform COSTFUL IN GOLD FOR YOU actions every turn, Artillery gets sniper abilities, NPC armies can travel longer. 

- To be honest vanilla game gets boring and annoying after 20 hours. To make gameplay better, i needed to download multiple mods, including changing colors of units in factions, battle rebalance to fix super short ranged unit range, fix armor and impact damage, which almost not exist for cavalary, and shields or armor literally do not give protection from ranged attacks. In the meanwhile archers are useless, and slingers can devastate heavy armored top tier unit in testudo/shield wall mode..... Without adding any new content i needed 9 mods to reballance gameplay... mostly on battlefields.

-Animations:
a) So, where da f.k are thoose vomiting and wounded soldiers, crawling in agony on battlefields? i didnt seen even single vomiting soldier, even if they are in Blood dlc trailer. 
b) why general's mouth remain closed, even if he is the middle of speech towards soldiers? What about squad leaders, captains, simple soldiers etc... you can hear them, you cant see them talking. we had it in shogun 2, and Rome 2 first trailer with Carthago siege... never after that. Animations get stripped, and we got speachless soldeirs with glued mouths. 
c) this faces... they was differend on trailers and in all what devs said... they supposed to have feelings, they have not. We been promised ""human"" soldiers on field... we didnt get it....
d) combat animations still not great. Can be partly fixed with mods....

- Grand Campgain turns takes literally AGES. Wihle 8c/8t 4ghz CPU is used in 30%.... I understand there is almost hunderd of nations... but most of them are small

- turn based map Faction AI in meaning of territorial control is crap. There is milions of super-small cities-states, and almost none of large kingdoms. Without mod AI wont recolonize burned/sacked cities. It will remain ruin until you wont rebuild it. After Hunic invasion there remains wasteland with single color spots in form of city-state.

- from siege engines we have small and large catapult. Nothing else. Oh, and scorpion/polybos, which are not exactly useful, if not mounted on walls

- Walls, gates and Towers of cities are paper. they crumble and fall so quick, that sieges always end in streets. Again, Without mods forget to see epic sieges with siege towers, ladders, Rams and fighting for every inch of battlements 

--last words--

After having game on same engine like 5-6 times in a row, working on exactly same principles, there is no improvement in issues, what are a pain in TW games from ages. Both Rome 2 and Attila, even if are great games, giving fun for many hours, are big step back from what we had in Shogun 2, or even in Medieval 2. My opinion is, that TW:Attila is good Tw game, not perfect, but good one. i would give it 7 out of 10, however, not for current price with all DLCs. Wait for discount, get it then. And be prepared, that you wont enjoy 1080p ultra details and 10k units on field with stable 60 FPS. Only very short range of PC hardware can run this game smooth all the time, and it possibly will be same hardware, what been used for CA beta tests in studio.",1438936362,1502313719,False,0,0,0.497510433197021484,0,True,False,False,76561197999118670,86,34,21957,5,14455,1601928212,,

22,34014879,english,"Most of Total War games are generic and don't offer much new and this is one of them so I am going to compare it with other Total War games. 

Firstly positives, this game has some unique mechanics which are quite interesting. Previously once you lose every city the game is over here, however, if you have any units left (army) you become a horde essentially a government without any cities. Secondly, once you've captured the city you can completely destroy it (raze) which means if you find a razed city you can settle there. At the start of the campaign, there are some blank spots on the map so you can conquer new provinces without invading a foreign country. Also, there are lots of nation which have different difficulties to play, so this game can provide potentially hundreds of hours of gameplay as each campaign takes around [u]10-15 hours[/u] to complete.

Now it's time to talk about negatives. The biggest one I found is horrible starting menu. Actually even before that game has a launcher which is insanely small and cramped. Main menu buttons are small and located on the side so I didn't like that either. Finally, you can't upgrade units often which is a small negative but still. They gain upgraded equipment and exp like in 'Total War: Rome' thought.

33,33913677,english,"This might be lengthy, but I'll do my best.

I've played every Total War game ever.  Ever. I still have the Shogun 1/Medieval 1 disks in my desk. 

This is by far, *by far*, the most frusterating Total War released.  I'm not sure how I feel about that, perhaps it's something I could speak to my psyciatrist about...anyways.

It's based on the Rome 2 engine and system, with many changes in gameplay and how things generally work.  It's basically a giant mod of the origional structure.  There is lots of variation, with each culture being generally well fleshed out.  Aside from the DLC qualms everyone complains about, the unit variation is solid, as are the tech trees.  This is prob my favorite part of this release, as it seems that every time I run a playthrough, it's completely different each time.  I haven't found that in other Total War titles.  

On to the frusterating parts, and really the big parts of this game.

It's called Attila because of Attila the Hun.  No ****, right? Go figure.  And go figure, **** the Huns.  **** them.

They're incorperated into the game in a way that can make it impossible to win.  In fact, amongst the group I play with, not one of us has successfully completed a campaign, but only stopped and started a new one once it became stale.  

The AI cheats like no other, with full 0 upkeep stacks of Hunnic Horse Archers spawning who mercilessly mow your troops down with near infinite arrows, as you're left helpless sitting in a ******* field in close order shield formation, just waiting for death.  Thousands of high tier infantry and whoever else just lost in a heartbeat.  Can't charge, can't hold, just have to pray they run out of arrows and charge you, in which you're probably still royally *******. 

While I'm on about armies...the AI movement is bonkers.  Sometimes they stay just outside of your own armies range, as the AI knows exactly how far you can move and try to engage.  That can get very annoying.

The sanitation, public order and food system is far from perfect, with values swinging wildly from turn to turn.  One turn you have 120 food, the next turn you have -10 and horrible plagues ravaging two of your cities.  I'm very tempted to look up a workshop fix for this, but I feel I shouldn't, as the final product *should* have this already taken care of.  Some buildings add onto the Squalor value so harshly, it doesn't make much sense.  Want to build a basketmaker?  Too bad! The citizens are pissed and are going to go **** in the streets, they're SO pissed!   **** that basketmaker!

Because this game is so challenging, and the other Total Wars, after some time, have been a complete compstomp by late game once you get the hang of it, it's actually quite refresing in a sort of sick, self hating kind of way.  I do recommend it, but truly not for the faint of heart.",1501447464,1501447464,True,1,0,0.506578981876373291,0,True,False,False,76561197995205600,224,2,51527,0,10977,1578139975,,

the game looks nice and should be fun to play...but i give a low low review of the developers and publishers as no professional company should put out something so pathetically un-optimized as this game.

1) Advisor gets stuck. You do what is asked but for whatever reason the game doesn't count it and you can't do it over. Essentially game ending.

2) Rebels are supposed to sack a city that you can then capture. Except every single one of the rebels failed. Can't declare war in the prologue, game is stuck. Also game ending.

3) Randomly the End Turn button greys out despite all requirements from the advisor being met. Similar to first issue. Forces you to leave and come back to a previous save. Can result in moderate progress lost. Probably 10 or so minutes if you're not spam saving.

4) (Only happened once) but the game crashed when switching to my turn from the AI. No error message just ""not responding"".  specs: i7 6700, 1060 GeForce GTX,  16gb ram, 250gb ssd, Win 10

This could be very good game but Huns.....If u play a europan fraction, u will not be able to defeat Huns. As AI, they have unlimited resources. After u defeat many hordes, two times more hordes will appear again and even stronger. I had found advise on forum that only way to stop them is to kill Attila. After that i have send 3 spies to found him and all my champions were killing his commanders (i hoped when i kill many of them, he will have to use Attila as comander). Attila haven´t appear yet even i had killed more than 10 Hunnic generals by agents and more than 10 during battles. Still nothing, my spies found nothing too. Attila was addult, so he had to be there.

This game has much more better battle campaign map than ROME II. AI attacks enemy even far away. AI don´t attack fortified settlements without siege weapons (u must invest if u have not). Cavalry is perfect but AI sometimes send it against phalangs but on the wings AI can move with cavalry very well.
Sometimes Ostrogoths settle in Itali, Visigoths in Spain and Vandals in Africa. This historical reflection is good, but it is that, what makes Huns so OP.

This is from the perspective of a total war fan who has had every game in the series and upgraded computers soley to be able to play the latest total war release.

You'll have more fun playing the first Rome, and its expansion, accompanied by a great deal of mods. which brings up another massive failling of the newer total war games: lack of in depth mod support. Sure you can get new flags, new units and such from the workshop, but the campaign map and its mechanics can't be modified. I had bought this in anticipation of playing the middle earth mod in development, but when i learned that such a mod would never have a fully realized campaign like the awesome Third Age mod for Medieval 2, I returned it.

The DLCs are a bunch of cash grabs for the most part, contrasting with the excellent expansions of past total war games, that added tons of content, usually in a stand alone package. (This is really a direct sequal to the barbarian invasion expansion for Rome 1, but it falls far behind that title in content, playable factions, and a fun battle system.)

This game was overated.

By that I mean, that while great, it's not the savior everyone thought it would be.

Surely it's better than Rome 2, but even Minesweeper is, the problem with Attila is that just as Napoleon , it didn't really have a bar to surpass since the previous game was absolute garbage.

What's great is the battle system, it's not Medieval 2 good, but it's there. The difficulty is great too but that's where the problem comes.

Why is it hard? , mostly because of some mechanics they use to prolonge the campaign time, this game REALLY punishes fast expansion, even if you've been turtling for a while forget about taking more than 1 region (3 provinces) in a turn , and you have to leave your stacks there for a few turns after, wherass the AI of corse can do whatever the fuck it pleases and it will probably send 5 stacks against you every turn, which kinda sucks, I'd like them to at least pretend to be surviving, this also punishes expansion, and makes 80% of the game battles siege defenses against the AI in a minor town, which quickly get reppetitive. Oh, and that will be like 60 hours of play if you want to even finish one campaign.

This is the problem with this game, while ""hard"" it is not fun hard like Shogun 2 legendary or Warhammer legendary, it's just feels like a tedious grind, and while that can be fun for 1 or maybe even 2 campaigns, it quickly kills replay value.

It may be weird as first, as their s zero political map while you are doing actions, so it is kinda hard to tell where your borders are, but theirs a map in the bottom right to help a bit. Other then that, the mass battles are fun, the campaign are actually not bad DLC and the factions you buy are not terrible, but only buy them if you really want to or theirs a sale, as they still appear in game, the DLC just makes it so you can play them.

    The only real downside of the game is how expensive it is off sale, bought for only 12 or so dollars on the summer sale, but 45 almost off sale. Also, how long some turns can take. Although so far they seem to be quicker in the campaigns, likely because of less nations, it can take a while main campaign for the bigger countries and oddly the smaller ones can take a while.

It has proven once again that CA is only able to properly deliver a faction campaign total war game versus a grand campaign total war game.

Atilla was what rome 2 should have been as it was more focus on the gameplay rather than having a large diversified factions and units in game and forfeit gameplay.

AI was much better than rome 2, but still could be further improved and note that there is no perfect AI out there as many games struggle to create a competent AI against complex human. This involved heavy scripting which affects the performance of the game and will not be adaptable to situations. What current gamers need right now is new learning AI algorithm which can adapt to the playstyle of the gamers which hopefully will be better in the next few years.

23,33140611,english,"As you can see from the hours played, I had and have a lot of fun with Attila. So far it's the best Total War (and I have played about all of them and I have played them a lot). 

The gameplay differs a lot from culture to culture with each faction facing different challenges and having very different means to meet them, not only when it comes to the obvious things like what kind of army each faction can field, but also when it comes to the ""little things"" like ... whether you even have settlements or start as a horde. Or public order. Or politics. Or economy. Or religion. All this forces you to adapt your strategy, not only to your own capabilites, but also to what your enemy can and cannot do. (Because of that some of the Culture-DLCs are actually worth it and not just another starting position, especially the sandy one. Celts and Norse are meh tho, just more barbarians).
Every aspect of the game actually impacts how well you're doing - as opposed to Rome II where you could just ignore politics and be fine and public order and culture usually were no big deal (just build a big enough temple, eh?). Attila is actually challenging without feeling outright unfair, like Shogun did, where ""challenge"" meant the AI cheated and everyone - even your closest allies - just decided to go to war with you for no apparent reason, once you became somewhat powerful.
Also the setting is interesting and they did a lot to make it feel right and that's not just how it looks, but again, how it plays: For example, you get, why abandoning Britain as the Romans is a sensible idea. And you get, why you should migrate your barbarian tribe to the south. Not because it's historically accurate, but because it's a reasonable answer to what the game puts infront of you and how the setting translates into gameplay, starting positions and Huns wanting to burn your babies.

TL;DR:

Saving Rome is hard, but fun. But so is conquering (parts of) it to make your own Frankish Kingdom. And defending that against the Huns. And putting everything to the torch as the Huns. And building up your power and then steamroll everything as the Sassanides. And building up your power to backstab the Sassanides as some jewish desert Kingdom (DLC).
Also it's pretty to watch the world burn.

The only thing that disappointed me is that you do not get to make Rome proper pagan again. Just this Sol Invictus crap.

I also came across the general or units that arn't the spies,diplomats or veteran trainers don't show on the game..its as if they are ghosts running around with a pole....and for some odd reason the diplomet or spy can't join the army.. another aspect however small choosing fo the standard..you can't really see what standard your choosing until you exit then zoom in to check.

So far the game is still pretty fun to play diplomacy, wrecking cities to dust, i just found those few things abit frustrating and hope there will be a update or another coming soon.

Attila is amazing on its own. It has the best campaign since Shogun 2, with that it also has one of the hardest campaigns I have played in a total war if you play as vanilla WRE, amazingly difficult and a great challenge. The horde mechanic is new in Attila and the family tree works slightly better than it does in Rome 2. The horde mechanic works well and adds a whole new level of roleplay/style of play if you decide to be a murderous horde rampaging across the world burning everything in your path.

Attila is much 'darker' than previous war titles since it is set in a period when stuff mostly just got burned down. They nailed the 'dark' feeling and touch.

Attila isn't a nostalgia grab like Rome 2 was. Rome 2 is Rome 1...with slightly better graphics and a bit better mechanics than the first. Rome 2 is nothing impressive or new.

First off the good. The game is pretty, gritty, but visually impressive. The political tree is there, and if you like playing a political struggle along part of managing an empire that is a factor. What you make your people do affects their traits, and rivals exist, so there is a lot of depth. The whole game has a feeling of winding down, and the world is falling apart, so you do get a feeling of fighting an inevitable decline (which I personally like). Usually with Total War games you bulid up an invincible center empire, expand using divide and conquer, and you are only really threatened at the beginning or by a multifront war, but this is quite different.

The bad. There are a lot of balance issues, cavalry is overpowered, the single player campaign is about as stable as Caligula. The visuals look very ""samey"" for lack of a better term. The game gets stale once Attila is half way through his lifetime (historically), because the Hunnic faction has razed most of the map and you're left fighting them over the ashes of Europe. The AI will also spam doomstacks, massive armies of top tier units the Huns get for free, and will send against your cities so you can do nothing but sit and defend. This is where it becomes unfun, and that really is a shame.

Don't be discouraged by the DLC ""policy"", as the game is totally fine even without them, and the amount of DLC and the ratio of content to price is nowhere near as horrendous as Rome2 or Warhammer anyway.  

As for historical accuracy, well it's not accurate at all-but it's nothing new to anyone who has ever played a total war game before. The core of the gameplay is strategy and battles, and Atilla shines in both these aspects. The AI is decent, the strategic map is huge and full of cities, points of interest and events that make the gameplay all the more interesting-forget the empty maps of certain previous titles where the gameplay revoloved around baically moving your armies from one city to another and say hello to guarding moutain passages and setting ambushes in forests!

The Bad
- Dimplomacy: Very simplistic, your only real options are to declare war and make alliances, could never seem to get trade deals with the AI
--- Campaign AI: Never before have I had uninstall a Total War game after just 7 hours of playing it, but the campaign AI in Attila makes this game unplayable. I've had armies at the top of the map in scotland sail all the way down to the bottom in africa just to attack my only undefended provinces. I've had factions across the map declare war on me for no apparent reason and then march their forces halfway across the map (even though they were at war with their neighbors). Not to mention that even on normal difficulty the AI cheats like crazy.

The campaign AI makes this game unplayable as anything but a custum battle simulator. Even buying it on sale is not worth it.",1498612855,1498612855,False,2,1,0.454016298055648804,0,True,False,False,76561198007009290,157,2,1064,0,432.0,1558917436,,

Well, the use of Sun Tzu in that game or in Attila is a joke.

I hope the devs pick up the book and not just read it but give it a thorough study.

Rome total war 2 was amaizing. Was expecting same or better from this game, but just dont like it no metter how hard I try...

The game itself feels like early access version, with almost same graphics as Rome 2 it runs a lot worse. A lot of bugs. 
Even thought units get tierd faster, combat fees fast and chaotic. Units run in heavy armour like sprinters... Nothing saves from javelins - no armour, no shield, even shield wall with heavy armour together. Just spam javelins and you will win almost any battle.  Ranged units will shoot friedlies in the back unless you micro manage them all the time. enemy-frieds -your arches dont care...
Naval combat feels even more chaotic. Ships just crash into each other and their crew engage in melee. But the way the do it is so weird... They will make enemy crew rout, then jump back to their own ship while enemy just goes away, then rallies and comes back... 
Even if AI has bigger army it will usually attack with small amount of troops at a time, starting with general...

19,32150108,english,"Despite what people say about this quality of this game compared to that of Medieval 2 or the first Rome Total War games; this game is still an excellent game in my opinion.

Good things about this game:
1: This game has an amazing cinimatic quality unique to itself, and if you get the Olympium battle camera mod, go into cinimatic mode and just watch as you get slaughtered - It's amazing.
2: The graphics on this game are on spot, and really brings the world to life. The animations are smooth, the fights are amazing.
3: You can have some pretty large scale battles, and watching the long lines of infantry collide is something else :D
4: What I've always appreciated about the historical Total War titles, is the accuracy that it has. It may not be dead on but they did an excellent job on making it real.
5: Despite what people say, this game is amazingly optimized. The fact that you can have roughly 8000 Units on the field without extreme choppy framerate is amazing. If you think about it, each soldier has individual animations, and each unit has individual AI targets. The details on the textures and the graphics in general aswell. To manage all this and still get solid fps is amazing in my opinion.

Bad things about this game:
1: Well the first thing you'll see a lot of people get angry about is the DLC plan the company has, if you're going to buy this game - be prepared to get out some money for the blood and gore, and other key factions.
2: One thing to note is the poor way they went around seiges in this game, and its pretty clunky compared to other titles such as Medieval 2. For example many Attila players will say that the towers are OP, and they are definitely. O-P
3: Daft AI, expecially in seiges. I've had many a times when I'm playing singleplayer and the AI cant seem to find its way through the walls, they just run around outside tiring their troops out. So now I, the defender have to go out and attack them which is odd to say the least.
4: This game is a lot like the previous title, Rome 2. Some might even argue they copies a lot of assets from the previous title. I personally have only played Rome 2 on someone elses computer, and I find Attila to have its own unique charm. However just know if you own Rome 2 and put a lot of hours into it - this game might seem copied to that.

Hope this was insightful, if you plan to buy this game - It is a really good game and no one will think its stupid.

27,32032558,english,"This is a massive step in the right direction for the Total War series. If there were any problems on release, I'd say that this game has been patched perfectly since then.

Pros:

Having played Rome, Medieval 2, Shogun 2, Rome 2, and even Total War: Warhammer - I can say that Attila really feels responsive, thorough, and is now one of my favourite games in the series.

The AI is intelligent, the battles feel more chaotic and more challenging, graphics are great, and the two best parts in my opinion are:

1. An ally in good standing will actively assist you in war efforts, defensive and offensive. I was actually surprised by how ""realistically"" this happens, depending on the circumstance. I literally had my ass saved by allies at least twice, when I was in the deep end. They even take advantage of the ""war-coordination"" feature which was also present in Rome 2.

2. The diplomatics are great, with noticeable consequences. Apart from the ""normal"" diplomatic screen, there is also ""in-clan"" diplomatics, where different houses strive for power. This adds a lot of personality to the game.

3. Virtually bug-free as far as I can tell, just finished my first campaign, and there wasn't anything that angered me regarding bugs.

Cons:

As a the units of that time period looked quite similar for all the factions (at least the europeans- whole lotta leather and mail- similar shields etc.) it can sometimes be hard to tell who is who, when zoomed in a bit. Not a big deal though, as every unit has a unit-marker. Though in my opinion, the old system with banners was neater, and more intuitive.

The interface on the campaign map can be confusing at first, when it comes to using the more intricate functions of the diplomatics, but you get used to it rather quickly.

Playing on ultra-graphic settings, the game will have a tendency to have frame drops when large battles take place. This can be remedied by lowering certain settings (experiment with this one).

All in all a game well worth the dosh. Even though there is some DLC, the game feels complete without it.",1496020479,1496020479,True,23,0,0.714335858821868896,1,True,False,False,76561197972021646,159,13,4481,0,1897,1579006036,,

Broken Units, insanely unbalanced, worse fucking AI then in Rome 2, CA completely abandoned it and refuse to put out any more patches to fix bugs and game balance breaking issues. Campaign is a giant fuck you made of artificial difficulty and infinitely spawning stacks with an AI that prioritizes you from across the known world despite being at war with a neighbor. Game is fucking unbalanced trash. Do yourself a favor and don't get it, what ever little improvements they made to the game from previous versions they ruined everything else in game play factor for it, people shit on Rome 2 but at least Rome 2's units were balanced, in Attila there is no unit balance to be found, some factions are utterly worthless for no good reason to (Western Rome for instance has the weakest infantry, cavalry & skirmishers of all the factions when historically they were still a major force to be reckoned with) And without mods the AI will fill its armies with 50% ranged & cavalry spam (which with ai mass coordinating all those moves/skirmishers means nothing but fucking obnoxious headaches)

Oh and theres also super messed up traits for the generals, basically any action you do other then releasing troops will get your emperor super huge negative penalties and the more battles your generals win the more shitty traits they get that lower morale/other factors as if to penalize you for no reason for winning your battles in campaign.

Long story short Attila is bottom trash game for Total War, devs totally abandoned it and wont even fix a thing which pretty clearly supports the fact they went ""To much trouble to bother to fix"" Add in the fact that the retarded devs made the game into poorly optimized shit and once again abandoned it mean the game will forever chug away going from 15 to 60 fps at random, and i really really hope you enjoy blatantly insane attack/defense/morale boost to the AI on any difficulty above hard.

However, just like how Napoleon Total War is leagues better than Empire Total War, Attila is incredible compared to Rome 2.

I could point out the significantly better graphics, way more challenging and brutal gameplay, more unit diversity, better balancing, family trees, or countless other things.

Instead, I'll just focus on what I think is the best part about Attila.

The sieges are incredibly fun. The map design for sieges in this are just amazing on every level. Sieges are not some turtle-fest but rather dynamic battles where you fight across great chokepoints and defensive locations. Especially when you combine it with the simultaneous naval invasions, it's not only incredibly fun to play, but fun to watch as well. I've never wanted to fight sieges in any Total War more than in this one, and I've played every single Total War there is. Having a multi-stage siege battle where your naval forces first clear a way through the enemy navy, before you deploy the artillery ships to bombard the land forces. Then having your invasion fleet move up to dock troops (transport ships now leave the map after they drop their troops, another massive change from Rome 2).

At the same time your second reinforcing army advances up the Southern approach. The enemy AI has sallied forth to meet them and they outnumber that army 2 to 1, making you fight a retreat as you're outmatched. Using this advantage, your invasion fleet rushes up to capture key points in the town and to prepare and engage the AI as they return back to town. Now the tables have turned and your invasion has become a defense, but the town itself is burning all around you due to your artillery ships.

Such a battle was ridiculously rare if not almost impossible to get in Rome 2. Here it's basically how it happens all the time on V. Hard and above difficulty. Just so much fun. There's always something interesting and challenging happening when it comes to sieges.

Not to mention the AI is really aggressive in this, so you will be defending in sieges very often. The AI will come from land and sea too, giving you those great naval invasions.

From the game crashing to now two of the three TW games I have not even starting up.
I have Rome 2, Attila and Warhammer.

And as I said before ""Murffies Law"" the only one working is Warhammer and that is the one I enjoy the least.

What upsets me the most is I am lost in trying to sort this out. I have got advice from other players of whom I am grateful too for trying to help me resolve this issue. I have also found other players with the same problems. 

If the game does not work then surely I am not asking to much if I want a refund. Don't get me wrong it KILLS me to ask for one because I really do enjoy these games so much. It's my down time, my brain gets to relax and consentrate on just taking over the world.

If there is anyone who may be able to shed light on the situation I would be forever grateful. If not then wish me luck on getting my refund.

83,31170318,english,"I say I recommend this because this is overall a good game in a franchise the likes of which are few and far between. A new total war player, I have no doubt, will be astonished by the sheer scale of the battles and the mods that make them bigger. However, I have a lot of problems with this game, as a person who started with Med 2 and played all the games from Med 1 - Attila. Before I get into that, I do want to talk about where this game goes right.

Hordes - A comeback from Rome 1 that was built heavily upon. If you weren't playing as one of the two halves of the Roman Empire, you likely will play as a faction that starts off as a horde or one that can become a horde. Hordes in Attila are basically a breed of city and army. You construct buildings with money and population surpluses and develop troops to keep it intact. If the army is destroyed, you lose EVERY building in it, dealing a blow to your economy ( or helping it if that horde wasn't contributing to the economy much in the first place) This adds an entirely new way to play Total War, and I found it quite refreshing

Civil War, Family, Characters, and Integrity - This can now happen at any time unlike Rome 2 from what I understand (I didn't get that far in Rome 2 yet). if a character's loyalty falls to 0, he will defect and take part of your army with him and form a new faction. If an army's integrity (the new equivalent of public order for armies and navies) falls to 0, part of it will defect, elect a leader, and form a new faction. This can happen several times in a campaign and is logical in its causation. Also, Family tree is back.

Atmosphere - It looks like CA really worked to get the feeling of apocalypse, fire, and death into the game. Fire looks friggin awesome, especially at night. Settlements can be set on fire and deal a blow to the defender's morale (and combat skills for some reason...why?) Civilians appear on the battle map, ready for the slaughter. The music, while still not as good as it was in Rome, Med 2, and Napoleon imo, does have that apocalypic, depressed vibe to it, especially in the campaign map. You can now raze regions to the ground, burning all traces of civilation and leaving nothing but ruins for someone else to colonize.

Now for where the game falls short...

Optimization: Frame rates drop catastrophically in certain situations, mostly in battles, but on the campaign map, the camera enters sudden bursts of movement when I scroll across the map. In battles, if the number of troops goes too high, the game speed will drop horribly. I have been forced to play 4 hour long battles that I knew I could win on the map but couldn't get a victory via autoresolve, and on one occasion, I had to quit the battle because each in-game second lasted 12 SECONDS in real time. I don't have that kind of time lying around all the time, and I sure as hell hate dedicating four hours to a battle with a one hour time constraint. Some of the grandest battles I have played in this game were ruined by game speed drops like this. Granted, this was largely because I had a 4x unit size mod, but I never had that big an issue in similar mods in Rome 2. It's the worst in terms of optimization in this franchise after all the patchwork.

The Damn AI - When you talk Total War, you're always going to talk about its consistently bad AI. But I found Attila's a special degree of stupidity. As the Huns, I was attacked next to the Black Sea several times by factions with 1-4 regions from halfway across the continent. Factions with their own homelands to defend will go completely out of their way to relentlessly play cat and mouse with your highly mobile hordes for some reason. If you're not playing as the Huns, they get a special little cheat going their way that consistently spawns full stack armies from thin air just outside your borders if they decide to attack you. As a Roman faction, I don't know how much of a problem that will be (I'm not that far yet), but as a small fry next to their spawn location, it's absolutely ridiculous to be able to pound army after army into submission before their infinite hordes eventually overtake my limited armies and economy before Attila is even born!
Enemies are suicidal in battle, always charging their entire army, sometimes including their missile units, into the front of my defensive testudos to get demolished by a hail of arrows and cavalry charges in the back. I have won battles in which I was outnumbered 4-1 this way. In the Last Roman as the Roman Expedition, I conquered half of Africa and reclaimed it for the Roman Empire. They send nothing from their Balkans despite having 8 armies on standby there. That was likely because they were at war with the Ostrogoths who controlled Italy. So I abandon Africa once i destroy the Vandals and move to assist in Italy. The Berbers declare war on us during my evacuation. Rome does nothing as its armies sweep across its new, undefended territory. By the time they mop up the last Roman presence in Africa, I'm bogged down next to Rome. the Berbers take Sicily after minimal Roman resistance and then began to take territory in the Peninsula. I should remind you that the bulk of the Roman Empire's army is still in the Balkans, with one army patrolling the southern tip of Italy, where they are not needed... As you can probably imagine, I was more than a little pissed off at Rome, and declared independence despite my initial decision in the beginning to remain dutifully loyal to the Emperor and reserve a separate Separatist campaign afterward. Just to give you an idea of why the AI issue must be addressed by CA

Capture points: The system is still as questionable as it was in Rome 2. If 2 men from 2 different enemy units stands on a capture point, they will capture it in spite of the 160 men in one of my units that is standing in its entirety on it. Tower placement is sometimes ridiculous, placing the capture point in such a way that the attacker can capture it by rushing a horde of units into a defending unit standing in front of the point. Sometimes, the capture point is on an undefendable point. A routing unit can capture. A riderless horse can capture!

Naval battles - I like that melee ships are used only for boarding, and ramming ships should only be used to ram, as well as te fact that armies at sea suffer a melee penalty from seasickness, but sometimes, the bugs and AI make the whole thing seem pointless. First, the AI doesn't build much of a navy. Transport ships, for the most part, seem legit enough to it, I guess? At least they're not OP. Sometimes, a man will spawn floating in the water, and for some reason, my artillery ships think its a good idea to target that man instead of the ship he's supposed to be on.

Diplomacy: Seriously, wtf does the AI have against trade agreements. Sometimes it makes sense in the context that they don't want help those they hate, but when a trade agreement will bring the AI 3000 talents, there should be no reason not to accept it, especially if they have even a slightly positive attitude toward me. You can extort the system by demanding payment of what sometimes ends up in the thousands for trade agreements or nonaggression pacts. The ERE dissolved the alliance between him and me (the WRE) on turn 1.

In conclusion, I am saddened by what looked like CA's apology for Rome 2's release. The features it brought to the table: the fire and horde mechanics, the thought of starting as a vast empire beset by countless issues, and from there watching as my land crumbles until a desperate last stand comes to naught as the vast hordes kill every last soldier, kills every great general that rises to meet them, burns every last building in every last settlement - I guess I was naive to think that kind of quality.

This game has its great moments, and new players will still be amazed.

2,30876139,english,"   Okay now just to get this started, I did and sometimes still do play this game quite often, why, well lets talk about that. I don't play it for the great game that CA made, no, I play this for the mods it has, really good mods save this game for me. When I bought this I was thinking I'd try it maybe it's good, the only other thing I was considering buying was Shogun 2, which I had before (not on steam), but don't currently have. I was wrong, this game's grand campaign is quite boring for me, and to let you realize how, on strategy games like Stronghold and Battle for Middle Earth, I am the turtle player (you however won't beat me without proper siege). So for strategy games I play defensively and react to situations as they happen, doing this in Shogun 2 was really fun and necessary, here though it's boring.

   The ai will come at you quickly with half to full stacks, but beating them back is more a chore than anything else, only time you feel threatened is when they attack an unguarded settlement (which they will do a lot, if they can, but on base game, they basically just become annoying as they attack a settlement time and time again without taking it or destroying it). The combat ai is done fairly well, but that's well as in they know how best to charge you, they care little for skirmishing in sieges, they make a path into your settlement (wither that be with artillery, ladders, or rams), then charge in. When on the defensive unless they outnumber you on a minor settlement (in which case they may charge you), they sit around in defensive positions, so if you have missile superiority you can just pick them off without much worry.

   Now some of the grand campaign mechanics aren't that great, and the few that are good, may be a bit off. Example the fertility system, it's a nice system, makes end game harder, but some issues with it. One most of the regions become infertile by the end, and so I think that needs tweaking. Also every faction has sanitation buildings, such as canals and the like, now you'd think that an irrigated region would be more fertile right, nope. Unless you are I think it's Slavic, you have no way to increase the fertility of your regions, without mods that is. Also there is massive public order and squalor penalties for some things I can't quite understand, meaning you wont get the most out of your regions as you will probably build most regions the same way to keep everything running smoothly.

   So now lets talk about the stuff that makes this game actually worth playing for over 300+ hours, mods (you could say you are going for all badges and such, but that's game completion, doesn't mean you enjoy it). There is amazing mods for this game, you can find mods to overhaul most everything about this game. I play with mods that make the games more dynamic and diverse, also to make some things sensible. Like a mod that disables the loss of legacy tech as you progress the tech tree for romans, and making sanitation buildings provide fertility (sure the whole they lose sight of older tech as they change their ways is a nice thought, but don't take away the sanitation buildings, I prefer my aqueducts to having a bigger church, in fact I burned down all the churches in my playthroughs because the bonuses for Christianity suck compared to paganism, base game). 

   So long and short of it, if you get this game, playing it a few times without mods wont be too boring, until you get to mid game. Playing it with mods may make it more enjoyable for you, however if you are deciding between this and Shogun 2, go with Shogun 2, it's much better in my opinion (the happiness system for shogun 2 is a bit too easy but the rest of the game is good). So I hope you find this somewhat enlightening, maybe I helped you decide on buying this or not, or at least prepared you for it. Also just so you know, I only have one of the culture packs (that being vikings), and no other dlc, cause I didn't want to spend anymore money on this.",1491052154,1491052154,False,1,4294967295,0.476190477609634399,1,True,False,False,76561198257795109,39,4,57752,0,24976,1595957413,,

""Stumbling-block"" is turn based part, too much annoying micromanagement, building system is the worst from all total war games (Rome 2 has similar, but works good); in this kind of strategy games you should make wise decision when you put your money - Do I need to build new barracks for better soldiers or market to improve economy and income in my situation? or temple or some cultural building for stability or special bonuses? which town should I develop? In Attila you should fix puzzle, you have limited building spots , usefull buildings have penalties (food, squalor, public order) and must extremly carefull to combinate them in right way, Both Shogun 2 and even Rome 2 have similar system with limited building spots but simpler to use and works great, youn can't build everything everywhere, you must choose which cities/provincies will by economic/military/cultural.

12,30699659,english,"Overpriced trash that lacks logic at every single step and focuses on useless mechanics while flat out ignoring the issues that have been ongoing in every single Total War game since Medieval 2 and has yet to be fixed.

To start out, diplomacy, remember that? Might as well call it fuckyoumacy because the AI will flat out refuse every single offer you make, no matter how reasonable. Got 100+ relations with Eastern Roman Empire who broke their alliance by refusing to join you in a war and want a non-aggression pact? Not happening. 

Have 3 full armies advancing an a secluded barbarian capital and want peace? Not a chance in hell son. It would be better if they just removed the diplomacy mechanic from the game all together so at least they won't be deceiving you into thinking such a thing actually exists.

Next up is siege AI. You have a low 15% chance that the AI won't attack a walled city at all and prefer to sit outside the gates until the timer has run out, this happened on my very first siege battle. 

Then you have a low 50% chance that they'll completely ignore your soldiers and advance to the town square with the same generic Roman colosseum placed in nearly every Roman city. If you are lucky enough to have neither of these happen, they'll willingly throw their cavalry away charging into a deadly wall of spears, again, and again, and again.

Deploying soldiers is a nightmare and you'll constantly have to babysit your soldiers if you attempt any manuevers because pathfinding is laughably bad, nearly Empire-tier. When I order my archers to fire at the enemy within my town square they naturally form a 2 man wide 80 man deep line, then the front will be so stretched that they actually engage the enemy and then the whole unit will follow them into melee combat.

Civilians can be seen during siege battles which is really nice for immersion, but one has to wonder why they spent resources on this instead of actually fixing and testing the fucking game.

If their siege equipment is destroyed they will sit outside the city doing nothing until the timer runs out or you sally forth.

In most cities you can place 1-2 barricades in only the most redundant spots that provide no tactical advantage, but surely after months of siege they could build more than two laughable barricades? Might as well have not included this feature at all.

What's hilarious is the fact that if they bring siege weapons they can set your city ablaze and burn down virtually every building, but CA can't program a functioning AI in a single one of their games.


Onto battles. In real battles the engagements last for hours between days, not in Attila. Naturally the battles shouldn't play out that long in a videogame but here the battles are incredibly short, the average engagement with actual fighting is around 5-9 minutes long, with engagements only reaching 15 due to preparing and marching. 

I can hardly send my cavalry to flank the enemy because within a minute one of the units has already retreated with broken morale, but they'll return to battle 10 seconds later, and repeat this process until they are shattered.

Another particularly, yet minor and tiring annoyance is after winning or losing a battle you have to sit through an animation between 1v1 soldiers fighting to simulate your type of victory or defeat. While interesting at first when playing as the Roman Empires you have to sit through at least 4 of these a turn seeing your pathetic garrisons be defeated. 

And all the animations are meant for sword wielders, so you'll see stupid shit like a barbarian stabbing you in the throat with his axe/club then seeing your head pop off. While it can be funny it really goes to show the lack of effort and laziness of the Creative Assembly.

Everywhere throughout the game you'll see a great lack of effort in design and eventually come to wonder what chuckling idiot could fuck up so many clear concepts.

I could rant forever but I will end this here with a few pointers.

26,30380536,english,"Amazing game; strongly recommended.

Originally I wasn't interested in Rome 2 or this one at all. This one is so good, though, that I'll probably reconsider Rome 2 as well.

A brief summary on why I like it:

-it's a fresh take on a world somewhat similar to Medieval 2 - of course a few hundred years earlier
-diplomacy feels far more realistic than in any previous TW game I've played - or any other game for that matter. Except maybe Shogun 2 which I love.
-enemies don't give up a lost battle until they're really finished
-everything has a gritty feel to it. Instead of destroying city after city (as in many earlier games) and dealing with rebellions later if necessary, I now need to pay attention to what goes on in my fledgling empire. I have to fight many sordid and miserable battles against outnumbered enemies who just won't give up. Not as fun as winning easily... or is it? 
-I have played games like Empire and Medieval 2 where armies just fold but empires keep fighting back. In Attila, the armies seem to be the backbone of an empire, which is far more realistic in a military era.
-I cannot just expand like a maniac without consequences (well, I haven't played the Huns yet...) which makes for a satisfyingly realistic experience
-graphics are great
-everything seems to work

There were some complaints in the reviews I read like ""no new voice work"". Oh come on. The game will probably provide thousands of hours of fun. Compare that to almost anything else you can get for 40 bucks (sleazy things included) and complain then.

After playing a few more hours:

Exceptional game. I sacked Roma as Saxons, tried to find a smaller Western Roman settlement to capture and hold, and lost my army to a legion in North Africa. Meanwhile, back home up north, my alliances with the neighbours keep paying off: the Huns aren't yet close to my homestead. Planning a new expedition to Africa with plenty of resources at my disposal. Great fun!

After still more play:

I've only played Saxons (and Franks once) and managed to waste at least 3 days. Brilliant. I don't even care if I win or lose. This is an immersive game. Haven't tried Normal difficulty yet. Hard is pretty hard.

After one more day of play (lot of frustration too): I'm getting the hang of this. The more I play the more I like the game. I've played at least 4 crappy games as Saxons; now I finally seem to have a setup that works. I don't know if the game has been designed this way, but it seems as if it pushes me towards realistic goals by just not letting the AI players give up at all if they aren't completely lost. Agents are very important. 

After some more play:

The hard setting is too frustrating. I've played as Franks and Saxons, maybe 20 lost games or more. I wanted to keep playing but then I wanted to start winning, so I switched to normal difficulty. Still not boring, but the enemies do give up very easily. I'll get back to the hard setting after I win a campaign.

As expected, I quit playing all other games when I took this one up. Still strongly recommended. Can't wait to buy the Charlemagne campaign.",1488923714,1489613124,True,6,1,0.541272103786468506,0,True,False,False,76561198068851657,16,29,23393,0,5603,1557948809,,

81,30075982,english,"I've been playing the Total War series a lot. I used to be it's biggest fan and I spent several thousands of hours playing rome and medieval II. Many didn't like Empire, but I enjoyed it very much. I never played shogun 1or2 cause I have no interest in that setting and historic time period. But I heard many good things about it. Everything was great until Rome II came out. It was a complete disaster! And this game is basically an expansion of Rome 2. Same game but different cosmetics. Kind of like Barbarian Invasion was to Rome 1, or Kingdoms to Medieval 2. Some things are improved and many things are the same crap as before. Luckily I bought this at 75% off so no harm done.

Here are the game concepts I hate about this game:

The difficulty from this game comes from cheating AI, not good AI. Examples:
The AI can have 3-4 full armies supported by a single city while the player can barely afford a single full army with 2 complete regions.
The AI knows exactly where the player are on the battlefield even if you are hiding. I thought I could win a battle by hiding until the time went out but after standing still about 10 minutes like idiots they automatically discovered my hidden unit even though they were hiding deep in a forest behind a big hill.
Once my city was attacked from the sea by a small navy, but they were reinforced by 2 full armies. I was surprised cause I should have seen them coming. But after they won I saw that the armies was in fact far away out in the sea, way beyond the reinforcing range. This has happened several times.

The Diplomacy system is absolutely retarded. Nobody wants to accept any deal unless you pay huge sums of money. Why won't they accept trade agreements that are mutually beneficial even though the relations between you are neutral or good? Why the f*ck do you get a large diplomacy penalty with all factions just because you have a large empire? If you expand your empire (which is pretty much the goal of the game) you can forget having any kind of diplomatic relations to anyone. friends will turn on you and everyone will hate you for having a large empire -retarded! Should be the opposite, the more powerful you are the more influence over diplomacy you should have.

The political system is also kind of retarded. There is domination (influence) and control (political actions) which combines into your overall power over your faction, that's fine. You can spend influence points to perform actions like seek support or adopt someone. So far so good, it makes sense that if you perform an action you ""use up"" your favour and influence. But the system is broken cause every action you do has too small chance of succeding! I think it's 50-50 based on how many times it fails. So if you want to seek support and gain control there is a 50% chance you lose 20 influence (sometimes more if there are complications) and gain 6% control, and 50% chance you lose both 20 influence and 4% control. So you pretty much always lose. The best way to maintain power is to appoint your opponents to offices because they lose influence when they apply. Does that make any sense at all? But what's even more incredible is the effects of having power, some are good some bad. The more power you have the worse penalties your faction gets to a point where the negative effects outweighs the good effects. The opposite is also true if you lose power. So the player get punished for both succeding and failing in the political system. Why even care then??? Also expect half of your children, especially the bastards to die of unknown reasons before becoming adults.

The generals and governors and auto-replenish system. Don't you just love it when the army you just defeated automatically gets a new general with a new bodyguard unit and the rest of the army magically replenish in a few turns even though they are far from a city or out at sea. It's better not to kill their general so they have a weak unit for a turn or two. The same goes for your own of course, but it doesn't feel right. It feel like cheating or a game for children. If a unit is reduced it should have to get real trained reinforcements that move on the map. That was a great thing about previous games. A good player planned for reinforcements in advance and sent them behind the main army and refilled the ranks and the damaged units were extracted in cover of the main army, got onboard the ships and sent home for retraining. I miss that! It's impossible now since units can't move without a general and you can't recruit a bunch of generals since you lose power in the political system. The generals themselves has the most boring and generic trait and level system than ever before. I loved the system in previous games where the traits and retinues depended on the actual events and battles the guy experienced at the hands of the player. Now it's just level up after each battle, choose two magic skills in the skill tree and repeat for every general.

Here comes my favorite thing to complain about in this game, the worst of it's kind in any game, the least logical game mechanic of all time, the thing that destroyed rome 2 for me and made me stop playing, the most terrible concept imaginable, the biggest piece of shit ever: The building system. Where do I even begin? Let's compare to medieval 2 which had a great building system. In medieval 2 each city had a large number of possible buildings with different paths down the building tree. Upgrading the city to a larger one unlocked new levels to each building. Some cities had special buildings like mines based on the resources in the region.  Every city was independent and could be specalized when you didn't have time to build everything in every city. You could train cavalry in one city and archers in one and infantry in one, and then send them all to the big foundry to pick up the best armor and weapons before sending them to war. There was no limit to the number of buildings in a city. In this game however cities are not independent. Usually there are three cities per region. They all share the same terrible building system. There is a fixed number of slots in which to build things. 3-4 slots for minor cities and 5-6 slots for region capitals. One slot is always the city itself and if it's a coastal city one is always the docks. so that leaves you with the grand number of 2 slots for small cities and 4 slots for large cities to build on. So in total you can choose 8 buildings in a region the size of a country. That's just the beginning. The level of logic of the building effects are mindblowing. The builings belongs to different categories and have different levels and almost anything you upgrade will reduce public order or increase squalor or both. Buildings that increase public order often consumes large amounts of food. Only very few buildings have no negative effect, mainly buildings that gives sanitation to reduce squalor. So of these 8 slots you have to place at least two farms for food or your empire is gonna crash. Since farms produce squalor and decrease public order for some wierd far fetched reason, you also need at least one building for sanitation probably two. You also need one that provides public order. I think all regions have a resource so that's one slot. now you have only one or two slots left to choose what kind of region you want this to be, a booming industrial area with a basket weaver or a religous center with a shrine or perhaps a commercial hub with a market. If you don't use the slots exactly the way it has to be you are gonna end up in a situation where you don't have enough food cause you can't upgrade your farms cause they reduce public order and give squalor and you can't upgrade the tavern or whatever cause it requires food and you can't build sanitation cause there is no room. Who the fuck came up with this system?

Seriosly if you are new to the franchise, get medieval 2 or rome 1 instead. You are gonna enjoy it more",1487672376,1487691869,False,21,1,0.493561059236526489,9,True,False,False,76561197984748731,37,8,7463,0,5724,1488300266,,

84,30062184,english,"I really enjoy Total War games.  Did not get a start until Medieval 2, but I have played all since then.  Aside from Rome 2 which I preordered and then only played for about 10 hours because it was simply not fun, I've enjoyed every version of the game (admittedly I barely played Napolean but I enjoyed it).  Because Rome 2 was so bad to me, Attila had a bit of a negative image to overcome.  I waited until Attila was on sale, but I had every intention of buying it because Attila himself is interesting to me, they had 3 viking factions, and the fall of the Western Roman Empire also had some appeal.  

I have to say, I really liked Attila.  It has some negatives, but overall it redeemed the failures of Rome 2 for me.  Horde mode is an awesome addition!  Makes things interesting throughout.  Attila gives a tough ""enemy"" for everyone, but never seemed OP (except in a co-op campaign one time).

Pros:
+ Horde mode.  Really keeps things interesting.  I liked playing a few hordes but also having the opportunity to go horde mode with anyone if things got messy in my area.
+ Family tree!  I find this really fun.  Assassinating, marrying family members for alliances, appointing a different heir, or various bonus positions available.  Co-op game we traded daughters consantly.  
+ Viking Clans (Jutes, Danes, Geats).  Even though they are all similar, I love anything Viking and these all had that feel.  Really enjoyable campaigns to play.
+ Agents seemed less OP in this and actually useful at times (this is a touchy subject, but in the past they've seem utterly useless in practice or OP when the AI uses them).
+ Campaign map is pretty good looking. 

Cons:
- In game battles aren't as good to me.  My troops often just seemed to route for no reason.  Admittedly I stopped playing MOST battles only a few hours into my first campaign because of this.  One problem with all Total War games is that the AI just avoids fighting me if it can't win easily 9/10 times.  This gets a bid old, but what it does is makes it so I have no reason to fight most battles because it's a landslide either way.  This actually stopped being the case late in the game vs. Attila himself.  He would roll up to my cities with 3 full stacks and actually fight vs my city garrison + full stack or two and we had epic battles, but then my PC didn't like those fights if I played them (would get pretty laggy).

- Campaign map movement.  There are spots I couldn't tell what would happen or how far something actually was in terms of engagements (rule of thumb, the AI, on every level, will ALWAYS stay just out of your range lol).  The map looks nice but sometimes is hard to tell where a river actually is or is not.  Even with the movement ranges on the map it sometimes did not seem to match up.

- Way too often my generals get horrible traits, or the kids when they come of age, for no apparent reason.  I know there are statistical odds for most traits, but I killed off a LOT of my offspring in pointless battles on purpose because they had so many bad traits.  That gets annoying.  I'd love to see a system for encouraging better traits.  Something like education for youth or a randomly generated list of available generals that you could assign traits based on points or something.  

Overall, I enjoyed Attila and would recommend.  Best way to buy would be a GOTY type edition with all DLC.  $45 is not bad for this game, but the DLC will make it pricier.  It is a step up from ROME 2 imho and therefore back on track for CA.

Rather than the simple fluidity of a previous title like Medieval II's campaign, Atilla feels like an highly overcomplicated, clusterfuck of poorly designed interfaces and plain old horse shit. 

The combat feels sluggish and tricky with the frustration of managing the piss poor interface immensly overpowering the sense of enjoyment and accomplishment after a victory on the battlefield. Im not sure who told CA that we wanted Total War to have a crippled, deformed child with the Civilization franchise but the dreadful and pointless tech research element of the game feels as though it was designed by a spastic goldfish. It ads nothing but an irritating inconvenience that hinders your ability to get to the parts of the game which you actually might enjoy.

94,29949634,english,"OK game but the White-Huns were probably Iranic, not Mongolic or Turkic. Also there is no reference to the Eddic tradition of the Burgundians and their origins in Scandinavia. Age of Charlemagne campaign negates the amount of Slavs that actually would have populated the realm of the Pannonian Avars while also inflating the number of Berbers and Arabs that would have moved to Iberia during the Umayyad period. Also optimized terribly and DLC :( And Uralics like the Magyars are portrayed exactly like the Huns.

Otherwise, the best depiction of the Great-Migration Period outside the realm of books. First time a Total War campaign was sprinkled with a little bit of non-martial complexity in the way of climate, fertility, disease, sanitation, population and settlement-development mechanics.  Not to mention the blend of Medieval 2's family trees with Rome 2's political offices and intrigue system. This is obviously not a Paradox game, but the inclusion of skill-based characters who also have relationships with eachother makes for a more immersive single-player experience. The historical events and nomadic/migratory hordes add a level of dynamism in the campaign. Unlike of previous Total War games, where factions in different corners of the map simply annex surrounding provinces and create stagnant super-states until ecountered by the player, an emergent empire including that of the player could see quite a bit of trouble stemming from Nomadic and Horde agitation near their borders. Unlike Attila's spiritual predecessor, Rome Total War's Barbarian Invasion expansion pack, hordes have their own mobile buildings and economies. Settlements are now impermanent, considering they can be completely destroyed upon conquest and some factions are entirely disposed to doing so. Unfortunately, CA takes this a bit too far because (minor spoiler):

[spoiler]The Huns and White-Huns live up to their Apocalyptic expectations and may end up torching the entire map, depending on your difficulty setting[/spoiler]

All-in-all Total War Attila creates a more-or-less successful attempt at a Total War game that mixes the series' classic build-expand-conquer formula with a survival experience where a player may actually feel a sense of existential terror in the mid or even late game.

10,29766353,english,"Salutations gamers; renowned reviewer T Swag here coming at ya with a brand new review for my new favorite game, Overwatch, So without further ado lets jump right into it. Let it be known I have been a long time loyal fan of the previous Elder Scrolls games so needless to say I was very excited to play the latest installment. I began by starting up a grand campaign eager to jump right into the action and cycled through the fourteen base factions in the game. After thorough review the Saxons were the disgusting Germanic tribe of choice for me. Once ingame I realized immediately that the game had improved its map design and I was impressed with the family features having been overhauled to have more meaning. I immediately went and attacked the Franks and much to my chagrin I was paddled by them due to a poor military decision. Combat is good, even better with mods. Units are more responsive to your commands and the AI seems to actually have a will to win rather then unfasten their tunics and bend over like previous Battlefield installments. After my great defeat I began to notice the vast amount of factions on the map and most of which were unavailable to me in the faction selection, my serotonin began to dip.  I once again navigated to the store page to feast my eyes not on the one, two, but EIGHT DLCs available for purchase which all add up to a whopping $81.22(CAD)! More than the base game! The Blood and Burning DLC especially caught my eye, pay for blood and gore effects?! I began falling ill and felt pains in various areas of my body. I decided to head to my local hospital for evaluation and I was greeted with some devastating news... I now have cancer. My doctor asked me about my lifestyle choices. ""Have you ever smoked?"" ""No never"" ""How has your diet been"" ""I always eat my raw venison and take my 42 suppliments!"" ""Have you ever been witness to abhorrent marketing practices?"" I then realized it was in fact, the developer/publishers DLC structure that gave me cancer.   In conclusion, Watch Dogs 2 improves upon its strengths, and corrects quite a few weaknesses, however it seems there is a breach in the hull, that breach being the deplorable DLC structure. Whether it was Creative Assembly's idea or SEGA's who knows but it ain't right my friends.

But Attila's easy mode was much better for me, and little by little I got much better at total war games. I have noticed a few flaws in the game and I'm not very picky. It does get repetitive after a few singleplayer campaigns and it has day one dlc and I think that's awful.

Good game and well worth the buy for anyone with experince of strategy games or just interested in strategy games. Although I haven't played to much of Atilla as of right now this is not my first in the series. It is however my favourite. No game is ever going to be perfectly balanced. However, I can say when playing this game at a hard difficulty. It feels fair, you are not massively overpowered and can wipe out any force that heads your way. At least it feels like usually the army better suited for the encounter wins. For example if it is a feild battle and you have the Cavalery and Archer superiority you will win, if it is a seige or a narrow pass and you have more Sword/Spearmen and can wipe out their calvary, hold their men in the choke point and pick off their archers with your own; again you will win. Forces you to plan ahead and plan your engagement with the enemy.

But the game is pretty. But most of the units are clones of each other. Having come from Medieval 2, this wouldn't be a surprise. Except Atilla came out almost a decade AFTER MEDIVAL 2. I was thinking of keeping it around in waiting for the medieval mod for it to be released. But no. Not worth the wait, time, or money.


EDIT:

Well, I caved and rebought the game and played some more. Playing as the Saxons and conquering sacking the Romans as they withdraw from France and Germania is fun. Though the battles still feel to quick and arcadey, for a Total War game with such pretty graphics, I'd have hoped this wouldn't be so.

But where it's really at is the Medieval Kingdoms 1212 AD mod.

Even though you can't play campaign (yet), this mod is where I spent most of my time. I know I said before that I wouldn't bother waiting, but seriously, it's great fun. If you are looking for a reason to get this game, get it for the Medieval mod.

Now onto the rest. Besides the shitty battles, awkward engine and obnoxious DLC whoring, this game is great fun when it shines. It's a decent game, the fact that it's only really a GREAT game with mods isn't nice, but I'm sure others would enjoy it, hence why I will recommened it.",1456273816,1485750928,True,0,0,0.502439022064208984,0,True,False,False,76561198162143939,55,10,12639,0,4621,1527881040,,
25,29577339,english,"I'm going to choose to write this review based on the actual game, instead of the developer. Seeing how this review is suppose to be about the game, not the developer.

This is a really great game. It is based in a time of mystery, where there isn't a lot of recorded history. The campaign and battle mechanics are a lot alike what we have come to expect from Total War games. A beautiful transition between turn based empire building strategy, and real time combat strategy. There are a wide array of available units that can be utilized in different ways to create an effective strategy that can turn back any enemy. Even the f*cking huns who are absolutely terrifying when you actually meet them, especially when you are the mostly foot infantry based Vikings, and they have horse archers.

All of the different available factions have different units and ways of playing that allow for multiple play throughs with a different feel for the game. Even though many of the Germanic and Barbarian tribes feel a little copy paste, their different locations and specialized late game units make each play through unique.

The empire building is a bit tedious and frustrating at times, because you have to delicately balance your provinces' sanitation, public order, and food, all while trying to make enough money to support the upkeep of your armies. But I love micromanaging and after I came up with a simplified system for each faction, it became easy.

In the end, it has the same great empire building and real time battles I have come to enjoy from the Total War franchise. It is also set in a very interesting time period that I don't know a lot about.

On to the critiques on the developers though. It sucks that they released several factions as DLC when they should have been part of the base game. It's a greedy cash grab and a bad example of what a developer should do. That being said, I got the game and all of the factions for $20 when they were on sale. I wouldn't recommend paying full price, just to show them that this business practice is not acceptable.",1485741965,1485741965,True,1,0,0.50205761194229126,0,True,False,False,76561198038679968,117,6,35230,0,14356,1572543216,,

27,29552959,english,"With strategy defined as the link between political objectives and military means, Total War: Attila fails as a strategy title by being fundamentally flawed in both areas.

On the side of political objectives, the greatest problem is that it is simply impossible to achieve the game’s greatest victory type with any faction that begins with their capital in a smaller settlement rather than a larger city. In order to achieve the greatest victory, the player is required to construct a specific end-game building in their capital, yet this building can only be built within a city. With the player left without a method of relocating their capital from a settlement to a city, the player is left permanently unable to fulfil that victory condition.

Concerning military means, and taking the usual Total War brand quirks as given, expect your experience to be frustrated by the following issues, to name but a few. On the campaign map, clearly encircled enemy armies retreat directly through those of the attacker, rendering grand manoeuvre worthless. Additionally, certain unit battlefield special abilities are governed by senseless game mechanics. For example, it is possible for an individual archer (individual meaning single person armed with a bow in this case) to fire a single poison arrow which, should it strike an individual in a target unit comprising of 120 men, will result in 40% of them dying due to the application of a poison debuff. This will occur irrespective of the target unit’s armour value, missile block chance, shield strength etc. Finally, ranged units capable of firing over friendly units standing 20 ranks in front of them choose instead to unleash volley after volley of assorted projectiles directly into the backs of their comrades. This happens even more frequently with melee units armed with secondary projectile weapons.

In summary, this game is a wasted opportunity to cover an interesting and incredibly violent period in history.

Cities and settlements are limited to very small amounts of buildings, most of which are taken up with the necessary food, sanitation, and public order buildings. 
Generals have armies, not the other way around. The number of Generals and Admirals are severly limited making it impossible to defend provinces and launch large scale invasions. (The more powerfull you are the more Generals/Admirals you are allowed to have, making it really hard to fight people much more powerfull than you)
To change a general, the whole army has to be disbanded.
Skills trees have no logical flow whatsoever, forcing every character to be a well rounded good at nothing waste.
Missing/not avalible diplomacy options at random.
Multiplayer campaign map rotation gliches
Inability to make/break certain alliances in multiplayer campaigns. 
To many unecessary clicks for the player not in action during multiplayer campaigns

40,29477210,english,"This is both a great Total War game and by far one of the most frustrating to play late game.  

Because surviving is the goal, empire-building comes with some severe barriers to entry, most notably the gigantic cost to convert city centers or colonize ruined settlements.  Late game, assuming you're like me and build an empire anyway, you have a ton of territory to defend from the Huns and you'll likely be at war with enough or powerful enough factions to limit how many forces you can bring to bear on the Huns.  This works out ok for Germans and Vikings, it makes the game challenging but not punishingly so.  If you settle or start further northeast though you are ****ed.  

This is immensely frustrating because the Slavs are among the most interesting factions to play, their units are unique, they are immune to winter attrition (a helpful boon), their minor temples can add fertility to a region (a godsend as each ""chapter"" opens with a global cooling effect that drops the fertility of a ton of regions by 1 each ""chapter""), and they can colonize ruined settlements without cost.  The problem is that Huns not only spawn with most if not all armies stacked full of top tier units by the time Attila emerges, they ****ing respawn the turn after you kill them.  This is fine for Germans, Vikings, Celts and literally anyone who doesn't have a steppe empire, but it ****s you so hard if you play Slavs or make a steppe empire as fresh hordes instantly spawn on your ****ing doorstep repeatedly until you kill Attila, which you have to do three or four times before Huns can no longer spawn new hordes.  

Even assuming you don't have wars with anyone else, and you will, fighting the Huns can overwhelm you easily as you can't afford to keep too many troops sitting around defending territory and if a Hun horde is present, they rarely come in less than two, then none of your units in the region can regenerate. Because the Huns aren't really paying for their unlimited hordes you can spend tens of thousands of gold desperately fighting them off and still end up in dire straits.  None of this is helped by the fact that Huns have inexplicably fantastic infantry and artillery on top of their monster cavalry, this is a major problem for me because I could probably hold the Huns at bay if not for the fact their armies are so well rounded that they excel in pitched and siege battles even when they're outnumbered by a sizable margin. Not to mention the Huns will burn any city they encounter to the ground, which weakens your already strained economy and undoes potentially hundreds of turns of progress.  I like that this game is challenging and has a bunch of mechanics to make late game difficult but it's frustrating as **** to watch the empire you spent over 100 turns building burn down around you as you desperately try to kill Attila and stop the respawning hordes.

In conclusion, this game is a ton of fun to play for 100 turns.  I love razing settlements and watching fire engulf the map, the buildings are much improved from Rome Total War 2, the graphics are better, and you can make early game easy on yourself by playing as various barbarians or you can make the game a frantic struggle from the get go if you like a challenge by playing as Rome. Plagues no longer totally wreck armies or towns, although they now last for varying periods of time and can easily spread from one settlement to another even if you have good sanitation.  It has the best of what Rome Total War 2 had to offer and so much more.  But the **** the Huns.  They need severe rebalancing, don't give them great infantry and artillery (which they really shouldn't have), and when a new horde spawns it should take four or five turns just like it would to recruit a normal army so that you have a little breathing room.  I don't mind having three of the eight (there's always eight hordes at a time by late game) hordes rampaging through my territory at a time, but if they keep respwaning endlessly near or in my territory a turn after I beat them I will get zerg-rushed to death regardless of how good I play and how many armies I set aside just to fight the Huns.  Or better yet just give the Huns eight awesome hordes by late game and do away with the respwaning entirely, save for maybe Attila's horde.  I know the obvious answer is don't colonize the steppe, but it's so much more limiting if I can't, it basically forces me to fight just Germans and West Empire or just Eastern factions and East Empire with a dash of Huns on the side for each scenario.  There's no other spot in the game where you're stuck between the Sassanids' allies, the East Empire, eastern Germans and incoming Hun hordes and the idea of forging a kindgom in such a tough spot is immensely appealing.  The Huns would still be hard to beat even if you rebalanced them as I outlined and it would still make for a fun challenge.  But as it is now it's impossible, for me anyway, and worse its really ****ing frustrating, enough so to make me outright quit campaigns I was otherwise very much into.",1485326002,1485366829,True,32,2,0.782708227634429932,1,True,False,False,76561198120877834,41,1,59250,0,8848,1593398824,,

Following the (very arguable) failure of Total War: Rome II, CA (creative assembly) released Total War: ATILLA. 
They set forth looking to fix the failure of Rome II, but what they did was instead so much better than a mere fix. What I found instead was something astounding, I never thought to see ALL of these features jam packed into the VANILLA game. You can migrate to a new territory when you lose everything or even start out as an actual rebellion via one of the tribes, or fight as the great huns or even the roman empire(s, west and east) themselves, all via vanilla standard purchase.  All of the graphical bugs as far as I have seen from Rome II are fixed, and even vastly improved. Throws my GPU out of the water after taking a sledgehammer to it. And my generation is only a few years old- as in, it's the 4th or mabye 5th best on the market as of writing this. This isn't because the game is not optimized, but because the graphics are that good. 
Music is vastly imrpoved in my opinion too, unlike the second rome game where I had to use the first romes music to feel truly immersed, this has its own music set that does it just fine. The attention to detail is amazing, you can actually see the townspeople flee in terror when you are sieging, and they made it so towers and gates are not borderline invincable (Rome 2 >.>)

There will always be bias towards or against a game based on previous editions of the series. For those of you coming into this without playing the rest of TOTAL WAR you will be pleasantly surprised with a decent, challenging game. There is a lot to focus on all at once and you will stay busy on the battlefield or with politcal events.

For those of you who have been playing the rest of the series, I recommend this game with a bit of caution. The political system is revamped and makes it seem like more of an empire building game than a war game. If your preference is more war oriented, it will be hard to focus on just that. Faction politics does require attention. The game does have nifty new details to keep track of a legions health, integrity, etc. Also, the skill tree for characters and legions is much better designed. Instead of seeing options a few at a time when leveling up, you can see the whole skill tree so you can plan ahead of time.

Not only is it extremely hard, almost impossible to win (because everyone is trying to kill you, pretty much), but it gets buggy (probably for all factions), so it is not as smooth as Rome 2, for me. Sometimes I have seige artillery that is defending a city or on a fleet and it will not obey orders. It either does not fire or fires at the wrong target.... They took out a lot of the things that I loved about Rome 2. Garrisoning cities is harder to do and manage. Most ships cannot ram, only board and light on fire, certain ones can, but that often turns into a melee fight anyway. Garrisoning cities is hard to do in this game. It's harder than ever to maintain public order and now you have to worry about sanitation or your cities become sick and your armies die. Regiments are small, only groups of 56 men. Then you have hordes of tribes running through your lands and declaring war. These tribes steal your food when they are in your lands, so you have to kill them or you starve. The hordes don't take your cities, they burn them to the ground or damage them to the point where you have to abandon it because you cannot afford repairs... Everytime an army, no matter how small, seiges your city, it costs about $1000 gold in repairs.
If you're a hardcore total war fan that loves challenges, this is it. Prepare to spend days and days just trying to maintain public order and an income while defending your cities with small garrisons vs huge armies (so you cannot afford to ever auto-resolve)... Prepare for your allies to randomly attack you. Prepare for the Picts and other factions from the other side of the map to land on your shores and raid your cities. Prepare to not really play the game, but witness the fall of Rome as despite your best efforts your death will be:
1. Be conquered by the shear amount of units
2. Rebels take over, because public order is hard to manage
3. Run out of money, cannot replinish units, get conquered
4. Run out of food, starve to death
5. Abandon all of your settlements to only the ones you can defend, run out of money or food, die. 
6. A combination of all of these.

If you love killing Romans and taking their lands this game is good other than the buggyness. I don't see a lot of differences between each army, just lots of levy spearmen... 
I really like how they make fire a formidable weapon. Fire can burn and spread and kill in battles. I like the greater deversity in cities and how you can upgrade their defenses by building better walls.
I'd likely not mind the challenge if I did not have irritating bugs happen now and then.... I mean, the real Eastern Roman Empire survived, so can we.

Love the period, like everything about it, but it is unplayably hard to win.  32 hours in, I have yet to make it past about 10 turns.  Set to easy, playing an easy faction that is.

You can edge your way forward saving and reloading and trying to find the right path forwrd, but that isn't any fun.

If you try and do anything you will face:
1: an overwhelming enemy alliance with military units upgraded to a level you will not get to for 30 turns.
2: no money to do anything.
3. Your cities, paticularly any you capture revolting and spawning a larger force than defended it in the first place.

The tutorial is useless, the manual worse.

I just think the developers cashed in on the Total war name, recycled 90% of the Rome II Code, and didn't even try to make the game playable.  I haven't bought the warhammer game because Iam done with this franchise and I will never ever buy anything from this company again.

I'll start with the pro's against arguably the best of the total war series which was rome. The rts battles are an improovement and the graphics are far superior and now for the negatives, the AI seems even more stupid than it did 10 years ago, lots of new units all of which are pointless as an army of spears, few archers and horses still the best and cheapest set up. The game seems to be easy on every setting and getting an offspring to adulthood without cheating is ridiculously random but then the civil war aspect seems relatively pointless as soon as one starts it seems to half one of your armies and makes another rebel one or sometimes if it's just a general creates units that are damaged on both sides but your side always seems to be dominent so very next turn you crush them. If you're thinking of buying the download content DO NOT buy the last roman, while it has appeal of playing as walking city armies it's short lived and so easy it actualy feels like a job than a game, you will conquer everything you face and the only time it's tricky is if you declare independance, this is also simple if you wait until you have max armies in game think it's 14 and place an army next to 14 cities  so when you delcare independance you will instantly have 14 cities, I chose spain as an obvious home and with a couple of turns nearly all of spain and north africa was mine and east rome wants peace which I accept. Because the ai is a simpleton east rome has built royal barrocks armouries guard stations everywhere which while demolishing pays for your army upkeep untill provinces settle, couple more turns later you should be raking in over 30-50k a turn, 6 turns later i buy ostrigoths loyalty for 200k who own all of italy the franks join for peanuts along with sardinians, this leaves just east rome who now mainly live in france, you cant buy these off so you have to kill them which takes a maximum of 10 turns but probably less. Even though I now own every single piece of land i still haven't met either of the winning conditions for the separtists, apparently to win i have to build an enamaler ( hardest part was finding what building tree it was in ) and royal barrocks which considering I'm the only faction left seems a pointless building to build but I build one and 4 turns later I win.

Pros:
-Great graphics
-Smart AI
-Fun campaign
-Challenging even on ""Normal"" difficulty
-Unique and immersive factions
-New mechanics
-Fixed many old Total War problems
-Truly apocalyptic

Cons:
-Lacking history
-Lacking major factions
-Battles are still too quick
-The developers of the game added many DLC's which feel a like ""pay to play"" (so buy this game and some of its DLC's on sale )

Final Thoughts:
I've been a veteran Total War player for more than a decade and have played every total war out there. This game is definetly good. The campaign map is beautiful and the raze mechanic is truly a good addition to the Total War series. It's hard even on normal difficulty, and the AI is much smarter than in all other Total War games. Each faction has immersive traits and special missions that make them unique. There are some negative aspects that make the game less enjoyable and if they were improved on, it would make this game perfect. I recommend buying the game on sale and also buying the Empires of Sand and Age of Charlemagne DLC's. Age of Charlemagne DLC feels like a seperate game itself and is like Medieval 3 Total War in some ways. Finally, to make the game truly enjoyable and get rid of some negative aspects, add many mods to it. There's a ton of them on the Steam Workshop and the community has made great mods which I thank them for doing.",1480806044,1483326491,True,22,20,0.62806326150894165,0,True,False,False,76561198156805456,28,5,32510,0,15675,1584814740,,

Honestly it's alright. Now, that might be anticlimactic but on the whole The strategic layer is kinda fun - I actually enjoy the need to pick and choose what gets built where and I'm ok with making sacrifices in some regions to allow others to develop, to me it adds some weight to the decision making and kinda feels more realistic. The family tree and the balance between dominion and control is pretty interesting too if somewhat frustrating as the game goes on. The two major things the game does well are the tactical battles and the graphics.

The tactical battles are actually really good this time around, Cavalry is brutal in a charge and ranged units are pretty well balanced. The siege maps are cool if a bit same-y and the amphibious landings are actually pretty awesome. The game looks damn good as well, with the detail in the strategic map something I really enjoy. The procedural damage effects are good too and add something to the city battles. Agents aren't so OP this time around as well, they're useful but not game-endingly powerful despite the AI still using them more than is resonable (if I do say so myself) This game, much like it's predecessors has playable naval battles somewhat akin to those in Shogun 2 and are on the whole not bad, despite the somewhat cheesy tendency for naval troops to be defeated by embarked land forces, although this can be countered by staying at range or using the satisfyingly destructive artillery ships.

The main reason for this negative review is by now a dead horse so furiously beaten that it's probably just mush by now - the pretty awful DLC policy that's also made a rather galling appearance in warhammer - which i've for some reason brought on sale but not really played yet. As someone who's paid up for pretty much all the DLC i'd say that all of it with the possible exception of age of charlemagne  and the empires of the sands all the ""culture packs"" are just damn reskins with too few unique units and maybe some story content - which is in itself kinda interesting but not worth the price in any real way. This really does feel like half of a game which was then filled in with DLC.

The second issue I have with attilla is the AWFUL optimization - my machine is admittedly not at all impressive but I far surpass the minimum system requirements. Thankfully this issue has been mostly fixed with patches and now the game runs pretty well on the whole - Although I do still get the odd slowdown when things get hectic.

As someone who's never played ROME 1 or 2 I can't say how this Attila stands up next to it's closest bretheren but in my mind it's a decisive step backwards from Shogun II, Medieval II or even Empire. The rumored Total war: Victoria may yet reverse the worrying trend of DLC-centric game presentation but until then i'd recommend The fall of the samurai over the fall of Rome any day. Attila is certainly alright, but you've got any doubts wait until it's on sale and be picky with DLC. The last Roman is just stupid and the blood and burning pack is blatant money grabbing and is simply bloody awful.

16,28769406,english,"This is, in my opinion, one of the best Total War games.

Rome 2 was an utter disappointment. It was perhaps the most expected, most hyped game in the series, yet failed to deliver. It was riddled with bugs, major features were removed or streamlined, and while it had its strengths, the weaknesses far outnumbered them. Attila then essentially took the formula of Rome 2 and hugely improved it. The result is, to me, one of the most well balanced, most entertaining games they have made so far. The graphics are amazing, the ambience, well, they really managed to represent the chaotic, semi-apocalyptic feel that, to the population at the time, is what they must have felt like seeing an empire such as Rome fall, and all the changes that came with it.

The gameplay is really good as well. As mentioned, everything is well balanced, the campaign map, the empire building and its management, the battles and recruiting systems, it all falls into place and is really intuitive once you understand the basics. It's in essence Rome 2's simplified, streamlined gameplay, but with some actual depth and immersion to it, which actually makes it entertaining.

My only real complains about Attila are the number of DLC's which can be quite costly if you intend to buy them all in order to fully experience the game, and the ""fake"" difficulty that is seen on their most recent products. For instance, the fact that the roman roster is too weak when compared to their adversaries. How come a legionnaire with full body chainmail, helmet, big sword and shield + all the training and discipline they are known for, can barely hold against a bunch of famished barbarian tribesmen with nothing but regular old clothes and a simple spear and shield? I get that it's to make the ""last stand"" feel even more intense but... oh well, fortunately, these and many other similar complaints can be easily solved with a visit to the workshop and a couple clicks.

Speaking of which, another great thing about this game is how moddeable it is. Still no campaign map modding though, which absolutely sucks.

All in all, this is a very good game. Few other games have been so rewarding as how you feel after facing dozens of enemy factions, famine, disorder, disease, civil war, invasions and skirmishes against a dozen more enemies... and surviving the Hunnic doom stacks.. and then you not only save the Western Roman Empire from total collapse, but actually lead it to greater prosperity and power. Or taking one of the barbarian factions that start with just one region and a ragtag bunch of misfits as an army, and lead them to actually dismantling the Roman Empire and estabilishing your own semi-medieval kingdom.

The replayability is immense, even when playing the same factions.

Well it's hard on new comers that's for sure, think of it as a civ game but with a whole lot more depth,  and a fantastic battle system where every unit you have on the battlefield has a role and use,  tactics are key but if like me your terrible when it comes to strategic management and thinking you can beat your enemies with POWER!! AKA numbers. 

There are a few problems with Attila though 
- The prologue which serves as a tutorial only teaches you the bare minimum needed also it has a tendency to not work as intended towards the end. 
- The turn clock is soooo slow!  You can make a brew in the time it takes to get to your next turn. Do far I've found no fix
-not enough is explained to you,  I have had to research for myself how to play and fix issues within settlements. 
-For newcomers there's a lot to chew on which can be rather overwhelming,  it took me a months break to get into it,  first time I booted it up I was bewildered to say the least. 

With these negatives in mind though there is a silver lining...  The community for the Total War games is fantastic and there's always the help you need if you give the energy to search for what you're stuck with. 
That being said I still don't understand certain things and find myself in the rough after taking over more than one settlement. 

This really is a fantastic game that just needs a bit of your time. And right now it's on sale..  For 8 bloody quid!! If you like civilization style games at all,  or the idea of building an empire this game will see you right.  If you want to destroy the world..  Same applies.

AI and diplomacy got waaaaay better, and the victory conditions weren't such a massive undertakings either. True to the time period, the campaign is pretty chaotic in a good way. With the Huns destroying everything, you never know what's going to happen and factions get up and migrate all over the map. 
What pleases me the most is how fair it is. The original Barbarian Invasion expansion for Rome was pretty bad about the other factions being overpowered with huge armies poping out of thin air when they turn into a horde. In Atilla, if you kill them all in their last city, they're dead. If they had an amry roaming around, that army stays that way and doesn't inflate for no reason. If the AI builds an army too big to support, it shows and they suffer from having no money. The cheating AI and gang up the winner stuff is all gone. I think it's the most fair Total War game I've played so far. 
My only complaint is that a lot of the units are the same between factions. Not that big of a deal, but some more cultural diversity would be nice.

You can play as one of the smaller, emerging nations, nipping at the heels of the larger empires to claim what you can, or play as one of the Roman Empires and try to stave off the encroachments of your rivals. The worsening weather will tighten your food supply, and entire cities can be wiped off the map. And then there are the Huns, threatening everyone with their scorched-earth policies.

The whole game feels like a long struggle against the darkness. That makes it difficult, but also more rewarding if you can bring order to the chaos. Or, just sit back and watch the chaos engulf the Western Roman Empire. That's fun, too. (If you play, do take at least one turn as the WRE, just to see how crazy it gets.) The politics system takes a little getting used to, but it's easier to figure out than in other games. Plus, arranging marriages and assassinating people is cool!

On release, i gave this game a Negative rating, due to a million bugs on release.

it runs smooth, not a single crash since i started palying it this month. and i went through several compaigns on Very hard.
although, i find that the game has gotten a bit too easy even on highest difficulty. half way through once you conquer an entire side of the map. you ll see little challenge in carrying onward. Atilla shouldhave come a bit sooner to be honest. 

the charlmagne DLC era is amazing. its pretty much beginning of medival times. and remind me of the time we had the viking DLC during the first total war medival. playing as the danes, i sent three armies to mercia. just to get coutnered by a masssive 10 army battles vs my 3. held the coastal town i took for one attack thanks to onagars and flaming arrows. but then had to abandon entire invasiona dn run back to mummy.

1) my units was losing alot of men.
2) one unit ended up running away cause of it.

Now in Rome 2 i could do the same but only need one or two units and still had the manpower and resove to finish off the rest of the enemies army.

Don't listen to most of the people who write these reviews because the don't know shit about Total War. I have been playing since I was about five or six years old and so I think I should be pretty damn capable at giving you the truth it a quick review of this game.

1. Need to improve AI because they are not cooperative unless they are your close allies which means you can't get many more close allies unless you found factions.

2. Need more STRATEGIC GAMEPLAY FFS CA. Seriously this game is lacking in strategic gameplay as are many of the newer Total War titles and this needs to be fixed. Furthermore, I understand if CA needs to apply to a less harcore audience but people love freedom and by giving them more options they are sure to love the game and share with their mates.

3. Need to reintroduce effective systems that have been forgotten whilst keeping the new ones (this links to 2.) because it seems unrealistic that a province has enough people to produce 8 stacks in about a year.

4. Don't get me wrong this is a bloody great game and deserves credit and I definately recommend to you if you don't own it already. The graphics whilst hard to work and optimize and times can turn out beautiful if you know what you are doing.

5. Take all of this with a pinch of salt, everyone has different tastes and so think and watch gameplay before you make the decision to buy it. Seriously, if you don't think it suits you maybe you might want to look at the other Total War titles and see if any of them suit your taste, if not don't feel forced to buy it you might regret it.

6. If you do play keep supporting CA in making the players come first, once again, I know money is important but you need to remind them that a majority of us are experienced players and want better products, not more of them.

7. Finally, if you thought I had some good ideas you might want to check out some other Total War youtubers who have the same good ideas such as The Legend of Total War, Pixelated Apollo, etc.

+ Total War Attila for me retains or reintroduces some of the best gameplay elements the series ever introduced (e.g. family and skill trees), while adding some well thought-out innovations (e.g. the horde mechanics). 
+ Most factions are interesting, based on units selected from different general rosters and several to many (depends on the faction) unique units. 
+ As befitting the time period the starting strengths of the factions range from one province to an empire, leading to very different gameplays.

- I concede, as many other Total War fans before me, that the AI is unfortunately one of the weaknesses in the series.

0 (neutral) It's hard not to be angry at SEGA for its DLC policy for several of the recent Total War titles. Attilla is no exception. Some DLC packs (Vikings, Longbeards) simply don't contain enough unique new content to justify their price. Others however (Desert Kingdoms, Celts) added some of my personal favourite factions into the game and are worth every cent. Also I would have been glad to pay some money for a DLC to add some additional siege warfare units.

Rome 2 was incredible, but this is better in most senses of the word.

I played through as the Saxons and the first 50 turns were murderously difficult to get larger, having to re-do maybe 30 saves amongst 50 turns.

-Horde and Nomad system is cool
-Music is great
-Voice acting amazing

Cons
-Even though it looks exactly the same as Rome II it runs like Steven Hawkin in the 100m sprint, at worst on Rome i got 40fps on this it never goes above 30
-God awful untit selection, about 14 differnt units 10 of which are common to all factions
-Exactly the same animations as Rome II, no new ones
-Historical setting is just boring compared to the likes of Ancient Rome, Medieval Europe, Colonial and Napoleonic Era or Fuedal Japan (my opinion)

Granted i haven't played this long but the whole time i did i just though i could be playing Rome II, a much better though not the Best Total War. Im only glad Attila cost me £7 do not paying the non sale price  it is not worth it.

The AI (both campaign and battle) is greately improved from Rome 2, this fact combined with additional challenge from the huns and an overal darker atmosphere in the game make for a very enjoyable experience. It's one of the rarer TW titiles where the player actually feel the challenge or even can lose completely if get a little incautious. 

The grand campaign replayability is very good; those who say otherwise should at least achieve a major victory as WRE/ERE, a migrating nation and the huns/white huns and then look at their steam hours counter. The last roman and age of charlemagne dlc's are a must buy (just wait for a sale if don't want to spend all too much) and a real addition to the game; especially charlemagne could've been easily a standalone title à la ""the last samurai"" for shogun 2.

-AI is average, with certain moments of brilliance but mostly does stupid stuff, like throwing mass numbers of units at you
-Diplomacy is pretty usless, but the AI does seem to uphold their bargains if you do not have good relations with their enemies
-The campaign AI is better than the battle one but it's hard to get him to coordinate an attack, almost impossible
-Some factions are to easy to play as or at least I find them that way, like Aksum by the end of my campaign I had millions but not enoth food to build and develop because of the fertility mechanism

Overall I recommend this game, it is a good strategy game, CA did try to spice up the recipe for this total war and for the most part it worked. If you can get past it's flaws it is a gem and you will be spending alot of your time in it if you like the total war franchise.
If this is the first total war game you try and don't like it, don't be afraid to try another total war because the mechanics in others are different from this one.

Only flaws I find is you still cant select a capital like Medieval2, unless your a horde, and too many factions have similar load outs, so if your a german faction, fighting other germans, you know what theyre gonna bring to the fight and how to win, so its almost a hands down battle before its even begun.

93,18052894,english,"""Teething problems"" is the best way to describe this title if you're after a two-word summary. After a rocky start, Attila managed to position itself as one of the better Total War titles, not quite up to the overall standard of Shogun II but heads and shoulders above offerings like Rome II.

As always with Creative Assembly, the biggest problem(s) do not come from the slightly poor optimization, the weird bugs (game can't close fully upon exiting and needs to be manually shut down from the task manager), but instead from their (and SEGA's) decision to nickle and dime every tiny scrap of content no matter how minute and insignificant. Just to unlock existing factions you're asked to get your wallet. In previous titles, defeating said nations was what unlocked them. This created a reason to play and try more different nations. No longer. Now everything has a price tag.

 I recommend it first and foremost for the mods which are being made for it, even though CA did not make it easy for the communities to do so. But with all DLC installed, the game does provide a very pleasing, varied experience with plenty to do and try.

98,26756124,english,"Total war Attila is the 9th installment in the Total War franchise. Following the comercial and eventually critic success of Rome 2 Attila seem to be a very solid follow up to Rome 2, well after the trailers that is. Before I get into the pros and cons of Attila lets talk about the setting first. Attila is set in the late 300's till the mid late 400's ad, it follows the breakup and eventual end of the Roman empire at the hands of the fercious Nomadic warlord Attila. As with all total war games you can pick a faction to play as such as Huns, Romans, Vandals etc... and lead them through this time period. This time period though is one of the well apocolyptic times in history as barbarians storm western civilization, the earth cools leaving nothing to eat, people scramble over the leftovers of fallen kingdoms with bow and sword, and one more small thing only the scourge of god is now suddenly destroying all of settled civlization with millions of warriors leaving nothing in his wake but death and destruction. Sounds like the perfect recipe for a total war game right right? well just keep reading. Since we got that out of the way below I have a list of pro and cons and from there you can make your own decision.

CONS; Attila is far from a perfect game and below I will list my cons about the game.

Very lacking and similar unit rosters; Just look at the goths, vandal, and frankish rosters, yeah its bad.

More aggresive Huns; The huns in this game are well the center of the whole game and it makes me boil when the Hunnic AI sends maybe a stack or two to attack me and then kinda just sits there and just moves on. That was the biggest problem with my west rome campaign the huns were just disapointing.

Dumb Ai; In total war games it is not common to see ok AI but something happened in attila insted of better ai, The ai just gets ridiculous buffs. The ai still does dumd things like send the general first or suicide there units one at a time. When i ment total war needs better ai i didn't mean dumb ai With spartan stats.

Campaign map ai; all i will say for this is. Why would the franks raze all there neighbors and then take and keep territories in arabia? 

Polotics and Diplomacy; In this game the politics is bare bones along with its diplomacy. When a Govenor has low loyalty all you do is press the secure loyalty button, and when you go into diplomacy with another nation no diplomats need to be send or anything, yop are always in constant contact with other people across the map it is like each leader has a smart phone with a few options: Declare war Make Peace Trade, and be my bitch.

Now that i have bashed this game half to death time to talk about good things in the game.

PROS:

Graphics; nothing else needs to be said

Horde Mechanic; The horde mechanic allows your faction to roam the map without a settlement you build large tent cities and dont have to worry about pesky city mangement. You can raze whole empires and keep the wealth all to your self.

Family Tree; For the first time since Medevil 2 family trees are back you can now it matters who rules your kingdom. You can marry into families and make alliances with them and if you play your cards right you just might inherit that land.

DLC well some of; DLC's in total war recently have been flakey, some are good and some just suck. In this game Empire of sands, Age of Charlemange, the last Roman, and the Celtic DLC bring much needed flavor to the main campaign, and in two of thoose cases whole new campaigns that in Charlemange case is better than the grand campaign. 

Razing Cites; This campaign feature in my opinion is essential to the game especially for the nomads, and also the campaign graphics of a razed area is awesome.

Mods; This is the saving and high point of Attila. From unit mods to whole new campaigns you can find almost everything you need or want.

After that you can make your own decision on the game about the game, but i personally think this is still a solid game. Hope i can help I give Attila Total War a 3.9/ 5.0 or a 82/100 or even a B.",1479865906,1479866191,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198112847199,32,3,29626,0,16285.0,1592523826,,
99,18216130,english,"UPDATE: I felt like it was wrong to not go back and update my reviews for this and Rome 2. After experiencing the main campaign, the Last Roman, and Age of Charmelagne, I can say that this is an amazing portrayal of the Dark Ages. After playing through them you will understand why Atilla could not simply be an expansion to Rome 2. It is a completely new age and CA made the right decison by making a new stand-alone game. And of course the modders have taken this game to a new level and even offer a Medieval campaign. I cannot wait to build my new PC and experience it. Very few games are enjoyable even when you're not the one playing, but I could watch custom made Historical battle videos all day long. Whether your goal is to restore the glory of Rome or wage a scorthed-earth campaign with the Huns, this is the best battles have ever been in the series. CA didn't mess around with the campaign here but I would like to see some new mechanics (There are plenty just coming from Rome 2 but honestly none that are truly amazing). This is the next step forward in the series and CA may have chosen to go the Warhammer route to give this and Rome 2 more time to breathe. With the amount of mods and factions available that I have never played with, I am not compaining. But eventually CA needs to go back through every single TW title and consolidate the greatness from each one into a truly life-changing game. END OF UPDATE




Impressions at the year 411 A.D. with the Hun's faction:
This is the most refreshing and enjoyable campaign experience in quite some time for this series. The initial challenge is daunting and I restarted many times because there is alot to learn and you are not given much breathing room. I finally had a good start and am now in Atilla's teenage years with a nice path of destruction cut through the Northern tribes. The Hun's are very unique in that they do not enter settlements; they drain, pillage, and destroy. On the battlefield, their missile cavalry is one of the most fun units to command the series has ever had. They are very responsive and stay out of melee while simultaneously delivering effective fire. I am very excited to see how the campaign turns out. CA has definitely listened to feedback and this is an improvement over Rome II in every aspect (presentation, graphics, audio, gameplay, interface).",1443340360,1479754099,True,1,0,0.470268279314041138,0,True,False,False,76561198028271740,187,50,17013,0,14732.0,1557765153,,

Do not buy this game.

For someone who has played every Total War game since the original Shogun, this is probably the best Total War besides Rome I, Shogun 2, and Medieval II. As far as personal historical bias goes, this is absolutely the best total war there's ever been.

So why not a buy it recommendation? Well, to put it frankly, the game does not work on Windows 10. Period. End of statement. I have tried numerous fixes to get it to work, and nothing has helped. A look at the official Total War forums shows post upon post of people desperately trying to fix the game so that it will launch (Hint: The game won't even get to the main menu on Win 10). Practically none have been answered. The few that have only offer ""have you turned your computer on/off"" level replies from CA reps, which is beyond insulting. To summarize, they can't even be arsed to patch the game to be playable.

So, in short, do not buy this game. It is not worth your time to bend over backwards with workarounds that don't work, for a developer that doesn't care enough to patch a bug they likely could fix relatively easily. And as a result, I would recommend not buying any of their products, as CA have only gotten worse in their track record of buggy, unbalanced games that rarely get the patches and fixes they desperately need (See: Rome II: Total war).

25,26359179,english,"I think overall this game is an okay game. Why is this review negative then? Well, it is very simple: I already own Total War: Rome 2 and I can safely say: STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME. It is horrible. It is not worth buying, heck it was not worth making! This game has the same graphics as Rome 2, okay plot, adds nothing significant to the table and fails on simple things like TEXT. HOW DO YOU MESS UP TEXT!? IT IS THE MOST BASIC THING YOU CAN MAKE. EVEN I KNOW HOW TO WRITE. But anyway, lets disect into this pile of ****:

1. The graphics. No effort was made to make them better. The old same, which I already own. NEXT!

2. When I said plot, what I ment was this: The plot of the game is that: ""Huns are coming! RUN AWAY!"" Look. I like Roman history. I like the story of the huns coming and running through the villages and forcing people out of their homes to move to the area of the crumbling Roman empire as much as the next guy, but other than that, theres nothing to it. It is the best way to start a game, with your entire country running away from the conquerors and you desperately trying to save yourself, but... okay it is pretty awesome. Move straigh to point 3.

3. Nothing new significant is added. Oh look, there is religion! How do you exacly change your religion or can you perceture other religions? Can I get public order bonus from it? (yes). Religion is basically like taking over your enemieses land, the people hate you because you're not one of them. It dosen't play into the game. You don't go around doing religious stuff. It was a missed opportunity.

4.  Text. TEXT. Look, most if not all the basic text is okay. Faction, the amount of money you have, what province are you in, what are your armies called etc. But those annotations, I don't know what they're called but you know? Those annotations like ""A faction has been destroyed"" or ""A new javelin man has been created"". You know those? Those. The text is... I can't even describe it. It is... the background is a paper. The paper is wrapped up and shoved up your ass and the shat you and now you have a wringly pile of shit paper. Take that and slap some ""Font 12 Calibri"" text on it and see how great it looks. MAKE. A. SOLID. BACKGROUND. Don't try to make that paper look ""realistic"" make it readable. I would rather play an historically inaccurate game that I can read rather than a game which I can't.

Biggest mistakes of the game:
1. DLC. STOP WITH THE DAMN DLC.
2. TEXT. MAKE IT MORE READABLE.
3. GIVE ME SOMETHING WORTH MY MONEY. Even if you fixed all the other issues, theres stil lone huge problem for me: ITS NOR WORTH MY MONEY. There is nothing new that makes the gave worth my money. Tell me, what significant changes are there to make this game worth buying? This game feels like a mod. A damn mod to Rome 2. It is a shame. I expected more from you CE. Shame on you CE.

(ex. melee cav > shock cav, melee/shock cav > sword inf, sword inf > spear inf, spear inf > melee/shock cav)
+Good morale system (just like M2TW where you can win/lose because of a chain rout)
+Family trees
+40-unit per side battles
+Highlights the power of cavalry charges, and artillery units
+All cav can dismount (though I don't use this, it must be available for realism)

Aside from the gameplay, graphics are excellent.
Attila is a solid game, with or without mods. First TW I ever played was Medieval 1, but I also tried Shogun 1. Ranking in my opinion:

brain dribble \/


I couldn't figure out the polictical system for the longest time, the controls for that whole thing just felt wrong.
also, it should be noted that I ignored politics completely with no negative side affects in several plays. one time I took over england and just kinda hung out for like 30 years, Atilla, was never a threat and just kida wondered around spain the whole time not attacking anyone.
I never had any revolts
auto resolved any battles as the combat was painful at best, in one case I backed up a row of spearmen on the game boarder and laughed as I waited the enemy out and won.  The enemy ABSOLUTELY would not attack me head on and instead wasted 59 minutes mashing all 5000 of his guys agaisnt the battle boarder in a futile attempt to get behind my 200ish guys. (the only tactic it seems to do by the way.....)

all the units are samey mobs. and feels more like a giant rock/paper/wet napkin contest, with numbers having more value than unit experience, outfit, or unit type ( short of archers who just melt away when the wind blows )

AI will not attack cities unless they are empty. nor will they create powerful stacks to use in any meaningful way. 
diplomacy is non existant. I defied odds on several occasions and made allies with atilla. effectivetly breaking the game as i could ally lock the whole map in a just a few short years.

objectives kinda suck....survive till XXXX? really? you think its soo hard to just be alive that it's my goal?
also, IMO, the extended goals are kinda lame too, most didn't fit with how I wanted to play and the whole system just feel half baked.

just to make sure I wasn't being jaded I loaded up several older total war games.
after playing Shogun for 20 minutes and getting WRECKED by the normal AI I can safely say that Atilla is somehow just as bad as ROME II...but thats just the thing...I had more fun with ROME II than this despite it being ""worse"".....maybe I AM just a bitter old man.....
******plays Rome I.******.......
....Nope, even rome one is leaps and bounds better despite looking like outdated poo, lol

Recently i went back and played some Rome, then Medieval 2.  
 
As much as i enjoyed those games at the time, they can also be very frustrating to play, having played a good deal of Attila at this point.  
Spending so much time building, building, building.. by late game, it's all you do for 95% of your turn in most of the earlier games/  
in Attila this problem is largely solved by the provincial building system and limited building slots (introduced in Rome II) 
 
This game fixes and improves many problems from Rome II and adds a some very interesting new features.   
Despite what you may read elsewhere (that all games after medieval 2 sucked), personally i can't really deal with playing the older games anymore, due to the high level of micro management and building, building, building, building.  
 
Rome II over simplified and on release was buggy as hell and had those god awful capture the flag ideas.  
Attila Takes what did work in Rome II, keeps the design and play through relatively simple and not too bogged down with building, unlike earlier games. It also in my opinion fixes most of what did not work in Rome II. 
 
Also the battles are the best in the series.

As you lead your beleaguered hordes across the map, making enemies wherever you go, once you finally find a place that you can call home for a while really is rewarding and it invests you in the story of your tribe.  As someone who mainly plays RPGs, this was really neat for me.

The performance is even worse than ROME II, hell why don't you just support and fix ROME II instead making a basically same game but with Family Tree as the only addition ?
Unit Collision only improved slightly, the kill animation is now less than ROME II but still the battle pitched one on one animation between soldiers, that alone ruins the dynamism of the battle. 

MONEY

You want to cash out more money from us that want Family Tree !

It's a shame the practical business you do SEGA. 

Just, just don't buy this game, If you have ROME II, you will get similar experience but with worse performance.

Update : Even at this late, there is no more patch or fix. The performance is very atrocious, way more so than ROME II. CA really abandons this game. Lesson learned painfully, I will never again give my money to all of CA / SEGA product. The truly great Total War titles are from 2000 until 2007, after that it goes downhill and just a cash cow of the franchise.

Mark my word : They simply don't care if their games are optimised or not as long as they get your money and this policy will continue to their future product as well.",1435905301,1474510778,False,2,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False,76561198055362602,113,33,7044,0,6529,1481303004,,

84,25595679,english,"Attila TW is probably the most frustrating to play out of the entire TW series
Why?
[b]CITY MANAGEMENT[/b]
The entire premise of city management is balancing population ""public order"" (happiness) and resource production
City buildings give maybe 1-5 happy while it costs 30= food each season
Building food producing buildings causes social unrest for some reason, offsetting the happiness gained from your city building. To cover this you need to build ""communal grounds"" which give +public order but costs enormous food consumption. Building industry also causes enourmous unrest. Trying to balance this will plunge your cities into social unrest very quickly.
Food is shared amongst your entire empire, but individual regions suffer unrest if they aren't producing enough food for themselves, making it very difficult to see where the food is being produced and who needs it the most. You have to station a full army stack in a region to give enough public order to come out even. Sending this army out to do army stuff will often cause negative order and will cause a rebellion if not stationed back in the city soon.

[b]Battles[/b]
One stack vs one stack battles are normal and mostly problem free. The problems arise when four or five armies (stacks) do battle. Auto resolve lets the game resolve the battle without playing them. Unless you have a huge numbers superiority it is almost always better to play them yourself. When you have more than one army, the game only lets you control one army at a time, with units trickling in from the borders (often far enough away that they will have no effect on the main combat). If you need certain units that could turn the tide for you, like cavalry, archers or seige engines you are unable to choose your army makeup before or during setup.

[b]THE HUNS[/b]
The main antogonists of the game, they will rampage through the map razing any cities in their way. So what can you do against them? Almost nothing really, when you have one stack in your borders and they do the plundering thing, your food production can be crippled, causing famine and decimating your armies very fast. When the Huns have no other target except you, expect 4 or 5 death stacks ready to seige you. If you like getting BTFO at turn 150 then you might enjoy the game. Battle AI for the huns is really cheesy as well. If you are in terrain advantage like a steep hill, the huns will refuse to attack you and will sit in thier deployment zone and not move. If you move against them they will use mobility and encircle you and surely win. Waiting out a 60 minute battle on x3 acceleration is not fun. On th ecampaign map if you find a lone stack of huns and can beat them, they will retreat farther than you can follow them, even if they are completely surrounded by stacks, they will still be able to run away.

This game even has a certain degree of customization, you can name your armies, pick their battle standard, choose the traditions such as increased attack, higher income from raiding, decreased to no attrition from winter conditions and much much more. You can also rename cities, and villages. Every decision you make has good or bad consequences. Choosing to name another man within the family tree your heir and disinheriting your current heir causes a drop in loyalty. To much disloyalty can lead to a civil war and a separatist off shoot faction of your own faction. Sacking a settlement vs occupying can get you riches but lead to provincial instability. Moving your army from a city or town to invade another faction or fight a battle can lead to victory and the capture of new lands, yet leaving your lands unprotected open the way for other armies to invade wreaking havoc amongst your lands. This game is all about strategy, well thought out choices, and finding the balance between military, economic, religious, political, and many other things concerned with the success of your kingdom, empire, nation, etc. I recommend this game to any one that enjoys history, watching armies fight bloody battles sometimes down to the last man, and feeling like the ruler of your own faction. I have logged countless hours in this game, conquered 75% of the map as the Saxons, and played several other campaigns as the Visigoths, Picts, Alemans and Langobards, (my favorite factions tend to be Germanic tribes due to their fierce warriors), but all of the factions have their perks.

3,25354689,english,Even though this game is alot better then Total War Rome2 its still one of the worst total war games I've played. It goes as follows. Medieval Total War 2 being the best total war game Total War Rome being second then came Empire Total War. Empire is the start of huge problems with total war they changed alot including the AI going from being bad to being insane and just not making sense plus being bad. Then when Rome 2 came out the techs sucked the AI is terrible bc if you want to improve AI the AI can't just make random choices. It ruins the game. I've noticed each time you restart a campaign with the same faction AI's have a sort of random opinion of you. You never know when or why someone will attack you bc its completely random and has no sense behind it. Atilia has these problems just like Rome 2 people asked for a better AI. So SEGA gave them a worse AI that magically make 5 stack armors out their ass. AIs that don't have any limits. They don't seem to be limited by money at all. Oh ya and whats all fun is getting gang banged by every single faction around you to the point that all you can do is sit in your cities and defend as the AI just plants 2 stack armies outside of every cities you own and just sits there so you can't move anywhere. Then another faction close to you declares wars on you and does the same freaking thing. I mean if the objective is creating an AI that makes random choices and just does everything to you to make the game as little fun as possible CA has created a great game with a great AI. Honestly I think its a terrible game with a really good idea and graphics. They failed so hard on things like AI and I don't mean in battles. The AI is good in battles but map decisions.

-Settlement destruction during battles is something that past Total War games have been desperately missing, and it is pretty great to watch a town burn as you besiege it. Same goes for lighting a forest on fire with your enemies inside of it during land battles. 
-The diplomacy system seems significantly better than previous games.

Although the setting is very good, playing as the huns is alot of fun, but there's alot of factions who feel like reskins of another for instance the Saxons and the Franks, these two factions are way too similar and I would have liked playing as somebody who is a bit further away.


The DLC is stupid the only one I bought was the Empires of sand, and even then they all feel the same, so many good factions that could've made the game so much better were put behind a price tag so CA could make some more money but also upset their loyal fans.

Anyways, the game itself, out of the context of these issues, is the best total war game I’ve ever played.  And I’ve played Rome, Shogun 2, Medieval 2, Empire, and Napoleon.  All of them pale in comparison. It’s hard to explain—there’s so many weird new mechanics that mesh in a way like never before.  At times, it makes even Rome seem clunky.  In a lot of ways it's a new kind of strategy game.  It's sort of like Endless Legend in that it takes the idea of faction survival even further, but it's a way better game than that game.  You’re not just fighting to paint the map your color and gain more and more and more till you win.  You’re fighting, in many cases, to see that your people survive, to see your culture live another season.  This makes migration a huge part of this game.  Sometimes you have to abandon your settlements and move West.  Where will you settle?  Who will you meet along the way?  How will you deal with the Roman empire?  Its got that incredible sense of adventure—in a strategy game which is bonkers to me.

The first like seven to ten hours of the game are a bit of a mess.  You might think, oh, I am TW vet and I know how to play this.  But it's oddly different.  Soon you’ll be humbly retreating to the wiki for information on a general’s cunning, or authority, or what integrity does for an army, or how loyalty works, or how to reduce squalor in a city.  Maybe this is because I neglected to play Rome 2, but it was a bit of a wall at first.  My advice: Get your self over that wall! Push through! Read up on it! Because once you do, once you are past that seven to ten hours, you are going to have a game with its own breed of emergent storytelling like no other.  The abundance of extra character stats and details adds layers of complexity to gameplay and character, and is surprisingly not overburdening like it is in Endless Legend.  It’s very dense, and yet easy to interrupt once you’ve learned it.  The interface is a bit of struggle, but not entirely unwieldily.  And once you’ve done all that learning, suddenly the game becomes about the story of your people, their resistance, their tenacity to survive, and the harsh winters and Huns that chase you from your home.  The mechanics make that narrative smooth, intricate, and nuanced to play through.  And there's never a sense of BS randomness.  You know lack of sanitation buildings runs the risk of disease every turn.  You know your general's loyalty has been waning lately.  You know starvation and winter leads to attrition for your men's numbers.

The battles are fantastic.  Short, but tactical and sweet.  Horse archers are gods, btw.  It’s an intricate game every time between the eastern Calvary factions and the Infantry focused germanic peoples.  Spears versus raw speed.  It’s about how to untangle a knot, and thread a needle with careful maneuvering.  Each unit checks and balances each other.  But some come with nasty surprises, like war-dogs, or bows on spearmen.  The complexity makes Shogun’s simple Spear, Sword, Calvary set up look childish. It’s got an amazing battle map.  Plus, in custom battle, you can select ANY location on the map to fight in.  Wanna replay a specific river crossing from a campaign you had?—mark in the map.  Amazing!

I don’t know how to describe this happy accident CA made.  I hate most of the stuff they make (except Rome and Shogun II)—because most of their games error on the side of being rather bland and thematically simplistic: conquer here and there kind of stuff.  But this is a true gem, in that it breaks the tradition of most strategy games.  The world is falling apart.  A cold is coming, fertility in lands is dropping, and the Huns are coming to sack everyone.  It embraces this part of history like no other game.  It takes its sense of the world and uses that for the mechanics.  It’s so cool that this game is about running, and hiding, and trying to survive worse and worse conditions and diseases.  It wears the whole apocalyptic vibe so well.  It’s chilling and dark.  It’s hard too.  Don’t expect to steam-roll everyone.  Even Rome is crumbling, rebellions are imminent, and starvation is at your doorstep.  Keeping what you got—becomes its own challenge.  It’s more story than history.  It’s more legend and myth than it is about conquering.  It’s kind of like Crusader Kings II—except you don’t stare at a map the whole time.  If you can buy it on sale with DLC, it’s worth it my friend.  In my opinnion, it is the underrated swan song of a once great developer; perhaps, a last true spark of genius that got rushed by a desperate publisher.

21,25047749,english,"Attila Total war was quite...a experience. I have played the old total war games(Medieval 2 and Rome) but this game felt a little bit more confusing for me but got use to it. Now this is the only a nitpick and not really a bad thing but why did they have to make managing settlements more difficult? I get its a strategy game but Total war is know for its battle not settlement managing but thats my tiny annoyance. The a.i is trash and wanna know how CA fixed it? By giving them too much advantage. Honestly when a a.i attacks an army or settlement of mine they bring back up and its usually one full stack army and the other half stacked its bullshit. Not to mention when you can easily beat them they get a extra move range which becomes a fucking cat and mouse chase. Family tree feels less important since you can replace a fallen general(which I kind of like since in the old games I have to leave generals back in settlements with a garrison full plebs to maintain public order.) as well having governors to help maintain public order. The battle seems less intresting for me. Sure the kill animation is nice but I perfer seeing my troops and the enemy's troop dying at the same time in a mosh pit while a calvary charge appears out of nowhere and arrows firing all over the place. But I have to say that the units in this game has certain types of abilites as well for the generals. For example the archer units has different kinds of arrows which can be useful in certain situation like if the enemy are started to waver but not about to break, just use flamming arrow or whistle arrow since those can break morals quick or use heavy shot on well armoured units. speaking of archers I feel really annoyed when they stop firing for reason that I don't know. Maybe because they don't want to friendly fire a allie or maybe theres something in the way of their sight or its just that their stupid. The grand campagin feels more like a survival then conquering since you get objectives telling you to survive till the following date and season which I kind of mix feeling. But I do like how it makes Attila and the huns be like spawns from hell  and that you are screwed if you don't have a good units and a prepared army to take on the huns when Attila arrives and Attila is your main target. Overall this gmae gives me mix feeling and a guilty pleasure.

23,25033033,english,"This was my first Total War game and probably my favorite just because of all the Total War games, this one, in my opinion, has the most replayability and I really like the time periods they chose.
Total War Attila has just the right amount of factions (if you buy the overpriced DLC) and open ended gameplay that makes it much more playable a second time through than other games in the series. A lot of the factions are very interesting like the Roman Empire (both sides), the Huns, the Franks, etc and it's very interesting seeing swords clash between all of these factions. I would highly suggest getting the Age of Charlemagne DLC since that's where I had the most amount of fun, but I can't reccommend the Last Roman DLC since starting a new save is annoying because making Africa submit takes a lot of time. Time that I'd rather spend fighting the Ostrogoths in Italy. 
The battles could be better in this game. I find it very enjoyable since at my skill, I feel slightly better than the AI so I still have the enjoyment of winning most of the time while still feeling challenged because I have to stay on my feet. If you're a very experienced Total War player, you may miss the impact of armies colliding like they did in Rome Total War because they have a different engine that makes the armies meld together. It doesn't feel like a very physical battle when you watch the people fight. It's mostly just people jabbing their spears at the air and someone falling down every once in a while. They make you pay for blood too so if you want it to feel like a real battle, you'll need to pay for that. It's better to just focus on the tactics during battles than watch the animations. 
The games flaws include the vast amounts of overpriced DLC. Enough said. Also, the one thing that just made the game feel really lazy was that most of the soldier designs look sloppy. The way the soldiers look made the game feel so streamlined like they didn't put any work into it. Even if you pay for DLC, the soldiers still look crappy. Watch the show Vikings and compare it to the Vikings in this game. The vikings in this game look like pajama men, I'm not kidding you. It's so hard to take them seriously. Some factions have very bright clothing too so you could be faced with fighting against yellow pajama men or bright green pajama men. For the most part, if you're a barbarian faction, all the soldiers look the same, they just attached a different colored set of pajamas. Also, in the Age of Charlemagne DLC, they made Charlemagne invincible so he doens't really ""lead men into battle with honor and virtue"", he just can't die so he's not risking anything by being there with his men anyways. They should seriously change that since it does take away from the imersion of the game. 
Even though this game has a lot of flaws, I still love this game. I'm playing a game as the Lombards on hard for the first time and I do feel genuinly challenged.

40,24786511,english,"My favorite campaign map to date, with fun/enriching story campaigns (Charlemagne and Last Roman) with the same ***DLC scheme since Rome 2. You have the decline and fall of the Roman Empire at your finger tips, with many legendary leaders scheming to make their people the supreme. You have many groups running west, fleeing the rising Hun menace, and old barbarian tribes finally seeking conquest as opposed to survival. And, in the wake of such wanton conquest and the tragic demise of the great empire, The Scourge of God has been born: Attila, King of the Huns, has come to turn this world into ash. If you know the history, the map and factions are so awesome. If you don't know the history, the map is great with a plethora of factions to see and be where you can put many hours into the game.

Hordes are a revolutionary addition to Total War, with some not so savory parts to it, yet still very fun. The new sacking mechanics are a good step up from prior games, as is the new raze function. You can spend many years just roaming and looting and have a lot of fun. 

Battles remain more or elss the same, with the same development that occurs in each game, but with an increased focus on skirmish cavalry. Naval battles are still the same, with land and sea battles/sieges still a thing. Navies are hefty on upkeep, and kinda not worth it considering few factions use boats or have to embark and travel via the sea.

The refined family system is great, with some new emphasis on characters and familial/tribe actions. I like it.

This game, it's good. The best single player Total War that ever was or will be (sorry Warhammer, not really interested). Multiplayer still remains in the hands of Shogun 2, sorry Attila.

52,24677304,english,"If you ever have a chance, go back to the original Rome: Barbarian Invasion. The gameplay in my opinion is very different. There are a lot of added features. 

I will recommend this game, but I'm going to poke some holes in it. 

The base AI machanic is broken. The AI will just stack armies on their cities, and sit there forever. 
The unit list from faction to faction isn't too different. But in reality, the armies weren't too much different to begin with. 
The DLC. In my optinion, there shouldn't any, or as many DLC. If there was, let it be one very big DLC, thats the way it used to be.

Now, what other people don't say is this, In the steam workshop, there are thousands of mods for this game. 
Some are for fun, and others do thier best to fix/improve the game's machanics. There are tons of mods that add so much to the game.  

I play the game with a lot of mods. It mades the game better then it started out. The mods I use arn't completely changing the game, they are just making it better. Like fixing the AI stacking 5 armies on 1 city. 

You can put a lot of hours into this game. If you want a true look at the game, go to YouTube, and watch someone play it, both on the map, and a battle. 

The rest of this is my experience with mods. 

One thing I will say about the mods. If you are putting mods on, and trying to make your saved game work, you might have some issues, like it not working. It depends on how major the mod is. Also, if you are using mods, never delete a mod while trying to use your save, that will start crashing the game, when you load the save. I've lost 2 saved games I had about 100 hours in both. I know, what it does. 

My best thing to say is, start a new game if you are going to mod. If mods conflict too much, the game will start crashing in the loading screen (when you start the game). Nothing bad about the mods, this is just my experience, from spending 4 hours trying to figure out why I was crashing. lol

One last thing about adding mods to a modded save. What I did is this, I added a mod, tried to play my save. If it worked, awesome, if it didn't you just remove the mod you just put on and it will work again. :)

I dreamed of being a knight and commanding my warriors to great victory, watching big armies clash and charge into battle as the calvary obliterates the archers and unprotected infantry. I found that dream in total war. Attila was my first experience, I spent hours bringing forth a kingdom for my Saxon brotheren and struggling to ward off the evil huns. I loved it, played the crap out of it, but then I played a different faction and loked for more total war games. I was amazed at the other eras and peoples and cultures. It's a very fun game and it sucks you in when you first play it.

But there are some thing I dislike very much, I don't feel like there is much replayablility, yes there are lots of other factions, but it's just build a city and amass a few armies and the world is yours. I feel like it's only a challange even on hard difficulties in the beginning as the AI is relentless. You get to apoint where all you have to do is mop up little factions and worry about the annoying huns, they aren't a challange it's just an bothersome thorn in your side. And Dont forget the DLC issues, just google it and you will find out.

63,24325466,english,"At first blush, Attila was a little disappointing because its superficially so similar to Rome 2, same army animations etc. However, once you play more than a few turns, this disappears and it is truly a totally different and much, much better game. 

There are some questionable design decisions, for example virtually every faction gets similar units (but there is still a wide diversity) eg saxons get pikemen, lancers, and cavalry that are good at attacking other cavalry despite having none of these historically.  However there's so much unit choice and such a wide diversity of units (especially when you start recruiting client state/horde units) that they're all fun to play as + I find the combat far more complex. Different factions have different stats, for example Barbarians have high attack but generally lower defence and armour, while with Roman units its the other way around.  Roman units get chewed up by barbarians, so you need to play quite tactically with them now and make full use of terrain and your Levis Armaturae and cavalry. Especially appreciated is the (finally!) addition of a 'missile block chance' for all units.  This is so good it would be impossible to go back to a time without it, and I have NO idea why it wasn't in Rome 2 (what were they thinking???).

But now to the gameplay. People have complained that all the factions are 'the same' but in truth I really don't see this. Excluding DLC, there are four main playstyles,  'Roman', 'Germanic Barbarian' (eg Suebi, Visigoths), 'Eastern' (Sassanid, Garamantians), and 'Nomadic' (Huns, white huns) etc but each plays very differently, and further playstyle differences are added even between factions depending on their religion (which actually makes a real difference in terms of buildings and effects now), whether they're a horde or not, and differing units. I've completed games on hard as ERE, WRE, Saxons, Sassanids, Garamantians, and White Huns. Horde tribes are a real challenge, since your city travels with you, and I haven't mastered this yet.   I found legendary difficulty too awkward because of the pause-delay that gets added to all of your actions from the auto-save, so I play only on hard or very hard.

I'm currently playing the absolute best campaign of my 10 years playing total war  (i've played all TWs except the first shogun) as Western Roman Empire on Very Hard.  An early decision to hold one province too many (Belgica) rather than falling back to Narbonensis as I usually do, as well as a subsequent (still early) decision to switch to Graeco Roman paganism stretched my empire to the absolute breaking point. I spent until 417AD  'treading water' fighting battle after battle, marching my legions all over hells half acre to put down rebellions, fight off rampaging hordes, et cetera. Along the way I lost my alliance with the ERE and had no other trade allies or client states, so it was tough. It also played out very diffierently to an identical campaign on hard. I didn't get my usual economic buildings built early because I had to spend on troops, so I was behind from the get-go. 

After I wearied my foes enough I was able to sign a stack of peace agreements but I was busy for many more years putting down rebellions and spending spare cash (that now wasn't being spent on soldiers) building buildings. Now in 422 AD, I've stabilised my religion, have taxes stably on high (its a net benefit to public order once all the immigrants are gone) and I control all of italia, north africa, hispania, most of france and most of britain with the Varinians as my client state in Scotland. The thing is, even with 12 legions my empire is still stretched to the max as I have hordes through the interior, the franks have 4 provinces and a few stacks near colonia agrippina, i have five or six hun hordes, rugians and another horde faction hanging all around illyria and in my interior, and I have the garamantians (who have 8 regions) on my border in Africa.  I have two legions in Britain keeping that pacified, two in gaul, one in hispania, two in Africa, three in north italy/illyria, and my expeditionary legion is sailing towards Aksum under Flavius Stilicho (he just died, now its his son) to keep the ERE happy. 

I can't move any of those legions for fear of attack, and now the Gaetulians in Cydamus have launched an attack with three full stacks on my two under-manned (saving $$ on garrison expenses) African legions - there's some tough fights coming up. I'm surprised the garamantians haven't pitched in yet, since they're at war with ERE but mercifully neutral (yellow face) happiness with me.  On the same turn, my former clients, the Saxons, seceded and declared war.  Unfortunately they helped me wipe the Visigoths out of Greece and Constantinople, and they captured much of the ERE's former territories, so they're quite a threat. Ordinarily I'd get Macedonia (Roman, graeco-roman pagan, religiously tolerant, admires empires, reliable, defensive) to help me sort them out since they're pliable and also control four regions in illyria, but since they're at war with the ERE (which holds virtually all of the middle east except Egypt, having for once wiped out the Sassanids) I can't do that either and I'm likely to be at war with macedon soon also.  

Words don't do it justice but its an incredibly engaging campaign.  One word of advice if its achievable on harder difficulties (for all campaigns really, not just WRE) is to crank your taxes up to high. Initially it will hurt public order so you should try not to be at war,  but you can save yourself up to -18 (or is it 20?)  (-9 as WRE) in immigration penalties.  Normal taxes give -4 to public order, high taxes give -10.  So you spend 6 public order to gain 9 public order as well as a huge increase in income. It's a great idea but I think its a bit too beneficial to the player once you can pull it off.  

Whew, that degenerated mostly into my WRE experience but honestly, I don't know if this is the 'best' total war ever as I've had a lot of fun with all of them,  but it is really a phenomenal game, is much better than Rome 2, and i feel sets a new high water mark for the series.  I downloaded the last roman campaign but only played 3 hours so far (seems fun, loving the later time period and new units) and i have the empires of sand DLC but i haven't finished a campaign with it yet.  I tried a couple of starts and the new units definitely make Himyar and Aksum more threatening and the Tanukhids seem like a lot of fun, but I always got stomped early as the Tanukhs. (instead play as ERE and recruit their awesome cavalryt!) . Do recommend.

**EDIT** I have subsequently edited this review after discovering some problems.  There are several bugs in the game that are unresolved and are unlikely to be resolved by CA. They're a little devious but can have a very profound effect on gameplay. The first is that a number of traits and retinues appear to have no effect - especially those that give +exp to units. Pankration gloves etc are entirely useless.  Also there is an easily reproducible bug where faction members that remarry the wife of another dead faction member will disappear, yet still be available for employment as a general.  you can never give them offices etc so eventually they accumulate a huge amount of influence and revolt leading to a separatist conflict. There are other problems in charlemagne such as not being able to recruit archers after researching a certain cavalry tech....these bugs have been around for a long time and aren't going to be fixed. This knocks a lot of the gloss off my review - but I tried going back to Rome 2 today and Attila still beats it by an order of magnitude. Also, the encyclopeia isa piece of shit that doesn't load half the time and takes an age to navigate when it does. Its obscure, difficult to use and doesnt make life easier. Some stats like rate of fire should be on the main unit card not encyclopedia.",1468545132,1469768627,True,31,2,0.721323609352111816,0,True,False,False,76561198027377779,56,18,45121,0,18694,1563530883,,

The units play exactly how they should, and tactics are more important than army size in most cases. (which leads to very long and unique battles). You always have to be on your toes and ready to drop your current battle plan and ready for a secondary one.

65,24586669,english,"What i can say about Rome Attila.     final verdict  Buy if its on sale its 100% worth it now.

(THE GOOD)  one it is much more exciting then Rome 2.   Rome2 was good after patched up for over a year but it lacked political struggle.    Rome Attila add it back now family member are very valuable and you are on the constant look out of other powerful characters becoming annoyed with your rule.     Every true ruler in history had to deal with internal problems as well as external.    This game is a good step in the right direction.   Attila adds one more enemy that we today have become aware off.  That is Climate change.     The European dark ages was made darker because of a mini ice age that lasted 300 years or more.      On top of black plague and you can see why it was hard for Anyone to even hold a minor empire together let alone something as huge as Rome.  This makes every choice much more interesting makeing every game a more cacualted game of choices that can change everything.

(The worst)   Every single game that even has total war on the title should be meet with suspicion. Due to horrible launches and pay walls. ID recommend wait about 1 year or more before buying any new game coming out other wise you will only see bugs and or problems that should not exist. We are tired of buying alphas game developers we really are!

(The bad)   
One I can say i really wish you could move your capital would not care if there was requirements needed before doing this you will find this annoying as well when you play.   
Unlike other total war games playing the Rome Faction in this one is like asking to be frustrated because its very hard in comparison to any other game.  Climate ,Enemies, and internal struggle will keep you defensively 90% of the time.  IF you don't defend you ask for total collapse of your empire because every providence destroyed by people like the Huns create unrest in your whole empire.     So don't expect a walk in the park this time. 
Hordes get away with murder too easily and should also be affected by climate when they are not as much if at all.
                (the bad in every TW game)
The AL is bad  but the AI is always bad never expect this to actually change because even modded AI really don't do it right.  So if your expecting a computer challenge form a total war game.  LOL why are u even playing?

Rome is huge but has like no tech and gets mauled right off the bat

Lag
Not enough playable countries

Its way to difficult to start out and you funnel hours of time to get started with a already devolped nation acting like whats a iron shield, and at that point playing is not worth the time, it would make sense for you to start with a large army thats not trained and has low morale so it makes combat harder but this game is just no.",1469430671,1469431004,False,0,1,0.47826087474822998,0,True,False,False,76561198107069603,127,7,4771,0,1900,1526968528,,
74,24502826,english,"I don't know why people put so much hate on this game, is it the setting? The factions? The gameplay? I just don't see any reason to hate this game. I played Rome II and I really enjoyed it, until I started facing problems like how the game would start but then would sit on the title page for hours. The game doesn't crashes but it doesn't progress any further, which made me very upset and now I would have to rebuy the game later. Sure, Attila may not be as good as Rome II, but it isn't bad either. Plus, Age of Charlemagne DLC is awesome, its like you're playing Medieval II all over again, except its the start of the Medieval Era with the rise of the Frankish Kingdom and the push of Islamic Dominace in Europe through the Iberian Peninsula, a setting which you never really get to experience in Medieval II since all it starts in is when William the Conqueror overthrew the Anglo-Saxon Kingdom and replaced it with the Kingdom of England in 1066. 

Anyway, back to Attila. The world for the Romans have now turned upside down, political and public unrest forced the empire to split into two, one Western, one Eastern. Christianity is the domain reilgion in the Roman minds and a corrupt senate left the Roman lands in grave danger of being vulerable to the ""Barbarians"" in the East. Rome has gone to the point where they have so much land and so much of a populance to control, that the Roman armies are overstretched, leaving the majority of land ripe for the taking. However, in the far East, a horde arrives, pillaging and murdering their way into Europe. The Barbarians are left with two choices, either flee west and claim terroritory from the Romans, or stand against this new and menacing threat that rides in from the far east. This threat will be the Huns, an Asianic tribe that relies on surviving by being mobile and living off the land. The Romans are now dealing with the Barbarians that push their way into their lands, the Barbarians now must migrate west in order to aviod this Hunnic threat and survive, while the Huns must raid and pillage in order to survive. The times of conquest is over, it is now the times for survival. Now the question remains, will Rome be spared of destruction, or will the once mighty and grand Roman Empire topple over for a new chapter in history? 

Either Rome survives, or Rome falls, the choice is yours to make...

Gameplay is pretty much the same as in Rome II, but with new options in directing a government and a larger technology tree. Graphics have very very little improvement but it is still good for a massive RTS game. The only thing that pisses me off is that you feel very limited in this game, with limited factions being playable and of course the Blood & Burn DLC, I shouldn't have to pay a dime just to get blood effects for a game. (Great JOB being money-grabbers CA) Plus, people have been complaining on why bodies disappear, just lower your graphic performance from Max down to Performance and the bodies will stay. Each culture has its own set of tactics to use against their enemies, for example, the Huns rely on mobility and speed to out flank and overrun their enemies, the Barbarians must use clever and hit and run tactics to outsmart their foes, and the Romans must rely on determination and combined-arms to repel their invaders. If you think you can resume conqueroring with Rome, trust me, you won't. Everyone outside your borders hates you and you have little armies stretched all over the Empire.

Each side of the Roman Empire have two threats of their own; the Eastern has to deal with the Sassanids and the White Huns to the East and the Visogoths and Ostrogoths to the North. the Western has to deal with both established and migrating Barbarians such as the Franks, Saxons, Nordic tribes, and migrating Suebians, and also they would have to deal with the looming threat of civil war because of intense political unrest. Sure you may start out with half of the Mediterrian Sea under your control, but as the game progresses forward, you will see your land being tore apart by too many enemies to even count. 

I do enjoy this game, but not as much as I enjoy Rome II, so this game shouldn't really get any hate (Except for the DLCs). Is it perfect? No. Does it have its problems? Yes. But thats the same deal with Rome II. Anyway, good game, but not as good as its previous. 

PS, whats with Warhammer!?! Sure, fans are happy, but to me, thats like Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare. Unrealistic and it irritates me because I love historical games. I'm not saying that Warhammer is bad, but it completly just abandon the historical feel that you get with other Total War games. I just hope that they're doing this just once. Please don't be like Call of Duty, CA please don't.

Comparison to Rome 2:

+ Better AI! yay! Now they flank.

+ Charges look better
+ There seems to be more troop variety

- There seems to be less troop variety among certain cultures
- The same voice acting. Not [i]actors[/i], I mean [b]the same exact recordings[/b].
- They removed the click and drag function to move your troops, so now you just create a box as if you're clicking and dragging on your desktop
- I used to create battle groups with CTRL + 1 (or whatever number) and now it locks the formation, definitely annoying
-+ It feels like battles are much faster due to increased kill rates. I could be wrong.

Differences from other Total War games:
- Remember when you used to be able to pick empires at different stages of history? Well, now you can't. 
[b]You are forced to play one of two HUGE empires if you want to be Roman.[/b] Not a good thing if you're new to Attila, very overwhelming. I wish you could pick a Rome where it was nearly destroyed where all you have left is Italy.
- If they read the above critique and work on it, it'll probably be released as a paid DLC.

1,24179735,english,"If you ever played the Rome expansion ""Barbarian Invasion"", then think of this as Rome 2's very own version of that expansion.
Not an awful game, but it simply feels lazy. Everyone was seemingly in a rush to get workign on Warhammer. The AI is, unlike what some people seem to beleive, possibly worse than rome 2. I have not ever been attacked by one army, it's all about the stacks, and only stacks, it's all the AI has going for it. The various factions don't have the same individual feel to them that is common place is most TW games, the building trees for too many are exactly the same or very similair. The tech tree isn't even worth talking about, not is the upgrade tree for generals/governors. Big step backwards.

The horde system (first used in Barbarian Invasion) is interesting to use when you are controlling a horde faction and can make the game better if you are one of those who do not enjoy the Empire management side of the TW games and simply look forward to the straight up murder, otherwise, it just becomes tedious having hordes camp on your land every turn and taking all of an enemies cities for him to take his horde off for a few turns and return twice as strong as he ever was.
Also, it seems that people are fond of this game, simply because it's not Rome 2, which is utterly stupid, because Rome 2 was not as bad in the end as every still claims. Rome 2 is coldplay, it's cool to hate, no matter if you secretly enjoy it.
Further cons-
Poorly optimized, even running it on a 980 ti the fps will randomly be low for a whole battle, which is not great seeing as the game doesn't look THAT good at the end of the day.
Bugs, bugs for days. Be prepared to have no reinforcing support for no apparent reason, to have random waits for the campaign make to stop acting up & have your units simply not listen to what you're telling them.
You have a choice of Romans, hordes, eastern or raiding. So if you're a racist empire lover, your options are limited.
Love cavalry? Good, you'll win.
Morale system is broken.
Skirmishing is broken
Towers are OP
Economics is too easy

What i will say for the game is this:
The Political/Family mechanics are really good, vastly improved from Rome 2, allowing for far more options as to how to accumulate and use power.
Food system is mostly better than before, still kinda dogshit though.
Good setting, genuinely feels like a time of true turmoil, rather than a bunch of nations picking on their smallest neighbours for a few hundred turns.

7,24265891,english,"I would Not recommend this game.  I've been playing Total War games since the beginning.  This one is, however, very frustrating, if not out right ruined for several reasons.  

First are the spies, priests and heroes.  They are like mosquitos. They follow your army around constantly harassing it. You spend time building up your generals. You deliberate where to spend points to best strengthen your army only to have him assassinated. So, you have to pick a new one losing all of your experience and experience points.  You can build your own to try to stop them.  For example, I built 6 only to have 5 of them assassinated in the first turn.   The other failed to assassinated the enemy spy as he always does.  They have other functions but the AI only seems interested in destroying your generals.   They will follow across the entire map.  There is no fun in this.   

Second,  when you build most buildings they have both a positive and negative effect so you have to build another building to offset the negative effect but, of course, it has a negative effect so . . .  wash, rinse, repeat.  For example, if you build a building to buff your army, such as melee, archery, etc, (positive effect) it requires a large amount of food to support (negative effect).  If you run short on food, your army will desert.  So, you build a building to make food (positive effect), but it creates squalor (negative effect).  If squalor is not fixed, then your army dies of disease so you have to build another building.  The negative effect always seem to exceed the positive so your army is never at full strength.  

The fighting part is great but you spend most of your time fixing problems and building back up your armies just so you can attack.

But I had a great time playing on the other side, fighting their invasion.

Graphically, the game is beautiful and recaptures the feeling of a battle or siege that I found was a bit lost on Rome II. The music and ambient sounds are also better that than the previous game. The menus, diplomacy and family politics are also fun to watch and play.

Still, for the future, which I hope will bring Medieval III, I ask for more historical short videos or texts, explaining fun and interesting facts ocurring in the specific years in which we are playing in-game. I also ask for a more pratical family tree. I had occasions in which I had a King that simply did not appear in the tree.

Overall, I fully recommend this game as a great addition to the series.",1468264120,1468264120,True,1,0,0,3,True,False,False,76561197981294625,247,58,9654,0,9077,1468107335,,

Battles are played out far too quickly, with little time to enact a strategy before your units disintegrate through the accelerated combat speeds. Also, the Western Roman Empire campaign is extremely boring, and there is no way of unrigging the unfair odds placed against you at any point in the campaign. Squalour system is ridiculous and not historically authentic.

11,24203141,english,"I honestly think this game gets s***t on way too much, considering its current state. The main downside it has - cheating AI in form on never-ending and poorly scripted hunnic hordes - can be removed or tweaked with mods in the workshop. It might not be worth the full price, but I very much reccomend it on sale, preferably with all the DLC. Specifics:

Pros:
+ Fun battles, more dynamic and less predictable than in Rome 2.
+ Good political system, that gives you quite a few choices on how to manage your empire and an incentive to keep your generals alive. I'll long remember the moment when my emperor became a bloodthirsty tyrant from all the war atrocities I made him commit and I had to force his wife to assassinate him.
+ Decent tech trees and settlement management - very similar to Rome 2, but better. Many people still don't like the way campaing map works, but I find it much more satisfying then in the last game, even though there's still some things that are hard to skip if you want to have lvl 4 cities and villages (try not builing fishing ports everywhere),
+ Land armies are much more vulnerable on water - not defenceless, but they won't win with a strong fleet any more, even in melee.

Cons:
- Broken OP Huns that punish you for winning: new hordes spawn immidiately after you beat previous ones, they are full of super-elite units in late game and you have to kill Attila four (!) times to make them less deadly. Can be easily fixed with mod though.
- Hordes sometimes impossible to catch - horde can wreck havoc inside you territory and is faster then normal armies, which can be infuriating (the counter arguement is that you need to have your armies strategically placed as Rome or other big entity).
- Small unit roster: all factions have fairly small unit rosters, with a lot of units you unlock being replacements of older ones rather then new options. Didn't bother me presonally, especially as Rome, as you can recruit allied barbarian levies and have a lot of mercenaries to chose from, but many people didn't like it.
- Some balancing issues: some units seem weirdly OP. I don't think germanic axe-wiedling infantry should cut through elite legionaries in defensive formation with little efford (but in a way it made the game a bit more challenging and defensive battles more involved IMO).

In summary, I think Attila in its final form is the game Rome 2 tried to be from the beginning. CA took all the major elements from that game and tweaked them to work properly. The Huns are absurd, but the modding community have you covered from that angle, you can even get them effectively out of the picture and take your reconsolidated Western Rome to a new path of conquest.

12,24192687,english,"Much better than previous titles. Better graphically, ai can be an actual  challenge on higher difficulty. I love that siege battles arent the disaster they used to be. New gameplay mechanics like hordes and razing settlements add interesting options. Managing your internal politics and seeing to your empires needs makes for a real challenge. Dealing with rival politicians as well as foreign diplomacy makes for so many levels of challenge. Balancing your settlements buildings between making food, money or units force you to make tough choices. Now deal with all of that on top of waging war, you got some real headaches. I really felt like a ruler of an empire for the time I played. Gotta admit this title has hooked me in.

 I can see why it got negative reviews though besides people dislike of the dlc model, it just plays differently than other tw titles. You really have to pace yourself, if you try to expand too quickly things will get out of hand at home really fast. Because of this pacing I think some guys just wont like this at all. Blitzkrieging your enemies just won't work as it has in the past at least in my experience. I love the change however. 

I played a campaign as one of the desert empires and trying to chip away at the western Roman Empire was a real challenge. I took a couple of settlements and they really came back at me with a vengeance sending some pretty impressive forces until we both could no longer suffer the losses leaving us both weaker, me more than them however. I gotta hand it to the devs they did a really great job IMHO. Do yourself a favor though and start the campaigns on hard or higher if your up for a challenge.

19,24140662,english,"I've played enough of this game to have experienced the core game mechanics that players repeat every time they play, so I have not gotten far into the campaign events. However, I've experienced most of what the core gameplay is all about.

I played as the 3rd most powerful faction in the game, the Sassanid Empire, and quickly became the 1st when the Roman Empires fell apart, so I had a relatively easy time. As a total war noob, though, I lost most of my first battles to the White Huns and others. The battles are great, and the way you plan out a battle and then carry it out and adapt as the situation changes is a lot of fun. You have to act fast and re=strategize quickly. Battles are the best part about the game.

But unfortunately, they're about 5% of the time you play, if even that. Most of your time is spent on the turn-based campaign map running your faction, which can be very uneventful and boring. The Faction Politics and balancing your control of the faction is very boring and nonsenseical gameplay. Why does my Influence diminish when I get do an action that benefits me? Why is Influence a currency to be spent? 

Managing cities is another aspect of the 90%. But it has an annoying 'population' number that limits new buildings you can build. Some buildings also contribute to negative effects, like public disorder, which is dumb. I hate trying to balance public order, because too often I've wanted to move my armies towards the front lines of whatever war I engaged in but they're having to keep the peace so I don't get a rebellion on my hands. 

Campaign map A.I. can also be puzzling. Often times factions that are pretty far away and I haven't even seen on the campaign map yet will declare war on me for whatever reason, march into my puppet states, but then make peace as soon as my armies arrive to defeat them. And this is usually when my armies are about the same size and number as their's. 

Lastly, agents are the worst aspect of the game. Enemy agents can disrupt your armies and you can't do anything unless you have a counter agent that is hard to unlock. And once you have agents, sending them to disrupt enemy armies and cities feels more like a chore than a fun mechanic. 

If this game and Crusader Kings 2 merged, it would be perfect. We would have the great battles of Total War along with the deep political intrigue of Crusader Kings 2. But since most of Total War: Attila is spent in this watered down version of Crusader Kings 2, I give it a 6/10.

CA knows the army cap doesn't work so they've buffed the free settlement garrisons so early game you can hold off a lot of early game armies. By late game you can hold off large forces without needing an army. Sort of makes limited forces moot.

Huns are just annoying, they get free stacks so you end up playing whack-a-mole with them and it's just not fun. There's no skill or tactics in it, just encourages you to rush for Attila and kill him. I've just wiped out 7 Hun full stacks and wounded Attila. Within 10 turns there's 8 full stacks.

Unit varriation is rather limited, you don't unlock new units but replace old ones, you have ot use mercs for varriation and most of them don't really keep too well in the long run.

Settlements, a few bugged with missing building slots CA never fixed even after claiming it's a bug, food system is broken where you can have 3000 surplus food in the empire but yet a province that has -5 food will have unrest from it.

At first, I wasn't impressed. At near minimal graphics quality, it still wasn't smooth on my laptop (granted my laptop isn't very powerful) Poorly optimized, quite bad fps and clunky UI. I went for a steam refund.

Next day, steam hasn't refunded me the game, and I thought I'd give it another shot. This time, lowering graphics to the most minimum. I slowly got and understood the mechanics of the battles and slowly improved my understanding of the game. It is still a very difficult game, having won my first offensive swipe but lost my first siege defense. Despite that, I felt that there is depth in this game and am currently enjoying it. While I'm playing on pretty poor graphics, I'm enjoying what this game has to offer. 

One thing I am struggling with is the politics, family tree and all that kind of stuff. To me, these are really complicated and I have to search online for tutorials on how these work.

These improvements cannot be overstated, they really make the game come alive and challenge you.

78,23770381,english,"I recently bought this (June 2016). I was initially hesitant because I read tons of reviews saying the game ran poorly or not at all. I have had absolutely no performance or crashing issues whatsoever. The game runs fantastically on my GTX 980ti based desktop and yet still runs respectably well on my 960m laptop too. No complaints in that department. I love just about everything Roman and this is an intriguing game. The battles are fun and the way the campaign gives you so many options is cool. This kind of has that civilization just one more turn aspect.

Ok on to the stuff I don't like. I have only played the Western Roman Empire so my review will be through that lense. It is the hardest of the choices so you can have an easier time playing as another nation.

1. Public Order: You have to watch your territories like a hawk for potential revolts. If your territory spawns rebels they will instantly attack your settlements during the turn change so you will not have time to move your army into position. The rebels will overwhelm the crappy garrisons that the game gives you and take your city. Then insantly after they take the city they are awarded with a full stack of proffesional troops. So when you go back to take your city you are in for a fight. So much hassle and so stupid. Rebels should not be able to instantly have siege weapons and take cities before you have a real chance of defence.
2. Diplomacy: If you play as a large empire get ready for every other faction in the world to declare war on you almost simultaneosly. Due to the diplomatic penatly for being and empire it's almost impossible to keep aliances and peace going for any amount of time.
3. Family Tree: They tried to implement some kind of game aspect where you have a line of succession and you have to try to stop other families from gaining control of the government or starting a civil war. While this is a pretty historical truth to the Roman empire it's really not enjoyable for me. Keeping track of characters loyalty and marriages and related is not what I'm here for. I wish there was a way to just disable this piece. I think keeping your people happy to stop rebellions and seperatists is sufficient for historical fun.
4. Amphibious attacks: Barbarian nations and hordes can sail across the known world and attack your undefended back provinces. This is rediculous. The horde concept where they can travel through your territory is sufficient enough but I've had the barbarians from Ireland set sail and land in Italy. It would be almost impossible for that kind of population to even cross the channel and attack Gaul.
5. Walls: The large cities in the Empire have shit for walls now. They are really just ramp walls that are practically useless and ugly to look at. Most of the main cities in the empire should still have the stone walls from when the empire was at it's peak. I think this was done for ease of programming and pathfinding but it takes some of the fun out of siege battles. Also related is if a city is under siege the internal buildings get damaged even if the attack never happens and the army leaves. WTF? Then you have to pay for repairs.
6. City size, roads, ect: Almost all of your cities and roads start out at level 1 or totally undeveloped. How after 1,000 years of empire do I not have some infrastructure to start out with?
7. Non stop attacks: Due to the way the AI gets a high base income, barbarians with 1 city can pump out armies at about the rate a medium sized empire can

Here is a list of mods from the workshop I recommend to deal with the above issues and make the game much more fun.

7 Point Corruption - Stops you from getting to the 95% corruption level if your empire gets too big. (Really 95%? wtf?)

Barricades 3x Stronger - The siege barricades by default can be taken out in like 3 seconds

Base Income 2000 - Makes 1 city foes behave more like 1 city foes militarily speaking

Buffed Edicts - The default edicts really aren't that great

Buildings Reduce Corruption - Makes government buildings reduce corruption. Seems logical

Climate Tweaks - Without this the end game will be bulding farms everwhere. The climate change negatives never return to normal by default

Improved Gold Mines - Makes gold mines more lucrative. Maybe a little OP but don't you think gold mines should make decent money?

More Bold Campaign Borders - You can't see the borders when fully zoomed out by default without this

No barbarian artillery - Stops the Huns, ect. from being able to take cities like Constantinople with artillery. Which is historically accurate

No Great Power/No Imperium Penalty - Stops the huge diplomatic penatly you get for being a large peaceful empire

Pikes Ready In Your Hands - By default pikemans pikes will dissapear when not in formation. This addresses that

Stronger Romans - Increases the power of east and west empires by reducing unhappiness, increasing food and garrisons. You definitely want this if you don't play Romans or the West will fall too quickly. If you do play Romans it's nice that you can count on garrisons to do anything at all.

Transports Only Through Ports - Tries to stop barbarian hordes from going amphibious

The above mods will make the campaign much easier for the Romans so if you want an extremely hard game they aren't recommended.

Also it still has the historically-ridiculous and strategy-destroying province system that means you can't individually tailor any of your settlements for specific functions (eg as a fortification etc), but obviously some high up manager at CA came up with that little gem so its never going to go away now.

Alright so this is the successor of Rome 2. The next TW Title right after Rome 2. The next big thing after Rome 2.
I think it has delivered everything it was supposed to. ( I know many people disagree ) But its the small things that make this TW Title interesting. For instance, Political System Overhaul, Family Tree UI is back!, New Horde Gameplay Mechanics, Beautiful Graphics Improvement, and the platform for a dark and dying world where the Roman Empire is divided ready to be ravaged by foes from all sides. Great setting I say. However there are some issues I found that were a bit annoying, like Tier 1 and Tier 2 Units have low morale, like really low, one charge from the rear by a ShockCav and it would send them wavering like crazy. Also the campaign map difficulty has been revamped to be so hard, like Food requirements and PublicOrder are a chore to maintain, which is a good thing because nobody wants to steamroll everywhere. But for players who start out with Attila may find a long learning curve in front of them especially when it comes to Campaign Map Gameplay. But its all for the greater good anyway, and that is to create a new experience in the world of TW:ATTILA. So the factions are quite rich in setting and cultures do have interesting traits to start out with. DLCs are okay as well, I would like to commend the DLC AoC, nothing but fun there. It is also tooltip paradise for people wanting to get info on this and that. Oh and btw, the mod support for this game is stunning! Gives the game so much hours to play with. Mods like Medieval Kingdoms 1212 AD or Divine Roman Empire Mod are excellent examples. Ultimately its a solid addition again to the franchise. Good AI (on Very Hard Settings), Excellent ModSupport, Diverse Campaign Sessions, Beautiful Graphics and freaking Vikings! What else can I say :)

7,23360243,english,"Been playing Total War since Rome 1 for reference.

This game is a return to form for the Total War franchise. After Rome 2 this game feels like everything that Rome should have been.

Visually the game has imorived by adding a fire mechanic and a siege escalation that brings some life to the cities and sieges. Watching building burn and fire spreading thru ought the city is deffinitely something to see, its that extra immersion you really appreciate.
On a game play side, the AI is performing much better than before, tho not perfect, the politics system has more depth to it that Rome 2, but still not to the level we wanted. The return of the family tree is much appreciated.
The food system has been drastically overhauled definitely adding a lot more strategy to province management, specialization of provences isn't easy like in Rome 2 and definitely equires a bit of planning.
Another small but useful change is making all the provinces have three regions.

In my campaign on Very Hard as Himyar I found it challening to expand into Egypt and squaring off against the Eastern Romans,  many battles had to be fought before I could get a single settlement and the AI moved its armies in strategic ways that actually withheld me frrom going forward, something that impressed me.
Public order isnt that easy to manage either, before I could go on my conquering rampage maintaining region control was important, while defending the same territory from the AI armies.
Playing in Europe is like racing against the clock in preperation for the Huns and if you can't stop em, then you better move, a sense of tension that is really engaging.

Agents are still very important but not as OP as in ROME 2, Spies definitely got nerfed and you won't see alot of poisining going on which I am ok with.

All in all the game requires more strategic thought than before wether you play as a nomadic tribe or not and that is something I appreciate.

There are still somethings that could have been done better and more features could have been added, diplomacy is still the same as before and I would really like the re-introduction of region trades but its probably not happening, AI is good but nor perfect but overall the positives far outweigh the negatives.

So if you wanted to play strategically; for instance, pairing one nation against the other and watch them destroy each other, you can't. Nor is there any other clever ways of playing. The only way to play is to directly attack your enemies in which your allies will do nothing or little to help. As far as the multiplayer goes theres is very little strategy. It's basically whoever has the most units wins; which causes for some pretty frustrating gameplay. I've tried playing vs strategically, looking up guides and tips yet I still get crushed. Maybe i just suck but i have never been this bad at any of the other Total Wars. It does look nice and runs pretty well but for me it just lacks dimension. It just falls flat compared to the older Total Wars.

The problem with higher difficulties is something that CA has struggled with. The AI does not strategize or perform better. Rather, higher difficulties just enable it to mass-produce large armies of cheap and worthless units, then relentless toss them at a single settlement of yours. Let me highlight that last part: relentlessly attacking one particular settlement of yours. During a war, your AI enemy becomes absolutely fixated on one single city that you own. It doesn't matter if they've lost three, four, or five whole armies at this one city; they will come back. In terms of gameplay, this is depressingly repetitive.

There are a few problems with the A.I, specifically thinking you will lose almost any autoresolve situation. There are also a couple glitches in the real-time battles, but those are very few and inbetween. 

I might be biased, I've been a fan of Total War since the age of 12; all in all, this game is great. Has a beautifully rendered map, and small things like the return of the family tree (fans will know) add more depth with the tiny details. This is a game where it is normal to feel hopelessly out-numbered most of the time, to have your settlements and regions burned to the ground, and make the most unusual of alliances which could span across the known world. 

This is a game that will challenge you and make you want to flip a table. It will feel like you are beaten down all the time and are struggling to survive in every situation. 

But I promise you, you will never feel a great sense of accomplishment once you win a campaign than you will with this game.

The thing that annoyed me the most was I had to unisntall steam and loose everything just to play it, Basically I got the game around Christmas time and it worked, I stopped playing total war untill the other day, And Attilla would not load at all, It wouldn't even go to the launcher, So I tried deleting the game and re-installing, That didn't work, I guessed steam was having problems... So I took it to the extreme and deleted steam and everything in it loosing all my game saves and everything. The game finally worked.. So if you have that problem that is the only way I know how to save it (I tried things given by support none of them worked)...

But on the Bright side I can now play as Saxons and demolish Frank pre-frog scum.... :D

I loved Attila, still playing my western roman empire campaign(I did mod the look of some late game units to make them more uniformed looking like legio comitatenses for example, their eastern counterpart seemed to be well equipped, my empire was strong, so I thought it would only make sense instead of looking like they were scrapping for helmets).


I like the grittiness, the winters felt like a real danger, I found myself having to constantly rethink my strategy everytime my armies got caught by surprise by the winter and forced me to set up camp(sometimes I didn't pay attention to the seaons lol) and under those conditions sometimes I had I engaged and pursued hunic hordes every time they showed up with doom stacks(had ot retreat and regroup legions spread across the western/northern front every time that happened).


That 'scare everyone' trait that many hunic units have was  a bitch to deal with, I lost some battles(first time that happens without getting outnumbered in a TW game for me lol). 


Legio IV Ionia engaged a splinter Hunic force to prevent them from engaging the other legions the next turn foreseeing how depleted they will be and vulnerable to attack, they valiantly did their duty, and after that battle, Legio 1 Roma Victrix led by the emperor, Legio 2 Emperor's Fist led by the heir, and Legio VI(or V forgot what I named it) Herculia, along with Legio VIII Augusta with some scholae palatine as pursuer/support army...they all engaged and met 6 Hunic armies that were all together in one group, some camping to replenish from attrition from the winter(I myself got one of my legions hit by that slightly, and Legio 2 hadn't fully replenished from a previous battle due to hunic presence in the region and the winter that prevented them from ever replenishing entirely) But it lead to HUGE major battle:


Had like 5ksomething(WRE) vs 6k something battle against the Huns in open plains battlefield, with some forests to the side and far back. I was against the battle map's borders, double lines of everything you can think of, elite palatina, herculiae seniores, mostly legio comitatenses, ballistarie, onagers, shock and melee cavalry, the emperor dismounting to fight like a badass in the front line before I was forced to call back since I needed the extra mobility(was about to get flanked and all my other cavalry was already engaged in a hell of a cav. vs cav. fight).....and as I withdrew units that had taken too many losses, new ones from the other legions that don't show up in the battle you know, just as reinforcements, kept on pouring in from the left and right,fresh units to rush to form up the lines, reinforce the thinner lines that had seen too many engagements, hold off archer fire, jump in to the fight when needed, charge when needed, retreat when needed, retreat when I didn't need them to(they routed lol)....was playing with control large armies ticked to have 40unit cards at once and it was just.........boy did it get intense, at first it all seemed under control, but when the reinforcing armies of the huns and attila himself showed up coincidentally, it got hairy.....God DAMN! that was a battle, explosions everywhere(they also had their own onagers, it was the famous Huns doom stack armies that spawn from time to time so), arrows flying in every direction, so much fighting and cavalry charges and death......Luck would have it, that Legio Herculia's shock cavalry finally enters the battle from my right, some of the cavalry from Augusta had joined recently too from the left, a little worn out but still strong, I regroup what I have from the left, I placed the emperor center line to keep morale steady, all elite Palatina are engaged(and trust me, ti was a like a thousand of those swordsmen or more still around), I reinforce the Legio, some are sent into the attack, ballistari are pulled back a little to be able to shoot better, and I grab all my cavalry and I sent them from the right and left flank simultaneously to envelope and engage the hunic cavalry(came a little from behind, went all the way around so, they had no where to go) and from there, some of them managed to get through and engage from behind the enemy infantry that was fighting my infantry. After that, that's it, I saw units breaking from my side, I saw units breaking from theirs, I saw a lot of units shaken due to the cluster fuck of 'scare everyone' traits from so many elite hunic units.....but they kept it together, and they won, Attila escaped...but Augusta took pursuit and managed to kill him off once and for all, shame it didn't get to be the Emperor himself, but he's already done this part by leading the Empire into such a great battle and close victory.

There're a lot of mods curretly out to cater the game to your experience, and the DLC, while massively overboard, DOES have a few gems in it ( AOC, Cultures of the sand ) and might be worth considering if you liked it.

IN DEPTH:
POSITIVES:
+ Battles are super fun to play and for the most part, responisve. Units tend to not bug out as often at least.
+ Historical Battles are nice as well.
+ Lots of regions to play with overall
+ Brought back a lot of good things froom Medi2 ( Family tree.. ISH. Though politics are a bit iffy if you're not versed with it )
+ Religion has bonuses, and changes some dialogue lines which is a positive thing ( FOR THE SAVER => FOR THE GODS )
+ Horde system is entertaining
+ Decent enough battle-ai that newer players will have a run for thier money

NEGATIVE
- A lot of the factions are merely copy-paste, with a few unique unit differences.
- Brought back a lot of what I disliked in Rome 2: The Region system, as well 
- To compensate for the average battle-ai, higher difficulties buff the enemy stats tremendously, to the point a tier 1 unit can easily trounce a tier 2 on Legendary consistently
- Campaign AI is dumb. They'll spend turns sacking your cities, just waiting for it to rebel instead of actually conquering it.
- HUNS. While it IS about Atilla the Hun and his rampage, it's ridiculous how that somehow entitles him to respawning stacks. It's a very game-y mechanic to force you to confront him; While it IS fun the first time, it gets progressively worse later on as enemies start to spam high tier units for practically no cost in order to match up to your empire.
- Did I mention Legendary Difficulty missile infantry? Screw them.
- UPGRADE SYSTEM: After researching technologies, it is no longer possible to use cheaper units. For marginally better units, you have to pay a higher upkeep cost, meaning a lot of the researching you'll do is economy first, then military later in order to keep up. Upgrading too early will put you in the negatives and bankrupt you.
- DIPLOMACY: The AI just plain hates you. For no apparent reason. Getting trade? Good luck. Getting non-aggression packs? See them break it a turn later, or worse, run up to your regions and raid it. Can't even fight them off without getting a penalty. ( There's also a really cheap diplomacy abuse you can exploit overall. )

NEUTRAL
= Exploitable AI ( But all Total War has it )
= Maps during sieges vary from fun to play, to excrutiatingly annoying to defend. 
= Cavalry is DOMINANT. Impossible to win battles are made easy as hell due to Cavalry Impact damage, where a melee cav can literally obliterate a moving infantry unit then match the survivors in melee
= Polished, but feels like what Rome 2 should've been on release.
= Reuses a LOT of voices from Rome 2, barring the units spitting out their names.

My main 3 complaints are: Shitty ai. This is compensated for, in the case of the huns, by giving them many many death stacks of vastly powerful units right next to your cities. They become near impossible to stop, without greatly superior numbers. They're just OP.

Fertility. It's bullshit, the climate change mechanic is cool and all but it's so much stronger than it needs to be. I suggest fixing with mods. It's quite vital. (Especially if you're a desert empire: food becomes impossible to get.)

It reintroduces immerison, and is a solid all around improvement.

The only complaint I have of Attila is the way the huns were treated. In a game named after the most Famous Hunnic leader, it's rather dissapointing that you can not actually carve out a Hunnic Empire(without mods).

Additionally, the Raze meachanic, coupled with the doomstack spawning of the Huns, makes this ""Survival Strategy"" game feel rather corny(which is an unfortunate trend with Total War these days). The End of Days theme is too overplayed, and to the detriment of gameplay.

Luckily, as I said, a plethora of mods can deal with these issues. Which makes the game, for me, a solid buy.

Eventhough this game is a unfinished game ( as yo have to buy lots of DLC's), it has given me the pleasure of playng it. 
Firstly the map is great, awsome graphics make the ancient world seem alive and that it changes atmosphiere according to what happens around you; an example of this is when something bad happens, it creates a deep and dark atmoshpiere. Detailed cities and landscape ( same style with rome 2 and shogen 2) makes playcing your armies and controlling your economy even more fun to do as it gives another side to the total war series. 
I have read reviews of bugs that do occur and the way the movement mechanism is not as good in rome 1, however I have found a solutuin by getting mods from the steam workshop that improve the way your units move.
This is awsome, however creative Assembly should of dealth with this before they reliesed this game and as the game wasn't fully optimized, it made people feel betrayed by what the total war series was going to become, like with rome 2.
Battles do have better graphics, amazing looks that not every game has does have an atmospheric feel to when you are actually controling your units. But again CA has not though about fixing the issues that came with rome 2, units when colliding with the enemy, looks as if they hit a brick wall, not good at all. I have countered this with a couple of mods from other players from the workshop. 
I do love this game but would really like creative assembly to fix thier mistakes by updating the lack of optimizing on the game and all the bugs and glitches you have unintentially put on the game ( which you did not bother to get rid of).
Without the mods I have, I proberly would of put a worse review than this one.
Others may suffer other bugs than I do, all in whcih CA need to take into account.
One other note is that the politics side of the campaing is a nice and beutiful touch as other total war games were missing that political touch - you feel more in control now :D
Attila's DLC's don't give you much extra for the price they are asking, (£5.99 for 3 factions to play for example  and £1 something for adding blood gore effects) this all should be included in the game.
Overall this game without all the DLC's and mods isn't a finished game but it is still fun to play and probaly better than rome 2 ( with mods and DLC's that is) :D

97,22804074,english,"Total War:  Attila is the latest installment in Creative Assembly's long line of historical Total War games, and it is a true gem.  With all new mechanics, a larger campaign map, and a new time period, Attila picks up right where Rome 2 left off.  If there was one thing to complain about, it's that Rome 2 should have been this all along, or that Attila really feels more like a very large standalone expansion to Rome 2.  Anyway, on to the good!

The game picks up at 395 A.D.  Rome has been divided into the Eastern Roman Empire and the Western Roman Empire, respectively, and the Huns have begun their slow migration west.  Throughout the entire campaign there is this shadow of the impending apocalypse, with events popping up tying themselves to Attila's birth and adulthood.  The mood is fantastic.  It really works to set a tone that the people of this time period really thought the world was beginning to end, and it does so incredibly well.  New mechanics even tie into this, like settlement destruction.  When besieging or being beseiged, buildings can take damage, even catch on fire that will spread throughout the city.  The effect is awesome, it makes sieges play so much better, and it looks incredible.  Provinces now have fertility ratings that effect how much food is produced, with settlements that have previously been razed offering lower levels of fertility, making it that much more important for you to protect what's your's.

Speaking of which, razing is another new mechanic brought into the fold.  Settlements can now be burnt to the ground, either by the controller or by the attacker.  This mechanic is great.  Horde armies will typically burn your cities to the ground, depriving you of their resources and weakening your burgeoning empire.  They can be resettled at exhorbant costs, though they will not be nearly as fertile as they once were.  Hordes are yet another new mechanic.  Many factions have the ability to just pick up their armies and turn them into mobile cities, allowing for them to move around the campaign map to where they are best suited.  This is another well done mechanic, allowing for factions like the Huns to really hit you by surprise when they want to because you can't always accurately know where they are concentrated.

Religious choice is something else that Attila brings to the table.  Now your faction has a spot in the UI detailing what percentage of your people are what religion.  Should a religion grow enough within your faction, you can actually change it to become your faction's new state religion, with each religion offering their own set of positives and negatives (watch out Christians, you will take serious negative modifiers when facing the Huns).  The family tree is also back, and it is surely welcome.  Tied in with it are new governmental offices of which you can place members of your family and statesmen into for different bonuses, but you have to watch out for the balance of power within your faction.  While complicated, it is much easier to grasp than Rome 2's political system and actually has effects on what's going on, rather than seeming like nothing more than a waste of time.

Speaking of Rome 2, many of that game's mechanics have been refined in Attila.  Stances now do as advertised, units actually follow orders that are given to them, and shield walls now actually protect the unit from missile damage taken from the front and left where the shield is held.  Units still blob up when attacking, but it isn't as bad as it was in Rome 2.  However, units still break formation whenever ordered to attack, requiring the player to do silly things such as tell the unit to walk through the enemy.

The factions also offer a wide variety of diversity not just in their units, but also how they play.  Play as the Saxons or the Franks and you're in for your typical Total War experience, start with a settlement and expand.  Play as the Visigoths or the Huns and you're now a horde army, settlements mean little to you when each army is it's own contained settlement.  Play as either Roman empire and right at the get go almost half of the map is your's, but watch as it falls from a poor economy, pissed off and starving citizens, and multiple attacks from almost every other faction and you're just trying to survive.  Not to mention that the Hunnic hordes are gathering in the east...With their sights set on Rome.

Now I know that I've given this game plenty of praise compared to my Rome 2 review, but that is because this is a well polished jewel of a title...However, there's always bad.  The biggest complaint that I have about this game is that it is everything Rome 2 should have been.  Had CA put the time and attention to detail into Rome 2 that they did Attila then there would have been no need for this game to come out.  And really when playing it it just feels like a really big expansion to Rome 2.

Now, it would be unfair to judge Attila based on what Rome 2 didn't do right, so my biggest complaint is the freaking pay wall that CA put up on half(!) of the factions.  Within weeks of this game releasing there were numerous DLC faction packs that came out, prompting one to ask why CA had to release them as paid-for DLC when they were most likely finished along with the main title?  Now, I'm not against DLC, I understand that it is a necessary evil in today's gaming world, but to have half of your available factions as DLC is more than a little extreme.  At least it's not as bad as Rome 2, which had just as many faction packs as well as additional unit packs for sale.

When all is said and done, Attila stands alone as a fantastic example of what a Total War game could be if given the proper amount of love, devotion, and attention that CA has seen fit to provide it with.  Though it is a lesser known time period (the dark ages, afterall) than their other games, mechanically it is by far the best Total War to date.  I highly recommend this game to anyone who is even slightly interested in the Total War series, and I believe that if you can get past the dark ages time period, you will fall in love with this game as I have.

To be honest I can't really not recommend buying this game to someone who is interested.

But then again, if you are looking to get into Total War games for the first time. Ditch this. Pickup Shogun 2 probably first IMO, then pickup Rome 2 if you liked that a lot. Medieval 2 was the best of the franchise but it is old and aged now. If you can get past the graphics, pick that up for sure.

Pros
•	Fun nations (I love being Celtic/Nordic nations)
•	Interesting siege options
•	Rebellions cause new nations which causes new diplomatic needs
•	Better customization generals. This time they gain abilities/experience.
•	Army units also gain abilities as they gain experience in battle.
•	Ability to remove a city off the map entirely. Adds flexibility/difficulty to strategies 

Cons
•	Nothing that changed from the newest Rome Total War. (i.e. should have been an expansion)
•	They will bleed you for DLCs to get extra nations/campaigns/blood (yeah blood)
•	Same army limitations (i.e. need generals, very limited on generals)
•	Numerous sound glitches when zoomed in on heavy combat
•	Numerous graphic glitches especially in the snow. 
•	Tedious achievements
•	Food system is strange. Your nation has food surpluses but a province don’t have access to it? Each province basically needs its own food supply. Significant food sources causes disease.

And, when on sale.

The good:
-actual defensive positions in town and minor settlements
-higher ground in towns and settlements actually helps in defending a static line
-Cavalry actually do shock damage
-Archers actually have decent range
-Morale/combat mechanics are better joined (sending in archers with knives after their arrows are gone can actually stabilize a defensive line for a spell)
-Archers can finally fire up and over buildings onto units rather than needing a direct line of sight
-Mercenaries seem cheaper than in Rome II (except for some higher end units, like Onagers) 
-When attacking towns, double right clicking on it will cause selected units to automatically find the fastest way around buildings (which the player is shown right away, which means you have the option of changing said orders if you don’t like the path they have been set on around corners, etc)
-Enough gold (10-20000 pieces) can sway a faction to join a war with you, even if they don’t like you. This includes the Huns.
-Players will be forced into diplomacy (i.e., joining in wars and making friends/allies that way), subjugation does not really work in the long run (except for the AI, of course)
-Governors are quite useful, and gain levels and abilities as they go along (just like the generals)
-Upgrades for armies and Governors are tree based now, so you can plan ahead finally (unlike Rome II’s system)
-Playing as Rome is terrifying and exciting, and many players will pull all 10 armies back to Italy (and perhaps spain) in order to ride out the storm. All of Gaul, Britannia, and Africa go up in flames through rebellion, famine, settlement destruction, separatist movements, and separatist movements to the separatist movements. One may eventually see Romanesque factions eventually, that call themselves “Africa”, “Asia”, and even “Egypt” or “Illyria.” Pulling through that storm (usually about 30-50 turns), takes a long time, but is immensely satisfying. One may even find himself making trade agreements and alliances with Roman factions that split from old areas you lost 100 turns before to rebellion.
--The Huns burn everything to the ground. Again and again, and have some terrifying units to play with. Join in a few wars with them and you may win their favor…
--Incredible graphics on high end machines




Problems; The old, the new, and the frustrating:
[EDIT: some of these can be fixed with mods]

-Military alliances are great for maintaining a good relationship with factions you are trading with, but worthless when someone actually declares war on YOU. If you call your allies in to join you in war, 90% will say “No. ♥♥♥♥ you”, and your alliances are all severed. This means you will have to either reload, or spend 10-20000 gold trying to reestablish military alliances you had previously had with them in order to keep them from breaking trade agreements, and eventually coming after you. This means that whenever someone declares war on you, you are alone, regardless. 
-Satrapy states are free to rebel against you the second someone else declares war on you. This means subjugating a faction (when taking their last settlement) is all but pointless if they can rebel the next turn when some ♥♥♥♥-ant faction comes after you. 
-Diplomacy only happens through grotesque amounts of gold and/or with the maxim “Let me join in this war alongside the faction I want to like me, and yes he likes me more eventually, then make a trade agreement, then make an alliance. ” While it can be fun, it gets old fast as it becomes clear that this is the only way to make allies.
-Food surplus means nothing, other than that food is getting to your armies and minor “growth” modifiers around your empire.
-Food is province based now, and by turn 100 all hell breaks loose with food shortage modifiers hardcoded to the game (apparently their take on history…). This means you really have to build a wheat farm and a cattle farm in all your minor settlements, and both Fish ports and food emporiums in your major cities to counteract the worldwide “shortage” of food. Even as Rome, soon you have a 2000 surplus of food even in winter, but sure as heck certain regions without such buildings are not getting any of it. This leaves very few spots for trade based/economy based buildings in all settlements, which is a shame because it leaves little room for open ended city building.
-Sanitation is cool, but it can get out of hand: destroying entire armies if stationed in the affected city. This means another spot of your city is used up with the aqueduct. 
-Another location in your major cities will be used up by building coliseums and theaters trying to keep the people from rebelling, when playing as Rome.
-Immigration becomes a problem, and eventually goes to about a -9 modifier for all regions. Some have said upping the tax rate gets the immigrants to leave, but I haven’t seen that work.
-When playing as Western Rome, all the hardcoded events/modifiers that decrease public order (at worst, -20 for food, -9 for immigrants, and so on) means that little can be done but build food based buildings and hope your religion can pull you through. That wouldn’t be bad, if it were possible to convert to Paganism easily (and let your theaters and coliseums do the work). This means the game pushes you to try and be Christian.
-War is sometimes declared in very odd ways. 3 factions in the British Isles and Ireland were my trade partners, as Rome, and I was on good terms with them. One minor settlement faction suddenly declared war on me while it was being sieged by the other two. Immediately after that, the siegers (two other factions I was trading with) themselves declared war on me as well. And yet they continued to siege the original minor faction to declare war on me, and destroyed it. All this despite the fact that I was trading with all three of them. Very, very odd.
-Second tier units now take 2 turns to muster (which can be crippling, if an enemy is bearing down on you), and said units are barely better than the 1st tier and so on.
-All units are outdone by the overwhelming power of artillery. The Artillery is now so accurate it can hit cavalry units at full gallop as they bear down on said artillery unit (to try and kill it off). Often they never make it!
-A player may not want to bother researching any military improvements when considering how expensive the units are (and time needed to muster them), and so may only research economy techs to try and make some money. Early game economies are so fragile you are counting down to the last 10 gold pieces sometimes. A total war game perhaps should not be that unforgiving towards being warlike…..
-Christian buildings are immensely expensive, so you won’t be able to afford them (and their public ordering abilities) for a long time, but Rome is Christian, and spreading your religion is paramount, but no, you can’t do it…
-Faction politics, and gaining office for loyal subjects seems interesting at first but eventually becomes frustrating; every event usually means you either lose influence or control, and your power slowly ebbs away. Not that it matters that much…
-Generals eventually rebel against you if they live long enough, and so upgrading them as they gain experience loses its charm since you are constantly thinking “When will I need to kill him?” Getting promotions for them does not seem to work either, in the long run. Creative assembly really needs to play some crusader kings, and learn how to balance their political in-game systems so that players have options, rather than feeling like they are simply a sad witness to history through a lackluster historical simulation of Roman politics (where the general always makes a move for power).",1462016249,1462016249,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False,76561198068498144,34,6,52728,0,8184,1599408515,,

I'm so done with TW being a disappointment and their DLC being a disappointment. It's obnoxious. Then I hear my friend make excuses like ""Oh it wasn't in their budget"". How wasn't a critical part of the game in their budget? Do yourselves a favor, migrate (har har Attila) to Paradox and their grand strategy games.

_________________________________________________________________

I'm a huge fan of Total War. Let me start off by saying, CA is dead wrong in how it approaches DLC, I do not recommend buying this game unless its on sale, I don't even recommended buying all of the DLC unless its on a huge sale, and I think its a horrible way to conduct business. The original TWs, pre-DLC madness, were far fuller games, and when you got expansion packs, even moreso. Rome TW, the original, had an immense amount of diversity that you have to pay significantly more for in most modern TWs.

WITH ALL THAT SAID,

Attila is one of the best recent releases. I initially didn't care for it and thought I had been robbed by CA once again after the Rome TW 2 disappointment and the lackluster AI of Shogun TW2. Yet after it had been patched up, along with some DLC (on sale), it has made up for it. The horde mechanics are great, the diplomatic mechanics are great, and how the interplay works is beautiful. I think that the amount of fertility damage in North Africa due to climate change may be too much, but that lacks compares to how much time I've had enjoying it. I recommend it, only because it was so much better than Rome TW 2, significantly so that I open up the Emperor Edition and go, nah, then open Attila and gleefully resume a 200 turn campaign I've been working on.

I am literally only recommending it on its Merits and that barely pulls it through, cause CA is a damned thief that hasn't done anything significant outside of Attila, and Rome TW 2 was the biggest disappointment.

33,22640446,english,"Let me start by saying that if you have any reservations about this game after an experience with Rome II, abandon them.  This is NOT the same game.  Back when Rome I came out Barbarian Invasion felt sort of like a cheap reskin and cash grab. (At least to me)  In contrast after Rome II, Total War: Attila feels like a last ditch effort at redemption.  That being said, it works.  While still using many of the same basic mechanics, this game manages to feel much smoother and much more rewarding.  Maybe that's just because I can actually see cavalry smash a unit of poorly prepared infantry, versus in Rome II where they would end up locked in this bogged down stalemate that was decided by who had more men with better morale.  In Attila the combat is better, the campaign is smoother (even if the turns still take a long, freaking time for the A.I. to get through) and it all has a more historical feel.  This game didn't attempt to be balanced as far as units goes, and that is a GOOD thing.  People who play this game should be looking at the historical accuracy to units and areas first, with balancing being a secondary issue.  The main balancing issue in Rome II was that it was too balanced in combat and the campaign was economically unbalanced.  This game is the opposite and the result is as rewarding as Rome I.  The large number of A.I. factions, highly detailed campaign map, complex political system, and time triggered events make this game feel immersive and realistic.  That is not to say that the game is without flaws, but unlike in a few other Total War installments, *cough* Empire and Rome II *cough* *cough*, I feel like the downsides are more than canceled out by the positives.  One good example is the sheer number of itty bitty A.I. controlled factions on the map.  Yes, the outrageous amount of time it takes for every, single, one of them to take their turn is incredibly annoying.  But in contrast while playing as the Sassinads I have nearly a dozen of these itty bitty factions acting as puppet states, much like they did in history.  And they pay me tribute, which is really nice.  To sum it all up, this game is worth the money.  I don't know if the DLC is worth it or not, that is a personal choice, but if you like Total War and you're willing to be patient enough to learn how to actually be good at this game, then it can be extremely rewarding.",1461641864,1461641864,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198022403502,193,7,12626,0,3545,1597977973,,

40,22617726,english,"Not having played TW games for a good number of years and starting again with Arena and after that this one, I start my very first game on Hard with the Huns.

A couple of turns later I got 1 of my 3 armies down to the Balkans near Constantinople and face two generals who come at me with full armies at once. Since essentially all my troops are mounted, I advance toward the enemy in full speed. Once I get close, I am able to draw out the enemy cavalry and start kiting them backwards so that they keep chasing me. Once removed from the main body, I quickly surround them with my superior cavalry numbers and route and obliterate them completely.
After that I start advancing toward the main body of legionaries and start adopting a crescent type of formation, splitting their battle line and leaving the general exposed  who now ends in a position at the focal point of the emerging crescent, away from his troops and vulnerable to my cavalry units that quickly manuever around and overwhelm the generals unit. A moment later the generals unit is routing and the general dies before his infantry units are able to come to his aid. The general dead, all those legionaries start routing and all I have to do is chase them down and obliterate their numbers.

Do the same for the other army that comes to reinforce in the same battle.

The entire Eastern Roman main army is destroyed with only minimal casualties on my side. The legendary ""impregnable"" city of Constantinople is now exposed with only 3 units to guard it. That was the end of the most powerful faction in the game.

Rinse and repeat with every other empire I come in contact with, same tactic. Before Atilla even gets born I've destroyed half of the great empires in the world. The AI just feels way to stupid, this game had been out for some time and they still can't make the general understand that he shouldn't remain isolated from the main body of his troops who chase around horses on the map like retarded chickens?

All major battles feel so anti-climactic, conquering Constantinople felt... nothing, trivial. I knew starting on a higher difficulty wouldn't change anything since the flaw is in how the computer makes its decisions in the battlefield and not some issue with balance of strength on soldiers.

Haven't had any incentive to play the game after that, to easy, because the AI has a core critical flaw which is to easy to exploit and the soldiers just go on a mass route immediately after their general gets killed.

Apart from that I could have given this game an 8/10, but now, being an old Rome1 TW fan, feels like I'm playing an old, large, clumsy and stupid game.

People hate CA because they are proven liars, nobody likes liars, they can't be trusted, they'll say literally anything to get your cash because they are greedy lying pigs.

Gamers hate them for Rome 2 and mock them for the paid mod Attila.

They are viewed with so much contempt because they have adopted EA pricing policies, EA was for years the most hated company in the world, and guess what folks? that's right, if you copy behaviour that generates resentment and hatred you recieve resentment and hatred.

They spend more on marketing than they do on development for christs sake, and it works, lol @ the irony, they've succeeded in convincing enough halfwits that breaking a game up into 3 pieces and then breaking those 3 pieces up into even smaller pieces is OK, these poor mutts think that's perfectly acceptable, queuing up slavishly to pay £300 for what once cost £30, parading the mouse icon of preorder shame with genuine heartfelt pride.

CA are loathed by so many gamers because they perfectly represent a distillation of all that's wrong with the gaming industry, just like the mainstream media or politicians, they reek of dishonesty and greed.

It wasn't always this way, CA was loved by everyone who played their games because they loved the games they made. it wasn't about money, it was a labour of love for them and love begets love.

Great game. Could be better... The first Total War game I ever played was Medieval: Total War. At the time, I thought this is great. When Rome: Total War cam out, I was blown away. It was pretty new and pretty different. I didn't really play Medieval 2, but I did play Empire, and it was not good at the initial release. CA kind of released Napoleon to redeem themselves after Empire. Shogun 2 is my personal favorite of ALL the Total war games I have probably clocked around 1500 hours on it, and I was completely enthralled. While it kind of annoyed me that they tried to get at least on unit pack out there, I thought hey this is great. I was so excited when Rome 2 was announced, i could not wait.


MAAAAAAAN was it disappointing it took about 20 patches to get what they should have had from the start, which should not have happened. Total War Attila was kind of like Napoleon, To make up for their disaster with Rome 2. I was also extremely excited for Total War Attila to be released, and I would be somewhat disappointed. Most of the problems were with the campaign. You couldn't go 10 turns into the game without looking at the campaign map and seeing that most of WRE settlements had razed. It looked like someone had dropped nuclear warheads on the Balkans. Not to mention the amount of factions would go into hoard mode, and most of the factions doing this weren't even close to the Hunnic hordes so it wasn't even historically accurate. The slavic factions should be panicking, yet it seems they have the largest growing kingdoms that far east.


Rebellions also occur almost at random, and I cant even go a single turn without fighting a god damn town defense battle, which by the way, almost all look the same. ERE campaign rebellions become awfully repetitive, and while it is to be expected with WRE, if they would add more settlement variety that would be most welcome.

Oh man... and then there are the DLC packs. Oh boy, I could go on for HOURS on why half of these DLC are not at all worth getting, and yet I won't. They did useless DLC spams with Empire, Napoleon, Shogun 2, Rome 2, Attila, AND now probably Warhammer. I laughed for like, 10 minutes when I saw the ""Chaos Warriors"" pack! Making Chaos warriors a DLC faction is like saying your selling lemonade at a lemonade stand, but instead of the drink, you have printed and photocopied pictures of lemonade and then try to sell it to others. Chaos is like, The best thing about any warhammer game, it is ALWAYS in a good warhammer game, the forces of chaos being literally what is trying to destroy the old world, and yet we have to pay 7.99 to play as the one actual constant in warhammer fantasy. Doing this is seriously not the way to get more customers.

The migrating factions show the most diverstiy, while most of the faction DLC (And Yes, I'm looking at you Vikings) have four or five units that differ from eachother.  Buying DLC such as the Empires of Sand or the Celts can help fill in the sparse faction roster, but many of these DLC's feel like copy and pasted factions, while many of them should have been included in the base game.  Having DLC is acceptable, but when it takes away from the diversity of a game, namely taking out the opportunity to play as any of the northern factions (North Britain, Denmark, Scandenavian factions) the base game suffers.

It is now, essentially, an experience that Rome 2 should have been at launch. Its good. I regret spending as much as i did but its worth at least a full $30 dollars in my opinion. You can play as many different factions from the era surrounding the fall of rome, and the beginning of the dark ages, controlling large armies in RTS battles which are punctuated by maintaining your political and economic empire in a turn based map of europe. The Ai is pretty dumb still, but the game has plenty enough artificial difficulty to make it challenging, mostly by making the economic side difficult, keeping you constantly strapped for cash if you are constantly at war. I recommend it but maybe my view is tainted by my love of the franchise.

As an aside, Age of Charlemagne i found to be quite good.

This game is totally revamped. Finding a nice middle spot between Rome 2 and more formation style Napoleon, Attila hits the player with impressive graphics.

As long as your provinces have solid garrisons and/or 10+ unit armies in the immediate area, rebellions are easily overlooked.The entire public order system, however, is much more sensitive. 

Research, while neccessary, does not limit civ growth too much. The obvious attraction in this game is to go for the big factions (Roman, Sassanid, Huns, etc.), but the real fun is as the smaller nations, IMHO. 

On the DLC, I have only done Age of Charlemagne. It plays as a good DLC should, in that in introduces a small ""sub-game"" off the base game, with unique factions and a harder level of play. The other DLCs are only worth if one is absolutly dying to play as a certain faction.

Rome: One word that changed the course of history forever! I love the concept of rewriting history and attempting to survive the 'apocalypse' as Rome, a challange not many have surmounted! However when we look at early descriptions of the game developers really focus on the survival aspect of Attila. But to me its poorly illustrated. Unless you seriously fuck up, the game is just like any other Total War of expanding by war. The only faction that too me truly implements the survival aspect are the migrators and West Rome. I've had an enourmous amount of fun on this game, and over 30 ATTEMPTS at Hunnic Legendary (Atilla FTW). The game as a core has many new features and an all around polished finish, however I feel the initial concept of the game (survival) is still extremly lacking.

71,21878900,english,"I think this game shows the inherit problematic and good things about current total war. First off, this game looks amazing. To think they can put that much detail on individual soldiers and have thousands of them running around is amazing. But, that is where my praise ends. The battles do not even come close to the feeling of medieval 2. For example, one time in medieval 2 i was playing as the english. The enemy, that is to say the french, had their backs to paris. They made a desperate attack before i could lay seige to the city. The enemy army outmatched and outumbered mine. It looked like my momentum would break. Then, they chose to attack my army with cannons in it. That was my secret weapon. On the battlefield, about half the enemy force was peasents, the other half knights, all on foot. As they advanced haphazardly, charging headlong into my english knights, put there because they were strong on the defence, my cannons opened up and routed nearly half the peasents, as they were clumped up in blob tactics. Then it was only a matter of time, as my strong english knights repulsed the enemy. That battle was epic, and the victory heroic. But you dont get that in attila. All of the melee troops are only good for one thing, their more costly versions just upgrades. But in medieval 2, the english knights were geared towards defence, and the feudal offense. In attila, there is not much of strategic unit placement, as everything soon disolves into a blob. Quite frankly, the battles are not exciting anymore. Also, the optimization is crap. My computer can run really high graphics on most anything else, save the witcher 3. But here, it lags like crazy, even though when i turn on my fps counter, it is not that bad. The battle AI and Campaign AI is boring, to say the least. All the enemy does is charge towards the center of you line. It is really predictable. There is no jostleing for position, no priortizing of high ground, just senseless charges. I feel as if this addition to the total war series will not be a forecast for total war warhammer, a game that is part of my favourite series of games, and a setting that is my favorite fantasy setting.

73,21859846,english,"On a Technical and Gameplay level Attila is far better then Rome II, however Attila suffers from having half of it's content locked behind a DLC paywall.

PROS

- Far better Campaign map, family Trees, better internal poltics, Better City Management.
- Harder to Expand out and become an OP Empire due to more external events happening in the game world
- More about Survival and protecting your borders then Dominating and conquering half the map
- Better music and atmosphere from Sound Design.
- Much Better Battle AI and Path Finding both in battle and the Campaign map. Battle AI has actual intellengence!!
- Better Unit Cards and far superior UI
- Various factions that are all visually different from one another and play differently.
- Less Dependant on Mods to be playable vs Rome II which needed a ton of Mods to be fun and stable.
- More Stable, less prome to crashing or glitching out.
- Better combat mechanics related to Moral and fire Arrows.
- Campaign map and Battle maps are intertwined much more effectivly.

CONS 
- UI bugged out on me a few times forcing me to restart game
- AI still has ""Some"" issues i've seen instances were it refuses to move or Clumps together and does nothing at all.
- DLC is over-priced (Wait for a Sale and get the DLCs)
- Needs a Re-release for 60$ physical copy version with all the DLC (AKA Skyrim Legendary Edition) 
- Requires a beefy computer (Though if you Can play Rome II, You'll be fine)
- Lacks good optimization, aka no 64-Bit support (War Hammer Total War will)

Overall, a solid purchase, would recomended it as it's a far better then Rome II by quite a large Margine, it seems they listend to all of the negative feedback from Rome II and made a great game.  Would i buy it? Yeah, i'd pay 50$ for this one, But i wouldn't pay for the DLC at full price. I spent roughly 500 or so hours in Rome II, and towards the end i was getting bored how bad it was.

86,21712664,english,"Total War: Attila is to Rome II what Napoleon Total War was to Empire: it is a more polished, better optimized version of a previous game set in a time period that is close enough in proximity to make the style of warfare (and therefore gameplay) similar, but far enough away to add new mechanics that do not look suspicious or out of place. If Rome II is about building an Empire, Attila is about surviving an onslaught of calamity or causing it, depending on what side of the wall you are on. 

The Good:
The Setting...
Attila is set during a time period of terror and dispair. Themes such as disease, war, famine, loss of hope, and the failings of civilization are ever present. The game is not fair, nor does it pretend to be. I can say honestly without reservation that when you play Attila, you are playing a game where the board is stacked against you and you are always one step behind its devilish designs. Sometimes, the only option is to make the best out of a bad situation and soldier on. Other times, the only option is to start the game over after being systemically dismantled. The game is engaging however, and has a lot more character than previous total war titles with in game cinematics telling the tale of Attilas rise and fall as the scourge of God. This game is about survival first and foremost: conquest or glory takes a back seat. The music is also leaps and bounds better than Rome II and sets the mood.
The Gameplay...
The gameplay both on the campaign map and in battles is quite good. It is arguably what Rome II should have been at launch. Unlike Rome II, I play this game absent any mods and I find the AI is punishing and as devious as ever. Seiges and playing on the defensive has never been so fun in a total war game since Shogun 2. Playing on the offensive is simply not an option for several factions until you are 100 + turns in as your units simply do not have the capabilities (the Romans). For other factions, offence is THE ONLY option. This means that the game has huge replayability: the game will play differently everytime you play as a new faction. With so many factions to choose from, you will be playing this game for a long time. Add in the Age of Charlamagne DLC, and you will be playing even longer. However, as mentioned above, Attila is a game where paranoid strategists will feel right at home because the game is stacked against you. It is not fair, and you will lose...a lot. But like games such as XCOM, sometimes getting pummelled is just part of the fun. You will lose a campaign 150 turns in and still be amazed with how epic it all was. New gameplay mechanics like a family tree, sanitation, hordes, governors, and my personal favourite, the ability to set fire to settlements while in battle are a delight. 
The Grapĥics...
The game looks amazing and is optimized far better than Rome II. Running this on max graphics settings is quite a sight to behold. The new settlement razing mechanic both in the campaign map and in battle look amazing. It feels like you are there, fighting in Rome with the entire city burning around you, and that is pretty sweet. The graphics in this game are what was promised in Rome II at launch...incredible. There is not much else to say on the matter. The game is beautiful. 
The Challenge...
Playing as Western Rome is the most satisfying but brutally hard game of total war I have ever played. And I loved every second of it. 
The Bad:
Preferences...
This game is not a traditional total war game. I personally view this in the games favour as I like the change of direction, but this is something that divided many fans. It is less of a historical what if simulator and more of a historical survival simulator. 
Razing...
By the end of the game almost the entirety of the map will be a pile of burnt tinders. This makes expansion an expensive proposition late game, as it takes on average, 10,000 gold to rebuild a minor settlement. This makes the legendary victories time consuming to achieve more than challenging. You will often get a minor victory and find yourself in a wasteland with no other factions left, and just call it quits rather than mash end turn over and over to save to rebuild. I like the razing mechanic but wish the AI used it a bit less zealously. That said, razing settlement after settlement as Attila is a blast. 
Bar Bar...$$...
Barbarian Factions must spend so much gold to transform roman settlements into their own that it is unreasonable. Again, this acts as a barrier to rapid expansion, and forces you to sit back, turtle, and save money more than I would like.

10,21789464,english,"My review for Total War: ATTILA

Simply said, the game is good. It is a huge improvement over the huge mess that was Total War: Rome II.
Better graphics, less bugs (although there are some) and some fun new mechanics.

I will cover the pros first:

Horde mechanic: this is a great mechanic they made that really fits in this time period. Basically, what it does is that as some barbaric factions (Germanic peoples, the Huns of course ect.) you can litteraly just burn down your settlements and move to a different place. When you do that, your armies become moving cities, ""Hordes"" to be exact. These hordes have a extra army stance, and if you click that one, your army becomes a camp, so it transforms into a settlement, with buildings you can upgrade ect. When you finally found a good spot for your faction, just capture the settlement and occupy it, and your hordes will go back to normal armies. Some factions already start out as hordes (Visigoths, Huns ect.) and the Huns can never settle down, whereas the Romans can never go horde mode, at least ive never tried it :P 

Graphics: The graphics are great, but ATILLA is a monster when it comes to performance. I am lucky enough that i have a good pc, and can run this one on high, but a lot of people will have to turn the graphics down. Why is this on the pros then? Because i personally think the graphics are stunning, from the units to the cities to the campaign map, evrything looks amazing.

Burning cities: A small feature, but a fun one. What it is, is that during a siege battle, the attacker can burn down houses with fire arrows or onagers, and the more the city is destroyed the bigger the morale penalty for the defender. Keep in mind that if you damage a city badly, and then you capture it, that the repair costs will be higher.

Now some cons:

DLC: Over the past years SEGA/CA has been kind of shitty with their DLC practises. Cut content, overpriced DLC or just generally a lot of DLC. This is one thing that doesnt ruin the game immediatly, but still makes you a bit sad when you see that 3-4 factions is 7,50 euros or around 8$ and they already have 5 packs of this stuff. The DLC whoring is just a shitty thing to do, and evry year SEGA/CA is getting worse at it.

Balancing: the game is pretty unbalanced, with that i mean especially cavalry units. The charge bonus they get is pretty ridiculous sometimes and the AI is still not great (its Total War after all). Although it isnt Empire-level stupid (Yayyy :D) Also the fertility of regions (high fertility means more money and food from farms) is wierdly done through the campaign, it just get ridiculously unfertile after some time, and then farming doesnt do anything anymore.

Overall I would say it is a good game, and i would especially advise picking it up when its on sale, you probably wont regret it (exept if you have a bad pc, seriously, dont even think about buying it then). And it has enough new things and a interesting time period to keep you playing for a while.",1457789983,1457789983,True,2,0,0.50281912088394165,0,True,False,False,76561198080514588,225,3,4767,0,1846.0,1554306238,,

15,21776962,english,"The game is not well balanced and lacks the ability for the player to enjoy themselves. Namely the Western Roman Empire is almost unwinnable and do not have the income to fight back the numerous amount of enemies. ( ALL of this on legendary difficulty), most of the time you have 12-15 enemies and lossing territory constantly, you have one of the lowest incomes in the game, you start the game with the entire empire pissed at you. It creates a very frustrating game experience and it is the same on all difficulties really. Meanwhile as you loose territory you enemies multiple in the form of Western Seps, rebels, etc etc. (lost count). I have played 220 hours and come to this very conclusion, you can can not unless you cheat or reset the game to the point where you have perfect game conditions. 

This is by far the worst of the total war series and has done nothing to impress me, if anything has caused me not to support any more creative assembly games. Until proven they can balance a game between challenging/ability to experience the game without frustration. 

To further this, it is still overly frustrating on co-op with a ally helping you. Even if you some how control the public order and deal with all of the roaming tribes then magically gain peace with all the barbarians. You still have to deal Atilla who has to be killed multiple times before he is actually dead. Litterally. Meanwhile he spawns upto if not more than 20 maxed out armies destroying every settlement he comes into contact with.

28,21765479,english," I have enjoyed Attila more than Rome 2, with a refreshing setting that feels different from Rome 2 and greatly varying difficulties and starting options. In particular, the Western Roman Empire offers one of the most challenging and unique campaigns in any Total War game. Siege battles can get very tedious due to the very few different city map types, but field battles are nice and varied. 

Hordes can range from being a minor nuisance, sitting about your land leeching your money to being an existential threat to your empire, that can require you to throw your entire military might at them to try and turn them back, an added level of difficulty and a very tense but enjoyable experience I find. I have yet to actually play a horde nation, as ive mostly played settled tribes and the larger empires, but it looks like a fun and different play experience.

I have always enjoyed the campaign elements of the Total War games and Attila adds some cool new features, one of the biggest ones being the religion mechanics. They are fun to play around with and far more in depth than the original mechanics of Barbarian Invasion, with regional paganism, many different branches of christianity and several eastern religions to choose from -- though you may find yourself being swamped by Latin Christianity. The fertility of regions deteriorates over time and through being pillaged and can heavily influence your agriculture choices -- wheat farms produce a lot of surplus food at the start of the game, but as time goes on you will find their usefulness drop off very quickly.

In the end I succumbed to a Steam Sale and I have been very pleasently surprised. The game is essentially similar to Rome 2 and previous TW games bu the Horde mechanic adds a nice touch and the feeling of pressure as the winters get worse and the Huns approach definately adds to the game. The AI is vastly improved. Still not clever, and nowhere near a human opponent but not bugged like Rome 2 seemed to be.

I hear all the complaints about the DLC but to be honest as long as the game works (Rome 2 did not for a long time) then I accept the marketing decisions that are made around DLC - I just might not buy them.

48,21683689,english,"Total War: ATTILA is a real time/ Turn based strategy game by Creative Assembly, set in the dying days of the Roman Empire. The core game has a number of factions available to play in Campaign, Custom battle and Multi-player battle modes, Each varying quite considerably. Before I explain and review the game, I would like to say that many of the negative reviews regarding the game are not actually reviews, but criticism of the payment model (all the DLC). I completely agree that there is no place in this game for ANY DLC (not including expansions), especialy as the DLC factions are actualy in the game as CPU controlled states. But, I believe that the game should be reviewed not just on the payment model, but on the game itself also, so after just over 100 hours of playing, what do I think?

Accessibility and User Interface(UI): I initialy skipped Rome II, (I Purchased it quite some time after Attila), so the UI was a little tricky to get the hang of initialy. But after learning all I thought necessary from the excelent prologue, I jumped strait into the campaign (as the Franks) and quickly got the hang of things. The building and unit cards are nice and recognisable at a glance, which is a massive improvement on Rome II, and the menus are all easy to find and navigate. The unit info scroll is fantastic also, being very informative and once more easy to read and understand. CA has also done away with unit banners (which previously float above the top of units in battle), in favoure of small squares. This does lessen the asthetics a bit, but makes it easier to command your army and recognise troop types, which are displayed on the square. All in all, this game seems to be more easily accessible to new players than previous titles, such as Medieval II, where I started, and a good encyclopaedia makes it even easier to learn.

Gameplay:
Campaign Map: Campaign mode is the heart and sole of any Total War title, and is the part I invest the most time in by far. It consists of (in Attila's case) A large map of Europe, North Africa and some of the Middle-East, which is divided into provinces, which themselves contain three regions, a capital and two, minor towns/cities. This system makes running your empire a more manageable process than when each city was individual, as options often affect the whole province. You will interact with this map through building and marching armies, improving cities, moving agents and a whole host of other actions that are too numerous to explain in depth. The map looks absolutely stunning, and changes between the seasons, which themselves can affect food production and Army attrition and mechanics like that. The campaign map is played in a turn based system, wich can take a while to get through, largely due to the ridiculous number of factions.

Battles!: It wouldn't be Total War without them, these are real time highly strategic events, that can range from small one-sided skirmishes to epic multi-army Affairs with thousands of men (and women) fighting. It should be noted that battles occur when two enemy armies come into contact with each other in the campaign, or just for fun in custom battles. Pitched land battles and seige battles are by far the most entertaining, and it can take lots of practise and experience to hone your tactics and leadership skills. The naval battles however, are in my opinion a complete miss, and always have been since Empire. I can not work out any way to implement tactics, and they end up being a confused jumble of boats bumping into each other and trying to pull off maneuvers. There are also amphibious battles, which are thankfully very fun also, but come on more rarely. In a battle, your army is divided into units, which you can control using mouse comands. Victory can only be achieved by using your units intelligently, and out-maneuvering your opponent.

Online Multi-Player: This is a bit of a let down, and is plagued with massive amounts of lag, sometimes rendering the game unplayable. Still, if you can get into a reletively lag-free fight, they can be very fun, and difficult (there are some very good players out there).

Graphics, Sound and Performance: This game looks beatiful... if you have a decent PC. I personaly have had no issues with frame rates or performance, but I know many people have, and that is NOT GOOD ENOUGH on the part of CA. A game sould be playable by as wide an audience as possible (within reason), and should not be limmited to 'PC Gamers' or people with only high end PC's. I can usualy run the game on maxed out setting, and if you can it is amazing, but I can't see this running well on a home computer, which is exactly how I started playing Medieval II. The sound is good, the music is okay, as are the voices.

Expansions, DLC and Payment (finaly): I'll start this on a good note, the expansions (there are only two) offer a unique and entertaining way to play the campaign. I have not purchased The Last Roman, but by all acounts it is quite good. I have, however purchased Age of Charlemagne, and I think it is brilliant, launching Attila into a new time period with new factions and units, and would recomend it as a great complement to the core game. The DLC (Downloadable Content) however is different. Frankly, it should not exist, it should be in the core game like it used to be. This game has too high a launch price to justify it. To make matters worse, what do SEGA (I say SEGA as this is their responsibility) do with the next title set to release Warhammer, after being bombarded with coplaints and angry reviews, they anounce that arguably the most important race in the Warhammer universe, Chaos, will be released as a day one DLC! What are they thinking?

Summery: DLC aside, Total War: ATTILA is a blast of a game, and one of the greatest strategy games on the market. If you are interested in Roman/ barbarian history, war, strategy games or just want a game that is fun and packed with hours of content, this game is for you. This is in my opinion one of the strongest Total War Titles released, and is a massive improvement on Rome II.",1457348152,1457348152,True,2,0,0.526153862476348877,0,True,False,False,76561198165344031,101,3,13837,0,5696.0,1598783860,,
49,17126038,english,"Although a very exciting game in the Total War series I can't help but say that it seems Creative Assembly did to much on the micro-management features. Sure it's nice to be able to marry off your family members to create political alliances or strignthen a collapsing friendship, but do I really need to waste time with leaving someone behind to govern a province. If you leave a family member to govern it helps public order but you better be able to keep them happy with a decent size army, but even if you do that they still might say f**k it and rebel against you, Okay so that may not be 100% correct, because there is a complex character atribute system that you would normally only find in a RPG or MMO. Once you over look one detail though s**t goes side ways and rebels start popping up like popcorn in your provinces (oh and good luck on the economy). On the positive side Creative Assembly did give us player what we wanted in this epic RTS. Being able to go indepth with our generals abilities and keep the balance of power stable while we climb a political ladder to destroy our enemies, and rivals. And lets not forget the large scale battles, epic sieges, and it had a succesful launch unlike Rome 2. All in all a poor attempt to try and say that it isn't a re-release of Barbarian Invasion. Still a very good game and I would recomend it to anyone interested in a RTS with a real challenge.

56,21654144,english,"Total war attila, mechanics wise, is a decent game. But at times it can be infuriating watching it all go down. The fact that the huns are limitless is somewhat accurate but that doesnt mean from a player perspective it's enjoyble. And having a king that's pretty much an immortal with an expiration date does not help at all. To top it all the victories are just wrong. Now I get that they're fictitious but I think minor victories should insted be based off historic accuracy. Like the vandals only need 12 territories conquered in africa and that's it. Even for the most basic ones you have to conquer half the mediterranean world or be buddy buddy with other people and get their points toward victory too. And don't even get me started on the 'culture packs' they shovel out on a regular basis. But this game has a few saving graces.

1: Campaign packs-
The Last Roman and Age of Charlemagne are amazing. They are worth the price tag that's been slapped onto them.
2: Modding community-
If you don't want to hand out extra cash to buy the game you really don't have to. Mods like ageless empires, Armenia: Torn Between two worlds, And Imperium Praetoria make it all new and all good. For a bit at least. Combined in tandem with 12 turn per year extenders, Radious, and some more governmental or family based mods that make simple but needed improvements, you'll see that all the things you were at a loss with have been neatly buffed out at no cost at all. And the things the community has done with the campaign pack only further this.

Bottom line is this game is FAR from perfect, but it's entertaining at least. And with a little fan content and maybe one or two dlcs actually worth their price, it only gets better.

58,21653124,english,"This is going to be a much more serious review, than my review of Rome II at any rate. This review is done with most DLC (Not Viking forefathers and Germanic tribe pack, because they add literally nothing)

After the Slavs culture pack was released I decided to do a campaign for the Eastern Romans. I had done one when Atilla was first released and had my arse handed to me by the Sassanids while being simultaneously attacked by the Huns to the North. I started off this new campaign in the hopes that this would be the most balanced playthrough I had done yet.

I started off the campaign with Visigoths raiding around Macedon, one of their hordes became seperated, so I took this attack and attacked them. After defeating the army, the other weakened horde buggered off to the West Romans with a legion hot on their heels, next I had to secure public order. The next 10-15 turns was focused purely on public order management, although in this time I did secure a diplomatic marrige with Armenia, made peace with the Tanukhids and sent them into sassanian territory.

The next big problem arose when my buffer state in Arabia was taken over by the Arabian emergants, I took this chance and added an extra territory to the ERE before the Sassanid client states could take it. My northen client state had war declared on it by Kartli, but after several turns of shit all happening, Kartli wanted to be my client state as well (no complaints from me)

Now came the time I was waiting for, the time when I could declare war on the Sassanids, considering this had been suicide on my previous playthrough I was interested to see how this would go. After several turns of blitzkrieg Sassanid Kebab removal that would have made Guderian himself proud, The diplomatic marrige with Armenia fell through and he entire East declared war on me. I ended up within striking distance of Ctesiphon and the Gulf of Persis in my sights. The siege of Ctesiphon was climactic and super difficult, even without Serbia Strong in the background. With all the garrison and supporting armies, the Sassanids had 3 and a half stacks defending with 4 of my legions attacking, siege mechanics have been massivly improved since Rome II from the initail onslaught on the walls to the last charge of the Sassanids kings royal cataphracts, the entire experience was engaging and fulfilling. After renaming Ctesiphon ""Nova byzantios"" I moved on.

With the new DLCs added to the game, my time was relativly easy. Most of the Sassanids client armies were dealing with Himyar in Arabia while the White huns tied up the Sassanids main armies in the east. Armenia fell to a combined coalition of my legions and my client armies in the north, I reached the Persian gulf 7 turns after the fall of Ctesiphon and all Sassanid land had fallen 10 turns after that. That was the easy part, as 4 armies now appeared out of Arabia. After dealing with them my aims turned into converting persian structures into roman ones, within 30- 35 turns I had complete control over the east. While my attentions were turned east, 2 Hunnic hordes crossed the Danube and raised Marcianopolis to the ground, despite a valiant defence by the garrison. In response to this I had both my Thracian armies chase them into the ruins of my town and had a apocalyptic  battle where one of my armies was surrounded and shot to death by horse archers.

Mounting tensions with the Axumite KANGS in somalia caused war, with no armies to defend Africa I had to disband an army in Persis and raise another mercenary army to deal with the Axumites, I finally defeated them with help from Nobiata, my client state and a redirected fleet from the persian gulf.

 In contrast to my conquests, the Western ""Romans"" tore themselves to pieces as if it was a plaything. The Huns wrought their path of devestation into WRE lands like a Tyranid hive fleet, causing mass starvation and destruction. The Roman succesionist thralls and their Germanic masters warred over the last remaining land that had not been razed. Italy was pillaged and destroyed, Roma itself was razed and never rebuilt, Rome survived (even as a phantom of its previous self) in southern Spain and northern Africa. The Vandals claimed Carthage, the Ostrogoths ruled Sicily and the Suebians inherited nothern Spain, so very true to history. The celtic kingdoms and vikings have made substanial gains in southern France while the other 33% of non-ERE controlled land was razed by the Huns

It has taken a long time partly because the initial gameplay was poor and overly confusing. As a Total War fan and veteran it took way more time for me to learn this game than any other. It also took substantial work by the dev to finally get some semblance of balance to the game (although there are some issues yet remaining). 

For Total War Vets and Pointers in general:
if you want to create an indomitable empire and kick every single butt, then this isnt the game to do that in

its a lot more preservation oriented in the gameplay especially the Roman Empires

The Barbarians are coming and they will sack and raze the heck out of your territories and cities even those with whom you are not at war (they will still raid your territory)

it requires much more balancing of politics, food supplies, public order, and squalor (Which I found to be a plus)
its not like other Total Wars where you build a few buildings and you'll never need to worry about public order again, public order changes and so does squalor and food supplies
its also not like Rome II where you just kick butt and politics basically goes in your favor, you actually have to watch the political side of things
also you can't just build building and get rich, you have to work at creating cash flow

the Huns are pretty ridiculously powerful FYI 

Overall:
it takes some time to learn even for TW veterans
it actually takes some management and and maintenance to succeed unlike other total wars
simply building the Biggest army and moshing over everyone isnt an effective strategy in this one so yeah
dont even bother with all the overpriced DLCs (ive played the game fine without them)

Alright, so a couple hours in and a bit of a gamble to get the game right off the bat.
Not sure what to say, but this is one heck of a step up from Rome 2. It looks the same, it sounds similar but it's a whole different world. 

The campaign map is simply beautiful. I love the added detail and all the little changes!
The added touches to razing & besieging a settlement is much welcomed eye-candy.
Everything from birds to more detailed trees simply brought the campaign map to life!
I gotta love the increased camera zoom as well. Certainly doesn't make you feel boxed in anymore.

The actual battles are good, still getting the hang of the units and all the little nuances with them.
I can't say I adore the colour schemes though. Watching a bunch of Gothic spearman in battle kinda looks like a grey-green blob moving back and forth, until you zoom up close. I certainly miss the banners as well. I'm not too excited about these floating markers!

The UI is gorgeous on TW:Atilla. All the hype about easier to read trees, and skill progression is well met. It's so much easier to find things on the Campaign Map Screen. Everything is beautifully organized, CA really worked on getting everything streamlined and easier to access!

So far I've been happily playing the past few hours hitting 40-50 FPS on pretty much Max Quality. Not a lot of tweaking with the graphics so far, I just went along with the recommended!

I certainly look forward to getting more play time!",1424232746,1456640349,True,16,2,0.544521033763885498,0,True,False,False,76561198074274224,251,9,12247,0,6994.0,1583093356,,

With that out of the way I can say this is a solid Total War release. The gameplay is generally similar to Rome II, so if you're familiar with that it won't take too much effort to adapt to the new features in Atilla. The campaign map has seen the most change, with features such as sanitation, settlement razing and religion adding new depth to strategy. Also making a return (thankfully) is the family tree, and management of generals/governers. 
The battles are very similar to Rome II, no surprises as the game is built more or less on the same engine. Performence still could use some work however, as larger battles can reduce framerate significantly. 
Fortunately this game was also much more polished on release when compared to previous titles. Although some bugs have sprung up here and there, it wasn't a total mess.
There is plenty of content here, even in the base game, and if you're willing to fork out a small fortune, there is a further fortune of content to be found in the DLCs

To sum up:

Pros:
-New features
-Family tree returns
-Solid release (compared to past titles)
-High replayability

Cons:
-Terrible DLC marketing formula
-Not amazing optimisation

Verdict: 7.5/10 (only if bought on sale!)

And if you are playing as Western/Eastern Rome, prepare for a terrible terrible experience. Not as in a poorly made experience, but as a mentally challenging one, as you will have to watch your glorious empire crumble xD It really captures how it was in history during this time.
The only sad thing about this particular topic is that you do not get a small Roman Faction to build a large empire with, you only have these 2 giant ones that slowly crumbles.

The return of the family-tree and all the new political options you have with it is really nice, 10/10 for that.

Little sad with so many faction-DLCs, that is something that could have been reduced I feel. But then again if you do not want to pay more, you don't have to, the base-version offers plenty as it is.

16,21438505,english,"I managed to pick this game up when it was on sale. Let me start by saying if you can get it on sale it is worth it! but I wouldn't pay full price, go buy Rome II not this. 
While there are new features added to battle, such as the ability to create paths for troops to follow. Someone decided it would be a good idea to remove the ability to drag troops information around the battlefield. setting up troops is a pain! If you set them up and forget to lock them in a group, there goes your formation, and good luck setting up troops with the hostile force charging you.
Battles just feel stiff. The camera controls akwardly and often times goes where you don't want it or sets at an angle that doesn't allow you to see the battle unfolding before you. The battles rarely last more than 5 minutes, even with full stacks of armies the battles end way to quickly. Morale seems to break if a hand-full of men die, and troops drop like flies  within seconds.
The part of the game I found most enjoyable was the campaign map. Playing Politics with the other factions and building power through offices and marrages was very enjoyable. I spent most of my time building new buildings and forcusing on economy, trade and public happiness. This part of the game I feel improved the system of Rome II. however, this was the only part of the game I thourghly enjoyed.
Overall the Campaign map has improved vastly; However, battles feel stiff and much less enjoable than other Total War games. The battles are also exteremly short. If you can get this game on sale it is worth it, its not bad. But do not pay full price, if you don't have if buy Rome II instead and wait for a sale.

25,21408536,english,"There has been a lot of mixed feelings about the game and let me state the facts. Yes this gave has dlc up the ass. Yes Vikings is one of said day one dlcs. They are meh weirdly enough. If you want the most op faction in the game, be the huns you know what the game is named after. Romans if you want to pretty much lose everything to npcs having a hayday with you but there right there. You can play as both the Romans and the Huns which I count as history's bad asses with no dlc and no dlc touches these faction. 

I ended up gettin all of the dlcs when they where on sale and tested through them, I can safely say only one of them was fun for me and I end up going back to none dlc factons because they are more enjoyable to me, namely the Goths personally.  You can say ""But there is a DLC race that don't take snow damage."" ""Then take a hoard faction or another one that starts out near or around the middle east. There is no snow and on top od that, there is desert damage that only one race that you can use wont take and that is all year around. Desert>Winter"" 

So honestly the dlc is ignorable due to giving they get you better choices anyways. 

There was talk of this game being to easy, I will farly say if you have not played Total war Rome- the first one, or shogun 2, this game even on the easier Difficulty will wreak your face if you pick to many wars. Since they will avoid their large armies to attack and raid your weaker settlements. I even end up using the AI mode in battles to test it out, it blindly charges in your horses so don't use it with cav but, if your using it with your ranged and melee inf, you will find it handles them rather well, granted doing better attacking then defending which is something to keep in mind.  It makes a line with your more numorous melee with your lesser melee being ordered to attack who they counter with the ranged trying to aim down their leader or other ranged when the melee are locked together.  

So the Ai is possible and fine to play with. 

The whole management of your family members is lack luster at best. There has been rage at it since the person wants to do the thing but it blocks them for no reason other then ""Because I said so"" Which is true but after using it so much. I can safely say you can fully ignore it and still do fine other then looking for a wife here and there. You get infuance over time which is what you use for actions only in that screen. It has a chance to fail but when it does, like trying to get someone into office, it will want you to take another 20 infuance form the person you are pushing to get in office or form your king so keep that in mind and it will save you form a lot of the rage. 

For the balance of power, its a system that I would be happy if it was removed, you can do actions to gain or lose control. When dominance is a % of how much more infuance you have over your none family leaders with in your ranks. the median of these - the % of balance of power. So long its in a tick of middle, its ignorable. 

A lot of the reasons that people bring up why this game is shit, don't even matter since it effects gameplay vary little or you can just rolfstomp them after you make an army like any other npc since they are locking npcs factions for you to use really.

With that all said, The only thing I like in this game over something like Total war, Shogun 2 is the hoard system and how citys group up together to have the same stats making microing them soooo much easier. So if you hate DLC because you don't even know what it does, play Shogun the only DLC it has is more or less another campain mode which is some of the Dlcs for this game is.",1456245960,1456245960,True,3,0,0.540664136409759521,0,True,False,False,76561198039267144,607,21,7240,0,3417,1508807219,,

Now first off, i wanna mention the low performance issues and what CA said about it: 

""Taking to the Total War forums, an official Creative Assembly spokesperson outlined each of the graphics settings and explained why 'Extreme Quality' won't be the best setting for... well, anyone. "" Please note, that the Extreme Quality setting is meant for future graphics cards, not for current gen,"" the spokesperson said. ""This is why it's above Maximum Quality.""

Nice Bu11sh*t.

Other than that, the game has little to no bugs. I had a crash once while i sent two agents at the same time on the same guy, the first one succeeded but i don't know, the code pattern was not meant for two agents to do that at the same time when one succeed so i crashed. Not really a big deal honestly.

Finally, when christianity religion chapter comes up, i hope your 5 billion men that you spent 120 turns building up to fight off the 7 armies of the huns are dissolved because the game will f*ck you up by breaking your food and money income. I don't know what happened but now my armies are starving with a BIG -100 food (and i own 22 settlements) and a big income of 120 compared to my previous turn that had 168 food and 11k income....

So, the day they'll fix their g0ddamn game and they'll stop bringing up lame a.ss excuses like ""oh, it's meant for futur pc that'll cost you 3 thousand dollars"" i'll recommend this potientialy masterpiece.

= The Huns and Attila are the most challenging threat in any TW game
- AI is more strategic oon the campaign and a little better in battles then in Rome II
- On the campaign, the factions, both in difficulty and position very drasticly 
= Music is probably the best soundtrack since Shogun 2 ( dark, drums, apocalyptic)
= The Western Roman Empire is the hardest campaign in any TW game
- Expansive unit rosters, much more than in Rome II, though are sometimes repetitive
- The famil tree makes you care about characters again and the plitcial system helps with role-playing
- Horde system is incredibly well-designed with 10 building slots and a good pace of sack/razing, build, repeat

- Razing, as it creates proinces owned by no one and gives atmosphere, but can lead to the map becoming too barren
- DLC, there is A LOT of it, though it, in my opinion, some of the best in the series
- Factions, in general are less diverse then in Rome II, as its moslty barbs, romans, and some desert units, instead of having gauls, britons, germanics, greeks, romans, etc.
- Probably the hardest TW to date, so its difficult to get into, but rewarding once you learn it
- Religion also returns, but outside of a small buff, doesn't play that big of a role, and the conversion percent of 35% is too steep


You'll hate...

- Multiplayer is identical to Rome II, with even less preset maps, making it one of the most barren in all TWs
- Politics is still a pain in the ass to manage, and is extremelly confusing and barely explained in the tutorial
- Germanic troops are everwhere, both in playable and non-playable factions

If you asked me to score it...

Overall: 8/10

It's not the best Total War game, but its definetly a great one, and despite some of its problems with rosters and a bare multiplayers, the challenging campaign with a varity of starting positions and playstyles, puts it pretty well up there on the list of best TW games.

I love it so much that bought a whole new computer just for it.

Honestly this is a good game, and I know it's odd to give a bad review to a game you like, but when you're really engrossed in a campaign and it starts taking double the ammount of time it did in the beginning to end a turn, it's beyond frustrating.

I overlooked this when the game was newer. I figured it was like Rome II, that the developers would gradually make it run vastly better over the course of a number of patches, but here we are a year later and no better off despite lots of DLC patches. I don't actually mind the DLC, I feel like it actually adds something to the game, but when you're only making DLC instead of the patches to make the game run tolerably well, it's clear your priorities are wrong.

Don't get me wrong. There's a lot ot enjoy here. The siege escalation feature is one of my favorite things ever in a total war game, and the graphics, if you can turn them up, are breathtaking. In so many ways this game feels like What Rome II promised us in that very misleading carthage demo so long ago, but unless you have a computer made by in the workshop of the gods of technology, all of the fun of this game will just feel like a taunt, reminding you of what you're missing out on.",1455999788,1455999788,False,5,0,0.506972730159759521,14,True,False,False,76561198006591585,468,101,34988,0,23447,1597786107,,

53,21343966,english,"Although I was hesitant at first due to Rome II, I bought it on sale. After I started playing it I was simply amazed how GOOD this game is. Battles are more tactical, morale finally plays huge role, I had many battles that I won due to good flanking or clever use of units abilities (whistling arrows etc). Sieges are epic now, I basically always play sieges on map because cities look really good and real(I used to always auto resolve in earlier Total wars). Thankfully CA managed to overcome limitations of game engine and units again fight properly (but there are some good looking fight animations too). Cavalry charges are epic and properly managed can quickly destroy units. Cities now require more managment due to squalor and it is worth mentioning that buildings built on campaign map can be seen in siege(battle map) too. AI is better, it tries to  flank and go for unprotected units (archers for example with no spearmen support). Downsides I found are that some of the DLCs could be more rich in content (celts, longobards and viking forefathers culture packs) and I feel there could be more variety of units. Overall I think the game is good now and I especially recommend buying it on sale with all DLCs.

55,21346161,english,"Total War: ATTILA is a great game. It is a definite step from TW:Rome 2, and is one of the best in the entire Total War series. 

Compared to Rome 2, the factions play very differently, and that makes the whole game generally better. The game takes place in the beginning of the migration period, a time of great turmoil in Europe, Asia and the Middle East. You have Attila and his Huns, two declining Roman empires (East and West) a great desert power in the Sassanids, various migrating germanic tribes, and norsemen bringing the wrath from North. No matter what faction you choose, you will see a lot of action.

The game is as I mentioned earlier a bit more varied than other Total War games. For example, as the Huns, you can not own any settlements. You can only raze, subjugate and sack. Raze is another new feature, which allows you to pretty much erase the settlement from existance. If a Settlement gets razed, it can be rebuilt, but this cost a lot of gold and time. Both the Roman Empires start with a lot of settlements, and is constantly attacked from every possible direction. They also have to deal with ambitious generals who constantly threaten to rebel and start their own Roman Empire. Other factions offer yet different playstyles. You should definitely try a little bit of them all. In the core game, there are a lot of different factions to choose from. You really don't need the DLC's. If you still want to pick up a DLC, I very much recommend the Age of Charlemagne. It's pretty much a brand new game. 

This game feature more politics than Rome 2, and we also get the reintroduction of the much missed Family Tree. The politics are still not perfect, even by Total War standards, but a step up from the previous titles.

All in all, I very much recommend this game to both Total War veterans and first timers both. As a first timer, you will probably spend quite a while figuring out stuff, but there are factions that are reasonably easy in the beginning of the game, and you can also SAVE/LOAD as much as you need to. The Veterans of the Total War series will surely love and recognize the genius in this game.

The DLC included a new style of early medieval gameplay that I've always dreamt of. So now, I bought the game and played a few games, after all the negativity that I have thought of about this game, I liked it. It's good to have another cool and new total war game in my steam library.

I rate this game 7/10 Needs Improvement in Battle and Campaign AI, and it also needs better DLC's that are worth buying.

Go ahead and grab it if it's on sale. You can also try playing it when free weekends of the game come up if you're interested in buying it.",1455869108,1455869185,True,4,0,0.522696852684020996,2,True,False,False,76561198062584577,167,15,4476,0,801,1600655254,,
76,21310098,english,"This game has too many things going on. It tries to be as in depth as Crusader Kings but as simple as Rome II and fails at both. It lacks the insane amoung of options that you can choose from Crusader Kings but it is not as clean as Crusader Kings in displaying the info so you get caught up searching countless buildings and research. This game is 5 times more complex and diffecult that Rome II. CA changed the way that the Total War games did their building system to appeal to more people by making it simpler, which I hated, but it came back with a vengance in this game. The Horde system works better then it is in Rome 1 but it seems like the tech tree keeps you slogging with bad units for EVER. Im sure a lot of people like this game but this is the ONLY Total War game I would not recommend to others simply because it is just too great of a departure from the normal Total War format.

One thing that upsets me is the continued downsizing of the ultra unit size; 120 men simply isn't enough for infantry and 60 Cavalry is often very underwhelming. The 40 unit battles that you can have in some ways does make up for this, considering I've had huge engagements with up to 4 full stack armies on either side(mind you the max is 40v40 at one time), but that kind of battle is rare but incredibly fun.

And, when on sale.

The good:
-actual defensive positions in town and minor settlements
-higher ground in towns and settlements actually helps in defending a static line
-Cavalry actually do shock damage
-Archers actually have decent range
-Morale/combat mechanics are better joined (sending in archers with knives after their arrows are gone can actually stabilize a defensive line for a spell)
-Archers can finally fire up and over buildings onto units rather than needing a direct line of sight
-Mercenaries seem cheaper than in Rome II (except for some higher end units, like Onagers) 
-When attacking towns, double right clicking on it will cause selected units to automatically find the fastest way around buildings (which the player is shown right away, which means you have the option of changing said orders if you don’t like the path they have been set on around corners, etc)
-Enough gold (10-20000 pieces) can sway a faction to join a war with you, even if they don’t like you. This includes the Huns.
-Players will be forced into diplomacy (i.e., joining in wars and making friends/allies that way), subjugation does not really work in the long run (except for the AI, of course)
-Governors are quite useful, and gain levels and abilities as they go along (just like the generals)
-Upgrades for armies and Governors are tree based now, so you can plan ahead finally (unlike Rome II’s system)
-Playing as Rome is terrifying and exciting, and many players will pull all 10 armies back to Italy (and perhaps spain) in order to ride out the storm. All of Gaul, Britannia, and Africa go up in flames through rebellion, famine, settlement destruction, separatist movements, and separatist movements to the separatist movements. One may eventually see Romanesque factions eventually, that call themselves “Africa”, “Asia”, and even “Egypt” or “Illyria.”  Pulling through that storm (usually about 30-50 turns), takes a long time, but is immensely satisfying. One may even find himself making trade agreements and alliances with Roman factions that split from old areas you lost 100 turns before to rebellion.
--The Huns burn everything to the ground. Again and again, and have some terrifying units to play with. Join in a few wars with them and you may win their favor…
--Incredible graphics on high end machines




Problems; The old, the new, and the frustrating:
[EDIT: some of these can be fixed with mods]

-Military alliances are great for maintaining a good relationship with factions you are trading with, but worthless when someone actually declares war on YOU. If you call your allies in to join you in war, 90% will say “No. fuck you”, and your alliances are all severed. This means you will have to either reload, or spend 10-20000 gold trying to reestablish military alliances you had previously had with them in order to keep them from breaking trade agreements, and eventually coming after you. This means that whenever someone declares war on you, you are alone, regardless. 
-Satrapy states are free to rebel against you the second someone else declares war on you. This means subjugating a faction (when taking their last settlement) is all but pointless if they can rebel the next turn when some piss-ant faction comes after you.  
-Diplomacy only happens through grotesque amounts of gold and/or with the maxim “Let me join in this war alongside the faction I want to like me, and yes he likes me more eventually, then make a trade agreement, then make an alliance. ” While it can be fun, it gets old fast as it becomes clear that this is the only way to make allies.
-Food surplus means nothing, other than that food is getting to your armies and minor “growth” modifiers around your empire.
-Food is province based now, and by turn 100 all hell breaks loose with food shortage modifiers hardcoded to the game (apparently their take on history…). This means you really have to build a wheat farm and a cattle farm in all your minor settlements, and both Fish ports and food emporiums in your major cities to counteract the worldwide “shortage” of food. Even as Rome, soon you have a 2000 surplus of food even in winter, but sure as heck certain regions without such buildings are not getting any of it. This leaves very few spots for trade based/economy based buildings in all settlements, which is a shame because it leaves little room for open ended city building.
-Sanitation is cool, but it can get out of hand:  destroying entire armies if stationed in the affected city. This means another spot of your city is used up with the aqueduct. 
-Another location in your major cities will be used up by building coliseums and theaters trying to keep the people from rebelling, when playing as Rome.
-Immigration becomes a problem, and eventually goes to about a -9 modifier for all regions. Some have said upping the tax rate gets the immigrants to leave, but I haven’t seen that work.
-When playing as Western Rome, all the hardcoded events/modifiers that decrease public order (at worst, -20 for food, -9 for immigrants, and so on) means that little can be done but build food based buildings and   hope your religion can pull you through. That wouldn’t be bad, if it were possible to convert to Paganism easily (and let your theaters and coliseums do the work). This means the game pushes you to try and be Christian.
-War is sometimes declared in very odd ways. 3 factions in the British Isles and Ireland were my trade partners, as Rome, and I was on good terms with them. One minor settlement faction suddenly declared war on me while it was being sieged by the other two. Immediately after that, the siegers (two other factions I was trading with) themselves declared war on me as well. And yet they continued to siege the original minor faction to declare war on me, and destroyed it. All this despite the fact that I was trading with all three of them. Very, very odd.
-Second tier units now take 2 turns to muster (which can be crippling, if an enemy is bearing down on you), and said units are barely better than the 1st tier and so on.
-All units are outdone by the overwhelming power of artillery. The Artillery is now so accurate it can hit cavalry units at full gallop as they bear down on said artillery unit (to try and kill it off). Often they never make it!
-A player may not want to bother researching any military improvements when considering how expensive the units are (and time needed to muster them), and so may only research economy techs to try and make some money. Early game economies are so fragile you are counting down to the last 10 gold pieces sometimes. A total war game perhaps should not be that unforgiving towards being warlike…..
-Christian buildings are immensely expensive, so you won’t be able to afford them (and their public ordering abilities) for a long time, but Rome is Christian, and spreading your religion is paramount, but no, you can’t do it…
-Faction politics, and gaining office for loyal subjects seems interesting at first but eventually becomes frustrating; every event usually means you either lose influence or control, and your power slowly ebbs away. Not that it matters that much…
-Generals eventually rebel against you if they live long enough, and so upgrading them as they gain experience loses its charm since you are constantly thinking “When will I need to kill him?” Getting promotions for them does not seem to work either, in the long run. Creative assembly really needs to play some crusader kings, and learn how to balance their political in-game systems so that players have options, rather than feeling like they are simply a sad witness to history through a lackluster historical simulation of Roman politics (where the general always makes a move for power).",1449948239,1455618309,True,1033,47,0.918853998184204102,34,True,False,False,76561198015281881,208,15,24083,0,6623,1588525721,,

19,21241983,english,"tl;dr - Creative Assembly put in a stupid design choice that makes it virtually (maybe even literally) impossible to actually succeed in-game. Curious as to what that design would be? Search up ""Total War: ATTILA Town Center Convert and just take a gander at the forums it pulls up.

Now I don't usually write reviews about games that I play. But Total War: ATTILA actually deserves this review. The amount of pain I endured while playing this heap of garbage was immensely disgusting. Now saying that this game is disgusting MIGHT be a bit of an overstatement; it has the basics of a Total War game, and that's all I really look for in a Total War game. That's all I look for and at least SOME sense of logic. You see in Total War: ATTILA Creative Assembly decided they wanted to introduce a very... stupid design...

Introducing Empire: Total War all over again. Just like in Empire: Total War when you capture a settlement it just never becomes happy, which is stupid. All other Total War games have had it so that the populations of captured settlements gradually become happy and content with your rule. Well with Total War: ATTILA and Empire: Total War Creative Assembly said ""fuck that shit"" and decided that settlements should constantly hate you and be rebelling against you every two turns!

Now this review is on Total War: ATTILA, not Empire: Total War, so I suppose I should say 'why' the settlements constantly hate you in Total War: ATTILA. Two words: Town Centers... You see when you capture a settlement of a different culture (which you'll be doing A LOT) it has different 'town center' than your faction's town centers. So what you have to do is convert that town center to your factions version of the town center. Now, that sounds alright, except that it is nowhere NEAR alright. Because not only does it cost WAY too much gold, I'm talking like 8000 Gold (the amount you make in around 8 turns, roughly 8 YEARS in game time) just to convert a SMALL LOW TIER TOWN, AND IF YOU DON'T CONVERT THE CENTER THEN THE POPULACE WILL JUST HATE YOU FOREVER UNLESS YOU FEEL LIKE WASTING A WHOLE ARMY ON KEEPING THE PEACE IN THOSE SPECIFIC SETTLEMENTS!

So what does that mean? Well it should be obvious to those that are familiar with the Total War franchise, but just in case this is your first encounter with it I'll explain: What it means is that you're wasting an army on just trying to keep your empire together rather than going off and helping you keep up the conquest. So you're wasting money just putting those armies (that you are paying the big bucks for) in every province you capture that, for the record, aren't producing enough income to make it worthwhile since you haven't converted the town center yet!

You'll even find AI with settlements that hate them too because the AI itself can't even afford to convert their town centers! This is such a stupid design choice that even the game can't function with it! You're better off just preying on those with the same cultures as you as you will already have the same town centers as them. But then in later parts of the game you are FORCED to have to eventually fight against a different culture, and if you don't capture all of their settlements then there's no way to defeat them! So it's either just rush killing your enemy quick enough so that you can make it back to your own empire in time to kill the townsfolk that are rebelling for the five hundredth time before they end up capturing half your empire, or just dying. Does that sound fun?

Now for those of you who are new to Total War then continue reading this paragraph, for those who are familiar with it you can just skip to the next paragraph. Let me tell you how a normal Total War game works: You amass an army and go out and conquer enemy faction's settlements, by doing this you get more income from those settlement's taxes. The more you conquer, the more you grow, but with Total War: ATTILA it's the opposite. The more you capture the more people hate you and feel like rebelling every two turns and you actually lose money from investing in armies to keep the peace in those unruly settlements. 

I really wish that this game could've just worked, but the more and more I play it the more I just hate it. This isn't the only problem I have with Total War: ATTILA but it's definitely my biggest. Other problems I've found include: A boring setting that just doesn't really inspire me into conquering it all, literally everyone gets killed by Attila the Hun when he begins his murder spree, the units in this game feel lacking as you definitely feel that their more calvary based (which is to be expected from Attila the Hun, but you're not always going to be playing as Attila, rather you're going to be playing as some barbarian tribe), all those reasons and a few more are why Total War: ATTILA has to be the WORST Total War I've ever played.",1455580134,1455580134,False,1,0,0.476969063282012939,0,True,False,False,76561198038099521,370,6,447,0,343,1456687446,,

Sometimes units are allowed to move during a turn other times they are not. I hate you guys for this. There is a reason SEGA went out of business, this is one such reason.

- Graphics were fine in Shogun 2, this is not any better and it is just as choppy as it can get. And please turn off that black crap that is airborne arrows. I do not need motion blur, just show the arrows. 

- Stop making me sit through your cut scenes betweenEVERY single turn. I am so tired of your crap history lessons.

Also, Medieval 2 was a great in its time for its castle sieges.

Edit: After more playtime on Attila, i can see that the optimisation is not as good as in Rome2, however the combat animations and lighting effects seem to have improved noticably, to the point that its difficult to choose between this or Rome2 as Rome2 plays very fluidly at a nice 30fps on my system on high graphics, whereas Attila on high is 15-20 fps, so theres very slight jerkiness to the actions of soldiers in combat.

Excerpt:

“The air was filled with smoke and blood.” There seems to be a lot of that in Creative Assembly‘s latest strategy title Total War: ATTILA, which–as you can imagine–takes place at the beginning of the end for the Roman Empire.

While you still have to buy the actual blood effects through silly DLC packs (I’ll get to that a bit later), ATTILA improves upon Rome II‘s engine and gameplay mechanics, adding more depth to the strategic map with scorched earth, mass migration, and the fertility of your provinces’ lands.

[...]

If the marauding hordes, crippling famine, and the implosion of Western Rome and its subsequent power vacuum weren’t enough, you now have to worry about enemies from within your faction as well. Polishing up Rome II‘s original dynasty system (or lack thereof), the nobles of your house and faction play important roles as governors, generals, and councillors, each position granting its own factional and personal bonuses. Without loyal retainers, your doomed to civil war–which, in its own way, can be played to your favor, expunging political rivals who bark louder than they can bite.",1455090226,1455090226,True,4,1,0.565295159816741943,7,True,False,False,76561197979334940,936,26,12132,0,7276,1578704989,,

98,21039182,english,"    I would definitely recommend this game to any total war fan. i mean, who dosent like the dark ages? the romen empire is crumbling, attila is F-ing things up, and the barbarians are starting there own kingdoms... sounds perfict for a total war game!!   

     In my opinion, its far better then rome 2 total war ever was. its like rome 2 done RIGHT.  i've not run into any game breaking bugs (if really any come to think of it) and the game has been runing smooth on high settings on my laptop.  theres not really anything i can say too bad about this game other then the dlc,  which is not that bad compared to other total war dlc list (""rome 2"") and the fact that the AI tends to occasionally cheat in the grand campaign.

      there is also new mechanics like: where you can raze cities and or re-colonize it (which is really awesome!!)   also besieging cities attila is Far better then any other total war game to date. for example, when you siege a city or town for a long period of time, the buildings and walls start to become dilapidated and run down from the siege. AND if the settlement is damaged during real time battle, like a catapult blowing up a building, it will show up on the campaign map and will have to be repaired if you own the city or decide to occupy it. you'll also have to deal with climate change, in where over the in game years it gets colder. forcing you to adapt or move your faction south.

  all in all, if you like total war or are a fan of the series like me, you'll like this one.  personally, I enjoy attila as much as I did with medieval 2 total war, and I liked 2005 barbarian invasion more so then 2004 rome 1. so this game (which is pretty much barbarian invasion 2) just worked for me.

Now I'm not about to say that they are wrong or that you shouldn't tear this game apart for that. However I am going to say that this is by far one of the most detailed and fantastic Total War games I have ever played. 

Having just gotten out of Rome 2 and prior to that Shogun 2 Fall of the Samurai with over 700 hours of gameplay between them I wanted a new experience and bought this game on the Lunar New Year sale of 2016 for a whooping $11.24, plus all the DLC for a total of $33.72 USD. Let me be clear this is probably the only way you should buy this game with the DLC, the base game has plenty to keep you interested but the DLC when it is not on sale is ridiculously over priced totalling $109.92 or an even more ridiculous $155.45 AUD. 

In short, buy this game when it's on sale. 

Now looking past that this game is amazing, in terms of graphics it's engaging, violent and looks very alive and real. You also get introduced to a whole new level of faction control, a lot of common Total War mechanics like food, religion, your faction's generals and/or nobles as well as your city's infastructure have been revamped to include new levels of detail and challenges, pay special attention to what your religion offers you it can be important. 

Then there is the 'horde' mechanic wherein you can disband all your settlements and become a fully migratory faction which offers you the benefits of both a city, with a slightly limited recruitment roster, and the mobility of an army. 

Overall this game offers exceptional detail and of all the Total War games the by far best empire management gameplay; it is absolutely fun, the DLC is just too expensive.

Has some lag issues that aren't found in Rome 2 and its end game is weak as the Horde simply burns everything to the ground leaving a barren, lifeless wasteland.  Not overly entertaining after the first grand campaign.  As always, the modding community has done a great job fixing the game for CA and Sega.

Attila is good when thought of as $15 Rome 2 DLC but is obviously unacceptable and certainly not recommedable as a stand alone $150 experience.

This review has to updated since the Attila today is completely different game. 
Attila became for CA the military test ground on which they play with all kind of experiments.
Attila is super brave attempt to make the game more chaotic and volatile. 
So, just imagine, weather conditions matter, winter is coming and food is becoming scarce. Nations are forced to go south and confilicts are highly possible. Barbarians move to Roman lands from every possible angle. Sanitation mechanics is new thing, plagues are possible, disease can spread rapidly.
Politics again matter, and the game seems more demanding then Rome 2.
The new expansion Age of Charlemagne brings the teaser of Medieval 3 possibly and it hits that swee spot. It is almost a different game and if you ask me - better one. The war weariness mechanics is something new and makes game more complex and strategic.

AI unfortunately is still dumb. They will sit and wait calmly their death while your archers are bombarding them. Maybe it is too much to change the AI, so the CA does not feel like making the huge step forward. Graphics are the best in TW game, no doubt about that.

Attila is supported by many mods so you can make it really challenging.

So, is it better than Rome 2? Or other TW games? 
Let me put it this way: It is newer, it is more strategic and looks better. Still, you do not have that wow  imersive effect you had while playing Shogun 2 or Medeival 2.

 Maybe a bit of soul is missing, but is still highly recommended game. Age of Charlemagne is a must have DLC.

29,20914982,english,"Yet another example of Steam needing to introduce a ""Meh"" option (I'm starting to get a bit tired of putting that!) Attila only just gets my recommendation. Let's go into why shall we.

Pros
- Sieges now have deployable barricades that can make all the differnece when outnumbered 10:1
- Boats now leave after landing troops so all naval units can be deployed
- Great, never-before-seen factions allowing for dozens of potential strategies
- Even larger scale battles than usual
- It's TW, it's awesome just by being that.

Cons
- Soooooo much DLC!! Ok the new Campaigns should be DLC but the factions?? Why are so many factions (not that there are that many even with the DLC) NOT included in the base game? What, did you release it too early or something? 'Cause that's your own damn fault, don't come running to us asking for more money because YOU didn't finish making the game before you released it!! If you didn't release it too early then: why?? Just why?
- No idea why but the cavalry in this one SUCKS! I mean, they maintain their strategic advantage but why are the so much worse than they were in EVERY OTHER TW EVER! For one who relies almost entirely on Cavalry Archers, this is the worst thing ever! They're not as fast and not as strong. (But much larger units)
- So few playable factions. Enough to make it interesting but not enough to make it into the Pros.

All in all a good game but not up to the TW standards I've come to expect and love. I personally would say bottom 3 TW games but still an amazing game in all.

Bad. Battle are a bit quick (however that might be the time period of smaller scale battles and I'd modded rome to slow it down),

37,20861144,english,"Let me start by prefacing this review: for all of its flaws, I still love Rome II.  Over a dozen patches, free and paid dlc, and some fantastic mods later, I think it stands as one of the absolute best Total War games.  Then here comes Attila, essentially an update to Rome I's Barbarian Invasion expansion, and I was very hesitant.  It seemed, and to an extent it is, a glorified expansion to Rome II set at the onset of the Dark Ages.  However, I think Creative Assembly has listened to the fans and paid attention to some of the best mods for Rome II such as Divide Et Impera and given fans what we've wanted from them since Rome II launched in 2013.  The differences from Rome II are not immediately all that noticeable.  It still runs on the same engine and battles and campaigns generally don't play that much differently from Rome II; however, its the small things that make enhance Attila.  Politics make a glorious return after being largely absent from Rome II and fit in very well with the era.  Siege escalation and spreadable fire are both fun new features that can make siege battles all that more dire for the defending faction.  Overall, Attila just feels really refined and polished, something Rome II was definitely lacking early in the few months to year after its launch.  My biggest complaint, and this is entirely subjective, is that I'm not a big fan of the era it takes place in.  The dark, ruined world of Attila just doesn't have the same appeal to me as the glorious classical conquests of Octavian, Hannibal, and Julius Caesar.  However, there are now plenty of mods available for Attila that change the start date not to mention the official expansions released that let you step into the shoes of Belisarius and Charlemagne.  I'd personally recommend the Justinian mod for Attila that essentially takes the experience of The Last Roman mini-campaign and lets you play it out on the Grand Campaign map.  In conclusion, if you're like me and you're a Total War fanatic, you'll buy Attila regardless, but if you're looking for an in to the Total War series, Attila isn't a bad place to start.  Personally, I prefer the setting of Rome II and its expansion but that should in no way take away from the greatness that is Total War Attila.",1454201080,1454201080,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198039597986,278,21,1795,0,1527,1598738388,,

40,20834311,english,"A few notes to people voting this game down because of DLC:
- Without DLC this is a finished game. You don't NEED to own EVERYTHING from this game.
- If you've exhausted the vanilla cultures you've played A LOT. You can buy ONE culture pack and play 100 hours again.
- I only agree that blood and burning should be included with vanilla. But on sale it's 80 cents more, so hey.

My point is: it's your CHOICE if you want to have all DLC cultures. You don't have to. You can do without. And if you are a really big fan of a certain DLC culture its 7,50 and less in sale, so not the end of the world.

ON TO THE ACTUAL GAME
Yes, there are new features (or rather features built upon Total Ware: Rome: Barbarian Invasion). Factions can migrate, you can build buildings in your horde, your mission goals are more specific per faction. There are Huns. I feel that is well done. But I have to compare this to Rome II now.

After playing a lot of Rome II and feeling disappointed, this is a relief of a game. It feels like they finished Rome II and then moved time forwards a few hundred years. In other words, this feels like a finished game.

To sum up some points why it's better then Rome II:
- Interface looks beautiful compared to Rome II's sterile windows. Unit cards have units on them instead of the vase paintings (a question of taste, but I don't know anyone who liked those). Moving portraits look a lot less pixelated (same settings!).
- Interface is also better organized: scrolls are back. There is a window for general details, for example. Not everything has to be managed from the interface at the bottom of the screen.
- Politics are much more polished and you feel like it's a working part of the game
- Building system is largely the same, but bonuses are slightly simplified, not a lot. It is however easier to get an overview of what is going on in tows because of the better interface.
- Skill system for generals and armies is simplified but works so much better. With a skill tree you at least know what you are doing and what your goals are.
- Campaign map: on the same settings as Rome II it looks much better. It's textured in a better way and the trees look nicer, making it look more detailed and a real earth surface.
- Better map tools: diplomacy map has more features, there's a strategic map with lots of filters, also in battle the strategic map is great.
- In battle unit flags are no more, now there are square indicators. But lets be honest: the flags didn't look like flags they acutally carried, so no realism lost there.

This list is a bit random I know. In short this game feels much more polished and finished than it's predecessor. I did play Rome II a lot and to say I didn't like it is a lie. But there were frustrations and I felt I needed mods.

With this [b]I have a bit of a wow feeling again for a Total War game[/b]. Not playing with mods this is just a great experience to play. I can focus on the different cultures and how to win instead of on the flaws of the game.

46,20783119,english,"At first when I started playing Total War: Attila, I could barley hang on to it. As soon as I began playing, the game made me sick. Even with a good computer set up, I still have trouble running this game in big battles on high quality. I wouldn't recommend this Total War game to someone who has a less than average PC, and loves graphics. 

The AI in the game is still muffed up. There would be beach city battles that I would be defending and there is a high chance I will have to spend the sixty minutes waiting for the game to end, all because the AI refused to beach a unit. 
The AI always magically knows where you are in the campaign, so there wont be much of a point in using guarilla warfare/ambush stance. 
The auto-battle mechanic in the campaign is awful, in which I may have better tier/trained units than the enemy, who usually use tier 1 spearmen, but they magically still have the edge in winning the battle. This is bad as well because your allies are usually out numbered. Eventually it turns into a numbers game. Who can throw around the most troops wins. Not who has the best strategy. 
Your AI ally always makes retarded ass decisions. For instance, I was the WRE and my ally, the ERE, was mainly in South Africa. This was somewhat later in the game. I sent a general and his army to help stop the Eastern invaders from pushing into South Africa. The point of no return was Alexandria, the spot we had to defend. Once my army got there, I place them in fortified stance. Everything was going smooth till the Eastern invaders arrived, immedialey the ERE AI took off from the defence leaving me to defend their own city by myself. If the ERE AI army was there, we would have easily beaten the Eastern Invaders back, but no, we got overran. 

I still have much to go on about. The game is addicting for what ever reason, and somehow I found it more interesting and fun to play versus Total War, Rome 2. The darker theme and setting in which the apocalypse is taking in due to Attila's reign across Europe. 
You have a family tree and potential diplomatic marriage to work on, which can be helpful and fun to roleplay with. 
Thankfully, the biggest and main reason I play total war is its mods. Without steam workshop I probably would never place Total War Attila. Radious makes the campaign fun to play as you can gain much better stats. Not only that, but Radious' unit mod finally brings diversity, which the vanilla units lacked.  
 
Above all, without mods and steam workshop. I would NEVER play Total War Atilla.

But the fundamental game is tighter and more compelling. I WANTED to play it. 

Is it Rome 1 or Shogun 2? No, it's not. It's still kind of sprawling, and lacks the focus of these high points. 
Is it possible to win a siege defense by sitting out at bay for half the battle, then hiding in trees with a single unit while the AI shits its pants? Sure. But CA at least TRIED to fix this stuff.
Is the game secretly a fiscal responsibility simulator with some armies thrown in for good measure? Yes, I guess it is, a little bit. 

The naval game fits well into the ground game. The whole thing really feels like total war, with the razing of entire provinces. And it's the little things, like how the province erupts into flames, or the civilians in a besieged city run around in panic. It's the blood and guts and the way that the AI actually fields halfway decent fighting forces, or at the very least armies that look impressive while you roll them over. 

It's not a Paradox game, but I can't hold that against a Total War entry. It's a Total War game, and a damn fine one at that. It's a shame that some reviewers with DLC axes to grind have relegated this to the dustbin of ""mixed"" user reviews, because if you like giant campaign maps that zoom down into little orgies of human destruction, this game's a winner.",1453522445,1453522445,True,25,4,0.647039234638214111,3,True,False,False,76561197969484311,1726,111,28149,0,27912,1500083569,,

I won't give you some gigantic review, I thought the horde system was fun and invigorating. The building system is much more fulfilling compared to Rome 2, and the razing/colonizing system is a nice little adventure/risk (thanks to them dang Huns lol). Playing as an existing empire is absolutely spectacular due to the threats that are presented. I have never lost a campaign in Total War, and though I haven't in Atilla yet, let me say... it was close.

All in all, it's a graphically appeasing, tactically stimulating breath of fresh air, not getting the fifth star only because of the usual bugs and crummy sales tactics. And to talk about the marketing of DLC's, I'm actually happier with it this time around because the lowered price of the base game makes buying an extra campaign, or a few other packs count as one ""full game"" price of $60.

Finally, the DLC's are intriguing. I haven't played any yet, but I have watched the Charlemagne one. Battles are different with a completely new set of units. Building is incredible. And the mods presented are a fantastic last touch. Unlike Rome 2, the DLC's like to me like they are very much worth the money, except faction packs which to me are still disappointing.

Review in progress after 50 hours here are my thoughts. 

Jan 1016


Attila is a good total war game that is brought down by obvious stupid design decisions.  Other review steam reviews go way more in depth but here are my two cents.  I don't understand why these design decisions were made when it seems so obvious what the consequences would be but that's CA for ya.

-Agents- There's no real progression with in 2 points (1 level) agents are super assassins. While in other games you could specialize in sabotaging armies or buildings or good ol fashioned general killing. Here agents can become amazing at everything 

-Generals - R2 made generals mandatory for armies so if your gen does get assasinated another is appointed next turn.

-Land/water - Another R2 thing.  Armies ""magically"" turn into boats to travels water, they don't need no ship.  What this does is make islands/water tactically pointless.  Sure ships are way better than soldiers in battle but units can cross water easily. Result - England being an island is pointless because an army can cross the English channel in one turn. 

-Economy - Some of the buildings are neat and it does take some thought balancing religion/economy/military/happiness but i rarely had any economic challenges with having 100k in the bank.

Family - They tried something new here with internal and family politics but it doesn't really work.  You have a family tree when you can marry off you daughters and son or appoint them to positions but it just becomes tedious after a while I just can't care about saving 3% on missile units or +5 food in a governed province when i have 100k in the bank. I get that CA is trying to do a ""Game of Thrones"" style thing but I wasn't carrying after a while and was just appointing at random to play faster.

Basically CA took out all the stuff that worked in Shogun 2 and put in stuff that doesn't work.  From my prospective it seems obviously that this stuff wouldn't work from the start but hindsight is 20/20.

83,20545238,english,"A good solid game with great innovations, but still some of the usual campaign balance issues inherent to the Total War franchise.

The idea of a horde becoming a roving city that can set up tents and be a movable economy is a great idea. It's really fun being a horde roving around Europe or the East, looting and burning. It's great to play as the destroyers, in an era when roving pagan hordes were staking their fortunes all over the world. The battles on those primitive forts are very entertaining. And seeing what cultures take root in your murderous aftermath.

The one down side is that TW still hasn't perfected a balanced enough campaign mode. In the hordes, for instance, you can barely afford any advanced units. So, I find that every game -- after a medium length of play -- becomes repetitive looting without much to work towards. Then, if you get advanced units, they're just way too expensive. And of course you get the badass but expensive horse archers right away, so I was quite disappointed when I unlocked Tier 3 units.

I'm spoiled because I compare this to games like Europa Universalis 4 and Crusader Kings 2. Paradox manages to generate games engines that balance themselves. Even the biggest country could easily get coalitioned by 15 other countries and busted down. Or in CK2, your king can easily lose all support from within the realm.  In TW, the game can much more easily be too easy or too hard, depending on who you play.

That being said, there are some amazingly fun factions to play. The Vikings were a great one. I just find like most TW games I've played, the campaign rarely feels worth pursuing to the end. The ease or difficulty always feels like it has more to do with when my troops run than it does AI cleverness.

I wish they'd gotten a little more original with the DLC factions, generating more original units etc. Also, if TW is all about the battles, I thought the sample battles offered here were pretty darn vanilla. Had a friend over I knew wouldn't enjoy campaign mode, so I tested them and realized I could easily generate a cooler battle in like two turns than play those.",1452885534,1452885534,True,3,0,0.504641175270080566,0,True,False,False,76561198066592743,106,19,43165,0,12032,1562652923,,

But then you get insanely rampent cheating AI in the form of Attila himself and his Huns.
Attila gets infinite money, infinite armies and just wants to fuck you up, and only you.
He will send 12 doom stacks of the best units in the game to wipe you out and everytime you kill an army he sends he will spawn another one and this never stops.
Then you kill Attila and cut off his head but he was only 'pretending to be dead' and respawns with an even bigger and badder doom stack that will blow your entire 3 stack away.
Then you kill him by sending assassins and stab him two more times and he runs off alive, still getting his doom stacks that have either blown your entire empire apart or they burned the small cities breaking your economy and killing you slowly.
The game up until Attila and his doom stacks is decent but then the game literally shits on you for playing it.
Then came the AoC DLC that offered a more Medieval like game which was also decent up until Charlemagne started doing the exact same thing that Attila does with infinite max level, max tier armies.

Attila TW is a good game. 

Sometimes i swear they are releasing these titles just too close to each other for there to be any real difference or reviewable content.

So I am going to cut to the chase about total war games. If you haven't played any total war games you should play Rome total war the original. Now, I'm not being an old fart and trying to make you play a bad game with awful graphics because RTW is still, by contrast of todays games, still very pretty. It has some terrific units and the combat is some of the best on the TW series and against all the other TW games it is a serious competitor.

Its really a highly must have RTS. TW Empire is also one of a kind and an epic game set in a slightly more modern world I would consider it a TW essential  much like RTW. Shogun 2 TW has some truly epic combat moments that you can only experience in shogun 2 but the world map is useless and after 20 turns the whole map is populated with just a few factions and diplomacy just trails away into asking for peace treaties that never last, even fully modded with radious mod the map does not last long enough. Rome 2 is a fair game and die hard fans of RTW should give it a shot, however i only really feel that by playing the romans would you get the full Rome 2 experience as most the fun combat situations seem geared toward roman tactics and the other faction tactics seem to not be as immersive or suitable for the style of play they tried to capture from RTW original.

That brings us to Attila total wars. 

They have added some awesome content similar to plotting against your family or royal court. Some of the content just feels a little rushed though like for example the Picts were well know in British empire as nomads and were for a considerable time only allowed female leaders, however this is not in the game. On most units (something i adored from previous titles) the unit descriptions as mostly none existent and quite often talk about other ranting's unrelated to the unit. The tribes are all  a little muddled its like no one took time to research or make sensible assumptions about what territory belonged to what tribe and importantly what areas would have been considered 'no-mans land' which was a very important part on ancient history in the ancient world. Instead it is all sort of vague and computer gamey which you could forgive but previous war games have been very detailed even if wrong it had immersive value as if somebody had tried really hard.

So what I mean by all this is Attila TW has lost a really important part of its gameplay and that is being able to right click on a units and read all the interesting things.

I have not been able to find a way to give land away in diplomacy which is really essential in most modern RTS as it ads to the plotting and general immersion and I'm a little disappointed its no longer available and the old RTS strategy of 'The enemy of my enemy is my friend' seems to be slipping out of its content. i would also have liked to be able to plot against others even if the results were only slight or restricted to non family members in my family. it wouldn't have been hard to implement but it seems there are no options for plotting against people outside of your royal court or family even when they are in your family tree they just sit there taking up space, Awesome.

-this is just a good idea-

I would have liked it if there were options to capture other family members after a war for ransom and torture. Depending on the torture method the said family member would get a new trait, like blind or frail disposition. torture could reveal insights or just serve as warnings to others they then would be able to ransom family members back. Torture could be different for example the Europeans had a habit of displaying prisoners for weeks sometimes months in public with little food or water, the middle eastern counties had a habit of blinding prisoners and the roman and Greek countries regularly castrated their prisoners.

So to sum up it feels rushed. It is rushed. Its very similar to Rome 2. It has good ideas but they never really started to blossom. The combat is fine and similar to some of the finest TW battle you can have. Its even a very good game and I'm sure I will play if many more times and I also recommend it.

--edit--

i would also enjoy the game more if i didnt have to pay for blood effects with that in mind i wont be making anymore total war reviews in the future.

when i pay for a game i dont expect to be asked for more money unless there are new parts of the game to explore. i mean the difference is between game enhancement and stuff that should already be in the game things like gore, units and playable factions that were in the initial release should be included in the game on release. it just lazy to try to force people to pay for that sort of content.

if for egsample there was a new campaign and it enhanced gameplay significantly this is accectable. but i own all total war game up to date some i have paid for twice and i have always paid for all dlcs. if they release the gore DLC again im just going to play my old total war games and im pretty sure im not alone on that.

Its easier cause you have less enemies and more money. Your only enemy at the start is really just the Persians and the Goths.

I didnt encounter any bugs, except flying elephants but that was pretty funny XD
well i dont like that the fighting is really quick and troops rally too quick and then regroup again,

The family tree is fun and once in my Eastern playthrough my right hand man general backstabbed me and started a civil war which was really fun to fight and play, i havent had that much fun since i played Shogun 2. I also had a huge battle, where i was in war with the sassanid empire and i made a huge push unit i came to their capital, there i was defeated and i had no one to defend my conquered cities, i had one army on the way but before that their faction leader and 2 more full stack armies attacked the conquered city, i had a garrison with 2 spear unites, 2 archers and 1 sword man and i defeated 3 full stack armies, this was in very hard, i was sweating like fucking hell, that was probably the best battle i ever fought in a total war game by far! Then there was another moment where the Western Roman Empire fell to barbarians and rebels and i wanted to reclaim the holy city of Roma and Carthago, that was fun too, i sent full legions to Africa and three other full legions to Italy and started reclaiming the lost lands!

4,20143636,english,"Let me just start by saying that this is not your traditional Total War game. If you're looking to forge an unstoppable empire and assert cultural authority across the entirety of the campaign map, do not get this game.

In past TW titles, you are the architect of an empire the world will never forget. Attila does not ask for this. Instead, your aim is to survive until a certain date. This particularly applies to sedentary factions like West/East Rome. If you wish to play as anyone else, you will be given missions to loot and plunder regions, as opposed to conquer them. Of course, should you choose to conquer, there is an option for that. But unlike its predecessors, incorporating a recently conquered region doesn't reap the same benefits as it used to. In Attila, you're usually left with a city lacking in food and/or sanitation. You'll find yourself pouring more money into rebuilding its infrastructure and economy than creating armies. Whether you feel this is worth it is up to you, but personally, the incentive is lacking.

Now, here's the nit and grit.

PROS:

- Return of the family tree
- Refined political mechanics (you actually have to start caring about your generals and statesmen or they might mutiny)
- Beautiful graphics
- Concise UI, tech trees and building trees
- Ability to raze regions (helpful if you want extra dough, or to keep enemies from occupying as fertility is extremely downgraded)
- VIKINGS GOD DAMN IT!
- Archer units are actually useful now
- Noticeable AI improvements both in battle and on the campaign map (though, CA still has a lot of work to do in this department)
- Community still as great as ever!

CONS:

- Huns are OP, they literally spawn out of nowhere (how the hell is this fair CA!?)
- Lack of unit variations for barbarian armies. Actually no - just a lack of units in general.
- Essentially Rome II with mods and texture skins
- Why is everything on fire. We get it, Rome was dying, but Europe wasn't s*** on by Satan.
- DLC clusterf*** (blame SEGA, not CA)
- Battles are far too quick, so I would suggest a quick trip to the workshop as there are plenty of fixes. Play the campaign for a few hours, see what you want and don't want, then tailor to suit your desires.

I enjoyed my first campaign immensely. It's nice having the option of campaigning as a variety of different factions, with different stories and start areas.

The multiplayer is relatively balanced (though quite empty most of the time). 

My issue came when I tried to start my second campaign as the Huns. For a game named 'Attila', you'd think they'd put a lot of focus on the horde mechanics. I'm afraid that on the upper difficulty levels, hordes are just too weak. Your expansion held back by total reliance on growth, your armies are crippled by the difficulty of maintaining your economy (sacking nets you very little, raiding is inferior to camping). 

Good luck starting a 4th horde before your enemies have 5+ armies, that they will send after you. ALL of them. No matter how far away from their territory you are, they know where you are and will hunt you to the edges of the map. And they'll invite their friends to join the hunt. My campaign has just ended in the very north eastern edge, where my 3 battered hordes were destroyed by 8 full armies, which had chased me from Italy. These 8 armies belonged to 5 different factions, and I had never interacted with any of them. I would honestly be ok with the Huns if you could just fix this ridiculous witch hunt.

12,20374539,english,"This game doesn't deserve the ""mixed reviews"" it's getting. I have played all the total war games and fing myself returning to this one very often due to the extensive gameplay features they have in the game. Those complaining about family tree and political system don't understand it and deserve the hassel that brings. The game adds these elements to bring depth and new challenges which I believe it does, since so many people are complaining about it. Mod's have fix the broken aspects of the game so if this is you first total war game I suggest you start with Medieval or Medieval 2 to get the feel of what this game is about. It's not starcraft, or civ, or like any game for that matter. You must manage an empire or a horde if that's your style, with that comes responsibility and reprocussions for every decision. EXAMPLE

I was playing as the saxon's who are pagen in nature, I start out by taking out all the other pagen tribes within a few years, being that they are also pagen, the people don't object to my rule for long.  Next comes rome, a christian empire with many gods that the people worship. Now here's where the game gest tough. I take over some roman settlements and the people are furious (with good reason) our religions are completely differen! This causes alot of trouble for some gamers in that they just want to kill and dominate with out taking this into account. The settlement revolts and you starts to lose gold investing in settlement reconsruction and shrine building because when you take over a settlement that is a different religion you must replace their technology with your which can be expenisve and time consuming. You can help this transition with priest, they will help indoctrinate the population to your ways. All while this is happening your comanders have been campaingning succesfully and gain popularity within the population which undermines the kings rule, this can't stand and you must take politcal action againt these generals or outside families. This is where the negative reviews come in because that's usually when you start to get frustrated and quit. So if you want a game where you can unrealisticly conqer europe, this isn't your game.

19,20071438,english,"This game is terrible. I should have known better. It's been all down hill since medieval 2. It can be redeemed by a number of fantastic community mods to a level that is playable, but having to do this with terrible CA game after terrible CA game becomes increasingly inexcusable with each iteration.

If you want to underestand why this game is so disappointing, listen to Dan Carlin's ""Wrath of the Khans"", which was about the mongols but it's pretty much the same, and you will come away with a complete understanding of just how bad this game is at portraying what the huns or mongols were actually like. I sure wish the developers did so, it could have been a really fantastic game. The blatant absence of any connection to history makes it all the more clear what this game intends to be, a way to squeeze money out of people using rome 2, a disaster in its own right, as a base.

The idea of basing a total war game on the huns or mongols - a nomadic people whose way of life revolved around the horse and war is extremely intrigueing. Living off the land and pillaging was their way of life. They could conquer nations much greater than themselves because of the power of the horse and the bow and what these tools allowed them to achieve tactically and strategically.

The reality is, you can't do the strategic things because the concept of the huns was shoehorned into the framework of a total war game. Your units have upkeep, just like any other faction. The only payment these troops received historically was a share of the plunder when towns were sacked.

As Carlin points out, the steppe peoples' favorite tactic was ambushing. Guess what? The huns can't ambush in this game.

As Carlin also points out, the fact that the entire army moved at the speed of a horse because it had no logistics (nor was it attached to its yurt ""city"" as it is in this game) meant these armies could move 2-3 times faster and further than a conventional army in the same amount of time. In this game, I'm not even sure a 100% cavalry army gets any more movement points than an army with infantry and seige weapons, let alone 2-3 times as many as would be appropriate.

You have infantry as the huns, and pretty much have to use it due to rock-paper-scissors mechanics (foot archers and spearmen both crush cavalry/cav archers in total war), which is historically inaccurate.

The huns' cavalry is like all other cavalry in rome 2, borderline useless.This is also completely historically inaccurate. I had a single bodyguard unit surrounded by 5 units of hunnish melee cavalry (basically time in real life to choose falling on your sword to dying at their hands) and the bodyguard defeated them.

I moved an army, consisting entirely of cavalry, as actual hun armies would have, into a province and was attacked by an army consisting almost entirely of infantry and could not withdraw from battle. The tactic of harassing and withdrawing is historically how the steppe peoples were able to defeat armies many times larger than themselves, except you can't do it in this game. I was forced to fight an army I could easily have evaded if any attempt was made to be true to history.

In spite of all this, there is a way to enjoy this game. The solution is to install a wide variety of mods that can fix some of this. There is an archers reload ammunition mod, which allows you to harass and retreat within a battle with archers (Carlin says the Mongols had about 150 arrows per man when they rode into battle, the hunnic horse archers have about 20). There is a mod that fixes relationships with client states so they don't rebel (huns can't hold territory, so client states are essential). There is a mod that prevents the cheating AI from recruiting agents and spamming them at you, as it has done since medieval 2 (I was spammed with a 10 star enemy spy by the year 400 in my current play through.) There are a few other mods, including 12 turns per year, increasing base fertility by 1, reducing costs of diplomacy, increasing the importance of generals that are also very helpful.",1451403061,1452056703,False,1,0,0.459152191877365112,0,True,False,False,76561197965789416,147,28,3211,0,2082,1473804224,,

For example, the Hoards are simply moving from point to point stealing, razing, killing other factions to get enough food and funding to spend developing your mobile settlements. 

The Western Roman Empire, for example, starts owning the entire Western Europe, Southern Britain and Northern Africa. With very few armies at your disposal and wanning public order, you have to make the decision of which provinces to abandon and where to position your forces before they get flanked. The objective the game gives you is to simply survive until a set date. You are constantly pressured by the Celts, Saxons, Vikings, and even former vassal factions. 

The palpable sense of dread as your faction is get torn apart or the feeling of satisfaction as you're doing the tearing is fantastic in this game. Obviously there's plenty of bugs as is the case with all Total War games. With the large scope of this game it's impossible to expect something bug-free, similar to how Bethesda games always have been and always will be bug-friendly.

The AI in ATW, as in R2TW, is absolutely awful and continues to rely on varying degrees of cheats/handicaps to give the impression of a challenge. This is no longer acceptable; AI should have historically and situationally based strategic and operational objectives at this point in the series, unlike the wildly chaotic (and historically/strategically ludicrous) and nonsensical AI on display in this game. A good example of this is the tendency of hordes to commit faction suicide in senseless attacks. Crappy battle AI is still a factor, with AI units sometimes continually exchanging places (re: milling in confusion) or standing still next to a wall while getting machinegunned by archers. If anything the focus of graphics over substance is indicative of the CoD approach that Sega/CA are adopting post-Shogun. The lack of significant AI improvements is pathetic. I have tried many, many mods and put in a lot of hours in the hopes of this game being a worthwhile addition to the series, but nothing can repair this level of deficit.

It may not be absolutely historically accurate in some respects, but if that kills the game for you, I'd suggest you either take that bur out of your ass or find a new hobby.

I actually think the culture packs are a lot of fun (still, wait until they go on sale). As far as unit diversity, most units belonging to different factions within a certain culture are indeed similar, but these are essentially cookie-cutter units required to keep the game balanced and fun. There are still many unique units to play with. And I found the different faction traits to be highly diverse and rewarding towards very different playstyles. As for the campaign packs, I wouldn't say I have buyer's remorse, but I could've done without them. I thought they were pretty lacking, some more than others. I played AoC for like a day and couldn't wait to go back to the Grand Campaign. Just one guy's opinion.

44,20186353,english,"This is a superb entry in the Total War series. The foreboding and depressing atmosphere is completely engrossing and the visuals are remarkable. The introduction of sanitation and the expansion of food mechanics adds a great deal more thought to empire building on the campaign map. Most previous entries were bare bones in this regard, where you just built the newer building because it was better. Speaking of the campaign map, there is a lot more to do than just occupying cities. Most factions in the game don't need to form a massive empire to win. Instead, they are given objectives such as gaining a certain amount of money from sacking and raiding. Factions can enter horde mode and roam around the map pillaging as they go while the Huns burn everything in sight. The two Roman Empires already start the campaign huge and need to fight a desperate battle to survive. This adds a great deal more variety in faction playstyles than has been in previous games. Tactical battles are also excellent, among the best in the series.

The AI is solid overall, though still not perfect. It performs well in tactical battles and can be a challenge on the campaign map as well. My one major complaint is that it seems reluctant to attack a walled city if you have a garrison inside it, meaning that you never get to fight defensive battles in large walled cities. You can easily abuse this shortcoming of the AI to create ""no go"" zones to keep enemies, particularly the Huns, from reaching important parts of your empire.

67,20105278,english,"With each Total War game they seem to make little small improvements that make it harder to revisit the older games without the improvements.  Attila offers several improvements on Rome 2:
* You can choose to play as a city state or as a Horde that lives out of tents.  Playing as a Horde presents a totally unique gaming experience.
* The ability decimate entire regions.  Taken a city that you wont be able to hold?  Dont just abandon it.  Burn the city to the ground, set fire to the land and salt the earth so the region is nothing but a barren wasteland to anyone else for years.
* The ability to combine land and naval battles.  I think you could do this in Rome 2 but in Attila it is actually effective.  When you land troops the boats withdraw so you can land multiple ships on the one landing spot.  Ships with ballistas hammering the defenders from the sea while your catapults unleash hell on the land.  Marines taking advantage of your troops distracting defenders at the walls to land inside the city walls.
* The game does seem to run a lot smoother.  I had some frame rate issues with Rome 2 which are now gone.
* Optional family tree management.  You can technically ignore it but issueing family and retainer members with titles now gives extra bonuses.

Its a bit closer to Medieval with the reintroduction of Viking factions.  Playing the Huns feels a lot like playing the mongol/Tamurid factions from Medieval 2.

Pros
- Horde encampent mode is incredibly fun and the most interesting mechanic that CA has added in some time.
- There's tons of unit variance, and the infantry rosters of most factions are nifty, from axe units, to spears, to pikes, to swords, with more discernable differences than in Rome 2.
- The razing of settlements and watching the snow crawl further and further south with each passing winter is amazing.
- Celts and Vikings :D

Cons
- Probably my biggest gripe, with the introduction of squalor when in conjunction with unhappiness and food consumption, the game's province building system is starting to feel far more punishing than fun. Mods are highly recommended to soften the blow.
- Viking and Longbeards DLC suffer from Rome 2's DLC faults, barely adding in any unique units that aren't already in the game. 
- The AI still wears its pants on its head.
- Enemies clear on the otherside of the map will almost always refuse peace unless your personally go over there and beat the tar out of them.",1451334350,1451334350,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198004272520,310,3,12386,0,5198,1588471914,,

Although I still have yet to see much of the late game content due in part to my own incompetence and the fact that I find myself going back and deleting old saves to account for updates, DLC's, and now mods!

All in all I'd give this game a solid 7.5/10 (Previously 8, will explain) especially considering the price isn't even full retail. This is the Napoleon where Rome 2 is Empire, if Empire and Napoleon were both garbage (Yes, I liked Empire). I have decided to switch from recommending this game to not recommending this game because at this point, the problems seem to exceed the good things about the game. Again, may come back if things change.

The Good
- Solid graphical improvements
- Effects are wonderful, especially the new fire system
- Water in battles looks fantastic
- AI on both campaign and the battlefield has improved to almost Medieval 2 levels (AI in Shogun 2 was...iffy...)
- Family tree system adds depth almost unseen in TW and may remind users of Paradox's famous Crusader Kings series
- Much to the adulation of CA's irritating Turkish community, the Magyars are in!
- The advisor/narrator sounds vaguely like King Hrothgar or whatever from that Beowulf movie which is just cool
- Addition of religion system a la previous total war titles

The Bad
- Many of the same voice actors from Rome 2, TONS of recycled lines
- Some of the armor on units looks pretty ugly and bland, especially the Roman ones, which is a real shame (although this may be a testament to the fact that armor in and of itself was rather ugly and bland at the time)
- Water on the campaign map looks like someone poured blue dye into a glass of day old milk (fixed with mods)
- Culture has been replaced entirely by religion instead of being placed alongside it, same goes for the Dignitary culture agent being replaced by the Priest so you can't have a primarily Celtic settlement that follows Latin Christianity, etc.
- DLC whoring within months of release (B&G I understand is for ratings purposes and that is acceptable) (-0.5 off my rating for the game)
- Family/Politics system is arbitrary as hell at times, getting married is nigh impossible
- Can't convert to a new religion unless population is exactly 30% or higher of a given religion, making it excessively difficult for even neighbors of very strong religious empires to convert

The ugly
- Extreme Quality settings weren't meant for current GPU's, apparently
- Much of the battle/diplomacy dialogue is ripped directly from Rome 2 I'm not even kidding
- AI, while improved, cannot decide between being a ruthless enemy or a coward, so you will have an enemy who takes settlement after settlement, then turns tail and runs the second you buy a single mercenary unit more
- AI is ridiculously reluctant to trade even when you're full of resources and are practically giving them away for free, even when they like you a lot, factions with 100+ affinity for you will still reject trade offers, even when offered money as well
- AI is unnecessarily stubborn, refusing a peace treaty even when their settlements are burning
- Some of the kill animations are just really bizarre as they often don't account for what weapon a character is holding so you'll have stabbings with axes, beheadings with maces, etc.
- The decapitation animations are just sad to look at

93,19817553,english,"Just like Rome II, Attila is a great game for multiplayer battles.  Graphics are excellent.  Improvements as compared to Rome II include the following:
-Fire mechanics are impressive.
-Crossbows are introduced as well as axe infantry and neither of these are present in Rome II.  This adds more variety to the game.
-The game play is a little bit slower than Rome II, which is a good thing.  In Rome II the calvary charges came too fast and could deciminate archers before you have sufficient time to react.

The game is worse than Rome II in the following aspects:
-There are no banners for each faction.  This is really terrible.  All of the banners on your team look identical and the ones on the other team look identical (either blue or yellow).  This makes the game less visually appealing and makes it more diffcult to assess the battle you are facing.  Considering how easy it would be to fix this issue, it makes one wonder why they don't do it.
-The ""start battle"" glitch is still in the game, same as Rome II.
-There is a new glitch that was not present in Rome II.  In Rome II, to group and organize units all one must do is press G to group the units and then right click to drag the units into a line.  In Attila, you must first group the units and then you need to manually select the type of formation that is desired and finally you get to drag the line.  This is a bit more laborious and is not necessary because this system was perfectly designed in Rome II and all they did is mess it up.
-In Rome II the archers would shoot at the unit you select it to shoot at.

94,19943382,english,"If you only buy one total war game, then I would suggest Shogun 2, as I consider it a perfect game.

As for Attila, it´s more of a survial strategy game. You will guide your chosen faction through one of the most perilous times in european history, and wether your faction are a band of landless drifters or a grand and ancient empire, the odds WILL be stacked against you.

PROS:
* Pretty graphics, of course
*The world is incredibly vast, encompassing the brittish isles, scandinavia, europe, russia, down to african coast, and the middle east. and I have´nt even seen it all. Starting at one side of the world, there is no chance you will reach the other side in one game. 
*Nice and useful diplomatic system. You can forge alliances and broker peace using an arsenal of tools. Slaughtering or freeing your captives, offering gold, negotiating political marriage, supporting or betraying allies, all afffects your standing with various factions. A strong coalition can be just as strong as a single vast empire, but beware, no alliance lasts forever. Make sure you will be the one to come out on top. :)
*Combat is nice, though Shogun 2 might be slightly better. It may just be because I like Japanese units more. Managing exhaustion and morale is important to get the most out of your soldiers. Letting a unit rest for a moment will greatly increase their effectiveness. 
*Your experience will vary greatly depending on what faction you pick.

CONS:
*Lots of tiny DLC:s. Not a problem for me, since I love the franchise and do´nt mind sending a little tip their way. Lots of bad blood in the community because of it though.
*It´s never gonna be fair. The game is about fighting for your life, and to achieve that effect, the game will cheat. You will ask yourself where all those soldiers are comming from. If you have a problem with that, Shogun 2 is your game.

But I kind of disagree, as it has very improved machanics and has been greatly stabilised and the game machanics have greatly improved.

The Game also looks amazin, even though the game has a major problem with its FPS difference from the Rome II Total War, making the game almost unplayable, but I believe with future updates this problem will be fixed as they work on it

8,19890787,english,"After playing 76 hours, i am sorry to say that i did not enjoyed the game. The reason is that the game is poorly balanced, so, after few rounds and few battles you can make a large army (20 units). This actually leads to a situation in which how you move your army on the “strategy map” became much more critical than other aspects and, actually, the chances of finding a balanced and enjoyable battle are neglible. In either, few words, after few turns you find a small army that you can easily beat, or two armies, against you can do absolutely nothing.

In my cases, in different games, I have played three -four “moderately fun” battles at the beginning of the game (*), and after that in the next 40 turns I could not find any decent battle.

(*) Furthermore, at the beginning of the game you do not have good troops, so, the “tactics” that you could expect in a battle, is almost disappeared.

As I said, the main problem of this game is that it is based on the combination of two levels “the campaign map” and the “battle map”. However, the balance between those two levels has not been found neither on this game neither in previous ones, and the chances of enjoying a battle on the “battle map” decreases dramatically with increased playing time. This is actually a critical issue, since destroys the whole gameplay. 

I would also complain against the “quest” system (on the DLC), and the diversity of troops, but really does not deserve to speak about this with the previous issue.

As a final remark, I would really suggest the people to try Total war: Warhammer before playing, since if this issue continues probably will not deserve to be played.

78,19652072,english,"Okay I have purchased every TW game since the start and all the DLC's so you could say I am a junky when it comes to this game. Over the years there have been many highs and several cold turkeys especially just after release. Like every junky I cannot leave it alone and keep coming back (""it's okay I will just play a little and then stop) my stats show that this is not the case. So Attila love the way it looks, the strategy and intrigue, (most bugs have been fixed) hate the weather/food system and squalor mechanics.  What I do like is the fact that creative listen to some extent to the community and alters things after release, I also like the freedom that modders are given to alter the game, which negates the negative of the weather/food squalor mechanics.
This game is a lot harder than previous incarnations, I normally crank it up to the top and leave it there until I have completed it several times,  not in this case, it is a challenge depending on the faction you pick.
Anyway I was not surprised at the mixed rating but it is better than that clearly this reflect the early issues that some people had (for me the issue were minor even from the start).
The nomadic tribes  are cool and the Huns are amazing horse men, the Roman campaigns are very hard and challenging and you need to have strategic outlook to survive ( this may put some people off as Roman is no longer a super power in this game) and a mini ice age is coming  ( reduced food money etc).
Battles are epic and the AI has caught me a few times with epic out flanking manoeuvres, Sea battles are not so epic and are hard to manage with large fleets so I avoid them, but sea born invasion are cool and can be very satisfying.
All in all this is a good game if you like strategy games do not be put off by the mixed rating as this should not be thought of as a mediocre title, so I give it a thumbs up I hope you do too.

If you're NOT a big TW franchise fan then i suggest you play TWR2 instead as this game tends to bring much more of a challenge end game than there other titles which is why the Easy-Normal campaign players hate it haha.

0,19641832,english,"* I am not making any comments on the game's DLC policy that everybody seems to be butthurt about*

Total War: ATTILA is this game a lot of cats seem hella pumped for. And this game is sitting in my Steam Library for review so I'm like, yeah man, I'll write something. But I don't know. I'm like, this is about Huns or some noise? Thats fine, I'm sure thats like fuckin' dynamite in a handbag for some brosephs. But all I'm saying is when do you get to [i]thrash[/i] anything? Like when you're playing Emperor or some shit are you ever in jeprody of getting wine on your robes or barbarians busting out, and I quote ""the mad stunts and wicked up-ins""?

But anyways, on to the actual review. So Total War: Attila is a pretty solid game. Compared to Rome II, the game is quite a bit more challenging. Battles are much more dynamic with morale and fatigue being very fluid so this allows for decisive moments in a battle to bring you the cake. Ranged troops are still pretty good with javelin troops still being king, infantry are more or less the same though a bit more defensive in general, cavalry is also pretty much the same. Field artillery has been significantly changed, onagers still exist though they aren't anywhere near the balista of Rome II, most of them are more like the scorpions of its predecessor. I'm not to sold on the unit progression in Attila, rather than better units being recruitable from better baracks like in Rome II, units are upgraded with the 'retrain' button once a certain technology has been reached to unlock its upgrade. On one hand it ensures that the AI will have high quality armies, something of an issue in Rome II. On the other hand it means towards the late game everybody will be fielding armies of entirely elite troops wich just feels wrong.

The campaign map looks pretty nice compared to Rome II's. Armies have a new integrity feature, its a cool idea but pretty easy to manage so it might as well be not there. Politics are much more refined than in RII, but still pretty easy to manage with the minor exception of the two Roman factions simply because they have a metric fuckton of random politicians floating about. The Family tree is back and about as useful as it was in the previous games, which is to say not at all. Diplomacy is about the same, though factions really hate it if you have more than like 10 settlements because the 'Great Power' penalty is huge and Imperium is too easy to get, you will be at war pretty often if you get big. Food and money are both significant resources, oftentimes food becomes scarce preventing full delelopment in cities which I felt was nice. Religion is pretty cool, but it's more or less just a replacement for Rome II's culture system instead of an additional feature.The new Horde mechanics are kind of cool though not too different from being sedentary, the transistion from horde to sedantary is a little jarring though when it comes to wealth. The fertility drop events are nice in theory, but in practice it just leaves the game with virtually no fertile areas by the end which is just lame.

I probably missed a lot but whatever. Overall its a pretty solid game if you like strategy games. 8/10",1449882169,1449882169,True,2,0,0.461953401565551758,0,True,False,False,76561198014861044,218,10,4739,0,3609,1535079825,,

Total War: ATTILA is awesome and far superior to Rome Total War 2. It's beautiful, difficult (without crazy cheating like Shogun TW 2) and interesting with varied factions and interesting history and mechanics.

If you like the total war games, you'll enjoy it.

The reason it has got so many negative reviews is they now sell extra factions as DLC instead of allowing you to unlock them. Not cool, but there are plenty of varied factions in the initial release.

Rome 2 was very much the relax in the bath while listening to your favourite easy listening CD of choice for most seasoned Total War fans even on 'Legendary' settings......Battle line....hold......flank and oh wait they are running already and onto the next civilization to crush beneath your sandals. For me it became more of an Empire building strategy simulation which is all very relaxing.

Attila is very much more like slipping on a pair of boxing gloves and working out your pent up frustrations on a heavy bag at the end of a long stressful week. It is overwhelmingly unbalanced but that is not an oversight or mistake by the production team it is exactly how it is meant to be. Playing as any one of the European Tribes is very much a stroll in the park picking your opponents carefully and building up slowly.......you know the routine you have played Rome 2. 
 The Huns are just so much fun to play and having an entire army of horse archers; well you can see why the huns were so devastating to the enemy in real life and I wondered why the maps were so big too until I played as the huns. Its a bit like cowboys and indians with the old wagon trick but shields only face one way so with huns all around thats a lot of dead barbarians in the middle made to look like oversized pin cushions. 
 Then there are the Eastern Empires and things are so easy for them its like childs play and I honestly didnt play too long with them about 60 turns as I became bored; it was Rome 2 on Easy.
The real fun to this game is when playing as either the western or eastern half of the Roman Empire. I played first as the West and watched as 'MY' Empire and it felt like my empire having just come from Rome 2 was being destroyed by Raging treacherous barbarian scum and I fought one Valiant defeat after another watching my provinces slowly slip away from me and slowly plotting my revenge on every last one of them. (FYI the A.I when it plays as either west or east Rome is terrible) You are quite literally crippled by the province corruption that the west suffers and the huge penalty to happyness you get from immigration; it is very doom and gloom at the start and at first I was simply thinking playing as the Romans is just slow losing game but then you notice that the immigration actually gives you money and the smaller your empire shrinks the less corruption you have......more money. So retreating to the Italian peninsula I dug in and made my stand; playing out every impossible valiant defeat in real time and making the barbarian scum pay for every town taken in knee deep blood. When you have six troop cards against two barbarian armies, yes they usually send two whole armies against even villages, and you almost win it is so satisfying but when you actually get that Heroic Victory its a feeling of ""BRING IT ON M*****F******S!"" but then they do with two more fresh armies and whats left of your small garrison is massacred......which leads you back to the whole revenge plotting mentality again. 
So several turns in and Britain is well.....not under my control anymore put it that way....France....Belgium....Germany.....all gone....the East overrun just the Alps between the storm and my heartland which was now fortified but spain is slowly rebelling and the Afrikan tribes have just declared war upon me.....surely the Eastern Empire will aid me......my diplomat informs me they have broken off their alliance I am on my own.
From here on it just becomes a war of attrition and ruthless action against your foes; fast forward many more turns and the Afrikan tribes are subdued their territories mine as far as Egypt as the careless Eastern Empire let it rebel. Spain has all but been retaken and the Barbarians pushed back to Northern France; I breath a sigh of relief as things are finally starting to go my way when the Huns appear at the Passway into the Alps and my hearland. Its about now I regretted playing on Legendary and not having that save option......but its here that decided that game really for me anyway. Attila himself with six armies against my four with a ragtag mercenary army to boot as well. Epic doesnt really begin to describe the scope and sometimes desperation of the ensuing battles which were won sometimes down to the last legion. Many turns on......in fact sometime around 435 I believe......Britain is once again mine.....Europe in fact is under my dominion once more and Attila who wouldnt die no matter how many times my champion achieved a critical assisination attempt on him has been scattered to the wind; Babylon has fallen and the East kneels before me.......satisfaction like this you can as it turns out pay for.

Having read a lot of the negative reviews I am often baffled by how many people just do not understand the game mechanics; it all works as it should. 

To those of you who are having game performance issues......I have an AMD 7800 which is a good few years old now and the game runs on max settings mostly flawlessley.....I suggest you replace your mice powered grapics card and quit whining or play chess with a friend.

If you are complaining about the agents in this game then go play Rome 2 and come back to this you will soon stop complaining. I have had no issues and the agents are as they should be in the back ground of everything an amusing curiosity and not a game breaker like they could be in Rome 2

Fertility.......yes it goes down to reflect the population explosion....the cold....war.....the lack of fertile ground being farmed etc etc. It forces you to be smart and there are buildings to resolve all food shortages and wonders to help too.....if you are having a problem long term with food issues then you need help with your grand strategy or maybe go play chess its where the greats all started. Turn 435 1200+ food surplus no issues

Settlement razing........its the only way for the hun to exist.......if you cant cope with this then you really shouldnt play this game; it is expensive to repopulate as the romans but not so much as one of the migrating tribes....if you dont like devastated lands either play as a tribe or learn to fight like a roman legion and win

Not to harp on again about people not understanding the game but the whole imperium penalty and diplomacy penalty thing is spot on......playing as the eastern roman empire and having a -120 penalty with a tribe as they feel oppressed just made me laugh then kill that leader until one came along who was not feeling so oppressed and more admiring of strong empires....its all there but people just cant be bothered to play the game......and before someone asks how you kill another empires king.....well this is TOTAL WAR....so either corner him on the battlefield and butcher him like the dog he is or send out your champion with a very sharp pointy stick to drive home the issue with him.

The whole family tree is nice and balancing the whole power....control just adds another ball to juggle.......the traits were broken but fixed now i think.

Not sure why people are complaining about the rosters.......probably been playing Rome 2 with its millions of workshop add ons which im sure will come in time with ATTILA but there are more than enough units when you factor in all the ones you can levy from client states and friendly tribes wandering through your lands.....make peace with the huns and you can even have theirs too.

Everybody really complains about the add on pack rip off........but lets look at what they allow the modding community to do and thats all free from some very dedicated hard working individuals. Yes its a cash cow for CA&SEGA but compared to some other hobbies this one is very cheap in comparision for the hours back it gives you

28,19593716,english,"Total War: Attila! Or Total War: If you want some useless DLCs! I am joking and in this review I am going to focus on the multiplayer aspect. Now most people who play Total War multiplayer listen to Heir of Carthage or Prince of Macedon or recently, Blademaster and Maximus Decimus Meridius. That's fine, I see them myself. However, what they are telling you is only half the story. I submitted a battle replay to Heir of Carthage. Check out Attila Battle 44. When I finished seeing it, I was fuming. He spent almost half of the time trashing the game. I mean I didn't send it for him to trash the game but for him to commentate on it, what he does best at. Now to tell me why I like this game due to its multiplayer aspect. First of all for the roster spam, does anyone remember the levy freemen roster spam in Rome 2. Then they come in Attila and complain that there is noble germanic blah blah blah, germanic lancers, germanic archers. Yes, you are definitely right the spam is more common in Attila. However, keep in mind that it happened to a certain extent in Rome 2. Now for the cavalry complainers. I find it funny that people think that cavalry should be nerfed in Total War: ATTILA. ATTILA! I think I need to tell these reviewers that Huns were mainly cavalrymen. Then due to Heir of Carthage's horrible misunderstanding of the game, let me explain some more things. Any infantry in sheildwall beats any Dane Axe or Khanda wielding unit. Germanic Archers have a great range, but horrible reload speed. In that time, you can close the distance with your slingers. Then people say skirmishers don't have any value in the game. True, up to a certain extent. If skirmishers were OP as they were in Rome 2, then 70% of the units are gone. Huscarls, Godansmen, Uars, Spice Guard...Remember the Cavalry...Saxon Lancers, Germanic Lancers,Frankish Lancers. Then people comlain that the Sassanids aren't overpowered in multiplayer. Remember that the Sassanids are still pretty powerful....their cataphracts and their Dailamites aren't to be underestimated...however you are right but it all makes perfect sense. Think about Parthia in Rome 2. With that in mind, The Sassanids were the most richest and powerful states in the East if not the whole world. They should be very powerful at ultra funds settings, which they certainly are. Now to wrap this rambling up:

Pro's and Con's to Total War: Attila Multiplayer Experience

Pro's:
Balancing-Which never happened in Rome 2, because no one picked Pergamon because of its horrible roster. In Attila everyone picks every faction. 

Fun Factions

Graphics

Animations

Fun Tactics- The same tactic can be used by every faction in Rome 2

Cons:

DLCs: Stop with DLCs! I mean this is what angers me about TW: Attila. There are so many. Now granted if you guys play Total War, I am pretty sure you know about Europa Universalis 4. Whats wrong with these DLCs is that they just change the name of a faction add one or two more units and substract some as well. There you go it is a DLC. Although the Celts DLC was appropriate. You got some fun guerilla action in it as well as some cool units. Some of others weren't as good, but most of them were specifcally geared towards campaign which I don't care about. 

Roster Spam: Hear of the Aesop Fable about the Fox and His Grapes. I think it will be helpful.

29,19591419,english,"I don't usually review games, but Attila is a game that I really enjoy and is also a game that has garnered a lot of hate from the Total War community, so I thought I'd give my thoughts on it. This review doesn't deal all that much with the gameplay aspects, although I will touch on that, but is more a defense of the game in general.
Firstly, I'm pretty new to Total War. Shogun II was my first Total War, but I kind of just dicked around in it for awhile and never actually learned much. Attila was the first Total War I really sunk my teeth into, and has since become one of my favorite games. The only reason I include this is to let the readers know that I don't have a long relationship with the Total War franchise and this was pretty much the first one I really spent time playing. 
Attila is not without its flaws, I'll admit that. However I think people are harder on it than need be. A lot of the negative reviews don't even address the gameplay, they are simply some half-assed protest of DLC. I don't like DLC either, but I don't see it as being that bad in this game. There are quite a few factions to play without the DLC and there is a fair amount of variety between the given factions. Too quickly players forget that Medieval 2 only had like four playable factions. Attila has four European horde factions alone. 
Coming to the gameplay, I have really enjoyed my time in Attila. It's a solid game with a breadth of fantastic strategy features. The family tree, building management, tech tree, and military strategy all come together to create a complex and entertaining experience. The battles are a ton of fun and the seiges can be epic as all hell. I think it's definitely worth checking out of you're a fan of strategy, especially with the Age of Charlemagne expansion coming up just around the corner.",1449703035,1449703035,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198042884702,189,6,6400,0,3447,1573892210,,

It is, however, still a grind. A campaign easily takes 100 hours to complete, many of which will be spend on micromanaging hopeless sieges against your smaller cities that you will have to do manually. There is an autoresolve which typically will cause less than 5% casualties to the enemy, while you may achieve 40-100% easily fighting the battle yourself. When you are fighting a scorched-earth war, as you'll often have to do as a non-horde faction in Attila, then autoresolve is rarely useful in the early to middle game.

Basically, this game is Rome II with its shit together.

It returns features like the family tree, dynamic skill and tech trees, and a more dynamic political system, while keeping successful features from Rome II like Army Traditions. All in all, if you're thinking about getting Rome II, get this game instead. It's cheaper, set in a similar time period, and has all the features that makes Total War great that Rome didn't have.

The Bad (Cons):
-Sometime in this game, you will expirence a crash, especially when you are ending your turn. (in campaign) Hopefully they will patch that.
-Optimization issues; My computer may be bad, but I know for sure that this game has some optimization issue's. Like FPS dropping for no reason once so ever. Its pretty bad.
-AI's sometimes use cheats; now, not the mods that gives you cheats, literally the AI uses cheats. Now there is a mod that fixes that, so not a big deal. You can leave it if you want a challenge.
-The DLC's; now, the DLC's arent that bad, but paying for blood and gore? I say, thats a cash grab right there. This game is FOR blood and gore. By the way, 2 bucks for blood and gore is honestly just stupid.

The Good. (Pros)
-The AI is alot better then Rome 2; now I didnt buy Rome 2, neither have I EVER played the game, but from the gameplay and such, I already know that Rome 2 AI's are bad.
-Game is addicting; now I know other Total War games are addicting, but trust me, this game is one of the most addicting games I have ever played. Its so addicting, its like cocaine, I swear to god.
-Challenging AI's; the Huns (from campaign) are really a challenge. They are hard to defeat, and the sieges are hard too, with their archers shooting at your men while your trying to get your siege equipments up on the wall and such is a big challenge. Unless you are very expirenced with sieging in Total war, then nevermind.

Now, would you buy this game? Honestly, thats up to you, but if you would have to ask me, I would say TOTALly.

63,19428143,english,"Overall a good game, this is my first total war game since Napoleon and a lot has changed, most of it for the better!

there is  a TL:DR at the end

[b]Campaign[/b]

The campaign is much more in depth and I appreciate the extra complexity in faction and unit management. Now you can control your court and help maintain the balance of power, it is not as complicated as other games but in TW I don't think this matters too much. I really like the food supply and the trading. I like the diplomacy more, now in negotiations you can see why they either like or dislike you, and you can manipulate this to your advantage, but sometimes it can be a bit random.

You can recruit generals, which is a really nice feature, I remember in other total war games the chronic general shortage. You can appoint Governors who are province wide and are not the same as Generals, no more ai auto-manage. I also like the Province system, settlements are organised into provinces, all settlements in a province can be controlled from one screen simultaneously, settlements in a province share things like food, public order and recruitment.

Public order is much better. It is on a scale from +100/-100. When it hits -100 you have a rebellion. Much more predictable and controllable than with previous public order which often seemed completely random. There are other features too like corruption which I like.

Armies crossing the sea, a nice feature now it that armies can cross the sea without having to faff about building and moving a navy to a certain position, you just right click and your army goes in boats by themselves. HOWEVER it does feel this feature is overused, for some factions it does seem a bit stupid. For Saxons, Danes, Jutes.. i.e. raiders I guess it makes sense, but for WRE... not so much. 

Raiding settlements, at least there are a lot of game mechanics for it. However as there are only 3 settlements (or so) per province, and no minor villages to raid a settlement you basically need an army, and once you have an army you may as well conquer the place. This feature could have been nice if they'd thrown a few fishing villages and things in, like the farms or towns in Napoleon, but there aren't any, so raiding is a bit pointless. Because of this Britain falls within the first 3 turns... so no more raiding :( .

Religious differences now have much less effect on the campaign than in Barbarian Invasion, I am a bit lukewarm about this change. It does make it a bit too easy just to steamroll whole regions and not really incur many religious/cultural penalties. I remember in Barbarian Invasion I thought it would be fun to see what converting your religion was on turn 1 would do, constant rebellion, uprisings and circa 2 million denari (thank goodness for cheats) later and I had gone from Pagan to Christian. But now if your Germanic Pagans conquer Latin Christians, there don't seem to really be any penalties, this is further made piss easy by Stonehenge which limits religious problems by 20%.

They have gone for the newer historiography when it comes to fall of Rome, and gone for corruption/food shortage/migratory crisis narrative, I like this change and it is well represented in game.

Compared to the 'original' (Rome: Barbarian Invasion) I think it is an overall improvement. Much more in depth, much more historically accurate (in the way the campaign mechanics work, food, 'invasion' more migration than war). The campaign is much more interesting and engaging  (although this may be because I have decided to fight every battle on map to prevent full stack armies being defeated by 1/4 stack enemies...)

[b]Battles[/b] (Campaign)

The battles are quite good, however there are some unit collission issues still, when a mass of infantry is engaged you do sort of end up with a soup, shield walls do not actually form shield walls (they have gaps), and they fight 1v1, so a lone enemy in your  [strike]formation[/strike]  soup could still take ages to die. The controls are like any of TW game. General skills are nice, however they are a bit tanky verging on OP.

Pikemen are completely OP, hmm I see you have a top level legionary unit... well I have tier 1 pikemen so f*** you.

The auto-resolve feature can sometimes be completely stupid, I wouldn't really recommend using it unless the odds are at least 75% in your favour, or crazy things can happen.

[b]Atmosphere[/b]

The music and visuals of this game are very good, many times it does feel bleak which is very appropriate. They seem to have upped their game on the music front too, it is now much more atmospheric, you can really imagine your Empire is crumbline around you, or that you are a newly established kingdom trying to assert its dominance in a turbulent world. The original Rome had the best music, but I feel that this soundtrack for this game was the best choice. 


[b]Factions, wait what factions?[/b]

Its all DLC, its utterly ridiculous. They literally ripped at least 1/2 of the factions out the game to sell back at you, and this isn't a cheap game, although I got it on sale, I am not paying for them, I am not getting them, I recommend you have the same attitude or they'll keep doing this s**t. 

The factions which there are, are quite good, there does seem to be more diversity when compared to previous titles, however there are not many unique buildings, structures or units inside of a cultural group between factions. Some units such as giving barbarians Roman style ships is a really dumb move, don't remove the diversity we have!

Do you remember Rome 1, where every time you defeated a faction you could play as it. Or if you wanted to cheat you could move a faction to the playable section in the game files ;) . Or like in Medieval 2 where you'd play as the Pope for lols by using the same method. Well now you have to pay, and it sucks.


The only DLC I am considering getting is Charlemagne, because it has a whole new campaign, factions ect. (you know, like an actual DLC should be). 

I would also like a 'Saxon Shore' DLC, because the raiding and invasion of Britain  is not really well represented, within about 3 turns you can own all of it... It would be nice to have a tight focussed campaign.

[b]Glitches/Crashes/Technical Issues[/b]

I have encounted only one crash so far, apart from that it has been plain sailing.
game can be a bit resource demanding, I would have liked a simplified campaign map.


[b]Conclusion[/b]

I would recommend buying, however it is important to acknowledge the game has flaws, however they are not nearly as bad as the problems other titles had and still have in some cases (Empire, Rome II). Everything seems pretty decent so [b]7/10[/b].

To be frank, Attila is a great TW game. It all comes down to what you want to compare it to.
To me it is a clear single player upgrade to Rome 2. They have refined everything, and built upon what worked in Rome 2.
They have been keeping up with the weird tradition of adding DLC factions in small quantities. What would help them actually motivate this is if they kept on updating and patching the older DLC factions as well. It royally pissed me off that they started adding faction quest lines with additional content to the newer DLC factions, but ignored the first ones and just let them be. There is such a thing as bad DLCs at the moment.
From a MP standpoint the game is more stable than Rome 2, but from an online combat standpoint it's a bit disappointing. The maps are really detailed and a clear upgrade from any TW game before. But the unit balance is very icky at the moment. This is barely noticable in the SP experience though.

Price / dlc and reletaed criticism
Unfortunately sega have decided to include often quite expensive dlc in their strategy games however for me its not something that should put anyone off buying it. The base game offers more than enough content to justify the sale price and the dlc is decent value when bought on sale. Don't worry on this too much even you are undecided, I play without any dlc and the game never compels you to buy it. 

AI
Sega have steadily improved their AI with each new game in the series, even if some required a lot of patching ( maybe not you Empire ) Attila is a gradual improvement from rome 2 emporer edition. For anyone who hasn't experienced the AI before it works well the vast majority of the time. Its the 1/10 occassions were the it does something really stupid that still detracts from the experience somewhat. Maybe 1/100 it actually does something smart but the main thing is that it presents a realisitc opponent.

Bugs, performance and stablilty
I experieinced very few gliches while playing. Apart from some rare pathfinding issues I had no major problems. I had one crash in over 10 hours of gameplay and the save remained fine. Performance was the weakist link for me. Playing with a gtx 660 and i5 3570 k processor, I experienced framerates <20 in campaign map. Optimising the graphics to the quality preset and reducing unit scales to medium fixed this issue however. Battle performance remained fine with large unit scale.

Is it fun?
If you enjoyed previous total war games than the answer is of course! The new systems, some from the original BI, add much needed depth and complexity. Every decision you make in the campaign map is just that, rather than a tedious process. You spend time thinking about where to best position your army or assessing the trade offs from different buildings and not mindlessly setting up constuction qeues. 
If you haven't played total war I recommend picking either this or rome 2 when on sale and trying it out. Alternatively try the older rome of medieval 2 games if you don't mind the graphics and increase in AI ""quirks""

If you want a good strategy game and you are new to the series get any of the games from before Rome 2. When they announced the new Rome I was so excited, the first Rome was one of my favourite games and I had spent an uncountable number of hours on it. But when I played this new game I knew I had been let down, not only because it was buggy like hell after release, but also because it just wasn't a good game anymore. I don't know how the developers are doing but it seemed as if their budget had been massively cut or they didn't really realise what had made the original games so good:
1) A campaign that was just as fun as battles. This meant that you could either play manually every battle or if you didn't feel like it you could just focus on the overall strategy part. Which leads onto:
2) A quickbattle system that actually worked. It didn't matter if you had fewer units or smaller armies, because if you had better troops then you could easily win against a massive frey of Gauls
3) Basically 2 again but pointing out that it didn't matter in battles either, I could understand from an historical point of view that numbers would matter when two barbarian kingdoms were settling differences, but you only have to look at Roman history for two seconds to realise that extremely small numbers could defeat an overwhelming force with the proper training and equipment.
4) What the fuck even happened to the campaign map!?!? In Rome 1 you had major players, there weren't many smaller nations and it all seemed to balance quite well. And they had some substance to them: the romans had good offensive quality troops, the northern barbarians had numbers on their side (and the odd cheeky chariot), the greeks had defensive quality, the eastern empires had excellent horsemen and quantity for their infantry and the remnents of alexander the great's macedonian empire had a similar feel to the greeks, but slightly leaning towards quantity. These were all hitorically acurate and also seemed to balance to each other, now theve just chucked a nation into each city and said: ""There...I'm sure that'll work"". I think its good that they've done a bit of research into nations at the time and then patted themselves on the back but its lost the game of all its substance.
5) Its basically Rome Total War: Barbarian Invasion which was basically just a DLC Rome 1 which felt like a mod, although it was better than this game.
6) Many more reasons that I can't be bothered to go into because this review was originally going to read: 'I prefered the first Rome'.

19,19255193,english,"Laziest game ever created. Utterly pathetic. You're playing againt idiotic AI whose only concern is burning settlements to the ground, no rival empires to do battle with, no AI expanded against the map to compete with, just AIs burning down settlements to make a quick 600 gold.

Reasons this game is NOT WORTH your money:

1. Horride AI
2. DLC simulation 2015. You have to pay more money for a ""blood & gore"" DLC pack. That's right, you have to PAY MORE for units to die realistically on the battlefield.
3. Shit range of factions to select from. So many of them have idiotic faction traits that make it impossible to build an empire with. Several factions that start as migrating hordes recieve moronic religious penetalies. The Visigoths start in Greece, I marched them down to Egypt where I stared my empire. I was receiving a -40, YES A -40 penality for religious differences. Fucking stupendeous.
4. Very little faction variation. If you buy a DLC, the units arent different, they're just in a different starting area with a different faction name, basically same units.
5. Some factions arent allowed the basic top tier units? Half of the playable factions cannot build large artillery pieces? Shouldn't all factions be allowed artillery?
6. WINTER. I completely understand historical accuracy and wanting to make the game resemble the actual timeline. But holy christ, snow will become your arch nemesis. I probably lost more men to fucking snow than actual battles. Even if you're taking a stroll through your territory with max upgraded/improved roads, you'll lose a decent chunk of your army. It's not regular snow attrition, its snow attrition on steroids. Once you start getting into the game, the winter season gets more and more brutal. Soon snow lasts through fall-spring in some areas, so you can only move without attrition in summer. GG.
7. Not at your pace. You're basically on a timetable. You get a mission update every 20ish years. Maybe I just wanna do what I want the whole time? Did you consider that?
8. Simply uncomprensible terms of victory. I CONQUERED THE ENTIRE MAP AND I DIDNT WIN THE GAME. The terms of victory are laughable. You have to do all these pointless and mondane tasks to win the game. I conquered the entire map with the Sassanids. I rebuilt every single town that was burnt down by retard AIs, and I didnt win the campaign. Are you kidding/

25,19207938,english,"Ive really changed my mind about this game, I think it is a pretty good game. 

Pros: colonization is actually really fun (for me) if you have the money to spend to reclaim a city, its a perfect way to expand without large wars, which is very helpful for the more dificult civs. In that case, you can just hold out and survive until the huns or some other civ burns everything down and then just take it all. Its like a buffet really, since computers rarely reclaim land.
Graphics- my god... i thought it couldnt get any more detailed than Rome2, but it turns out it can... 
Battles- they are just fantastic, and its very hard to explain just how amazing the battles actually are
VIKINGS!- MAN are the Geats ever fun, even with a crazy start location, they are easily my favorite civ in the game
Diversity in units- while it may take some time to get really good units (or just good enough to actually combat Roman forces) there are quite a few to choose from, though i do wonder why the Romans (and other civs) dont get traditional ballistae 

Cons- ok i know i am going to say too much, but i will try to keep it short and also say that the game is still great overall, these are just some little things i didnt care for
Seiges- ok lets be honest, this went a little overboard, taking 20 turns before the defenders would even run out of supplies and start to die off, this may be a bit more realistic than other Total War games, but it pretty much makes it so you just get some siege engines then you have to attack exactly the same force...
Food- well... the fall harvest bonus is useless, lets face it... it only lasts that one turn each year so how is it really helping... if anything it tricks you... also the changes throughout the turns, the ""climate change"" is awful, and it affects you HARD no matter who you are, even if you have the richest farmland on earth it turns to nothing...
Rome- there is pretty much nothing good that i can say about Rome... they are impossible to play as and almost as impossible to play against... Byzantines can be fun, in fact i destroyed one of the nomad civs within 2 turns of starting the game... but in the long run, they make it just a little too hard.

Upon release of the game, we are excited about the changes, improved game play, etc...
We spend HOURS on multi-player campaigns, buy every add on (which we thought gouged on with Attila).
When the game really starts to get intense, our empires built, my thoughts are consumed with my strategies, plots against my friends empire, etc...
Then the game gets caught in a series of never-ending crashes. 
EVERY SINGLE TOTAL WAR GAME HAS DONE THIS TO US. 
Each new game we promise each other the problems have been fixed. Every patch release has us crossing our fingers.

here is the review

Overall 9/10 I love this era of history so a peronal point there. But its good overall and its playable, its not very diverse when it comes to units [Nordic Levy and germanic levy.... my god] but the new horde mechanic is nice.
 
Graphics 8/10 slight changes from rome 2 with a gritty look

Gameplay 9/10 playing as a horde is my favorite part and the family tree is great but could be better with a little more customization

UI 7/10 I like the unit cards and the placement of everything, there is more of the screen that can be seen which is great. but there`s some little tweaks that a few mods fix 

AI 6/10 Its good but not its greatest strength it just depends on what difficulty your on like on legendary is VERY difficult but on normal its WAY to easy if you want to be challenged play on hard or up.

sound 7/10 Reusing the same sound files in the same place is ok but dissapointing [like some of the units voices are the same.... really]. The music is nice though I really like the musical sound track as compared to Rome 2.


I would also like to say dont write a bad review just because of dlc release or because you didnt like Rome 2, dont say it sucks because of lack of the blood and gore they couldnt get consumers in some countries if they did add it on release, and dont say its bad if you only have 2 hours of gameplay thats not enough for a good feel of the game mechanics.",1425267244,1446860076,True,0,0,0.499991804361343384,0,True,False,False,76561198082844973,172,5,16819,25,5276.0,1601221950,,

First off; I DO RECOMMEND THIS GAME, if you do not already own Total war; Rome 2.
If you already got that game, i strongly reccomend not buying this one as well.

Here's why; 
1. its pretty much the same campaign map as Rome 2. (Provinces, cities etc are in the same locations, same names)
2. it continues were rome 2 stopped, so its pretty much the same period of time. this means, almost the same units, architecture, siege engines, cities, building types, army/general/research system.
3. all in all it should have been an expantion pack to rome 2 as Fall of the samurai was to Shogun 2.
 Fall of the samurai expantion brought more new content to the game actually than Atilla would have added to Rome 2, should it have been an expantion.
4. naval battles still... not so great.

In my opinion (even as a total war fan) i do not think Atilla brings enough new content to be worth full price.

Whats new in Atilla (versus rome 2)
-the ability to completely raze settelments - next to occupy, loot, or subjugate/liberate

-Family tree in the politics tab. altho it does not have a big impact on the game or gameplay, its interesting to see your '' family line'' and to try and make sure it does not end timely.

-together with the option to raze settlements, you can also chose to start a new settlement in a province that has been razed. ( so no, you cannot chose to just start a village somewere on the map, only rebuild a destroyed one. so, why would you destroy it in the first place lol? )

-You can become a horde, and abandon all your settlements, and owned territory. Migrate to an abandoned or razed piece of land elsewere. this also means you dont lose when you lost all your settlements, so long as you still have an army fielded.

-Sanitation: Next to food surplus, and population happyness, you also have to keep an eye on the sanitation of a town. if the squalor (pollution) exeeds the sanitation, you have an increasing chance of decease outbreaks in your settlements.
Food stores, Wells, and bathouses are examples of buildings that affect this.

- a few new units, altho alot of them are almost the same as Rome 2 units.

END CONCLUSION:
- I would rate this game 8,5 on its own. its a good game, looks pretty, great gameplay, Nothing bad to say about the game on its own. I would reccomend it to people that do not have Rome 2 .

- If you do have Rome 2, this game adds little more. And i'd say its not worth buying a completely new game at full price for just a few more options and pixels in a game thats 85% the same.",1446503799,1446504062,False,3,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False,76561198011749525,33,16,11619,0,1687.0,1576018047,,

84,18719123,english,"The Prologue campaign in this game is brutal! It's like a Demon's Souls tutorial that is designed to kick your ass. I restarted it once before realizing that it was designed for the player to fail in order to teach the new migration feature. This prologue acts as a tutorial for the new features and mechanics of the game, but it doesn't do a particularly good job of teaching these mechanics. It also doesn't go into much detail of the established features of the franchise (other than telling you that a feature exists, then making you click on the button to do it), so new players might find themselves completely turned off by the fact that they are having their asses handed to them and aren't being taught much about how the game actually works, or - more importantly - why they are failing so hard.

The horde mechanics and time period of Attila actually helps to add a lot of variety in the different factions available in the campaign. A couple factions (like the Saxons and Franks) start with the traditional Total War setup of having one territory and having to conquer more. But the new horde tribes such as the Huns, Goths, Visigoths, Vandals, and so on don't start with any territory and have to migrate across the map, sacking and raiding and pillaging as they go. I think it was a bit unfortunate that the Hun armies on the campaign map are still represented by a soldier walking around and fighting with a sword, rather than someone fighting from horseback.

And then there's the Western and Eastern Roman Empires, which both start with large chunks of territories. The player takes over these large empires as they are on the verge of collapse and has to face off numerous challenges and threats from all different angles. And if you want an easier empire-management campaign, there's even the middle-eastern Sassanid Empire that starts with a large swath of land, numerous client states, and easy-to-defend borders.

This lead to me being much more excited to try out different factions and even play multiple campaigns in parallel in order to try out the various challenges of each faction's starting conditions. The different conditions of the various factions also brings about different playstyles that means that different factions can appeal to different players. Players who want constant war and conflict can play as the Huns or Germanic tribes; whereas, players who are more interested in building an empire and managing diplomacy and economies will likely be more interested in the Romans or Sassanids.

The Political System is a Point in the Game what i like you have more Options make a Alliance or make a Statment for a War or be Neutral and wait^^ the one think what i not like is the voices it has zero variations in there voices and in the long run you skip it over badly =/. Without the Workshop its a good Game but after a while you play more and hours later or days later its just a little bit the air out. With the Workshop you have so many new Option to enjoy this good Game even more just as before the normal Game and also makes these Modders a very good mods that they makes for us. I can really recommend Total War Attila also to the Persons they not familiar with the Series like me ;)
The only thing that bothers me, in principle, that Rome goes really fast down and the Huns largely dominated the Game^^ but also for that there are mods with or without it's fun to paly (Y). 
This is my very first review i hope it's not so bad written by and sry for my english =>

Pro
Nice Prologue.
Single Player Campaign.
Multiplayer Campaign with friends a lot of fun.
Workshop.
Beautiful Graphics and Atmosphere.
DLCs ​​(Yes, it is always very controversial but who do not like it does not have to buy it ;))
Turn-Based Game
Combat System Scissors Stone Paper principle

Contra
Variations of the Voices.
Strong Huns with there siege equipment which in my opinion are too strong with countless stacks.
KI (They is not able to capture the city during the siege and sacks only.)
Poor optimization of the Game.
Few Factions in the Main Game available only with the DLCs are exciting.
Weak Bows Units no harm except the crossbow.

On the whole, a really great and enjoyable Game that can be purchased at the full price without having to consider =)

Mein erstes Total War Spiel der Reihe überhaupt, ich muss sagen es gefällt mir immer noch auch nach 300h+ Spielzeit. Am Anfang war ich sehr begeistert klar ist warscheinlich bei jedem so wen was neu ist^^ ich habe mich dann direkt für die Nordmänner entschieden (Jüten) der Anführer und die ganze Familie sind echt cool und es war eine riesige Freude nach und nach mit meiner Fraktion Bündnisse oder Kriegserklärungen zu schmieden die Dörfer auszubauen und die Armee aufzubauen, erobern etc. etc.. Das Politische System gefällt mir auch gut nur ich hätte mir mehr Variationen in der Stimme gewünscht das nicht jeder die gleiche Stimme hat auf Dauer wirkts einfalls los. Ohne den Workshop bleibt es ein gutes Spiel nach ner weile aber nimmts die Spannung. Mit dem Workshop hat man viele neue Möglichkeiten es noch mehr zu geniessen als zuvor und ausserdem machen die Modder eine saubere und sehr gute Mods die sie uns zur Verfügung stellen. Ich kann Total War Attila nur empfehlen auch an die die nicht mit der Reihe bewandert ist so wie ich ;)
es macht aufjedenfall ein haufen Spass. Das einzige was mich im prinzip stört ist das es der Untergang Roms ist und die Hunnen das Spiel grossteils dominieren^^ aber auch dafür gibts Mods mit oder ohne es macht Spass (Y). Dies ist mein aller erstes Review hoffe es ist nicht dermassen schlecht geschrieben =>

Pro
Netter Prolog
Einzelspieler Kampagne.
Mehrspieler Kampagne mit Freunden ein richtiger Spass.
Workshop.
Schöne Grafik und Atmosphäre.
DLCs (Ja es ist immer sehr umstritten das Thema aber wer es nicht mag muss es auch nicht zwingend kaufen. ;))
Rundenbasiert
Kampfsystem Scheren Stein Papier Prinzip

Kontra
Variationen der Stimmen.
Starke Hunnen mit zahllosen Stacks dazu deren Belagerungsgeräte die meiner Meinung zu stark sind.
KI (Die nicht im stande ist bei der Belagerung die Stadt einzunehmen und plündert nur.)
Schlechte Optimierung des Spiels.
Wenige Fraktionen im Hauptspiel vorhanden erst mit den DLCs spannender.
Schwache Bogeneinheiten die kein Schaden anrichten ausser der Armbrustschützen.

Im Grossen und Ganzen ein super Spiel das zu dem Vollpreis gekauft werden kann ohne bedenken zu haben.

10,18066305,english,"It seems strange to give a game I spent 200 hours playing a bad review. However, that's exactly what I'm going to do. 

You see, TW gamers really want these games to be good. They NEED them to be good and for a while will suspend disbelief to believe they are good. 

But is TW Attila actually a good game?  Well, it's better than Rome 2 and has the features that should have been included in that release like family trees, progression for your general and a political system. The atrocious UI has also been replaced with more realistic models and the overall atmosphere is much better than the overly colorful Rome 2. 

So what's wrong with it? 

Well first of all the game just isn't very well balanced and players will typically experience campaigns that are either mind numbingly easy or unfairly difficult. The AI will spawn endless stacks even when losing territory while the player is saddled with an untenable corruption mechanic. In Shogun 2 the AI cheating was annoying but tolerable as there were lots of bottlenecks on the map to strategically place your armies and the overall economy felt fair. In this game you can look forward to playing whack a mole while struggling to maintain your own armies. Now some may disagree and say this is appropriate to the period but the bottom line is it becomes a chore. 

Another constant irritant is the neverending rebellions because of high corruption and unhappiness. While rebellions were very common in this period they occur so often as to be a hinderance to decent gameplay. When playing as the ERE a HUGE amount of your time will be spent fighting identical city battles due to this mechanic. The buildings don't seem to do a good job mitigating this and the agents are expensive and in short supply. 

Again, Shogun 2 handled this better by having rebellions be conducted primarily by renegade generals rather than regions. Provinces would only revolt if the castle was destroyed or there wasn't a sufficient garrison. You could always suppress dissent through agents and armies but in Attila it seems like the rebellions occur almost randomly. I want to fight the enemies of ROME not an endless parade of my own generals in very similar settings. 

The sieges and AI are much improved from Rome 2 but most of your encounters will be on smaller city maps. Essentially every battle you fight will be in a small city and they all more or less look the same. There is a fort in the middle that doesn't have a gate and pathways to it from the city streets that you can sometimes barricade. Eventually there will be a scrum at the entrances or fort and now we rinse and repeat. 

CA could have made these battles more interesting by featuring upgradable city walls and fortifications which of course would have been characteristic and appropriate to the period. Instead we have repetitive, arcade style maps that are clearly designed to compensate for the lack of a dynamic siege AI. The battles are too quick overall and the goofy unit icons are not a welcome addition IMO either. 

Magic fleets were a disaster in Rome 2 and they still are here. You can count on seeing AI stacks stuck in the middle of Mare Nostrum that will defeat your regular navies but oftentime sit and do nothing.  Since armies can embark and attack in one turn you will also pull your hair out when settlements are sacked in massive amphibious assaults that can't be defended or reasonably predicted.

This game also has bugs and seems to be poorly optimized for modding which is a big issue for a title with so many balancing issues. In my last game I was being forced to sack a city for the second time because I couldn't move an army the following turn out of the city radius without doing so. Apparently this was an issue that was fixed but not if you are using certain mods so I guess vanilla is the only option for a bug free experience. Certainly not ideal if you're playing TW game. 

Anyway, save your money and buy Shogun 2 or get this game when it's $15. The new features in this game should have just been patched to Rome 2. 

It's a very similar type of release to NTW which CA put out to redeem itself after Empire TW's disastrous launch.

24,18432254,english,"This game is worth buying if you are a Total War fan and you don't already have Rome 2.

It does all the good things the right way, such as: combat in general, unit upgrades, general and special unit management, city management and upgrades, technology tree, map movement and control.

It does everything else in way that is either frustrating because it could/should have been done differently or it is so bad you will ignore it entirely.  These are:  diplomacy, family tree, gold (costs and support vs earning potential), religion, culture... AI in every way needs help to the point where the Picts are conquering regions in Africa despite having only one city in Scotland and the Western Romans spend all their units fighting in the Middle East while systematically loosing every city they have in Europe.

I applaud the Devs for trying to take a game like Rome 2 and modding it so hard it became a new(ish) game.  I am sad that they didn't really balance all of the features or flesh out all aspects of the AI, even this late after release.  With mods, however, this game is very much more balanced as the community have addressed the shortfalls in various ways.

If you do already have Rome 2, don't waste your money, you already have 90% of the game.  The only new features you are missing are the very same ones that generally suck and need mod support to fix.  You can get mods for ROme 2 that already give you so much more within that game that if I did I blind swap between the two you would think it was just a reskin (which is basically is in the first place).

As for you ""Creative"" Assembly, as a fan of your franchise I feel betrayed and that I am being taken advantage of from your DLC of factions, which should be included in the inital release. Take notes from Rockstar and Valve, they release content free all the time and prove you can still be profitable.

Have nothing but praise for this game, except for the DLC. I always play my Total War games on very hard, as I enjoy the challenge, and I always get a challenge, sometimes it frustrates me, but hey I knew what I was in for.

The AI, I feel is very solid. In battles most of their moves make sense, and I still struggle in non defensive battles. Campaign map AI is solid as well.

I really like the introduction of the nomad and migrating factions. It definitaly adds a new dimension and playstyle. to the series of the Total war games.

Bringing back of the family tree was amazing. Also the introduction of skill trees for Agents is pretty awesome, Makes levelling them up more rewarding.

CONS.

The worst thing about this game is the DLC. The fact that every faction on the grand campaign map, is not playable is nonsense. And the fact that they introduce DLC, in the form of unlocking factions with a few features is preposterous and infuriating. I have to pay to play as some of the British factions, North African and Viking Factions, with a few new features and Units. The Last roman Campaign I can see, as it adds more then just factions.

Also Diplomacy is quiet broken in my opinion. It is solely based on a factions attitude towards you. This should not be a determining factor, especially in trade agreements where it is mutually beneficial towards both factions. The diplomacy just feels to light, which is something I hope gets adressed and improved in Future games.

Game crashed on me today when I won an epic battle.....wasted 30 minutes of my life! Had to reload and do it over.
This time, the pathing of the units was totaly stupid [but then it always has been!] causing a lot to get killed.
When grouping units into a line then pressing testudo formation....only 2/3 did it. You have to baby sit the whole process! I know it is only a game, but I like things done properly with minimal casualties [as you would in real life].

The towers kill a lot of your own men as well as the enemy. There is no way of controlling them [to switch off/fire direction etc.]

You would think the units especially the fleets would be better [hundreds of years down the line], but no, they are worse.
I know the game is 'different' to Rome II, but Rome should have the capability to build archers/balista/cav units from the start, but one has to research it again.

asked some questions about (amazigh berbers)  in fourms  http://wiki.totalwar.com/w/Total_War_ATTILA

50,18293076,english,"What I liked:
+The battles are very well done and feel very exciting
+Units have been balanced quite well compared to its predecessor, Rome II
+The campaign mode is very, very fun to play and change history with. For example, after the Western Roman Empire fell in my Geats campaign, I settled all of Italy and started a Geatish Empire based out of Scandanavia.
+Diplomacy and politics are back in this game, after they were stripped from Rome 2. There are actual meaningful effects that occur from random events, like the death of the Pope. If you're a Christian faction, which I was during my WRE playthrough, you'll get a huge public order penalty across your nation and you must find a way to overcome it. You also need to make sure your ruler/ruling party is maintaining a respectable level of control as well as allowing others a position of power, or else you'll have a civil war... and you don't want a civil war.
+The graphics are quite impressive but nothing ground-breaking, even with Extreme settings on. Nonetheless, it'll make your game look pretty enough.
+Very stable right now. I haven't encountered any bugs or glitches for a long time, except for one: when your men are in Defensive Testudo (a heavy defensive formation) and they are in heavy combat for a while, sometimes they will reform their formation sideways or something, allowing the enemy to hit them from behind. You just need to keep an eye on them and make sure their formation is facing the correct way.
+The UI is great. It feels modern, and I always have a difficult time going back to the old Total War games because I am spoiled from CA's advancements in their recent titles.
+The campaign AI is much better this time around. They'll actually bring large armies to oppose you, and in logical ways. The Romans make decisions as they did in the real life timeline, the Huns are very tough to deal with no matter which faction you play as, and the Sassanids use their vassals to create huge problems for you.
+The time period itself is interesting, good choice by CA.

Some things I didn't like:
-The DLC whoring, though CA themselves probably doesn't have much control over it. Honestly, this doesn't bother me much because the unique factions come in the base game. Those DLC packs are just 3 copy-and-paste factions sold for $8. Long story short, you won't be missing anything if you skip the DLC - just as it should be.
-The classic Total War battle AI is back. They made steps forward with Attila, but there are some returning issues. If the AI ""doesn't know where you are"" (they always know), they'll do their best to convince you by marching their units back and forth in front of the tree line where you are hiding. 
-Even after you sign a non-aggression pact with a faction, they can still raid your provinces with no penalty. All you can do is declare war and drive the army out.
-Politics still take a back seat in this game. As long as you click the right options for the dynamic events, you will be fine. If you want to get ahead, you'll need to put some effort in but not much.
-You will have to micro your units in battles maybe more than you should. They'll start doing stupid things like chasing routed units across the map who have 5/160 men left when they should have turned their focus to the next active enemy unit. 
-Naval battles are still boring.
-You don't have much control over your vassals in campaign.

*I may have neglected to mention a few things in this review, but I wrote from the things I remembered most in my 100+ hours of playing.

Conclusions:
Attila is my favorite Total War game to date. It's very well done and you can see how CA's many years of experience have been coming together. There are minor issues that'll make you yell at your monitor on occassion, but those are in every good game. I'd like to see a more developed vassal mechanic in the next game, as well as deeper politics and diplomacy.

MODS help this game A LOT but not enough if you ask me. ROme 2 has better frame rates, better graphics, more engaging civs... NO F***ING hordes, and music score is alot better. 

Seriously. LEave this game if you have it installed. Remove it from libary. get rome 2, play it, love it. Atilla? You can suck it. Never played a game like this: it has more downs then ups....

I've tried to make myself like this game played as the Saxsons, Mongols, romans, and a cople of the migrating factions, and i had a good time. However i can not over look the fact that CA released 3 DLC before they patched this game and all it did was allow you to play as factions that already exist in this game, which means they should've been fully playable at launch.

On a positive note this does run considerably smoother then TWR2 ever has and i like ther fact that the cities get more damaged durring seiges, but once again the AI will seldom choose to fight you any where but the cities so it only makes sence for the cities to look even better. And the attrition system is so sever that if you've built your food economy on just base furtility by year 420 you'll be starving and dealing with revolts every few turns all across your sprawling empire. 
The Roman factions play basically the same the only differance being the size of the economic problems they face at the start of the game. Both Roman Factions use Basically the same units only with a pallet swap from red to purple. 

If for any reason you do choose to get a total war game please go with Shogun 2 or fall of the Samurai, Unless you are dead set on this game in which case only getting this on sale and with the DLC will  you find a full realease and be happy.

This should have been a DLC for Rome II in my opinion, the same way Barbarian Invasion was Rome I. It in no way feels like a new game. 

The only addition is the ability to change your faction to and from a city based civilization into a roaming horde. This is the only positive I can find in the game.

The food, public order and now addition of squalor in your cities means you spend most of you time sitting around trying to figure an ideal build for each province not to get a high income or create good troops but to just manage those things. It makes the game feel more like a an ancient city sim rather than a game about waging war.

There is also a new feature where as you reseach new tech and unlock higher quality troops these troops replace the older ones so you can only recruit elite troops by end game which have stupid upkeep costs that make it not worthwhile at all.

An example of the upkeep issue is this: Say you're playing as the Huns with 4 hordes. Each horde has 10 of the tier 1 horse archers. You then upgrade the tech to mid tier horse archers. They are slightly better troops but the upkeep increases by about 200%. Basically to upgrade your 4 hordes requires a spare 8000 gold a turn to cover the cost. It will take a while to have that kind of money being generated. It's just a broken system that wouldn't be a problem if the new troops didn't replace the old ones.

Because of the need to balance every provinces needs. i.e. Food, Happiness, Squalor, you can no longer specialise provinces into money makers or troop makers. The main problem is without a positive food supply in a province that province gets a 25% decrease to wealth, it doens't matter if you make surplus food in another province. It's just stupid.

As your empire gets bigger you suffer ridiculous corruption penalties which end up reducing your income by 80% and guess what? There's no real way to reduce this faction wide. Only in a few provinces can you affect this by using a governor.

The mini game that is politics has been improved slightly but it's easy to handle and still tedious and only exists to stop civil wars basically. If this system was made to be incredibly powerful if handled well (maybe it could tie in with corruption) and dangerous if handled poorly then I could see a point to it but in its current state I'd rather it didn't exist at all. The senate feature from Rome I was better than anything in a modern TW which shows how poorly this game is developed if they can't improve on something that old.

Nearly all the factions feel the same. So many factions have ""Germanic Spears"", ""Germanic Archers"", Germanic Horsemen"", that it feels like there's only 4 factions in the game. Germanic, Eastern, Roman and Huns. There just didn't seem to be much effort put into making the factions feel unique. Maybe the DLC factions have more variety to them but i'm not spending another £20 to unlock those just to find out.

Finally I find the time period boring but that's just a personal opinion.

Overall I paid £15 for the game so i don't feel ripped off at least but I genuinely wouldn't buy it if I had the chance to go back.

80,18172410,english,"[u]PROS:[/u]

1. It's better than the disastrous abortion that is Rome 2, though still nowhere near as good as Shogun 2, Medieval 2 or Rome 1.

2. It manages to feel like the world is crumbling and the light of the Roman Empire is being extinguished by barbarian hordes - also known as IMMERSION... another thing Rome 2 never achieved.

3. The music is an improvement over the dull, forgettable music in Rome 2, though still not as good as it would have been if Jeff Van Dyck had done it (WHY DID YOU NOT USE HIM CA!?)

[u]CONS:[/u]

1. Almost every problem with combat from Rome 2 persists in this installment. 

2. Unit collision is still absent. There's a fake imitation of unit collision that they've tried to implement but it makes units look odd when battle commences. You see them sliding around and melting in to each other very often.

3. Charges still look pitiful, especially cavalry charges. In Rome 1 and Medieval 2 when foot soldiers charged it looked realistic, ferocious. When cavalry charged it looked powerful, men went flying all over the place, cavalry soldiers would go flying off their horses due to the impact. In Rome 2 and Attila cavalry charging looks like 2 balloons bouncing in to each other. There's no force, it's just pitiful.

4. Plus almost every other problem from Rome 2 persists.

[u]CONCLUSION:[/u]

You can get some fun out of it (I did/still am) but what you see here, along with Rome 2, is the death of Total War. To compare Total War to the Roman Empire-

Rome 1 was the reign of Augustus (peace, stability, everybody happy)

Medieval 2 was the reign of Vespasian (a return to stability after the chaos of the year of four emperors)

Empire was the Crisis of the Third Century (chaos, not looking good)

Shogun 2 was the reign of Diocletian (a return to power, stability and strong leadership after the utter chaos before)

Rome 2 was the disastrous reign of Honorius (doing nothing while the empire crumbles)

Which leaves us with Attila. Attila is the last flexing of muscle from a dying empire. It's Aetius's stand against Attila, where he managed to turn the Huns back at the battle of the Catalaunian Plains. But the empire still died a couple of decades later, just like Total War is dead now.",1443104382,1443104546,False,7,2,0.508434116840362549,0,True,False,False,76561198006617832,171,62,17890,0,3685,1583937778,,

For example, the cool bonuses the Desert factions get in the Empire of Sands DLC create a totally new way to play the game. Or the Viking Forefathers pack which gives you all sorts of cool little questlines that pop up, with the consequences of your decisions creating a unique general to recruit for Grand Campaign.

Is it perfect? No. Do I recommend you buy all the DLC? No. I really love this historical time period and so I had no problem paying a little more, but I realize that isn't the case for everyone. What I do recommend though is picking up TW:A next time it's on sale, and giving it a go. I promise you will have a good time, DLC or no DLC. I don't understand how this game has a 67% positive rating (at time of review) other than people hating because of DLC, which is understandable to a point. CA really did a good job on this one, overabundant DLC be damned, that shouldn't overshadow that this is a seriously fun game.

I feel that Attila is what Rome 2 should have been. Fun to play. Where I felt in Rome 2 that if you played one nation you pretty much played them all I feel quite differant here. There is so much variation between factions! 
Hordes are wholly differant from the static Roman empires and the Sassanids or a smaller tribe are wholly differant again. With one faction you need to hold your ground and dig in, with others you need to expand and grab what you can.

Tech trees and general/governor and agent skill trees are quite varied as well which adds even more replay value and variation. The family tree and the politics it brings really made me enjoy the backstabbing political game where I disliked the lack of it in Rome2 intensly. A huge improvement.

The only thing I really dislike is the decreasing fertility but there are mods to remove that.

My advice: Wait for a sale and grab this game! Once CA stops peddling DLC's for things the main game should have included (all faction packs and blood) then buy games for the full price again.

- Battle Interface
The Interface for battles has been changed but is now much more complex to use. 

- Unit variety is bland
The units feel very bland for almost all factions (they all feel the same as to Rome II). Aside from the crossbow, they barely have mixed the feel up. Although this maybe due to the fact that I'm more accustomed to using Rome which are no longer the ""protagonists"" in the game. (Goths and Huns are the new protagonists) 

- Campaign Interface isn't user friendly.
All in the title.

- Menu looks exactly the same as Rome II
Albeit a few minor differences (background)

This game is basically a Rome II expansion pack. I'm hoping CA would do what they normally do with their games and that is turning this piece of sh*t into a masterpiece.

diseases and illnesses, dont worry, they wont affect you in real life,,,,i think :s

Chronicles
new barbarian invasion takeup from rtw1:BI
see rome as a fallen faction
settlement battles are way to nice for your eyes to enjoy.......which bring the next pro...:
SIEGES ARE, AND IN NO WAY A JOKE, FU-CK-ING AMAZING!
UI/ease of controls
huns.......do i need go into details
more detailed and better tech and building trees
units have experience and tiers!!!
map size, though to me  , it feels smaller than total war rome2
mods   (PRAISE DRESDEN/RADIOUS) and other notables!
FAMILY GUY, but f*** the guy/s that go with separist faction.......
game is, and this is not a con, (unless you make this looking like a unbalancing issue, but its meant to be) VERY EXTREMELY HARSH, when playing certain factions.......*whispers of western empire*

with rometw/BI REMADE, all whats left is ALEXANDER, this hinting in a remake for that, if so , MAKE IT A DLC FOR ROME2 AND MAKE ROME2 BATTLE SYSTEM UP TO DATE AND EVERYTHING!!!!!

DISLIKE:

framerate issue, i run rome2 extreme on 60fps, but atilla  runs 60fps on medium, 5-11fps on extreme VERY DISSAPOINTING

unit variety..............not much i touch on this subject later in review...

everything seems unbalanced without any mods

DLC PRICES......

Feels repetitive being 80-90% barbarian-ish units and battles feel like going dejavu-E, whereas rome 2 always felt new and fresh

the campaign when playing a barbarian faction feels so dull.

needs a ton of reworking/balancing/fixing

WHERE ARE PLAYABLE:
                SAMATIANS
                ALEMANNI ( IF U BRING THIS, THEN I WILL CONSIDER A LPlay series for first time)
                *the few factions that still used greek army fashion*
                *few greek factions*

game is broken-
 play EASTERN Roman Empire army, once you get stability, build immortal cav, and can still build cheap infantry, they dont need upgrades on cav cuz they so strong too...

 play Alans/ostrogoths/vandle/visigoths/franks  (germanic horsemen, archers(200range) general horses .....

 play germanic rosters with no germanic cav general, begunds can be arguably be as good as alans etc

nerf CAV and buff infantry so its worth actually recruiting infantry in a campaign....... but keep huns cav op :D as they were.
                                                                              VERDICT out of 10's

BATTLE GAMEPLAY                      9 (alot better than ROME II)

RTS NEWBIE FRIENDLY                4 (unlike other total war games, this has ALOT of features that are hard to understand)
CINEMATICS                                10(VERY FUN, REALISTIC,HISTRORIC,EPIC SENSING)
SOUND                                        4( i find the music, appauling , but thats just me)(no epics like the whole series HAS)
GRAPHICS                                    7-10(if FRAMERATE becomes fixed as mentioned in review then 10)
MODS                                          9(no *huge overhaul* as of yet but many mods do exist that are Game awe-inspiring)
BALANCING                                4(remember when RTW1, you just pick sparta, and win.....well, its kinda like this....)
REPLAYABILITY                           5( unlike rtw2, playing a barbian faction , and then playing another, is like going to work, everyday..............repetitivness, but having said that, there is slight variety, such as east empires, nomads, roman empires ,sassinids , campaigns will change each time,

FULL VERDICT SCORE- 7(this is not an average)

if you are a experienced TW gamer, then you are most likely to love this, however, the different vibe/feel/motion of the game can feel uneasy as its to give a death!  vibrance to the campaign map and battles, ok, getting past that once you learn how to play the game if you new or learning the new features, you are welcomed into a somewhat replayable game, where you can dominate as either different cultured barbarians(lets face it, they all are....) eastern factions,or Roman fallen empires.

theres 3 main ways to play the game:

Maintain an empire, if you played ROME2 and nearly every other total war game, this is basically familiar standings of how you know how to play, except you have hordes on every border, that can take you down.

hording......do what huns do best.

Raiding....do what cheeky barbarians do best

yh, you do have those cultural/military wins, but  i dont find them ways to play, but somthing to focus your gameplay towards.


OK SO, the game is excellent in terms of SIEGING GAMEPLAY, BATTLES. but when factions are unbalanced, you take note that just rushing 20 stacked immortal horse units into an enemy literally, wins the campaign for you as eastern empire.

the biggest issues that i have are:

FPS weirdly low framerate at extreme and normal scrapes the 60fps mark( using a high end gaming laptop)

balancing......use horses, win, upgrade horses to beat lesser graded.(yh, tier system is fun tho)

I CANT PLAY ALEMANNI :'(            (this is a big deal for me, cuz i played them 24/7 on BI)

I CANT LEFT CLICK MOVE A GROUP/SINGLE UNITS NO MORE :'(

family features couldve done with more functionality.







REGARDLESS, I HAVE PLAYED EVERY TW SINCE 2001, but I AM NOT! getting warhammer,,,,,,the f*** you go fictional with magic n sh it,,,,why......total war? dont you go all magical on me TCA, anywho....................................

This is basically a modern day Barbarian invasion, i do recommend to hardcore TW FANS, but not to new TW players, to play older TW games, beforehand.

if i had choose 3 outlying problems in order that needs attention:

#1 WEIRD FPS ON EXTREME ON HIGH END COMPUTER, WHERE IT RUNS 60FPS MEDIUM...(EXTREME 60fps on rome II but...)
#2 ALEMANNI
#3 BALANCING OF HORSES AND MAKE INFANTRY...VALUABLE.....

THANK YOU GUYS, FOR STAYING IN THIS FOR THE LONG RUN, AND HOPE TCA CONTACT ME ABOUT OUTLYING PROBLEMS

The game is so in depth though. If you are into strategy, then here it is. No doubt. I think they made a lot of improvemnts of Total War Rome II which was their most recent release before this one.

The graphics are rather optimizable, but it is because I believe the developers were trying to prepare for the future. A lot of the options can be turned off for better FPS, but I had a little lag. With the highest settings on everything, I got about 30 FPS.

They have a new political system which can really make a difference, and they are sticking with something that has been successful in the past: Total War. Your environment takes on more of an important role in this release though, so be mindful of that.

Yes but you can piss people off by BURNING THEM TO THE GROUND!!!

-Learn from CDProjekt Red about approach to DLCs and expansions

43,18047996,english,"Honestly I've played every total war game ever and really enjoyed most of them. This game is well made, graphics are good if u have a gaming rig. I think most of the complaints about this game are the stupid DLC packs which are just there to nickle and dime their fan base which is totally douchy but it doesnt make this a bad game. This is in the top three of the franchise in my opinion.  First being medieval total war and second being empire.  My only complaint about this game is that it gets really difficult to maintain any large empires. Im currently playing as Rome and I've help onto all of Africa and Italy. I have the breadbasket of the known world and im barely getting a food surplus I think they need to be more lax, north africa and europe were not infertile wastelands it is simply there to make the game more challenging. However the battles are amazing - if a little quick. Slower than Shogun thank god but I long for the days where units hacked at eachother for several minutes if they both wore heavy armor. That made battles far more strategic with flanking as once units were committed they would hold their own allowing you the player to strategically move your unit around the field as though it were a chess board gaining an advantage over your enemies. However units unless in defence stance will whittle eachother away in less than a minute. Anyways overall gameplay is great, battles and units are beautiful and the combat animations with the gore DLC are awesome. (FYI only DLC i recommend the others are a waste just download mods that unlock every faction save ur cash for a company that isnt trying to milk you for all ur worth. 

Back to my main point its definately worth a playthrough if you enjoy the total war franchise, also see a return of politics within ur faction but also for ur immediate family requiring you to secure loyalty, maintain control of ur countries Gov't bodies or risk revolts.

48,18041018,english,"I have played Shogun 2, Napoleon, as well as Rome 2; and with how much hype I had for this game, I am dissappointed.

When people complained about Rome 2, I could understand the reviews (I personally loved it at the end of all of the clutter-fucky, Glory to Macedon; and unto Carthage!). When I started Shogun, the playstyle ruined me, but it was very enjoyable and a very well made game.

Attila? My biggest issues follow; Horrible Horde mentality of the AI. They send every small army they can across the map to either; 
A) Hunt you down because fuck it. 
or
 B) Send all the small armies to a single army leaving the rest of their territory unguarded.

My other issue is that if you start off as a small faction, the game is greatly hindered and slowed to a walk, while playing as any other, larger, faction (Example - the single eastern faction excluding DLC_Sassanids...) The game is very fast paced and between trying to fix the horrible lay out of the cities various upgrades, maintaining public order, quelling up rising, wars, and various other issues, it can be over baring for someone looking for a moderatly paced game, and just trying to enjoy themselves. 

You only get to options; play one of the very bland, copy and pasted factions for a slow/ forced moderate paced gameplay, or try to play a unique faction and get a bunch of issues thrown into your face.

I enjoyed building my Empire up from nothing in Rome 2, I enjoyed expanding my Clan's borders in Shogun. But being given a large mass of land and trying to fix the errors of idiotic forefathers, no. I would rather start another, un-modded Macedon campaign in Rome 2. Or raise the Date/Hojo clan to greatness an upteenth time.

Attila is enjoyable, do not get me wrong, i enjoy the Sassanids, they are a breath of fresh air when the world is full of dead romans, desolate lands, and a bunch of inbred barbarians. But if you do not micromanage everything, or do not pay attention to all of the chaos around you (which with many people with families will be unable to do) You will quickly be over-powered, or even overthrown.

Just kept pushing dlc smack on the corner, trying to make a buck without care of the quality of their product.

Dlc for blood, dlc for vomit, more money for my top shelf product it's the bees knees!!!

Bugs were plenty in it, crawling everywhere, but we didn't care we needed our TW fix.

Finally they have removed most of the bugs(after they were done cranking dlc, oh wait actually they still arent done another dlc product in the pipe!)

And at the end of the day, I can say the unit rosters are shallow, they clearly spent more attention on creating more dlc than fixing their bugs during the first year this game was out. The AI is not great but is pretty challenging on legendary.
Legendary autosaves every moment tho creating a thousand annoying stutters on campaign map even on ssd.

If you want your total war fix and don't care that the dealer of it doesnt give a shit about you just wants your cash and is fine with leaving bugs in their products so that they can make more dlc for more cash instead then sure go ahead and get it, Ive dropped 100+hrs on campaign in it and at the end of the day it wasn't worth it

65,18007974,english,"Turn based game on the main map. Battles are real-time. Large battles, city building, and diplomacy are the three main focuses of Total War franchise. Religion, trade, and culture are also in there as well. Not to mention agents. 

Lots of different fations to play as, all very different from each other, such as Celts, eastern empires, Romans, Germanic peoples and more. Each culture has a large variety of units that set if apart from the others. One of my favorite things about this game is how each faction is so unique, most of them having vastly different play styles depending on what units they can recruit and what faction traits they have.     

Map is enormous, from Spain to modern day Afghanistan and England to North Africa. 

City building is fun, you have to plan strategically how you are building each city, because if you have a plan you can make cities focus on certain aspects like industy, trade hub, military center, things like that. You must balance out food, public order, and squalor at the same time to maintain cities.

Game is bit complex, but if you are a little patient you can learn it in a resonable amount of time, especially if you watch youtube videos. Its not nearly as complex as Crusader Kings 2, and slightly less complex than Civilization games. I like this game far more than both of those. 

Not much bad I can say about this game bc I like it so much, but I will say this game takes a long time to play. One campaign can run you easily over 200 hours if you see it through to the end, and thats just one campaign. There are roughly a dozen factions that come with the base game, plus 9 or 10 more with the DLCs, so if you do multiple campaigns you can put some serious time into this game. There is also multiplayer. 

Game looks great too, on campaign map and in battles. Gotta have a decent pc though. 

Great game. Certainly one the best grand strategy games out there. Overall 8.5/10

68,17999908,english,"Creative Assembly isn’t being greedy. Not one bit. They are just accurately reflecting the cutthroat reality of dark age business. Attila ravaged Europe, and 1600 years later, CA ravaged my wallet.

Allow me to explain why it’s fitting that Creative Assembly chose the era of Attila for their latest installment of the Total War series. After years of painstaking historical research, I have come to the conclusion that CA based their pricing model on common dark age business practices. There is a tale, for instance, of High King Schwarzenegger, a Gothic monarch of the Conan tribe, who purchased a sword but only received a hilt. When the king complained about the hilt that he paid full price for, the smith told him that blades were sold separately and that if the king wanted a scabbard, that too would require another purchase. Awhile later, when the king dressed for battle, his squires fitted him with some leather padding, but when the king called for his chainmail, he was told that he needed to pay for that separately and that each sleeve, the headpiece, and the full chest arrangement would be forged over the next few months and then put up for sale as optional content. King Schwarzenegger, now fed up with the whole process, and with his credit card thoroughly maxed out, called for his horse. He would ride into battle naked. When the squires wheeled in the king's horse on a cart without a head and hooves, the king shouted out, ""Hasta la vista, baby!"" He then attempted to commit seppuku by falling on his sword, but was disappointed to discover that it's impossible to stab yourself with just a hilt. 

It was this kind of desperation, ladies and gentleman, that drove the high king to make a movie as monumentally bad as ‘Kindergarten Cop’. And it was this kind of desperation that led us well-intentioned strategy gamers to spend $80 on such an incredibly realistic dark age business simulator.

I bought it watching all those positive reviews, but i was totally disappointed. Game is ugly, boring, it is almost identical to rome 2 but with an unfinished/ugly/boring feeling.

There was one simple late roman tactic rto add, the Fulcum (shields overlapping to form a wall), i was excited to see at least that single improvement...not, not even that. They simply remad the defensive testudo....and they even called it ""defensive testudo"", because changing the name was maybe to time consuming, I guess.
Units look ugly, very ugly. I played a rome 2 mod about late empire and it was 10 times better, and it was free. UNits have no variation, everyone wears same armor and armors too are very unhistorical and unrealistic.
Names of units are simply a casual melting of some late roman units. They could have made much, much better, on my opinion.
40 euroes wasted. I had more fun playing some of the many mods for rome 2.

I wanted to love it....
I wanted to give this a big thumbs up....


There are two main problems why I can't despite all the improvements such as the family tree:

1. Sega and CA clearly intend to bleed me dry of my funds over a sustained period by drip feeding me, what appears to be basic content which should be in vanilla, and unfortunatly they are starting to take the piss with the prices. Remember Vanilla is a flavour Sega it doesnt have to be tasteless... I want delicious madagascan vanilla flakes in my total war!!

Which leads me on to my next point; Just like my taste in women this game is like a supermodel who has got an eating dissorder. She is hot and im totally in to her BUT I need to wait until she starts eating again and gets her self esteem back before I can get ""excited"".

2. Limited number of units / construction options (no AOR), where if you upgrade your military you are forced to have only elite units and can no longer recruit the basic version, leaving you spending a fortune on a small army. There seem to be only a few map models for towns in the north (where I am playing) so every village seems to be a replica of the last one. I am sure the models vary as you move between cultures but it seems a bit bland. The overall feel and graphics of the game are however more polished.


However, the skeleton for something amazing has been provided and I am thankful for that. If I knew I would not have to give them further money to unlock factions I should be a really happy chap. I will now go back to playing the DEL mod of Rome 2 which is currently a hugely superior game than Attilla (Vanilla) and wait for the modders to be allowed to ""put the meat on the bones"" so to speak.

I have no doubt that given 6 months of development the likes of Radious and Del will actually turn this into something superb. But I feel like I want to give the community the credit rather than sega. because their marketing strategy is leaving a very bitter taste in my mouth!


My Advice - wait for the workshop to be opened and or a deal on the game. You will enjoy the game more then. So I am not recomendin the game at this precise moment until the player content makes it worthwhile... Then I will swap to a thumbs up but I will be picking and choosing my DLC's (if i buy any) very carefully later on.

.....

Update! - Well Attila i am afraid has still not won me over and kicked my ass into giving him a thumbs up. I am fairly sure all CA's time is now going into warhammer and possibly rightly so. 

I have pondered and pondered as to what this game lost from Rome 2 (yes i still think its better sorry). In reality as before I am really comparing modded Attila to modded Rome 2.

its hard to put your finger on exactly what the problem is and despite the new family tree the game actually feels less RPG and more Arcade and I just cant get into it.. simply put i find it a bit boring. I think this is mainly down to the only decent game changing mod being radious which is pretty much what he goes for, thats being more arcade style with loads of unit stacks. I am not saying Radious is boring because its not, that man puts in serious effort in his mods and should be saluted but its just not for me. So if you always loved Radious you will probably love Attila - Radious 

I think its the old school players who cant settle here  as there is no: Rome total realism, Stainless Steel or Divide et Impera style mod (yet). There is one on the horizon though called ageless empires which I have high hopes for. So for the moment I will stick to Rome 2 and it seems I am not alone. 

Going back to my original analogy of Attila needing some Meat, Radious has done this and my Attila sexy supermodel seems to have eaten too many pies now. certainly fleshed out but Im looking for something a bit more toned and athletic... yes i know im picky... but I want Attila Del style damnit... :D",1425239460,1441708940,False,566,58,0.763095438480377197,32,True,False,False,76561198007245699,85,8,14676,0,5796,1596838241,,

94,17928900,english,"If you're still on the fence about getting this game, I'd say go ahead and jump on board. ATTILA brings many challenges to the table for veteran Total War fans.

Pros:
+Beautiful looking game, even moreso with modding
+More diplomacy options
+Politics and managing your family are actually important this time around
+Play as an established Empire or roving Horde barbarians, both offer unique challenges
+Most challenging campaign to date (try saving the Western Roman Empire on hard!)
+Battles offer a good mix of enjoyment and challenge, and naval warfare is vastly improved

Cons:
-Terrible campaign AI and army management
-The family tree/political screen can take a bit getting used to
-Enemy agents seem vastly overpowered, while mine that actually survive to level up can still fail with a high chance to succeed
-Long learning curve with province optimization, (at least for me)
-Somewhat lack of unique units
-Can experience long loading times if you don't have a decent rig

Final verdict and thoughts:
Thumbs up. Most of the of cons can be overcome with modding, many of which are found right here on the Steam workshop and easy to install. There are many different ones out there and still some in the works and you're bound to find one that fixes any issues you may have. To date they have the most challenging campaigns to offer if you play as either of the Romans, and even some horde factions as they flee the terror of the Huns.

-Units all the look the same on the battlefield; it's almost impossible to tell who is ally or enemy.
-There is a tiny variation of units. Vast areas of the world with different empires all field the same-stupid-same-looking units. 
-Units' morale is crazy low. I get it, it's scary fighting in a battle; but these guys run at the mere drawing of a sword almost. 
-Battles are so fast you have to continually pause the game to figure out what exactly is going on. 
-Your allies are near useless, they barely ever come to your aid. 
-The AI is mentally challenged.

Yeah, slight problem with that.  Ere can't build garrison quarters, only the WRE can.  Crap, guess i have to work on the cultural victory conditions, not my style, but meh, at least i'll complete it.  WRONG!

3.  Back to the Huns (or, what appears to be any AI faction with numerous full army stacks).  As I mentioned before, I was able to take my horde to Italy and take the whole peninsula, figuring i'd let the huns run amok in the Balkans and central Europe while i built up my power base. After about 80 turns, i figured i had built up enough to push northward, and to my surprise, there were the Huns, just sitting north of the alps, basically loitering about. They made no effort to attack me, but neither did they move to another location (even though they had desolated the entire province). This lasted for another 40-50 turns, at which point i was able to spread out to the east and west and gain enough to build some rather large armies. I then attacked them, which proved costly since Attila had not died yet, so they just kept spawning, at a rate i couldn't keep up with, so i went on the defensive, at which point they again just sat at all the major passes in the Alps and did nothing, not even bothering to attack any of my northern settlements which were poorly defended.  They literally camped out just north of my position for over 100 turns, hemming me in, but making no attempt to attack any position, no matter how weakly it was defended.  The worst part is, they hung out in the mountain passes, making it impossible to get more than a couple armies to attack their position at one time.  http://forums.totalwar.com/showthread.php/149060-AI-being-super-passive-when-in-large-numbers?s=5aec6e3540fd1efe625eff9e6b8017ea

Overall, this game is one giant turd and wasn't even worth the price i got it at on sale.  I am through with all TW games.  Between the numerous DLC's and the numerous game breaking bugs, it is apparent that the developers are either incompetent or more interested in taking people's money than developing a decent game, and more likely than not, both apply.

UPDATE:  After deciding to give this game another shot, i began a campaign as the Saxons.  As you may have noticed in the comments section, I WAS having a good time...Until today.  Once again, i completed a turn and tried to open the faction window and poof, CTD.  This game, at least for me, is completely unplayable as it is.  I even tried, as suggested in the comments, an uninstall and reinstall to no avail.

I would not say you need this game if you have Rome although it is newer and has some new feature it is basically a paint job over Rome II. I like the new changes they made and hope the implement these changes in Medieval 3. Medieval 2 is probably my favorite TW games, but obviously Rome II and Attila are actually superior. One additional gripe about this game is that the developer now seems to try to just shove DLCs out and force you to buy it actually get a full game with all the expected factions and even BLOOD! Blood DLC is the biggest piece of crap ever. Even though it is my favorite series each installment is slowly pushing me more and more away from the publisher.

This was years and years ago. I didn't believe someone had actually made a game where you fight the battles on that scale, and have the campaign map. 

I played them A LOT. Multiplayer, LAN, we even did a really long coop campaign on Medieval 2 using e-mails. 

I played them so much, that I pretty much had a complete list of all the problems with the games, but I didn't really care then since it was new to me, and it was epic. 

The problem is, that the newer games have fixed some of the issues that I had with the older games (slow animations, larger sphere of influence of the armies, some other minor bugs etc.), but then at the same time the serie has just simply gotten worse and worse. It's like they took everything that was really good about this series, threw it out, whilst fixing some of the pre-mentioned pissues, which leaves me in a situation where I don't want to go back to any of the older games in the series, since the new ones have fixed the little things, but on every other aspect they've gotten it wrong. The only exception to this might be Rome I, but I don't even see that happening.

Personally I find that this game is a somewhat large improvement over Rome II, and so far (4 Hrs gameplay) is quite fun. It is slightly more complicated at first I found, but once you get to know whats what it is good!

The menus within the campaign game for me are much better as you can actually see more of what is going on, and the battles are better because unlike in Rome II, the computer enemy actually come and attack you, rather than just standing there. 
The campaign gameplay I found is much more engaging and diplomacy seems to work much better than it has done previously.

As many people have said the negatives of this game are the fact that there is DLC available that should really have been included in the game. For me this is the biggest annoyance, because the game does feel slightly incomplete without them, and most of us will not want to buy all the DLC at £5.99 a time.

But other than that, I'd definitley say that Attila Total War was worth buying, I know I havent played it for very long so far, but I am enjoying it, and it is, as I mentioned earlier, quite a big improvement over Rome II!",1440446553,1440446553,True,1,0,0.499626785516738892,0,True,False,False,76561198020804431,206,5,5029,0,556,1599542118,,

30,16706205,english,"What i say now is not just aimed at Total War but in the state of games and the industry in general, i just wanted to get it of my chest:

I am giving my age away but i come from that era where there was no such thing as DLCs and expansions. Game was complete and very very very stable and almost bug free. Now like the person above said, WE ARE THE TESTERS and we PAY THEM TO TEST THEIR game. I wish this CRAP can stop. But its the users fault because they (me included) starting to pay for all these DLC's and take the crap.

In my defence if i bought a DLC or expansion i expected whole new content like new races or new weapons or stuff but on major scale change so that you can really say this is a change and this DLC worth it.

These days we get DLC's with content i expected in my opinion to have been part of the game in the FIRST PLACE.

For example, Star Craft 2, now we have to buy the DLC's or so called expansions just so that we can play the 2nd race in game (Zerg) and the third expansion coming to play the 3rd race. In the past you got games where you could play all races in single player, each having their own story, cutscenes etc. BUT NO!!!! We have to now buy it as DLC and everyone just throw money at them and now its become the trend, the norm. This is BSHT. Unless people stop throwing money at all these developers and start demanding full games again, then this will never change.

At least CD Project Red tried by taking a step in the right direction, we got a huge game (The Witcher 3) and they giving us 16 Free DLC's for the game, not PAYING but FREE. This is stuff that should have been in game in first place and they are adding it and giving for free BUT.... we are still trapped in this huge DLC or Expansion (whatever you want to call this) nightware where we are paying for stuff that should have been in the game in the first place to make the game COMPLETE.

Never had this 10-20 years ago.

Its a pity how we let them do this to us and gaming just a money making scheme and they always thinking what else can we do to SQUEEZE more money out of the SUCKERS.

Total War sadly went the same route and they are doing it even more to us now, 4 DLC's with stuff that should have been in the game. I am a BIG Total War fan, no, no, no...let me say... I WAS a big fan. I am also fed up with all these DLC's and trying to milk us for everything we have and then get content that should have been in the game in the first place.

Its time WE put DOWN our FOOT and say NO MORE!!!!

If we do not start a REVOLUTION regarding this then it will get WORSE and WORSE. Its time we take the power back and say NO MORE!!! Its time we get FULL games again!!!

This is SERIOUS people (gamers), we allowed this and now we need to STOP this!!! Hurt them where it hurts the most. THEIR WALLETS, THEIR BANK BALANCE.

We need new developers who do this for the love of it and still make a living, but this DLC CRAP is getting redicioules.

IT MUST STOP NOW!!! and it can only be done by YOU!!!

Only real complaint is that battles are, again, too fast. Two equal units fighting head-on should not rip each other to shreds in 30 seconds (and this is on huge unit sizes, 160 men per unit are all dying in 30 seconds - 1 min). Fortunately this is fixed with  a simple mod and the game is great.

DLC hate train has gone through this game though which is pretty much the only reason for the negative reviews.

Since apparently the game was crashing because of some kind of DRM issue (clearing Winsock and Ipconfig wizardry fixed it), I have since fixed the problem.

So, now that I've got it working, do I recommend it? Yes. And No. But mostly yes? I think.

It's a total war game. Hordes are cool. The battle gameplay is fun and intense, the grand strategy still wonky and confusing. Balance is, as always, really weird, so never autoresolve anything beyond overwhelming odds.

It's a fun game. It's violent and bloody. It's full of DRM, presented in that shitty Sega DRM way where you know you'll end up buying the damned product.

70,17302849,english,"Attila Total War; Is it good or is it not?
To start off, Attila Total War is in no way a bad game, despite the things I'm about to say regarding the game. Take these points as a general critique of the series direction in general, while still being a review of the game.
So, Attila Total War; the title says it all really. It's the year 395AD, and the Roman Empire, now divided between Eastern and Western rule, is on the very edge of collapsing after centuries of corruption and economic turmoil. As a result of this, many Germanic and Nomadic barbarian tribes have decided to take a stab at the world superpower, due to its apparent and alarming signs of weakning it's grip on the known world. 
You can either choose to try and save Rome from its fate by taking command of either the Eastern or Western Roman Empires, or become the arbiter of its downfall by taking control of the numerous Barbarian tribes and Eastern Kingdoms that wish to see Rome gone.
But is it good? 
Well, Yes and No.
Positives are that: 
-Despite the disastrous attempt in Rome 2, The politics game mechanic now has actual weight and impact upon your game. It's no longer simply making sure your party is on top, now you have to make sure that faction members remain loyal, Governors are assigned to provinces that need them, and that your general dominion over your faction is kept in a careful balance. Failure to complete these tasks can lead to civil unrest, disloyalty from generals and governors, and even a separatist movement erupting to cause a civil war.
-The sanitation systems that have been updated from Rome 2 now make actual sense, and aren't nearly useless. Now there's a real need for proper sanitation within one's settlement; lack of such sanitation can cause local disease outbreaks, which can spread across your entire empire if you're not careful. 
-After their measly display in Rome 2, both cavalry units and ranged units in Attila have regained some of their former tactical worth. Cavalry are now faster and seem to have a greater impact when charging, and ranged units now do much more damage and have increased accuracy, so both of these unit types are now worth the investment again.
But of course, to every ying, there is a yang. For the good points, there are also bad:
-The sacking and razing options that can be chosen when a settlement is conquered are used way too much by the AI factions, even the civilised ones. I can understand nomadic factions burning a settlement to the ground, but it begins to become unreal when the Persians don't take territory from you; they simply burn your towns and cities. This means, that you will frequently find that you are the only faction in the game actually expanding your borders; everyone else is too busy burning things.
-Although a new and interesting mechanic that has given some historical accuracy to the game, the city Razing mechanic (Destroying an entire city and it's buildings and leaving the region neutral) is a massive pain in the backside. Yes, it might be accurate when a Hunnic horde burns the city of Salona to the ground, but reclaiming that land takes a massive amount of money, population and time to rebuild, and it just becomes a massive waste of time.
These next two are more of a gripe against Both Rome 2 and Attila, but bear with me here (They're essentially the same game anyway)
-In Rome 2, the system of building armies changed quite drastically from previous games in the series. Now, Armies themselves now act as independent characters with traits to improve their effectiveness and morale in the field of battle, rather than simply being a collection of units. Trouble is, they always require a general to manage them; no general - no army. This means that the use of tactical raid parties made up of half an army stack and skirmish groups made of even less are a thing of the past, and you can't leave armies under the command of a captain any more. No longer can you whittle down large armies with the use of clever hit and run tactics. Gone are the days where you fought skirmish after skirmish to get to the larger armies and cities of your enemy. Now, every battle you fight is either a pivotal battle that you must fight or lose  because the auto resolve is about as thick as an asphalt milkshake, (I mean, Legionaries losing to levy spearmen, really?) Or it's a pushover city fight that isn't worth your time or skill.
This means that wars against other factions become a huge chore, and all of the pacing is slowly squeezed out of the game. What does this mean? It means that the game becomes really, REALLY, boring after about half an hour. Unfortunately, Attila suffers this very same problem.
-Also in Rome 2 and Attila, the factions have become more balanced and even, for reasons that are unknown to me; perhaps to facilitate more rounded and player-preference faction choice on the multiplayer section. Now there's two things wrong with this. Firstly, It isn't historically accurate, as with the previously mentioned Legionary-Levy debacle, and it means that even if you win a pitched battle against another enemy army, you'll end up taking so many casualties that the victory really isn't worth it in the long run. Not only does this mean that victory now depends more on numbers, as opposed to the actual skill you needed in previous games of the series, but wars become nothing more than large scale meat-grinders with the winner being whoever can field the largest army. This pile-drives the pace out of the game, as you're always having to wait for more men to back up your depleted units, even after small garrison battles.
Once again, it makes the game slow and really boring.
So, Attila Total War, is it good or is it not? 
In my eyes, this is what Rome 2 should have been on launch, not the disaster that it was. 
However, being someone who's played almost every Total War to date, this game, and Rome 2, are massive disappointments because they just aren't fun anymore. Wars and combat are now too balanced  to be fun, as with the afformentioned meat-grinders, and the game feels more like a chore now than an actual fun experience, which you know, is what a Video Game shouls be. 
I'm not sure why the Creative Assembly have made these changes, but they just don't fit the series and it's mentality. They remove the one thing that makes Total War so unique; the one thing that gave it it's legendary position as one of the most accurate strategy game francises out there; Realism. I know there's an allure to arcade-style combat, but that goes in shooter games and basic strategy games like Halo Wars and Half Life; not a game of this calibre and the reputation the series has.
So, if you simply want an expansion of Rome 2, go right ahead, buy it, because that's all it really is.
If not, I STRONGLY recommend holding back your wallet, and buying the Rome Total War 1 collection instead; it's more realistic and enjoyable as a result. To me, It's a much better investment. Attila, and by extension Rome 2, are good in their own right, but they just aren't good enough to be called Total Wars, if that name still means anything anymore.",1438281942,1438810179,False,1827,63,0.902448177337646484,133,True,False,False,76561198051668983,146,2,16248,0,11917,1526230583,,

That was cool and unordinary couple years back.... 
 
They should have probably be more clear on how much food and money youll get per turn, because with some builds, they will clearly specify that you ll get  +40 food or +350 wealth  and then, they ll add with that info,  +20% of food on the fertility of land, or +40% of wealth income on trades depending on what you choose.
After doing research on your province panel, they will give you the info on your land's fertility (poor, average good).  Then, youll make your assumption with the +20% of food base on that +40 of food per turn....   Of course its not City Skyline, but geez, make it more clear or easy to find out what exactly you re gonna get.

90,17298694,english,"Certainly an improvement in most areas of Rome II. The graphics are impressive, and the battle mechanics are much more logical. They have fixed issues with archers and any ranged weapons being absurdly inaccurate to the point of not needing them. The new features allowing players to Raze cities is a good feature that certainly kicks dirt into your sworn enemies.

However, the AI still cheats. Small nations can spam units, seemly immune to the lack of food. Agents with one star will tear down your nine star general in a max size army assisted by a five star agent of your own (Apparently it's statistically possible for enemy agents to succeed a 10% chance 8 times out of 10). Clearly from the unit rosters the Nations that you are intended to play to get the full Grand campaign experience are either the Huns, or either Roman nations (With Northern kingdoms added for extra flavour if you don't want to tackle the Huns). Except the Roman nations are seemly doomed to fail no matter how hard you try. But, that's due to unbalanced gameplay, rather then intended diffculty. 

Diplomacy may as well not exist. Usually I gather trade partners and allies at the start, yet just by advancing technology, and generally trying to use the features of the game you gain an unavoidable penalty, leaving the entire map against you. The only Nations I have on my side, leaving the majority at war with me are Nations I subjugated. AI doesn't really attempt realism at all. As I played with the Eastern Roman empire I had four stacks of Hunic armies sail directly from Spain, after ending the Western Empire, cross the full length of the Mediterrean Ocean with armies of Horse archers on ships, to deposit next to Alexandria the second I left to attempt a defense against no less then eight armies from the Sassanid Empire.

The Grand campaign seems to be following a programmed script, with events like declarations of war happening regardless of any effort you make. After the Barbarian Kingdoms Raze around 60% of the map, leaving a hard bill of 20000 currency to rebuild each of them from scratch, and the major kingdoms following predetermined orders to annihilate you, you will find the great empire you start with, over twenty cities, suffering from no food and constant rebellions, with a hot side of bankruptancy. You armies suffer attrition to such a degree that a full stack will have 10 people in each unit, with no hint of replenishment in sight.

In summary, if you want to play exactly as history occured, with the failure of the Roman empire (regardless of your efforts), and you like cheating AI that provides an artificial challenge, then buy this game. I don't recomend this game mostly because the Grand campaign is more like a long term scenario, instead of the real total war experience.",1438265039,1438265039,False,40,2,0.578166186809539795,0,True,False,False,76561198009556865,408,9,9286,0,5245,1519910660,,
91,17297219,english,"Being a Total War Veteran spanning from my time playing the original shogun a long long time ago and having tasted the bitter pill that was Rome Total War 2, was very very disappointed in Rome Total War 2 even though I own it I rarely play the game.

Now coming to Attila, the good parts -

On Legendary difficulty the game really comes into it's own, having spent the majority of my time playing the Eastern Roman Empire, it's really really tough going.  

Also there's no chance to reload and undo any mistakes. So each turn can decide the fate of that game. I wouldn't be lying to say I've made terrible errors, lose a giant battle, made some questionable diplomacy decisons that have cost me a 40 hour game and had to restart as a consequence of this. 

I've found the game to be very addictive, that I've spent ages on it, far too much time. To me compared to Rome 2 it has more atmosphere, the graphcis look less plastic like and more natural and thats me having Rome Total War 2 on high compared to Attila on low.


The family tree is back finally :)

The Bad:

There are millions of factions, at the start this is fine but later on in the game if you haven't turned off AI moves which there is an option for, you'll spend ages waiting for the turn time to go. If you turn them off you have to waste time look round the map to see where people have gone and you will forget to do this and out of nowhere a Hun army arrives and razes a city which can be very frustrating.

The AI can be kinda of stupid in that it will charge every 90% during settlement battles in your wave of spears and yes that includes horsemen making a sucicidal charge. It's a 50/50 in legendary you need to exploit this in order to cheese win some battles, although in open field battles the AI will perform pretty decently in my experience. It's the settlement stuff that can be ropey at times.

Yes the AI can magically have 2 full stacks from 1 settlement somehow even if it's the most crummby pronvince in the middle of the Sahara that has no way of making that kind of money and the cheap city happiness boasts which will rarely, if ever see an enemy city rebel or spawn rebels. If you don't believe me check the West Roman Empire and you'll see that magically most of the cities have green faces when the AI play them but when you play them nothing but red faces across the board.

 The annoying AI boasts can feel cheap at times, espeically on legendary and that can be frustrating that they don't play on a level playing field but it has always been like this I suspect.

You must fight alot of your battles yourself, word of warning if you don't especially for the minor settlement garrisons vs barbarian hordes you might be able to whittle down that army or even kill the general routing a larger force which is better then auto resolving and inflicting barely a scratch or even slowing that army down. This can get very tedious when it's the same old backs to the wall tactics and charging your cav in the rear as an attempt to knock out the enemy general quickly and smash the enemy army's morale

Overall:

All in all I like the atmosphere of the game, especially as playing as the Romans desperately trying to drag armies across in time, playing a delaying tactics till your reinforcements arrive.

I haven't played the co-op or head to head campaign but I can imagine that would be quite good. Not sure if the game is well optomised, maybe they are working on patches to majke it run faster hopefully . it is alot slower paced but I've adjusted to that compared to other total war in how turns go. The battles are fast paced and unpredictable how they can go somtimes which is a good thing in my opinon.

1,17234621,english,"A major Improvement on Rome 2 with lots of new ingame features, my biggest gripe is unlike in previous total war games when everything panned out diffrently each time, because its focused on the fall of the roman empire I feel like they are very weak as they pay larger Upkeep costs and recruitment costs meaning smaller armies meaning the roman empires can easily be streamrolled and this takes away from the overall game as the Western Roman Empire specifically might only last around 100 turns, which is only around 25 years ingame time.  The game can also sometimes feel like its over before its really started. What i mean by this is the action if fast and intense, if you play as a Roman nation if you do survive the first onslaught, you will likely feel like the game has become incredibly easy. (I found this at least). Only other issue i can think of is the Ai can be extremely aggressive towards the player especially when you play as a hoard nation and sometimes hoards seem to have a six sense for where you are moving your armies, and will constantly outrun your forces until your turn around or take enough losses then they won't stop hunting you until everything you love is destroyed.

Basically if you want a challenge this is the game for you, i've never really lost a campaign on any other total war, but my first playthrough as the Huns led to a civil war where i was hunted down and slowly eliminated cultivating in a last stand just outside constantinople.

4,17228475,english,"900+ hours of my life lost… My fault but here’s why:

It's easy to pick holes or criticise something, as human beings it’s in our nature. We always will have a portion of our brain that tells us that ‘something’ could be done better… And it’s with the awkward wisdom of hindsight I begin my two pennies of thought on this latest ‘Total War’ release. For those who have never played a Total War game before, I do apologise in advance for not being concise enough for a balanced review or completely detailed report.

I’ve always been an avid fan of the growing database that controls CA’s Total War series that was first launched with the original ‘Shogun – Total War’. Although I have to admit, from a solo player point of view the ‘Zerg’ style AI scripting that ensues throughout, seems to ruin things for an overall strategy game. By this I mean, it’s ‘no’ matter how you start, the end is the same when it comes to the final push. This is hugely lame and in my individual opinion, is a shining example of how bad some game designers are in employment or more so, over-paid Producers (For the record, I worked at various gaming publishers and can name quite a few that ‘should’ have never have been employed in such a role – utterly clueless to gaming – “Apologies for the rant, but it is relevant”). 

For my part, the only way to scale a strategy game in difficulty is to simply incur penalties to the roll of a die or likewise incur penalties for ‘bad’ decisions – a simple mathematical notion but for a game, it is a rewarding dynamic of randomness. But after 900 hours+ on Attila, 700 hours+ (Total War – Rome 2) and an insane (according to Steam) – and I really hate to publish this fact. Although I think many hours were because the PC was left on overnight *coughs* – 3800+ hours on Total War – Shogun 2. I have to come to an eventual and final conclusion, “Complete waste of time”.

The combat on field is great fun; UI is good, graphics, sound and so on. All detailed, rewarding and completely atmospheric. Hard to fault and mainly because it’s almost as good as it gets on that front. The complete and utter jewel in the crown of the entire series and lead to many a late night of “Just one more…”. And to be honest, I don’t think even the hardiest gamer could be bored with the thrill of detailed RTS (Real Time Strategy) battles.

But you’re left feeling divorced from your 20 minute+ achievements when taken back to the ‘real’ part of the game – i.e. the ‘Campaign Map’. Rather than feel like a conqueror, you’re simply adding to your invisible foe’s strengths – even when using agents and so on. When you push, they push back and more – no matter what your style or tactics in play. In the end, your achievements in Attila (and the recent Total War games) are very counterproductive. 

So if you don’t care about gaming and just want a laugh – buy it. Play it and I dare say in 2-Player mode it’s probably the best in a turn based with RTS/Strategy you could find. But for a solo player, I would rather be sat in a prison cell with a deck of cards, with each card being the same colour/suit.

PS: Funny how most ‘professional’ game reviewers come up with the same scores… Having worked alongside many publishers in the UK during the 90’s, I’ve always wondered how they can tell the difference between their mouths and arses. Both portals seem to produce the same excrement when priced in wealth and insight.

PPS: Warhammer in CA’s hands – yeaaaah riiiight… Nice GFX I bet, but RPG/Roll of a die gameplay? You may as well handle dog poo and make a sandwich without washing your hands, and see if the randomness of picking up something ‘horrible’ is more prevalent than the £40+ bundle that is edging it’s way to the Steam Store soon…

21,17140866,english,"I won't get down to the nitty gritty on this review, but I'll point out the strong and weak points that I personally see in Attila and try not to rant on in overemphasized detail and repetition. I'll try to keep it as simple and as short as I can.


I haven't been on the Total War bandwagon for very long, I've only played since Rome 2 (over 1k hours between Rome 2 and Attila so far), but I've been an avid strategy lover and RTS player for my entire gaming life (2 decades). Games like Total War and others like Star Craft and so on... I won't go into detail on that or  make a list that gets off subject... My point is, is that I know a good strategy game when I see it, when it comes to all of the necessary elements and defining aspects that make an RTS or other strategy game a strategy game. Attila, in this aspect, is a great game.... but it is far from flawless for what it is and in comparison to it's earlier predecessors.... lets begin....


AI AND DIFFICULTY:

Attila is an improvement on Rome 2 in many ways, and one such way is the AI itself. The AI is much smarter (though the AI has always struggled and had a myriad of flaws since the beginning of the Total War series), but as long as it is a vast improvement on Rome 2 in this aspect, I'm a happy guy. And it is certainly an improvement....

I've put in about 400 hours on Attila so far and I've yet to see a battle where the AI does absolutely retarded stuff like abandoning perfectly good and effective siege equipment in an assault to go charge the walls extremely early when they're still standing and well defended... I've yet to see the AI run around (or get stuck in one spot) with wall ladders in the middle of the field just letting itself get hammered by arrows.... I've yet to see the AI charge an entire army with just one overspread unit (doesn't even break formation, which is the only point in this that I see)... I've yet to the AI abandon a siege that it's about to win (or is at least currently winning) for no freaking reason at all.... I've yet to see the AI in Attila do a number of absolutely retarded things that it did in Rome 2, and for this, Attila is definitely a welcomed improvement. Now the AI still does questionable things regularly, but at least they're only questionable instead of outright stupid and ridiculous! This is acceptable to me and most people, as patches and future DLC will always polish this up. Overall, the AI is pretty good for what is expected in a Total War game.

The difficulty is also a good improvement. In Rome 2, as far as actual AI intelligence, strategical implementation, and diplomatic involvement were concerned, the game stopped getting HARD at the actual hard difficulty level... The only thing that Very Hard and Legendary did was throw in unrealistic and random diplomatic penalties and ridiculous buffs to the AI so that it was over powered... but the AI itself was still just as retarded, still just as unadaptive, and still just as bugged.... it was awful. Because of the unrealistic and unfounded diplomatic penalties and AI buffs on VH and L difficulty, I never played them once discovering this, because it took away from the realism of the game for the sake of making it harder in stupid ways that don't make any sense in a game based on historical accuracy and realism...

Now this still works the same way in Attila, it's a game and there's only so many ways that they can make it harder as you get to VH and L difficulty. However, it's actually balanced now, and I personally have noticed a more intelligent AI when you get to these levels (though not very much). So now, there's somewhat of a point to playing on VH and L difficulty if you're looking to keep the realism and historical accuracy somewhat in tact.

All in all, in comparison to Rome 2's AI (though Attila is using the same engine I might add), Attila is a vast improvement and actually a challenging game without being utterly ridiculous and unrealistic in order to do so. This is a very welcomed change.


GRAPHICS:

The Graphics are largely the same as they were in Rome 2. I personally don't see too much of a difference other than polishes and minor tweaks and minor improvements. Oddly enough: though there is hardly any real significant improvements to the actual graphics quality and rendering, Attila is way less smooth than Rome 2 is. Attila on Ultra settings performs noticeably worse than Rome 2 on Ultra settings (pointing out again that there is little difference between the two); so the performance SHOULD be about the same..... but it's not.

All in all, if you played Rome 2 and got well aquainted with its aesthetics, don't go into Attila expecting something spectacular and greatly improved...... because it's simply not there.


DESOLATION:

The whole desolation option is awesome, simply because it was a real tactic that was used back then (though only in the right circumstances and by certain ruthless cultures). Adding in a new and additional real life tactic was a nice refreshment...... However, there is one downside to it: Factions that aren't even hordes, or who were never even known to use such tactics OVERUSE this option like a crack addict!!! In my grand campaign right now, half of the total of unoccupied land is desolate... when I discovered Greece (playing as Geats), ALL of it was desolate... It's a great new tactic and feature, but it is extremely imbalanced and the AI just doesn't use it reasonably at all. 

One of the biggest reasons for going to war in this age (or at all in human history for that matter) was to conquer and gain land! Not just destroy the entire earth by burning every single thing you conquered.... only very few in history have done that, but everybody else actually wanted to gain something from their conquests, and destroying everything simply renders that impossible and pointless.... There needs to be A LOT of new logic algorithms and action-set-rules added to this feature and the AI to make it what it should be. But as of right now, it's just awful and half of my empire has been gained by just resettling desolate regions...... how fugging boring and downright retarded is that.....


FACTIONS:

There aren't as many playable factions in Attila (YET) as there were in Rome 2, but in total there are just about as many (guestimating, not using real figures here). Attila still has a ton of factions to play with, and unless you do nothing with your life but play this game, there's no way you could do a grand campaign with every faction.... please, go do something with yourself like everybody else... get outside. go meet people. go eat something. please. for the love of God.

Yes, I think the option to play as any faction should be there don't hear what I'm not saying... I just think that if you already have a handful of factions that you want to play as already, that there's not really a big deal if some others aren't available..... unless again, all you do is play this game and you have some crazy goal to play a grand campaign as every faction that exists or something.... please go do something with yourself.... please. because nobody else will do that... You're one of the few, if not the only one that will.


DLC:

Though some of it is ""meh...."" at least CA hasn't been near as money grabbing with this game as they were with Rome 2 (at least yet anyway)! Somebody is trying to keep their greed in check it seems, and for that, I applaud you. Just keep it up, don't ruin it please. Try releasing a free DLC every now and then like CDRedProjekt!!! They're definitely doing it right.


OTHER:

I'm running out of characters so I'll end this here.... Largely, Attila isn't a far cry from Rome 2 or any other Total War game. You just have a different time period, new diplomacy elements, small story elements in the grand campaign, vastly improved AI and battle mechanics, return of the family tree, new post-battle options, hordes, and that's about it.

   + Game value for money - I've yet to finish a campaign. The Irish hordes take a little while longer to get around the place than the rest, with my tentative alliance with the British and the Saxons, who knows where the next few weeks will take me. So yeah, length wise. Value for money guaranteed. 

   + The actual fighting - I can manually aim my catapults and explode entire legions of troops. That's how to make me happy. Although you can't have asymmetric battles still. What if I have an odd number of friends CA? (I do and I either take an AI or two versus one)

Now onto the factions........

They are few, they have few units.... they are boring...... 
That sums up the factions besides playing as the hordes.
Now with the game it it current state I give it a 6/10. But one of our loyal Mod community memebers was able to remake the game into something playable. 

Terminus Total War. If you buy Attila don't waste any money on the DLC go stright to the steam workshop and get this mod. Makes Atill go from a 6/10 to a 10/10. This mod is not hisotricly accurate. So if you hate that don't get it, but if you love more factions (for free) New factions (for FREE) and revamed units (for FREE) get this mod. It will change you game expicence.

So here is the game rating in my opinion

Mod=10/10

The graphics look wonderful, detail fills the eye, the special abilities for the generals are cool, the fight scenes with the upgraded Blood and fire look amazing, but the game play is mind numbingly frustrating, 

First, the overall strategy is unmanageable, even if you have a giant empire to protect and prevent from rebelling you are limited to only having a few armies due to the fact a general is needed to create and move any military unit, so the strategy of proportioning your forces out across the map for strategy or tactical purposes has suddenly gone from the game and you will always have area's that are virtually undefendable.

All settlements without a general have only 4 of the same units, so all you have is a few generalled armies to move and fight with instead of dozens like previous games, stopping rebelling settlements by just increasing the number military units is no longer an option, making it almost impossible to control a large empire.

The difficulty level doesnt make the enemy better at strategy or more relentless, it just makes your money run out faster so you cannot survive against massively superior enemy forces, pointless. The system of diplomacy is better but building and Espionage seems redundant compared to the previous versions, and who wants to spend mental energy meddling with domestic political and family affairs, when your playing a game for realistic  War strategy?

Speaking of which, why do all units highlighted in a group suddenly break their existing formation to make a long line formation when you make them move forward? sometimes they keep formation if the highlighted units are grouped but sometimes even then they still do it, when they do, game over for any strategy you previosly had.

To make that worse, the double click on a unit to group all units of that type has gone, so you have to click every single unit to change all their abilities at the same time, fine if you play on easy, you can just pause it, click all units then unpause, but for a TW fan of days old, that loves the challenge of playing on the best strategy the AI can muster this is hard to enjoy,

 
I am more than a little disappointed, it is sad to see the new game has lost so much that made the old games great, and guys, whats with the charging extra money to play factions that should have already been in the original game?

I think its back to the old Medieval 2 and Empire drawing board with the gameplay and challenge level, make the next ones more about war strategy and using multiple areas of art of war, rather than manipulating and manouvering around pointless Domestic events, and take the time to make a complete game before releasing it, so people don't have to pay to play the main factions featured in it.",1436686461,1436686461,False,2,0,0.488522112369537354,0,True,False,False,76561198013928738,6,1,2202,0,1870,1468036811,,

62,16938145,english,"I love total war games, owned every one since Medieval. But try as i might i just can't like this installment. Its well put together, combat is still pretty solid and unlike in Rome 2 calvary is actually useful. But somehow through minor tweaks they have ruined several major mechanics. The game absolutely hates large empires and you will incur major penalties the larger you get. Public order is incredibily difficult to maintain and wipespread revolt is inevitable not to mention disease which once you get is basically impossible to contain or remove. So if the game doesn't want you to go big does it perhaps want you to play as the titular character and faction? Well as far as i can see no, no it goddamn doesn't. Being a mobile based civilisation is a pretty cool idea but you will be hemorraging funds right off the bat so you either reduce your horde (no-longer badass) to a size where you will die the first civilisation you try to conquer or you have to exist in a constant state of war. Which does make sense for the huns but your hordes eat more than you'd believe and if you have more than one horde in a region you'll start to starve.  And most regions have armies large enough to repel a single horde.You will lose far more men to hunger and lack of pay that to actual fighting. Historically acurate yes, fun no. The game really hobbled my fun by upping the unit upkeep. I bought this game with vision of mighty million man hordes sweeping all from in front of me but you'd be lucky to be able to sustain three armies. So my mighty Attila ended up an empaciated beggar in outer monglia hunted to the ends of the earth by a handful of goths. Pretty pathetic. 

I'm sure if you can get the hang of this its pretty fun but every time i start to get lost in the immersion my awesome armies collapse under their own weight. 

So to sum it up. 
Negative
Unit upkeep is too expensive, hordes eat too much, empire penalties are stupid, sieges take too long, most units from most factions look the same, hardest total war to date.
Positive
Burning mechanics are fun, raze mechanics are fun, its nice to have female units mixed in.

84,16880537,english,"Definitely one of the best TW titles released yet, CA heard all the criticism that they got from Rome 2 and Improved Attila at every level.

The difficulty level is great for a total war game since it's the first time where the late game is actually somewhat challenging.

The AI is definitely improved from the other games, with the turn based strategy elements being really good, family trees are back, politics are improved, city building requires planning and strategy if you want to keep a good economy.

My only real complaint would be the lack of cultural variety, but that's more of a side effect of the era the game is set in than anything else (Germans everywhere and all) 

Of course, there's a lot of DLCs (which seem to be one of the reasons a lot of people are not recommending the game, together with Rome 2 atrocious launch) but they are better than the DLC in the previous games, Both Longbeards  and Celts add 3 factions each being distinctive enough to be worth the price, I wouldn't really recommend Viking Forefathers unless its on sale, but the factions it adds are still fun enough to play, at this time I still don't own the Last Roman campaign pack, so I can't really comment on it.

This game takes a somewhat new playing style as you can become nomads and become hordes instead of occupying citites. This was absolutly fun and generally enjoyed the new style. Could they have done better with the idea? Yes, but otherwise it is still decent and I enjoyed the game and will continue to play it. The armies in this game though look ugly, some like the celts look like they were thought of in 5 seconds by simply slapping PJ's onto them and giving them a sword and shield, but we do have the option for mods to change the armies but they still could have put more effort into character customization. They have also brought back the family tree which is great. My first experiance with this was during Total war : Shogun and i really enjoyed the idea of managing your family and other parties as well on a much larger scale. The map in the game is the same size of TW Rome 2 but i felt it was smaller ( Possibly due to less cities or just my view?) Anyways through, it was absolutly fun to explore and upgrade towns as in other total war series. 
This game was and still is very fun to play, although I am still a little disappointed in CA for making DLC of other factions that other people could easily make mods for and Same with the Last Roman pack, a decent modder would be able to make it, that content should have been free or at a much greater reduced price than $8 and selling it as Day 1 DLC. So this shows they did have them completed before the release of the game, same with the blood and gore DLC like WTF? seriously? Does CA think they can sell already inside the game content for $?

If you're more hungry for a decent Total War game than you are bitter towards Sega, get it.

[h1]Busniness Practices[/h1]
This game solidifies the fact Rome 2 was a beta for another Empire to Napoleon type of release. Yes, its a good game overshadowing the old glorified beta of a game but this type of game development is plainly dispicable along with its day 1 faction DLC. Also it isn't as though the Saxons don't exist, so unless you really want to start as one of three tribes up in Denmark you may as well skip the DLC until a steep 75% sale.

[h1]Improvements[/h1]
Now, to the actual meat. Visually its far superior, even simple things like arrow types look distinct. Political and family management is actually a thing, not just some set of percentages as in Rome 2. Maps especially like cities are far less constricting and easier to move around in, they're also plainly better in design. 

Cities aren't just plots of dirt to capture, they can actually be burnt down and you can even migrate as a horde; by choice or after your last settlement has been destroyed. Though easily I find being a horde far more interesting than being stuck playing the typical empire management game. Its just so much easier to fund your faction when your cities are part of an army.

The Good:

Diverse Faction: The factions break down essentially into Roman, Barbarian, Eastern, and Steppe. These various groups also break down deeper depending on which faction you choose. I love this part of the game, it is always nice to feel like you are playing not just a faction but as a people with unique traits and units. 

Really Hard: This game will challenge you, it throws all kinds of twists and turns that make it one of the most challenging TW games out there.


The Bad: 

Impossible to fully ""win"": Eventually in all TW games you can reach a point where you are ""good"". This is the point where you have put hours and hours into the game to finally reach that point where your cities and towns are happpy, you have a large army, and you are well established, that is never the case in this game. Towards the end of my WRE campaign(probably the hardest IMO) I started reaching a point where I would actually hit this point, I had killed Atilla, pushed back the barbarians and even subjugated a few and made them powerful allies, I felt pretty good about where my Empire was going, and then it happened, the game told me I achieved a minor campaign victory and the next turn everyone rebelled against me and my Empire crumbled, I angrily watched as everything I built went crashing down upon itself for no reason whatsoever, this sort of thing has happened several times to the point where I've reached a conclusion, the game will always do this, I then lost any desire to play this game. 

Late game penalties: There are far to many late game penalties for becoming ""strong"", if you look at your power rating it's actually more beneficial to stay weak then become powerful, you suffer in the long run.

Razing settlements is awful: Razing a settlement is only good if you are a horde and even then it's problems make it annoying at best for every settlement based faction, it is basically causing chaos within the games world.

To much emphasis on creating problems: I realized that most of the goals in this game involve surviving if you are settlement based or destroying if you are a horde, the horde factions I played as I saw to many disadvantages to becoming settled and so I just raided to my hearts content, never actually finding a need to ever settle. 


Conclusion:
I love TW, I will continue to buy TW but this game gave me no satisfaction at all, most TW games are challenging but give me the satisfaction of becoming a great leader late game while knowing that during the tough early or mid game moments that's what I have to look forward to, I've realized with this game that is not the case. If you are a veteran TW player this game will have you enjoying the new features while hating the impossibility of victory, you should prepare for a long campaign with many ups and downs, but always an eventual down. If you are new to TW play something else, the original Rome 2 Total War that this is based off of was wonderful and there are also some older games that will have you wanting more, but this one? Nah. 

UPDATE: I had decided that my review may have been unfair due to being based off of a single campaign, I decided to play around on a few others, my conclusion? I love it.

Why? Because while the WRE campaign is extremely hard there are other campaigns that are incredibly fun, picking a Norse faction will allow you to simply run around the map raiding other territories in a horde or based out of a city, I raided town after town before setting up an empire based in various towns and port cities around the map, using these to launch raids against major factions that were breaking down. 
I also tried the WRE campaign with a mod or two, the mods make it a lot easier to manage the tough campaign. I would also recommend playing as the ERE before the WRE to get used to managing a large empire as it is quite a bit easier. 

At the end of the day this game was in fact designed to be incredibly hard end game but after playing some other factions I've realized that this is in fact a great addition to the TW series and makes me excited for their next installment, Warhammer: TW

Note: This is my own opinion, feel free to message me if you have questions or would like to discuss the game, or tactics that I used, also I would recommend watching Warrior of Sparta videos as he is pretty good at recommending strategies to use for this game.",1429982812,1435756558,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198005377769,56,6,55269,0,12565.0,1600629779,,

One thing that does grate however is the ending razing by the Huns of anything they come across - though I suppose that this is realistic. A total lack of cities in provinces doesn`t mean no one lives there - it`s just in games terms that there`s nothing worth going there for unless you plan on a total rebuild of the province.

Still - Attila dies eventually, and realistically, the hordes do fade eventually.

6,16819887,english,"There's been an influx of dumb reviews on here because of the free weekend, so I thought I'd counter one of them at least. Most of what I have here is the same you would read elsewhere, but Attila is frankly, one of the best games in the series, and doesn't deserve a 'mixed' rating regardless of how you feel about DLC. This is a review of the game, not of the publisher's policies. 

The Good:
-The atmosphere is fantastic, they set out from the beginning to give the setting an appropriately apocalyptic feel, and they succeeded handily. The climate changes will have you scrambling for food, an enemy razing your settlement will piss you off, and the Huns will kick in your shit if you're not prepared for them. Generally speaking, you'll more time surviving than thriving.

-The new mechanics are well done, and add just enough variety to the old formula, and just enough difficulty. Migrating and abandoning cities makes for unique game experience, and gives factions the kind of open-ended flexibility they've never had otherwise. Equipment on characters is a small addition that adds simple, welcome customization. Integrity hasn't ever really been a factor in my games, but I like the idea. And razing the home of a particularly hated enemy is always satisfying.

-There is more variety in the campaign experience among the factions than in any other game. Obviously the migrators will be different than the established kingdoms, but the Huns will also be very different from the migrators who are obviously looking to settle. The enormous but crumbling Western Roman Empire will be very different from the large but flourishing Sassanid empire, with the Eastern Romans splitting the difference. And of course there is the more traditional start-with-one-province-and-go-from-there route, but several of them even have an emphasis on raiding that is at odds with the usual objective of expanding at the expensive of all else. The Celtic factions are worth mention too, their stuff tends to have subpar stats, but have the ability to 'guerrilla' deploy essentially anywhere on the battle map.

-The politics system is vastly improved from Rome II's strangely abstract system. For one thing the family tree is back, and the prestige/loyalty system makes for another fairly straightforward (but challenging) aspect to balance along with everything else. Everything from securing the loyalty of a general to extorting a family member can be accomplished by 'spending' the prestige earned throughout the campaign, but family members using this prestige shifts the balance of power to effect things like the integrity of your armies as well as the public order modifiers across all your provinces. 

-It's one of the harder Total Wars, generally speaking. There are more little details to keep track of on the world map, but they never feel overwhelming once you get used to them. The climate and Huns make for a challenging end game, but thankfully they don't feel like such a cheap gimmick as realm divide did in Shogun 2.   

The Bad:
-Yes, it has DLC. Yes, day one DLC is bullshit. I hate it too, but this is the world we live in now, and it's not going anywhere. I don't know if they held back content from the base game to sell later, but the base game never feels 'incomplete' for the lack of any of the factions added since the release. If you desperately want to play as Celts, go ahead and pay for them. If you just kind of want to play as Celts, wait a few weeks and get them at 50% off, and if you have no interest at all don't pay for them at all. The base factions provide a tremendous variation in the experiences they bring without any help, so you probably won't feel obliged to buy any more anyway.    

-The optimization is pretty bad, and it sounds like CA isn't too concerned with it. I play on a toaster and have never been too concerned with my how high my graphics setting are, but people with high end rigs are having trouble keeping up the fps on just highish settings. 

-At this point it's still just The Western European Show. Between the base factions, the first 3 culture packs, and our first free LC the focus has almost entirely been on the Celtic/Germanic cultures. Where are the Moors? The Berbers? The Slavs? Axum? Maybe some Roman Britons for a different Roman experience? The Sassanids are swimming in satellite nations. I hope the eastern and African regions getting some love is just a matter of time, it might take the potential 'rise of Islam' campaign til we get much of that though.

-It's probably not the Total War to enter the franchise with. I'd mentioned it's on the harder side for the franchise (minus Sassanids, they're crazy easy) and there are more small mechanics to learn and balance in a campaign, so unless the time period really appeals to you or you have a friend you want to coop with, I'd say try an older game first.",1435717917,1435717917,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198026631115,109,1,30048,0,3050.0,1582596795,,

Attila feels like a different game.  Has a lot of the same concepts of Rome II, but also a lot of new dynamics.  The family tree is back and you have to do a lot of internal diplomacy to be effective.  Tech tree is also new and you now have to pay to research some of the high level techs.  I used to have a couple of  provinces dedicated to recruiting troops with all the armour, weapon, and other upgrades in a province while the others provided support (food, money, research).  That doesnt work as well now since even if your empire is producing enough food, provinces get penalties if you don't have enough local food.  The spies, champions, and dignitaries are not as powerful and a different leveling system.  The whole food and disease balance also make you plan a bit different.  Not enough sanitation and you keep getting hit by disease. 
Overall, I am enjoying it a lot.  If you are a fan of the franchise, I say buy it.  A lot of people are upset at the shameless nickle and diming with the DLCs.

If you playing hoping conquest alone will win you the game, then you have already lost, even though you may win every battle you have to go out of your way to do things that your playing style may not normally lead too, just to statisfy some article concept of victory. 

Mean while you may be ruler of the galaxy, all foes bow before you and the game still does not consider you the winner.

The razing of towns feature seems like a novel idea at first until you realise the strongest AIs have literally laid waste to the whole of Europe. Leaving only a tiny number of towns left to conquer. Less than many victory conditions demand you raid and loot in fact.

Which makes it even harder to achieve any victory conditions when all the towns are razed before you even find them. You end up rebuilding them and hoping an AI will capture it without razing it so you can raid it back to forefil a victory condition.

The GUI also is a little confusing and not that well laid out, a lot is hidden in deeper menus leaving you guessing where everything is. 

Then we have the family tree and positions within a clan (Playing as Celts). All this appears to do is cause family to revolt. The game does not explain this side of the game very well at all and leaves you guessing. I find it more of an annoyance than a game feature worth having.  Needing to assign family to different parts of the clan's hierarchy is not fun or interesting the first time you have to do it. So having to do it every few turns gets old pretty much immediately.

Played a few customs battles at first, still don't understand why fire ships are even in the game yet alone available for every other faction. So Navalbattles are a bit better from Rome 2 but still not up to  Shogun 2 (in my opinion), which were awesome. From what I played the land battles were pretty good, the Ai still  short of a few chromosomes served it's purpose well although still made questionable if not down right retarded descisions sometimes but this is nothing really new to total war. The campaign: First campaign I played as the Saxons despite having very weak starting units, was having a good time until the romans showed up with 4 full stacks to conquer my terriritoires. I was forced to allope with my two remaining armies when it became clear this was a fight a cannot win. Sailed to Britannia to start anew however the romans followed me there and so the saxons passed into annuals of history. Lesson learned try not to so close to the romans. Second go I tried the Huns. Now this was fun! The Horde mode was easily the best part of this campaign for me. Moving across the map raiding and sacking settlements, until the other factions got fucked of with me and drove me back east into syria which was no mans land. Ended camping out at the edge of the map with two hordes to the north and two to the south, east of the balck sea, trying to build up my ecomony and armies for round 2. However 2 factions decided to pursue me. Although quite fun at first as there settelment were provinces away, I imangined angry generals with desires to avenge the plundered settlements and fallen comrades chasing the savage hoards across distant lands in order to wipe them out once and for all. However the quickly became irksome as after defeating the first waves, they continued to send more after me, one stack at a time. Quickly losing all immersion as they were just throwing away men when they had other wars closer to home to worry about. 

So for campaign horde mode was fun. Making regions desolate also fun but the Ai does take the piss. Family trees being back and being able engage in faction politics with them is also great. 

Downsides: All the unecessary streamlining and streamlining is back :(. Restricted armies still not understanding why I can't split my army in order to surround a smaller force. Yes I get that having a named army which can level up is cool (especially when you are naming your four hodes after the four horsemen :)). What about reinforcement column? In my medieval 2 campaigns I would be sending small forces out after conquering armies for the sole purpose of replenishing them after particulary harsh battles or sieges. Bringing me on to another point; I wish CA would bring back the simple drag and drop for merging units. Province system and city building is the same as rome 2 which you may like but I thought was horrible, I think Shogun 2 went far enough on that one. Anyway my point behind this rant was, this is a strategy game and I hate that you are being restricted.


Now would I recomend this game? Yes when it goes on sale after all the DLC is out. Now the focus campaigns are fine, but faction DLC is and always will be bullshit! Selling a game piece by piece is fucking insulting, especially when in past games you could just unlock the factions. Not only that but it is really lazy, microtransactions (which what it basically amounts to) have no place in AAA gaming. How much work does it take to unlock a faction? Not very fucking much yet that's what it boils down to pay me and I will unlock them for you. Not create and add a new one to the game but unlock it!

- If you don't have [b]Rome 2[/b] buy that instead, it's much cheaper and offers the same (or even better) experience.
- If you have Rome 2 don't buy this there are very few new things in Attila (and atleast half of them are bad).


[b]The long story:[/b]
The concept of Attila is good, migrating hordes and desloated regions might sound appealing at first but they turn into an AI nightmare.

[u]Scorched earth[/u]:
In Attila most of the faction can chose to destroy a region instead of occupying it, this burns down everything and leaves it barren. Factions can also choose to abandon and burn down their own settlement or they can even choose to burn all of ther settlements and become a migrating faction.

The problem with desolated regions is:
[list]
    [*]They are never ever repopulated by the AI (even though they can settle there for free). 
    [*]Repopulation costs a lot of money for the player. Just taking a desolate region costs more than making a full stack army and after that you still have to reconstruct the buildings (for tons of money).
    [*]Even if you got the money, it's not worth the time. When you take a desolate land you have to start rebuilding it, but in order to rebuild you first have to wait for the population to grow, so it takes 30-40 turns to make it a normal settlement again.
[/list]

[u]From my Saxon campaigns[/u]: I built my little empire then Attila's horde arrived, I beat them back so they decided to turn against the rest of the world resulting in pretty much every region east of Poland and north of the Black Sea to become desolate. That's a lot of barren regions... never to be repopulated.

My allies The Gates owned skandinavia, with 4 regions and 5-6 full stack armies. One day they got bored (or maybe winter was coming) so they burned down all their settlements and became a migrant faction. Then they sailed down to the beaches of Spain but they never landed. For the rest of the game they were roaming the sea with 5 full stack armies.

- The conquered: remember when you conquered all the settlements of a faction but they still had an army roaming around (and annoying you) for a short time before it withered away. Well in Attila they don't wither away, instead they become a migrant faction and run to the other corner of the world to roam around there doing nothing. This is pointless and from that moment on the faciton is just taking up loading time.

- The enemy: In one of my campaigns the Celtic factions became allies and counquered Spain (they did this quite often actually). I figured it's time to take their homeland so I went to war with the four factions there, I landed in Britain with 4 armies and started taking their regions. 
To my surprise they reacted quite fast and I noticed 13 full stack armies (of the 4 enemy factions) heading up from Spain by boat. 
I was glad, this will be total war and I'm probably going to get my ass kicked in glorious battles. Unfortunately after 3 turns two of the factions just stopped near the French coast and started roaming the seas there. The rest arrived to Britain with 7 armies but they didn't land. They waited there for atleast 10 turns and after that only one started attacking me.

[b]The Ai[/b]
[list]
    [*]A lot of times the Ai doesn't attack when he should, he just camps near the enemy settlements doing nothing. 
    [*]The way the Ai conqueres regions or starts wars is beyond any reason. Factions at two different corners of the map start a war with each other.
    [*] Ai is reluctant to attack other Ai regions when they are at war. Even if he has wastly superior numbers (I'm talking about 3 full stacks vs an undefended settlement, the stacks just camped in the region for 20+ turns and then go away)
    [*]A lot of armies just roam around pointlessly. Often they go to the sea and just sail around doing nothing and never landing aigan.
[*] The desolate regions is abused by the Ai.
[*] Small factions that should have just died out roam around pointlessly as migrant faction.  
[/list]
Thes are just the Campaign ai things, the battle ai is pretty much the same as in Rome 2.

[b]All in all[/b] Attila is a bit like Napoleon was to ETW, a ""should have been"" expansion.  Except while in Napoleon the engine was really improved compared to ETW, in Attila there are only insignificant changes compared to Rome 2.

35,16775752,english,"this is a statement as well as a review against the toxic fans of the total war community. As everyone knows Total War and CA have been absolutely hammered of late by its fans. This all started with the disaster of a release of Rome 2, at that moment all the fans started to hate on it and continued to do so even now, even though Rome 2 is completely fixed of problems loads of content and is probably one of the best Total War games i have ever played in my 11 years of total war. Anyway so since Rome 2 has been fixed less people hate on it for its original problems except if they havent played the game since launch, or if they are deluded people who seem to somehow think Rome 1 is a better game then Rome 2 when Rome 1 is very buggy and is unhistorical to the extreme.  besides these people a new way to continue the peopular hate movement against CA is its DLC policy. i agree that some DLC were not needed like the unit packs but otherwise rome 2 has 4 full fledged expansion adding tons.  not many people complained about Rome 2 DLC ad you would think BUT ATTILA......OH ATTILA

there are 5 DLC. 5. thats it. theres like maybe 1 more coming. and people are hating Attila like Never before even though  other game series like CIV and all the paradox games like crusader kings 2 are so stuffed with DLC its hilarious  yet no.....the total war fanbase instead ignores that and thinks they are hard done by. WRONG the total war fanbase is one of the most spoiled rotten toxic communties of late that i have ever seen. I remember the days of TWC forums being a great place to talk about a great game series. now it is filled with Sheep following the cult of the total war hate. Like why? why would you log on and waste your life to just hate ona  product.???? total wars games have more hours and more content then most games ever have. So i warn you people if you dont like toxic communties better stay away from Total War then, or at least dont talk to them.

ANYWAY onto the Review:

Attila is a odd game for me... it is clearly barbarian invasion 2  but with loads of new featurres as well as stuff ported over from rome 2. the games graphics are beautiful and the moddeling is second to none. However the game is extremely hard. If you thought it was hard to manage cities in rome 2 with disorder wait till you see this game. immigrants, refugees, climate change all stuff with you as well as sanitation create a more in depth city management then ever before BUT it also makes it insanly hard to even do so. The ai cheats i feel as well sadly it frustrates me to no end when all these 1 region owning factions can support 2-3 armies while you can own 5 regions and only support 1. not to mention you have to constantly garrison armies because your civil disorder is almost always plumeting. Battles in this game feel rather fast paced and very number based. the generic rock paper sissors gameplay similar in shogun 2 but more evident. however i feel this actually detracts from game immersion in rome 2 seeing a elite unit of swordsmen fighting units that are designed to kill them but fighting to noble death was really immersive and exciting. wherass in Attila cavalry kills infantry doesnt matter if they are elite and seasoned veterans. 

however the many factions budding mod workshop support and constant multiplayer community does help this game stand up.  But i very much recommend Rome 2 over this game. only get this if you are done with Rome 2 and all its DLC and want to continue the experiance

This game does not have any of the problems that plagued Rome 2 at launch (I would know I preordered that piece of garbage) but it didn't offer me a ""wow"" experience. In other words it was neither bad nor good. The only quantitative improvements I saw were: Greatly improved user interface, unit cards are back, and skill/technology/family trees. 

This game was fun for a few hours but after I got bored and went back to my Radious Rome 2 campaign. I even had 17 hours left on the free trial yet I still didn't boot it up. Here's the thing, this game is a glorified DLC expansion pack for Rome 2. Nothing about this game stands out and makes you say ""Man I got to get this for $33 bucks!"". The campaigns are boring, 1/4 of the factions are piecemealed as DLC, The AI cheats (The Huns hunt you and you alone), the Roman factions are pathetically weak, and once again CA's latest Total War has no soul in it. It's just a grind really. 

As it stands this game is DLC for Rome 2. Think of it as ""Barbarian Invasion 2, HD version"". If it was $15-20 with all faction packs included then I would recommend it.

48,16769173,english,"I feel it's always bad to start a review with the conclusion, because it gives the appearance of bias, but this truly is a great game and exactly what I was hoping for out of the total war franchise. To be honest, there are so many things I love about it that I probably won't even get 'round to mentioning half of them. I'll do my best:

After the backlash from the fanbase against Rome II, you can really tell that CA have taken the criticism to heart and have developed everything the fanbase suggested. The politics is transparent, deep but most importantly engaging. After Rome II I had forgotten just how immersive the family tree was. This game brings it back to total war roots again and leaves you with ""just one more turn"" syndrome. Arranged marriages, assassinations, grabs for internal power, discrediting popular figures and castrating (really) disloyal faction members.

Personally, it's my favourite time-period for many reasons, not just the fact that the Visigoths are playable; obviously that is a more subjective point. For many wanting a medieval game, this gets pretty close as the tech tree expands pretty far beyond the supposed time frame of the game. This ensures that there is continual development of your faction and makes it feel more realistic. One thing I have noticed is that the soundtrack to one of my favourite TV series, Vikings, fits PERFECTLY with every moment of this game (seriously, give it a try, it's uncanny).

A great development in the franchise is the introduction of more survivalist strategy features. Attila represents the apocalypse, and while the huns are a formiddable, aggressive faction who raze (a very cool strategic feature) the steppes leaving many desolate regions before Attila comes to power, once a dramatic cutscene cinematically introduces his rise to power, they really become a bit terrifying - you'll be hunched with your head in your hands each time you press end turn.

That's not to say they can't be reasoned with. The diplomacy of Attila is the strongest I've seen yet (although regions STILL can't be traded!) with a host of different features. The almost universal dislike of the western Roman empire means you can curry favour with most factions as a barbarian faction, or you can try and restore the empires to what they once were if you prefer suicide.

There's more customisation in almost all aspects, including being able to rename cities, and very transparent tech trees and attribute levels.

There are so many more positives than this, not forgetting to mention the generally gritty, apocalyptic and consistent atmosphere of the game as you battle disease, approaching hordes and ever harsher winters. Siege escalation and fire spreading in cities are really cool too!

It's only fair to mention a few gripes I have, though. The biggest one for me is that sieges are still a bit of a mess, I find them a bit frustrating. They're difficult for the wrong reasons. Even though the game is well balanced yet still diverse, it feels like there is always some 'cheat' the AI uses which results in unneccesary loss of life on my part. The AI improves marginally with each release, but the improvement in Attila is still marginal, but leaps and bounds more interesting and challenging than the AI in Rome II, even in the Emperor Edition.
Army compositions from the AI in campaign, at least the Romans, seems to be largely the same, which is a bit disappointing, but I have favourite compositions too so I can't judge too harshly. It would just be nice to see more of the large unit diversity in the game when battling the AI in campaign.
Graphically and performance wise, while the stills look excellent, there's considerable lag in battles when flying over units. That means I end up taking more of a strategic rather than cinematic view. It's a shame, but at the base level it's usually and indistinct mosh-pit, a result of most of the factions having similar colours (largely chainmail or gold&brown fabrics). However that's what mods are for, of which there are many.

In conclusion it is definitely worth picking up at some point. Owing to SEGA's business pracitices, get it and the DLC at a sale so that you don't feel like you are being exploited, but even if you pick it up at full price you'll quickly forget your spending guilt when you lose yourself in the complex and engaging campaign of Total War: Attila.

53,16767091,english,"This is my first Total War game, and overall I would say I am very happy with it.  

The Grand Campaign is challenging and fun if you play as either of the Roman factions or one of the many barbarian or steppe factions.  Unfortunately the only Eastern faction you can play as is the Sassanids, who don't really have any challenges at all.  The horde mechanic makes the barbarians and steppe factions very fun to play as, and makes defending against them a good challenge.  The fertility loss adds another layer of desperation to the campaign as all the ai factions rush toward the most fertile regions at once.  There have been several DLC faction packs, none of which I considered worth buying due to lack of interest in those factions and because many of them are pretty skimpy with making the factions very different from other barbarian factions.  If you are interested in them then I guess they would be worth it in a sale.  

AI seems pretty decent in the battle mode as well.  Depending on the army composition it attempts fairly advanced maneuvers, nothing amazing though.  On the defense it will react to your maneuvers and reorient appropriately and if it thinks it is in a poor position it moves to regain superior ground.  On the attack it is much less impressive and only tries to flank if it has cavalry, I guess that is due to it being forced to attack.  Naval AI is much less impressive, it is very easy to just kite them along with archer boats.  

The siege escalation mechanic is a neat way to simulate an extended siege against a city.  This makes it important to relieve cities that are under siege because the defenses can be broken down making the garrison very vulnerable.  The city maps in general are pretty good, the unique ones (Rome, Ravenna, Constantinople and Ctesiphon) are very fun to attack/defend as well as being pretty amazing just to look at.  

CA also released mod tools that let you do quite a bit with the game from fiddling with unit cards to creating new city maps.  Unfortunately there is only a very basic tutorial, but if you keep at it then it becomes pretty easy to figure out what to do, and there is a fairly active community that you can get help from.  

Negatives include the poor performance of the game, apparently it was designed for future GPU's despite being based on a game that is 2 years old and engine that is even older.  If you don't have a very high end computer then it will be slow and it will not look very good.  The tech trees for the Romans are also very stupid, the people at CA really subscribe to the Gibbons theory on why the Roman empire fell.  Right now they have techs that severely hurt their long term viability by removing sanitation and public order buildings from being built.  Also it is very annoying and downright stupid how expensive upgraded units are.  They are not worth the slightly improved stats for how much more expensive they are.  Fortunately there are several mods that fix the latter problems so they are only an issue if you use the base game.  Really if you have any gameplay related qualms with the game then there is very likely a mod that fixes it.

I mean yeah, they did have 6 DLCs, but those DLCs were adding like 25+ more hours of content to an already great game. Total War: Attila has too many DLC. I will not pay $7.99 JUST TO HAVE BLOOD IN THE GAME! I know I'm not supposed to use another game in a review, but Europa Universalis + The Battles is the type of game we want. We want to be able to play every faction on the entire game map. We don't want to have to ****ing spend 42 F***ing dollars on a game that it won't make any difference on. Why not give all the DLC to us NOW and have an actually good game, and then use the DLC to actually make a HUGE DIFFERENCE on the game itself. Why can't CA understand this?

The actual gameplay itself isn't too bad. In comparison to EU4, it's the worst f***ing thing ever, but NO! This isn't a review for that game. I think the gameplay was terrible, what with the fact that there are OP people EVERYWHERE and not a single f***ing person in this f***ing continent can actually figure out how to use anything but Germanic Levys. I love Total War, and no, I'm not one of those major fanboys who has played it since it's first game, I started at Shogun II. That game was nice. I really enjoyed it. It gave me a sense that this series was actually good. but Rome II and Attila proved me the f*** wrong. Rome II was amazingly easy while Attila was amazingly just... fail. Don't get this game. It's not worth the $44.99 price tag. It's not worth $10. Go buy EU4 and throw Attila into magmaey pits of mount doom of which it was born. Eu4 without DLC is not AS good as with, but still go get it and abandon Attila.

6,16735209,english,"The Total War franchise has recently been surrounded in hatred with the disastrous release of Total War Rome II, while it's predecessor Shogun II was regarded as one of the greatest, if not the greatest, Total War title thus far. 

Now, onto the review. The first thing I say is - it is DEFINITELY an improvement over Rome II, not doubt in my mind. The two differ; In Rome II, it is about building your chosen nation to glory, whereas in Attila it is mainly about maintaining your empire in one of the most turbulent time periods in Europe's history.

On the topic of Attila himself. I have one tip - always try to destroy The Huns before Attila becomes ruler. Attila is born beginning of 400AD, and the game starts at 395AD and has 4 turns per year. If I'm correct you have 20 turns until Attila is born.

When he becomes ruler, boy, you are in trouble. He constantly spawns stacks that harrass the player, especially if the player chooses a Roman Faction. He is truly the Scourge of God.

The Western Roman Empire (or the WRE, referred from now on) is in a state of military and economic decline under Flavius Honorius Augustus. The empire is being attacked from all corners and civil unrest is everywhere. The WRE is severly overextended, and from turn one, nations declare war on them and destroy them.

I found the WRE didn't really succumb to the barbarian invasion, instead break-away nations such as Britain, Africa, Gaul or Hispania took over parts of the Empire. These nations are have the Roman culture, so Roman buildings, units and leaders. Overall I didn't feel like the WRE fell to barbarians, but to its rebels.

Onto the features I like:
Cities are unique; Londinium, Roma, Constantinople and Ctesiphon are just a few. You can now bust through the walls of the impenetrable Theodosian Walls and set fire to the Hagia Sophia (Even though the Hagia Sophia wasn't built until circa 500AD, under the reign of Justinian.) 
Improved combat.
Family trees.
Horde mechanics.
Dat Rome I menu like doe. 
Ect.

Now the negatives:
Diplomacy mechanics are identical to Rome II.
Faction panel still confusing.
Sassanids and Huns (when Attila is ruler) are op.
NO ATHENS! 

If you feel like you want a big faction that is easy, play the Sassanid Empire, not the Eastern Roman Empire! I made that mistake myself, and a couple of turns later the Visigoths took Constantinople and destroyed all of Greece.

TL;DR - The game has improved on Rome II, with cool new features. It, however, still has its flaws. Overall I would recommend this game.

SCORE - 85/100

25,16714908,english,"Before I start this review I will say that I do have the dlc for Atilla and that my experience with the game may differ from those who play the vanilla game. Also that I got the dlc on sale so it wasn't as much of an issue for me as it is for some other people who have problems with the culture packs.

The Vanilla Game.
Atilla at its core is a good game. There are countless new systems in place to help streamline and clean up some systems in Rome 2. The new technology system and naval battels are both improvements that I prefer much over the Rome 2 counter parts. The new horde mechanic is insanely fun. Being able to liberate the roman emprie and just be the biggest pest to them while trying to figure out where to eventually settle down was the most novel experience i have had in the series in years. The game is also more challenging than Rome 2. The slow desolation of europe and the coming of the Huns was hard to react to my first few games as I was trying to use my old insticts as a total war player. I know that many people do not like change and that many still look at medieval 2 as the best total war installment in the series and that it has been a slow decline since then. I disagree, I think total war is taking steps in new directions and is not afraid to take risks and reinvent sytems at the risk of upsetting their fans in order to make a better game ultimately. Atilla is in my opinion a great new entry into the series bringing back family trees and keeping the event systems from Rome. The added slow story telling mechanics of the campaign through the invasion of the huns and the almost unending winter added more challenges to an already assymetrical and challenging title. If for the only the base game I say Atilla is worth a buy especially if you can get it on sale because why not save your money :).

DLC 
Now I love the viking DLC It adds new factions that make conquering the vulnerable europe an entirely diferent experience especially since they get bonuses to winter conditions. The DLC culture packs add a lot of options to an already amazing game and are not necessary to enjoy Attilla but if you want a little extra oomf to your game the dlc made by creative assembly are always detailed and add hours of gameplay to an already vast choice of factions and decisions. Once again if you can get them on sale I would buy them. I dont know if I would recomend getting them without research though. There is no use purchasing factions you can't see yourself playing as. I love total war and bought all of them on sale but I do heavily recomend doing your research before just buying every culture pack. Buy the ones you think you would really enjoy because creative assemply dlcs are meant to add more playability and should be purchased to play more factions the way you want to play your game.

Final Verdict.
If you like Total war it is definatly a game to add to your collection and if you have been on the fence about Atilla and have Rome 2 I think its time to move onto the Fall of the Roman Empire and have new exeriences. It is a great game and if you put aside all the arguments of dlc at launch and a few fan disagreements with the way the mechanics have changed Its a damn fun game. Isn't that what games are suppossed to be about being fun and allowing to experience new things.

And not to mention the "" free DLC"" that is literally a copy pasted faction that has name changes. they literally copy pasted an entire faction and changed names. it really is sad. i had so much hope for this game.

46,16665127,english,"This is the game Rome 2 should have been. literally the only problem i have with it is the way the DLC is done.

GOOD:
-very detailed internal faction politics. you can generally keep things under control by spreading rumours about the people who you don't want to become powerful (and the occasional assassination)
-Rome 2's combat without the bugs. it's a good, reaslitic feeling system, and again, troops replenishing by themselves is the BEST thing (that was the only problem i had with medieval 2, my armies spent too long being rebuilt after battles- often literally years)
-More aggressive AI. you want to see a siege battle from the perspective of a defender? in R2 they didn't attack if i had even one extra unit inside the walls, but now i get to be on the defending side of some nice, interesting sieges. Also, they've improved town sieges with minor fortifications, so it's not just a battle with buldings in the way, it's a minor siege.
-The huns. i'm told playing as the Hun hordes is fun, but personally i really enjoyed playing as the saxons because of the looming threat of the incoming hordes. i had massive battles, and a turn where, over three battles, i killed attila, destroyed four hordes, and sent a fifth one running. Terrific fun.
-More varied events, more flavour to the game, and bonuses to go with your choices,
-GENERAL AND AGENT NOW HAVE VISIBLE UPGRADE TREES. no more guesswork, or waiting for the in-game wiki to load, it's all there in front of you. PRAISE JEEBUS.
-There's also a building guide which is quiker and easier to use than the in-game wiki. not the best UI for it, but it works and it's clear what it means.

BAD:
-you might not like the fact that you have to pay attention to internal politics. at first i found it to be a bit of a headache, and unnecessary busywork, but a few years in i'd got to grips with the major do's and dont's
-The DLC [Lest We Forget]
-Something about the economies of the one-town-factions lets them build up to two full stacks of units. unless you can take their city on your first turn, ignore them until far later in the game or you will cripple yourself fighting a number of troops you generally won't see other than from rome or the huns

TL:DR
This game is good. If you've played Rome 2, it's better than that. If you've not played total war before... start with the original rome, see if you like it. YOU DO NOT NEED THE DLC FOR THIS GAME. for example, if you want to play as one of the viking factions, but aren't so bonkers about it you're hesitation to spend the money, get the base game and try the saxons.",1435111127,1435111127,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198017728351,233,23,24822,0,4199.0,1524489383,,

63,16568737,english,"Attila plays like a more fun version of rome 2, where you feel like you actually have to conquer new territory, or you will perish. This contrasts rome 2 in that you feel like you are constantly in danger of being destroyed, while in rome 2 you kind of just sit around wondering who to attack next. In Attila you are forced to be more aggressive, and the feeling tension it brings to the campaign map as well as the battle field is welcomed. However, for many of the positive things Attila brings to the table, there are plenty of negative decisions. 

Pros: 
-Siege battles are way more fun than in any total war to date. The maps are varied, there are more strategic options, and you have to be more creative than before, both as attacker and defender. Its not the same battle over and over again like in Shogun 2, not messy like in rome 2, and nothing like the broken ones in Napoleon.

-Diversity in clans and cultures are more pronounced, like in what units they deploy, their starting position, etc. Playing as the western roman empire, the saxons, the huns, or the sassanid empire offer completely different experiences from one another, and makes for great replay value.

-CA has captured the essence of the time period very nicely, making the immersion into the game excellent for us who care about the historical period in which the game takes place.

-Battle maps are pretty diverse throughout the game, which often gives you the oppurtunity to try out new strategies and keeps the battles from feeling too similar.

Cons:
-The new Raze mechanic leaves a lot of the campaign map barren (The AI seems to love doing this), playing as the saxons my kingdom resembled more of a collection of patches accross Europe, instead of a strong kingdom consisting of combined regions. This is both annoying, and hurtful to game immersion. 

-Micromanaging economy, public order, sanitation and so on is a bitch. It takes a lot of time, money and strategic planning, and it is inconvenient to do so from the menues. Its not like Shogun 2, where everything is neatly organized. It takes attention away from the fun things you should be doing, like battling romans, or conquering territory, or keeping the huns away (with violence). Instead you find yourself building wells and wondering how in the world you can cough up enough money to convert the roman buildings to your faction's type of the same building.

-Horde mechanic feels gimmicky and unpolished. It is even more awkward to manage your economy in this state. 

-Naval battles are boring as usual. Nothing new here.

-A lot of unnecessairy micromanaging accosiated with dilemmas from the family tree. I really dont care of someone in my clan was drunk on duty, if the entire byzantine empire, and a horde of huns are atticking my kingdom. Some people may feel more immerged into the game by these diemmas, but I found them distracting, because it is way to many of them. 

-As many have pointed out, the number of DLC is ridiculous,

All in all, I reccomend Attila to someone who is familiar with the total war series, and want a different experience than the other titles in the series. It is not the best total war game, but I think the positive aspects in my own attila experience outweighs the negative ones. I had loads of fun playing attila, which is utimately what matters the most to me in a game.

What's ridiculous is the fact that many aspects of the game are blatantly WORSE than in Rome 2: Emperor Edition.

They actually made an enhanced edition for Rome 2 that fixed almost everything wrong with it, and now... This. It will not improve, because they just announced Total War: Warhammer.

Unit control AI is RIDICULOUS now. It fails at pathfinding when you send in more than one unit at a time. Sieges are thus made obnoxiously hard.

I appreciate  the fact that the grand strategy elements are a solid improvement over Rome 2's... But the AI in battle mode is blatantly worse than what they offered with Rome 2 Emperor Edition, and makes the game nigh-unplayable. I've stopped playing it, in fact, and will be getting back to Rome 2, despite the fact that the Horde mechanics actually make playing an underdog fun (In Grand Strategy mode)

Also, CA seriously underinvested in rosters. All of the breakaway factions look EXACTLY like their parent faction. Not only historically ludicrous, but also a blatant cashgrab. There are NO possible breakaway factions from the middle east. None whatsoever. You can't even liberate multiple settlements in a region belonging to a breakaway faction if you want to build up a strong ally. You didn't even offer us Arab factions as DLC.

So... Can't liberate the Graeco-Bactrians or Kushans from the Afrighids. Can't find a bunch of Greeks in the Sassanid Empire to put in charge of a renewed Seleucid Empire. And, to put salt in an already gaping wound, it wouldn't make any point, because all of the minor factions in the game are the same as the major factions.

All of the DLC is... Meaningless. There's no point to playing this game if you have Rome 2: Emperor Edition. None whatsoever. Get that instead. Despite its flaws, it's a better game with higher production values. I can't believe I paid full price for this piece of *ahem*.

Please, someone, kickstart a game that offers a better experience than this. I don't mind bad graphics, I really don't. What I do mind is the fact that Attila: Total War is nothing but a dress rehearsal that we, the dwindling fanbase of Total War, had to pay a pretty penny for, when it, like Rome 2: Emperor Edition, ought to have been made available for free or at least at a reduced price, as a concession to long-suffering fans who honestly wanted a game that would be good at launch and improve over time.

I will not be buying Total War: Warhammer at launch. Not by a long shot. I will wait for at least a year before buying it, so  there will at least be proper AI mods and whatnot. This game is, like Rome 2 at launch, a black stain on the reputation of Creative Assembly. It's a travesty, and I cannot for the life of me imagine what CA thought when they released this game. Was it because they were pressured by Sega?

You screwed us over, CA, and it's pretty clear you're going to drop the ball pretty quickly, since this is a B-release. It was never intended to have the production values of a Rome or Medieval game.

I've been a Total War fan since the original, Shogun: Total War. This game is leaps and bounds from the amazing game play, Medieval 2 offered, and the absolute bag of crap that Empire and Napoleon gave us.

AI is finally competitive and offers diplomatic challenges, while also being (somewhat) fair and realistic. 

Yeah, the DLC stuff is a little annoying, but it keeps the game fresh and enjoyable. I'm not a game developer so I'm not sure how much time and money goes into producing a PC game. 

Largest issue with the game is; when you liberate a city that was once occupied by a Roman faction (i.e. Gaul, Britan, Thracia) the liberated faction is basically a carbon copy of a roman faction with little to no differences. I understand, after decades of Roman occupation a faction would be almost completely reformed, but the Romans were actually quite good at being somewhat tolerant of states retaining some of their culture(names, buildings etc.) especially newly conquered regions such as Britania, and northern Germania/Gaul. Overall, it just irks me when I see a liberated British general with a Latin name, producing the same units that the Western Roman empire is producing. Just change it up a bit, especially since liberating a city can sometimes be so much more convenient and beneficial than razing.

The interface used in shogun/rome/empire was very intuative easy to navigate and fun to use.  Its not that Attilas user interface is a bad system, its just not, in my opnion, as good as what they had before.  It feels like they have cut out functionality to make it look more flashy and modern.  The best example of what I mean by this, is the built in wiki system.  When you right click on a unit or building for more informaiton in Attila and Rome 2 it takes time to load the information and you have to scroll up and down to see all the stats for that item.  I mean come on what was wrong with the information appearing instantly on one window pane so that you can quickly compare stats like in Empire.

17,16273418,english,"Something was missing in Rome II. I don't know what it was, but it just felt kind of... sterile, I guess. Attila is a great game because of the atmosphere. If you happen to read my other reviews, you may notice that I talk about atmosphere a lot. I'm a sucker for it. For instance, I kind of suck at Planetside 2, but because the atmosphere is so immersive, I still love that game and still go back to it from time to time. It feels like you are in giant, large scale battes. I don't care if I'm getting killed over and over, it's fun, damnit! 

So, Attila. I haven't seen many games tackle the fall of Rome, the super dark, gritty, depressing era that was the Dark Ages. This game does, and it pulls of the atmosphere of that period rather well. It's perfect for a Total War game, and the only reason I haven't played more of it is because The Witcher 3 came out and I wanted to play that first. But I do plan on digging more into Attila. I love the setting, the idea of roaming bands is awesome, and the upgrade tree seems much improved from Shogun II (I don't remember Rome II's research tree, but oh well). Also, the music and graphics are great. If you like Total War, give it a shot. If you've never played the series, this isn't a bad place to start, but I would probably suggest starting with Medieval II (despite its age), and then Empire next, and then either Rome II or this one depending on which setting you prefer. Or just start with Rome II, I don't care. Either way, Attila is great from what I've seen so far.

33,16153592,english,"Played almost 100hrs of this rendition of Total War and it's pretty fun. I've most of the previous games so I have some experience with this franchise. 

Pros 
-Family Tree is back with many imporovements (i.e. arranging marriages between factions, divorce, assassinations, bribery, securing loyalty/support, which all have repurcussions)
-Migrating factions, it adds an extra layer compared to your standard hold territory & expanding philosophy in previous games
-Graphics are slightly improved compared to Rome 2
-Less buggs/glitches when first released compared to Rome 2 in my opinion
-Razing settlements is also a nice touch to this game, allowing you to have a great impact on enemy factions without the need to occupy and strain your own resources 

Cons
-DLC; My first impression when I first entered the grand campaign menu was how few factions their were. I was definitely disappointed that they made the Celts/Vikings/Longbeards DLC that you needed to pay for. I would be more forgiving if they had packaged them all into one much cheaper DLC because then it might have been worth it. But $8.79 for 3 factions or $26.37 for 9, it's almost half the price of the full game. Don't get me started with the Blood & Burning DLC.
-Units; I feel like their weren't enough diverese units for each faction
-Buggs/Glitchs; Don't get me wrong there definitely wasn't as many glitches as Rome 2, but there are still buggs/glitches that occasionally pop up that the developers still haven't addressed yet. Sometimes while I'm playing there will be the occasional blinking of the terrain, which you should be wary of.

I've played as the Huns, Sassasinds, Western Rome, Picts, Franks, & the Saxons. Western Rome is a little to much if you are new to these types of games, lots to deal with on the first turn like corruption, various enemy factions and hordes, large already established empire, and negative tresaury income. The Sassasinds are quiet easy, being on the very East and surrounded by client states. Picts are quite easy and fun as well being on the very north of Britannia. The Franks and Saxons are quiet similar and are decent factions, but I got pretty bored with them after 100-150 turns.

The combat between units (yes including melee) looks great. I don't get what people are talking about with the ""units don't actually hit each other"". I charge heavy cav into a nice group of swords or something and they go fucking FLYING. Like I mean they get smushed. The chance for a cinematic kill or hit is something like 40% but you can make it look nicer with some mods that make it 100%.

I for one never experienced the issues that people were reporting with Rome 2 and that period of history was also my favorite, so naturally, I'm inclined to prefer that one.

For instance, buying the Celtic culture pack gives you three armies which are all the exact same bar two or three units. I mean, I'm not expecting 24 unique units for every single faction obviously, but when I'm paying £6 for three factions or whatever it was, I'd like a little more differentiation than I was given. Now, that's completely off topic I understand, I'm just supposed to be reviewing the core game, but I feel that is something that players need to know if they'e considering the DLC.

Also, the fact that you can just completely raze your OWN settlements is an insanely useful feature, though you may not find a use for it in ""easy"" campaigns. Again though, to fall back to a problem I have with the game, for some reason it has higher graphical requirements than previous installments such as the aforementioned Rome 2, which is to be expected, but in turn for putting a little more strain on my rig CA, I'd like to see a graphical improvement. Too much to ask? Yeah, probably.

Excellent Graphics
Good improvements to Battle AI

Diplomacy is still a joke
Very few Multiplayer game modes

Objective based Multiplayer modes? (destroy the weapons cache/sabotage?)
Attack defend Multiplayer modes?(Defenders guard objective while attackers get reinforcements)

So far I have completed a campaign as the Huns and as the Geats. Both were much fun. The politics system, the economy, additon of governors and ability to assign somebody as a retainer to gain experience from another character, and the diplomacy I feel are all greatly improved over the old Total War mechanics. 

Also the agent abilities I feel are finally about where they should be. They are somewhat expensive to use every turn to keep an enemy weak, and they aren't as OP as they were in all the past games. In Shogun 2 and Rome 2 I was practically winning wars with agents and never even declaring war, just sweeping in to take the land from the rebels after my agents did their work. That takes more time and a much larger investment now, and the agents aren't as ""sneaky"" so you take the same diplomatic hits as if you had declared war anyway.

Right now I'm playing as the vandals and have roamed across Italy, Germania and Gaul sacking and razing to amass a small fortune of about 120,000 talents. I subjugated all the minor factions I encountered along the way and they pay me tribute still. I loosely followed the historic path of the Vandals, but decided to settle a bit earlier and in southern Spain. I ended up settling in Carthago Nova and taking half of Spain from Western Rome very quickly.  Now most my former enemies that pay me tribute are very happy with me for beating Western Rome into submission, and they followed my path through Gaul and are stronger minor empires now with 2-3 settlements each. 

You might read this and think ""oh this sounds too easy"". But it's absolutely not. That fortune I gathered, all gone now. I even went bankrupt once and had to quickly go sack more Roman towns to gather money. At the same time I was dealing with food shortages and my soldiers were dropping due to starvation, and I was pretty close to a mutiny a few times. I had to put down rebellions, hire generals and governors, and with all the influence my lead character had gathered I also had to adopt these newcomers, and use all my influence to keep the political system in balance.

The navy mechanics are still a little quirky, when trying to land an invasion force it still feels like there just aren't enough places to land your ships. You end up with your forces being split up into a disorganized mass and keeping your artillery and archers on the ships to bombard the enemies closest to shore. Wouldn't it make more sense to just let the ships stack up a in 3s at the landing sites? When enemy ships are landed, you should be able to destroy them to clear a path and land right in the harbor. When fighting against a garrison force now I tend to just double up my navies and auto-resolve, though I could easily take most garrison armies with few losses by playing it through. The navy mechanics just annoy me so much that I don't want to play it out =) This is really something that I think should've been sorted out by now, and I was disappointed that when playing with a force of Viking raiders I felt limited in exploiting what should be the best of Viking abilities just due to game mechanics that haven't been figured out yet.

I would say the challenge level of Atilla is quite right, and I'm a player that has completed multiple ""legendary"" campaigns in Rome 2. I think Atilla is a little more challenging. There's still the way of ezmoding it by ""unrest farming"", where you keep a province in disorder just to continuously put down the rebellions and gain influence/xp/etc. But that seems kind of pointless in Atilla since picking on the Romans is much more fun!

Overall, I say great job to the CA dev team. You guys did great on this one. But we need more campaigns! I am saving my grand campaigns once I get a ""minor victory"" and will resume them after I have completed with all the factions. Hopefully by then you'll have more campaign DLC =)

Many people pointed out this game could've been an expansion on Rome 2, and I agree with that. However, I didn't feel like I was cheated paying for this game. Developers need to make money and there was a lot of development time invested in this game. It does look like ""a new skin for Rome 2"" on the shallow view, but after playing it for a while it becomes clear that many changes have been made.

I feel a lot of people gave this game unfairly poor reviews due to it being a ""new"" game and not an expansion on Rome 2. It's sad that everyone wants something for free or cheap these days. That's why strategy games are hurting so bad. I say ignore those fools. When they are only left with f2p/p2w mmo games they will realize the error of their ways =) Keep charging a premium price for premium games and those people will still buy plenty of copies when it goes on sale.

88,15839577,english,"If you have played Rome 2 then this game will be familiar to you. It works in a near identical way, has the same base mechanics and almost the same interface. However, it is more akin to a horror game than a TB strategy when compared to its predecessors. The threat of wandering hordes and of course, the Huns themselves always looms heavy upon those playing as the Roman Imperial factions and the others. The dwindling fertility of the land due to the worsening winters as well as the fact that the aforementioned hordes tend to turn to ash all they conquer contribute to the horror factor. Diplomacy will fail here.

The new mechanics concerning the hordes themselves also introduce interesting gameplay that has been mostly not present in previous titles. The introduction of Religions and Sanitation vs Squalor is another fun addition that adds complexity although the removal of the culture mechanic (replaced by the religions) could have been avoided. 

The battles are as good as they have ever been and each faction has interesting units to train. Also, love the introduction of eastern Roman fire ships :)

The internal politics system is fairly done. However, it tends to lack depth but compared to Rome 2 it is better.

As for the game itself, it hardly has any bugs at all by now. All the hours I've played (and trust me, I plan to play far longer than this) have been free of crashing or any bugs.

0,15788754,english,"I really tried to like this game, but even tough it had lots of promise, just like Rome 2, plenty of problems are plaguing it.

But first, the good elements:
-The cutscenes are great, enjoyable and gives a certain feel to the game
-The family tree is back! ( you'll end up in the end game with 35 cousins you don't give a shit about, which is kinda annoying because you have to ensure the loyalty of everysing one of them)
-Even if they start with an already built empire, the romans are really enjoyable to play and gives a good challenge
-The destruction you can inflict on a town is REALLY awesome, I just love to burn absolutely everything to the ground
- the AI is competent in battle. Not incredible but it will give a certain challenge.

And now, what really sucks about this game
-It should've been an expansion, plain and simple, just like FOTS. Not enough difference with rome 2 to justify a standalone game
- The turrets are fricking machine guns. Forget trying to capture it with cavalry you'll lose half of it by the time you're done.
- Burning a city to the ground is fun but as soon as you stop babysitting your troops they get caught in the burning buildings and killed.
- You're fighting a battle on a port village and you wish to bring your marines on the ground to fight inside your city. You try to disembark your troops but guess what? Enemy boats have some sort of ''reserved parking slots'' on the closest beaches, so you can't disembark them because the AI has already ordered its troops there, resulting in you having to send your boats across the map to find a free spot
- Vassals are useless, since they're gonna betray you whatever happens. As soon as their leaders gets the trait ''rebellious'' or ''hate that empire trait'' they are just ticking time bombs. Traits that, by the way, they always end up getting.
-Almost 0 variety between barbarians nations,  be that in their buildings or in their troops. Like 5 unique units and the rest are common to everyone.
-Painfully annoying AI on the campaign map. A hunnic army in Norway will get chased through the map by the sassanids if they are at war
-The horde system is a fake good idea. Losing an horde means permanently losing a city, which is extremely time consuming to rebuild if it was a well develloped one. Attacking cities with more than 1 horde will get you the ''rivalry'' trait to all the horde present, which mean less food and less money (somehow) in your coffers.
-The hunnic horde in the late game is basicly just the huns with 9 armies fully stacked with tier 3 units and infinite upkeep. Those hordes get respawned after 3-4 turns if you destroy them and the Huns as a whole are unkillable. You just never feel that you've accomplished something. You can't kill Attila, (sometimes he disappears for no reason tough, and his avatar on the diplomacy screen is some random eastern dude) and you can't destroy the hunnic hordes. The only available option is to buff your cities defenses to the maximum and let the huns attack them or beat each individual hunnic army with 4 of yours and hope the rest of the armies are too far away to reinforce. 
- Raiding as a horde is completely useless, since you make more money with an encampment
- The tons of DLC, which add NOTHING to the game itself. A bunch of new units and a different starting region. Trust me, you want to play as the viking? Take a faction that start has a horde and capture their starting region. Easily saved 10$
- Finally, the game itself, which is basicly what FOTS was to shogun 2. Except that FOTS costed 20$, added regions, was almost an entirely different game, the map didn't feel recycled AND was all around 10 times more enjoyable.

Don't waste your money on this.

15,15708814,english,"I'm gonna start this review by flat-out admitting that the [i]only[/i] reason I forked over the $44.99 for this game is because my copy or Rome II: Total War (I [i]refuse[/i] to refer to it as ""Total War: Rome II"") now refuses to load past the initial splash screen.

That being said, I did like the opening cinematics. The announcer, however, says ""They made ready for war"" and ""The air was filled with whatever it was filled with"" and ""And behold, a red horse..."" [i]way[/i] too much/ I'm all for taglines and arc words, but this is a bit much.

I started a campaign as the Eastern Roman Empire and noticed... very little of substance changed from Rome II. They added family trees back in, which is pretty okay in my book, but they seem fairly superfluous compared to Rome: Total War/Medieval II: Total War. So I started my campaign and immediately saw my cripping overextension, lack of secure borders, and F*cking Visigoths starting with two full stacks right outside Constantinople. All in all, not really unexpected considering that I started as Rome in the [i]Volkerwanderung[/i] period.

The Visigoths, though, refused unilaterally to actually take my cities for themselves and settle down. They sacked the same village four times in a row, but never even tried for Serdica. And then they just kinda... walked off to my little brother's empire, leaving me scratching my head in bewilderment. As a side note: Persia will [i]always[/i] declare war on you when Bahram dies and Khosrau ascends. Never before. Bahram is a bro, but Khosrau sucks ass.

Overall, the desperate straits that the Roman Empire faced aren't really accurately reflected in an Eastern campaign (I was able, with a minimum of fuss, to keep all my borders intact until 410 A.D., when the Sassanids sacked and burned Trebizond). The campaign AI is also [i]very[/i] stupid, even in relation to other Total War titles. The Visigoths, I already covered, but the Huns - touted in-game as the scourge of all things bright and civilized - signed a full-blown [i]military alliance[/i] with me for no good reason five turns in. Literally five turns in. I also waged a decade-long war against the Sassanids (That they somehow initiated without my notification, or chance to call my allies) that ended with me getting thousands of denarii in tribute, taking two entire provinces, and forcing the release of Armenia as a sovereign nation. The [i]very next turn[/i], they declared war on the Huns - who were my military allies and were, at that time, dicking around in Gothiscandza.

I do, however, praise the battle AI. In one of the only Sassanid victories of that war, they marched 2.5 armies to engage my 2 full legions in battle. The Persians attacked in such a way that half their forces engaged my Third Cyrenaica and the other half cut off my reinforcing Second Traiana, so I basically had to literally fight two battles at once. I lost, but I gave more than I got and the battle ended with all five generals dead. Nevermind the fact that it [i]clearly[/i] showed one Roman and one Sassanid commander remaining alive by the battle's end - I guess they committed dual-suicide at the end of the battle just to spite me?

Factions also never seem to capture my minor settlements. They only ever sack or burn them. It also costs [i]far[/i] too much to rebuild a destroyed settlement - I marched a 20-stack across the Danube into Dacia and the projected cost was somewhere around 10,000 denarii to rebuild. This on a budget of about 2,500 denarii per turn. As the Eastern Roman Empire. Creative Assembly needs to either lower the cost of settlement revuilding or lower the frequency of settlement destruction - I understand it was a barbaric time, but literally 2/3 of the map destroyed by 410 A.D. is a bit much.

This is a comparitevely minor quibble, but why is the Romano-British emergent faction named ""Britain"" instead of ""Britannia"" or ""Romano-British?"" All the other emergent WRE factions were named correctly - ""Illyria,"" ""Gaul,"" ""Italia,"" et cetera - so why not that one? Most of the flags also look completely retarded, but that's subjective.

I also find CA's strategy of charging us for factions that really should have been in the base game (If you're gonna put it out as a day-one DLC, there's really no excuse whatsoever to DLC it instead of core-game it), or for factions that are really just OP versions of vanilla factions (I'm looking at you, Viking Forefathers culture pack. Most of their units are OP versions of Saxon units). I'd say more on it, but I know I'm never gonna use the factions. I only ever use the two Romes, Sassanid Persia, and sometimes the Franks.

Also: Visigothic pike units are OP. I don't [i]care[/i] what the stats say, there is [i]no way[/i] that a bunch of half-naked migratory barbarians could fight off a Comitatanses unit while the Comitatanses is flanking it. Your Blood and Gore DLC as well. I shelled out three American Dollars for that thing and the blood doesn't even show up half the time. Most of the other half, it's a splotch here and there. I payed three good dollars to see [i]gore[/i], damnit, not some shit Spongebob would get away with!

I really have nothing whatsoever to say about the religion aspect of the game, primarily because I didn't pay attention to it at all. If I didn't see a giant cross pop up whenever I clicked on Constantinople, I could've seriously forgotten that religion was a thing. In-game cinematics, while a good idea on paper, usually just tend to freeze up my computer for five minutes and the only thing that happens is Blood, Death, Making Ready For War, and Red Horses.

And the Greek Fire. First of all, Greek Fire wasn't even invented yet, I don't think anyway, but I'm willing to excuse it by basis of it being Greek Fire, and thus Completely Awesome. What gets me is that every faction under the sun gets it when really, only the ERE and maybe the WRE should get access to it. Please CA: Fix Greek Fire. It's literally half the reason I picked the ERE at game start and I find out 30 turns in that anyone can use it. Talk about a downer.

I also understand that you're probably using the name because most people don't realize that Byzantium and Rome are one and the same, but it's a little jarring and immersion-breaking seeing Byzantine Marines in a Dromon in the same fleet as Roman Marines in a Liburnian. Eastern Roman works just as well and doesn't kill my immersion. I payed 45 U.S. Dollars basically to play Byzantium (And a smattering of Persia/Franks) and you guys can't even get that much completely right.

Technology researching is pretty much exactly the same as it was in Shogun II and Rome II, so no quibbles on that department.

Also, most of the flags are completely retarded. So retarded that I have to say it twice.

There's probably some stuff I missed in this review, but there's my 2 cents at any rate.

Pizza-Sempai out.

P.S.: I hate the unit quotes. Most of them are just R2:TW quotes with a more Christian context (""Hades can wait"" is now ""Heaven can wait.,"" etc.). The only unit quote I like from that game is the Comitatanses spears unit saying ""Co-mi-ta-tan-ses"" in that sexy, sexy accent.

So to recap, reasons to get the game: Sexy Comitatanses accents, Greek Fire, Byzantium, the ERE/WRE flags, and the Arcadius' name (And ONLY his name).

The balltes are more fun to play, and the new fetures make it all the better. BUT. I am going to focus more on the Cons in this review. There aren't many, but the few that exist are major game killing problems. 

I will start with the worst and most obvious problem: frame rates. Now, my laptop runs Rome II Emperor Edition on Ultra with a few settings like shadows, particles, water, sky turned down. I get about 30-40 FPS. I cannot get 30 FPS on Attila on any setting, except on the campaign map. The campaign map in Attila runs like butter, much better than Rome II. The battles barely run. Land battles get about 15-20 FPS. Seige battles? Well they get 10 max. I wasnt around for Rome II's release, so I don't know if this is standard for a release game. But I have to mention it. Fix the frame rate issues, optimize the game. It is literally the only thing preventing it from being the best Total War title yet. Ultra on Rome II should at LEAST get you Performance on Attila; it does not even come close. 

The second aspect: poor design choices. The game feels sloppy at times. From the bar on the left of the screen that will not go away, to the uneven stacks on unit cards, the game feels sloppy. Rome II had a lot of faults, but it was visually pleasing. Everything fit together, nice and neat. IN my 4 hours playing this, I constantly felt like I was playing a sloppy, unoptimized Rome II. Polish up the visuals, and fix the frame rates, and then it will be a great game. 

The game is fun, I give it that. But the horiible frame rates and sloppy visuals prevent it from being great. Right now, I give it a 7/10. Come back in a month or two, it could very well have earned a 10 by then. Right now, I say wait for the patches and drivers.

But when you walk closer you notice the amount of dents and scratches still left untouched, You talk to the panel beater and ask him to fix the dents and scratches he has missed, He replies that would be extra and would cost 3 payments of $9.99 and one of $3.59.

Here are a few points to sum up a few more DENTS AND SCRATCHES
The non-existent Campaign AI.
No unit collision.
Lacking the intricacies in detail of the strategy map.
Lack of Depth in pop-up random events.
Very little diversity in faction units and buiildings .
My personal opinion is the interface was terrible to use and far too messy to find what you need in the campaign map.

- 1 pissed off Citizen + general elite unit = funny bloob pack kill scene. ( if you play youll know what i mean)
-No op factions.
-Nice expansion packs - although some of the germanic tribes are very similar

Cons:
-Very like Rome II
-Little overpriced maybe
-Saxons use nordic troops??????????? -  radius mod helps to fix this slightly

I love the tactical battles in this game alot, everything is really nice and polished, but there are small unit rosters and most of the higher tier units are to expensive to actually maintain a decent army.

Those of you who love Rome and would love to see it succeed. I'd suggest getting some marshmellows and a stick, because it's going to burn. You might as well stay fed, because your people sure won't in this games ""mini Ice Age"" or whatever it is.

Lastly and the most frustrating thing, if you're one of those people who do like to watch things burn, well this games for you! Because by the the end of nearly all the campaigns, the map is burnt to a crisp, still got them marshmellows?

Sadly, this game still has more potentionl then Rome 2 on its launch, but not by much. My suggestions for those who want to buy it, but arn't sure. 

-Wait for the workshop to open up for Attila, honestly the modders saved Rome  2 anyway. (I recommend Radius BTW)

-Don't buy the DLC's just because, no point in feeding CA and chances are you might no even play the factions you buy, (kind of like the nomad factions in Rome 2.)

-Lastly, this game needs some time, if you can wait, give it about 6 months for CA to hopefully get their sh*t together. The Ai is dumb and way boosted, making for a bland experience, plus they just burn the mediteranain to the ground anyway.

I will give this a thumbs up when the following are fixed.
-Smarter AI, with less stacks.
-The game doesn't end looking like burnt turn.
-more roster option, preferably being able to recruit weaker and cheaper units, so as to actually maintain an army.
-Diplomacy gets fixed, way to many penalties and everyone hates you for having one territory and one army.
-The workshop opens and the modders can finally fix all the stuff i just b*tched about.

Until then, CA get your shit together, you money hungery bastards.

My issue is more with the balance of factions. Faction ai doesn't seem to fight eacother. They only seem to fight you and the roman empires. Instead of an epic battle between rome, britain, saxons and the celtic tribes the celts just ally with everyone and and go as far spain and almost to africa. Its pretty damn similar with every faction. Maybe this is historically accurate. I don't know. I'm not a historian but i do know it makes a pretty boring game. We have such a violent, oppressive and bloody time in history yet there's just about no conflict in Attila with any other factions. It just seems the empires dont move or fight eachother. I would rather fight constantly back and forth for 100 years for a province in britain then to see the irish and the vikings own the map. When you check all the factions diplomacy 50% are only at war with rome and the other half are at war with no one and that is just unnacceptable. I would rather have more aggressive ai and the gifts and marriages be worth more. 

Another thing that bums me out is the minor factions with similar Roman units like britain, macedonia, and judea  arent int the game until they are liberated, So you can't play a faction that has roman units unless you play as western romans or the eastern romans. which is very hard or legendary.

Another big difference, was they made the fighting in Atilla much more crisp so its enjoyable to watch. They made this game easy to mod , so if your like to mod Rome II , you will feel at home with this game, Alot of great mods arleady up for the game.  I personaly rate it 9/10 .  Reason i rate it 9/10 . is they did a good job on making the years longer, But for me i found a mod that makes 1 year = 12 turns, instead of 1 year = 4 turns. The reason this affected me is every time i played total war atilla the campain movement made no sense, It would take 3 months to move that far? heh , other wise i had no bad experinces in this game. a must buy for everyone who loves Rome II and Medieval 2 total war.

51,15512037,english,"Great game, a true sucessor to Barbarian Invasions expansion of the original Rome Total War. Which may leave you asking yourself, so WTF, why was this not just an expansion pack? My simple answer to that question is that CA has extensivly overhauled the game's engine since Rome 2 Total War, not only graphically but in cool little additions like being able to literally burn cities your seiging to the ground. Makes for a very interesting campaign if you want to be the ""bad guys"" for once in a Total War game. 

Just like its predecessor we see Rome in a state of decline, split in two and under pressure from hordes of migratory Barbarians, and of course the name sake him self Attila. The campaign is told through quotes of the seven seals of the apocalyspe(Book of Revelations I believe) as you progress through the years, not only providing really cool cinematics with excellent voice acting but also a sense of relevance and even perhaps a sneaky commentary by CA on the current world state of affairs. The problem with these highly entertaining form of Campaign however is that it seems to limit the replayibility a little bit, as in no matter which faction you pick, you will see the same cinematics, same seven seals each time. Good oppurtunity to rewatch those awesome videos though. 

the DLC is a bit of a money grab, but nothing too outragous compared to Shogun 2 or Rome 2. 

Performance wise the game is still a bit wonky with the framerates, so if you're worried about about that side of things I would recommend perhaps holding off until a few more months for them to patch everything to the same state Rome 2 was left in(Which atleast on my computer, is amazing framerates/performance), who knows you might catch it on sale that way too.",1429839728,1430181998,True,1,0,0.500454127788543701,3,True,False,False,76561197983304131,310,36,48981,0,12014,1519328579,,

55,15580310,english,"""Total War: Attila"" is not a bad game at all. It's, in fact, a great game, full of so many tweaks, additions, improvements and new possibilities than I simply had to recommend it.
I want to be clear: this game is far from perfect, but it's still a really enjoyable experience bot for hardcore Total War fans and newcomers.

Pros:
- It's difficult. Really, you will be really busy trying to figure out how to survive for the whole first part of the campaign. Diseases, wars, raids from Huns and migratory factions, the ever-increasing cold, collapse of trade, all of them are problems to be solved; but, mostly, famine will be your greatest enemy, as you will be needing to move more and more south in order to feed your people. This is true both to migratory and sedentary factions. Sometimes, it could even be necessary to leave some of your settlements behind and raze them on purpose, in order not to leave anything to the upcoming enemies or to cut the costs.
- It brings atmosphere. You will really feel part of the game's world, as you dive deeper and deeper in a desperate Europe. You will distinctly feel an apocalyptic vibe as you'll sadly see ancient cities razed to the ground, peoples destroyed and shattered and the fires of war waging across the known world. Playing with the Ostrogoths, I even felt guilty when I realized I was using the once glorious Roman Empire just like everyone else: as a big carcass to peck at little by little, in order to save my people from cold and starvation. Now, I'm playing with Western Roman Empire, and sometimes I really feel like a hero, saving what rests of civilization from the oblivion, even if I have to make drastical decisions sometimes.
- New functions. Immigration is something you have to carefully consider in the game, since it can decide the destiny of many of your outer provinces. The armies' integrity system is appealing and fun to manage, trying to prevent your armies from taking arms against you, as often happened during the last Roman period; there are lots of variables you must take into account: rivalry between armies, too much time without fighting, incompetent generals, religious disorders. Then, there is religion: it's a delight to see your religion spread, and it's interesting to manage all the various religions into your provinces. Each religion gives your faction some unique traits and two religion-specific edicts. There are lots of cults, such as Latin, Greek and Arian Christianity, German and Celtic paganism, Zoroastrism and even the strange and exotic Manichaeism.
- Migrations. Hordes are simply great to watch and to use. They are difficult to handle, you must be careful about their mood, their improvised buildings and, mostly, it's not a ""go horde, run, settle down again"" like it was in Barbarian Invasions: now, you have to be really careful about what to do with your horde. Settling without enough planning, resouces, armies and population management can easily bring about devastating disasters to your faction. Playing with migrating hordes is definetly funny and highly difficult.
- Politics. The new family tree system si simply amazing: we asked for something like that in Rome II and we got the most immersive, complex and deep politics business a Total War game ever had. Bastard sons who kill their father, daughters that try to marry against the wish of their father, ruthless careering generals that buy or sell their loyalty. In addition, the possibility of appointing governors instead of generals adds a renewed depth to your characters, and be assured that you will care about them as much as you did with every Total War game previous to Rome II.
- It's good to play even without DLCs. In fact, DLCs are absolutely not necessary to enjoy the base game, they just add new textures and playable units. There are already plenty of playable factions in the base game, enough to give the players hourse of diverse gameplay. If you don't want to buy DLC, just do not do it.

Cons:
- Graphics and engine. The graphics are just slightly improved since Rome II and the Warscape Engine still has the same flaws that every fan could notice since Shogun 2.
- Battle AI. Every Total War game has something wrong with battle AI. Sadly, Attila too. I didn't notice any enhancement and sometimes the enemy troops rout way too soon (though not as often as they did in Rome II).
- Too many DLC in little time. In barely three months, we had three four different DLCs. I don't know why CA did this, but probably it's one their worst move, because it has cooled down much of the fans' enthusiasm for the release of the game.
- Lack o historicity. There are lots of totally made up troops and even armors. The Easter Roman Empire, for example, has several infantry and cavalry units that were only first used in the VIII-IX century; and the Huns are inexplicably Mongolian (WTF?). For history fans, this could be a really annoying issue.

In ""Total War: Attila"" there are so many changes and improvements that sometimes it's easy to forget that it is Rome II's Napoleon. As a Total War fan, as a passionate gamer and as a RTS lover, I highly recommend to pick up this game. If you're not sure about it or you want to but all DLCs, you really should wait for Steam's sales.

Yup, if you count each individual group you can play as a ""faction,"" then there were 10 in the base game. Within 3 weeks of the game being released (You saw that right, 3 weeks) they had released 3 different groups and a ""blood & gore"" dlc. 

The three groups were the Celts, Vikings and Longbeards and each dlc gave 3 more ""factions."" Yup, so in [u]3 weeks[/u] they increased their roster from the vanilla 10 to 19! That's pretty much double!  To add even MORE insult, each faction group is $7.99usd a pop and the blood&gore dlc, which should have been in the game in the first place, was not in the vanilla game because  A) they release it as a $2.99 dlc later and B) Get a lower esrb rating.

One could argue that ""Hey, it's a $44.99 usd game.. I can forgive dlc,"" and I would agree with you. But, when you release three group dlcs (9 factions) for $7.99 a piece and the blood and gore pack for $2.99 [u]all within three weeks of the game being released[/u] that is unexceptable.

[*]When the older total war titles came out supposedly more 'complete', they were also more expensive. For example, Medieval II was around $90 (in Australian $) when it came out, even though there was no DLC for it. Rome II and Atilla on the other hand were around $60, giving the consumer the [i]choice[/i] of whether to purchace additional content or not. Don't care much for Longbeards or Celts? No problem, don't buy them. If you do, you still won't have paid more than you would have if the content was originally included and the full price (ie. $90) had been charged as in the older titles.
[/list]
So there you go, you be the judge. I'm off to stop the invading Mongol hordes...

The Good:
Units no longer take 99% casualties to route like in Rome 2, however when you do route a unit, and the enemies general is alive, you better expect them to come back! 

The factions are very well balanced, in fact I managed to take over most of the map using a barbaric faction, granted it was extremely difficult. 

Its smooth and fairly responsive

The campaign map is Huge, like if you took kevin Hart and stood him next to Shaq on the set of the JB roast, thats the size difference between TWR2 and TWA.


The Bad:

DLC Factions

Blood and gore you Barely notice, except for that one decapitation i saw that one time in 30+ Hrs

Missiles are extremely under powered from the front, shooting a unit of cominatences with 4 archer units on heavy shot should get at least one kill before the enemy closes the 500m gap!!

The Ugly:

Attilas face

How easy your allies turn on you after you liberated them, gave them gifts, assisted them in war, no cultural/religious aversion, and brought the 4 factions of the bitish Isles together to above 300 points of friendliness. All because they got mad I killed the roman empire and helped them expand all the way to the sassanids!!!

86,15510877,english,"This is a great game first of all. One of the best TWs out there as far as I'm concered. So lets get to it then shall we?

Pros:
   -Great Soundtrack: 
            -Rome 1 and Attila have the series cornered in the music with Attila's music really setting the perfect feeling of                   .             apocolypse at the hands of a nomadic tribe.
   -The Obvious.... RTS and TBS Mixing:
            -For those of you who are new total war, the base idea behind the game is amazing. Turn based campaign for     .            whereyou manage your empire, build your cities, etc. etc. It really is one of the greatest strategy series out      .            there in my opinion.
   -Graphics:
             -No the graphics are not the greatest graphics in history, and at times the game's preformance drops if you try  .             to go beyond your computer's capabilities. BUT considering that you can have 10,000+ people per army         .             fighting all at once, the graphics are plenty fine can't have everything people.
   -Dificulty:
             -This game is NOT easy all the time. While yes the AI may seem overly agressive, CA went with a plan to create  .              an apocolyptic feel to the game. But you can always custimize your difficulty when you start a new game.       .              Want to take in the scenery and play casually? Set the diffuculties (one for campaign one for battle) to easy   .              and relax. Want hell? Set all difficulties to legendary, Ppick Western Roman Empire for your first game and try  .              to hold every singe territory. without losing a single battle.


Cons:
    -Demanding:
             -Yes this game can be hard on computers especially older ones. But like i said earlier, you can have 10,000+    .              individual soldiers one the field at once. Though you can lessen this by simply reducing graphics levels and      .              unit size.
    -Bugs/oddities:
             -Yes there are bugs like all games. But show me a gmae that has no bugs and I'll show you a movie. Some are   .              can affect you for sure, CTDs, thje occasional freeze, but these are minor in my opinion. Maybe 2 CTD since I  .              got it at release, and they are still patching. Then there is the occasional oddity. Such as (in my opinion at       .              least) the chopping down of gates with melee units. While better than the old torches, I'd prefer it where you                .              lose if you can't breach the walls instead of suiciding gates. But hey to each their own.

Neutral: (THESE DO NOT AFFECT MY OVERALL RATING. THESE ARE JUST THINGS I HAVE AN OPINION ON/ WOULD LIKE TO TALK ABOUT)
      -DLC:
              -Yes there are a ton of people complaining about the many DLCs. I personally have no problem with them. CA .               is a business after all, so let me talk about the two main ones so far released.
                         -Culture Packs:
                                      -These are simply where you pay money to unlock certian factions to play as along with some   .                                       new units and building. Attila's culture packs are actually fairly decent with all (minus the         .                                       viking one) having little stories at go along with them. The main complaint agaisnt these is      .                                       ""HOW DARE YOU CA, HOW DARE YOU CUT CONTENT FROM THE GAME THAT SHOULD BE IN                     .                                       BASE GAME YOU EVIL B******S HOW DARE YOU."" Well, you don't like it don't buy it. That        .                                       simple. These are NOT essential. It is not like CA is removing the ability to play the battles and .                                       turning that into DLC. No, they are simply officially unlocking a faction in game. I repeat. Don't .                                       Like it? Don't buy it.
                         -Blood and Burning DLC:
                                       -This adds in blood, decapitation, bile, and burning men textures (as well as a few animations   .                                        to fit the new content). FIRST OFF THIS IS NOT MEANT AT ALL TO BE A BASE PART OF THE   .                                        GAME NO0T EVEN A LITTLE, so for everyone demanding this as a FLC, no. The reason this is  .                                        NOT part of the base game is simple. Some countries will ban the entire game if it was. due   .                                        to the obscene amount of blood and gore. By making it a DLC, they allow people to play it in  .                                        places that the entire game would be unplayable in. To those who say that this is cut content  .                                        and nothing but bull that you can't get it with the base game, that is just selfish. I'd rather      .                                        pay three bucks and let someone in Germany play this game than be the jack*** who forces  .                                        it to be banned in an entire country just because I don't liek that it isn't in hte base game.      .                                        Once again it's simple. You don't want the DLC, don't buy it. You want it buy it. (DLC rant       .                                        over)
 

Overall rating in my opinion. 9/10

7,15498376,english,"It was the year of 410 AD and the Roman Empire had been saved. The war against the Sassanids and their numerous allies was not going well and the filthy easteners were preparing for a final push. Northern barbarians had pushed into Thracia and would burn down the gold mine there, one of the biggest sources of income for the Romans.The Emperor Arcadius was  stablizing Armenia and the Africans were pushing from the west. There were 3 Legions guarding the gateway city between the Empire and the savages. the Lord had sent them a vision of what was to come, defeat, death, blood. The 3 generals, all distinguished and honorable men, knew what had to be done. Vindonius, the best of them, the man who had defeated countless invading armies led his noble 2,000 into the endless dunes. Each Roman knew they would not live to see their homes, their wives, their children, but they did not run, did not cower away, for they were romans, not some raving band of undisciplined heathens. The gathering horde of 10,000 was waiting for them. The proud romans charged their ranks, brothers in arms and one with the Lord. After the 8 years of war, the Sassanids were expecting unmotivated, weak willed farmers, but what met them on that field was more than that. What they encountered was a band of brothers, men of culture, schooled in the arts and bred for war. They fought not only with the fire of honor and brotherhood, but with the fire of civiliazation and their faith in God. The rising sun behind them illuminated the world as if it was a visual represetation of their determination. They fought like lions and pushed the barbarians back. But even the heavens could not change their fate. Even as 10 Easteners fell, a Roman fell beside them. Some from arrows, other from their expert horsemen, and many from the spear and sword. Even as each one of their generals fell one by one, they pushed back against the Romans. by the fall of night, all that was left was Vindonius and his honor guard. They all defended their general to the last. But as the sun fell on this crimson day, so did Vindonius. The honorable 2,000 put down the swords of their mortal lives and took their rightful place at the hand of the Creator. the mighty trumpets sounded as they marched into the Kingdom of God and great rains were sent to the sacred ground to wash away the death. It is said rivers were formed by the weeping of widowed wives and orphaned children, but because the Sun fell on Vindonius, it rose once more for Rome. The 4,000 remaining barbarians were dleighted despite their heavy casualties as they thought that they had just won the war. Surely the last embers of resistance would be put out by the cold air filling the place of their beloved General? Surely the men of learning and luxuries would come to any terms the Sassanids wished. But their hopes were misplaced. For with the final breath of Vindonius, that ember of hope he carried in him blew to the tinder box of Rome and ignited a roaring fire. Filled with the last gift Vindonius had to give they marched with renewed vigour, fought with fiercer determination, and the seemingly depleted legions filled with those ready to fight.

The UI has had an improvment as has the political system and province managment. A return of the family tree sees generals take back their importance to the player, trying to forge a path for them through history and all the trials which come with it. 

At times, the design decisions made with unit upgrades/unlocks can seem counterintuitive, and some retinues still not working as intended but the launch of the game went smooth and since then there has been no glaring issues rending the game unplayable. 

I do have to recommend the title. Attila is a very good game with a very active modding community, so if you pick the game up and have some issues with certain aspects of the game, then I am sure you'll find mods to help tailor the experience to your desires.

The engine still doesn't fully support unit collision and combat is always a one-vs-one statistics fest instead of multiple soldiers fighting one simultaneously as they used to in Rome 1 and Medieval 2.

Most of the flaws with the engine and the design decisions I could ignore / live with and still enjoy the game. But what really kills it for me is the severe lack of mod support (because lets face it, SEGA knows the mods are better than their lazy DLC) and the piece by piece selling of purposefully gated away content. The blood and gore DLC I would have happily paid for, but the factions are all already in the game and simply locked away from the player to milk the fans dry.

11,14520813,english,"I edited this review for serious reasons. It was originally silly.

Total War: Attila is probably my favorite Total War game to date. The campaign is dynamic, new, exciting, and above all: fun.  Playing as the Romans and fighting to survive is one of the most challenging missions in all of video gaming. Playing as barbarian tribe trying to survive in the shadow of death is just as fun. Combat is fluid, fast, and brutal.

It pains me to give this game a negative review. It is something I must do, however. The DLC practices Sega and CA have implimented with this game are inexcusable. To charge for an incomplete game then release things that should have been in the game from the start (For example, the Blood and Burning includes gore effects and enhanced fire.) is downright shameful. These petty culture packs are, bluntly put, stupid. They're hardly different from other factions at all. Its a cash grab; pure and simple. 

This little tidbit is the most urksome. In the days of Rome II, people were allowed to make mods to make all factions playable. CA has SPECIFICALLY stated that mods like that are no longer allowed to be made because they plan on perhaps releasing every damn faction in the game as a paid culture pack. ACTUALLY, CA has banned all modifications of the campaign map in its totallity. In Attila, modders were promised more possibilities than in even Rome II. These shady business practices took one of the best aspects Rome II had going for it and squashed it with Attila.

22,14928243,english,"Definitely the Napoleon of Rome II. Some say it is a copy and paste of Rome II, but I disagree, even by the end of all the patching that game was a disaster without mods. Attila is better in every way essentially, better tech tree, better town management and building, better combat options (because apparently half the troops in Rome II couldn't use loose spacing), the barbarians are represented better, the AI actually build armies now and aren't horrifically braindead with their building choices (yes AI, build 16 farms across one region...), more depth in siege battles, agents are less overpowered (you can't get a champion almost instantly anymore), the ground is FAR more detailed and well themed, ranged units have more depth and are more balanced, family tree/government is usable and has a point again and better skill progression of characters.

There's a few things I don't like however, namely; general's bodyguard units are too weak later on in the game, but more importantly, you no longer get a choice of bodyguard units, which is my most hated change for some reason, I liked in Rome that you got a choice from like 3-5 different units, often a really fun unit like elephants or chariots. 

The raze settlement mechanic is far too imbalanced. It is way too easy for the player and the AI to raze a settlement, often able to attack, sack and raze in one turn. Razing does far too much permanent damage to the player or AI and it is too costly and time consuming to settle on a razed location. Due to this and the AIs fondness with razing, the campaign map ends up mostly razed and deserted.

Online Co-op Campaign matches dysync FREQUENTLY. Often you can attempt a resync, which takes ages, while other times the game just closes.

No workshop........... really?

The AI are still far too diplomatically stubborn and stupid, they very rarely accept reasonable deals, almost never accept peace even if they are very far away and weak unless you pay a hellish amount of money. I have had a situation where I paid them a considerable amount for a non agression pact, only for them to break it the FOLLOWING turn and also declining my trade offer, only for them to ask to trade a few turns later. I've also had the AI break three treaties including non agression by declaring war in a single turn but suffer no diplomatic penalty to other factions.

The horde system is really cool, but due to the AI diplomacy I mentioned above it is pointless to stay as a horde for any extended period of time. As a horde you cannot seem to request military access (not that the AI would agree anyway), probably because as a horde you own no land for them to access in return, but an option to get access for money would be helpful. Anyway, due to that, factions get angry at you for trespassing even if you have a defensive alliance and they will eventually declare war on you, bribe more people into the war against you, never take peace due to their stubborness, repeat until the whole world hates you and tracks you down and you lose. You shouldn't have to pay above 20k to get a weak faction to stop fighting you at the start of the game. Not only that but making puppet states doesn't seem to work because of how much your state will hate you and then declare war on you later anyway.

The game doesn't run as well as Rome II, which I expected considering how much better it looks, but i'm sure improvement could be made here. The game sometimes will freeze up between turns, it doesn't happen often and thankfully it does not crash the game, but it is still annoying. This seems less prevelant now than at launch though.

Unit portraits don't look as good as Rome II, they had a really cool theme going and I think they could have made it work again by making the painting look a bit darker. Also, the voice actor for all of the non Roman/Eastern factions is the same shitty one from Rome II.

First two culture packs were clearly cut from the original game to be sold/used as a preorder bonus. Frustrating, but was bound to happen due to almost all big publishers being jews now days. If you thumbs down the game or not buy it because of this then I really can't blame you on that principle. Hopefully we get free stuff like we did in Rome II, but I doubt it because Attila wasn't a disgrace on launch so there's no need for damage control. In saying that, I do feel that the price of Attila was pretty great.

I'd like to see a heap more unit types and some more playable factions though, I'm willing to pay for that if it is good value, most importantly however, MORE GENERAL UNITS.

Overall a hell of a lot better than Rome II though, aint no Shogun 2, but it earns the Total War name. The Steam reviews are incredibly harsh on Attila, like seriously, the % of recommends is lower than Rome II, which I cannot fathom.

I honestly have not a single bad thing to say about this game.

35,15479153,english,"The last Total War game I played was Medieval 2 (back when my GPU had 1gb of VRAM), I loved that game and expected the same thing with upgrades features, AI and gameplay when I bought Attila. 

I have been playing for about a month now, my feelings are mixed. The campaign map is stunning (if you have the rig to support it) and the battlefield looks leaps and bound better than I remember. There have been many improvements since I last played this series; 1) family politics is challenging and fun. 2) The way in which trade works is great (if sometimes frustrating). 3) The sheer amount of factions is astounding. 4) I LOVE the horde mechanics for this game, it gives a totally different way to play the game.

The negatives for me lie in the UI, its unintuitive, and I've found myself endlessly googling to find out how to do certain things, such as change religion etc.. The tiles for building buildings in towns and cities are unintelligible from first glance, and I hate the fact that you cant upgrade more specific parts of your provinces (eg. Roads). The way in which they are grouped in to provinces is frustrating, as you no longer have the potential to grow a small village into a huge city with enough love, although I understand why the developers have done this and see the benefits.

I have to comment on the DLC as there seems to be a crusade (get it) against it lately. I understand the anger, and i share that anger when it comes to titles like Evolve, and in some respects it applies here... £1.99 for textures that should have been in the game? come on guys.. On the other hand, the addition of new playable factions and units through DLC is relatively accpetable, and it allows you to pick and choose who you would prefer to play with. It would have been nice to see more content in the base game, but overall this was not a deal-breaker for me.

Overall I have loved playing this game, it still has that fantastic powerful feeling of charging two huge armies together, and building an empire, despite my grievances and nostalgia over past features, this is absoultely worth the money.

39,15449441,english,"Total War: Attila has, somewhat restored my faith in the Total War franchise. As a player and a modder, I have always enjoyed and loved the Total War titles, but after playing Rome II I couldn't help but feel a little disappointed to say the least. I felt that the game was slightly vague and I found difficulty in trying to play it repetitively; again and again. The game's lack of diversity and its repetion of things such as unit classes and faction traits brought me to the point where i abandoned all hope in it and resorted to Shogun 2, Skyrim and Rust. I couldn't help but try and give it another go after a few weeks of cooldown, but i felt that i was playing it primarily because i felt guilty, rather than enjoyment. The only thing i enjoyed about Rome II was the Assembly kit; In other words I enjoyed making mods rather than playing the game!

When Attila was released I was very excited and i had great expectations, although i couldnt help but feel a little optimistic: ""What if it is another letdown like its predecessor?""; ""What if it is repetitive and vague like Rome II?"" I could only wonder! 

When the trailers for Attila came out I liked what I saw, and not knowing too much history about Atilla and the Huns' nomadic campaign, i was keen to become educated with a lesson of Total War! 

50%... 60%...85%...99% ""Launch""... I Couldn't wait, my anticipation and all my questions were about to be answered. The intro was perfect; it was dark and gloomy; a perfect way to introduce the King of the Nomads. The first thing I did was straight to 'Custom battle', I have long been thinking about the latest factions and units! This is something that I love about Total War; its units! My first impressions where that there weren't too many, but then again there weren't many in Shogun 2, so i wasn't too worried. I was also slightly let down that there was no description of the particular unit, just stats. As i loaded in my first ever battle, the excitement grew! There they were, the newly textured units, their armour glowing and gleaming from the sun's beam! They looked beautiful... and another thing, no more Falcatas!! My hate for that sword is legendary!

Two weeks down the line and i was loving it. The new Blood dlc along with new culture packs came at an extras cost, but they made a big impact on the game! The campaign map is beautiful and factions feel much more individualised and iconic. Attila, for me has restored my faith in Total War and now i long for the release of the workshop, along with the Assembly Kit.

46,14572136,english,"It is time for me to redo my review.  I did one around 30 hours into the game, which was premature and I regret giving it a thumbs up.

          I will do a score system, 1-10 with very brief reasons, straight to the point in each category.  Here it goes.

Graphics 8 : Nothing really inspiring or new enough to wow me.  This is on all the highest settings. 

Sound 7 : If this is the reason you play a total war game you are probably doing it wrong.

Gameplay (early) 7 : This is the juice for good comments.  This is where a player gets into the game for 40 or 50 hours and is still happy, enjoying the new things in the game.  You get to choose between awesome factions, and you also can be a horde and wander around.  Something felt off to me, but I was so happy to have another new total war game that I ignored it and kept going.  

Gameplay (late) 2 : This is where everything comes crashing down.  Once you hit a certain point, it feels as though they didn't get this far.  You will start to encounter spontaneous AI, making decisions that make no sense, and you will realize the AI can see your armies and will chase them all around no matter what you do.  The AI, with this ridiculous advantage of 'they can see you but you can't see them' makes horde mode VERY hard.  You will also watch as allies will pillage your land because for some reason that is the stance they enjoy doing the most.  If you turn against them, chances all your allies will then turn on you.  There are so many messy things going on, nothing is smooth at this point.  On top of it all, agents will appear EVERYWHERE.  If you go down the military tree primarily first, you will find yourself in a world of pain at this point, and in most cases you can't continue.

Combat 5 : You will find the ai will sometimes defend when its attacking you, and you can wait the (30 minutes for me) for combat to end, or you can charge them and most likely lose.  AI will do a great deal of things that will make you scratch your head, but this is common for Total war games.  Still, a game that is so close to rome 2 should have already had most of this fixed.  I mean, its the same map and everything, I feel like I'm playing a massive remake of rome 2, or someone made a mod that was a little better then rome 2. 

Content 2 : There is not enough in this game to justify its price, and the fact that they put out expansions of stuff that is already in the game and charge money is the reason I can safely say I am done with the total war series.  I will never play another game from these butt pirates again.  After I pay 50 dollars or more for a game, it should be complete or at least not try to butcher me with pay only content.  No offense to any idiot that reads this that thinks CA is being reasonable with its expansions.  The only real way to get them to stop is either have someone new to fill the need for these games that won't do it or we stop buying it.

I apologize to those that do not feel the same way, but please if you respond do it with constructive critism.

The battles are not as blobby as Rome 2, but still are less enjoyable to watch than Medieval 2's tense battles. They kept some fundamental Rome 2 changes that are really bad. I will tell you them.

The system of Shogun 2 towns was perfect. There were physical representations of your farms on the map that your foes could raid. In Rome/Attila there are only settlements. So you must needs put your army in ""raid stance"", which aside from being fucking lame, is almost completely useless.  I want my vikings to raid the enemies resources not just set them in a stance. They decided to make overall food numbers higher which IMO was a mistake. The building system has way too many hidden menus. The raze mechanic really isnt that cool. Ive never even seen an AI faction restore a town. The ""Zeal, Cunning, and Authority"" skills for characters are so lame. In Shogun I loved leveling up my generals because of the awesome skill tree and retainer system. And generals actually had stars in different areas like ""infantry/cav command"", ""besieger/defender"" etc marking what they were good at. Thats all gone.

While Rome II had the issue of nothing really happening along with the factions all being similar, Attila does not have this issue. Rome II has 3 basic cultures, Barbarian, Romean and Middle East. Attila has a LOT more unique factions, even more with the Vikings, which are awesome. The battles also have an improvment with better AI. Another thing i like is that fact that the AI build armies, so you actually have to think to win a battle since you are often equaly matched.

Buisness model. 
Now i've seen a lot of people going off on how ""They shipped out an unfinished game and are charging for the rest!"" no. The state of the modern game industry is awful. If games aren't free, they are super expensive. Total War still holds onto some of the old buisness models, but they can't make enough money that way. The factions are totaly optional, i have not bought the Longbeards pack because i didn't want them, and i don't feel cheated at all. I did buy the celtic pack because i wanted to play as those factions, but i didn't have to buy the pack. DLC is a scourge on modern games but Total War does not abuse this any more than most game companies. Where gearbox will ship 10 DLCs with little to no content and is always dangled above you if you don't have it, Total War takes the stance of ""Want this? no? Okay. Yes? awsome"" with content that is balanced and fair. The blood and gore DLC is also a tremndously smart idea, if Attila was rated M, it would have a much smaller group of players, but in making it teen they lost a few of the hard core M gamers.

78,15329883,english,"Before I start, yes, the DLC money-grubbing of CA is ridiculous. And as much as I hate myself for buying the Viking pack (I just love viking culture), this isn't a DLC review. This is a review for the game itself, so let's all just move on.

Anyways, I loved Rome 2 having logged over 300 hours on it, decided to give Attila a whirl. And it's certainly interesting. First I tried the Huns, and while the fresh idea of carrying your settlement with you was pretty neat, I wasn't doing so well (although I definitely got a kick out of razing a captured settlement and watching the whole region burn to cinders). I'm sure I'll head back and give them another try, but I decided to quit and having a deep admiration of what the Romans had achieved, decided to try the Western Roman Empire faction.

I truly feel as though CA nailed the time period perfectly, you start off thrown into a vast expanse of regions and armies which can be a headache to get a grip on what you do and don't have right away (essentially you have a bunch of 6-10 unit armies and level 1 structures) and also what's going on around your borders. Within the first end turn I was already losing settlements. And I spent the first 6-7 turns trying to build up my starting armies and hold what I had, though it proved fruitless as new factions kept appearing to slaughter my poor little plebs.

The name of the game in Rome 2 was expand expand expand until nothing is left, and as the Romans here, the game has been changed to retreat, recover, and re-expand. To expand on that logic, the main objectives throughout Rome 2 were ""capture so -and-so number of regions and control so-an-so amount of armies"" Whereas as the first objective in Attila is simply, ""Survive""

It's definitely a dark and twisted version of Rome 2, and while I don't have many hours logged yet, I'm sure I'll be playing this for a long time to come. And if CA had put as much effort into the game as they did acting like greedy DLC-scamming scumbags, I can only think how much better it might be.",1428882271,1428882271,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False,76561198056588841,144,1,8038,0,443,1557603920,,

It does have the feel of a DLC; but I think it is to Rome 2 as Napoleon was to Empire... an improvement but overall an expanded DLC.

98,15275568,english,"TL;DR:  A stable and functioning Total War release with extremely solid gameplay in real-time battles, BUT a horribly thought-out slew of campaign mechanics that seems determined to make it extremely hard to experience those battles and a terrible DLC business model earns this title a solid ""DO NOT BUY AT FULL PRICE"" designation.  If you're going to purchase this game, I highly recommend waiting for a sale *and* good mod releases.

Read on for the nitty gritty:

This latest Total War release was certainly more stable and playable than Rome 2, with interesting units and well-rounded battle mechanics.

However, it is plagued with major problems.  Primarily, the pacing is absolutely abysmal.  There are Let's Plays of this title on Youtube where the players go *multiple episodes* without a single battle.  In one particularly egregious case, a series I watched had *4 continuous hours of footage* without a single notable engagement.  This is not a fluke - this is because of the way the game is designed.  That's right, awesome real-time battles in a game that makes them frustratingly rare.

Without the fantastic, large-scale real-time battles between thousands of soldiers, this game turns into a much less feature-diverse version of Civilization.

Additionally the DLC is very overpriced and offers very little unique content.  The ""culture packs"" mostly use units identical to those already in use by core factions.  Deceptively, you are paying for 3 to 6 new units to play with for 8 dollars per ""culture pack"" and that's very little potential for new gameplay.  The blood and gore DLC is extremely underwhelming, and even modded it still doesn't impact the visuals anywhere near as much as the Rome 2 equivalent did.

By far the worst issue with this title is that a huge plethora of mechanics contribute to poor pacing.  It is a complex issue and was not carefully evaluated by the developers.  The vast majority of fights you engage in will be auto-resolve and you will pass dozens of turns looking for a fight while your generals twiddle their thumbs and turn to alcoholism or degeneracy.

Here are some of the reasons for ""poor pacing"":

1.  Like Rome 2, your army count is artifically hard-capped by the ""Imperium"" mechanic.  Each army *must* have a general, unlike Total War releases prior to Rome 2.  Without a single doubt, this is my least favorite contrivance of any Total War release I've ever played.

2.  Units tend to have very expensive upkeeps.  Researches that improve your basic units also make them more expensive to train and to maintain.  Once you've researched a unit upgrade, the lower-tech version can no longer be built.  Say goodbye to cheap armies.

3.  Researches and building construction are very time-intensive and often very expensive, taking dozens of turns to complete for higher tier structures.

4.  Public order management is absolutely a nightmare.  The potential sources of negative public-order far outweigh your sources of potential bonuses.  Many public order management mechanics are opaque or not well explained.  Bonuses to public order comes from buildings, garrisoned forces/generals, governors, and researches - so both #1, #2, and #3 all combine to make this one hell of pacing issue.  This could be easily resolved if it were possible for someone to make a mod allowing armies to exist independent of generals or an army cap, but *that's hard coded into the game*.

5.  AI opponents on the campaign map exist somewhere on a spectrum between passive and cowardly.  Armies will always dance away from combat and repeatedly retreat too far for you to pursue and engage.  Even relatively even engagements will result in an AI retreat.  The AI seems to do everything it can to avoid a fight. The empire-management mechanics are such a convoluted morass that the devs gave the AI what is effectively a money-cheat, so you see factions do things like holding their capital as their only territory with 5 full armies sailing back and forth aimlessly or sitting idle.

The result:

""Let's make a game called Total War and focus every major mechanic on preventing the player from waging Total War.  YEAH!""

For having such a great real-time battle system, this game seems determined to prevent you from enjoying it.

While much of this might sound like difficulty-whining, it is not - none of these things are *hard* to deal with.  You can get rich.  You can get big.  The process is going to be extremely slow-going, and the whole time you're dealing with these constraints you will have few opportunities to enjoy the acclaimed real-time strategy elements this series is famous for.  It's not hard - it's slow.  And boring.

I really, really, really want to like this game.  As it is, I wish I'd waited until it went on sale.  For now, I am waiting for a competent modder to recognize all of the factors that drastically bog-down the campaign gameplay and tweak them properly without going too far and breaking them or messing with the stuff the game already does well.

If I were going to try to fix this gameplay, here's where I would start:

1.  Allow armies with no generals - but a significant morale penalty in battle if they aren't defending a city.  Yay, now your generals can be more than glorified babysitters getting drunk and siring illegitimate children 24/7!  No more worrying about map-hacking AI magically butt-humping your freshly undefended frontier cities the second you actually try to leave your walls and play the game.

2.  Halve completion times for all structures and researches.

3.  Tweak public order penalties from one or more sources - immigration and religious tension being primary culprits.

4.  Get rid of Civil Wars.  What a ridiculously un-fun mechanic.

5.  Remove army caps entirely.  What the hell were they for in the first place?  Preventing the player from having fun, I guess.  Historically nonsense as well.  ""Hey, Viking Warlord - sorry, you can only have 5 armies even though you sleep every night on a mountain of gold because you don't have any room left in the treasury.  Go conquer this arbitrary number of settlements and we'll let you make a 6th!  OH, nevermind that you have twice that number of settlements to defend and the Africans are psychic and will attack the second you try to go conquer that city.  Do it anyway.""  Please.

6.  Surgically install testicles on all of the AI leaders.  I didn't know the ancient world was ruled by eunuchs and cowards.  Maybe fighting unfavorable battles is unwise, but the AI running away from 90% of fights ISN'T FUN.  More aggression.  More fights.  Less prancing back and force and magical map-hack backstabs.

Mods fix some of these issues.  Some mods exacerbate some of these issues.  Some of these issues are un-fixable because they are *hard coded*, like armies requiring generals.  Finding the right combination of tweaks to properly address these issues and assemble something resembling a *game that rationally emphasizes its strengths as a title* has proven to be a challenge to me and I've yet to find the right mix.

Most focus on how many DlCs there are and how bad the game ran in the beginning and oh this or that. Where is the review of game play, of the amazing cinimatics that take place while in campaign, of the frustrating challenge of killing Attila(the only white guy in an army of asians). 
     First let me state that all of you complaining about the DLC are just idiots. The DLC might be numerous and at first you might feel cheated, but stop and look at the price of the game before you keep moaning. This game released for 45 bucks and you don't have to get the DLC, so stop whining and if you want the DLC just pay the normal 70 dollars a game like this cost.
     Second I haven't had a single preformance glitch in months.
     Third this game is fun but it isn't Shogun Total War, if you want a Shogun Total War game go play it instead of harrassing an amazing game that if not compared to your godly view of Shogun would get the respect it deserves.
      Lastly this game will last you until the next release, if you complete all the campaigns and just enjoy the game you could easily play until the next total war is released and have an enjoyable time, unlike other games where you get bored due to repition in this you just leave due to the fact you may never truly win, but that makes this enjoyable.

First of all, the release of the product was polished and playable (unlike Rome2 TW).  Secondly, the game's inherent mechanics make it very fun, challenging, and entertaining to play long campaigns.  This is the first TW game I sat and played 220hrs straight before taking a break with another game.

- The unit rosters are huge, and offer a lot of variety.  They made the units more rock-paper-scissor so that you can counter units easily.  
- Cavalry and the 'Charge' stat are actually useful for the first time in a TW series.  
- The AI and path finding are worlds better than other TW games.
- The AI are actually smart and difficult on the campaign map.  No more idling and boredom.
- The option to raze, sack, loot, or occupy settlements creates a diversified map including barren lands you can resettle, and different unique benefits to each faction (like increased looting income for barbarian type factions).
- Each faction/culture is much more unique than other games.  Even the challenges, objectives, unique units and overall goals make each campaign different.  No more boredom!
- I find myself playing out more battles rather than autocalc due to the more fun and engaging battles with my units.

Overall, I find it interesting that those who provide negative reviews have still played the game so much, and yet still complain.  Have they not gotten their dollar worth of entertainment?

36,15188284,english,"Total War: Attila is a really good strategy game. If you are new to the Total War series, then Attila is a phenomenal game to pick-up. It really is.

But, unfortunately, if you are a long-standing fan of the series who bought Rome 2, then Attila is still more proof that Rome 2 was blatantly rushed. And, worse, if you bought Rome 2, then you probably feel like Rome 2 was an extended, paid, DLC-laden beta for Attila.

This is the dichotomy I think most players will fit in to. There's certainly a small (very small) number of people who thought Rome 2 was a great game from start to finish, but the vast majority of Rome 2 players are going to under-rate Attila because of how much Attila depended on Rome 2 in terms of figuring out what to add, what to fix, etc. And on the complete opposite tack, people new to Total War will find Attila to be an outstanding game.

Truly, Attila is both an outstanding game as well as a hated game.

In isolation, Attila is one of the better strategy games I've played in quite some time. Factions are quite varied, with nomadic factions, hybrid factions that can settle in cities only to uproot later, and traditional factions. Rosters are asymmetrical in design but not chaotic, and often have one stronger area than usual and one weaker. Campaign strategy is much more interesting, and battles are a bit better (though some lingering problems with sieges and naval battles still persist and carry over from Rome 2).

And in relation to Rome 2, Attila is a hated game. The disasterous initial release of Rome 2 weakened the playerbase's faith in the developer, and Rome 2, though given a high level of support/patching/etc.. never really recovered. Instead, Attila sort of became the finished product  for a $60 beta test, and many fans are still reluctant even now to forgive this.

I have to recommend Attila. As someone who played Rome 2 from release until the few weeks before Attila came out, I can say that Rome 2 was definitely not what it should have been, and it indeed was like a paid beta for Attila in some regards. But once I stomached that, Attila is a great game in its own rite. It borrows enough assets from Rome 2 to finally give us a largely fixed experience with them, and then adds entirely new details all over the campaign experience.

And if you didn't get Rome 2, then Attila is a no-brainer. 

The only non-Rome 2 related stuff I'd mark Attila down for is the multiplayer, which has always been the series' major weakness.

41,14701683,english,"I've played every Total War game since the original Rome (Yeah, I never payed the first Shogun or Medieval, sue me.) And I'm gonna say this straight-up: Attila is a damn hard Total War. You instantly realize this in campaign when from the get-go they tell you to survive until 400 AD. That's literally only 20 turns.

It's a step up from Rome 2 gameplay-wise. There are awesome new political and family tree systems, (which take awhile to master/understand, but are very cool once you do.) and the AI is exponentially better than Rome 2's. 
However, from a content perspective, Attila is lacking when compared to previous Total War titles. There's a good number of playable factions, but most of them are really really similar Germanic tribes. (Which, don't get me wrong, is really historically accurate, but they should have been made with some more distinct units.) Something tells me the content/faction roster will expand with the inevitable release of DLC's and culture packs >.>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
But I digress.

The setting is very cool. It's the end of the great Roman Empire, and the whole game has a really interesting apocalyptic atmosphere of doom. You feel really threatened. Intense winters come, the Hunnic horde pushes further west and Germanic tribes are consantly on the move. You're forced to make some hard decisions, and this, coupled with the great level of interactivity and depth of the political family tree, gives the player a deeper level of connectivity with their faction. 

TL;DR? Total War: Attila's gameplay is much improved from Rome 2. The AI is good, the new horde option adds interesting gameplay and the family tree system is awesome. 
The variety of factions and cultures is lacking, due to the specific time period, but this will probably improve with the release of culture pack DLC's (ugh..)

77,15092453,english,"widely unknown historical period, beautifully explored through this game.
Total War: ATTILA is a complex, historically accurate grand strategy game offering challenging objectives for whichever faction one chooses to play as, whether it be holding together a crumbling empire as the romans or bringing death and destruction upon the world as the huns. The newly reintroduced family tree is better than ever, bringing even more illegitimate children and flaccid leaders. Politics has been overhauled as well, making it easier to understand and control. The campaign map is beautiful as always, and changes dynamically with the seasons as the years go by. Battles remain faithful to the Total War franchise, however some units could be better balanced. 
Overall, Total War: ATTILA is one of the strongest Total War games i have played in a while, and was a breath of fresh air after Rome II's disastrous launch. I would say Attila is on par just as great as Shogun 2, and the only real issue i have with the game is the inclusion of so many overpriced DLC packs that SHOULD HAVE BEEN SHIPPED WITH THE GAME AT NO COST.

While some peoples perish utterly, the civilised build baths, fine industries and temples.

Total War: Attila is certainly a big improvement over Total War: Rome II in many ways. At first glance, you will notice that the family tree is back, allowing you to make tactical decisions on who in your family commands what. Be careful though, as some may see some of your actions as betrayal and will turn on you, sparking a civil war. Additionally, the map is a bit more detailed and graphically enhanced. While still running the same engine as Rome II, it still adds some additional twerks here and there. What stands out most in Attila is how the game is played. 

Attila is not like other Total War games. In general, Total War promotes the idea of empire building. Attila, on the other hand, is about survival. Whether you start as a germanic tribe or the Roman Empire itself, surviving the Hunnic onslaught as well as rival empires will put you in difficult situations. There will be time when you must forgoe a settlement to protect another. This forces you to play the game extremely defensively. Eventually you may peak outside your borders, capturing a new settlement, but at a much slower rate than previous Total War games. Attila is a VERY DIFFICULT game. A first time Total War player would be better off trying Rome II or one of the earlier games than Attila, as Attila challenges the player not only on strategic battles, but also on economic, family, squalor, corruption and more. There are many things to keep track off in the game.

The gameplay itself is fun, and in battle sequences follow Rome II's quite closely, perhaps with the exception that cavalry may be more popular around this time. Performance is also a hot debate. While many have complained about Attila's performance, I myself had no issues. On the contrary, my performance is slightly better than what I had in Rome II. 

The few drawbacks of the game include some strange glitches that can make gameplay frustrating at times (such as allied factions pillaging your provinces). The game can also be very frustrating because of the defensive mentality you must have while playing the game, something I was not prepared for. Lastly, the game has a strange way of punishing the player without knowing what one did wrong. Also, CA's constant DLC releases is frustrating to fans of the series as it abuses their customer base.

Lastly, there are some very serious issues with the game at its current state. For one, the puppet states and parts of diplomacy are utterly broken at this moment. No matter how much your puppet states trust you, the moment someone declares war on you they turn on you and take your lands. Pretty much defeats the purpose of ever having a puppet state. The corruption system, while promoting more challenging gameplay, is also broken. Corruption can go above 100% in many provinces, resulting in heavy losses when it comes to income. It's utterly ridiculous. If I you have the patience, wait until a patch is released to resolve that issue.

All in all, if you like Total War and are hesitant to try it, then all I can say is that I still highly recommend it despite some of its temporary issues. You will have plenty of fun while playing the game and it will force you to be very strategic.

For the people complaining, of course they want money. They already released the game at $45 instead of $60 yet through hundreds of comments that I have read, nobody even mentions it. This means that you could purchase the game PLUS 2 DLC packs and only pay $61 in total... I spend more than $8 on lunch every day which is one of my 3 meals. If $8 is a lot to you, why are you paying $45 for a game in the first place? The only thing I don't agree with, is the Blood and Burning DLC.

Review:

Here's a list of things that I think should be pointed out.

Hordes: Some factions start in a migrating stage called a horde. A faction becomes a horde when there is still an army, but they do not own a settlement. A horde can make an ""encampment"" which is basically a temporary settlement. You can pick up and move, or just settle down wherever. It acts the same as a normal settlement, except the buildings are different.

Factions: The factions themselves are great. They really have one for every play style. The Roman Empire is split into two which consists of the East, and the West. If you've played Total War, you already know that the huge factions are harder to manage. There's also the Sassanid Empire which is essentially as big as both Roman factions, but more relaxed.  There are 2 barbarian type factions, 4 hordes (including huns). The Huns are crazy. They start out as a horde with a few near full armies of mostly cavalry. I can't really say much for late game because I like to swap factions all the time but..

DLC: Will find out shortly

Other Reasons:
-Fully dynamic and intense family tree. Political intrigue and backstabbing at its finest. Very detailed and in-depth
-You can rename your cities (inb4 childish city names as you play in Co-op)
-There are upgradable tiers for units - changing the names and looks
-They brought priests back
-Razing cities and Devastation
-Decimation (Like being in the command of Luigi Cadorna)
-Cool screen break going into battle, its like the cinemas
-Some animated videos and clips
-No date/time only achievements (yet)

Some personal reasons why you shouldn't get the game (just yet)
-No blood/gore, and no pack (yet)
-Can't scroll in to appreciate the action, sometimes you can, but in hills. Otherwise, your camera just hovers
-Lack of optimization, tends to favor the hordes. I heard cavalry is the answer-all to the game, but I have yet to see that proven, still, battling against the hordes take a while.

The sacking mechanic is asinine, the ability to sack an entire region with a single click in a single turn laying waste to everything over hundreds of square miles. Unit balance is all over the place, with many countries listed as normal difficulty, near impossible to play. Take the latest dlc for the Celts, they are largely useless against the western roman troops who are at this point supposed to be in trouble, but who can still field multiple full stacks seemingly out of nowhere. Unless of course you are playing as the Western Roman Empire them then you are scratching for troops at every turn to defend against the ai.

My advice: don't waste your time and money.  Until CA decide to pull their fingers out and iron out these problems, the game is literally unplayable for a number of people.

27,15053692,english,"I like this game, it's harder than Rome 2. The pace on the campaign map feels slower than Rome 2 but combat is similar. Battles are short and I think I would prefer if they were longer. 6000+ soldiers should not be able to slaughter each other in 10 minutes or less. Beyond that the game is really fun. I personally like that generals and statesmen seem to live for much longer than they did in Rome 2 as it makes them feel more imortant. Theres is much more to think about in this game than in Rome 2. Legions can rebel if they get bored or if you lose too many battles and governors are actual characters you select for thier attributes and they gain experience just like generals. The Horde mechanic is just cool, enemy vagabonds use the resources of the provinces they travel through and force you to deal with them or watch your empire slowly decline. I also like the addition of watch towers to non-capitol towns and the option to upgrade them to have walls. It just makes sense that a small town on the frontier of an empire would be somewhat fortified, regardelss of its size.

I have noticed some bugs and honestly, its mostly the same sloppy shit we got with Rome 2. It isn't game breaking but like many others I find it annoying that the game is not working properly at release.  

There were some CTD and random freezes but we can expect this to be ironed out within a year or two. Also, I threw down a barricade during a siege defense and instead of looking like a wooden pallisade it took on the textures of the grass and pavement below it. The camera glitches... alot. Basically, don't expect to move the camera over especially high terrain or some buildings as it will get caught and spin. You have to pause the game and click on the minimap to move the camera to another position. Incidentally, I can pause this game many times throughout a battle and not worry about a CTD like in Rome 2, which is nice. Others have said it and I will add my 2 cents as well; CA, you should not have released three DLC's so quickly with the game not working properly. I mean I get it, we're hooked on this franchise and I for one will probably buy the next title but seriously it would be nice of you to put out a fully functioning product you can be proud of instead of this. These are obvious bugs that were left in on purpose. 

Overall this is a  good Total War title and I look forward to playing it over the next few years.

I dont think i have any more playtime on a single gaming series and now to the bad part. 

Ever since Napoleon the DLC trend has angered me, i appreciate other series do it aswell but bare with me. I got more content with Darth mod on napoleon then with the DLC packs/game itself. Why would i pay £30 for a brand new game and then two weeks later a DLC comes out? At least be more subtle CA, anyone with half a brain cell can see that the content was ready/very nearly ready when the whole game was released, so know I am expected to shell out another £6 for a few more (very similar) factions that the AI have already been playing as? Basically proving the content was in the game when it was released. 

So im prepared to pay a little bit more as i know CA are a small PC only company.............Oh wait they just made Alien Isolation which was also on consoles, got great reviews and most importantly sold really well. So i am now not prepared to pay any more money until CA start to treat us with respect. Furthermore i logon to steam today and low and behold £1.99 for the ""blood and burning"" pack. So now i am expected to shell out more of my very hard earned cash to have blood in the game and enhanced fire effects? Could they not be added in a free update like pretty much any other decent PC gaming series? I just recieved alot more content for Men Of War Assault Squad 2 which is made by a very small developer all for free, just to be loyal to the players that bought that game. 

Seriously CA I appreciate the cost of game making is astronomical these days and I genuinely am a lot more forgiving then most 15 year olds trolls on the forums/steam but c'mon now you are just taking us all for a ride.

41,15049423,english,"I usually dont review games but due to the discontent consumers have for this game and the last, Rome 2, I feel I should.
Objectively there are many good things about this game, using the order that they used for their store page Ill list what I feel.

Apocalyptic destruction mechanics, this part of the game is new to any total war that i have played, and i have played most excluding shogun 1 and 2. The only issue with this is that your army can get so terribly weak that a unit with 30 melee attack can be at much less than half of its strength at the BEGINING of a battle. Another issue is that if you are playing with battle limits and you are defending, a viable strategy might be to wait inside a walled settlement and see if the enemy come in range. This is useful when facing a much larger army but if that army does not want to come to you and the time limit nears completion, the smaller army will face a morale loss and may even route and run outside the walls to their deaths without your command. wonderful.

Legendary start position This is probably the hardest start position i have ever played across any total war game. It is incredibly hard since you are completely open to nomads and you may not even be able to field enough armies to fight them off.

Overhauled game mechanics You remember that cool civil war you fought in Rome 2? Mine only lasted about 3 turns but hey it was a suprise. See the issue here is that if you fight one civil war you will probably fight two or three more pretty damn soon. The loyalty system requires you to spend gravitas to keep people in line but since you lose gravitas you also lose control and thus suffer negative penalties. You spend gravitas to avoid penalties but spending gravitas gains penalties. yup. Would have been a cool thing if it wasnt done so oddly. I just adopt everyone so their is only one family and then hey whatever man. ill never look at that page again.

Incredible period detail  This is true for a little while but the issue is that this is history, remember when all of italy became a barren wasteland that is no where near fertile? the entire east became near uninhabitable when the rot grasped the land? No? well that incredible period detail only lasts a little while. No matter how long you play things will only get worse and never better so food is definitely a large worry.

Outstanding visual fidelity they did truly do something lovely here. They made a graphics setting that is meant for the future. You guessed it, instead of fleshing out the game for the present they made settings for the future. So in 3 years when your computer is good enough to play on the best settings you will have no new content left to play unless you are willing to buy 15 dollars worth of content that could have been in the game. One of my favorite childhood games was dynasty warriors, i remember vividly having to actually beat the game to unlock content. Now its so much better that i get to buy stuff i already payed for to play the game i bought.

Attila is, for me, the best iteration since Medieval 2 - it's a great game, it really is, BUT....

In roughly 20 days, 3 culture pack DLC's have been released at 7.5 euros each. Content, which should have been in at release. To be honest the games one shortcoming is it's lack of playable factions. And it seems this is because they plan on milking everyone with culture pack after culture pack.

I would no longer recommend Attila as you're going to end up paying 60+ euros to get the full experience at this point. Probably, within a few months we're talking 100+ euros. And it's not worth anywhere near this. If you couple this with the fact that the gamemechanics that make TW games truly good, are just as good or better in the older games - i would reccomend you to get Medieval 2 +expansions for way less(or Empire/Shogun 2). Also, the older releases have very polished overhauls/mods available from communitysites that vastly increase their quality/value.

Attila Total War position the players in the beggining of the end of the ancient times - The fall of the Western Roman Empire - and in the beggining of the middle ages. In the game, we have many new features of whom you have many optinons of building your empire - or developing your horde. Though you can build your empire, Attila Total War is a game of which the timeline isnt good for building empires - instead, it's time for destroying them. With many barbarians hordes, and traditional empires, it's all up to you. Will you conquer and expand or raze and pillage? Your option.
The game presents many good and relevant changes from the past total war games, incorporating features from the old classic total war games to the atual games. Altought it has the same engine as Rome 2 : Total War, it has many features, explaining the need of a new game and not a dlc, like Napoleon was to Empire.

52,14532189,english,"Yes!  A decent introductory campaign you can burn through in a handful of hours teaches you the basics.  There are many of the good things from Rome 2, but many changes and tweaks.  Money and food numbers have been increased so that there can be better differentation between buildings.  So many religions, but the ability to convert.

Stuff.  Looks.  Beautiful.  Even a wall-less half burned village makes you want to pause the game and check out all the background animations.  Missile fire looks like black blobs of smoke streaking across the map...one minor meh.  Otherwise this is a true joy to look at both in combat and the strategic maps.

So many tweaks that this is not just Rome 2 rehash.  Need to put in at least 40 hours before I can give a nuanced review but right now I am a happy camper.

ONE PROBLEM:  The online encyclopedia is just as stupid and slow as Rome's was.  Instead of just letting you see what YOUR nation can build, you have to see everyeone's buildings.  So hard to make informed decisions on what to build (that will get simpler with time of course).  Key concepts are not listed in manual and can't find a search function.  IE:  What is religion osmosis? (I can figure it out that it involves transfer of religion but what makes one religious building option better than another?  DUnno...there isn't even the world osmosis in the manual.)   I hate the damn thing...why not organise it to only show what you can make?  I could never understand that in Rome 2.

If you like TW games, you should like this.  Can't wait to play one of the larger nations in trouble...the WRE from Rome:Barbarian Invasion was one of my favorite scenarios in the entire series.

Additional notes 3/25/15

TLDR: If you like ""vikings"", Attila > Rome. Attilla is in the throes of MASSIVE climate change, everyone is burning their provinces into dust, and the Huns are coming...so this one isn't as sand-boxy as Rome is, but complexity, depth, looks, etc...Attilla wins hands down. But get Rome on sale when you can (they just had 75% off sale somewhere)...it you want a more civ-style sandbox game, or want to play Egypt or any of the excellent cultural groups that are not in Attila.

More in depth:

While I have quite a few hundred hours into Rome 2 (into each and every TW game from the first one), and they were all good, Attilla is a a different game than RTW2 and mechanics-wise, much more detailed in many ways...politics, settlement building, battle, etc. The battlefields that include settlements are just georgious and much more interesting to fight on than Rome's. There are also ways to become migrating tribes which are pretty cool, though I haven't tried it outside the extensive tutorial.

Two things may make you pick Rome over Attila:

1. Climate change: One of the major factors in gameplay is that climate change renders eventually 2/3 the map infertile. It requires you to push south because you can't grow enough food in your northern provinces which takes a huge bite out of your finances as well as forcing you to waste more space on food production. Couple this with the ability to raze provinces, and it becomes very hard to find a decent amount of fertile land. Corruption is quite high too, so bad that you may be tempted if you start in a northern climate to just raze your startling territory and just head south for new lands. You really need to keep the big picture in mind because if you're unaware how drastic the fertility goes down you're going to be spending way too much time and effort building up what should be treated as a starting point, not the heart of your empire.

2. Hun hordes. If you didn't play Medieval War 2, You may not realize just how tough these guys are going to be. Lots of armies. Strong armies. The only thing going for you is that they can't take over settlements, just raid or raze them. I like to expand West and let the Eastern empires be my buffer. (edited...can't tell my left from my right duh)

If you like vikings, Attlia > Rome. I like the viking fathers DLC. Your troops are not as buff as the Roman troops in some ways, but you have a lot of fear-producing troops and you want to hit hard and fast, get the enemy running. Your meat and potato troops evolve with tech from levy troops to some seriously decent killers...but become so expensive that you may want to do what I did...train up your garrison armies just before the next troop upgrade happens, then keep those armies off the front lines until you need top tier troops with twice the upkeep.

There are some things I don't like about Attilla. Documentation sucks, the online encyclopedia is slow and a lot of really important data (like the interplay of politics, what do certain buildings do, etc) are not shown anywhere. BUT, once you play enough you'll pick things up. The political system is the best one in a TW game yet...you really need to take it into account, and the number of options you have means you can really spend time optimizing your leaders and balancing your family so they are in power, but not seen as a threat to the natural order. The RPG feel of the older TW games is back, IMO. There are leaders that I roll my eyes over ""Oh, HE is causing me problems again"". Even enemy leaders have social traits though I haven't gotten into diplomacy through assasination to more tractible leaders yet.

Diplomacy is a lot more difficult too; granted I have never been a player throwing around big bribes like some folks like to do, but man do people hate you.",1424280351,1427258812,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197966721701,432,37,60094,0,7659,1501865029,,

Haven't played much yet, but the diplomacy seems to actually work this time around, one nice feature is that the factionleaders personalities has an effect. All in all I'm happy with this, though I sort of miss the movie sequences when using spies.

And battles, HOLY FUCK, first battle I played was just complete chaos, men (and women I discovered) running around shouting, fighting, arrows everywhere, spears everywhere and the AI actually tries to flank me, not in the predictable all the other games way, but actually flanking and almost beating the shit out of me.

Second battle, this time my small reconisance force gets attacked by a much larger force (didn't have any spies yet) I decide to hide atop a hill in the middle of a forrest, placing spearmen, where I want the enemy to go, placing my general close to them, placing archers a bit further up the hill using flaming arrows, then I send my (only) cavalery unit to set the trap, it works a placement of the enemy army charges after my horses who hide in the woods and with the enemy in range I let my archers loose, and HOLY FUCK AGAIN!

65,15016712,english,"Great and vast improvement over previous total war titles. Many new systems introduced including land fertility, which as the game progresses the winters get harsher, bringing down the fertility of the land, and this leads to the 2nd cool new feature, the migratory system. Factions from the north as the fertility rate drops may look to migrate to warmer more fertile lands in the south, playing as one of these factions should you choose to uproot, you'll have to natigate your people through others lands, or ravage your way across the map to where you want to settle, which of course is already occupied, very interesting things going on with these new mechanics. There is a hord system now, which the Huns use, however any faction can pick up and become a hord.

This game takes place as the Roman empire has been split in two, with the Western Roman Empire and the Eastern Roman empire. By this point the Western Roman empire is on the verge of collapse, which makes playing as them extremely challening. The AI has been vastly improved with this title as well, I'm a veteran total war player and used to kicking butt across the map, however as of the 11 battles I've fought so far, I've actually lost 5 of them! So great improvment upon the AI, especially the battle AI. There is a new fire mechanic wich is freaking awesome, you an set any building upon fire, and the fire spreads to other buildings. You can sit back with enough archers and catapults and burn a city to the ground as opposed to taking it if you wanted.

THE FLAWS:

- Slow run speed.  I turned this thing to full ram and it still felt like I was moving through a swamp covered with molasses.

- Arrows look dumb.  Take a hint from Rome 1 and make them look decent again, or better yet, don`t show them at all.

- Campaign feels sloppy.  When I want to build a farm, I don`t want to have to sort through 3 provinces and then choose which farm makes the most f*cking sense.  This isn`t supposed to be rocket science.  Rome 1 had a simple, better and better building system that made sense.  This male cow defication just ruined my experience.

-  The Campaign map is impossible to explore, and I feel lost every game with this 3 provinces garbage.

- Advisor is ugly and annoying.  I hate his ugly voice.  I hate his ugly face.  I hate his ugly hood.  I hate this advisor.  Bring back the girl from Rome 1.

- Total War Launcher has to be the stupidest idea.  What autistic monkey came up with that thing, I wonder.  I don`t want a launcher on top of steam, with info that`s already on the steam update`s section.  

- Units feel awkward.  They look nice, but one can`t even admire the battles because there`s too much crap happening, blocking the way.  It`s like Total War forgot everything it learned from Shogun and Rome, threw it out the door and wanted to try something new and dumb.

As i said before i cant play the online, i did host a game with my friend and played some turns but not enough to have a real review, hey should add giving regions since i took one for my friend, and we ended the game cause i  couldn't. the ai is also very stubborn, i took the captial of the franks and saxons i two turns, neither wanted peace even though both only had troop deep inside western roman turff, so they awould almost never get their land back.

80,14982924,english,"Having played since Shogun 2 I can say that I've seen some definite improvement in the AI over time. Shogun 2 was generally decent, but holding settlements was ridiculously easy as the AI could be kited to death without trouble. Rome 2 the AI seemed to have gone down, maybe it was the larger scale. I also didn't care for the units and it just seemed all around clunkier. I cannot quite explain it, but somewhere along the line Attila fixes most of these problems and the more subtle ones I was never aware of so it seems like a much more fluid game.

Steamrolling early game is not a viable tactic anymore, holding terrotories and reinforcing is much more important now. AI seems a lot smarter about attacking and doesn't appear to waste units anymore. The migratory system is very well done and presents a different but similar play style. Although it is very hard to recover after losing an army in migratory. This game just seems so much more immersive than Rome 2. Really don't know why. Agent spam is also down from the ridiculous Shogun 2 levels.

Edit: The one issue I do have is the ridiculous DLC that CA is charging. Three different $8 packs with factions that are already in the game? Really CA? I'm all for content but this is just some reskinned units with different names and stats, not real content.

81,14970621,english,"First a little note about the DLC controversy. I am ignoring all the DLC drama that happened with this game, and writing a review about the game itself. But I will take a moment to discuss my thoughts on the DLC scandal. I would like to add that I am dumb and bought the DLC, I didn’t understand that all the DLC did was unlock factions, I thought it was adding in some story line “scenario” like missions in addition to unlocking the Viking factions for the grand campaign. I understand the communities frustration with these launch day DLCs. I feel the same way now, and after this I will no longer buy launch DLC or any shortly after release DLC. This DLC crap has gotten out of hand, and I really miss the good old days with expansion sets. I am ok with DLC released like 6 months later that adds a lot more to your overall experience. But 8 bucks to unlock some factions on day 1? They can piss right off with that. You used to be able to unlock factions in TW games by beating them! This is pretty shameful. I understand game companies are not charity organization and need to make money, but do so in a non sleazy way and keep your integrity. Now enough on the DLC let’s get to the review of the game itself.

I understand that this is a stand alone expansion to Rome 2. I never played Rome 2 as all the negative reviews and horrible launch scared me away from it. So I have no way of comparing the two. The last TW game I was heavily into was Empire/Napoleon. I did not enjoy Shogun 2.
Total War: Attila is fucking good. Actually scratch that it’s fucking GREAT! This was a TW game I was waiting for. The graphics are beautiful, I am a huge fan of the new campaign map, and really dig the idea of provinces. It makes it much easier to manage your empire. The new “razing’ choice for captured cities is satisfying, and leads to many strategic opportunities with that. A clan management system has been included as well, giving you a Game of Thrones like mini game. It includes features such as choosing heirs, assassinations, bids for power, money laundering, adoption, and arranged marriages. It is just amazing and such a fun feature to have. Also there is now a “nomad” system for migrating hordes like the Visigoths, where you can manage your faction with nomad specific buildings that travel with your hordes. The Huns are exclusively only nomadic, so you cannot settle with them. So this system helps greatly with the fun of being a horde and you can take your time trying to find the perfect place to settle with the migrating barbarians. Also at any point you can say it’s fuck this shit o clock and burn all your towns and become a migrating horde. For the Huns a strategic option since you are nomadic, is that you can subjugate conquered nations, this will provide you with some passive income, however you do have to keep them happy or they will rebel. I decided to be ruthless and just burninated everybody and their thatched roof cottages to the ground though, no rebellions when you are dead….

As far as the grand campaign goes, for once you feel vulnerable, like you are out to survive this oncoming onslaught, especially if you play as West or East Rome. Most Total War games it’s quite the opposite you usually are the beginnings of a super power and it’s time to conquer. If you play as the germanic barbarian factions it’s all out civil war, but Rome is always ripe for the pillaging and can provide you with some quick cash. The only faction that feels like you are playing a true up and coming super power is the Sassanid empire, they are by far the easiest faction to play. Other than that it is a game of survival, and once you are able to overcome the early mess of the game and get your economy going then you can start thriving. I actually find this game difficult. I do not pretend to be a genius at strategy games and as much as I love strategy games I will always hit a certain wall in skill, I mostly played on normal and it took me quite a few starts and restarts to truly begin to have some shred of success. I hope this game sufficiently challenges some of you five star arm chair generals out there, but for a lowly peon like myself the AI was bending me over like I was being interviewed on the casting couch.

The RTS side of things has not changed much, other than a great overhaul to sieges and defenses. The extra towers you get shooting at your foes, is a welcome boon, and as an attacker the different strategic points you can move your troops to and overtake is also a big help to winning. Fire now plays a bigger role, and can really hinder the morale of your opponents. Other than those changes it’s good old total war, troop formations, cavalry charges, missile units, and siege weapons. The naval battles are disappointingly still bland, and your best off hitting auto resolve. Use overwhelming numbers if you go heavy with naval units, because playing out an RTS combat match with naval forces to me is like getting a root canal.

Let’s discuss some flaws. Right now this game is poorly optimized in it’s current state. It is going to rape your gaming PC unless you have something brand spanking new. I have a 2 year old custom PC, and I have had some severe frame rate issues. First game I have had to tune down my graphics for not including the Crysis series. Not that the game looked bad with a blend of medium and high graphics, it still looked great! I am experiencing some lockups, weird graphical glitches, and some random crashing. I think the graphics engine is very clunky and could use a bit of additional tuning. I hear NVIDIA and AMD have patches coming out to help with that. I also got annoyed with the whole “ATTILA WAS BORN OMG” cinematic that pop up during your campaign. I understand they wanted to focus on Attila and this little everybody thinks the Huns are bringing the apocalypse story, but it got old fast. I mean you can hit ESC when the movie starts playing, but I would rather the game spend that time on loading my damn turn. The Huns most of the time were not a big deal since I was mostly spending my time over in Germany, British Isles, and Spain. In fact one time I even had Attila marry my daughter in an arranged marriage between our factions and he was a part of my family and I was now able to pay the Huns a meager sum anytime I wanted somebody wiped out or distracted. For new players the game has a weak tutorial prologue, it really is not going to help somebody start out with this game, this game is tough. If you are curious or new to Total War, your best bet is to go watch some experienced players on you tube and their let’s play videos. Only way you will learn and be successful, other than that you are more than likely going to die.

In closing I recommend this game to anybody who loves the Total War series or grand campaign strategy games. It’s a must have, and it will keep you occupied for hours on end. They did a great job with it and really listened to the community feedback from Rome 2 from what I have read. Even with the shameful DLC drama I would still recommend you buy this game. But don’t waste your cash on the DLC unless it’s on sale for a dollar or something. I think Total War: Atilla will be a game that will be looked upon as a good come back for the franchise, and one I will play off and on for years to come.",1426847847,1426915912,True,3,0,0.530386745929718018,0,True,False,False,76561197961638740,203,11,5536,0,4914,1487458664,,

85,14753123,english,"I absolutely love what this game has done to the series. I love this game, which is strange seeing as I also absolutely hate this game for exactly the same reasons. Let's start at the beginning as that's the only way any of this will make sense. First thing that you see when you open the game is a moving background, something I've missed sense Medieval 2:Total War. If you have no idea what game I'm talking about stop reading this review right now and just skim the reviews on the games page. That game is easily the most hilarious game of the series and I am dying for the next one to come out. I love how everything, from the campaign selection down to the battle screen is styled compared to Rome 2's clear black boxes. I really helps me get into the feel of the game which I'll bring up latter. First thing you must know when looking over all the cool factions that are still nations today is that this game is Nintendo Hard. Creative Assembly must have had a mountain of complaints about the AI. Well just like the Romans built a mountain of dirt to siege the Hebrews, CA built a mountain of difficulty to start whittling down your complaints. I found myself struggling on “Easy”, you know the one that says “For players new to strategy games.” it took me 3 tries after setting on a faction to get started without backing myself into a corner, mainly because all of your neighbors start with just as big of an army as you and everyone who isn't at war with somebody at the word go has little insentive to leave their only city undefended. The campaign map has been redone so every province is uniform to 3 settlements. That's one thing that always got to me in Rome 2, I really liked how they added provinces. It felt like a new and meaningful addition but the fact that they ranged from 2 to 4 settlements made it seem that the smaller ones were worthless, because of how difficult it was to manage public order with fewer build slots. A lot of that work for a little return. With all of them the same, reasonable size we don't have that problem any more. The campaign map feels about the right size and scope, but I found my armies taking literal years to get from one side of the my kingdom to the other by the end. It simple became more effective to disband an entire army and retrain them at my home province whenever upgrades were available. Along with the AI, the battles were stepped up tenfold. 1st tier units suck, they have no armor or abilities, they brake all the time, and run away like it's going out of style. One time I found my guys fleeing even though I was wining, and it was a decisive victory too! Sieges are way better, defenders have barricades and attackers can burn down the settlements, or you could simply slaughter your way to the center of the settlement on top of a hill watching all of your guys die horribly from whatever dark age flaming-arrow sniper corp that happens to reside in every arrow tower. It's brutal. Diplomacy stays the same thought, with people refusing to trade unless you have the very specific trade resource they want or are already Super Friends. I also found it strange that people who you completely displace will try to fight you to the bitter end even if you do it in one turn, but you can steal half of another faction's country and and be trading with them 3 turns later just because you've been a bigger bully to all of the people they hate just as much. I don't like how factions are so ready to burn settlements to the ground, but they also reclaim them if it's the easiest place to expand which I found pretty cool. As far as a “survival strategy goes”, I mean it's fun, but it's just not scary. I found myself more annoyed at the AI that afraid of any impending wrath or coming apocalypses. Migratory factions are a really nice idea, but I feel like it should be limited; instead of being everyone but the Romans, Sassanids, and Huns (Read: Barbarians). I often found myself chasing down a random faction who's 1 settlement I took simply because now the where a hoard instead of an refugee army of a conquered people. The family tree is a welcome return and the political system has been redone to be more complicated. You want to be in power, but not too much. You have Dominion which is how many of the nobles are in your family and Control which is how much the royal court listens to you, this determines your Power. Around “Balanced” or “Respectable” is usually best. People don't have Gravatas in this one they have Influence, which you get for generals by having them fight and statesmen/governors just from sitting there but at a slower rate. You spend your Influence on political actions, mostly to promote your guys to an office for bonuses, marry someone for trait bonuses, ensure loyalty, or steal money. It's important not to make all of of your guys either generals or governors, but a mix of both to get the best effects of influence and to being betrayed by your own armies. People can only get to a higher office by serving in a lower one first, which make sense. But you need offices filled because it proves bonuses to that individual character AND to your faction as a whole. Way better than the basic set up from Rome 2.

I'll only compare it to the ones I have a through knowledge of ; Medieval 2, Shogun 2, and Rome 2.
I was ecstatic to see the return of the moving home screen and family tree from Medieval 2 as the seem like features that never really made sense to exclude. I appreciate the generalization of forces akin to Shogun 2 as I often found in the other games that you either had an awesome army roster OR and awesome start location, but never both. I enjoy the artistic carry over form Rome 2 and how they built upon it with the crumbling empires theme they got going. Those unit cards though, 3-D pictures of the unit in an action pose? I'm looking at you Shogun 2: Fall of the Samurai! The ultimate question though is: “Is Total War: Attila it's own game, or just a glorified redux of everything Rome 2 could have been?” The short answer is: no. The long answer is that it takes everything form the most recent Total War titles and combines it in a way I didn't thing CA would in a time period few explore. A big argument I see is that it FEELS just like Rome 2. Not a tributary states chance at Divine Triumph I say! With Rome 2, as with all the other games I felt like I was expanding ever outward towards an ultimate goal of supreme dominance. Here? I feel lucky to be alive, followed by periods of glorious wars stopped short by having to pacify my populace with heavy investments into infrastructure, ending with becoming the most powerful nation-state in history destroying so many enemies at once I forget about them still being at war with me until they decide to try and siege a far-off place of mine as one of my armies of living war gods takes all of their land between them and the siege. At the very end  I came to s sudden realization. I'm fighting both Romes and wining, I've displaced and destroyed countless factions, the Huns are married into my family and all the remaining nomads answer to me. I'm the real villain here! All said and done it made me feel like a real dark age ruler; be it a barbarian king, Roman emperor, or nomadic warlord!  ...instead of you the guy controlling (Faction Name Here) playing a game.

Summary:
I like it. Not the best strategy game ever, but a fine Total War if ever I saw one. Solid 8.4 out of 10. Solid.

-Pros:
-All the Factions are cool
-Looks great
-Uses a normally untouched area of history
-Uses some of the best features of all the recent Total War games
-Units and Factions are diverse enough to be different, but samey enough to be balanced
-It's difficult, but very fun

-Khans:
-The Huns will end you if you don't devote your heart, soul, and first born to fight them all at the same time
-Still has some technical problems preventing smooth game play
-It's difficult, but not scary",1425606023,1426872874,True,4,0,0.497710168361663818,0,True,False,False,76561198047476364,1360,4,57702,0,12137,1599915531,,

To date this is my favorite title of the entire series of total war games.  I did not like Rome 2, at first I did but going on hour 10 and more into the game my opinion started to diminish.  That is for numerious reasons, different title, I am not going to get into that.  However it seems to me that Attila is the real materialization of the vision behind Rome 2.  This is coming from the media pieces and such that I have seen with regards to Rome 2 and some about Attila.  With all that being said I will get into the things I really enjoy about this game.

Some old mechanics are back, such as the family tree.  Very cool cause the internal dynamic of your entire has stuff going on and CA has really implemented some meaning things here.  Its almost like there is a mini game here that impacts the bigger picture.  We got layers, and they seem useful.  It is not perfect by any means and there are things that can be done here, but what they have works. 

The battles are what you would expect no surprise there and they are as satisfying as they have been.  There are a few small things that really complement this department, such as details and and sieges.  What I like most about the battles is the different play styles and troops.  I can be succesful with many different styles and I haven't really seen this in any other total war game.  That is why this is my favorite of all of them.  Sure Rome 2 had a bunch of different troops but create an army of heavy roman inf and they are pretty much unstoppable.  In attila you got four real different styles of combat, which really adds ""flavor"" to the game.  To give background about myself, I am a hard to very hard type player, and i usually like playing factions that have harder than normal starting positions.  I could have completely dropped the ball in all the other games and missed this aspect of them by a long shot, who knows. 

In this title I feel like I am getting more of a complete package of grand strategy.  I have to deal with numerious things all in all that have not taken away from my desire to crush an army in tactical combat.  

Now from some of the things I do not like.  

Having close to 140 hours, I would say the first 20 were tough as I was trying to figure out how the game plays out. I like to think I am quite familar with total war and this game can be quite punishing.  I almost want to say there is a more linear way to which this game plays out for alot of the factions. Linear as in there are a good number of things you should do otherwise you are going to get punished.  There are alot of factions in this game although we are only given a taste, which im sure will be release more and more with DLCs (which in my opinion is actually good business), I just dont like it.  It is pretty hard to find things in this game that I don't like, as I am sure there are tons of internet people that could go on for hours and hours bashing and bashing.  Yeah there are alot of things that could be done to this game im sure, but it is pretty darn good. I definitely recommend it! For those not familar with grand strategy this game has a learning curve but not as bad as some titles out there. 

Out of five stars, i give attila 4.75",1426817483,1426817483,True,1,0,0.499235838651657104,0,True,False,False,76561198008105365,121,3,35424,0,8527,1551587111,,

I wanted to love Total War: Attila, and in many ways I do, as the gameplay has improved, battle AI is smarter, family trees are back and the presentation is of a very high standard. Attila is ideal for those who want a greater challenge than Shogun 2 or Rome 2, since merely surviving is the aim for most of the game, and in this sense Attila gets the setting spot on. Unfortunately, in spite of having the trouble free launch its predecessor was missing, the similarity of many factions and units combined with an incremental DLC-heavy approach to improving the game mean that all but the most die hard Total War fan will feel a little aggrieved and I would recommend waiting until the price goes down or a newer edition with more content is released.

It's an above average game, so I would happily recommend it. Just not at full price.

+ Improved battlefield AI
 + Excellent presentation
 + New ideas that build on Rome 2 and the earlier Barbarian expansion's hordes
 + Much greater challenge than other Total War games
 + The chaos of the campaign game makes it feel like the end times, as people did in Late Antiquity

 - Poor optimisation
 - Doesn't represent good value for money
 - Many of the factions and units feel identical
 - UI changes feel like a step back
 - Campaign AI is still cheap, even more so with razing

93,14965122,english,"This is the best mix between the Total war games Medieval 2, Shogun, and Rome 2. You have a family tree that you can do a lot of interacting with (family tree like from Medieval 2, interactive like Rome 2). The problem with Rome 2 is the political instigations were impossible to figure out and didn't really affect anything after the first 20-30 turns. The best it took from Shogun was enable you to recruit very useful agents and when generals and agents leveled up you could choose their specializations. My only wish is that they let you have some more agents, aparently you have to wait until you build the most advanced building (which is at the end of the research trees, hence takes a long time to get to) in the chain that allows you to recruit a unit. A lot is taken from Rome 2 since the time period is the beginning of the end of the Roman empire. For you diehard Total War Fans lets face it, for all the total war games the most fun battle play was Medieval 2. Perhaps in Medieval 2 your Generals were very leathal and had a huge impact in battle (which is probably unrealistic). I had so much fun in Medieval 2 watching 6 groups of crossbowmen chew away at the approaching army, and above all watching a heavy cavalry charge and decimate an entire group of infantry. In Attila it is more realistic and fun to play through the battles. Your archers have the ability to use 3 different types of arrows which is very cool and it tells you what effects will happen when you change the type of arrow. Your catapults are much more effective and can help a lot in a battle. The one glitch I have noticed in Attila is if you adopt members from the 'other' families they dont show up in your family tree and thus are not able to use their political instigations.

In Medieval 2 and Rome you started with a few of the factions, but you unlocked the rest by beating the game, and in my view this was a perfect system - it made you play through multiple campaigns as different factions with goal of unlocking all factions.
This is not the case any more, now, you have the few factions shipped with the game (conveniently factions like the picts are nowhere to be seen) and in order to get the other factions you have to fork out £5.99 per culture pack. This is getting beyond absurd, I wont be purchasing any DLC for the game, nor will I purchase the next title without much deliberation and a few months after release.

22,14940425,english,"I think this is my first review. But I must say, i'm impressed with Attila. It has it's kinks that, knowing CA will be worked out...eventually. 
First off, it is very challenging, compared to the previous Total War games. The very beginning for most factions, being the most important and arguably, the most challenging in terms of how you will bet set up for your entire campaign. If you screw up in the first few turns, your entire game could end up being a hundred times harder. I like that. I like that actual thought and consideration of future possabilities is needed. In Rome 2, your first to tenth turn was usually easy and straight forward. Not in Attila!
Secondly, being able to raze settlements is pretty nice as well. I will point out, the AI does abuse this mechanic. And that needs to be changed. But strategically? You can create buffer zones, use it as a last ditch effort to get some income, or just do it to get rid of a city that was too hard to occupy due to cultural differences, then come back later and colonize the area. Something that I had always wished previous Total War games would employ.
And lastly, multiplayer seems more active and more fun. I will note, some balance needs to be brought in, and eventually it will be. (I hope.) 

So to sum it all up, Attila takes the best of Rome 2, and builds upon it. It still has it's issues with the AI doing annoying, or stupid things and some online stuff. But it's nothing that should disuade you from playing the game.  Wait for it to go on sale if you'd like, but seriously, give Attila a try! If you liked Rome 2 you'll love it. And if you hated Rome 2, but still liked other Total War games, this is a step up. If the DLC flood bothers you, ignore them. As is, Attila is just fine. 

Here's a video of my first serious campaign, where I discuss some of the stuff I do, and don't like other than what I just stated above.

   The game is not without its flaws however, the most glaring of which is the practice of selling DLC on the day of launch which should have obviously  been included in the vanilla release itself.    Another problem the game suffers from, is a lack of genuine diversity in the barbarian cultures. I would have liked to have seen more culturally specific units and building types. At some point I stopped playing the diffrent barbarian races as they all started to feel the same to me.

46,14912175,english,"   Graphics are much better even though I don't have the lastest and greatest card, mine is 2-3 years old.
   Combat AI is much improved. The computer puts up a better fight.
   
    I am very aggravated by some of the random appearing personal traits that show up. Such as your King, for no apparent reason, suddenly gets the red Unjust trait, which lowers integrity and provincial happiness across your entire realm. I have to reload the save that I make, at the end of each turn, and end the turn, over and over again, until it doesn't show up.
    Also, the Blind trait seems to appear on your best general making him completely worthless, reducing his stats, to the point to where you just have to take his troops away and send him out to die so you can be rid of him.
   Also, the minus one loyalty if your nobles don't get the same or better position each time... companion, judge,etc.
   
   And the Campaign AI can be really weird sometimes. 
   I'm playing the Francs and had managed,to get rid of all the nearby realms that, I would never be able to get along with. Also I had made trading partner, military access, allies out of the rest. Had a nice buffer zone against the Huns or anyone else I figured.
    And I had already exterminated most of the other migrating rats, such as the Magyars.
    Since I had alliances, I would highlight them on the political map, and  head out after them. I would usually have a couple of my allies, that liked me alot, send an army after them also.
   Exterminating the rats was a good thing also because, the paths they traveled were nothing but devestation, and realms that hated them. So alliances and access was fairly easy to get from the surviving realms along the path.
   With that fairly secure position explained then you'll understand why what the AI suddenly did would tend to bother you.
   Suddenly each turn my allies just started destroying their Province and going horde. So of course I lost trade with the Geats,Jutes, and Bungarians, That was some significant wealth lost plus allies that would send out armies with me to irradicate rat problems, when they appeared. They had nowhere to go so they just died off travelling around where they weren't wanted 
   Now the huns start to make their appearance in force toward the western Germantic tribes, My forces have just completed getting rid of the Picts, Caledonians, and, the Britains that were really western Rome leftovers. The Irish are great buddies and even converted to my religion.
   All of that is fine but I don't understand why those 3 tribes went mobile just to die wandering around without even the attempt to put up a fight or send out forces to take a settlement somewhere else in the known world. The Huns at that point were still way east messing with the Eastern Romans.
   So anyway I've got my two main forces back on the mainland heading towards exterminating the most dangerous rat breed, the Huns. Rugians are tagging along with 2 armies. I'll begin to see how this all turns out, now that I'm done with this short review. LoL.
   Overall lots of fun and much more, if they get rid of the ridiculous negative traits, that show up out of the blue, and quit making tribes go mobile and commit suicide. You can't support much after the climate change in the Northern regions, with the one sizeable goat herd per town, that you are stuck with, if you don't want to be diseased. But that's better than Nothing so why go mobile?

53,14733485,english,"I so desperately wanted to like this game and yet I have never felt such rage as this. The diplomacy function is useless, no one wants to trade with you, make peace with you, do anything with you. Random factions across the map declare war, then ten turns later a full stack or two appear on your door step and you're screwed. With five settlements you might be able to field 1.5 stacks, with one settlement the enemy can field two full stacks, a decent chunk of which are mercenaries. When you use the encyclopaedia to look things up (such as what buildings you need for which units) it doesn't tell you, at least not that I've found.
Raiding your lands (but not the settlement) isn't an act of war. Tributary states break away at will and declare war on you at will. The Sassanids are so overpowered it is a joke, their satrapies seem to do all their fighting (and winning). Trade is pointless as it doesn't give you enough income to bother trying. Your threat level seems to increase with each turn, even if your empire/army size is not. The longer you last the more people hate you regardless of how big or powerful you are. Alliances are pointless, no one has come to my aid when I've asked and when I've declined to come to theirs they just declare war. The units are all the same for most factions, in both styling and colours. Recently resettled provincial capitals can somehow last for three years under siege.
Essentially what it comes down to is you'll be punished for being successful. I never ask anyone to help me in war but as the Sassanids your satrapies will often decline to declare war and therefore calim independence. As such they then go all Attila the Hun on you as you try to fight six different nations at once. One governor declared independence and a civil war started, this somehow dropped my inflow of food from 340 to -25. He had a single settlement, just one, and yet fields two full stacks of high end troops.

55,14896093,english,"A very enjoyable game. Now, I have only played a very glitchy Empire: Total War and Shogun II: Fall of the Samurai. Thus, I never played Rome II and have a different outlook on Attila than those who have.

I love it. No major glitches have been encountered. The strategical map is well done and thought out. There is always the roaming Huns and continuous ice age creep to keep you on edge rather than just get super strong immediately and steamroll everyone. The roaming band start for certain factions is very fun, giving a challange unique to Attila. There are multiple factions that, yes, do get based on some basic cookie-cutter armies (Germanic, Norse, Roman, etc.), but there is enough variation in units to keep them all interesting.

The battles are also smooth and epic. Now, I don't play multiplayer, but have heard that there are some large balance issues, I.E. calvalry is king of everything. This carries into single player. Bring horseys.

Also, note that most people who are giving this a downvote have put 50+ hours into the game.

61,14879376,english,"Total War Atilla is the latest and greatest title from developer Creative Assembly....

Napoleon is to Empire what Atilla is to Rome 2. CA managed to break the game they intended to release and released a followup title from a slightly later time period, attach the setting to revolve around a single character, and refine and add new game mechanics that should have been in the preceding title. 

In short; damage control. 

With that aside, removing Rome 2 from the picture, Atilla is a quality title. It provides probably the hardest campaigns I have played in a total war game. 

Part of this is due to the fact that the campaigns in this game were designed around survival as opposed to empire building. This is the dark ages! Plagues, famine, huns (and other enemies...) literally abandoning all reason and chasing your armies across Europe for no other reason than to give you gray hair...

The graphics are good and bad at the same time. The units appear a tad cartoony in my opinion. The terrain, weather, buildings, etc though are awesome.The game even runs pretty smooth (minus the bottlenecks in siege battles......shocker),

Naval battles are still pretty wonky though less so than Rome 2. Ramming has been removed except for special ramming ships. Transport fleets are now super squishy and can no longer stand toe-to-toe with navies. 

Politics are actually meaningful and more comprehensive. The family tree is back as well! The assigning of characters to be governors of provinces is also a nice feature here.

Each faction is engaging, especially with the new migration options and horde mechanics, it allows the player the option to make their own history nearly from scratch, whether one creates an Ostrogothic Persia or a Vandal Britannia or an Alani Scandinavia. 

On release, this game was and is leaps and bounds ahead of Rome 2 Total War as a comparison. Although, the game still has tweaks and fixes that are necessary, I am sure they will be fixed given time. There are some historical inaccuracies that will annoy history nerds, like myself,  but they aren't game-breaking. One example being the Alani tribe: in game their roster is almost entirely German as is their appearance, yet they are an Iranian Sarmatian tribe - closely related to the Roxolani and Iazyges tribes. Their appearance and roster should be more like that of the Rome 2 Nomads than what it is now. The Huns, at the moment, have more powerful infantry than they do cavalry - which is baffling. There aren't any Slavic, Celtic, Semitic, or African tribes (yet) but it's still possible they may release in the future with DLC.

My review will focus on the substance of this game. I notice a good portion of the bad reviews are focusing on marketing schemes and first-month DLC shenanigans, so I'll stay clear of that.

The Good:

CA listened to the community. It's the little things that add to the improvement from Rome II: you can ""draw"" lines to path the units; the unit cards make battles easier to command; and the Family Tree adds a political aspect (though linear) that wasn't seen in Rome II. It's not simply a game of ""who do I conquer next?"" No longer are you the lawnmower of Europe.  

To illustrate, in my game as the Franks, I found myself strategically forging alliances and razing settlements along my borders of little interest. I sacked for needed cash and to impede the enemy. That said, I also don't think this is a ""strategic survival game,"" as it's currently being marketed.  Once you reach mid-game and you have a decent sized empire, survival is no longer on the table. The game tends to revert back to firing up the lawnmower as you push East, West, or South. North if you're really crazy. 

All in all, gameplay mechanics are a step forward.

The Bad:

In one word: performance. While it's the small things that make the game good, it's the big things that hold the game back. Attilla is poorly optimized.  My rig is well above the recommended specs. Yes, I've read the articles indicating that the game is ""designed for the next series of GPUs."" I personally believe this is a cop out. A game like this should be designed for current high-end systems on the highest settings. If you're designing a game for systems that people won't have until two, three or five years down the road, you need to understand that that few will likely have interest in this title two, three of five years down the road. We'll probably have two more Total War titles by then. Will these also be designed for the next generation of GPUs? Make today's games for today's systems, tiered to appropriate levels of specs.

I may be the lone wolf believer on this, but I honestly think Rome II *looks* better than this game. The fact that the former runs better than the latter on my rig is disconcerting.  While we've taken a step forward in gameplay mechanics, we've taken two leaps backward in performance and graphics. The ""playability"" of the game is utterly diminished by the lack of smoothness in the battles and campaign map.

In another word: Rhogun. Imagine a world where Rome II's battle mechanics did the no-pants-dance with Shogun 2's campaign interface. That lovechild would be Attila. It's almost as if CA wrote on the whiteboard everything that was praised in Shogun 2 and lamented in Rome II. Net the positives and the negatives, this gives you Attila. So why is this a ""bad"" thing, you ask? Because there's very little new stuff here. Factor in Barbarian Invasion, there is essentially no new stuff here. Not that you're expecting a Total War game to redfine a genre - it does what it's supposed to do - but for a desinger that has the name ""Creative"" in its title, there is an utter dearth of that present in this product. Shogun II was able to expand on the fundamentals of the Total War franchise. We should keep the ball moving, not just dribbling between our legs.

The Hungly: 

Attila is a step forward in gameplay mechanics, a slide to the right in creativity, and a leap backward in performance. I'd define this as a thinking man's Rome II. I don't love it, but I can't hate it. I wish there was a button between ""Yes"" and ""No"" on the ""Do you recommend this game"" option.

99,14813208,english,"Just enough hours thus far to pass judgement. 

What Attilla does right: 

* High difficulty learning curve, even easy settings can promote an unpassable challenge

* Strong unit variation in late research amoung factions

* Audio and visual provides accurate steps forward as battle take place

* You won't master the game in several hours; this helps with longevity

What Attilla does wrong:


* Unblanced AI makes for unrealistic difficulty climbs during the campaign scenario

* Frustrating and cumbersome family and faction monitoring

* No matter how commited and powerful your allies are, they are never around when you need them most

* Frustrating aspects that can't be avoided make for a fast loss of all ground gained (faction rebels etc.)

* The campaign is far too occupied by factions that seem to reproduce even after defeated several times

* The game forces you into a nomadic position against forces that vastly outnumber your provences

* Even the strongest level of units buckle under the numbers that Attilla can throw at you

Conclusion, purchase the game if you want the greatest challenge of the Total War franchise...but be prepared to suffer great losses.

CA should for once listen to there fan bases BIGGEST complaint and stop squeezing our loyality and wallets for ""culture packs"" which are really just factions they wont give us for a full game expirence because they are starting to become like all other game studios who care more about profit and bank acc balances then there loyal consumers.

1) Gameplay much more difficult and immersive than possibly any other Total War game.
2) The UI changes were done, I think remarkably well
3) The overall immersion, the fire, the devastation, everything comming crumbling down, is fascinating.
4) Western Roman Empire campaign - nuff said
5) Commendable effort on historical settlements - they are both useful in the game, and historically accurate.
6) Unlike Rome 2, where heavy infantery ruled, here every type of the unit is usefull and often unit that on paper is the weakest will prove to be the most useful to you.
7) Few games can cause such frustration as well as such sattisfaction.
8) Concerns largely unexplored period of history.
9) More challenging AI

Cons
1) Horrific DLC practice. (This point alone is almost sufficient to  turn this review into negative) Suffice to say that I urge you not to buy any DLC.
2) AI cheats, it sustains armies it cannot sustain, it has settlements that would be starving and it seems to know exactly behind which tree is your army hiding.
3) There is no point in fighting Huns, if you destroy one of their armies, they will get another, new, fresh and very likely stronger, if you hold any settlements in eastern Europe, it is furthermore likely, that this ""new army"" will appear behind your lines and start attacking inmediatly).
4) There are way to few units for each faction (Don't you dare utter the word DLC)
5) The game needs some tweaking with food, public order, sannitation, and immigration (impossible to manage, boost to income, which drastically reduces your public order), unfortunately it seems we cannot expect these tweaks from CA.

Notes to the CA
1) Stop releasing those DLC's, even if it would mean making the full game £15 more expensive.

Case in point. 

1) When towns and provinces go up in flames and get completely burnt there should be an auto feature to allow the town to grow to an entry level town with a new country invoved. This will help with the gameplay when you have no one to play with after everything gets burnt, becuase no one wants to play alone.

27,14785853,english,"Pros: 
- New features that can lead to fun experiences
- Different ai than most total wars though not the best makes it a fun learning experience for veteran total war players
- Bigger map
- More in depth politics similar to original Rome ( makes it feel less like the game is solely about building big armies )
- Missile units are much more effective than in other total wars ( some are a little overpowered if used right )
Cons:
- Expensive DLC that doesn't add much
- Not many units for some nations
- Rebellions occur frequently if not handled properly
- Hard to make money if you don't know how to 
- Armies are significantly more expensive to sustain and use
- If you are a non-Roman nation and take over a Roman city the conversion cost of the central building is ridiculously expensive if you are in an early stage in the game and takes quite a while to finish which within the time a rebellion will likely occur 
- Unit armour and colors aren't very realistic ( Roman armor isn't very time realistic and Nordic uniforms are very bright when they should be darker )
Notes: 
   Definitely wouldn't recommend for newer total war players dont buy this as your first total war but if you have expierence with them than the game can be fun. Almost everything is more expensive which presents more of an economic challenge and if you are waging war on Rome be prepared for lots and lots of rebellions. Bigger map adds some fun if you are a Horde and if you feel like destroying all of europe you can become a horde and raze every city you come to. ( Very Very fun to do with a strong nation ) Overall the game isn't finished and needs polishing but I feel that the good people at creative assembly and the amazing modding community that the total war series has, can truly make this an extremly fun game when it is all said and done.",1425779383,1425779528,True,1,1,0.495774656534194946,0,True,False,False,76561198057432531,378,2,4146,0,1573,1551264394,,
28,14773450,english,"A short playtime feedback. The huns and the nomadic era have a historical thing for me and the representation of this period is pretty impressive. Dark armor tones, flameable objects, the more dominant role of cavalry on the battlefield, wandering hordes and others events make me experience true barbarism while playing as Rome is one of the most challenging Total War experience ever. The strategical map has improved a lot since Rome II, new features and YES family trees are getting you closer to your characters and you can have more influence on their fates. However the tactical part is still struggling with the same issues. Siege defence is a joke on any difficulty because sometimes the AI attacks in waves for no reason (and we got snipers in the towers) and pathfinding of soldiers is sometimes ridiculous. A great little thing for me is that we got civilians in the cites under siege!!! And also we can set them on fire with catapults and they grab swords against invading soldeirs. 

Ultimately I recommend this game. CA has done great, I personally loved Rome II and played around 400 h and this game is far more polished.

29,14784091,english,"Graphically and statically pleasing
Positive:
Creative Assembly has done a great job with the new title in the Total War series. First of all the graphics in this game is absolutely fantastic; great detail in the terrain, weather graphics has never been better and of course the battle graphics. 
     The gameplay is also fantastic; a great balance between each factions units and their functionality. I often found myself choosing “poor” units instead of just taking “the best of the best”. Also with this new title some of the “older” functionalities from other Total War games has been added such as the family/politics menu. All around the game there have been added more features without making it overwhelming, when you attacked enemies’ cities you now have many actions to choose from. Often I found myself realizing that all of the actions where relevant. Speaking of enemies, the AI have gotten a big upgrade. In Attila the AI is dynamic and almost humanly, the AI changes strats every match even in the middle of the battle. Also factions have their own unique style of war. 
Ideas and extra thoughts:
All though the game is great there are some things that I found a bit odd or disappointing. For example the spies and heroes are now unlocked through physical buildings which is a bit disturbing when you have to remove one of the already important buildings. Another thing which I noticed was that in every campaign the same things happened, and I know that it’s historical but sometimes it would be nice with some dynamics in the campaign. After the first campaign I found myself going to other locations because I knew what maybe would come. But these things I think are a minor complain in comparison to the positive things. So let’s go back to the good stuff. 
Conclusion:
     When you combine the beautiful graphics with the great gameplay you end up with one of the best strategy games made. Over all the game is great and I love it. This is a game where you sit down and don’t stop before someone or something stops you from playing it. The Total War felling really shines through and you can almost feel how much effort that have been put into this fantastic title. 
Go BUY it!!

Pros: Graphics are very nice and when the game actually works the game is beautiful, though I am not convinced it's as atmospheric as Shogun 2 during a battle. 

Cons: I am a big multiplayer person (1600hrs in Shogun 2) and the multiplayer in Attila is slow and boring. Rear cav charges do almost nothing and I have replays of cav charges on standing still cav that kill nothing on the charge. The Co-OP campaign is terribly bugged, there are constant desyncs and the game constantly aborts. My co op friend and I literally did everything to try and resolve the problem but nothing works. Bottom line: another 60 dollars...45 dollars base game and 15 dollars for DLC wasted!!!!

Overall: The game suffers from constant bugs for a supposed ""finished"" game. Hell, there are alphas out there that are more polished than this game.

I have been a fan of this series since the Original Shogun Total war. This company no longer cares about the game or the consumer, they make games, and then pile on DLC for money and that is all it is now. What were there like 12 DLCs for Rome 2? Some of which had units that were SPECIFICALLY SAID and SHOWN to be in the game before it was released.  Paying for the blood setting that used to be included in the game? Paying for extra factions that should have been in the game. No more. I will never buy another total war game again. I advise free torrents for any game made by this company until they release a full, working game with features that are supposed to be in the game. Creative Assembly can choke on a D. Greedy cunts.

To their rage I woiuld say this, what right do we have to judge them? We have no idea on wether or not the factions made in DLC where part of the game from the start or not. As for the day one DLC, well, I'm not a fan of the strategy, but I understand it, and its not like you can't be competitive without that DLC, you just don't have quite as much diversity. 
The AI, oh CA, will they ever perfect it? Hopefully, did they this time? No. Is it improved though? Yes, the AI understand the fundementals of strategy, grand and on a battlefield, and it can succesfully pathfind through cities.

And don't get me started on those unit cards! In Attila the UI has been downaized, streamlined, andmade to take up as little space as possible while still giving you an adequite amount of information. From the unit info pop -up to the unit cards, everything gives you important general, and specific information.
 Origional Concept: So you know those pesky pathfinding problems and bare bones derectional orders? Well no more! Custom pathways have been made, by holding shift+RMB you can draw a custom path, this is essential for people using cavalrly, and really lets you set up a battle and have multiple things happening at once. 
I want it back!: Chat, chat, chat. I have always disliked the new chat system of Rome2, and they didn't change it. While not a game breaker, communication is important, I remembver in Napoleon how I would have great conversationjs with people, ranging from tactics, to how long it would take a chicken to fly accross the world! In Attila you don't get that, nor can you easily acces the Team chat function, wich used to be a clickable tab, that wwas very easy and simple to understand. I want it back CA, please, for me? ;_;
So yes, do buy this gae, only $45 USD, definitly worth it if you enjoy the time period, as with all of the TW games. And please, don't hate the game due to your bitterness over Rome2, the games are seperate, and deserved to be judged as such.

67,14762631,english,"I've put over 170 hours into Atilla and over 1000 in Rome 2. Here is how I feel. I will recommend this game, simply because the launch of it and the involvement of the community on an overall basis has made playing this game much more barable when I have to deal with the dilemma of buying DLCs that EVERYONE agrees should have been in the vanilla game. Now, having said that, I can also understand the prespective of where CA and Sega are coming from. You're struggling to survive in an extremely competitive, demanding, and ever evolving industry. So Sega's apparent plan is to follow the ""Micro-pay"" and ""freemium"" style of (mobile)game marketing. If you don't know what that is that is where a company spends less money to create an almost fun game and sells you little tid bits of items, in-game money, etc. to make the game feel more complete while all-in-all you aren't ever actually acheiving anything or getting true satisfaction from the game. So you either stop playing or keep playing and keep waiting for more items to buy. The reason they do this is because they realize with dedicated fans and a certain percentage of addicts, they will happily pay for extra content that we all know should have been in the game to begin with. Do I agree with this method? No I do not. But do I understand where CA and Sega are coming from? Of course I do. They have to make money and profit or else we are stuck playing pong for the rest of our lives. I just wish that in the VERY near future they(CA and Sega) will realize that the way they are marketing the game will ultimately be their downfall concerning this series, and possibly their reputation overall, if they continue to conive their way into our wallets with out ever giving us a blowee.

69,14762274,english,"I bought this game because the initial reviews were SO positive. I was super hyped to get it and actually had to struggle with Steam Support for one week due to my payment method screwing up. When I was finally able to play I was totally stoked. I didn't buy Rome II due to people complaining about it being unfinished and an unworthy sequel. When Attila was released, many reviews said it might not be worth the full price because it is very similar to Rome II, but it being the improved, more fluent version with a different setting. Since I didn't buy Rome II, I felt like I was on the good side buying this. 

Well... Apart from the game being too slow, needing a lot of turns to achieve something (especially economically), the  campaign AI is what makes my stomach turn and my heart hurt. I loved Medieval II and the AI was obviously far from perfect, but this? This is a disaster!
Enemies that declare war on you don't show up in any way sometimes - leaving you stocking up your defences for no reason. Then again friendly states or trade partners trespass your borders without any notice, although the human player is so neatly informed that such an action might have diplomatic consequences. In this way, military access is basically worth nothing. Then, when they do not have a clear destination for some reason, they either end up marching to and fro on the campaign map until the cycle is broken through some outside force. If that's not what's happening, get used to the army doing the same sh*t for forever. When they do not move around, they simply raid any region they find themselves in; it is literally just as normal as trespassing without notice! No matter whether you are friend or foe, the right to raid seems impeccable. So get used to your allies or even vassals to raid your ass and cause economic and civic demise.
The other side to this is that enemies that DO actually invade you get stuck in that same action for years, leaving a fully stacked army for minimal effect. 

What's more is that the coding for sea travel or landing on shore is completely messed up as well. I had two enemy factions from the British isle trying to invade me with two fully stacked armies each, both lead by their high king -  too bad their admirals were too intellectually challenged to get to a coast line where the army can actually leave the ships. And that did not end, they remained on sea until I was done playing this alpha version of a game. 
Moreover, despite the fact that I love factions to be able to become a horde, abandon home and seek shelter in far away, possibly more fertile lands, everything described above concerning army movement on the campaign map also applies for hordes. 

And yet, a special place in hell be reserved for the people making the AI raze EVERY F♥CKING SETTLEMENT THEY CONQUER. Literally, I have not seen more than maybe five times that a nearby enemy would actually take over a city. They either sack it, meaning looting goods and getting immediate pay off for their victory, which is the best thing for you to happen since you can keep the settlement and simply repair damaged buildings; or they turn to their favorite habit of razing and thus destroying everything you have raised and invested in in so many weary turns. After a while, you will find that half of all the settlements were razed, leaving them desolate, which in turn requires a ridiculously high amount of money to re-establish - not to mention all the money needed for more advanced buildings. Thus, re-settling in a desolate region is actually incredibly unrewarding and strategically silly.

I hope I could give you an idea as to how it feels playing this game right now. These are just the major flaws that drove me really mad, not mentioning the missing diversity between factions' units, buildings or simply their representatives (Western Roman Empire, Gauls, Brits, Roman and Western Roman Separatists have equally looking leaders; same goes for Eastern Roman Empire, Macedonia, Eastern Roman Separatists, Judea and possibly more, only played one campaign)...",1425665883,1425666299,False,42,5,0.566030621528625488,2,True,False,False,76561198020454289,37,1,1517,0,1517,1425608988,,

2) I can run a lot of tactics to conquer enemy territories, no problem!
3) I can play the family tree politics for more authorities, no problem!

BUT..
WHY ON EARTH YOU ARE TRYING TO TORTURE ME WITH OVERPOWERED CORRUPTION?
-I have 90 territories and the corruption is nearly 90% and I'm not even set foot on Middle East, Eastern Europe, Asia Minor, etc. I can imagine what will happen to my coffer if I conquered another 10 territories. IF you don't want us to conquer all the places, then please say so! 

CAN YOU PLEASE REBALANCE THE PUBLIC ORDER PENALTIES OF SOME BUILDING?
-when a city is been fully upgraded, it has +5 or +6 for public order, while a town factory is -10 when fully upgraded. looks like CA is telling us that:
""HORDES AND CORRUPTION ARE NOT ENOUGH FOR YOU, THAT'S WHY I GIVE YOU REBELLION <3"" 
LOVE FROM CA

EVERYTHING IS SOOOOO EXPENSIVE! I'M NOT A MONEY-PRINTER YOU KNOW!
-colonize a town: 9000 gold, upgrade a city from tier 2 to tier 3: 6000 gold, etc. HEY CA my bro! my income is about 4000 gold per turn! dont forget of your OP corruption too! EVEN TECHS NEED 25OOO GOLD IN THE END!
-1 of the best part is: churches and water systems are putting salt on my hemorrhargic wounds by sucking more gold from me. WELL DONE CA! YOU ARE SQUEEZING ME HARD!

94,14748744,english,"Hi, I haven't played this game for very long as it has only been released a couple of weeks ago but I figured that this is the point where so many people are relying on reviews to decide whether to get this game so lets dive right in. First of all I need to point out that this game is basically Rome 2 but a bit later on down the timeline. The Roman Empire is past its greatest and has now split into two empires. The GUI (graphical user interface - basically the menus and buttons that you click on) are almost the same. There are a few new/ modified menus but a lot of menus use EXACTLY the same GUI! The idea that you have a provincal capitol and lots of little settlements around it (used in Rome 2) is used in Attila. Personally I don't like this because it is hard to defend a settlement that doesn't have the option to build walls. You can only recruit units with a general (used in Rome 2) also remains - This is completely unrealistic. These are all big problems but there are little problems too most of which I haven't seen yet such as not being able to change the capitol.

Please comment to say if you agree with this but I personally think that the Shogun 2 and Shogun 2 Fall of the Samurai are both better games than this and were made years ago.

If you haven't already bought Rome 2 then this game is a fairly decent game to buy because it has that edge on Rome 2 however that edge is so slight that it is NOT WORTH buying this game if you have Rome 2 already.

9,14740598,english,"First thing, I have only been playing the total war franchise since Rome2 and cannot comment anything prior to that.  With that out of the way, I do recommend this game.  When everything was all worked out I really enjoyed ROME 2.  I bought a couple of DLC for it when it was on sale, had a really fun time playing it.  As for Attila, I knew it was going to look a lot like ROME 2.  I waited till people played it on YouTube, saw what I was getting into, and purchased it.  I really enjoy the added features such as the family tree.  The AI is pretty good to the fact that sometimes it does make mistakes when reacting to me, but in a real battle human make mistakes and if an AI was perfect every time it would be a pretty impossible game to enjoy.  
As for people complaining about this game I do not know why people bothered to purchase the game without doing a little inspection of the game beforehand.  Is it using the same map from ROME 2? yes.  Is the DLC mostly a money grab, sadly that’s the world we live in.  I don’t particularly like it, but there it is.  Wait until all the DLC’s are out and on sell.  If you like ROME 2, you’ll like this game.  And trust me when I say this, it’s A LOT like ROME2.  If you get upset over money grab DLC’s maybe you’ll want to skip it.

10,14521159,english,"UPDATED REVIEW FROM TOTAL WAR FAN PLAYED EVERY TOTAL WAR 4k hours in totalwar 

Anything less then legendary is easy way to fukin easy… but legendary Is just stupid this time around.
Cons
-No workshop until their done milking.
-few factions- (expect 60+ $ atleast in dlc for just shit copy paste factions.. 2 dlc in the first week of release lol)
-Limmited Diversity- hardly anything to recruit in factions (some seem like copies iv seen way better workshop factions from rome 2).
-Battle Ai Builds seige but doesnt know how to use it.
-CAMPAIGN AI- is the worst and super annoying (they will raid and run over and over maybe 1 out of 15 attackers will actually capture factions hardly change on the map except for rising rebels and razed settlements. Raiding will destroy your economy even if it is a pointless settlement it will criple ur game)
-Reblions- public approval is the worst its ever been killing rebelions will do nothing for approval, and they will rise next turn again. making it impossible to leave ur base.
-Turns are long ai hardly expands.
-Should be called total war: horse archer horde Because thats all they build. This kills open feild battles even when u have horses they will kite the fuk out of your army.

Pros
-Ui is much better and makes it hard to go back to other total wars because it is done so well.(very good family tree)
-Razing is fun and does change the map/gameplay.
-Migrations are fun running razing and camping bring fresh breath into totalwar.
-Faction leaders with way better skill trees and custom skins 
-battle and campaign map LOAD MUCH FASTER.(tunrs are still long as shit)

I have played every total war since i was a child(i have bought/played every single one with full dlc) my favorite being shogun 2/ and medival first one, and empires was also great.

TEAMS AND ROSTERS
3/5

 There are very few teams (for the money) even with the vikinings The majority of the teams are copies of eachother and differ by maybe 1 or 2 units. example The viking forefathers have about 2 different units then the barbarian raiders and thats just in name.
 rome/sansannids/huns have the biggest unit rosters, but they are not at all impressive. Want to be Britains tribes? Like in rome 2 where they had a shit ton of units? Ya you can’t be them, and all their units are roman units… they forgot to copy and paste the code im sure it will be a (7.99)dlc

AI CAMPAIGN
3/5
 
Nothing new here. Rasing settlements is the only thing that seems to be somewhat satisfying and its because of the AI.The ai is more annoying then ever. They never once took a city after 5 hours(only rebelions would AND your cities will rebel more then any previous total war before it. During the game the AI will spam units faster then you ever could (this is on hard to legendary difficulty) and the ai will declare war on you for litterly no reason (some times 4 of them at a time but this is also like almost all the total wars on hard to legendary difficulty). 
Here is the new, the AI will spend the entire time just raiding your bases and then running away and coming back. If you dont chase them down, they will repeat this over and over which can get very frustrating chasing them for 10-20 turns. So instead of chasing them you end up razing your own towns just to be rid of the annoyance of the annoying ai. Also now teams do not die when u take their provinces they run into a secluded area and mass a horde until u kill them THIS IS ALSO VERY ANNOYING the rebelions will do this to they will sit out side your base and mass and mass and when u go to kill them they will runaway always being just out of reach.
 
AI BATTLE
3/5

The ai is SLIGHTLY and if not at all better during battles they do BUILD seige equiptment (atlast!) but are incappable of using it example: AFTER 11 turns of me being seiged they finally attacked out numbering me 4-1 mind u and still took 11 turns to attack.(i was, of course, excited to defend against such a force) My gates at the start of the battle were already broken for reasons unknown(probably an agent) yet they used ladders to get on the walls and the rest of their seige equipment stood still, they then abandoned the equipment and slammed as many forces through the gate as possible(this is after the gate was already broken, and they felt the need to take 10 minutes to get the ladders up)  During non seige battles its the same except they use much more horse range lots of catapults.

UI

3/5

The ui has been changed and is much better then rome 2. The unit pictures are 3d representations of the units. They do have alot more notifications the hud is full of everything you will ever need to know which is great also the family tree is wonderfull.

Fraction leaders

4/5

The leaders are great they have 3 item slots( u dont pick up items they just randomly happen, and they do not change the look of you leader). Finally the skills arent just absolutely terrible like in rome 2. Great little skill tree. With that said it doesnt, even compare with shogun 2 hero trees.


Polotics

3/5

With the new ui political monitoring is easier and more neat. Just like in rome 2 you will have random events example: there is an earthquake should speal blood? Sacrifice a bull? Or ask a priestess? just like in the first one even if u choose right the affect is minor. And you will get annoyed of the spam of people trying to marrior your daughter and if you deny them they take away 20 gratitas(in rome it was adoption and took money to stop thank god that is somewhat over with happens very rarely now) and if u let them u get closer to civil war. It is exactly like rome 2 kind of meaningless. Diplomacy is the same to nothing new depending on the difficulty level of the campaign diplomacy will either be way to easy or impossible. On legendary as soon as one fraction declares war they all do again this is the same as most total wars.

Final thoughts

3/5

This expansion is not worth 45$ unless u truely love total war Hence why i bought it. If you are looking for some great fractions and new content u will be somewhat dissapointed. This game feels forced like they ran out of ideas and instead of making something new they decided to mod rome 2 and pretend it was a new game with fancy UI changes. Die heart fans will get a bittersweet taste.(bitter because of the half ass job done and sweet because of the for love total war.) For those of you looking for game changers, this is not one despite the new optition to horde which is ok but does not have a lasting quality about it.This is my first total war i give thumbs down. If you were trying to decide on wether to buy this right now i would wait tell its on sell would be a decent game at 29.99 and i bet you there will be over 100$ of dlc do to the lack of content. Rome total war 2 imperitus is better, and i would stick to that for now. If you didnt like rome 2, u will not like this. You also dont get the great feeling playing any of the fractions yes being atila is fun but fighting the dieing roman empire just isnt as glorious as when i played rome 2 when it got the imperitus update and you could play as Julius and turn the republic into and empire. Just the thought of my being julius/or any of them and conquering titans like Crassus Sepius, and pompei had refreshed the game by itself. But being the nomadic huns gives and fighting an empire thats split and been in decline for awhile gives no feelings of glory the team just isnt that well put together and rome is in decline (as you can tell by their roster) and is the worst team to play due to massive rebelions and nomadic tried running through ur base razing/raiding and running.

11,14739836,english,"For as the game stands from the previous update I do recommend this game. The factions are awesome although the migratory factions and the barbarian factions have similar units starting out but as you progress you get better units that stand a part from the other factions. Surviving seems to be the main objective especially as a migratory faction because some right off the bat are at war with the eastern and western roman empire and the huns, playing as the barbarian factions the saxons or the franks is fun as well although as the saxons you are a bit land locked starting out. The two roman empires are not to much of a threat but it is a good idea to keep an eye on them, the Huns are a faction that is best to avoid at all cost until you at least have two fully maxed armies.  The family tree is back a feature I was jubilant to see because the family tree actually makes me care more for my faction.

The only thing I dislike is that to expand the amount of factions you can play as is you have to buy faction DLC for the price of $7.99 which in my opinion is BS!!!!

But that aside. Total War: ATTILA of it self is a very good game. i really love the family tree where you can perform all sorts of political intrigue. There are also varies stories you have to deal with, like that you son has done something wrong and all the tribal chiefs look to you to deliver the punishment. so you can decide whether to punish him to set an example to others or do nothing to him. and all your decisions have consequences like having controle over you people or losing it.

The battles are just astonishing. It's like i said more clearer than rome 2 giving you a better review over were to strike next with your troops, plus the graphics are also quite nice

It works since the patch. Absolutely great game. But wait until it's on sale in summer. most of the DLC will be out by then and you can probaby grab it all for less than £5.

Original:
Die hard fan. I own an original copy of shogun 1. Wait a year. like rome II, like empire, like shogun 2, 
It breaks my heart to see such hard work being ruined like this. They clearly tried and are working to a sega-designated deadline. 
Crashes, screen freezes. poorly optimized - on low settings I get 14fps with I7 3820, Hd7990 [same as Nvidia's Titan ] 16gb of ram. 

What they've done though, is very definitely an improvement. They do listen to their fan base. In a year this will be a worthy release.

Edit 17/02/15:
Not recommending is not the same as slagging off.
These are just my observations.
- Optimization. It's the shader version. Rome II was plagued by this and took at least 6 updates to fix. It flutters. This is solved by changing one option in the graphics menu. The reload solves it. I end turn and the flutter comes back. 

---
I feel sorry for CA for getting so much hate on forums for features they actually put in. 

For rome I saw moaning about; 2 on 1 not being a feature, shields not being important, units not having mass - All of which were in the DB files. Simply not displayed on the UI. You could have 7 on 1 fighitng if you modded it.

Now it's laid out to see in the UI.

I'm not recommending simply because it's got bugs that need to be fixed. I wouldn't tell someone to buy a car that needs a brake disc replacement.

28,14660164,english,"Would've been a great game if not for the two things: 
1. All this should've been in Rome 2
2. CA trying to squeese every little penny outta the players by cutting the content from the game (aka Forefathers and Longbeard DLC) and *providing* it for extra money. Really, assholes, is 1k rubles not enought for you so u charge another 40% (0.4k total) for 6 factions on the RELEASE DAY? WTF?

PS
After playing this game for a while i found that the AI is really foolish and to compensate that, it cheats. First off, some factions (Eatern Roman Separatist in one of my campaings) has too many armies with hight quality units (Separatist got 3 full stacks while having only TWO cities, i got the same amount of troops, 0 income and  3 full regions of 3k+ income, and 2 cities in different regions), and if AI loose em, he replenish em super fast in 2-3 turns (had to demolish 3 waves of fuckers to get to em from my borders to their cities). 
The declaracion of war by AI is pretty ridiculous too, in multiplayer i played as visigoth and my parter as alans. I settle in Greece, my associate lost one of his two armies by some remote AI. Partner rushes to my lands for defence, and the AI stood on my borders for a while. Moreover, one of his enemies from the start, located in the far right of the map goes across HALF OF THE MAP with one army for my friend, and i kill im for crossing my borders. Now for the juicy part: while all of this happened, one of my armies was sacking roman cities in th asia region, freeing Asia and Pontus. And after i defeated strangles on my lands, Asia, my military ally, DECLARES WAR ON MY PARTER, ALSO MY MILITARY ALLY!. Naturally, i kill him, but he manages to kill my friend's main army and left him with newly recruted one with a couple of units. But there's more! When my friend settles near me, my SECOND military ally, Pontus, also declares war on my partner and kills him in 2 turn. 

On the good side, the land battles became more fun, in Rome 2 u just spawned 4-6 units of artillery and a strong melee units to defend em, shooters sucked as hell, as well as any horsemen beside heavy ones. Now, the arty is significantly weaker, but the shooters and horsemen became more powerfull, wich allows for more tactical choices. I like how u can troll oponnent with hunn horse archers, or how u can shoot an entire squad of shieldmen with 2-3 volleys by positioning shooters behind enemy lines. AI still suck balls thought.

Oh, and dont forget about perfomance. It horrible. My hight-end pc is choking trying to calculate AI turns, framerate drops for about 5 for the duration of the AI turn, wich takes about of 2 minutes.

My own experience has been disastrous. Attila crashes the entire iMac (requiring a push of the power button) during all battle sequences, even on the lowest graphical setting. This is despite my computer being well over the recommended specifications (I have an iMac 5K Retina with 32GB RAM, AMD Radeon M295X 4GB and a i7 4Ghz processor).

This led me to the support forums of the developer where numerous Mac users complain of crashes (similar to mine on iMac 5k), generally bad performance (when it works at all) and unresponsive keyboard.

The developer is not answering support requests on the forum, giving vague canned answers about being ""sorry for the inconvenience"". I've also contacted the publisher, Sega, who have been equalyy unhelpful (communication has just stopped).

I tried running the game in Bootcamp, under Windows to see if it were playable. Same crashing errors encountered on every battle. I then made a trip to the Windows forum where I noticed that a lot of people with Radeon video cards were having similar issues, under Windows.

The major issue I am having with Attila is the performance, at least up to this point (I only have a few hours of playtime so far). The framerates are much lower for me.

On normal difficulty all other faction have some strange ability to create much stronger units than you.  It is like they start off with an advantage which makes this game extremely frustrating.  Additionally as others have complained many times a faction will park in your terrirtory and raid and you spend turn after turn chasing them off and waiting for them to come back and park their extremely strong army on your terrirtory.  Not realistic to retreat an army and march it back.  A valid tactic I suppose but unrealistic.  CA you really need to put the player and AI on the same level playing field and let the best one win.

86,14700787,english,"I have played all of the Total War games, having essentially grown up with them 11 years ago I remember my dad handing a 8 year old me a copy of Rome: Total War and the sheer joy of that first play through. Total War: Attila brings me right back to that feeling.
This is Total War, but with enough improvements and changes that it is truly exciting to play.

The campaign map is absolutely huge, and the way they've divided up the regions seems fairly reasonable, in fact as you see different factions expand, you notice they form much more ""natural"" shaped kingdoms, as opposed to the huge regions we've seen previously.

That nicely leads onto my next point: the AI is clever. Like really, really clever. The diplomacy works great, even the faction I'm friendliest with wont enter into a trade agreement with me because they've got diamonds to trade and I've got logs. The Scots just razed one of my cities and are now avoiding fighting me, as they know without that city, I can't afford to fight them - they're waiting for me to destroy myself. On the battle map, the AI flanks very effectively and seems to be really putting up a challenge (my only negative on this is that they seem to always unnaturally focus on taking out my general, which is a battle ending drop in moral - not sure how realistic it'd be to focus entirely on killing one man in a battle with 2 or 3 thousand people on the field).

The internal politics works pretty well, certainly the best of any Total War game so far - basically you give them little jobs to do and they gain experience for it which in turn gives you perks in the battles/governing. My only gripe on this one is that the Prologue completely glosses over this, and with it being a very new feature, I'd have liked a bit more explaination. I have one general whose loyalty is waining and it keeps telling me to do something about it, but I really can't figure out what I can do as for some reason he wont work any of the jobs.

Graphics wise, I'm playing it at about half way along the scale - on the battle field from a distance it's quite poor, probably origninal Rome levels, but close up it's pretty damn nice. On the campaign map it's really good looking!

Another couple things is the first notification of each turn *always* comes up twice, and there seems to be an incredible ammount of razing cities going on, literally half the cities are burnt to the ground. I'm not sure how realistic that is? Another thing that annoys me slightly is that you can't continue on from the prologue, even though it's set on the full campaign map - it's quite long, so it would have been nice to have seen that continue.

Overall, I'd say this is an absolutely brilliant game. I expect most of my (minor) concerns to be ironed out in the next patch, but they aren't really anything serious at all.

87,14700629,english,"This game failed to meet my expectations.

To me, it is exactly the same game as Rome 2, with the exception of details than in my mind, dont really affect the gameplay at all.

The new mechanics are way overworked and ruin gameplay, like razing and the horde mode. Roaming tribes will raze settlements everywhere, effectively destroying half of the entire map, making it a pain to try and expand.

The AI on the camaign map is worse than ever. As the Vandals, I raided a settlement owned by the franks. So two fully stacked Frankish armies pursued me all the way through my migration into North Africa(Which took 20 years), leaving their home settlement in Germany undefended.

It seems that the whole game is centered around Attila and the Huns. But they never do anything in the campaign because by the time Attila is born or the Huns arrive in Western europe, the whole campaign map has benn razed to the ground.

Overall, I am mostly dissapointed in that this game is like a copy and pasted Rome 2. Or more over some kind of Rome Total War: Barbarian Invaison Anniversary Edition. Hardly anythin is new or original. The only advantage is that it isnt as buggy as Rome 2. Its like a paying 45$ for software to clean the bugs from Rome 2.

For instances all Germanic factions basically have they same units; all Nordic factions have basically the same units etc..Occasionally 1 different unit for big factions; they all look the exact same.. Which is very similar to what they did Rome 2, I know they did something similar to Rome 1, however there wasn't a 100+ factions like in the newer games. I'm not a history expert; I have some basic knowledge but can surly say that army wise and culture wise there would be far most differences. Generals all looks very similar as well which is rather sad. I have always loved the Total war series, it still is amazing game but to pay full price for a game that is lacking in tons of units and then to add dlc to get a few more units to slightly change factions just feels like a slap on the face..Also anyone else noticed they used the exact same voice files as Rome 2.. This game should not be this price for what we get in return..

•  First off, the incessant greediness is getting out of hand, you all know what I mean *cough* 2 DLC's after a single week of release *cough*.

•  Secondly, although I really liked the razing system and all, I finally came to the point to heavily dislike it since a plethora of tribes/factions are literally overdoing it which had as a result half of Europe to be eradicated after 70-80 turns which is ridiculous; I sure get the 'Scourge of the God' thingy and stuff but that's a bit too much. 

•  Again, despite the fact that I think that it has a larger unit variety than it's predecessor I really hoped that they could make certain factions a bit more unique, to my dissapointment they did not. Which I guess is made on purpose for the sake of DLC's.

•  Furthermore, a huge let down in Attila is nothing more than the diplomacy. I honestly had gotten my hopes up for a polished and perhaps a more realistic diplomacy with even more strategic options and what not, nevertheless I was quickly displeased with what I saw.  

•  Lastly, I strongly believe that one(at least) or two new animations should have been added in battles as in its current state the battlefield reminds me a lot of Rome II; Perhaps I'm asking for too much, but hey isn't it a brand new game after all? Why it somehow looks incredibly contiguous to Rome II? That's something that kinda irritates me.

Currently, I really am enjoying the game as well as any TW game that I've played(Started with TW Alexander fyi) though I am neither willing nor able to recommend it at this very moment; I'd say that it's going to need several updates first.

4,14688058,english,"Alright, after 60+ hours of gameplay in Total War: Attila I am ready to give my thoughts on the game and whether to recommend it or not. 

To answer the question is it better than Rome II? Yes it is. The game has the return of family trees and these feel immediately better than the empty faction olitics of the previous game. They also grant some kind of characterization. The political actions cost influence which is gained from governance or as a General. You also have many other things to keep an eye on such as your Dominion meter, Power meter, and control dictate  lot of the faction politics and can be crazy to maintain. Especially as Western Rome. The poliics in the world itself is rather basic and easier to understand but it still does some rather stupid stuff. An example of this I had a puppet state go to war with me for little to no reason because I went to war with another faction. They had no relation ship with them or trade so WTH.. Another is always denying trade agreements and non-aggression pacts when you are neutral with these factions.. it is rather ridiculous. 

This leads me to the AI itself. It is a ruthless one as the killer instinct is here and it is unforgiving if you make a mistake. But the path finding is rather crappy so far but it is an overall improvement but not much of one. The auto resolving is also a bit odd as I had battles when I outnumbered them 2 to 1 and still had a low chance according to the AI which is another reason why I say its not perfect. I had to fight those and show it up and brutally. 

New mechanics in the gameplay is abandoning areas with a scorched earth policy and razing and sacking cities and towns. But the biggest is horde mode in which you are a migrating horde ith camps to maintain and build to grow through sacking and razing. Oh a reminder when you sack a city let us move away from it s they recoup. These factions add a challenge in maintence and if you choose to settle the consequences of this. It is a difficult transition. 

Civil War factions also can create their own faction which is interesting and makes things chaotic. As they were historically. 

Overall I can give a recommend to this title but with a caveat there is still problems with AMD and so on rigs as the optimization is still not that good. Also the DLC is odd given the game is how old? Come on CA.. PATCH YOUR GAME FIRST!!!

*****************************************************************************************8

So i have now played quite a bit of this game, the pros and the cons

Pros,

Its not Rome 2

the teck tree works much better

the food and econemy works much better

the AI seems to be better not great but not a bad as beofore

the generals dont die in 12 turns like before.

the skill trees are much better.

Cons

Razing, you can now destroy settlemnts , this is bad as the AI very rarley recolanises burnt out places. this has left me with half the map desolate. 

Skill trees are not as limited and fun a shogun , they just feel awkword.

Battles graphics has gone arcadie, its cartoony and too quick. this is shockng

there are bugs which stall the game repeatedly. it crashes for a minute or two.

limited factions , hordes dont work well as they dont switch evenly , all horde building which goven you econemy as a hord die when u settle a place. so you could have amazing everything, first settlemet it all goes away, this is poor. skills and traes are stil that why would they disapear. barbarians are over powerd as west rome shatters not even a challenge on very hard.  not enough variance in factions

Bad troop balancing, rome should have good heavy infrantry , and cavalry nearly betetr thn any one elses, barbarians should have nearly as good but cheaper. troops should be better and worse in certain areas and factions, this game is just diffent skins but the troops seem to be the same (plus minus 1-2 points) all through the game. its sad and boring. no specialties i fine no uber units. I cry at the same ness of this game. 

So all in all this is a better ame than rome 2 but romes troops and battles were better after the emporer edition. but the econemy and AI are better in the broadest sense of the term in this version . but still not amazing. I cry at the potential of this game that wasnt realised. 

I would recomend waiting 6-12 months as i wasted £30 preordering this.

15,14680955,english,"*This is not a review about the contents of Total War: ATTILA, this is a review of the current state of the game*

Total War: ATTILA is an improved version of Total War: Rome II. It boasts better gameplay mechanics, a 'smarter' AI, a more immersive campaign, and better graphics. However, the  game still contains quite some bugs, especially when it comes to multiplayer stability. Bugs which were originally included in Rome II (but were fixed later on) suddenly make a reappearance in ATTILA. Examples include: The game crashing after a NPC initiates a battle, sound cutting off, leaving you with nothing but sillence, or desyncs (especially the desyncs).
I've played Rome II for 380 hours, which does not quallify me as a master strategist. However, I did experience the whole 'broken launch', and all the patches afterwards. Rome II has come a long way since its launch, with the final Emperor's Edition being excellently playable. I find it dissapointing to see these long patched bugs reappear in ATTILA. Let's be serious here, a (real time strategy) game shouldn't crash whenever an enemy attacks you.

Gamebreaking or not, let's keep the bugs on the sideline here, and move on to the AI.
In the Total War series the AI is a large, if not crucial part of the game, with the campaign consisting almost entirely out of computer controlled factions. I am aware of the fact that it is nearly impossible to make an AI truly sophisticated, although Shogun II came pretty far, but the AI in ATTILA seems to have lowered the standards even more by its ridiculous obsession over barricades.
Let be support this statement with an example: Whenever you deploy a barricade in a settlement, and the AI comes near it, the AI will go full retard in its attempt to destroy the barricade. This can be incredibly useful, because it gives you some time to reposition your units, but it is NOT (really? not?) what a 'master strategist AI' should do.
The AI still seems to favor suicide charges over camping, which was probably coded to prevent the notorious 'hillcamping' from Shogun II. I will give credits to the campaign AI however, as they really manage to f*ck me up the arse.

The game also has some performance issues, mainly when it comes to the graphics side.
I know, I know, ""this game is designed for future GPU's"", but that doesn't ratify the frame drops when rendering shadows, especially in the campaign map. And why does this game only detect 3 gigabytes of VRAM in my GTX 970?
With the rather mediocre FPS i'm getting on max. quallity (33 FPS on average) I certainly could have made use of that extra gigabyte of memory.

When you remove all these shitty bugs, performance issues or AI incompetence, you are left with an incredibly fun game. I'm certain that Total War: ATTILA is the best of what the Total War series has to offer right now, with lots and lots of refined content. However, I cannot recommend this game for what it is now: a rather broken mess of barricade-chasing morons with popping shadows. I certainly recommend you to buy this game whenever these problems are fixed.

I had high hopes for Rome 2, I enjoyed the game, but eventually I got bored with the repetetive (greektesque) factions and the low level of freedom ""custom"" armies provided. I had hoped for something grander and mindblowing. 

Though I did enjoy the game, it didn't leave me with the same amazement Rome:Total War provided, or the novelty and smooth gameplay that Shogun 2 (where crushing an enemy's army meant that he was more than happy to become your puny vassal).

Attila does feature a lot of great moments; the weird joy you get from razing an obnoxious foe's city to the ground, the awesome migration mechanic that adds novelty and new challenges to the game and finally the more diverse choices in units.

Unfortunately the horde mechanic means that it is difficult to get rid of your enemy, and combined with the horrible diplomatic system means that you can be the most powerful nation in Europe by far, and yet those pesky Swedes who declared war against you on turn one still feel like they can take you head-on!

So why am I recommending this game?

Because it adds novelty, differences in playstyle and most of all because I'm still in love with the franchise; through all it's flaws it is still a unique and grand game (don't get me started on the DLC), and hopefully CA can escape the clutches of SEGA to do what they do best.",1425050855,1425050855,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197990059208,89,7,17036,0,2401,1577583638,,

Some of the big issues these people had with Rome 2.
They hated the UI and especially the unit cards, so CA changed them and they are very cool now.
They disliked the low manouvrability of ships and general buggyness of naval battles, so CA changed them. Boats can now turn extremely unrealistically well making sea battles very smooth and a lot easier.
They complained about transport ships being overpowered, so now you can kill entire transport fleets with a handful of ships.
They complained about Rome 2 graphics being too low and the game being too heavy. Attila runs smoothly on maxed out eveything on my pc but also loads faster on minimum on my brothers old laptop.
They complained about the daughters of mars being unrealistic, a moneygrab and stupid.
So they put female troops alongside male troops in germanic armies which is realistic, cool, well implemented and free.

They changed a lot, mostly for the better making the game smoother and easier than rome 2 while having less AI mechanics to abuse.
I'm not a real high graphic games kind of person but to me the game looks pretty neat.
Weather effects are still hell, slowing down framerate and obscuring sight.
The factions are cool, they share some units but have good differences.
There is great potential for extra factions and units so the game is only going to get better.

I personally liked rome 2 a lot, the variety of units it boasted over the shogun roster was glorious and made every coop campaign a treat. I liked shogun 2 for properly introducing coop campaign as a base feature of the game and I still like Emprie rome and Medieval 2 for their scope and depth.

The game is still missing a coop campaign for more than two people, some units are upgraded in tiers kind of like the roman reforms in rome 1 and 2 effectively reducing variety in armies. I personally don't like this feature, but it's not really better or worse than the normal rosters.

40,14635111,english,"This game is good for campaign i guess.

Now, let me introduce you to some of the ridiculous things they HAVE to sort out if multiplayer is going to be balanced.

-Cavalry has to be easier to dis engage from another cav unit (at the moment you have to spam them at least 4 times to withdraw, and then most of them die trying to withdraw). at the moment it basically just means whoever has the better spearmen/inf spam around cav will kill the others cav, there is no enjoyable micro like there was in m2tw.

-Cavalry is too easy to kill when charging
some cav have armour by the way, and they just get destroyed straight up. no risky charges anymore for me.

-Shock cav has little/no use. shock cav charge once. if the enemy is foolish enough to leave a unit of melee inf/archers behind, then great, mow them down. cavalry- you charge them in the side, and they get caught up in a messy brawl and are fucking impossible to disengage, so they just get destroyed. whats the point? there is almost none.

-Tagmata cav needs to be nerfed immediately, ERE are horrendously overpowered, huns are underpowered and various units such as thracian oathsworns and chosen units are overpowered when used well.

-Archers are terrible, they need to have a huge buff. shooting 20 units of germanic elite archers at one unit of roman armoured inf (hercules something) in testudo. used all ammo, thats going to be a lot of arrows, guess how many kills? NONE. yes historically archers wouldnt have done much damage but there are holes in sheild walls, not every single part of a man is armoured and there are gaps for eyes etc.

-They NEED to buff units like palantina. elite units absolutely wreck the units which are still decent infantry, but cannot match more elite units. like they dont put up a fight. they kill about 4 and rout. noble germanic swordsmen have decent stats, even when upgraded, they get absolutely shredded like a russian in ww2. it is a complete joke. you are forced to use the most elite infantry, once again, ERE will win on that front too.

-The units are too hard to click on in game, i am constantly missing units and its really annoying, the little squares are too small and you cannot drag an area to select all of the time, sometimes it doesnt work.

-One last thing is the game itself. In multiplayer battles there are a lot of glitches, with people getting booted from the lobby for no reason, the game slowing down when someone has a shit internet/computer, it goes to very slow speeds and makes a game unenjoyable. i dont think ive played a siege yet at a proper speed. my game has crashed quite a lot also.

This game has a fun multiplayer, don't get me wrong, but i just cannot see the replayability for it because it is not based on skill, more on army compositions and i fear ERE is going to be very overused.

Buy it for campaign and casual multiplayer, it excels there. serious MP players, go get m2tw, its the best total war there is, this game has nothing on M2TW.",1424792734,1424974255,True,3,0,0.550329267978668213,0,True,False,False,76561198148976906,23,5,2960,0,2407,1444653506,,

So I've dabbled. I'll start by saying I was disappointed in Rome II, and I'm a little upset that ATTILA feels like the 'completed' game, where Rome II felt like a scaffold that was released WAY too early. Rome became bearable only with patches and (in my opinion), some mods. ATTILA: Total War feels like the final product.

It's beautiful, both in the campaign and battle modes, and the interface feels appropriate whereas in Rome it really felt lack-luster. The game handles pretty well, and I am loving the fluidity of unit movements in combat- it's much MUCH smoother than in older engines.

Honestly I've been waiting for Medieval III, and even though it's titled ATTILA, I feel that this is the game I've been waiting for.

This is a GOOD thing. 
Back in the olden days, the only thing that sucked at Total War was the AI. With Total War: Attila, they return to that Golden Age of everything is awesome except that I'm constantly winning. As a Total War veteran, that's still an issue for me, because I want to see a day where AI surprises me with competence on the battlefield (they don't nearly suck as much on the campaign map....well, sometimes), however for the less experienced player, this is actually rather helpful, since you can get away with loosing important battles without having to forfeit your campaign. And, well, you can screw up and still win, which is fun :D 

The thing is though, this is nothing new really. Sure you got the horde mechanic, but that's been done, even if it's execution is quite a bit better than in the past. The factions you can choose from: Western Rome, Eastern Rome, Sassanides (=Persians), Franks, Saxons, 4 Migration factions starting out as a horde (both goths, vandals, and some other faction) and the Huns are not THAT many to choose from but at least they are all more or less interesting. 

Coming to a conclusion, I would have to say that so far I like Attila a lot. Haven't had this much fun with a Total War game since Shogun 2. It got me into a good Total War vibe, not the bad frustrating one that makes you wanna hate on Creative Assembly, but the good vibe that captivates you and sucks you into the game in a way that is both relaxing and rewarding. I missed that. 
Rome 2 isn't as bad now, as it used to be. It also turned out to be a fun game, even if it isn't the best. Attila however is fun NOW and good NOW and instead of becoming enjoyable in a couple of months, it might actually get even better and even more fun in a couple of months.

Will you raze and pillage your way to a new home as a migrating horde? Will you build a new empire on the ruins of the once so magnificent Rome?

Not only is Rome falling and the Huns coming, but the climate is changing. All of the world will feel the effects of the dimming sun and the expanding infertility might force you to relocate before your people starves.

And don't forget to keep your family and aspiring and ambitious statesmen in check.

Sadly, as much as I like this game, it and it's publishers have their faults. Day 1 DLC, Week 2 DLC. Imbalanced unit rosters. As you discover the arts of war and gain access to better units, you can no longer recruit the worse. Instead they are replaced and this leads late game armies being very costly and takes away from the army management as you can't have a cheap infantry line with flanking elites.

Besides the celtic units are already coded in the game, but locked. I'm a bit insulted that I have to buy access to existing features. Here's for hoping that they had to do it because release was rushed and there will be free DLC that adds them to the game.

Nico here from the Creative Assembly community team. 
I am sorry to hear that you have experienced such issues while playing Total War: ATTILA. 

I would suggest that you make sure you are using the latest drivers for your graphics & sound cards and that all files have been installed properly. If the game hasn’t been installed properly (i.e. missing or corrupted files during the installation) or if you are using outdated drivers, the game won’t be able to run nor start properly.

To make sure all files have been installed properly, do a right click on the game from the list, click on Properties > Local Files > Verify integrity of game cache...
That process will check the installed files and make sure that everything has been downloaded and installed properly.

If you need assistance to update you graphic and sound drivers, it is best that you contact the manufacturer of your graphics card / sound card directly.

Finally, if you are still experiencing those issues while playing the game, do not hesitate to contact our Support team on our official forum (create a new thread):

+ FAMILY TREE (finally it's back) along with specific actions like marriage, adopt, embezzle etc

+ Improved both campaign & battle AI proving indeed tough on higher dificulties
+ Seperate events for every faction as also different approach on victory conditions
+ Challenging campaign as you have to struggle not only with war, but famine and desease giving severe penalties in case of negative sanitation or empty food stores
+ Beautiful & Detailed graphics both on the campaign and on the battle but also...

- ... strenuous for your PC, optimization patch for Nvidia is out, still waiting AMD (myself)
-  perfomance issues due to the system requirements
-  there isn't any playable faction on britain such as celts or picts.. (DLC?)
-  significant lagging during AI campaign turn especially after 20 turns or so
-  still some game breaking bugs and game crashes every now and then
-  complex politics and the same diplomacy as ROME 2, for some this can be a downside

[h1]8.0/10[/h1]

After the fiasco release of ROME 2 and the bad PR i believe CA had their backs on the wall and their gamble paid off so to speak because the next installment had to deliver both in content and innovations but also in as less bugs/crashes possible and in my opinion they succeded delivering us what ROME 2 should be on the first place but not without minor problems...

I [b]RECOMMEND[/b] Attila since this should have been ROME 2 all along but it comes in a form of an expansion and with it's downside being ""heavy"" on most PCs and as such is playble only on high end PCs consider this before buying, and i will give updates to my review since it's 10 hours in the game  
...in my opinion let's not forget this game takes place at 400AD, Medieval 3 around the corner?!?![/i]",1424192883,1424873896,True,5,0,0.567466855049133301,0,True,False,False,76561198007408736,198,4,30287,0,5218,1589289504,,
75,14645970,english,"As a veteran of all the Total War games to date, I was sceptical about Attila. I wasnt even sure if it was a stand alone or a glorified expansion.

In essence it is Rome 2 Total War. The map is slightly smaller, there are less starting factions, (more to be added as DLC nodoubt).

However it has enough differences, no, improvements, that its definately worthy of your time. 
The map is even more detailed than in Rome 2, although it is still much darker and more brudeing than other total war games, something I like as I think it adds to the feel of the time period, but not to everyones taste.

The Ai is drastically improved over Rome 2 Vanilla, and even over the patched Rome 2. 
The computer players are far more aggressive, opportunistic, and tactical, often catching you out when you leave your city undefended, or a flank unguarded. 
The Siege Ai is vastly improved as are the cities in general. They are much easier to control with your troops actually going where you want them logically, atleast 90% of the time. (Rome 2 it was like 10% of the time).

The horde and roving nations mechanics are excellent and let you play Total War in a completely different way, infact, as TOTAL WAR. Fight after fight after fight, with less economical worries.
Razing, looting and raiding are now a major strategy, allowing you to subsidise or even run your economy off it.
Abilities like, earning more income for ever 10% of a settlements buildings you burn in a battle (yes you can target huts and burn them), is realy cool, and actually makes you feel like you are waging a pyscological war on your enemies.

There seems to be a good selection of units for each faction, with each faction have a good number of unique troops.
Ability to upgrade troops to a new troop type once the tech is unlocked, rather than just unlocking a new unit to buy, is a good feature in my opinion.

The graphics are vastly improved from an already pretty Rome 2. Not that I can run it on overly high, as like all TW games, it can be a power hog. But if you are lucky enough to be able to, you will have some very gorgeous battles.

The family tree is back, with a much more in depth political system and to some extent diplomatic system. Want to kill your son because he is fathering too many welps on his servants not his wife? Sure! Also it actually matters how influencual your family is within you faction, and has more extreme effects. It actually pays to not have 100% influence, as the negative effects from that often out weigh the positive. So balancing it is fun.
It isnt the most stream lined system for politics, but it is TW, we expect this.


Negatives?

I think more factions at the start would be nice. They are well designed, and fun. But releasing more DLC a week after release? Seems a little cheeky, and doing that for Rome 2 annoyed people. However the factions are more unique than they were in Rome 2, so might be better.

It is a power hog.

It isnt that different from Rome 2.

It is a remake of Rome, Barbarian Invasion.

It has a steeper learning curve and enjoyment curve than previous game. Because of its increased difficulty.


Overall. 

I would recommend this game. Its one of the best and most polished TW games to date. Even if it is more of a half-game/expansion.

Just dont expect too many radical changes, but enjoy the things they got right this time!

In fact though, rebalance is probably not the right word. Completely overcompensate the other way is probably the way I would describe it. In the past, castle defenses were pretty useless. Now apparently, when attacking a castle with 1200 men in it, with an army of 2100, I only loose 150 men to the enemy army but another 330 to the 6 garden shed size wooden archer towers which couldn't contain more than 10 men each realistically. 

On top of that the game randomly freezes fairly regularly and looses my progress, the archer towers are also somehow almost fire retardent and one of which took out 200 of my 300 archers while attempting to deliver the last 24% damage needed to destroy it (after empting all my onager ammunition on it) using flaming arrows and it also takes so long to capture that you loose an entire unit on each, and generally yet again, it doesnt really seem like they've added anything, only taken away (aside from the new unit models).  

All in all a pretty poor effort for a company that must have tens if not hundreds of millions of dollars under their belt from these titles, which have, to be fair, all just poorly reproduced what the original game had, but with better graphics and MORE LIMITED GAMEPLAY!!!

What however am I not happy on?

Mainly the fact that they are bit feeding us the factions via DLC, DLC which was developed much earlier along the development path than the release date.

Day 1 Viking Forefathers Culture pack (17th Feb)
Day 7 Longbeards Culture Pack (26th Feb)

So whats next guys? 7 days after that we get drip fed another DLC, each time unlocking more units?

Currently as it stands this is mocking us, paying full price for essentially a fixed Rome 2 and then drip feeding us the factions that are supposed to come with the game?

I can understand campaign packs or new factions which clearly werent made for day 1 release date, but witholding factions and releasing them bit by bit, especially when the factions are already full of copy paste units?

Of course someone in CA listens somewhere finally, otherwise Attila wouldn't be the game we wanted from Rome 2 (still a few bits missing sure but were closer), so we can sit and hope that they value long term gains over short term gains.

I wanted to love this game. The Creative Assembly added just enough to make me want it, just enough to make me forget it's numerous limitations. 

Little things drive me nuts in this game. The artificial space limitations. I can't build a smithy because I need that spot for a well. A well I could just dig next to my new smithy. A pity.

I can only field two armies. Four. Or six. Whatever. I can't arbitrarily promote a man, have half the army stand ten feet away and call it two armies. Apparently Generals are an endangered species. This isn't a problem early on, but eventually you find yourself with thousands of people in dozens of provinces completely unprotected because some invisible metric said you can't promote another general, and soldiers can't march around without one. Yes, I understand there are garrisons, but lets be honest how often have you lost an invasion to a garrison if you planned at all beforehand?

I also became a great power and people hated me. Hated. Even allies of decades. Alliances, marriages, unbroken treaties, trade agreements and friendly borders ruined by arbitrairily becoming a great power. With one province. Yep, Those dastardly Danes and their little island. An ever-increasing diplomatic penalty means you eventually have to fight everyone. Always.

Oh, and never let a general become disloyal and rebel. It starts a cascade of rebellions and civil war that can rip your empire in half. Even from as early as a few turns into the game. You have to use influence to give someone a gift. Or tell them, ""hey, man, nice job being a general, I value your service."" Nope, instant murder-time. ""Et tu, Brute?""

Having such limited technology, so few units and very little difference between them, the endless stream of tribes flowing randomly around the map, burning provinces to the point that half of Europe is empty, and more than a few crash-to-desktop bugs have crushed my enjoyment of this franchise. 

I miss being able to build walls around a settlement. To build a larger number of buildings allowing better variety of troops, and specilization. I'd love some streamlining of family dynamics (unweildy family tree and finding characters), and clearer understanding of who's a subordinate of whom before giving promotions that crush people's morale. 

I still wish for any sort of depth to diplomacy. 

The strategic map, my favorite area (while a huge number of people live for tactic battles, and who can blame them it's the strong-point of the game) is an unmitigated bore. Watch armies wander randomly back and forth for decades, marching ceaselessly to and fro along the same road until their capital is destroyed and they vanish. See hugely developed nations randomly uproot, burn down their homeland and wander until they are destroyed leaving huge swaths of uncontested territory. Often you'll find massive fertile but empty lands. One example being all of what would one day be France and Germany sitting completely desolate in a particular campaign. 

Even with no pressure from marauders or lack of resources, these states just up and move, leaving their ancestral dead in the ground, their homes and farms behind and walk around until extinction. 

I do, however, love the polish in some areas. I can even see what a lot of the goals for the game were, but everything feels done half way (excepting tactical battles, which were exceptionally done.)

I don't want to dump on the game. I paid money for it because I loved its predecessors, and I enjoyed this game, but it feels hollow. It distinctly feels like my last one. Not for glaring reasons, but because it's become a stale cracker, left sitting overnight, that used to be salty and crisp, and has only a damp, limp bland texture left after it's time has passed.

I loved Total War. I did. I'll think of it fondly and tell my friends about Shogun and Medieval and the weeks I poured into them. I will not, however, have grand tales from this franchise in the future. 

I await it's successor, something upstart and brave to come along and renew the Grand Strategy genre.

Tried playing as Jutes first round. Within a couple of turns Brittania declares war and parks a fully equiped, only heavy units army in my area, and does nothing.. just sits there.. this while their homeland is destroyed and conquered, but apparently thats not an incentive to return home. In the meantime you stand no chance because you can only recruit amazingly weak levy units until you research some tech, which takes at least 30 turns until you got some the right ones. You may stand a small chance in a def. siege battle, but like i said the ai does noting but sitting out of range and fortify. So i was stuck/bored and decided to try again.

Second round the Angles declarded war early on and parked TWO bloody armies in my territory.. doing nothing.. just standing there.. doing nothing.. just waving their middlefingers gently in the air. And because you can field and substain only 1 levy army you, again, stand no chance and you're stuck. 

Also migraiting = instant bankruptcy. And for some reason the game randomly freezes when it's my turn.

**edit**

Other things:

- AI spams raze button. In the time that Attila arrived, the whole of europa was a smoldering wastland with only 15% of its regions inhabitat. 
- Even on normal/hard neutral states, Allies and tribute stats from al over the world randomly declare war, even if you have a good relation with them. Example: i played the Eastern Roman Empire and out of the blue the Ebdanians, who i had a trade agreement with, declare war (they're in modern Ireland).

I've established good trade relations with the Franks and Jutes and am having a steady income. My genius Governor takes up an office without my consent but I ignore it, why?. Because King Gewis of the Saxons is patient and influential. The Geats threatened me and went to war, but before they could make a move their agents informed them what's waiting for them should they decide to march across the Saxon lands, so they came crumbling down with their diplomats to negotiate a peace treaty. King Gewis accepted, why?. Because King Gewis is patient and influential.

Year 400 A.D. The treacherous Danes invade King Gewis' keenly kept lands, 4,000 Saxon troops across the region converge in a united defense against the Danes, the battle ensues, it was a bloody battle and Alas! The day was not ours, the battle is lost, King Gewis' subjects advise him to abandon the lands but he denies. Why?, because King Gewis is patient and influential. He writes a letter to his son to raise an army. King Gewis steps out of his domain and marches across his own lands with his personal army of 1,900 Saxon Spears while his son prepares to join him with an additional 600 troops. 

This war is far from over, perhaps the Danish agents didn't inform their masters of what happens when King Gewis comes out of his domain, perhaps they didn't inform their masters that chaos ensues when King Gewis of the Saxons decides to battle.

-The atmosphere is great. It actually feels(to me) like the end of an era, as the empire crumbles apart into shadows. It's like a much more organic and ""real"" version of Rome 1's Barbarian Invasion expansion.

Cons:
-I really don't like CA's faction DLC policy, though at least it's a lot more forgivable this time around to not include the Vikings(who are basically a reskin of the Saxons honestly) than in Rome 2 where you had to pay for nations like Sparta and Athens, which a lot of players will agree was BS.
-Diplomacy is frustrating sometimes. People seem to want to be at war with you forever no matter what, no matter how many times your destroy them
-Occasional freezes, usually when going from one turn to the next... not permanant though, I haven't had a single crash result from any of them.
-The AI likes to spam agents even worse than in R2

A lot was improved over Rome II in terms of RPG elements such as family trees, politcs rework, expanded char options. As well as the AI being more challenging making less mistakes which is also a welcome experience.

Now of course like all major title games released it has its occasional bugs and crashes however I must say unlike last release (Rome II) they are relatively minor and rare in occurance at least so far in my first 89 Hrs of gameplay and like last time I am confident these will be patched away :) 

All and all if you enjoy history and grand stratgey in a sandbox enviornment that makes every game different from the last then this is the game for you! and lets not forget migrating via Hordes(army + city on the go) to new lands! 

to all who do end up giving this game a try Happy Raiding & Migrating!",1424751983,1424752007,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198002763579,221,8,39170,0,6849,1526942437,,
33,14629727,english,"A few good things:
+Most challenging Total War of the Warscape Engine era. Hard feels like legendary in other Total Wars
+Has huge amounts of character and gets the player invested like Shogun 2, unlike Rome 2
+Although there aren't many campaigns, each start and where you go from there are very different from faction to faction
+The campaign AI is much more aggressive than even post ImpEd Rome 2. Enemy invasion is a clear and present danger
+The campaign AI is actually reasonable. As long as they don't hate you, the AI will be willing to trade and even sign non-aggression pacts with you. Finally the AI realizes trade is good for everyone :D
+Politics have been expanded to the point where they are actually somewhat interesting, not a throw away mechanic like in Rome 2
+Character trees are back. Why they were removed in the first place, no one will know :D
+The Huns are pretty damn scary

A few bad things:
-The province system from Rome 2 has been changed little. If you liked its simplicity there, you'll like it here. If not (like myself), you just have to deal with it
-Battle AI hasn't made any improvements since ImpEd Rome 2. It's still quite easy to out maneuver them and crush them in a humiliating fashion
-Although politics have been expanded, there is still room for improvement and expansion, especially in presentation.
-Unit variety is somewhat trite compared to Shogun 2/Rome 2
-I could run Rome 2 on high/very high without trouble. I get some considerable studdering on the same settings in Attila

If you couldn't tell, all my criticisms are nit-picks. Gone are the days of Rome 2's glaring issues, and CA has made a much welcomed return to the older style of Total War. I'd say Total War is something to be excited about again. Let's hope they don't screw up the next one.

9/10 If it wasn't for the somewhat lacking scope of the game as a whole and a few negatives, this could easily be a perfect 10",1424750958,1424750958,True,5,0,0.51359248161315918,0,True,False,False,76561198041711457,262,13,2700,0,1648,1460954434,,

35,14628587,english,"Total War: ATTILA has been a pleasant suprise for me. Though the game is not ""completely new,"" I can't help but say how much fun it is playing this game. Whether you play as the Roman Empire desperetly trying to maintain its large borders, the Norsemen from Sweden, and Denmark, or even the Scourge of God, the huns, the campaign feels amazing to play. The game plays very similar to Total War: Rome II, but then again this was to be expected. A good comparison to this game would be how Napoleon was to Empire. 

      ATTILA's Rankings             

Bugs/Glitches - 9/10   Through my playing of this game, I have not encountered many bugs, and most of them were graphical bugs that should be fixed in a patch or two.

Graphics - 8/10 Though the graphics are very similar to Rome II, ATTILA has a darker and sharper feeling than its predecessor. The only problem with them is that occasionally, I get a random frame drop when I zoom into the action, but if you have a nice computer, you should be able to run this with ease.

Gameplay (Battle) - 7/10 ATTILA has made some progress over Rome II, however the battlefield AI is still not perfect and will sometimes make headscratching decisions. Despite a few flaws, the AI is very playable and a large step up from Rome II.

Campaign - 8/10 For me, ATTILA's campaign rivals such great campaign experiences of Shogun 2 and Empire Total War. I have found that (On Hard Difficulty) the AI makes clever moves and usually presses the advantage when it has an obvious one. A drawback to the experience is that it sometimes feels that a nation will declare war on you for almost no reason at all. The diplomatic system in ATTILA is, however improved. AI now make reasonable demands and will atempt to make peace if they are losing the war badly.

Interface - 10/10 In ATTILA the interface and advisor help have been fantastic. Even though I do not need to use the advisor helpthat much as i am an experienced total war player, it helped me through the new features of the game in detail.

FINAL ATTILA RATING - 8.5/10 The game is beautiful and fun, however i believe that the slight lack of AI inteligence and minor glitches bump it down a notch.

38,14628549,english,"They fixed almost all of Rome's bugs in this game, for I have only encountered one AI bug yet. It is a shame that releasing a complete game is an achievement for a once great company. Furthermore, the root of the problem that lead to Rome's downfall is still here in Attila: greed before quality. This releasing of Day One DLC, followed by the release of a faction pack for eight bucks is criminal. When a game is released it should be released with all elements that are complete at that time. DLC is for content that was incomplete at or developed after its release date. CA, stop this. As a matter of principle, I shall not buy any of these Unit Packs, but only DLC that is honest. The game mechanics are much more refined than Rome. The atmosphere is wonderful even on the potato that I run this game on. There are some minor problems with tactical AI and unit stats, but they are a reasonable amount to have before the first patch. For example, the Defensive Testudo is OP, occassionally units in the Defensive Testudo turn in place, exposing their flank to the enemy, and I have had an AI unit of lancers work their way behind my lines, form up, and then just stand ten yards behind my men instead of charging. The main improvements in this game are in politics and the economy. With this, I have no complaints and only praise. Both are complicated, hard to handle, but fair and reasonable in their operation. In other words, they are just what economic and political mechanics should  be. This is a solid 8/10 game. It is a shame that CA peaked with Shogun II though. I urge CA to return to the Spirit of Shogun, the Spirt of Excellence, and put the game before a quick buck, lest they drive loyal customers like me away.

The politic system is harder to manage, fertility becomes an issue when the lands become infertile as time goes on and the new migration mechanics are also nice, especially for the Huns who can't settle down and thus are constantly migrating. With hordes laying entire provinces to waste and the slow climate change, the campaign also feels more like you're fighting for survival instead of simply getting an empire as big as possible like in Rome 2, making Attilas campaign stand out from those in previous TW games.

in short:

 Pros: 
- Graphics and Effects are Pretty, animation is better. the UI looks better
- Hord mechanics and resettling is interesting/fun
- Better variety of barbarian/horde units out of the box
- Good narrative
- Engaging campaign, objectives, cinematic events.
- UI is easier to use

Cons:
- Glitches, Glitches, and more Glitches, EA has nothing on CA for incomplete releases.... god damn.
- Huns don't feel like the great conquerors that they were historically, always outgunned and very difficult to grow because of their inability to settle cities. and with all the different factions out there they get ganged up on a lot.
- no optional campaign to start off with the traditional small provence and grow your empire from there. (traditional total war mode if you will)
- Day 1 DLC, CA you are disloyal cunts to your customers what the fuck is wrong with CA they always milk the fuck out of DLC. offer a season pass/premium pass that allows you to be done with this bs, like everyone else and include the main historical factions @ least ffs, looks pretty dumb when you add main factions of the era after the fact. and no Day 1 DLC!!!!! at least wait a month, at the very least.

59,14611065,english,"~Written 6 days after the game has come out for future reference~

Positives:
1) The battle AI seems generally improved. They flank with cavalry, go into spaced formation when shot at and have much better pathfinding. Also, they use their abilities more now.
2) Politics has been reworked and now is quite in depth, though is slightly confusing at times. Characters can perform tasks such as looking for a wife or stealing funds.
3) Unit upgrades have been added to all factions instead of just Rome from Rome II. Through tech your weak levy unit can eventually turn into quite decent units.
4) The new siege mechanics of doing fire damage to inflict debuffs or maintaining seige for long enough to open holes in the enemy walls without having to have any seige equipment is useful and interesting, meaning you no linger have to seige them out for the whole 12 turns but can wait 7 and then swarm through the gap that opened up.

Neutral:
1) Morale seems either too powerful or too weak depending on the situation. Units rout very easily now, which on itself isn't bad, but by manipulating it you can really bully the AI. It rarely defends its general, and killing the general now seems to give a HUGE penalty to morale, so much so that I've seen entire stacks rout once their general dies. Helpful when attacking the AI, but it can be silly sometimes when your own army runs away despite still having full numbers because some unit fired a ""whistling arrow"" at you.
2) Razing and sacking is an interesting mechanic which I want to like, and many do and I can see why, but for me it feels kinda pointless. Sacking gives lots of money and is great, but razing barely gives any money and wipes the town from the map, meaning you can't go back and loot it again and overall seems like a waste. Burning your own city to halt the AI or other players also doesn't work or make full sense, as armies don't attrition or take penalties for crossing desolate land, so that town you sacrified to create a buffer can just be walked straight past by hostile armies coming for your remaining places behind it. Plus, the AI is far too eager to raze places for no real reason. Cool mechanic and it has amazingly satisfying graphics when you do, but it just seems strange.
3) Diplomacy is either hit or miss. The Eastern factions are all very friendly towards the Sassanids, but if you play anywhere else the other factions tend to hate you inherently. I suppose this is historically accurate, but your actions in game should shape the other nations opinions of you, not just entirely what has happened before you even began. Allies atleast don't seem to betray you.
4) The addition of all the religions to the game is sweet and I really like it, but they seem mostly similar and the buffs are small. Celtic Paganism seems to be the best religion, but I only found that out by taking a risk and converting; the game doesn't tell you the benefits of each religion, so its a huge gamble unless you know what you're doing. Still, I like the feature, I just wish it was more important and you could see its influence on your soldiers in battle, maybe by having them shout specific lines such as the good old ""BAAL HAMMON BE PRAISED!!!"" if you convert to Minor Religions or ""FOR TOUTATIS!"" if you are a Celtic Pagan, especially as they must still have the audio files from Rome II. Religion specific units would be nice too, so we could see Naked Warriors, Christian Zealots, Beserkers and all other unique religious units.

Negatives:
1) Imperium seems to be locked to tech now, which makes little sense and can ruin your plans. Instead of you becoming more impressive and feared as you get bigger, you get more scary simply be having more techs. This might not sound bad, but when you are a measly village in East Poland who researches Goat Herding and suddenly the world declares you some form of super powered apocalypse it makes little sense. It will increase even if it is only civic tech, and the penalty for rising imperium is huge, so much so that anyone except the Sassanids will quickly find that all their neighbours now refuse to enter diplomacy with them due to the huge debuff to opinion. To stop everyone from hating you, you purposely need to stagnate your tech, meaning your buildings and units will be low tier unless you man up and tech up and face the consequences of learning the dreaded doomdevice know as BASIC SANITATION! THE HORROR!
2) The AI seems to be ruggedly determined this time around. When war is declared, it will generally only end when one of you is dead. I've seen the Parthians off in the very east of the map bullet for 17 turns straight to Belgium to take out a wandering horde that entered loot stance in its land at the start of the game, and thats just once example. It will disregard its home situation and come straight for its opponent. This can often be seen the best with the East Romans, who will neglect their entire empire just to chase some 3 unit horde across Egypt. The effect seems doubled against human players too. I've seen that many players say that as the Huns, who start in Ukraine, all they've had is constant harrassment from the Ostragoths, who start in Greece. I've had this too, and they ignore the huge and ripe empire on their doorstep and rush straight to the middle of nowhere to attack you. It makes little sense and is actually quite annoying. Basically, the AI needs to learn priority rather than reckless agression, as it often screws itself in the process of trying to madrush whoever it doesn't like. Its funny when you are the Sassanids and can command your huge legions of vassal AI to swarm across the map for you, but everyother time, whether you're the migrating Geats in Morocco still being haunted by the Angles for no reason, or just one of the Romans watching your sister empire collapse as it runs off into the steppe, it will likely confuse and annoy you.
3) The AI also seems to get a large, almost cheating bonus to its economy. Admittedly I play on Very Hard so it might be expected, but watching Youtubers and my friends on easier difficulties, as well as a coop campaign on Hard, the AI really must be magical. Very early in the game you will see 1 province minor nations toting 2 or sometimes 3 full stacks of units, including large amounts of mercs. By turn 5 no 1 province nation will likely have the economic power to do this, as the ai never optimises its buildings as a player would, and seen as villages only have at max 3 workable slots (The village itself takes one) and a food building is an absolute must to not have your army attritioning and even upkeep buildings, they either get a magic +200 food or +8000 a turn, possibly both. Its not so much of a problem as the armies are rarely filled with good units as the ai never builds good military recruitment buildings, but having 3 stacks sent at you from a tiny nation is strange nontheless, and if a coalition of AI attacks it can be almost comical to see 12 stacks arrive simultaneously to attack you. I've also noticed that the Celtic nations of Britain, as well as some German nations, don't take snow attrition even when not camped or fortified. Perhaps this is intended, but it seems strange when every player faction expect the Geats do. 
4) Being a migrating horde seems far better than being a settled power. Infact, you can even recruit much better units as a horde than you could as a settled faction at times, which seems off. Each horde army can build 10 buildings, while a city can build only 5 if you don't include the city itself, or even only 3 if it also has a port and a resource. So these hordes can economically outproduce settled civilizations, but it doesn't stop there. They can replenish anywhere simply by entering a stance that costs only 1/4 movement, recruit very elite men and don't have to deal with sanitation or unhappiness like a settled civ. It makes them fun to play, but also makes settled civs pointless.

62,14609690,english,"This game combines the graphical fidelity and streamlined provinces system with an exciting setting, fully exploiting the Imperial drama of the Late Antiquity as the dying light of the Roman Empire is smashed under the bootheel of barbarian hordes. 

Start at the top of the food chain as the greatest Empire in history, and watch as your borders and legions deteriorate into anarchy as barbarian hordes and kingdoms swarm across your borders, or slash and burn your way through Europe as the Huns in their 15 minutes of historical fame under the great Attila.

As much as this sounds like an advertisement, I cannot stress the amazing execution of this game. With the exception of missing flavour text, I can't find any outstanding issues, excepting the occasional non-reproducable CTD. Creative Assembly have really out-done themselves here- this game really does do Rome: Barbarian Invasion justice, as the great Roman Empire implodes and Europe as we know it today is formed. Unique building chains, a technology tree tailored to your faction, improved campaign and combat AI, unit upgrade systems that demonstrate the post-Marian reforms nicely, as well as unique mechanics such as immigration and corruption that cleanly help emulate the weaknesses of large empires in any period and the difficulties the Romans faced in their dying days.

Not only has this game been executed well- it is HARD. Taking control of the Western Empire really feels like a challenge- it leaves you with few options to hold onto your remaining territories, and your starting situation leaves you only with room to decline in power. The technology tree for this faction nicely demonstrates the decline in Roman engineering and culture as Christian principles and architecture prevail in society, whilst not rail-roading you on a path of Christianisation- indeed, in my own campaign, I forsook Christianity and re-established Graeco-Romanism as the state-religion, the revival spurred by my many neo-classical buildings.

Anyway, enough of me. I was skeptical of this game at first- Rome had left me cynical. But Creative Assembly has responded beautifully, even compensating users for reused assets from the last game with a reduced release price tag. This is easily one of my best purchases in a long time.

I found i spent most of my time suring up my borders against attack, compared with Rome 2 and this plays into the whole downfall of Rome and the rise of Germanic tribes and the Invasion of the Huns from the East, so really the pre show to the Dark Ages. There is alot more strategy needed for Attila than Rome 2, so prepare to sink a few hours if you wish to complete the campaign. (wandering barbarian tribes) #prepareyouranus 

Attila has some cool new mechanics too, especially when it comes to conquest of enemy cities (you can burn them down and leave it as a crispy husk) but don't worry you can rebuild them for a fee. Food is also more effected by seasonal changes, which can ruin your armies in a harsh winter and disease now plays a more active role and you will have to find a tidy balance between sanitation and cultivation as disease is more prevalent and can be spread along your trade networks, which is always nice if you want to give your neighbour the...plague.

Rome 2 was very much an empire builder where the goal was to get as big as possible, Attila is definitely more of a survival game.  
Attila makes many improvements on Rome 2, such as obvious better visuals and improved anti-aliasing. Mechanically it is similar but the Campaign has many improvments including the Family Tree and more diplomacy options. These add to the complexity of the campaign gameplay. Battles are also much harder and have been reworked to be a bit more realistic. Units will route faster but will also return to the fight easier. Fatigue is also much more of an issue.

It has one main flaw, the lack of culture types. The game contains many factions from different parts of the known world, but we're missing Celtic, Slavic and Sarmatian units. Instead all Celts use Nordic units, Slavs use German units and Sarmatians use Hun units. It's a bit jarring and makes me miss the diversity of Rome 2, but I'm sure it'll improve in time with patches and DLC.

First of all I am not a habitual reviewr on many games, and if I do write one I usuall feel very strongly about what I am writing due to taking the time to write it. Most games fall in the middle for me and I only play a very specific type of game these days. So here ya go, Rome: Attila and its DLC.
 As a fan of TW games from its inception I have NOT been pleased with anything since ""Empire"". I did not even chance Rome II but I read such remarkable reviews from ""Attila"" I thought I would take a chance. Wow, am I extremely dissapointed. This series simply does not even resemble it's former self.

 Graphics (3/10):
 I do not know what they have done to the graphics as I am not an expert in such things but for me, so called better is actually worse. I have an I7 rig with Radeon HD something or other and I cannot realistically play this game on anything other than the lowest settings.  Thats still only getting a 15 FPS in the benchmark test.

Gameplay (3/10):
 
 Ok, so there is alot in gameplay but I will go with the basics. First the Battles. They are pure junk, not fun, very ""Arcady"". It's set at a rediculously fast pace, makes little sense and to me is just not fun or worthwhile. This is a result of people trying to make this thing waaaay more complicated than it needs to be. I realize they are shooting for depth and realism but in doing so have completely ruined the game. Want to win? Just get a bunch of armies filled with horses and run over everybody = win. 
 Next Politics: If there is a positive to be found anywhere it might be here. I liked a little more depth in negotiations with other countries which is real similar to what it use to be just better. (Take note developer). Thats all you really needed to do with this series, just make better what was already there, not change it. The ""Family Tree"" I find overly exhaustive and time consuming. I do not want to micro manage all these skill points and garbage for every stinking character.
 Armies, WTF? The Army utilities and Generals what you can do and what you can't do has turned in just on gigantic micro management nightmare. Its just a mess. I want to build what I want, when I want, I want as many armies as I can afford and I am sick of all these stupip plus or minus effects you have placed on everything from just having a town to not being able to create armies unless you meet certain specifications here there and everywhere. Its a joke.

otherwise stay away.
ui is really bad, and not intuitive at all imo.
there are annoying little bugs or ""features""
some things are to babysitting, and others are not at all (you are reminded about a character increased in lvl, but are not reminded about quite a number of other things that are more important for that turn. this is when you press end turn)

you get a message about quite a few things throughout the game, but no details.
like a general showing up offering his services for a fee, but you cant see anywhere what the fee is, and when you turn him down for that very reason, you get a message about him blabbing to everyone so mercenaries cost you +25% extra, which wasn't mentioned either (are you kidding me)

i want a wall around my city (game: oh no no, thats only for a capital. me: but its a really important city with strategic value for me. game: is it a capital...no, then you cant build a wall around it)
i think the only reason they made it this way was because the devs wheren't able to develop an ai, that could handle siege.

game: oh you want to move those 2 archers from one city to the other? you cant before you train a general to accompany them. oh you already have the max allowed generals (WTF) then you have to move your entire stack of units to the other city and exchange between stacks and move your stack all the way back to the city which have most likely been burned to the ground because there was no freaking army there.

then theres the general lack of information that you have to find through a number of button placed all over the interface for some f'ed up reason.

and the information aren't really displayed well when you find it.

and there is a day 1 dlc, which really just makes this a money grab.
there are a few decent things, but then the devs have just fallen short again.
like the barricades that they are so proud off, you get 1????? i saw a video where they where all praising that the walls of a city was destroyed patially to simulate that a siege really was taking a long time even though it was  only one or 2 turns for the player, but apparently it takes much longer to build a little flimsy barricade than it takes to destroy a wall.
and the barricades are really poor, they are destroyed by spearmen in no time, even while being manned.

i never played rome 2 because i saw it for the money grap that it was, but i decided to give this a try, and this is even worse than empire total war. because empire had decent gameplay without to much frustration (over gameplay) it was just broken with bugs. this isn't really broken with bugs, just very very bad gameplay and game design.

22,14587547,english,"[h1] Still a scam. A dumbed down, casual-gamer, streamlined application. [/h1] Yup. I didn't even categorize it as a game.

Last review was too long. I figured I should cut down and get to the point.

Point being is, if you've enjoyed the last 3 Total War titles, Attila is a great game. If you've enjoyed older Total War titles, you may not find Attila much more innovative than Shogun 2.

Lots of former features make its way back into Attila but a lot do not.

Important things to note:
- Diplomacy is still broken. Has anyone ever turned down an offer of a daughter (for marriage or being a maid?)  with 10000 coins in exchange for nothing? No? Well, Total War Attila teaches you that there are some men like that. They must be eunuchs or something of the sort.

-Combat algorithm is the same as Shogun 2 and Rome 2. Soldiers engage in 1v1. I have yet to see 2v1 or 3v1 which would be more realistic. If your friend was in a fight, would you stand there and wait until he dies before you jump in to fight his enemy? If so, you're an ***hole.

-Naval combat has improved since Rome 2 as in it goes a bit smoother. Does it innovate? No. It's not very interesting. Early navy is pointless since boarding parties are small and weak compared to troops in transport ships.

-Amy compositon is unrealistic, historically inaccurate and not practical. Players still lack the ability to hire lighter versions of units in late stages of games. Lighter versins of heavy units play the exact same way as each other which means that lighter versions are useless which is untrue is real life and should be untrue in a wargame that seeks to emulate real battle. And who likes to spend exorbitant amounts of money on solely elite units when only a few elite units are actually needed? Only the financially irresponsible.

There are some more points but you get the idea I'm trying to get at.

Rome 2 was a turd. Total War: Attila is the same turd gone through a salon and shoeshine and dressed in a lace.

34,14587189,english,"I really have a hard time immagining why this game got rated so high. Only thing I can think of is people have been in TW withdraw from the disaster which was TW:Rome 2...

Pros: 
+++ Graphics
++  Horde mode (but please see Cons)
+ AI is slightly better than in TW:R2 (not worthy of all the praise it's recieving in reviews)
+ Technology tree is actually interesting
+ Units are more diverse than in TW:R2
+ Stability (only crashed once in all my hours of gameplay)

Cons: 
------ Razing: This feature ruins this game. By turn 20 half of Europe is an empty shell. It's not until maybe turn 50 (about 4h into the game) that AI will even start contemplating re-settling those razed lands. 
--- This is basically a TW:R2 expansion sold at the price of a new game.
--- DLC on Day 1: (I bought it cause of the reviews and was extremely dissapointed. By the time you unite the norse tribes under your flag there is no one left to fight since everything is razed by turn 20). 
-- Technology is too slow; By the time you start getting any of your nation's interesting troops the game is broken (razing). 
-- As if worrying about Food, Public order and Squalor wasn't enough in TW:R2 now we also need to worry about Army Integrity (seriously?!?).

I did 7 playthroughs since buying the game, all in grand campaign. I played Jutes, Sassannids, Visigoths (by far my favorit), Western Rome (got to turn 50 and gave up, I secured my lands, protected my borders but the constant food/public order/sanitatio/integrity management just drained the hell out of me), Eastern Roman (much more manageable than the west but still as dreadfully boring), Huns (the game favors ground troops over mounted troops so they aren't as good as you'd expect them to be) and finally Gaeti (spelling?)

 The game looks absolutely awesome once you start a grand campaign, the graphics, the massive Roman empire, the more diverse units (over TW:R2) and even the tech tree is slightly more diverse, but I promiss you that sometime between turn 20 and 40 you will be borde out of your mind but you'll be like me, you'll think ""Hey maybe if I played that nation instead I'd enjoy it more"" and you will until you reach that same point again..

45,14583932,english,"So yes, this game is 'essentially' the same as Total War Rome 2, but it is also much better and more in depth. The main changes to the game are many, but they are mainly centered around the UI (user interface) on the campaign map.

The foremost thing most people will probably notice is that all the building icons have been changed (they look really cool now I think) and you have been given a TON more information about said building and a variety of stuff pertaining to the city or proviince you have selected. Specialized buildings are also available now if a city has a resource available to it, which is really cool becasue some of these resources can actually have a really big impact on your or the AI's economy and it can be devastating if you or even the AI loses one of the places. Sanitation and sqaulor have actually been given a purpose now outside of just making people happy/unhappy by balancing each other with the chance of a disease outbreak if squalor is higher than sanitation. Diseases work fairly in a really interesting way, they can spread across cities and through trade routes or an army can infect an entire other province if its sanitation is outweighed by squalor. The biggest impact of a disease is bascially just a public order penalty, building a sanitation structure in the province can easily remedie its impacts.

Apart from the new unit icons and units being faster to fatigue and breaking, not much has changed with the RTS side of Total War Attila. I liked the old unit banners I think, but once you get used to it they can be useful at figuring out what a unit is with just a glance, and holding spacebar gives you information on every unit's moral and fatigue, which is much preferbale I think to hovering your cursor over each individual unit. There is also a new icon that appears at the bottom left of an enemies unit icon when you have one of your units selected that indicates how great a threat that enemy unit is, another nice yet small change. Fatigue is a much greater hinderance than it was in any previous total war game, as it barely takes any time for a unit to become exhausted and lose moral/fighting effectiveness as a result. Thankfully I think this is faily well balanced with shorter time to recuperate stamina and more elite units' resistance to those penalties. Units can break faster, but they can also come back faster. Unfortunately I am not sure what I think of this as thus far when teh unit breaks from combat they suffer additional casualties from getting attacked in the rear. So when they stop routing they are basically useless because they suffer additional moral penalties from too many losses and if you don't have a general nearby they can route and come back almost a dozen times (true story).

Last but not least, I think I'll just touch on  a few small complaints I have and try to explain why I like this game more than Rome 2. 

During the RTS battles, the one thing that a absolutely hate with all my being is the inability to take down the 'pinned unit' tab that can take up almost an eighth of your screen during a battle. I do find it really useful for comparing unit stats, for both my units and the enemies, but it is really ridiculous that it is basically the only tab you can't minimize and it constantly has to take up so much of your screen. It also took me a while to figure out that this same tab can be further expanded and you can see more detailed unit stats, something I should have known fro the moment I started recruiting units, but there was no advance waring (though keep in mind I turn off advisor and didn't play through the tutorial/prologue). 

That is about my only major complaint apart from the faction politics system, I still find the system redundant (apart from now that you have to worry about heirs) becasue there are just too few events relative to it and nothing really has an impact on power balance unless you blow ridiculous amounts of money on really stupid endeavours. I will add though that apart from the expense apointing people to administrative positions, the bonuses you get from putting an individual into a certain 'office' is a nice added feature. 

What makes this game so much better now though, I think, is the new nomadic system and the shear importance of even a single army and how key one can be to a faction's survival. Playing as either of the Roman factions, the last thing you are worried about (apart from maybe the byzantines) is territorial conquest. You will likely be so focused on trying to keep your armies alive and consolidating your borders that there is really no time to think about conquest. Having so many factions going rampant across your borders alos impacts your income, there is nothing in the game that actually explains it (again, I have advisor turned off and did not play the prologue), but simply having any enemy army present in your territory can cause your income to drop significantly. Thus far I think it mostly has to do with trade, though there is no indication that trade is being affected or anything, you just have a reduced income. Though as much as it s a major challenge having so many full stacks against you, for the naomadic factions these armies are also an achilles heel. Most of the nomadic factions never exceed two full armies, but since they are also mobile settlements you can drastically impact such a faction's power by destroying one of these stacks. So focusing down the stacks of a nomadic faction and killing as many of them in battle as possible can be hugely rewarding. Playing as the Romans though, this is not so easy because you have very few cavalry units to start (which are invaluable in running down enemies when they are routed so you can wipe their stack) and most nomadic factions have a lot of cavalry. Early on I think this is fairly well balacned because the lack of the Romans' cavalry units can deny them running down all the enemy forces, allowing them to fight another day. This is what I really enjoy about Attila thus far becasue it makes each army in the game much more important and definetly adds a new level of survival to the game.

Points of interest

1. Razing/abandon settlements you have attacked/will lose both have good and bad effects though.
2. ABOUT TIME - proper family tree, Interesting events & unit cards you can actully tell what unit is what.
3. Battles are really good no bunching of units like bee's round honey.

BEWARE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!

AMD Cards SOMETIMES have a problem with this game soloutions on the forums have been found that work for SOME, Seems to be an AMD graphics problem before you buy this game make sure you understand this and do the following - 

1, Chipsets are using most upto date driver
2.Audio drivers are upto date
3. Graphic drivers are upto date

This will ensure that you at least have a chance to play IF THIS ISSUE HAPPENS TO YOU. DO NOT use the device manager scan for upto date driver you must use websites relevent to your hardware/software.

I have also more information on this bug/issue for anyone who needs help just add me to steam and i will help as much as I can but I if i cannot help take it to the forums and enjoy the long process of ticketing and what feels like 5 years of no reply.

53,14580817,english,"With over 300 hours of gameplay on Rome II, a game I generally like, I can confidently say that Attila is a vast improvement. The campaign is far immersive with the return of the family tree, and interfamily politics actually seem to have an understandable purpose now. The campaign AI is *greatly* improved compared to its predecessor, so no more ""Peace: Total War"" or pointless suicide attacks here. In fact, the AI has a preference for multi-stack assaults on any isolated forces you may have, so even an elite stack can get torn apart if you're not careful. Attila's grand campaign has been the first one I've outright been destroyed in since the original Rome (If you're a horde, don't underestimate the Roman Empires)! Battle AI remains comparable to or slightly bettter than EE R2's, but new battlefield dynamics and more competent sieging make battles more enjoyable in my opinion. Also, due to the new siege escalation system, gate torching is much, much rarer.

 While there are some glaring issues, the omission of Celtic, Slavic, and Berber rosters, that's almost certainly going to change with future DLCs. As it stands today, Attila is more immersive, challenging, and overall enjoyable than Rome II, I would definitely recommend this game to both newcomers and veterans of the Total War series. 

To provide a comparison, I would give R2 a 7.5/10 and Attila an 8.5/10, with the greatest improvements being in immersiveness of the campaign and overall challenge (which is the point, in my opinion) of gameplay. When Celts, Slavs, and Berber factions finally get fleshed out, I'm confident this game will be worthy of 9/10",1424544436,1424544600,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198105759594,70,4,7003,0,1063,1587986500,,

56,14580482,english,"CA implemented multiple features that were requested by the Total War community, and they did so very well. Their launch has been excellent, to the point where I can almost forgive them for the launch of Rome II. The game is very well optimized and it looks fantastic. 

Battles are a significant improvement over Rome II. Unit collision has returned, your cavalry can actually throw enemy units a couple yards after coming into contact with them, and you can actually disengage and recharge with minimal frustration. Infantry battles no longer feel like you are trying to pull apart two blobs of putty and then smash them together again. Siege engines are actually exciting and don't totally cripple your army's campaign movement, so they are actually worth investing in. Ranged units don't become totally inept when the enemy is outside of their line of sight and actually arc their volleys over walls and terrain. 

Depth has been added to politics, gravitas and influence is now used as political currency so that you don't have to cripple your economy to engage in faction politics. Governors can be instated for settlements and there are specific governor bonuses within the skill tree alongside their general counterparts. Loyalty has made a return, causing your political actions to have weight among your empire/tribe. Also, you actually have to care a little bit about whether or not certain generals and governors are loyal, because they aren't nearly as expendable as they were in Rome II. 

The UI is another improvement with more informative menus. You can access the building tree within the game without having to mess with that idiotic browser from Rome II. Unfortunately they haven't done away with it entirely as you still have unit information within the browser. 

Despite any shortcomings Attila has, even if you don't care about any of the additional improvements I just mentioned, this is going to be the first Total War game since Medieval 2 where map resources are going to be available to the modding community.

The map looks like the one from rome 2, but there have been improvements. They re-introdused the building-conversion, where you need to convert buildings to your own culture. The family tree is back, and you can now upgrate generals, armies, and agents.

The battles do have some little issues, like the one where i once lost my whole army because the instandly all fled away when my king died..... there is a lot of things wrong with the morale in this game. The towers in the towns are overpowered: they kill a lot of men, make sure you capture them quickly.

You can now loot and destroy cities. If you destroy the city, everything is gone. if that happens an other faction can settle in that region, if they have the money to do so. It is very expensive to rebuild a region.

there probebly is a lot more to tell, but after 15.3 hours this is what i think that is important to tell to everyone who maybe wants to buy this game: it's a good game if you like rome 2, if not it still isn't bad, but the older games are less expensive, so if this would be your first total war game, then go and buy rome 1 or medieval 2: the graphics are worse, but the game is better, and a lot more fun to play.

61,14577481,english,"Really enjoying this Total war! I've played since the very first game, I was worried by the end of Rome 2 that this was the beginning of the end for Total war games as i knew it!

First thing, The map like Rome 2 is very large which I was not keen on but it compliments this style of strategy with migration etc, I still liked the shogun 2 or Rome 1/MTW2 map where you can see roads getting built. The detail in the map can be too much but that is just my opinion.

Secondly Rome 2 for me felt dubbed down and no feeling to it, It just didn't grip me like other total wars, But this game has. The music to the game is absolutely amazing and gave me the feeling like Rome 1, You get a sense of feeling of the era which is really important! 

Battle -  AI has took a serious improvement, I.e I was getting a frontal attack by melee infantry and my skirmishers began         firing.. The enemy infantry acted instantly to this by using  loose formation, Then just at the point of charge impact it went back to tight formation. I noticed how the AI reacts to cavalry too, I blocked an entrance of my town square with spear units, i used my cavalry to flank while getting attacked. The AI used sword infantry to attack my front line then took spears infantry to block the flank against my horse unit, very clever as i couldn't attack his rear! 

Campaign - You really need to choose your path in migration very thoughtfully, I have been wiped out a few times now!
The Western Empire is really challenging and good fun, I am really enjoying it. One point of note though that i have noticed, If you are at war with a far away faction.. they will persue you!!! The entire length of the map!!! lol So I think this is a bug as the Caldonians brought an army all the way to Roma, which isn't realistic! Patch maybe needed for that.

Politics - Now this is something i couldn't be arsed with, but how wrong was I.. I love the political family tree, wish these were brought into Rome 2 as it is fantastic and polished.

All in all.. A really good game. I am finding people are just complaining to complain about something.. Which is becoming a trend. If you are complaining about this game then you are quite honestly being over fussy and should go play Battlefields or COD ;)

64,14576109,english,"Let me start this off by saying Rome II was a huge disappointment to me. I tried to enjoy it, I really did, but I just never managed to really get into it. Most of the time I'd end up starting a campaign and never completing it. Leave the game for a few weeks/months then I'd come back to it and try another campaign which, ultimately, ended up the same way.

I bought the DLCs hoping they'd make the game more interesting and manage to keep me hooked like the previous Total War games did. Never happened.

At first, I wasn't interested in Attila because of Rome II. Then I started watching the videos from CA and the new mechanics seemed interesting and refreshing plus it looked like CA actually listened to the playerbase. So I gave it a shot.

This is what Rome II should've been. Attila is a true Total War game.

The family tree is back.

The siege AI is working and is not totally incompetent.

The horde mechanic works well, is really fun and offers such a different play style than what we're used to in Total War games. Playing as the Huns burning down cities, pillaging and just, overall, being an ass is amazing.

The BAI has also improved and so did the naval battle AI. Naval battles are much better than they were in Rome II, not an impressive achievement considering how bad Rome's naval battles were but still deserves to be mentionned.

Now, not everything is perfect, there are bugs. Nothing major. I've had a few crashes here and there. When ending a turn the game will sometimes freeze for a few seconds when all the AIs have finished their turns. Nothing patches cannot fix.

Overall the game feels much more polished than Rome II ever did, even as an ""emperor"" edition.

65,14575402,english,"Overall this is a solid game. When you compare it to the Rome 2 release it definitely stepped up to the plate. TW introduced some new features that are pretty nice and a change of pace. Like migration (hordes), having edicts with only one city compare to Rome 2 where you had to have a whole region, family tree is AWESOME, adding enemy units to replenish your armies after a battle, etc. 

My favorite feature would definitely have to be the family tree. Its nice to actually have significance to your generals and faction. Politics in my opinion is nice... no more (or as much) random generals trying to kill yours. Some events that happen within the family is quite humerous. Like a general who has a wife yet keeps having bastard children because he likes sleeping with anyone but his wife, etc. 

Not too many problems I noticed on my PC (which is a pretty good gaming computer). Although some of my own personal problems or complaints rather is that the Huns are waaaay OP. Like insanely good and it enrages me. I've played three campaigns already because I keep getting in situations where I lose my King and heir... at that point it'd rather quit. Playing as hordes to me sounded extremely fun...but I've played them in two of my campaigns and it definitely isn't easy. If you play as a horde faction...prepare to run...A LOT.

Enemy agents will not die when you try to assassinate them, and will kill your entire family tree in a few turns or decimate your army with poison.

It works very good from day one, much better launch than Rome II :) It is a bit hard on every system out there, but can easily be run smoothly, if you are realistic when you adjust your grafic settings. There has not been a new Catalyst driver since v14.12, so based on that ""old"" driver, the game runs fine, but will look forward for it to be a little more optimized and a new Catalyst driver from AMD!     

I did read some bad AMD reviews, but i have not had any lack at all and i have a lot of ""Max Quality"" settings, but also some on ""Performance"". I do have several effect´s on and a little AA + Ultra Army size and so on.

Total War Attila, is the latest installment in the Creative Assembly's Total War franchise. That being said this is an accurate review of the game as we have seen it so far. 

I found myself noticing for at least a while now lower frames per-second than previously in Rome II, now this isn't neccessarily a bad thing because this is a very brand new non-patched game so fixes are coming but one thing I did notice overall is that this game is Rome II on Steroids. 

I began my first campaign playing as the Western Roman Empire and almost immediately on my second turn I was sacked, raided and in some cases even threatened by both the migrating factions including the Visigoths and the Celtic factions to the northern parts of Britannia. In short - This game was incredibly difficult playing on normal difficulties, each turn I was either raided or in most cases the plague struck individual towns and regions. 
Ai in this game isn't to shabby, though it has it's moments in which it does something very unprofessional the ai seemed to be working very well. Regarding these migratory factions, they seem to be foes of nearly everyone. The Huns were not interested in negotiating at all and the Visigoths already wanted my blood because on my third turn they came for me. 

TOTAL WAR: ATTILA - 
[olist]
[*] GAMEPLAY - 7.9 [b] GOOD [/b] | Gameplay is incredibly similar to that of the original Rome II, however I noticed that the barbarian/hunic factions are more so overpowered in regards to not just calvalry but all units. 

[*] CAMPAIGN - 8.7 [B] GREAT [/B] | This campaign map is absolutely stunning, almost like a much darker version of ROME II, this campaign features a fully new integrated faction family tree system as well as a new system very much similar to Crusader King II.

[*] CREATIVITY - 6.7 [b] GOOD [/b] | This game has added a lot of new features but the idea of adding GIF's instead of actual cutscenes is more so a letdown, every campaign action in this game will feature an animated GIF that is around 3 seconds long. The team has also added the migration system which I personally think is fantastic it gives the player or ai a bit of mobility around the campaign map. There is also the feature to now raze or destroy the land around a settlement effectively burning out the populace and causing starvation. Overall the creators added numerous amounts of new creative designs but not enough to really give this a high score. I understand that they may have added in the governor systems, the fact you can now demolish your own settlements to save currency and the fact that you can now select puppet states to work for you, but there is still something missing... For example in the cutscene of the WRE (Western Roman Empire) - It showed a gladiatorial battle, however there is no cutscene in regards to such an event in the game. It's nice to look at via a single cutscene but I would have liked creativity like what Shogun II had been given. 

[*] MULTIPLAYER - 6.0 [B] GOOD [/b] | Multiplayer for Attila is very much the same as generic Rome II, only the added features as the same in custom battle. You can now select the latitudes and longitudes of the province in which you wish to fight on. 

[*] REPLAY VALUE - 8.4 [B] GREAT [/b] | Total War: Attila is a game that some may enjoy and some will still enjoy, it adds a new campaign placed near the pre-dark ages during the beginning of the falter of the Western Roman Empire. There are plenty of new things to work with in regards to the campaign and the custom battles, multiplayer and let's not forget the always fun to play with historical battles! 
That being said in its currentl state Attila is based for expert players of the Total War series and those who know the true arts of war, the base difficulty is around the same as Legendary would be for Rome II and unless you wish to become infuriated at the fact your cities are getting sacked constantly I would choose to play on easy or at the most normal difficulties. 

I must say I had my doubt and I was like many unable to actually fix the dreaded logo screen crash, however using the CMD Prompt I was able to successfully fix my issue. I was still a bit cautious about this game because of the previous launch of ROME II however one things we all forgot to realize is that this engine is still run off the same one as ROME II and the mechanics are all the same with newly added features. 

That being said I = [U] HIGHLY [/u] Recommend this game.

93,14568408,english,"tl;dr: This game is great. I would highly reccommend it for people that may be fans of the Total War franchise, or not.

[h1] Gameplay [/h1]
The gameplay in this game is great. It is very familiar to many fans of the Total War series, but it is also bringing in fresh, new elements that keep things from getting old and stale. One of my favorite features is a return of a well-loved feature; the family tree. It adds much more depth to diplomacy and makes things a lot more interesting on that side of the game. (A side I've had trouble getting into). They have added no aspects that make having a purley nomadic faction completely possible. The Huns for example, can not settle cities, they just go along, usually decimating cities and razing or sacking them as they do. I've gone through a very large portion of eastern and northern Europe in my Huns campaign. It is really great fun.

[h1] Graphics and Sound [/h1]
Personally, I think the graphics are phenomenal, even on low specs thanks to my outdated computer. They are a large step up from the Rome 2 graphics which were actually pretty nasty as I look back upon it. There is an ""Extreme"" graphics setting which is intended for future GPU's to offer even better graphics for the future eras of PC gaming. Not even 980's can run the extreme graphics settings efficiently. The sound is pretty good. Nothing special, but good. My gripe with it is that they still use some of the same voices from Rome 2, namely the classic Barbarian guy voice that always shouts cliche barbarian insults and whatnot, but that is nothing too major.

[h1] Difficulty Level [/h1]
This game is difficult. Simply put. It is a very challenging game. Earning money is hard, mustering enough troops to repel an invasion is hard, and just playing it is tough. I am playing as the Visigoths on normal in my main campaign and it was tough at first, but now it is pretty easy. The difficulty isn't too bad though. It doesn't make it so hard that the game isn't enjoyable *cough*dark souls*cough* (just kidding, it's a great game).

I can't think of any other categories, so feel free to give me requests for what to put in, and I will oblige.

99,14551417,english,"So i have just finsihed the eastern roman empire campaign of atilla resulting in a cultural victory, YAY! grats for me i know. Now some of my friends have their doubts about this game so i decided to write short review: for those who know me (and those who dont as well i suppose) i will make a compairison to the earlier total war games: 

Now Atilla TW is basicly rome 2 TW with the following changes:

[h1]most notable new game mechanics:[/h1]
1) the politics system has been overhauld. It now actually does something. It did not cause mayor problems in my campaign but it has actually becomes something that you cannot ignore. and even better it no longer starts (scripted) civil wars. 
2) abandon/raze setlements. You can decided that upon capture of a settlement what to do with it. nothing new here except for a new option: raze. use this when you dont want the region the settlement is in. it will burn the town to the ground and the area arround it will become desolate. Now personally i think that this option is a little overpowered at the moment. all you have to do to win a war is send units into your enemies lands and raze every town he has to the ground. dont get me wrong, the new mechanic is strategicly valuable. however it is (imo) done too fast: razing is instantly while rebuilding a town can easily take 30+ turns and cost over 30k treasure. for an update i would suggest ensuring that razing takes time (lets say 1 or 2 turns) during which your army performing the razing cannot move. such that your enemy has a chance to either save the settlement or at least regroup its defenses. 
3) the horde factions: this game has a new type of factions: the hordes these are factions that only have armies. however these armies are diffrent from for example the roman ones. i did not have time to fully explore them since i have not played a horde race yet but if i understand correctly they can for example construct buildings within their armies i might update this review later once i understand their full fucntionalities.
4) You still have the one thing i hated in rome 2 TW: Food. The AI couldnt handle it in rome 2 and it has basicly been a disaster ever since. except now with a twist: climate change actually makes you produce less food as the game progresses. now the goal of this mechanic is to force barberian factions to migrate south. except for that it doesnt since it makes ALL farms (even freaking egypt) end up with soild rating poor/infertile. and everyone just stays where they are. all it does is force you to spend resources converting industry to farms to feed your people.  

[h1]So the good... the bad... and the dlc...[/h1]
so here we are at the overview. i will try to be brief. after all you have some gaming to do.

[b] The Good[/b]
1) this game is basicly what rome 2 TW should have been. (i.e. a working version of rome 2 TW but with some extra contend)
2) the cutsences are really well made. allthough i personally dont really care for the biblical refrences in them. 
3) politics have been overhauld until they work
4) research choices now have a bigger effect on your empire so its worth paying a lot of attention to
5) The game never *stabiliezes* arround 1 big empire. the hordes make everything dynamic and moving.  which makes it more fun
6) if things dont work in the way you want it to... you can always say: sod it! and just burn the whole place down. 
7) it already worked better at launch then rome 2 TW has ever worked
8) new gameplay with horde factions.

[b] The bad[/b]
the game has many new points... some of them i like.... some of them i did not like... these are the mechanics of which i feel that more work is required to make them work properly

1) the climate change mechanic. i can understand if you disagree but in its current state i feel that it just doesnt work. if you want to force factions to migrate you have to make one side of the map worse... not the whole map (thats what happens now) i am sorry but giving egypt and afrika a poor soil status because of longer winters in the north is rediculous. i will most likely end up just using a mod to either weaken, or remove the effect completely.
2) diplomacy is broken (just as it was in rome 2). especially if you play as romans: everyone hates you. at some point in managed to get myself into a position as eastern romans where i was not at war with anyone and i just randomly began losing diplomatic *like* points until someone declared war on me for no reason. from my experience i have the feeling that the AI uses diplomacy to actively screw me over. I mean: at the end of the game my allies in afrika, for whom i have gone through fire and flames. we fought 5+ wars together. i am finally at peace for 10 turns and they randomly begin to hate me. similarily: people who hate you at the start of the game (in the case of the romans... everyone) will remain to do so until the end of the game despite your best efforts. also: -150 diplomatic points because i am winning (have a big empire) is not really fair...
3) some research blocks some building for which there is no (new) alternative. which sucks because you really need some of these blocked buildings...
4) campaign range of defending forces and attacking forces are the same... good you say? well no it isnt... a barberian horde can just outrun your defending armies anywhere in your empire... all the while burning down your towns and cities. The same thing holds for fleets. transport ships for land units have the same range as *dedicated* fleets. which makes fleets useless since their only real use would be to intercept barberian transport ships moving towards your shores. i am not saying that defenders should have a HUGE bonus in range but something like 5% or 10% would be realistic since they have to have some change of intercepting a barberian horde at some point instead of going round and round in circles. A similar thing holds for fleets. if you go through the effort of raising a fleet it should be able to intercept enemy transport fleets before they go ashore... because once a army goes ashore, the fleet can no longer attack it.
5) the number of cities in the map has been reduced when its compaired with the map of rome 2. Its not a big reduction (i initially did not notice) but it has been reduced. which is really too bad because i would like a map with many... many more cities. more cities would also make the razing of settlements a more strategic topic. since you can use it to create buffer zones at your borders (desolate lands cause high atrition damage)
6) The AI is definitely better then the one of rome 2. I completely understand the difficulty in programming the AI but the AI makes verry unwise decisions. for example entering lands of a faction you are at war in where there are massive armies just waiting to kill you. To illustrate: Atilla lead his huns deep into my territory at some point. I dont know why because this allowed me to surround him with 10 of my own legions and completely wipe the huns out in one single, massive battle. 

[b] The DLC[/b]
you did not expect this? well with release i got the *viking dlc* for free since i preorderd.... now i just noticed this dlc is 7.5 euros... if you are thinking about it... DO NOT BUY IT. the viking factions look and act exeactly the same as the barbarian kingdom factions which you can play with the vanilla version of the game.... dear makers of the game: if you want me to pay 7.50 euros for the viking then at least make them look diffrent from the barberian ones. especially the architecture of their cities could have been made a lot better since it currently has no *viking architecture* at all. 

[h1]verdict:[/h1]
well as far as i feel, despite some things that i do not like, this game is definitely worth playing. I hope you have as much fun with it as i have had. just a reminder: DO NOT BUY THE VIKING DLC SINCE IT IS WORTHLESS.",1424387989,1424473135,True,3,0,0.504845380783081055,1,True,False,False,76561198007299273,336,33,2456,0,1930,1442685342,,

This feels like it could have easily been an expansion pack for Rome 2, many voices have been reused and the majority of the game's features are the same with the only main additions being the horde mechanic, religion and the razing of towns. If this was a £15 - £20 expansion pack it would be worth the price, the Westrn Empire is challanging, the new mechanics do add an interesting aspect to the game but releasing it as a full price game with it's own first day dlc feels extremely greedy and a little insulting.

1,14520222,english,"My initial reaction to Attila wasn't exactly positive, however after having spent some more time with this game I have to say that I feel differently about it. I still feel that in many ways that this still feels like a Rome 2 expansion pack more than a new game but I have more of an appreciation for some of the new material that has been added since Rome 2.  For one they have made it easier to see the way that other factions view you and weather the way you have been behaving is going to better your relations or make things worse, that was a nice touch. 
Going through the game as a hoard is much more enjoyable than it had been in Rome: Barbarian Invasion DLC. If I had to make one complaint about it would be that the CPU seams way too eager to raise city’s, during my first play through as the Visigoths I tried to set up a kingdom in southern France but once I got there in around 420AD I found that the fighting that had occurred while I was fighting the Eastern Roman empire had most of Italy, France, Germany and modern Belgium raised to the ground. Save for a few small towns here and there the rest of Europe, except for Spain for some reason, had become a group of wandering hoards after.
The amount of time it takes to go through loading between turns is horrible even with the settings turned to ""max performance"" even if all I was doing was waiting for units to heal midway through the game I would usually have to wait 4-5 min between turns. I am sure that this will be fixed in a patch at some point because this was a major issue that affected Rome 2 after launch so I am sure this is on the ""To do list"" at Creative Assembly.
*Sigh* Now here are my gripes about combat...
Before I get to what I think about Combat in Attila I think I need to give a little bit of context. One of the big reasons I started to play Total War games in the first place, the combat, I played the crap out of Medieval 2 and all the games that came after and they felt like they had been improving  every step of the way. When Rome 2 came out its like troop controls had gone out the window. In combat it felt like more emphasis was being placed on micro managing solders more than generaling. Now you need to pick a formation and make sure that your units actually engage the enemy and if the enemy unit flees that they will either pursue them or resume formation Instead of placing more effort on knowing what part of the battlefield you would want to hold and what kind of formation would be the most advantageous. In my experience once an enemy had been driven off the unit might just stand where they were and not move, they would  not regain formation, assist a unit that was in combat nearby just simply stand there. I don't know what the reason was for dumbing down the infantry but it all but ruined the real time battles for me I would have preferred to worry about making sure that my units weren’t abandoning the battle to chase down a unit of a handful of men that were in full retreat than of losing units that just mosh pit together and only react when getting attacked. Most of the battles I have lost are because I end up losing too many men as they get all grouped together and then they allow themselves to get flanked in all of the other games it was bad news if you got flanked but only in this one would it go so spectacularly poorly as they don’t seem to react until they are being attacked even other units smooshed in to their formation won't react those units might as well be on the other side of the map. 
I was pretty happy with the improvement that had been made to auto battle. since I wasn't exactly planning on going into real time battle I thought it was a nice touch to select how your general would approach the battle and how that would impact the fight.
When it comes to Attila I think they dropped the ball, I haven’t noticed any real changes to the way infantry or ships play in real time battle and to boot they removed the breakdown that said how the way you approached battle so while you can still select weather your general will use an aggressive, defensive or balanced approach it’s a bit of a craps shoot as to how that will affect the battle.
Trust me I want to love this game but I have a lot of hang ups on the way that Real time battle is in this game, I honestly feel like I must have missed some kind of prompt that fixes these issues if I am just not doing something right please tell me.
I would not recommend this game for anyone that is not a diehard Total War fan and even then I would recommend for the bugs to get fixed and the price to go down a bit.

TL; DR. They made some nice changes to the politics and technology but the combat feels like Rome 2 and that makes me cranky",1424207279,1424472114,False,22,3,0.510740578174591064,0,True,False,False,76561198016450332,390,4,8757,0,946,1586155723,,

Really, it's the same build as Rome, yet it feels so different, more refined, subtle... 

There are great characters and political management here, great buildings and economy (with lot of though choices between raising more money, food, units, ressources, happiness, sanitation etc it's very intricate this time), the tech research is a bit straigthforward but with some tough choices anyway, the army management is so much better, the horde mechanism very well thought.
The general feeling of the end of the world is also noteworthy, both because of the scripted events regarding Attila and climate change as well as because the campaign feel chaotic and very fluid with all the razing of towns, the migrating hordes, the uprisings of new factions, the crumbling of the roman empire etc.

I also think that the siege escalation and destructions effects works well.

Historical purists will point some strange units in the rosters there and there (vikings etc), but given the overall lack of information about the time period i feel that most of those are good compromises to flesh out some factions and not too over the top like units in past CA titles...

I started off playing as the Western Roman empire which is a real challenge but feels very realistic as I face numerous challenges and always feel like the empire is on the brink of collapse. Playing as this faction forces you to make very startegic choices in how to use what limited resources are available. For instance in my game, though I've managed to hold the empire intact so far, only really losing ground in Britain and the Adriatic I still face rebellions and barbarian raids throughout much of my territory, particularly in France. Rather than build improvements where I know they will be destroyed so I focus on building up Spain and Italy to be my core regions. 

The only thing I have not really liked so far is how difficult the home situation is in the game. While it is realistic for there to be revolts in my territories It should not be literally everywhere. Moreover, things I do to try to improve this situation are not very helpful as govenors, even with the bread and games edicts, do not over very significant help and as efforts to produce more food only raise unhappiness.

I know also from my Rome 2 experience that CA is leaving out a lot of ""content"" that they will later charge in DLC installments (cough.. see vikings below). This has been getting a little ridiculous as of late and I hope that they just give us some of the basics this time around especially ones like ""Blood and Gore"" comon CA its a barbarian based game and you left out the blood animations?!?

There are a number of definate bugs in the game but these are generally very minor and one has to remember that the game was just released and there will be much tweaking by CA down the line. For instance, on a certain minor town map if the invaders attack from the east, their General tend to get caught in a fence and be unable to move to the southh east. Also cavalry seem unsure about what to do when faced with barracades, often charging up to it before turning and moving out of missile range before running back.

30,14554781,english,"Atilla feels like Rome II but with less playable factions and less depth. 

According to a lot of reviewers, Attilla is picking up on what Rome II did wrong. They might have very well corrected for some bugs on launch but at the same time they gave up a massive amount of diversity on the map. Essentially what you have is an expansion pack for Rome II with three different factions. Do not get me wrong, there are more than three factions, but once you have played one barbarian faction you've played them all. 

The game still chugs heavily during turn changes, I have no idea what is going on but every few turns the game would freeze for a few seconds at a time. This has been a sore point for Rome 2 for a while and is surprising still given that there are way less factions in this iteration. I think it's time for a new engine- don't you Creative Assembly? (I'm rolling an i7, 12g of ram and a 970GTX, the game runs smoothly on high)

Graphics are better but still comparable to Rome 2 but they have obviously decided that the addition of blood and gore is going to be another DLC pack. This is unforgivable if you already bought it for Rome 2 and even more-so given that this game could be argued to be a large expansion for Rome 2. Other DLC will include the addition of new factions, which should also make the game run slower. 

The game is challenging and it forces you to make quick game changing decisions fairly often. With a larger emphasis on faction politics this system seems like what Rome II should have been, I would go as far as to say that if the level of depth given in this game was in Rome II, Rome II would be 10/10. Given the level of challenge the game presents itself with early on, faction politics become quite important. The challenge comes when you can't please everyone and you can never gather enough political 'points' to either please or assassinate everyone so civil war breaks out consistantly even if you only have a small state. That's not to take away from the feeling you'll get when you manage to botch an assassination but still somehow improve your favour with the person you tried to have killed. The system is definately deeper and more important this time around. 

Rewards seem to be a large problem also. Sacking settlements yield little to no reward so playing as a factions such as the Huns becomes challenging as you have to weigh up the fact that every settlement sacked will cost you men which need to be replaced. The new option to 'Raze a Settlement' is also not even worth the time. When advertised, it was said to be a lucrative option to offset the long term loss of profits, instead destruction of settlements yields little to no profit (which makes no sense, when you can loot the same town and earn more? Who in real life would just burn treasures without looting first?!). The system needs to be rebalanced, not because it's too hard but because it's not fun. 

Choosing between any of the barbarian factions (settled or otherwise) is merely for asthetics. Sassanids start in such a great position early on there is no real need to make war because almost everyone around you is your ally, you'll spend most of your time in the faction screen playing politics. Rome is so large that there is really no reason to expand any further because it'll quickly become counter productive. Hordes introduce a different play style, which some people seem to love, I'm more of an empire building guy but I can't really knock the system because it seems to be implented well. It's certainly new!

Battles have changed a bit, heavier losses when units are engaged and early game cavalry seems overpowered. Dynamic fire, looks cool but doesn't seem to do any real unit damage (you are not going to set a forest on fire and destroy an enemy army). Units seem to stand and fight for longer periods of time without routing and can even rejoin the fight if they do but the mechanic merely becomes a hinderance because you are constantly moving units back into the fight. I genuinely thought, with an emphasis on horse archers in this game (the Huns were masters of the horse and the game is kind of named after the baddest of them all), that they would be the new 'go to' unit but instead the horse archers are the same as always. The skirmish mode doesn't always work meaning, if you play as Huns, you will want to micro-manage the living hell out of them if you want to try any real world tactics such as the feined route and ambush with the unit. 

TL;DR? Changes are either hot or cold, battles feel familiar but with fancier fire. Faction management looks better with a family tree and is definatley funner. I'm not sold on the horde modes but a lot of people seem to like them so don't let that let you decide negatively. Players looking for a greater challenge than Rome II will be pleasantly surprised at that but that's about the only thing that will surprise them, if players are looking to dive into the series for the first time I would suggest Shogun II or Rome II.

Playing as a Migrating faction like the Vandals, Ostrogoths or Huns is varied and challenging. Their greatest strength is carrying their city with them as they freely roam looking for lands to burn and fertile lands to settle and build a true empire. Expect the Huns are forever restless, a true Scourge of God. The other Barbarian tribes are less unique, but do have the ability to become a horde if the huns get to close. At this time I cannot comment on the Sassanids, although them seem to be quite a thorn in the side of the ERE.

Overall I believe this game will keep me occupied just as long as Rome 2 did, if not more.

So far it's been an enjoyable ride. Attila is what Rome II should've strived to be, but wasn't. It's nothing special, just a more refined and polished version of Rome II.",1424398800,1424398800,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197999763161,261,25,8826,0,576,1566931882,,
39,14553355,english,"Before you read this review just know that Ive played every total war game since Rome: Total War. I play these games for their immersive and entertaining campaigns. I am a big fan of the total war games and have enjoyed most of them. 

Lets talk about the pros first. Alright so Ive played this game for two days now and I have many things to say about it. First off, the campaign is decent. They have brought back the family tree and even added in depth aspects of the tree which can help you feel more in control of your faction. Secondly, the campaign map is less graphics intensive which can make some people happy. The world looks darker and not as beautiful, but I guess that fits the game perfectly, it is Attila afterall. The campagin has improved in most areas and regressed in others. If you are a long time Total War fan you know what im talking about. 

Now the cons. First off, the building chains are really confusing and complex, almost to the point where expert Total War players may have a hard time getting used to it. There are many types of new buildings and technologies that flat out confused me. Maybe I just havent spent enough time with the game. I constatnly felt like I didnt know what to build next and would hurt me or benefit me. There is just so much stuff to worry about now like squalor and various things that kinda take the simple fun out of the game. As far as the battles go, I feel like they regressed big time. It still feels stale and the battle animations are so plain. At times it feels like the men shrunk and you can hardly even see the troops fighting to the death. Additionally, they got rid of the unit banners and turned them into small tiles that you have to squint to see. Controling and selecting your regiments became hard as well. I feel like this type of old warfare is getting old too, especially since the battle and death animations are horrid. Although the game has made some big strides it still feels like its getting old. I really enjoyed all the Total War games before Rome 2 and I hope they change the pace with a new Empire game. Anyway I am going to vote no on buying this game but just know that it has some positives too. If you are new to the Total War series you dont know what you are missing so go ahead and buy this game.

Traits and retainers are organized neatly, and it's easy and enjoyable to connect with your characters and your faction. Rosters at the moment are varied and interesting, with some strange mechanics in the tech tree with upgrades. I dislike that cheap units that you might use as a meatshield are eventually upgraded to elite, expensive units, and the cheaper units can no longer be used. The unit upgrading system is interesting, but it needs some work in its current state. Battles now feel more fluid and faster paced than Rome 2, though they will still often take the same amount of time. Axe units now have their own animations, and are even their own subtype of unit. The battle maps as well as the campaign map have an interesting dark tone to fit with the apocalyptic theme that the game is going for.

Loads from Steam in under 10 seconds (15 without DimmDrive), loading last save in less then another 10 seoncds so its very fast to get into gameplay.  Map-empire overview needs optimising as its 3-30+ fps even with resolution down.
8000 unit battles in city area run approx 48fps although any water laggs the screen.
SLI loads evenly and CPU loads between 4 main cores around 40-70 load.
Personal view in hindsight of Rome2 release - much better and with optimising will be another stunning game to enjoy.
My one grrrr is the gamma is very dark meaning, meaning I need to have my Nvidia settings almost to extreme when playing (maybe its just my old ancient eyes)

Pro's:
-Graphical increase scales nicely
-Difficulty
-New management sysems more in depth management of family
-UI throwback to the midevil total war system of upgrading units by having upgrade trees nothing you wont instantly recognise if your a vet
-Vets will have no problem jumping in
-Dificulty increased
-Units attack and defend smoothly you dont seem to have the 5 min stand offs that ROME had.
-Better tech tree's ""IMO""
-Faster Load times!
-You can assign offices and region Governerors
-Additions of mechanics dating back to midevil total war like the tree look and upgrades of characters.
-Family mechanics! added complexity to each turn!
Pro/Con:
hords after playing for a while im editing this to say that the computer makes use of this mechanic for no apperant reason so im still not convinsed it works as intended.

CON:
Hords? this is a personal opinion however. you might like :)
Bugs that cause crash to desktop (since this is a day one review) 2 times so far
Performance suffers

I cant think of many cons right now except for whats listed.

Attila is a nice change of pace from Rome, it is harder especially if you try the crumbling empires. The new mechanics added to the game are basically overhauled tech tree with more tech to choose from. Family mechanics however these are easy and havnt impacted my games but could have if i didnt pay attention. The battles seem to flow better the units attack swiftly so i dont feel like im watching a stale mate when heavies are attacking each other which is nice. The biggest addition though if your coming from ROME is the addition of migration and hords, you can abbandon your settlements and turn your whole civilization into a hord which makes all your towns into units that can settle. you can upgrade your hords with buildings etc however you wont get the raw income like a city however your mobile. the downside to this is when you convert you loose all your upgrades and buildings, then you have to start over when you settle your hord. so basically you use it as a last ditch effort to run but if your doing that bad chances are your not going to last long anyway. one way to use Abbandon is if you see a large army coming to attack your settlement you can abbandon it for cash but you loose everything doing so gaining money. (not allot eather) They have brought back marriges and a few old family mechanics from the older games that seem familier however i cant remeber to pin point it for you. 

Honestly I like the changes and additions however if you really like rome and your on the fence on buying due to the price i would honestly wait for a sale since the additions add to the game however dont feel like they are really all that important. one game i barely used the family tree and won the campaign so i dont know if it impacts to much (i will update on after a grand campaign) so to sum it up i feel like this game is Rome with the mechanics of the previous games like midevil adding hords that you really dont use unless you have to (the huns start as hords) its a fun step in the right direction.",1424204629,1424375994,True,6,3,0.570868253707885742,0,True,False,False,76561197970805832,508,6,14462,0,2162,1464057362,,

Total War: Attila is quite likely the best game in the total war franchise. Maybe not the best for its time but by a close margin I'd put it just ahead of M2. 

[h1]Gameplay:[/h1]
[list]
[*]Amazingly diverse campaign playstyles (empire in decline, migrators, conventional start and safe empires)
[*]Battle mechanics are improved (fatigue and morale are more intersting, units return to the fight more and you have to give more thought to fatigue (tired quickly but you also recover faster, makes running more tactical).
[*]Balance so far feels very good, nothing is insanely OP (that I've discoverd yet)
[*]Unit diversity is huge, there are a wide range of factions and faction styles which makes the game intersting and I predict will increase replayability.
[*]Battle AI (including siege) is substantially improved from previous games, it now makes logical decisions (I've found they're a tiny repetitve however.
[*]Family tree is highly immersive and complicated which gives greater depth to the game (especially in the long run)
[*]The economic system is a fair bit more complicated than R2 and is more interesting as it changes over time (climate change) and involves an increased number of relevant variables (immigration, religion, desolation/raiding etc.)
[*]Diplomacy feels similar to R2 but slightly more polished, the ability to gift factions to migrator factions is a nice addition. Overall small improvement here.
[*]Siege escallation is great fun and adds more complexity. Gladly the AI also makes good use of this most of the time (at province capitals)
[/list]

[h1] Graphics/Performance [/h1]
[list]
[*]Played on a GTX970, i53570k on a 4k monitor.
[*]Textures etc. are a small step up from R2, they aren't amazing up close though.
[*]Good detail in units
[*]Game performs above 30FPS at 4k on 'performance' (with some max performance mixed in), drops to high twenties when I zoom in with a large number of units.
[*]Overall performance is okay but could improve, the forward looking approach of the 'extreme' graphics settings is comendable to help ensure their game lasts.
[/list]

[h1] Meta Stuff [/h1]
[list]
[*]Day 1 DLC is annoying but common in the industry, neither a negative or a positive
[*]The fact that they've made the improvements that the community have made (on the whole) is highly commendable. They appear to have learnt from their errors.
[*]If you liked R2 you'll love this, if you didn't like R2 you may find some enjoyment in this game but it won't amaze you.
[*]I haven't encountered any game breakings bugs, the new path drawing system however is a little bit unreliable though.

89,14542570,english,"  I really enjoyed this game so far, it brought back some of the things that were missing in Rome 2, like a proper and playable game at realease (pun intended). The unites are fluid the graphics are over the top (that is if you have a powerfull enough machine, otherwise they are similar to Rome 2). Since Empire Total war that i did not have so much fun in a TW series like i'm having now. There's some polishing and patching to do still it's an awesome and solid release.

Pros:
        -Family tree;
        -Awesome Campaign, so excited to see the Huns burning the empires;
        -Reliable and (kind of) balanced unites;
        -New skill trees much more simple and easy to acess;
        -Nomad tribes brings a new feature to the game;

Cons:
         -Not much an improvment in the series, more like a polish on Rome 2;
         -Mac version needs urgent optimization (well what did i expected is a mac);
         -Politics hard to understand and mess around, much like Rome 2 politics are still a big part of the game and in my opinion should be more intuitive and easy to get around;
         -Incoming insane amounts of DLC that gonna rip my wallet apart;

 

Overall 8/10, possibily one of the best games of the year so far and certainly the best RTS for me.

Total War: ATTILA is still a huge comeback from Rome 2 
and the people who worked on the game earned the according credit for it.

Battles run way smoother and feel authentic in a unprecedented way, without any glitches or ridiculous AI issues. 
In fact, so far, the AI actually proved quite impressive in a few ways, notably that it truly feel as though each single soldier of a unit is independent whilst charging or breaking it's way through enemy lines.

All the new family, political, cultural and historical facets of the game also make it that much more addictive 
to play and rediscover one turn at a time as you realise this is what Rome 2 should have been and felt like upon it's release.

Some things are litterally copy-pasted from Rome 2 but I guess we can't really blame them for that. It's litteraly what they did previously with Napoleon in order to save their Empire period title.

The Campaign map could be better optimised as it tends to get laggy, even though it does look prettier than ever before and that my processor and RAM could obviously get a little improvement as well.

For a launch it seems like the developpers finally did their homework and gave the players what they wanted and expected.

We can now only hope upcoming updates or patches will make this little strategic jewel even better.
I also wonder if the developpers will once again go on a DLC mayhem in order to get sell more content because I must say even with the Viking Forefathers pack, I felt like a few additional playable factions would have been nice to have in the original game download.

95,14541200,english,"Since the game is mostly great and a massive improvement over Rome 2 I'll just name cons. Non-gameplay/Business related cons appear below. Won't mention performance/lag/technical bugs.

Cons:
-3000 base income ruins the game balance, Garamantian tribesmen armies larger than the Roman army... Can be a good thing if you love fighting battles since you get to fight more but if you're into the grand campaign then bad news for you.
-Combat is A LOT faster than Rome 2. More about fast reaction times and less about decisions.
-Diplomacy AI still poor, getting a trade agreement is hard, random war declarations without reason by very friendly nations, marrying your daughters to barbarians have a low chance even if they're young and have a beneficent trait. Also getting peace treaties seems to be impossible unless you're massively stronger over whoever you're offering peace to.
-Politics are slightly confusing although definitely an improvement over Rome 2
-Most stances are still useless
-Can only gift regions under very limited circumstances,  for example you can't give the revolter Egypt his land back so he remains as the random Libyan province it revolted from.
-Although the building tree is definitely an improvement over Rome 2, some buildings are useless (For example tier 2 is 400 income, tier 3 is 400 income, -2% build costs and -4 food, +4 squalor). If it was say 700 income, -50% local build costs and -30% regional build costs I'd consider it.
-Speaking of useless, several character traits/ancillaries/etc are useless (-10% sanitary building costs, really) although it's still an improvement over Rome 2 considering there are now 3 ancillaries.
-Resources aren't as useful as they should be. Rome 2's DeI had it right by limiting almost all buildings past tier 2.
-Apparently several people on the steam Attila forums have reported that while migrating as the Saxons, Danes, Juttes, Gothes, Franks, etc. they were pursued all the way to their destination by random neighbouring nations which proceeded to kill them with full stack armies. I played as the Saxons myself to test this and while migrating to Greece I had 3 neighbouring German tribes declare war on me and follow me all the way to Constantinople with full stack armies just to kill my horde.
-Imperium increases exponentially for no reason even if you haven't expanded, giving massive relation penalties with everyone and eventually resulting in the whole world declaring war on you.
-Very minor but generals don't move their mouths while giving speeches

Non-gameplay/Performance/Bad Business practice cons:
-No Blood and Gore on release day even tho some previewers stated they had it. They basically didn't want to have 'Day one DLC' except their pre-order bonus.
-No Steam Workshop on release day.

What people have to consider is that games are not like 10 years ago. Nowdays developers have to spam out content in oder to have the money to survive. And that results in games beeing realeased in an unperfect state. But then wee benefit from this way of gaming industry too, the amount of people working on this game will fix the bugs and make new content. Where they before in time just would go make a new game.

Over all i think that Attila is an alot better game than Rome II was on realease.

Attila runs more smoothly than Rome 2, has a surprisingly adaptive AI

The family tree feature adds alot more to the game as well by making
you ensure loyalties and that your family line doesnt come to an abrupt end.
There's also the massive nuisance of desolation, being forced to resettle
a desolated area can take a huge toll on manpower and funds and is a rather
effective way to create a buffer zone between you and angry hordes.

the recycling of Rome 2s voice-acting.

I was skeptical at first when I didnt realize it was its own game even after watching the trailer (it seemed so similar) and I was especially unimpressed when I started to see some of the same stuff as rome 2 in trailers, but as soon as I loaded it up, I was enthralled. 
      First off, I hated Rome 2 because no matter what I did, the campaign map was going at about 10 fps. 6,000 man battles were fine, but the campaign map just wouldnt work. well, the moment I turned this on it was smooth and 100 times better than rome 2's campaign map for me. 
      Not only that, but the setting is way more interesting than I expected! I was ready for basically the roman empire with the same tribes around it and maybe some huns, but I was really excited to see some different and historically accurate factions and units. It was actually like a totally different era even though it was only a couple centuries later.
       None of those compare to my favorite part: It made me excited for total war again! I feel like rome 2 was starting to move in the wrong direction and Attilla really changed that. It reminds me so so much of a way better medieval 2 (my favorite game of all time) and Im already insanely hooked after only a few hours.

In Rome it felt like each battle was meaningless; you were probably going to win, and even if you didn't, the only consequence was losing out on some meaningless conquest in the corner of the world.

In Attila, it is entirely different. Playing as the Eastern Romans, if you do not meet the enemy in the field and win, the barbarians will raze and pillage your cities. You are not fighting for glory, you are fighting for survival. I get nervous for each outnumbered battle I fight, because I know that if I lose, I am opening up my heartland to irrevirsible destruction.

So far the only bugs I have experienced involve pathfinding issues, which occurred when a fortress spawned on a slope, and despite the walls being buried underground, I could still not send units over them. However, this seems like a minor issue to me.

On the optimization side, I have experienced no problems whatsoever with my year-old graphics card. I'm pretty sure that all the people complaining about crashes/low framerates are too ignorant to update their drivers, so... sucks to them?

24,14537905,english,"* This is a review in progress, for it's too early for me to review this game fully*

Total War: Atilla is almost nothing like its Predecessor, Rome 2. In my opinion, Rome 2 was not a terrible game. Rome 2 was just plagued with bugs that got ironed out too little too late. Rome 2 was overall a good game. Atilla is taking a good game that is Rome 2, and making it great.

Pros:
- The graphics are a step up from Rome 2's, and the color palette is more realistic, with a bit of Early Dark Ages thrown in the mix.

- Migrations and Hordes work marvelously. You can scorch the earth so your enemies get nothing, and become nomadic, looking for a new place to call home. This is what makes the Huns and the factions among The Great Migration so unique and frankly fun to play as. Also, the Huns can't capture territory, but they can Sack, Raze, Subjugate, and utturly destroy their enemies.

- Make no mistake, Total War: Atilla is unforgiving on the difficulty. You thought playing as the Eastern or Western Roman Empires would be easy? Think again. They have numerous enemies, overstretched borders and overstretched militaries. But that's the fun of playing as them. Maybe you, the player, can rewrite history. This can be a Pro or Con depending on the person, but this is a hugo Pro for me. Rome 2 was way too easy.

- Grand campaign is a lot more interactive than Rome 2's. It sort of reminds me of Total War: Medieval's grand campaign where historical events would happen (i.e the rise of the Mongols). Objectives are not useless either in Atilla, in Rome 2 they were somewhat useless, and the objectives can be challenging depending on the player.

- Political intrigue has been overhauled as well, sort of going back to the Shogun 2 way of doing things, which is great. Whether it be royal marriages, embezzlement, promoting a statesman to a position of honor, or a family member to goverern a province, you can find ways to pass time while at peace.

- The overhauled Raze option after taking a city is awesome. You can obliderate a city, watch that section of the map burn with fire, and it is uninhabitable without recolonizing it. So fun to use in Campaign mode.

Cons:
(most of these issues are fixable given time)

- I don't know why, but for me I occaisionaly have screen tearing occur in Atilla. It happens rarely fortunately, but it can get annoying while seeing the screen start to get cut up. Restarting your game gets rid of this issue, for some reason.

- while waiting for your turn to begin again, or even right when it begins, the game has a chance to freeze, or crash. It's happened to me about 4 times already. Hopefully this is another issue that is to be fixed.

In the end, Total War Atilla is worth 45 dollars, and I give it two thumbs up. You'll be occupied with Atilla for many hours to come, as I already am.",1424311316,1424311629,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198011090576,201,12,2125,0,1128,1579151768,,

Love the improved forms of faction management with governors and such, and the return of the family tree is a welcome sight too. The Horde system was a very positive surprise to me, because I felt that that of RTW:BI didn't really catch the true feel of nomadic horde life. The AI doesn't seem overly different from that of Rome II, but it does operate noticably better, both on the campaign and battle maps. In general, a great majority of flaws Rome II had have been mended in Attila. The period and peoples seem rather well historically researched, and I'm surprised to learn of several new tribes I never knew of, good on ya CA! That being said, I did notice (as IGN mentioned) a lack of 'proper' celtic troops. The Caledonians, Picts etc. don't seem to field many celtic troops. Hopefully a later patch might fix that. The atmosphere in the campaign map is solid, there's a genuine feel of impending dangers and unstability. Finally, the soundtrack is very well done (as are most of TW ost's). The 'hunnic/mognolesque' feel some of the tracks have gave me goosebumps.

I'm playing on a laptop. Here are the specs:

4700mq I7 @ 2.4ghz
12gb RAM
GTX 765m with 2gb VRAM

I was not expecting to play this game anywhere near ultra quality as I could only play Rome II on high with AA and SSAO off. However upon launch of the game my GPU wasn't recognised. Instead the game picked up my integrated chipset at 1gb surprisingly (Is it common to have 1gb of integrated VRAM?). Anyway I followed my usual protocol for when this happens, which included messing with my control pannel setting and making sure I had my current drivers.

Unfortunately the game still didn't recognise my GPU. I had to use the Nvidia Inspector to manually change some settings to remedy the situation, specifically:

""Enable application for Optimus"" -> SHIM_RENDERING_MODE_ENABLE, because for some reason this setting defaulted to "" SHIM_RENDERING_MODE_INTEGRATED"" Which is highly annoying when your control pannel specifically says that the game will utilize your high performance GPU.

TL;DR : Use the Nvidia Inspector, NOT NVIDIA CONTROL PANNEL for any problems with your GPU.


Once those problems were over I was able to mess with my quality settings to get an OK average framerate without having the NPCs look like polygons and the ground look like 1x1 mud swatches...

Once I booted up my first game as a Celtic nation HOLY SHIT this extension is so much better than Rome II, and so far I haven't experienced any bugs. So much has improved from Rome II, but without playing much into it I really don't want to make any solid statements about the improvements. This looks a lot like what CA used to make as far as Total War is concerned, definetely look into picking this up if you're a Total War fan.

40,14524971,english,"There alot to say about this game..

   --Let me start here. It IS worth the money.. IF you don't own Rome 2 or if you don't expect drastic change. 
While I think this game is great so far I can only say that it seems like rome 2 but with a few extra additions. This could 100% have been a addon from Rome 2 (minus a few extra effect and additions the game made) 

      


       Now you might ask ""What changed""..let me tell you...
-Lot's of Faction Diversity
   Now each Faction in Campaign and in battles have their Strong Suit.. Now you can argue that that has been in the game forever, but to the scale that it has increased since the last games has strongly improved. What might Work witht the Saxon (i.e Mass Melee Infantry) may not work with Huns (Reallly sucky Melee Infantry) and vice versa. There is lots of more pre-game planning now in my opinion.

-Extremely good balance
   While some might say that Huns are completely op I say ""Have you played or do you suck..."" THere is NO ONE SUPER-Power Faction in this game. Everything CAN be countered. You just need to either time something right or setup the correct army or whatever you need to. For the most part, this is in my opinion the most balanced Total war in a while. (P.S. If anyone says that the game is unbalanced they are lieing. They just suck and probably don't know that Sword Infantry can't beat Horse Melee... that's like trying to destroy a tank with a rock... it doesn't work XD)

-Seige
   They took a mode I dared not play a second time on Rome 2 and made it into one of my favorite modes in this game. The escelation system is amazing (because I cried for it for years). That and the Barricade system is really intresting. You can divert forces by putting barricades in their way making them either try to destroy it or have to go on a path you set for them.


     That's the biggest changes to the game, but there is one problem that I feel almost makes me not like the game (but I got over it fast.. but some might not)


IT LOOKS VERY IDENTICAL TO ROME 2!!!

  With all the changes they made it still seems to have a Rome 2 vibe and look. Trust me it will annoy you for a hour or two, then you should be fine. But for people looking for a game to look completely new. you might be a bit disapointed.


   Besides that issue there is little to nothing I don't like about this game... again, COULD have been a addon for Rome 2 in my opinion, but for the things they added it's worth the money.

42,14536247,english,"Total War: Attila at first seems like just an expansion to Rome II. It does, in fact, take place directly after the events that transpired in Rome II. The gameplay looks similar and I had no problems getting down to business. Mostly getting my Vikings slaughtered on the field of battle, but that’s just Total War for you. As I said, the map movement, UI, and combat operate just as Rome II did. That is where the similarity stops. The political system has been overhauled and offers a bunch of different options from marrying off your kinsman, assassinating them, or gaining their support. Similar to Rome II after a couple of patches, but this system feels much more refined. It also allows you to see if your cousins and uncles are going to come chop your head off because you made some bad decisions, i.e. civil war. The battles seem to be very much the same, but additions like the icons that indicate which directions your soldiers are facing were much needed, and a welcomed improvement. The unit tiles also give you a little extra information regarding their strength and demeanor. I have seen many people complaining about performance, and yes there is a bit of stuttering when you end turn. Just like every other Total War game that’s been released in the last 2 or 3 years. They just like to future proof their products, and I can’t blame them for that. I look forward to the future of this game, and for all of the TW's to come.

43,14536345,english,"        I have played every single total war game ever, I started shogun 1 when I was 4 years old. I have a minimum of 10 hours on games like empire... and hundreds and hundreds of hours on games I really enjoyed, like Shogun II and Medieval II (and Rome II after the Emperor Edition...) So obviously I have had a lot of experience with the games. But good as those games were, they have nothing on Attila. Now, I find it a bit of a stretch to say it is the best total war game yet, but if it isn't, then what is? Medieval II was great, but it's time is past. The graphics are almost painful to play with in this age where technology is so advanced. Attila is just a step forward in so many directions, it's ridiculous. The graphics are slightly better than Rome II, and certainly better than any other TW game. The campaign mechanics are phenomenal, they bring all the good parts of past campaigns back, and add in new, better parts. For example, the horde mechanic is SO fun to play as. You can lay waste to the empires, and there is a small chance the nation will be able to deal with you as they have many problems on their hands. However, they are still a force to be reckoned with and you'd better run if they come your way. 
       Also, the battle mechanics are amazing! the seiges are AWESOME and each city has stellar work put in to it to make it unique, ending the problem in Rome II how every city in a district looked the same, making defensive seiges very, VERY boring. But even the random cities in Attila have been changed. Also, Attila has finally dealt with a problem in all tw games... the damaging affects of the battle on the terrain. Now, everything you do can affect the battlefield; from accidentally (or purposefully) burning down a forest to scorching the earth with your catapults. No other Tw game has come even close to this (I'm not counting Rome II's pathetic attempt where trees with brun for a couple seconds then fizzle out). 
       There are a few problems, however; things they removed that I didn't appreciate. For some reason CA thought it would be a good idea to remove the bar at the end of a battle that showed you how many kills you got. This is not a problem in 1v1, but in 2+v2+ games, especially multiplayer, it removes a sense of achievement; that you cant figure out who had the most kills. CA, if you are reading this, PLEASE ADD IT BACK IN!!! Also a minor problem, they removed the function to duplicate units in custom battle. This is a really small problem however, and the amount of Pro's in the game overwhelm the small problems I have. GREAT JOB CA!!! I think this is hands down an amazing game and I recomend you buy it.

The lastest chapter in the Total War series launches this week with ""Attila"". In this game you pick up as the Roman Empire begins to crumble and the Huns are inmvading from the East. Blah, blah, blah. What we really have is an expansion of the Rome II game that the Creative Assembly wants us to pay full price for. And what do you get for your extra $45? Not much.

• The same European map 
• Only 10 out of 56 playable factions  
• Basically the same gameplay
• And of course the opportunity to pay for more DLC

There is a new feature that Attila adds: The ability to be a nomadic faction, or ""hordes"".  More than just fortifying your army, you become your own mobile city with buildings and such. It IS a cool new feature, but it only works if you don't own a city. Once you ""settle"" and quit migrating, that option is gone.

+ That atmosphere is supported with great non-gimmick campaign and combat features. Dynamic fire, hordes, migrations, famine, deseases, decimations, political intrigues, land fertility (you can pretty much burn the shit out of your enemies and left nothing but a desolate lands). Game forces you to do some gruesome stuff to survive - sending troops to plunder distant enemies, razing their settlements (or even your own if shit gets heavy). Your good old plain vanilla map painting might work at some point, but it wont be as enjoyable as using those cool features. It is a great thing just by itself.
+ AI and Diplomacy are surprisingly manageble, still a subject for improvement though.
+ Proper family tree, character development, military tradition, technology and management systems.
+ So far you have 3 factions archetypes - big empires, barbaric kingdoms and nomadic people. Factions Inside those groups are very similar to each other, but groups themselves offer you different gameplay styles
+ Siege battles seem OK to me, the best ones in series for sure. Dynamic fire, proper defences and morale system are doing good job here.

- Game doesnt look better than Rome 2, but somehow performes worse.

- Lazy naval battles. Woops, not a great time period i guess..

There are some problems with the combat engine for example a half group of archers (very light missile infantry) murdering my full strength cavalry (medium meele cavalry) in meele combat 1 on 1, and a few other quirks but these seem to be isolated events and not a normal thing.  Overall I am sure that the total war modders will not let me down on fixing small issues like these and giving awesome reskins etc.  The tech tree took a minute to get used to as well as the political system but they are fairly solid and comprehensive.

72,14522152,english,"So after the catastrophe that was the release of Rome 2 everyones wanting to know if this is better. Well, I think getting run over is better than Rome 2's release, so obviously it is better. Rome 2 did get fixed up but it took a hell of a long time to get it right. But yes, this is better than Rome 2.

THE GOOD:

In fact, the campaign is absolutely fantastic, it's got the best atmosphere of any total war game I've played, obviously I am likely to edit this review as I sink more hours into the game, so far my first campaign as the Geats (a DLC Viking faction) has been enjoyable, sailing around, plundering wealthy coastal settlements and generally not giving a f*ck (stealing money, send it to strengthen my capital and smoke weed everyday). 

However, I dabbled a little bit with the other factions campaigns and there is a so much diversity in the general feel of each group of factions. You can feel playing as the Romans that their days are numbered and it's damage control from the get go, the  Sassanids are the new big power and are ready to rise up and become a dominant force and replace the old, frail empires in the west. The barbarian tribes have a fight for survival, scrabbling to hold their lands against the behemoths that are both Roman Empires, but the threat of hordes coming and destroying your lands and your people is ever constant, so you always have a lot to think about. The hordes are well, hordes. You are what keeps the 'civilised' people awake at night, especially as the Huns who can't settle, only loot and raze. 

Sieges are an absolute delight as well, the defenders being able to craft barricades in the street really adds another dimension, the fire spreading throughout the city is great to watch, while the defeneders have the strategic advantage behind their walls and barricades, fire weakens their stats and morale, creating a better balance of gameplay. Each main faction looks great as well, this belongs in the bad section but since Im already talking about it I should mention that some of the unplayable barbarian factions are too similar, there's absolutely nothing to distinguish them from each other apart from their faction sigil. However the Roman soldiers look great, a far cry from the glorious looking legionaires you had in Rome 2, these legionaries are much uglier and darker (but in a good way).

The family tree is a welcome return, however it doesn't cast off everything that Rome 2 implemented, taking some of the good things like influence and political occurences. What was a disorganised mess, but a good idea in rome 2 has now been refined to something which is much easier to get to grips with.

THE BAD:

Mainly technical, but the one gameplay flaw I can spot right now is the razing mechanic, while it is a great thing they've put in the game, once you raze a settlement, the land in that province is now classed as 'desolate' and inhospitable. This certainly is an interesting mechanic though I fear that as a campaign progresses there is a danger of too many places becoming 'desolate' and there being not enough towns and cities to take. This is yet to be seen of course but it seems all too likely a problem.

Time between turns is unforgivably long, I've gone and made a nice brew (cuppa tea for you Americans) in the time it takes for turns to finish. Not to mention loading times for battles are huge. Once it gets going, its great, but have a book with you to read between turns, perhaps an encyclopedia on Roman history? 

Graphics optimisation is once again, poor. I can run Rome 2 fairly well at medium-high settings but it's very difficult to run this game anything higher than low settings. This wouldn't have bothered me so much if there was an increase in visual quality but it all looks the same as Rome 2, albeit a bit more brown, dark and gritty. For so little difference in visuals yet a huge decrease in performance it really is an irritating situation. Check your specs before going into it to make sure you're able to run it well as on low settings it does look pretty pants. 

Technical issues aside, the game has fantastic gameplay mechanics and is a bloody good job by CA.

graphically the game is much better, the terrain is detailed and a pleasure to look at, the new styled menu's can be a bit confusing early on but worth sticking with till you can find everything you need.

78,14530461,english,"A great game and an excellent addition to the Total War series.
 Difficult and engaging in equal measure, probably something of a baptism by fire for anyone new to the series but likely to be more rewarding the more you play.
 The return of a (vastly improved, and I say that as someone who loved the older family tree systems in Rome, Barbarian Invasion and Medieval 2) family tree and more numerous personality traits really helps to both create a sense of attachment to the characters and a feeling of narrative. 
The politics system is good but could maybe do with a little more in terms of hints on how to balance things as this felt a little unlcear to start with (that said I skipped the tutorial and had the Advisor option turned off so maybe this is my own fault :P ). Once you get to grips with it though it is simple to understand and the need to balance the influence of various characters adds another dimension to the game.
This might not be a good game if you are looking for instant gratification, it not only rewards attention to detail but tends to punish rushed or badly prepared actions quite harshly. 
Battles compare favourably to Rome 2 and feel challenging but not frustrating. 
The game is quite demanding and I suspect if you were using the recommended specs from steam the graphics would look less than impressive, I would recommend having a look at review sites or youtubers and seeing what specs they were using. 
There a great deal of variety between the factions in terms of the starting positions with everything from small settled tribes, rootless nomads, great empires on the verge of collapse and rising powers with strong starting positions.

80,14530374,english,"After 10 hours of play I can already say this game is a lot more than just a ""this should have been a DLC"". It has everything Rome II lacks and more. 
The new city razing mechanics is awesome, you literally destroy the city and the region becomes desolate. On this point I will say it seems the AI uses it too much. On my campaign map I have tons of regions desolated. You can resettle those but it cost money and food, and it seems the AI considers it too expensive because I have not seen them settle one. But that's just some tweaking stuff, no big deal. 

Faction politics is much better than before, not only thanks to the family tree, but you also have much more options available with characters. Choose wife, embezle money, raise support, assassinate (of course), choose your heir, and plenty more. The offices system is more visual and intuitive, governor mechanics is very useful (saved me from starving more than once), and the blend between dominion and control resulting in faction power is a nice expansion on the simpler Rome II system.

I don't if it's just me but the game feels more balanced, battles feel better and more dinamic. Units rout to come back later if not totally obliterated, in Rome II once they routed you pretty much lost them. Here you have more second chances if you play your strategy well. It really matters how you engage the enemy and the AI seems more responsive. 
Battle maps are also much more detailed, really beautiful to look at, and have more strategic values.
I still miss having more landing points for navies. It can be a pain to fight mixed battles because of that. 

Naval battles feel pretty much the same, no big improvement as far as I know.

Overall the game is very good. If you come from Rome you will notice the difference. Especially with loading time, Attila is much faster. Not with the turns though, ending turn is still a pain, but when faction numbers start to drop (even by just 4 or 5) speed increases a lot.

I've been playing with the Jutes and it's a lot of fun. They have some powerful units and traits. I'm playing on normal difficulty and the campaign seems harder than rome's normal difficulty, AI is not afraid to declare war just when I'm weaker on their side, catching me completely unaware, while they cooperate with my other enemies to take me down. It is much easier to get people angry at you in attila, as soon as you get big, everybody will hate you for it.

oh and the raze ability that makes you feel like a fu%?&!$ badass!

Now for the in-game combat : just wow the combat in this episode feels refreshing because it does not deal whit horrid combat that rome did i think and i may be telling bs but i think they took de combat systeme of arena which is more combat focused and as huge impacts, when u see your men fight u see how well and responsive the combat feels flanking attacks feels great and gives the impression of a huge impact in the enemy, leaders feels less overpowered that in rome 2 making a bit more exciting then just for exemple rushing your rome 2 spartan champions in 3 stacks not giving a fuck and cutting them to pieces now there good but you cant be ruthless whit them as before.

""Going back to the bare basics and borrowing from the closet of Crusader Kings, well done""

Pros:
-The vibe of the game.  What I mean by this is how I felt when I loaded up the game for the first time.  The game feels dark, gritty, tense.  Playing as the ERE, I adopted a death ground strategy and felt tense the whole time.  Good job.
-The feeling of impending doom.  It's subtle, much appreciated.  At first I was like, ""Where is Attilla? I don't see the Huns as that scary, what's going on here?""  You then realize (or remember) he was not born yet
-The unit balance feels good enough out of the box.  I say this because the inevitable mod or compilation will come by and fix it all anyways, but out of the box it was playable and I didn't feel like it was too arcade-y.
-the UI and ""Paradox""-like feel to it all.  Fellow fans of Paradox games and Crusader Kings will appreciate the intrigue, the family trees and other little bits that make up the generals and family tree(s).  Nice touch on actually assigning the family members as either generals or immobile governors, thanks for that.
-The Map.  This is a nice map.  Look at this map.  Look at this motherfucking map.  Love the medieval esque touch to the font and paper map look. well done.  Too bad the graphics look so... jagged.  Modern games need true SSAO, HDR and blah blah, good shadows and soft look to the whole deal to look nice.  It's all a trick to the eye, too much detail looks weird.
-The 2D Portraits.  Love it.  Simple change adds something ROME TW1 esque that is great.  Hated the 3d models in Rome2.  Maybe you can go back and remove them and add in some 2d portraits?
-The family member skill tree.  Awesome.  Feels good, like the HoMaM feel to it, or maybe Shogun TW.  RPGlike, well done.  ALso like the ancillaries and how we can choose them.
-The conclusion of battle.  Genius.  You can now END BATTLE anytime after winning.  Your end credits to a battle can be chasing down those damn German axemen. Good.


Cons:
-the graphics settings even on Max Quality look ugly.  No, before you say anything, or roll your eyes, or sigh, or facepalm... I have a good computer, it's not that that, so just sit down and ""don't even"". We want to enjoy the artwork you created, but it doesnt look very good right now and we all know it's the engine.  We all can tell you have talented art teams, so give them a new engine for Attilla's sake.
It's frustrating, the warscape engine is close to exploding.  Stop kicking it over and over, it's dead, ok? CA, with all that cash money, please for god sakes make a new engine and bedazzle us for the next TW game. Enough said.  Just do it already.
  
-The UNIT and FACTION names are soooooo vanilla, it's so terrible.  Surely you can hire a dude to get some historical names. Come on.  Hunnic levy.  GOD.  Stop it. Comitatenses, is enough don't put spears on the end! Ugly.  Latin and english looks lame together.  Same with adding Borderguards and the end of Limitanei. Don't. ok? Ugly and cringe worthy.  If the players don't know what that unit is, they will look it up and be glad you kept all the nomenclature correct.  I remember those historical descriptions ROME1 units had.  That was awesome. Why did you ever get rid of that kind of unit view window, anyways?

-Funny and Bad that you used the same voices and unit recognitions but then threw in Christian slants to it.  Like... ""Heaven can wait"" Instead of Hades.  Except that Hades is the greek Hell, so. Anyhow.  I would have hoped you would have gone the route you did in Napoleon where units and such had their native tongue.  It kicked ass and added that layer that was needed.  I think it's tough to figure out what a 5th century hunnic language would SOUND like, hey, I get that.  Could have tried? We all want to hear Latin and old Germanic, that's a no brainer.  Make a DLC for it, make us buy it.  Who cares.  Just no DLCs about women warriors, clowns, unicorns that shoot rainbows or stuff like that.  Keep the Hollywood weird shit out please. Thanks!

-Same Boring Elevator Music.  Would have thought you guys went Hollywood and given us an epic track with Hunnic/Eastern music.  It's there I guess, but it's boring.  It takes away from my feeling of the impending doom that will befall the innocent people of the ERE. Hire a composer and score your games properly, like the old days.  I still get chills when I hear the old Roman March theme from ROME1.

P.S. It's time to rekindle a relationship and get Jeff VanDyck back composing for you.  Or have him come back and rescore the game, make us pay for it in a DLC, whatever you gotta do.

Take note of the comments, listen to those drums and let the nostalgia flow.  Thanks for reading friends.

Or... do a good Medieval 3 that transitions well into renaissance/exploration age with maps and colonies to build like you have with the desolate regions after a burned/razed city.

88,14529081,english,"More to play before writing a complete review but so far if you're wondering what this 'expansion' is like here's some info. Creative Assembly is pumping out these and I'd almost call these mini expansions to Rome 2. Attila so far looks very much the same as Rome II, obviously a new setting though. So far it looks like they've improved on things, added more depth to politics. Is a little more complex. Shifted buttons around but it is very much just the Rome II game, muddled around with and improved. So far AI seems a bit better and not as much 'blobbing of units' going on in battles. Still much swarming ants style though, kind of a arcadey feel. The combat is essentially exactly the same as Rome 2, and not like Shogun 2. I preferred Shogun 2 style of combat definately. Swords clanging. Arrows felt like they were being drawn back and fired/lobbed and actually heard them fly, made an effect on each individual man within a unit. At the moment in this engine it just looks/feels/sounds like they're throwing lines of smoke at enemies that make no sound unless zoomed right in. That old engine is dead and done with, it was great for battle lines being held and individual fights going on, cool to watch but that engine had terrible performance. The Attila game runs very fast and well. It definately seems Creative assembly is going for a more arcadey feel like Rome 2 seemed (to me). I'm interested in the history of this Era and like it more so than the Rome era but, essentially I think this is going to be another cash cow for them with more mini exps like they did in Rome 2. They've done a good job of the Prologue(Tutorial) in this and I'm enjoying it.

92,14528174,english,"Good: Total War: ATTILA is one of the best entries to the Total War series yet, Creative Assembly has definitely picked up their act since the disaster/disgust that was Rome 2 and presented an authentic experience of the dying days of the Roman empire(s). Battles are greatly improved and almost on par with the first rome and barbarian invasion now, the camapign draws you in much more with more immersion, more features and greater replayability thanks to the dynamism of the migrating peoples that are the hordes and the steady climate change. The prologue campaign is engrossing, much more so then Rome 2's Etruscan one, I am still yet to finish it yet enjoying it so far even as a series veteran. 

Bad: Kinda bad performance at the moment, get some stutters, way lower FPS compared to Rome in general and big blobs fighting kills the FPS. This can be fixed by patching and driver updates from Nvidia so I'm not too fussed. Overall I feel like i got my moneys worth and would probably even buy the DLC at this rate if as much love is put into as the main campaign, as there are so many interesting dark age period conflicts that could be touched on by CA. (Muslim invasions, Saxon conquest of England, Charlemagne) 

Nutshell:
Good - Better then Rome 2, on par with the other great warscape games, Napoleon and Shogun 2.

This game is what that should have been, the little tweaks are much better and the AI is much better too. but they are essentilly just tweeks, I can't help feel it's a glorified dlc.. (especially coming out relatively soon after rome 2: sept. 2013).. at this point because the campaign map just doesn't have the grandour as most the other games. so this game for me is deserving of it's extra 5 metapoints over rome 2.

9,14515038,english,"This review, until I update it is based on first impressions of the first four hours. So bear that in mind.

Total War: Attila is the game Rome 2 should have been. That's a rather bold statement straight out the gate but it's definately an apt description. Immediately the game introduces you to a ton of new elements that either are returning favorites or brand new ideas. Everything has a much more in depth coat of paint to it and an apocalyptic dark ages feel. Make no mistake either, This is truly the Dark age being depicted here.  

The gameplay feels responsive, far more so than before, and there's a weight to every click and push. It's very punishing for stupid mistakes but rewards brilliance. The interface is somehow streamlined while being even more in depth. The unit cards have much more 'at a glance' descriptions of traits as compared to Rome 2's graph and stats clusterfuck of comparing making much easier to keep track of which units are good for what and why. The tech trees are also much more simplified as you can clearly see them spread out all in one big tree instead of the multiple pages you had to go through in rome 2. Returning from Previous games is the family tree system, it combines with the Rome 2 factions system to make politics much more in depth than ever before and much more engaging. the ability to assign governors and people into positions of power in your society also add much needed depth to the experience. The level up system is also dramatically improved for named characters back into a tree of abilities rather than simply going by the cards that didnt tell you what came after that in the tree without dragging back up the clunky encyclopedia every time. Overall, everything feels much more intelligently designed. 

As for optimization, lolwat? there's very very little of it. I found several bugs that were atrocious and hopefully will quickly be patched, driver issues mostly to be honest.
EDIT: As it turns out these optimization issues were mainly on my end as my drivers were outdated, once my drivers were properly updated it seems to be running fine

Visually the game is stunning, It's gorgeously presented, the detail is incredible and the whole thing is much more detailed and real looking. 
The AI is frustratingly unforgiving even on the easiest settings you'll be carefully managing your provinces and struggling for funds if you're playing as one of the smaller factions or the viking forefathers faction. The Diplomacy is extremely difficult as most factions refuse any proposals I have without even looking at them despite us being on good terms, Even the most reasonable of ones like trade it seems no one is interested in. As a result I find myself constantly strapped for cash to upgrade provinces, and buy more units which despite having a possibilty of fielding 8 armies according to my imperium I cannot even afford 2 full armies and this change is one I do not like. Perhaps it's intentional? But it feels like it's a crapshoot between trying to position your armies to predict your enemies movements. And the amount of movement range seems to be absurd on ships,forcing the pathfinding to take unnessecarily longer routes preventing you from reaching an enemy ship that should easily be in range giving them time to launch a sneak attack out of no where across a river within 2 turns of their last army being destroyed. Almost as if the AI is cheating to make the game feel more difficult and hectic, it definately works but as a result leaves me frustrated as cheap shot doomstacks come out of no where and lay siege to my towns

11,14526415,english,"$45 is very steep for this title, and origionally may be off-putting for many. Despite it's price tage, this game is extremely worth it. This game is what Rome 2 should have been it has its flaws which I will get to, but the many positives make this game a definite return to the quality of the total war series.

cons: This game does have performance issues. Cutscenes are laggy and will freeze. The turn cycle has crashed on multiple occasions. Yet this game has not yet been out for 24 hours at the time of writing this review, so it is very likely that these problems will not persist for much longer.

pros: DOMESTIC POLITICS AND FAMILY TREE ACTIONS! The addition of this feature not only makes the game exactly what fans of Rome 2 had wanted, but the manner that it is added means it is not only a fun side-feature like the domestic politics added in Imperial Edition; it is a crucial aspect of the campaign. Being able to see exactly how each family member relates to each-other and the exact actions that can be taken for each member is the perfect combination of the family features from Rome 1/Medieval 2 and Shogun 2 with several new features added.
The single player campaign is outstanding so far, I already am running multiple campaigns as the Sassanid, Ostragoths and a video series as the Geats. The dynamic enviroment and the flavor that Creative Assembly has given to the campaign world makes Total War: Attila one of the most enjoyable total war games in a very long time.

The price is very steep and heavy, but ultimately I feel that it is worth it. Total War: Attila is the game that fans of the series wanted Rome 2 to be. People are disappointed that this was treated as a stand alone rather than an expansion for Rome 2, but I feel that this game is the future of the Total War series, so many different elements in this game are perfected and refined into a game that just feels solid and right. I would even go so far as to say that people who are deciding between buying Rome 2: Imperial Editon or Total War: Attila should absolutley go for Attila.

13,14526027,english,"Let me start by saying that I have owned every single Total War game since the first shogun and have been playing these games since I was 10 years old. That being said, I think this is the freshest Total War game in a long while.  

The Ai is the smartest in the series thus far, it will flank, it will outmaneuver you on the campaign map and it will kick you around if you are not paying attention. The best part is that the AI will no longer sit by as you rain death upon them with ranged units (usually). It is still not perfect however, they will still do stupid things every once and a while, like build an army with 10 war dogs units or put their siege engine in a stupid place.  I have also noticed that for the first time ever, I have seen the AI take a lot of Mercenary units to flush out its ranks.  

Where this game really shines is in the sieges, they are beautiful. Fires destroy whole villages, smoke effects are top notch, and projectiles look incredible for the first time in series history.  The AI also shines here, using choke points and barricades to beat me up and keeping ranged units in just the right places to fire on me.  

I have always found myself becoming bored with the battles in other Total War games after about 40-50 turns and using auto-resolve whenever I didn't need to fight a close battle because they all started to blend together and loose the excitement. This has not been the case in Attila. Every fight feels fresh, each encounter I feel challenged, and I often found myself being emerged in the battles in a way I never had before.  There is a strange cinematic experience in Attila that has not been there since the first Shogun and Medieval, I am not sure if it is the AI, the graphics, or the sense of desperation in every move that gives it what so many of the recent games have been lacking but I am glad it's back and I hope it is here to stay.  

When you win that battle there are now several options for what to do with the newly taken settlement. Most talked about is the ability to destroy settlements, this removes them from the map and leaves a little marker where the settlement was. You will gain some cash from this as well as food.  Be warned however, rebuilding settlements is extremely expensive, a small lvl 2 town was going to cost me 13,000 cash and 600 soldiers to rebuild. One of the lesser publicized features is the ability to pillage settlements. This will damage all the buildings, and give you some cash but leave the city in the control of the other faction.  This is useful for when you send a small army (or navy!) to attack an unprotected settlement but don't have the army to fend off the attack yet. Then you have the pillage and settle option which is a combo of the settle and pillage actions, meaning you damage all the buildings and get a lot of cash but also settle the town. Last you have the regular settle and subjugate options. 

Winter is coming. Winter will kill men if you get caught without protection, the attrition is pretty steep and I love it. 

City management is improved here too, all city’s (villages, towns, ect.) can have a governor who will both act as a general if the city is invaded (using the garrison troops) as well as allow you to place edicts on individual towns.  This makes owning one piece of a region a lot more bearable, and doesn't force you to invade people just for that extra bonus.  

I am trying to keep myself from getting to excited from this game, I really do love it but I also don't want to seem too fanboyish. I am just extremely happy to have a very good Total War game for the first time in a while.  As of this moment I don't want to give a score of the game, I will save that for my first update after I have many more hours in game. I will say that if you are a fan of the series and you are worried about another Rome II, don't this is everything Rome II should have been.  

I will keep this review up to date for at least the next few weeks incase something crazy comes up and ruins the game.

I would love if Rome 2 had Attilas mechanics but we all know that is too late to make those types of changes.  Atleast please put more variety into atttila or It would be awesome but is impossible if they did an expansion around the year 100BC for this game. All the fans have been waitng for a game that actually works (Attila) and one that also includes tons of varietry (Rome 2). Once again I feel the cup is half full because attila lacks unit variety and factions. Starting in a small settlement and conquering the mediterranean was one of the coolest thing I could do. NOW IS NOT POSSIBLE. The starting roman faction already owns all the territories in italy, greece, spain and many other regions. Attila should of been a ROME 2 expansion if Rome 2 would of worked properly from day one, PLEASE make an expansion for attila that would allow for the conquering of the mediterranean. If you set it in the dark ages, after attila dies and before mediaeval starts, im sure the game could be fun.

The start positions for the nations are hordes are all interesting and offer a good opportunity for large range of options. The battles are interesting and the units are much more dependant on local superiority and quality rather than simply throwing them at one another. 

Now onto the bad. The Unit Rosters are thin, and the units themselves are quite bland. No more professional Legions for either the WRE (Wetern Roman Empire) or the ERE (Eastern Roman Empire) which is quite sad. Honestly they look like hired barbarians clad in chainmail with rough shields rather than professional soldiers, which I guess to a degree is accurate for the time period but those beautiful Legions will be missed.

I have 5 battles at one settlement with the same army, each battle wore my men down, but they kept coming. The only advantage I had was the topography of the settlement, high up with narrow passages.

I defeated the first 4 waves by forcing the enemy into a narrow pass ""think 300"" and using my cavalry to keep their ranged units on the run.

My 2000 strong army was able to defeat about 9000 units before the 5th wave overwhelmed me.

I felt a sense of great loss when my leader a 5 star general was killed. This game really draws you in and makes you think carefully about your decisions.

What you do in battle and how you do it is a major factor, not just who has the most units wins.

The landscape and unit usage is very important.

The family tree is a welcomed change that makes it both useful and entertaining. I have never seen so many Bastards in my life.

Towers are god-weapons for cities, able to shoot halfway across a town with an extremely high RoF. (I lost 500 soldiers in 1 seige, 450 were due to towers).

That said, there is no real 'overpowered' faction, like there was in Rome II (Rome).  I've been testing armies against each other, all die equally as fast.  The fire idea is nice.   Family tree is fun, if not a little complicated.  Slow campaign start for most factions.  Definitely alot of new aspects with the introduction of the horde/migration system.

The campaign is much more in-depth, and has many wonderful features restored like Family Trees and a deeper political system.

46,14511698,english,"****UPDATE**** (new review)

Ok, I've gotten a chance to sink my teeth into the campaign. Let me say, WOW. I can't tell you how many times I said to myself, ""why couldn't ROME 2 be like this""

PROS
-------------------------------

-- Character management-- It reminds me of how the older Total War games did characters but couldn't quite make it work. Now it feels right and works better. Now you can equip your generals with specific items, even attach other characters to more notable ones adding more depth to ""building"" your characters. 

-- City Governors --  I can't tell you how annoyed I was that if I wanted to have a character manage a city, I had to waste one of my valuable army slots for it. Now you can just assign a character as a governor and they'll manage it, earn XP, all the goodies, all without having to use up an army slot.

-- Beach Assault --  A great idea in Rome 2, a perfected dream in Attila. I was playing one of the Norse factions and was like, ""I don't care if beach assaults suck, I'm a freaking Viking, I'm attacking from the sea"". When I got to the map I was amazed at how much beach I had to land on. No longer was I hard up for good landing zones. Also the beaches look amazing, very realistic.

-- RTS Gameplay -- I can't quite put my finger on it, it just feels better, in almost every way. It’s almost like I traded in my terrycloth bathrobe for a velvet one. They both worked, it’s just the velvet one feels nicer.

-- Settlement battles --  The buildings look SO MUCH better, the settlements look like what you'd expect from people who have been living there improving on them for years. On top of that, they're more intuitive to defend, and there is more of a variety. So when you take the variety, the look, and how more realistic they feel, I actually enjoy sacking/defending settlements. 

-- Occupying Settlements-- When I took my first town the game presented me with a nice list of options. No longer am I stuck with just ""occupy/raze/the other one"" There was like 6 options I could choose from, each had its own distinct advantages and disadvantages.

-- Family/Political Management --  Where to begin, I find myself spending more time managing my family than ever before. I actually feel like I'm ""grooming"" certain characters now. As they gain ranks they can be given positions in the government/tribe/gang. Each position brings its own bonuses to the character. Marriage is now more interesting, I suddenly now understand why all those high society folks in Jane Austin books where so obsessed with marrying the right person. The right marriage can bring a lot of bonuses to your family.

-- The Interface -- It took me a little bit to get used to the new set up (not really that much different), but you can tell CA took great care to make everything flow better. Some screens can be toggled a bit more than they were in Rome 2.

-- Unit Cards --  Really, I wasn't all that butt hurt about the unit cards in Rome 2, at first I was like, ""what????"" but it didn't take me long to get used to them. I bounced back and forth between all the mods for unit cards, and ultimately I just stuck with the CA ones. Now the new unit cards are more in line with how so many people wanted.

-- Performance -- I have had zero issues with performance. My settings are on as high as they can the game will let me and I have not had any issues. 

-- Not a Rome 2 clone -- This isn't really an issue for me, but may be for some. Attila is not Rome 2 reskinned or a glorified expansion pack. There is enough of a different to tell these two games are different. Attila feels very different from Rome 2, and even though I LOVE Rome 2, I am very much enjoying Attila.



CONS
---------------------------------------------------

-- Unit Banners -- I know I can turn them off, even set them to ""mouse over"", but they just feel weird to me. Note I am talking purely about aesthetics. I think they're a nice improvment as far as functionality (they display a bit more info for those quick glances when in the heat of battle)

-- Unit marker/indicator Arrow thingy -- When you move a unit or hold down the space bar it'll show you where the unit is supposed to go, well, they look kind of ugly, and distracting for some reason. Not a deal breaker, just something I wish I could change in the settings.




CONCLUTION
___________________________________________

This is a much more polished game when compared to Rome 2. Its launch has been very smooth and has been nowhere near as rocky as Rome 2 was. Don't get me wrong, I love me some Rome 2, but I could totally understand people’s frustrations’ during its launch.

When people say ""this is what Rome 2 should've been"", I go back and forth on my reaction. While I totally find myself wishing Rome 2 had all new features Attila does, I realize that they are two different games. To say this is what Rome 2 should've been would be like saying ""Rome 2 is what Rome 1 should've been"". There is enough of a gap to differentiate the two. 

Most importantly, seeing the equipment features for characters, as well as many other improvements, I can begin feel better about Warhammer Total War. With each Total War game everything gets better and better. Attila is just one more step closer to a perfected Grand Strategy game.




**** OLD REVIEW *****
Just from the Prologue the game runs very smooth. I have no frame rate issues, very pretty. No issues like Rome 2. 

The units feel more medieval, at one point I was like ""Medieval 3 is going to be amazing"" (after Warhammer!!!!!!! *crosses fingers*)

The city management is MUCH better. I wasn't too butt hurt how Rome 2 did it, but this feels better.

The game grabs you for sure, more imerssive.

Also, I can see little hints of how Warhammer Total War is going to play, I'm very happy with this.",1424165040,1424221715,True,260,7,0.860067486763000488,14,True,False,False,76561197971857790,591,27,12070,0,155,1583096687,,

After a first day of playing I can now add to this review.

My first impression still hold. The game is what Rome 2 should have been. Some wird freezing happens on the campaign map here and there but the game has not yet crashed on me. Everything seems to work smooth. I hope that same improvements have carried out to the coop side too because Rome 2 is still a  game that constantly fails on coop.

So far everything looks very very well tought out. The familytree is back wich is exellent. I have no understanding why it was ever taken away in the first place.
All the poltics and powerplay inside my own faction is interesting and I actually pay attention to it when making decicions. Also the foreign poltics play a healthy role in my campaign so far.
I have not much allies or tradepartners so I ceep good care for those that are.

Some of the things I dont like are first the different funit flags. Expacially the ones that are in the campaign map are just plain terrible. I had to play long time until I learned to read the usefull and much needed info from them.
The unitflags in the battlemap aren't much better. There's more info but it's difficult to read at first.

I'm assuming most of you reading this have played empire total war and are famliar with that story. Its basically the same thing that napoleon total war did for empire which was fix a good game and make it a great one. Atilla is a game that CA definietly got right on the first try without any patchs having to come in. So far i've had no issues except with pathing my units in cities ( which is super fucking annoying and has fucked me over more than a few times ) and some clipping with units in grassy maps which doesn't really effect anything gameplay wise. 

Anyway lets talk about the important things that Atilla has to offer that Rome II didn't. FIrst and formost the new flame mechanic is really fun and adds a whole new layer to the game. No more piking up entrances to cities or camping in a single spot as the flames from siege equipment will burn buildings and areas in the city forcing units to move. Another new mechanic horde mode is pretty fun if your a migratory faction but it's also pretty scary because your armys and cities move as one so if you lose an army you lose a whole city as well.

Additionally Atilla makes the real time battles a lot more interesting as cheap units don't just fall over or shatter instantly. This makes battles last much longer and gives you more time to flank around or shore up battle lines. Even better is that units will now come back from routing if you manage to stablize your lines further increasing the battle time and stratagy involved. 

FInally is Atilla worth $45? I'd definetly say yes to that question. Its a great total war game to get into if you havn't played one yet or if your a returning player. It comes with a ton of improvements to Rome II and any of the small issues that it has now such as the ones I mentioned will surely be fixed quickly in one of CA's patchs.

My first impressions:
The negative point would be that most units kinda look the same on the battlefield, and running the game has obiously become more difficult with older computers.
The real postive stuff is the new campaign wich is different to all other total wars. It's really focused on razing, looting, burning your way through Europe. The emphasis on war and destruction is definitely omnipresent and that's great. 
I'm currently having a campaign with the crumbling Western Roman Empire and keeping it together, even in normal difficulty, proves to be quiete challeging.

97,14520041,english,"I plan on writing an extensive review later on as I play more, but for the short amount of time I've put into this thus far, this is some of the features that I thought stood out in comparison to Total War: Rome II...

1. Just by the main menu theme alone, I personally find the soundtrack of Attila: Total War to be much more captivating and grativiting than its predecessor. The music fits the Dark Ages of Europe almost perfectly, fitting with the theme that no matter which faction you play as, the flood of death and destruction that is The Huns will slowly and in full force make its way to your borders. I found that while playing the campaign, this style of music makes the atmosphere of the world almost apocolyptic, giving you the feeling of vulnerability throughtout your playthrough. 

2. Since a long time, I am beggining to feel attached to characters in the game again. This is accomplished thanks to the new immersive family tree and political system the good folks at Creative Assembly added into the game. With this new system, you now take the time ( for as long as it takes) to advance and steel key positions within your kingdom or empire. Putting characters in different positions within your politcal structure now grant rewarding bonuses to either your army or regions in the game, rewards that I find many players will take the effort to gain. 

Basically the attachment players may get to certain characters is the combined result of the time players will use to advance charcters they wish to see get ahead in the world. Seeing an heir whom you've molded through various political actions, military conquests and family shapings became king later on is rather satidfying. 

3. Sieges in Total War: Attila are much more immersive and chaotic than from any other Total War game ever made. This is in due part to the ""end of the world"" scenario making a big theme in this game, but having settlements degrade after prolonged sieges and set a fire, having rotted corpses littered around the base of the walls and having siege barristers battered and broken at the attackers deployment zone is indeed a site one will not get tired of anytime soon.

Added, causing fire storms in city settlements is something I look foward to do now just for the visual awes, even if it means me having to pay for it later on (plus it gives demoralising effects to the defenders).

Overall, I was greatly impressed by what Total War: Attila offered me in my short time playing, I would play all day if I could, but unfortuntaly I have an exam I need to study for (in Roman history ironically).

Despite some bugs I saw (jittering soliders, stagnant AI campaign armies), I look foward to playing this again real soon and hope that I can put up a more detailed review on this game.",1424206343,1424206343,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,76561198006637372,197,2,15524,0,1270,1504128634,,

2,14519825,english,"Definetly a huge improvement on rome 2. Both the campaign map and the battle map color scemes are far better, making the terrain more realistic and crisp looking. The AI is also definetly improved, as when I was in battle, the huns act different and attack different than the Goths, and so on for all the factions. Also, viking factions seem to go more for a naval army, and inland germanic factions go for a lot of land, so the campaign AI is balanced to adapt to it's surroundings, where ever that may be. I also must say the music is a good improvment, as rome 2's music seemed boring at times, Attila's music is definetly adding to the overall immersion of the game.

I have, however found some early bugs and overlooked details, such as in some battles (mainly siege battles) the AI units get caught on an invisible barrier, or they all want to go stand on exactly the same spot, creating circular groups of bodies that won't stop running towards the center of the blob, until attacked. On one occasion, even, my units got caught on an invisible barrier, and attempted to go around it by trying to walk into the sea? Another topic I would like to bring to attention is in siege battles, if you attack by land and the AI has a mix of land and naval units, it can choose to not disembark its artillery or archers, so in minor settlements even if you wipe out the entire enemy force, you can't win the battle because of a few boats just sitting off shore, out of ammo and useless. These are all minor bugs, and I know they will be fixed, probably within the first patch, so I don't let them feel too immersion breaking.

It's still good regardless, I just had higher hopes for new character models and sounds.  I'm glad they brought back the family tree and added a bunch of options to it.

This game is much improved over Rome II, its what Rome II should have been in everyway, the only thing is that you need a strong rig to run it, if you play around with the graphical settings you can keep a stable framerate, in Rome II the framerate would randomly, dramaticly drop for no apparent reason, here it seems as if its been sorted out.  If you have problems running Rome II, I would reccoment lowering army unit size, it helps a lot.

43,14517318,english,"When I bought Rome 2 pre-order I was very hopefull because of Shogun 2, however like many others my hopes and expectations were dashed on release date. I couldn't even play it first day literally, and even when I could there was some massive bugs/glitches/crashes during game, especially in the real time battles where I faced extraordinary lag if the armies were too big (was not my graphics cards fault). 

When I originally heard that Rome Atilla was in development and going to be released in early 2015, not only was I surprised because it seemed so soon since Rome 2 total war came out, I was also highly skeptical. I was clearly expecting some serious problems in game, since it just seemed to have been another rushed game for a quick cash grab. And I remember what happened during my Rome 2 TW pre-order, so logically I knew I shouldn't chance buying another pre-order. However I am a firm Total War fanboy, I've played it since the very first. So asking me not to buy Rome Atilla pre-order was like asking a Star Wars geek not to buy the Star Wars original trilogy; it just wasn't going to happen that I not buy Atilla. 

I get in game, no problems, I select campaign, no problems, I play a real time battle, no problems. A pleasant surprise. The game is really good, although even though its not comparable to Shogun 2 of course, it is a significant improvement from Rome 2. I am currently playing as the Western Roman Empire and as I expected it is difficult. I am being bombarded by massive Viking forces in Britannia, and I am staving off the Alans, the Vandals and the Ostrogoths in the Balkan regions. The AI has improved somewhat I think, they're a bit more agressive on the campaign map, but not that much, and in real game battles, well... they haven't done anything incredibly retarded during my first campaign as of yet so that's something, will see if that continues. 

If I didn't have to go to school (late) I wouldn't stop at 5 hours, I'd probably go for around a 10 hour window, approximately. Possibly more.

1) Much more sophisticated campaign, with much more depth, dynamism and interesting twists
2) Much better city development, an excellent nomadic system
3) Siege battles are much, much more enjoyable now, land battles as well
4) The family and politics tree is a significant improvement over Rome 2
5) The map is ample, and more land battles are likely to occur now... further added to by the damage that city battles do permanently to the settlement
6) A real challenge economically and diplomatically... you feel like just when you are scrapping by things are about to get significantly worse
7) Battles are not as over-speeded as I thought, they are fast but enjoyable and controlable even for a 30-something old grognard like me
8) Functionally the UI is an improvement of both depth and accessibility
9) Campaign AI seems better
10) No major bugs to report! Only very very minor ones you barely notice... pathfinding has been fixed, battles don't bother me as much as they did in Rome 2

CONS:

1) Again, very little unit character and variety. This period was insanelly interesting with countless Foederati, types of infantry and cavalry and other unit types being tried and adopted or forgotten in battles... I feel CA really misses the boat here
2) The UI looks ugly - colours blend in and its hard to see things clearly because of it. For a game that is supposed to manage detail this could be better
3) Unit cards are horendous, they looks like Medieval Total War 2 quality
4) Unit diversity again, sorry for mentioning it twice but I am dissapointed
5) The military build progression through technology is over balanced, this further hurts variety

80,14514977,english,"So far so good.  I wouldn't sell it as anything more than Rome II.V - those waiting for a *complete* revision to the status quo are probably better off waiting for the next installment (likely Medieval 3).

Most of the revisions seem centered around the civil aspects of the game.  This is a possible bias, as I felt Rome II's civil aspect was unusually shallow, and disappointing.  But now, the faction menu is more than a feeble reference to arbitrary information - you'll be visiting it a lot, as it's now relevant on a changing basis and beneficial.

The graphics are improved marginally, but I will say that the lack of blood effects reeks helplessly of some pocket-change DLC close on the horizon.  I'm kind of irritated at this recurring Parental Setting For Sale that Creative came up with but, at least it's cheap.  Shoulda had it ready for launch.  A quick couple of peeks through the graphic settings didn't show a [ ]Gore option, forgive me if it's actually there but buried in some unlikely menu. (In one Faction's starting cinematic it's hilariously absent, and a Roman Statesman looks like he's just playing along like a good sport while he gets stage-stabbed.)

Siegecraft remains pretty similar, as do battles.  The stances are back again, with only a couple little changes.  (Pre-battle resource management has been touched up and clarified, making your ""Fortify"" stance make more sense.)  I'm happy to see new maps and not just reskinned ones.  They still emphasize choke points, and logistics.

The only thing I haven't tried in earnest is possibly the game's most characterized addition; Migrating.  You evidently turn your city into a roving horde and inundate some other territory that you like better.  This is a likely mechanic for a game set in the Great Migrations era (or at least just before it) but again, I haven't actually tried the mechanic yet.

As a last note, research is nearly identical to its former self, which has never felt spot-on to me in the TW series, but it's serviceable.  For the most part, I'm relieved there isn't some ridiculous hidden Food mechanic just waiting to kick my knees in and make me crawl through the campaign.  Food is still there, but it's handled better.

For newcomers: Total War is a franchise that deals with a familiar Risk-like campaign map, but whose battles take place on a battle map with live strategy elements.

Pros:
-The UI is a nice change, making everything easier to access and in a nice compact area
-The unit card changes, This is a personal opinion any way you look at it but I like the more realistic unit cards over the cartoony ones
-Dynamic fire is absolutely beautiful. It was a blast to watch trees and buildings get set on fire when archers would rain down upon my enemies
-Family trees are finally something i'm interested in using now, and the UI for the family tree is really simple and easy to understand, placing family members in cities makes it so you can issue edicts in those provinces.
-The technology tree displays what comes next down the line much like in Rome II but with a nicer design.
-General skills/traits is similar to Shogun 2's in which it shows what comes next down the line so you can plan out how you want your badass general to be.
-Siege battles are tonnes of fun in Attila, the longer you siege a city the more damage the structures and walls take, making it easier to siege and gives a morale penalty to the defender.
-Theres a fantastic new waypoint system that makes it WAY easier to flank without having to worry about babysitting all of your troops at the same time.
-The new unit icons, instead of flags they have 'tiles' above the units, I wasn't sure if this was good or bad, it certainly makes it cleaner and more compact, its another thing up for personal opinion I guess.
-Generals have much more of an impact in Attila, your general being alive or dead is a huge thing in battles, if your general dies early on it's pretty much GG unless you have deciplined troops.


Cons:
-Cavalry doesn't seem to charge units that are running away very well. They stop as soon as they hit a unit.
-Even though sieges are fun as hell, the AI still doesn't seem to be able to handle it, I almost held off 1500 units with my general and a unit of javlinmen.
-Loading times for battles seem to be quite long
-I got some freezes at the start of my turn, only lasting about 5-7 seconds though
-I was having problems with slowmo in battles, though I rarely use it the units seem to stutter when they run in slowmo
-I'm not sure if this is intentional, but when my general is in shield wall, he literally cannot die to arrows, I had 3 units of archers unloading into my general until they ran empty, and he only lost 2 guys, out of 56. If thats intentional I think it should be changed.




Bit of Backstory:

So far I did a little of the prologue and decided to start my first grand campaign as the Jutes (Might aswell considering they came free with the preorder).

In the first 3 hours I only really came up against one small bug, which happend to be during a siege Some of my men got stuck under one of the ladders I setup against the wall. Other then that I haven't come across any game breaking bugs so thank god.

In my campaign as the Jutes in the first 10 turns I managed to piss of the Angles, making them march into my territory and take my only city, because god damn their army was huge. They took it from me and razed the land, which has a FANTASTIC animation by the way. They burned all the land and my city which makes it hard to grow food and restabalize as a faction, which meant I spent the next 20 turns just trying to get my damn public order and food back to the way it was at the start. So yay me :)

By the time Attila was born (awesome cinematic when that happens btw), I found myself still stuck in my first city because the Angles had two massive armies sitting outside my city in forify, and i could get troops because no money and all my buildings were gone from the raze earlier. So the AI has improved from Rome II (or maybe im just bad).

I eventually got out and started wrecking havoc, because its Total War after all.

If theres one thing i have to say about this game its that it can be very challenging at points, especially when noone wants to be your ally and your at war with pretty much all your neighbours (woops)

Thats pretty much it, if I played a bit more before writing this I would have a lot more to say but I wanted to get this out there for the people what weren't sure if they should buy it or not

TL;DR It's fantastic you should definately pick it up, for $45 its worth it!

Battles are much more chaotic compared to Rome II EE... And not in a good way. You cant understand which unit hits which unit... People just suddenly die for no apparent reason. I used to play Rome II with the Radious mod. And I realize this one needs such a mod as well. You cant simply understand what happens in combat.  

Animations are terrible. Arrow animations suck. Who hits what? And Viking Berserker animations. OMG... Berserkers attack with their arms and shields raised above their heads... They hit the enemy with their tummies. Animations are not smooth. Animation switches are not continous. A unit may instantly change one animation to another.  

Combat physics are also bad. Units are like stones. The may suddenly move like 5-10 feets with a sword attack. Again battles look really stupid. You feel like you are playing Age of Empires rather than a Total War game. 

Somehow your siege weapons refuse to attack your selected targets if they are on fire at will mode.  

To sum up cinematic aspect of the game is simply broken. Though the rock, paper, scissors type game play seems good. Unless you zoom in close to see whats happening, you can actually have some fun with battles.

I would say dont buy this one yet. I've been playing the game for the last 3 hours. Stick with Rome II: Emperor Edition with Radious Mod. Its a much better game.

 So far ive experienced absolutely no lag spikes, unlike the release of Rome 2. Combat and unit creation is also improved, although enemy A.I from what ive seen can still be improved on ""enemy cavalry mindlessely running into spearmen etc"".
