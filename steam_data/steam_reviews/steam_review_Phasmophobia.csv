After the tutorial and a couple of houses....I don't know that I can do VR.  This game is scary.  I had constant chills and goosebumps.  My throat hurts from screaming.  I'm probably never sleeping again.  Every single time I started to get used to the pace, and relax and think ""It's not so scary.  This isn't so bad.""  Something would happen to up the ante and make me scream in terror. This game is horrifyingly scary, and fun.  The tutorial is a bit lacking, so it helps to have a friend who's got some experience to teach you the ropes and has gear.  

Overall, I'm very excited to see future updates and improvements to the game.  It is extremely fun so far, with less than two hours in, this is my initial impression of the game. 15/10 would recommend.  Best played with friends.

• The ambience is awesome
• The background sound is agonizing
• Tasks that leave you with real fear of going to do

It combines all this with the citizen's inability to run, the affliction
and the desperation to not die multiply in 10 times

Not to mention that the icing on the cake in this game are friends who can barely make it
enter the seats and send you to the front line to take a picture, talk to
the ghost and die

the voice system is very brilliant, the people in my house were even frightened by
the screams and calls to summon the ghosts

Please don't take my negative review as meaning that this is a bad game because it is great fun even with the issues I noticed.

It is a great concept with some great game mechanics.
I like the voice recognition, the way ghosts hunt after you, the map layouts are all pretty good, and it's loads of fun to play with friends

I do feel like the cons, however, are pretty glaring.
Movement speed is WAY too slow. You can sneak in most other games faster than you can ""sprint"" in this game. I feel like it needs to be at least doubled.
The push-to-talk only sometimes works and the Spirit Box glitches out too frequently.
The pathing of the ghosts seems a bit odd. I ended up getting a wraith trapped in a closet.
I feel like there should be some way to interact with the map while you are dead, like moving objects or making sounds.

I know this is still in early access, so I'm hoping the developer looks at reviews and gameplay to see what can be fixed and improved.",1601871259,1601871259,FALSE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,205,10,402,402,402,1601786944,,

This game is very scary, and that's coming from the guy who heroically got through the entire intro of RE7 before turning it off forever and crying myself to sleep. 

I can only play this game with friends. 

The voice recondition is really cool, but the ghost voices don't really sound ""Ghostly"". They mainly sound like placeholder voices, probably to be replaced with better ones once the game comes out of early access. At least I hope so. 

Lights turn off by themselves, doors open and shut, raidos turn on, TV's turn on. You can hear footsteps from the floor above you. Everything is super dark unless you have a flashlight. The ghost designs are really creepy. The walking animation of them leaves a lot to be desired though. The death animation needs some variety too. There's also some tricks you'll need to learn in order to progress successfully. This game would probably be way more scarier in VR, but I don't think I could handle that myself. 

Overall, pretty solid game for spooktober, I will surely keep playing it till full release. (As long as my friends can carry my crying body back to the truck so I can huddle in the fetal position and suckle on my thumb while I whisper to myself: Ghosties arent real, Ghosties arent real)

Whenever you go hunting in game it takes like 5mins for ghosts to do anything.

ALSO when you die there's nothing for you to fucking do. Like there's no second chance to come back... no option bring your teammates back to life method.. or a fucking defibrillator to use.
Sometimes when you use a crucifix it doesnt fucking work or when you take pictures with the camera they dont capture the ghost but it checks off the task in your objectives task.

First off, I haven't played with friends yet, and I also am too poor to get a VR headset, so I play in desktop mode alone mostly. Now that that's out of the way, let's talk about the game:

This is probably the scariest horror game I have ever played, while still managing to be fun. A lot of games try to be both, but fail. If you play FnaF, you're in it for the scares, but it isn't much fun. If you play a multiplayer horror game like Dead by Daylight, it's really fun, but it isn't scary. This game found a great balance, between making it terrifying and fun!

While the game is good alone, it's much better with friends. Working together to find out the ghost and determine their class with friends is quite fun. I highly recommend playing with people who have similar hours to you, however, so you will be as competent as each other.


The goal of the game is to find 3 pieces of evidence to determine what type of ghost is haunting the home. You have a few pieces of equipment to use, and can get more from the in game shop with the money you earn from successful investigations. You can also get money by taking pictures of the ghosts and doing optional objectives. There are currently 12 ghosts in the game, each with their own set of 3 pieces of evidence. Seems easy, right? Well, here's where the horror comes in.

The longer you stay in the game, the more sanity you lose. Lose too much, and the ghost will go into attack phase. Each ghost has their own strength and weakness, however all of them are able to kill you. The only way to survive is to run and hide until the ghost calms down. While the jumpscare itself isn't awful, the psychological horror is off the charts, especially when you're hiding in a bathroom praying the ghost leaves you alone.

One more thing as well: The game uses your microphone. A lot. This includes communicating with your team, but also with the ghost. Some ghosts can talk back with the spirit box, but some cannot. The lynchpin in this, however, is that the ghost can hear you. If you're hiding in a closet and telling your friends how scared you are, the ghost will find you and you will die. You have to remain quiet and remain calm the whole time, or else it's game over.

Overall, this game is great. I'm excited to follow it's development, and if I can get myself to play it more, I'm excited to see what the game has to offer, but it is very difficult to be brave enough to boot this thing up.

74,Phasmophobia,76974555,english,"After about 12 hours of this game, I've got to say, I'm impressed. I've tried the VR and the regular keyboard and mouse versions, and there both pretty solid. The VR version could be worked upon of, and I have some ideas that I think could be pretty cool in the final version of the game, but I'll get into that later. Phasmophobia drops you into a haunted house for you, the player, to figure out what kind of ghost you're dealing with. You have multiple tools to work with, only some locked by some questionable level system. You'll be using EMFs, motion sensors, photo cameras, etc...... One major feature of this game is the proximity chat, and the voice recognition. I'm not joking when I say this, but the voice chat in this game is amazing. It's incredible how they managed to make the sound quality of other players equal to, if not better than discords sound quality. But the really sad part of it is that the voice recognition doesn't really work as well. It does work sometimes, but sometimes when you're trying to talk to the ghost using a Oujia board, it doesn't really pick up. On the horror part of this game, it can be terrifying. When you're EMF starts going off to a level 5, or you're heart starts beating really fast, you know you're in trouble, and you start to panic and thoughts start rushing to you, ""should i risk my life to get a picture for evidence? Or should I run away and see if I can survive just a little longer?"" Let's just say it gets VERY stressful. Another really fun thing is too, there are multiple different types of ghosts, like Demons, Oni's, Spirits, Revenants, etc...... All in All, I've had a lot of fun playing this game with my friends and I recommend this to it's fullest, and is probably my favorite horror game of 2020, so this is going to be a solid

The detective work on figuring out the ghost haunting the location has been fun but tough. Sometimes you don't get definitive proof or your guesses are wrong even tho you did get some proof you thought was correct.

The only issues I've had with the game so far are sometimes when loading out of a session, the screen goes black and doesn't load, so I have to alt-f4 and restart the game. Also, the in-game voice channels/spirit box doesn't always register. 

Otherwise this game has been a complete blast with friends. I'm not brave enough to ghost hunt alone. =D I highly recommend it to everyone, even those who don't like spooky games.

22,Phasmophobia,77054862,english,"Pasmophobia is a paranormal horror coop, and it does everything it should do. The atmosphere is immediate upon entering each premise on every map.

Proximity chat, as well as radio communication creates a lot of the immersion, although buggy at times where even passing the test before going into a map, people around you may not be able to hear you. So make sure you mute/deafen discord while you play for the best experience.

There is a wide variety of ghosts to encounter, and this game promotes exploration. Replaying maps doesn't feel like a chore because there's always something different happening in the map, as well as in different areas of it.

The tools needed for each encounter are essential to your success, and are intertwined to the objectives, so you never have problems bringing the right tool(s) for the job. Just make sure the cash cow that just so happens to splurge on equipment for the team doesn't die...

Economy is about what I expected it to be, you get more money from guessing the correct ghost/demon. And you get a little treat for doing all of the objectives. They give you more of an incentive to go back into an activity 10 building, god help you need to do something that gets you right infront of the spirit.

Overall a good game, my only issues are the actual character models of the spirits. Yurei, or Oni having the same cliche looking zombie models somewhat cut off the immersion.

Things i wish i knew when i started the game: 
- Ghost orbs usually appear outside of the room where the ghost is, this has made me lose a lot of games until i figured it out
- EMF doesn't give level 5 reading unless its directly in front of whatever the ghost touched.
- Ouija boards swallow your sanity, only use them whenever you're desperate for evidence, and even then they're RNG (they can spawn in closets and lockers, check everything you can open)
- Too many sound sensors in the same spot can overload the sensor mapping and not give you exact readings, but more of a general direction, maybe its a bug idk i hope they fix it though
- Wraiths can have footstep sounds (probably a bug right now)
- An attack and hunting isn't the same thing, if the ghost appears in front of you without the lights flickering, it's only attacking you, you can easily run away from it, or in most cases he'll disappear without touching you. Hunting is completely different
- The ghost AI's are dumb in hunting mode, you can easily hide behind something and play peeakaboo with the ghost and it wont attack you unless you make noise",1601859163,1601859163,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,28,2,2799,2800,2385,1602036913,,

Cons:
1.) sometimes the necessary evidence doesnt show up at all thus leading to certain objectives failing.
2.) Even more terrifying while stoned on sugar cookies.

Theres 12 ghosts, and about 8  different areas varying in sizes. and the ghost seems to be able to haunt any room in any of the buildings.

9,Phasmophobia,77052133,english,"[VR-less Review]
One of the more promising Early Access titles. Gather a team of 4 and witness the most horrifying thing this game has to offer; broken backs. Starting off, you're given no more than the basics of ghost hunting. Spirit boxes to communicate, UV lights to find finger prints or hand prints around the environment, flashlights to see your surroundings, EMF readers to detect ghost readings, video cameras to keep track of your pals and catch spirit orbs, a journal for the ghost to write in, and a regular picture camera to keep track of evidence, i.e the ghost, ouija boards, dead bodies and prints for extra cash. That cash can turn into a staggering amount of equipment, too. Parabolic microphones, candles, smudge sticks, crucifixes, motion sensors, sound sensors, head mounted cameras, thermometers, glowsticks, salt, you name it. 

The game plays slowly. At the start on easier difficulties, the ghost is typically tame, and the house is dark. You'll travel room to room finding clues. Is the room cold? Can you see your breath? Is there noises? Running sinks, creaking, voices, doors opening and closing? They're all clues to which room is haunted, and after that you're running into checkboxes. Is there ghost writing, are they communicating through the spirit box, fingerprints, you get the idea. Looking through and writing in your journal will help you decide what ghost it is. Revenant, Mare, Spirit, Oni, Shade, Wraith, Demon, all with different characteristics and weaknesses. 

The games atmosphere is surprisingly top notch [if you're not staring at your friends] and the maps feel fair, mostly. If you're not splitting up, it can be tough to find the room fast enough before the ghost enrages and start to hunt. If you get caught, you'll die and lose all equipment you brought with you. My complaints on the game are little and I'm hoping they'll be fixed in later updates, as in some equipment don't seem to work properly, lots of voice recognition issues [friends and I don't speak until we're all fully loaded so proximity and radio chat works], some ghosts seem to be tied to certain difficulties [citation needed], personally feel like the game shouldn't have a sprint button and the sprint should be the new walk.

It's a breath of fresh air that I'm sure not a lot of people have seen. It's terrifying, enjoyable, and might be the best <15$ you can spend on Steam, especially with friends. Lots of content to already be had and with more on the way, the future is bright and I can't wait to experience it in a great, cooperative horror game.",1601855253,1601856301,TRUE,3,1,0.571734488,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,521,2,1096,1096,591,1602036885,,

[h1][b]-Good-[/b][/h1]
-A fun and scary experience overall - especially with friends
-In-game voice chat and radio communication (would be nice for a voice chat volume boost to hear other people better)
-Great graphics and lighting, although some lighting and shadows do need improving
-Communication with the ghost and being able to say key words is a brilliant touch
-Sanity is a great feature
-Large amount of equipment to buy and use at your disposal
-Levelling up system which allows you to get more advanced and better equipment
-No microtransactions
-Maps are well designed
-No performance issues

[h1][b]-Bad/suggestions-[/b][/h1]
-Animations are very basic at the moment, but I'm sure they will improve later
-Walking and 'sprinting' speed is quite slow. You do get used to it, but I would like it to be a normal speed because sprinting feels slow motion, especially when looking at other players.
-Small amount of maps - looking forward to more.
-Same ambient atmosphere sound in every location. Hoping for different ones on each map.
-No object name when looking at items - when you purchase new items it's difficult trying to figure out which items is which in the van, especially when you have a lot of equipment loaded.
-Lack of spooky ghost sounds and scare tactics - so there are occasions where a ghost will make scary sounds etc. I think there's a lot of opportunity for spooktacular sounds such as knocking on the walls, writing on the wall, dragging dead bodies around etc. I know this game is in early access and its early days, but I think adding that in future will make it more fun and interesting.
-No workshop at this time, again I know it's early access but being able to have mods in this game would be amazing.
-Can't join friends through Steam, you have to use a code that they give when creating a lobby
-Objectives lack variety, looking forward to more of them in future.
-More ghosts and player models needed",1601855738,1601855973,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,464,113,351,351,351,1601769435,,

33,Phasmophobia,77052214,english,"This game is nothing but fantastic. 

I've always wanted a game like this, especially in vr, a real paranormal activity set game. 

I've asked so many of my friends to buy this game just so i can see their reactions. Its just a really fun game and is so much better with friends. You can hide behind them, talk to them to destress, or even get advice on what to do. That and having one of them sit in the truck outside watching the screens is just the best strat.

Its so fun and so exciting, and super scary like holy cow i get goosebumps every time i walk out of the building. That and whenever you loose your friends and get lost its the worst feeling in the world, its scary as hell. 

The ambience is perfect and only complements the creatures and idea of getting lost, with the creaking wood and thumping footsteps laid out by the creepy spirits, the way the voice chat works is awesome with it being a close distance thing. 

The equipment in the game is really cool and really lets you deal with the situation in many different ways. Having to think about what you should take in first, as overthinking this could totally screw you over. 

I cant wait for the devs to add more to this! i can see so much potential, its already really playable and perfect, i noticed the ghosts dont have walking animations through the eyes of the cameras but that might just be me. 

One thing id love to see is more levels, or ghosts or even ways to hunt and find more ghosts, maybe more equipment even though you guys added so much already its just perfection. 
I saw the computer in the truck had a big speaker placed in there, maybe have those linked to the sound scanners to hear whats going on.
Maybe have moments where the ghost EMPs the truck and radio so your blinded to whats going on in there for a few seconds. 

I really suggest you try this game out atleast once, its a blast with friends.",1601855428,1601855428,TRUE,0,0,0,1,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,151,5,706,706,443,1602003578,,

Atmosphere is pretty good as it doesn't heavily rely on jumpscares or loud noises to frighten you (but it does have a few). The game mechanics are fairly easy to understand. The tutorial is helpful but I'd say experience is the best teacher. For an early access game, it's pretty well-made.

Can't wait to see what other kinds of entities and/or game mechanics they're going to add. I do recommend people to purchase it and give it a try. 

I also have to mention the community. I can't say I've had a bad experience with them. People tend to be really friendly, funny, and pretty helpful too! You have a question? You won't get judged for asking. You don't need to play with friends to have fun. You can meet up with some players at public servers or opt to look for them at the official Discord.

Menus are a bit wonky to navigate with a controller which I'm hoping gets better over time (there is probably no issue in VR as menu navigation seems built for it; I usually use a mouse). 

Pros:
Super atmospheric
Good controller support considering game was seemingly built with VR intentions
Great fun with friends
Scary as all hell even with friends or without

Cons:
Run isnt run ... its walk with a gait
Timer is a weird mechanic IMO. 
Some places are really, really large and sometimes trying to find evidence is almost impossible before being killed
Keyboard&Mouse/Controller requires pinpoint accuracy for interacting with objects sometimes, especially with things that are thin

[b] Less Good [/b]

-buggy at times, but too be expected from a one man developer crew
-cant fix settings in-game only in the game menu
-some what an weird UI
-death animation atm is a bit weird (The animation is only from behind, meaning even if the ghost is coming right at you, the animation will show as if he came from behind you.)


[b] Summary: [/b]
[i] Good and scary game, unique gameplay, cool gadgets and equipment, tactics based game.
performance is good overall (have not played VR version).
The game is in an early stage and there is only one developer atm which is doing everything from his side meaning, bug fixes, content updates, etc. its alot to do for being one man and too fix and entire game averaging 40k players, so cut some slack.

I can see this game being a huge success, and most likely one of the best horror games this year. I am intrigued to see what new content that the developers will add to this fantastic game. I am very pleased with my purchase.

Pros: 
- Lots of equipment for ghost hunting, so everyone has some sort of task to do
- Different variants of ghosts, so each play style is different
- Has a lot of levels and difficulties so it never feels the same
- Having the ghosts respond to your microphone in the game is an extremely unique and horrifying concept

Cons:
- When players die, there is not much they can do besides sitting and waiting
- Some maps feel very large, so it may be hard to find some of the ghosts there

What can I say about this game?  It's definitely something that'll freak you out immensely.  If you have a heart condition or anything that can put you out if you freak out by scares, then avoid this produce.  However, if you're adventurous enough, I fully recommend it, and it makes for a good bowl unblocker.

The Breakdown (on a 1-5 scale)
Graphics: 4.75  
I like the realism in this game.  The graphics to an amazing job creating the right atmosphere.  The only thing is it's ALWAYS RAINING AND STORMING!  I get that it's supposed to create the ambiance of the game, but every single home so far that I've visited had rain.

Sound: 5
I have to give it to the sound on this one; it's one of the main items that brings the fear level up.  Random noises can startle you and just the sound when you enter the house or place sends chills everywhere.  You suddenly hear doors creaking open or closed or maybe an object is thrown and hits the wall with an audible thud?  Yeah.....that'll get ya going.  Couple that with the fact that it uses your mic to actually call out to the ghost to cause all sorts of things to happen and you have something cooking.  The dynamic audio works very well here.  If you have a group of players, the audio cuts or muffles itself depending on how far away someone is from you and your voice can actually be used to call out a ghost by speaking its name and using the spirit box to have it respond to you.

Controls: 4
I'll give it to the classic PC keyboard/mouse; they're near flawless.
Where I'm taking points off of here is the controls for VR.  Depending on what equipment you're using will change the layout of the buttons.  I use a Rift S and the buttons aren't very clear on what does what because they don't have the proper layout for the controllers I use.  If they change the layout to explain the VR controls based on the equipment used, then I'll give it a full 5.  The controls themselves work very VERY well, but because it's not fully clear what does what, you'll fumble around with them.  Despite the learning curve, the VR controls do work.

Gameplay: 4.5
Oooh, this is goooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooood.  I can't give it a full-on score because of the cumbersome controls in VR, but for the keyboard/mouse, I'd say it's a 5.  The game is easy to pick up and play, but there are a few keyboard commands you'll want to look over.  Using the 2nd function of an item isn't the same as chucking something with ""G"".  For example, the video camera you use can be placed with F, but if you use G, the camera can land upside down.  It boils down to reading the controls once you get into the game.

Overall: 4.8
This game did scare me and it got me in the best way possible: the shade spawned in front of me as I re-entered the house and I nope'd the fuck outta there after that, not even bothering with the other evidence.  As a single-player experience, it's fun, but do expect to get frustrated if you can't figure out what evidence you collect.  I tried for 30 minutes trying to get something other than an EMF of 5 as my first evidence, but never could get any other evidence.  It's probably because you do have to buy certain equipment, but you start off with a basic camera, emf reader, book for spirits to write in, a UV flashlight, a regular flashlight, and video camera.  You have to earn money by completing objectives and finding out what kind of ghost is haunting a particular place.

All in all, for those looking for something in spooptember, I HIGHLY recommend this game.  It'll put some fear of ghost in ya for sure.",1601842615,1601842615,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,213,38,184,184,184,1601841685,,

15,Phasmophobia,77044063,english,"This is a fantastic game for the amount of time it's been out. I've screamed like a child and got terrified whenever my dog would do something behind me. 

I can find very few things wrong with this game, other than a few minor control issues, like the slow 'sprint' speed. 


I understand this is still early access, but I do have some suggestions that can add to replay value and make the game more difficult.

I think they should add a new clue line, such as extremely hot heat or sulfur in the air, the heat seen with thermometer and sulfuric air having some kind of gas detector. Doing this will make room for new ghosts and require more thought before taking gear to a location.

adding maps is always good, but for now, the largest maps are more than enough. 

Adding in additional dangers, like thrown objects being able to hit you and make you stumble or perhaps knock items out of your hands would be great and have more objects able to me moved by the ghost like computers or even beds. it would add to the creep factor a lot, in my opinion. 

a female and a child voice actor would go a long way in making things more diverse as well. 

Diverse killing animation other than a pair of hands grabbing your eyes, such as an axe or something swinging at you out of the darkness, or the ghost leaps at you from above/below.

56,Phasmophobia,77042196,english,"So this is a game about hunting ghosts. You get paid for completing objectives, and you use that money to buy equipment to aid you in your ghost hunting.

There are several types of ghosts and you have to find clues, such as, cold temperatures, EMF meter readings, spirit box interactions, etc. You collect up to three clues and use those to determine what type of ghost is haunting the house. Some ghosts can be more dormant. Some ghosts can be very aggressive. But they are all capable of killing you if you aren't careful.

You'll know when a ghost is hunting because the lights in the house and your flashlight will start flickering. It's time to hide! Run into another room or into a closet and close the door. Sit still and be quiet!

The game has push to talk in both local (people around you), and with a radio, (you can chat remotely). The game has voice recognition system so that you can actually speak the ghost's name and you can usually get a response. Sometimes more negative and aggressive. 

Keep in mind even if you aren't pressing push to talk, the game still picks up your mic and the ghost can hear you.

As you collect your clues, you can put them into your journal and it will help narrow down what type of ghost you have. Select this when you know for sure, and then leave in the truck.

My first few games were very interesting. First game was with a girl who was leading us who heavily emphasized we don't spread out, and instead stay together. Eventually the ghost got agitated and started hunting us. So naturally we follow the person leading us into another room, in which the ghost followed and killed her. She raged over the mic at us for doing so. I pointed out that I followed her direction. To which she responded with some pretty angry choice of words.

Next game was with two jolly Germans. We got spooked, laughed, and had a grand old time.

When you get a good lobby, the experience is unlike any game I have played in VR, but enjoy it because some idiot will crash the party before the next round..

Don't think I would really enjoy it outside of VR...but, whoa. VR is awesome. It reminds me of the old paranormal investigation tv shows that terrified me growing up, I think that is the intention.

Game shows how a very satisfying and thrilling game can be created without the need for impossibly simplified violence. It is a great choice that you cannot fight the spirit, only evade or ward off. The evidence and identification, while very simple is thrilling. This could almost be a board/card game with its loop.

VR makes this game super immersive and fun if you have it, but if not, the game is great on PC as well. You can play on PC with your friends who are in VR.

Suggestions:
- Add more maps, tools, and ghost types
- Add more depth to ghost-player interactions or perhaps multiple stages to hauntings
- Decrease reliability of flashlights, the game is scarier when it is darker
- Add the option to run for a burst of time that will tire your player
- Add more symptoms of low sanity, such as visual and audible hallucinations
- Give incentives to wander alone, but at a price. Grouping up decreases fear.",1601832145,1601832364,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,132,1,1102,1102,855,1601958126,,

72,Phasmophobia,77036584,english,"It's not often I get genuinely scared by a horror game, and upon launching Phasmophobia for the first time I wasn't expecting much when I saw the Unity logo pop up on the screen. Oh boy was I wrong.

Upon first glance at Phasmophobia it comes across as a cheap, taped together survival/horror game, but after a few hours playing I learned that there's so much more than meets the eye.

The rules are simple, in a team of up to four players, you assume the role of paranormal investigators. Initially only being equipped with basic tools you enter a haunted house, as your player level progresses you can unlock access to other spooky locations such as an abandoned high-school and a derelict mental asylum.
Each location has been inhabited by a paranormal entity, it's your team's job to locate which room this being inhabits, and then endure the ensuing horror as you desperately try to figure out which of the nine types of ghosts it is.

Each ghost has unique abilities and tell-tale signs, such as freezing temperatures, fingerprints that can only be found with a UV light, ghost orbs which are only found with the remote video camera etc.

Phasmophobia promotes and rewards teamwork, mostly requiring one player to stay behind in the 'command centre' overseeing each player's sanity as well as recording sound data, player location, paranormal activity (There, I said it) and watching live video footage through either security cameras, remote video cameras or mounted 'GoPros'

For those who are a sucker for realism and immersion I would highly recommend you use the in-game voice communications instead of a third-party software. The in-game voice quality is second to none and the radio communications really do their part to immerse you into the horrors that is Phasmophobia.

I would highly recommend this game to anyone who thinks they can stomach it.

-----------------------------

This is such a great horror game, with a lot of genuinely scary moments! It has a very suspenseful atmosphere, and a building sense of urgency as you work your way through identifying the ghost and completing other objectives, especially as the ghost gets more and more pissed off. 

The game perfectly encapsulates the vibe from those ghost hunting shows, with the radio communication between the team, and the ability to communicate with the ghosts using voice recognition. [i]I highly recommend using in-game voice comms as opposed to Discord, for the full experience.[/i]

It's great playing with your friends, and in my experience it's also worth mixing things up by playing with randoms, as with different teams comes an element of unpredictability resulting in a different playstyle/experience. So far I've met some cool people and it's been a good laugh!

I look forward to continue playing while following the development, and I highly recommend the game to anyone interested in the co-op horror genre.

10,Phasmophobia,77034445,english,"So, what can I say about Phasmophobia?  The game is in early alpha and, but already has all the makings of a great game.  The dev is actively working on bug fixes and there is a very active and friendly community, so as of now, all of that is good.

So now, the gameplay.  The game has its spooky moments, but a lot of how scary it is has to do with who you play with.  Playing by yourself, especially on a level like the high school or asylum can be very nerve wracking and provide some genuine moments of dread as you cower behind a desk by yourself while the ghost stomps around looking for you.  On the other end of the spectrum, if you play with a group of skilled goofballs, you'll end up with some really funny and memorable shenanigans.

Example 1:
-We needed a ghost to act up in order to get evidence, but it was only skirting around us and hissing on occasion.  We knew the ghost acted up around people who were alone, so we sent in one guy to go flirt with the ghost as the rest of us stayed in the van and watched on the cameras we set up.  Through his valiant efforts, the ghost started to reciprocate his passion and started to show up more.  We all got out alive, but sadly, our partner didn't get the ghost's number.

Example 2:
-We wanted to get a ghost to act up so we could fulfill an extra objective and were feeling somewhat daring, so we all piled into the same bedroom, jumped around on the bed, and the other three team members chanted out the ghost's name as I serenaded everyone with my Mongolian throat singing.  To my surprise, the ghost didn't enjoy this display and even told me to go die over the spirit box.  We all survived this encounter as well.

All in all, this game has a solid foundation and I am excited to see what it becomes as the developer puts more levels, items, and ghosts into the game (still hoping they add a fishing trawler level as a small map).  Ultimately, the game is what you make it though, as you can have more fun with an outgoing group or a spooky time with a more serious group.

14,Phasmophobia,77034276,english,"I am not normally a fan of horror games, as most use the same recycled tactics to 'scare' you. This game is a bit different, however. After stumbling across a few streams, it looked alright, decided to give it a try. What I was witnessing was people streaming the game exhibiting genuine fear/nervousness. Seeing it in Early Access had me slightly concerned, as I've been burned many times before by a crappy unfinished game. I am here to tell you that yes, it may be technically unfinished, but sweet mother it delivers. Instead of focusing on scripted jumpscares, or disturbing imagery, or obscene amounts of gore, this game manages to deliver 100% genuine fear and the adrenaline rush that goes with it. This is a proper horror game entry; psychological terror extraordinaire. The visuals I would rate a solid 6.5/10. It's nothing to write home about, but they're not cardboard cutouts either. What sells the terror to me more than anything else is the sound design. Floorboards creak, items move about the room, stairs crunch, whispers hit your ear (and legitimately sound spatially close/correct). Anyone with a decent set of headphones is in for a bad time, and I mean that in a good way. The doors flinging open/closed in front of you are spooky, but not scary. What makes them scary (to me) is hearing them open/close outside your field of vision, or hearing ghastly footsteps near you when you are the only one present, or hearing a ghost materialize behind you... So again, for me, 75% of the spoop-factor is in the sound design.

Numerous times I've soiled my drawers, sat in corners and cried, or simply Alt+F4'd. The effect is duly exaggerated in VR. I play both non-VR and VR (Rift S) with friends (you can technically play solo, but I am too big a baby to do so. If you ""don't have friends,"" head over to the Phasmophobia Discord and hook up with the fine folks there. I have had many a good time with total strangers looking to get spooked). I have not had A) This much fun and B) This much anxiety/stress over a game in years. For the EA price of $13.99, you will absolutely get your moneys' worth, and more. Also worth noting, I have personally experienced a handful of small, inconvenient bugs from time to time, but am perfectly okay with them (remember, game is still Early Access), as the developer is actively patching most of them out, and is very involved with the community.

TLDR;
Game may be technically unfinished, but is absolutely guaranteed to give you a real scare. Amazing horror game. Does not focus on jumpscare tactics or violent gore. Instead, keeps you awake at night with psychological torture.

It nails the atmosphere of being a paranormal investigator, using all the tools to figure out what type of ghost it is that you're actually hunting, and the game can be legitimately terrifying at times. However, I just cannot recommend it in the state that it is currently in. The movement speed is painfully slow. I don't know if the devs did this to make the game more scary, but it's just ultimately frustrating. The game would be just as spooky if you didn't move at the pace of a snail going through molasses. The game is also extremely buggy. I do understand that it's a small indie team making the game, but that doesn't excuse the fact that whenever I complete a mission there's like a 50% chance that my screen is pitch black and I have to close and relaunch the game.

At the beginning of playing the game, I did not want to go in alone -- the change of ambient noise from being outside to being in the location was scary. The darkness and the random creaks, opening and closing of doors, moving objects and hearing footsteps and voices really spooked me. I hated every time we had to go to the generator to be able to turn the lights back on.

For a person like me who's a huge horror fan/nerd, I don't get scared easily. Let's just say the game managed to break further beyond that barrier, which I think is saying something...

Example: I was playing with a friend of mine atm. We collected and set up the gear in the places we thought would fit best for getting good footage of the entity, but little did we know that we were going up against an Oni. After setting up a couple things downstairs, we then began to hear things that were seemingly happening on the floor above us, so we obviously went up to investigate. We found a bedroom and began to joke about how the entity was a ""gamer"" because of the tall desktop pc and the two displays that were on a table in the room. I than forgot that after five minutes the entity will begin going on hunts every now and then and I began to slightly panic, thinking that we had no where to hide. I noticed that there was a closet behind me and pointed it out and said how I was going to leave one of the closet doors open just in case if it were to start hunting us. GOD AM I THANKFUL I SAW THAT DAMN CLOSET! Just barely a minute later, the lights began to flicker violently and the EMF reader that I laid on the bed began to spike up higher and higher on the lights. I looked at my friend and screamed that we needed to get in the closet right now. After entering the closet, we remained silent in the closet as the EMF was blaring outside at a level 5 and proceeded to hear footsteps that got louder and louder. Never have I felt so god damn scared in my life since I was 7 years old, when I accidentally watched a rated R horror film for the first time. After the EMF went quiet we assumed it was gone, but we were very well aware it was on the same floor we were on. We were forced to stay in the closet four more times afterwards because it kept coming back into our room over and over... damn that thing was active as hell! Knowing that it was going to find us eventually and that we can't sit in there for long, I counted to three to my friend and proceeded to open the closet door and we fucking booked it out of there. My friend ironically got a head start before me and darted down the stairs and as I was slowly trailing behind him I hear him panic for a split second and then go quiet. I then come to realize that the ghost got to him and locked the damn front door. I ended up grabbing a pair of keys placed within a bowl in the living room which was next to the front door, opened the door, and in mere seconds I hear fast paced footsteps occur behind me as I exited the building. Through all that shit, I got $10, but my unfortunate friend got half of that...

Never in my life have I feared for my safety so much until now!
You should too if you ever play this game!

10/10 tbh
The first game that has managed to break my ""not being scared barrier"" and manged to go beyond that!

Advice for those who may be new to the game:
- Try to reduce the amount of times you say the entity's name, it may be your last words. However, if there is absolutely no activity occurring, feel comfortable to state it's name once or more out loud with a simple question like for example, ""how old are you"" or ""how did you die.""
- Turn on the lights in areas you may not be active in, it just might possibly hint the location of the spirit if the lights shut off in that specific area (not saying this works all the time, but it's helped me out a bunch of times when playing).
- If the unfortunate event happens where any lights begin to flicker violently, get to place that will conceal yourself from the entity such as a locker, bedroom closet, basically any tight space that you can squeeze yourself into that may give you a chance at surviving the attack.
- If the entity locks the entrance door to the building, each map is different, but there should be keys lying around that are colored differently. I yet still have to discover what the colors stand for, but all I know is that you should grab it and head for the entry door, it should unlock it.

This game is phenomenal in so many different ways and I'll be looking forward to future updates as they come by! Keep up the great work and good luck to those who are new and experienced on your future hunts!  :)",1601820193,1601820338,TRUE,1,0,0.523809552,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,82,3,1370,1370,551,1602037128,,

29,Phasmophobia,77026294,english,"If you've seen a ghost-hunting show on television, you'll know exactly what you'll be doing in Phasmophobia. Ideally played in a co-op setting, Phasmo pits you and your ghost-hunting team against one of a variety of different types of malevolent spirits haunting locales. Your goal is to primarily identify which ghost type you're dealing with by observing its characteristics and entering data into a notebook that you have. This is done by utilizing your ghostbuster tools. Things like UV lights, which allow you to see phantom handprints or thermometers, which allow you to register cold spikes when supernatural presences are nearby. Upon successfully identifying the ghost, your team leaves the site and earns money and XP based on how much evidence is acquired and whether or not you're accurate in your assessment.

Sound technical? Only slightly. The real fun of the game is in how this is all done. Talk about an atmospheric experience, Phasmo delivers on the chills. One of the most unique features to the game is that the game listens to everything you actually say over your mic. It's open mic and the spirits are listening. This means that you can ask the spirits questions, encourage them to appear, or even anger them.. all based on what you chatter over the mic. Want to hear something scary? Ask a spirit if it can show you a sign of its presence. Few games incorporate a mechanic like this into gameplay and the result is absolutely terrifying.

""Ghost sign"" begins sometimes as slight as listening for a small creak or knock in another room. Sometimes things will move or you'll even hear a faint whisper or breath. The audio is mind-numbingly chilling in every way and almost requires a headset. Want the full experience? Turn off the lights. As many ghosts only appear when you're alone and in the dark, you can see how this primes the experience for terror.

There is depth to this game. It is a highly novel concept and great fun with friends. I highly recommend Phasmophobia and it retails for a very affordable price. Get it!",1601819485,1601819485,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,1115,97,296,296,296,1601787391,,

The only cons i can think of right now are that there's quite a few bugs, however none are really game-breaking or frustrating, and they're being patched up almost daily.

That and it runs on Unity engine.  Why?

Regardless, this game is incredible, i've been playing it all day every day for the last week and I rarely get hooked this hard by games.  There's so much potential for development in the future, like new ghosts/evidence, types of hauntings, and maps (literally endless potential there).

74,Phasmophobia,77021726,english,"I absolutely love this game. sure it has some issues in connections at times. but it's really great for an indie game in early acces.

the main tip I would give the dev: double down a bit more on the horror. right now, it ramps up from 0 to 100 real quick. it's scary, but I would like to see some more & different/new random events to scare players while still at level 0, while keeping the 0 to 100 very fast. and on bigger map, some more activity in general would be nice as well. and just in general some more randomization regarding map lay-out and ghost(-activities) would be great.

also because of activity going from 0 to 100 so quickly, death is too often no preventable. maybe give the player a bigger window to 'escape' the ghost attack?

other than that, I think the game is amazing and it's worth the price FOR SURE. great atmosphere, scary moments, pretty solid controlls, good gameplay and very fun.

Creeping around every corner with the utmost of caution as not to disturb the ever-present and dooming threat that is the ghost.  Every single ghost interaction I have had in this game, inside of VR and on desktop, has been truly heart dropping.  If you want a genuinely high quality and terror fuelled game that has very fun and repeatable missions, I would highly highly recommend this game.  This game has given me something fresh and exciting with it's varied locations and in depth ghost hunting strategies and I cannot recommend it enough.  

Even if you absolutely hate horror games and you could never imagine yourself playing it, I recommend that you do.  Being full of absolute dread in a situation like that in Virtual Reality gives you such a rush that is so difficult to explain.  

This game can be played completely solo, but I personally wouldn't recommend it.  The game becomes much more technical based and team oriented when you can play with friends or even randoms that you find in public lobbies.  

Awesome graphics, absolutely stellar sound design that perfectly encircles you in mysterious and anxiety inducing creaks and bangs around the house. It truly makes you feel like you're being watched, or even the feeling of being in the same room as the entity is super immersive.  You will KNOW when you're near the ghost, or when IT is near YOU...

The premise of this game is quite simple, you are a 1-4 man team and your goal is gather evidence about the ghost that inhabits the premises. The type of ghost varies and sometimes only 1 person can be with the ghost at once (very scary). I can't go into much more detail without giving anything away, but the experience this game provides is absolutely amazing.

I have played this in both VR (index) and desktop; it's safe to say the game is no where near as scary in desktop mode once you have been in VR. If you're using an Index, I suggest that you use a custom mapping for the game as it will make you feel incredibly nauseous otherwise.

Not this one, even playing with friends we suffer heart attacks. You need good friends and good teamwork to make this game a fun, terrifying, and enjoyable experience.

The creativity is really nice. Not only do they have different buildings, they match it to the environment, sounds included, and adds a lot of details to the insides that you would find. Cabin in the woods being completely different to a house in the suburbs. And their scares. They do a really nice job at having jump scares without doing jump scares. Very well done on all those.

38,Phasmophobia,77016618,english,"This game is a good idea, and I hope it will get better as it comes out of early access (in which case I will update the review) 

The ghosts are basically all the same, and the thermometer is way too strong. The ghosts also need have the ability to turn off the camera or something. I think we need significantly more interaction with the ghost, and to do something with it, rather than just get evidence of it. 

The difficulty mechanics are just terrible (right now). Basically all difficulty is just larger maps so it takes longer to find the ghost, which is still not a problem because thermometer exists. They need to require you to do something to protect yourself from the ghost short of just running away. Could easily use the speech-to-text to that end. (power of christ compels you with the crucifix etc), and it could be different based on what ghost. 

The developers in my opinion need to run as far away from the L4D2 feel as they can as quickly as possible. I think it just ruins the fun of the game to have to do it once and have it figured out and feel like you're done with it. Once you ""get"" how to deal with the ghosts it really drains the fun out of it.

I like how there's scaling difficulty with the professional modes and bigger maps, which certainly makes ghost hunting effectively a bit more challenging. But once you've nailed down the process, everyone goes on auto pilot. 

The co-op factor of this game is what makes it more anxiety-inducing yet more more fun as well. I would say some objectives or clues still require more polishing though - e.g. preventing a hunt using a crucifix, how the ghost chooses their targets during a hunt (sometimes it goes for the person nearest it, sometimes it goes for the person with lowest sanity, etc., which is a little hard to tell). 

Other than those small stuffs, the game is pretty much seamless. Kudos to the developer!

[i] Phasmophobia - The fear of ghosts is sometimes referred to as phasmophobia and erroneously spectrophobia, the latter being an established term for fear of mirrors and one's own body. [/i]

[b] Plot [/b]

You or up-to three investigators try their hand at solving several paranormal mysteries. Using various equipment to discover the spirit before them. Can they keep their Sanity during their investigation? Will they survive? 

[b] In Depth Look [/b]

You're an investigator investigating several locations to gather intel about the Spirit that roams that area. Gather the correct evidence for the Spirit Removal Team. Start off with Amateur difficulty and Small locations (Farmhouse, Resident Homes) and make your way to Medium sized locations (High School, Asylum). Level your character to unlock better gadgets (Head-mounted Cameras, Mobile Microphones etc.). You use your journal to figure out which Spirit you are encountering based on different clues you can get. You have five minutes to search the location and find the Spirits' location (Randomly Selected) and setup your equipment. Use DSLR Camera's with Infrared and other gadgets. Use your journal to mark down the found clues to narrow down your Spirit. Use the Spirits bio to determine your next clue assessment.  Be careful because the Spirits can hear you. Careful not to say their name as it will only anger them. Sometimes this is required to gather specific intel on them. Just know they are always listening and will react at any moment. You need to stay on your toes and always move as a team unless the Spirit prefers otherwise, but keep a close eye on their Sanity. 

[i] Sanity [/i]

A very important piece of your characters mental stability and overall survival chance. Keep an eye on this as it can affect how your character can last during a high activity run for the Spirit. 

[i] Spirit Activity [/i]

Notated in the base truck is the current and 60 second limit Spirit Activity. Ranging from 1-10 will show the severity of the Spirits activity. 10 means the Spirit is in hunt mode and you should be on your toes and should hide or leave the place immediately. 

[i] Sensor Activity [/i]

Similar to Spirit activity this relates to your motion/sound sensor gadgets. Directly linked to your home base for remote readings. Place sound and motion sensors throughout the location to see where they are lighting up and what the strength is. This helps mainly for larger missions.

[h1] Overall [/h1]

This game is fantastic with friends. This game is absolutely terrifying. It's perfectly priced for where it's at. It has a tremendous amount of potential. I streamed this game for 5.75 hours straight and experienced a lot of gameplay mechanics that I love. The replay rate is high. I can't wait to see what these developers come up with moving forward and how it will be polished in the future.

Of course, though, it isn't without its flaws, which I see why it's in Early Access, and I'm sure they're being addressed, but here is what I noted, and what I'm criticizing:
- With how often I play with my friends, they [u]constantly run into long loading times[u] or the game just ends up [u]freezing/crashing[u]. It seems that only more high-end PCs can run the game, and that's kind of dumb considering some of my friends have managed to run and play GTA V without many issues (that isn't internet related, anyway)
- [u]The ""sprint"" doesn't [i]feel[i] like a sprint at all[u], if I had to be honest. I'm not gonna entirely diss this out, but I wish it was a little faster. I just don't like how slow it is, considering how there's medium and large maps, and traversing these maps at the speed the sprint is just doesn't cut it.
- [u]Make whoever starts the game lobby [b]always[b] be the game session leader[u]. It kinda appears to be random whoever gets it, and I believe that what happens is whoever manages to join the lobby back the fastest gets leader, which is a little annoying having to pick the levels through ""turns"".

But as I further obtained knowledge on how to properly communicate with my team sufficiently and authentically with my Blue Yeti Snowball mic $100 at ebgames, the game kind of lost it's fear factor with me being able to expect what will happen. There will be certain times where the ghost would take quite a while to give us evidence and it gets a bit boring after a while unless you're playing with as I like to call it, ""the boys"".

I also personally think that the graphics and character models are very, how do I put this, minimalistic. But this game is early access so it's expected, the camera in the truck also is very weird. 

In conclusion this game gets very boring as it is repetitive and has no jumpscares and yada yada what other horror games have. You can literally slap the ghost's ass when it just shows itself when it's not hunting. It's actually just plain weird. Anyways I look forward to the finished product as I think this game could look better and do so much more if it wants to compete in the horror industry.

15,Phasmophobia,76622158,english,"A REALLY well made indie game!

This isn't your regular half-baked indie horror game! This game goes far above and beyond what you'd expect of an indie horror game! There's no major story plot to speak of... and that's perfectly fine. In fact, I'd say that plays to the games strength.

The players are basically ghost hunters who go out and investigate haunted locations. The primary objective of every game is to identify what kind of ghost you're dealing with and they're not all the same. There are multiple different types of ghosts and they all have varying behaviours and require varying methods to identify them, which is where the challenge comes from in this game. You CANNOT go blindly guessing what kind of ghost you're dealing with, you will more often than not have to risk your mortal neck to figure out who and what you're dealing with.

There are multiple maps in this game, you start out with small houses before moving on to the larger, good ol' fashioned abandoned schools and asylums. Don't think for a second that experiencing each location once allows you to know what to expect either as there are even different variations of each map, meaning you're unlikely to get the exact same map, or ghost, twice. At least not in a row. This also plays into the games strength greatly as never knowing what you're gonna get keeps you on your toes and just adds to the scare factor.

The level of interaction between the players and the ghosts also plays greatly into the scare factor. Like I said before, in order to identify the ghost type, you'll need to risk your mortal neck. You'll have to set up camera's, look for hand prints, pay close attention to it's behaviour and even communicate with it! There's no easy way to do it either as the game was deliberately designed to be difficult. If you accidentally drop your equipment and don't know where you lost it, it's as good as gone. Your equipment is precious, especially your starting gear as you'll need it to identify the ghost type, so for the love of god don't drop them!

This game does have some minor downsides however, some to be expected from an Early-Access game (at least as I'm writing this) and some that are just poor design. For instance, the in-game VOIP is a little buggy. Sometimes when you enter a game, you might not be able to hear a player when other players can hear that player fine. Another bug with the VOIP is the Ghost Box which is basically the tool that allows you to speak with ghosts. However, sometimes it doesn't quite read your voice correctly, which is strange since in post-release patch 1, it was working perfectly fine and could read my voice almost perfectly, but after post-release patch 2, it started failing to even realise I was talking into it half the time, let alone correctly interpreting what I'm trying to say.

There is also an issue where the game will give you a red-herring and I'm at least 90% sure that this isn't intended to be a feature. Sometimes the game will give you a completely wrong piece of evidence for a ghost. For example, in one game I was playing with my friends we got the evidences: Ghost Box, Freezing Temperature and Handprint. These 3 evidences together mean't that it was a Wraith type. But when we left in the truck after putting the ghost type in our journals, the game SUDDENLY FUCKING DECIDED that the ghost was actually a Yurei which is a ghost that's supposed to produce Ghost Orbs on camera feeds and write in the Ghost Book, to which we didn't get either. Needless to say, this was pretty frustrating.

Despite it's issues and shortcomings (which will hopefully be iron'd out long before the game comes out of Early Access) the game is still a very atmospheric and damn well made experience and I ABSOLUTELY recommend getting it while it's still cheap!

You'd never guess at first glance that this is an indie game with how high-quality the atmosphere and attention-to-detail is! And only for £10!

Phasmophobia is an immersive VR game where you play as a ghost hunter along with 3 other friends or randoms. The game consists in finding clues and evidence of the existence of supernatural beings: taking photos, witnessing the creature strangling another poor fellow and piecing information together to find what type of creature it is. All of this while trying to stay alive from the murdering ghost.

First hour in, I have been spooked multiple times. Ten hours in, I've learned the mechanics because of its balance in simplicity and complexity. 15 hours in, I am still not bored with the different interactions that the ghost has to offer. Every game feels like I'm replaying the first hour as there is just so many things that can happen, complimented with the scare factor. 

Can't believe that this game is in early access and I cannot wait to see its potential once it is fully released.

Saying its name pisses it off?
I can stand alone in a dark room with a friend in the van repeating the name and not get a ghost appearance for a solid minute. Does ghost hunting reflect this? Probably, don't get a reaction 90 percent of the time in ""real"" ghost hunting. However in this game,you get ghosts that don't bother appearing, or appear once every 5 minutes due to being shy.

Additionally, one of the main ways to consistently find the room the ghost resides in, the thermometer, seems to be particularly inconsistent. Despite the book saying all spirits make rooms at least somewhat cold, that is false. You can easily explore the house having the same temperature throughout. Only time it seems to work is only under the condition of ""freezing temps"" and nothing else. Which, at a low level, makes narrowing the ghost's room down very tedious and is only worsened by the inconsistent ghost responses.

TL;DR
Pros: Good atmosphere, VR and voice chat only is very scary.
Cons: Tedious and monotonous gameplay combined with inconsistent mechanics make the game easily boring after getting used to said atmosphere.",1601792273,1601792405,FALSE,4,0,0.532108605,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,106,2,341,341,341,1601786543,,

[b]Pros:[/b]
 -Very immersive, especially with a decent headset
 -Good at scares without relying on cheap jumpscares for everything
 -Figuring things out is really satisfying! You feel like you actually accomplished something at the end of a successful mission
 -Level design doesn't feel boring. You get used to most of them quickly, but it doesn't detract from the game much if all
 -Good amount of content for how long it's been out.
 -Some levels can be played solo easily, but you also don't feel pressured to play with a full team of four in order to do anything. (Though if you choose not to team up on the larger levels then good luck)

[b]Cons:[/b]
 -Object interactions are a bit iffy at times. Be it placing them or picking them up.
 -Voice servers aren't perfect but are at least being worked on
 -The tutorial gives the barest information and doesn't explain certain mechanics necessary for actual play.
 -The game occasionally crashes upon loading into a hunt for no reason. 
 -Your mic sensitivity skyrockets (as intended for the game I assume) but if you have extra mics attached and enabled but not in use as your primary, it seems to pick those up as well instead of just your primary. Which has actually gotten me killed before I figured out it was doing that and disabled the other mics.
 -It leaves you to figure a lot of things out on your own, which isn't a bad thing, but there's some things that you may not pick up on at all without looking at other people's experiences.

And now for more elaboration......

First off, this is a very immersive game. Headphones are your friend...and your worst enemy. The ambiance on it's own is great but the fact that you *have* to pay attention to the various sounds of the house to pick up hints and clues as to what is going on means that you find yourself startled by the sound of your friends simply walking up the stairs.  And then you get scared out of your wits by the ghost breathing in your ear a moment after. And when the action picks up and you're crammed in a closet...oh does it make everything even more terrifying. The spacial audio is perfect, and later larger levels actually add in an echo to your local voice chat which makes things even spookier.

At the moment voice servers are a bit sketchy but most of the bugs I've experienced have already been reported and the developer is actively working on solution and putting out fixes, or partial fixes, so that's a lovely thing to see. And most of the time you can fix it by leaving and rejoining the game. Annoying, yes, but you don't have to mess with anything in the program files or anything like other games I've played in this early of development so I'm counting that as a win.

The variety of locations is fairly good as well- I'm not extremely high level yet so I only have I believe...6 or 7 areas unlocked at the moment and I don't know if there's more I just haven't gotten to, but each one is varied enough that it takes you a few tries to start learning them and what rooms are where. Not that you have to memorize every location, but it certainly helps. The larger maps I have access to are quite a spike in size and are overwhelming at first, for sure. But they aren't terrible either and actually feel and look like the locations they say they are supposed to be instead of just large areas with random furniture.

The ghost variety is nice too! There's already several 'types' of ghosts you have to identify, each with their own little behaviors and clues but not completely so different that you can immediately look at something and know what ghost you're dealing with. That being said, sometimes despite collecting all the clues and figuring out the ghost type, the ghost doesn't behave like it should. Some of that I imagine is part of the charm, to keep people from figuring it out from behavior only, but sometimes it feels completely random how the ghost is going to behave and I'm not sure it's fully intended on that aspect. But, then again I could be wrong.

My major gripes are all basically quality of life things that I imagine are planned on being worked on in the future, but i'll list them anyways.

It feels like the journal needs more explanation for the tools you'll be using, and you need to be able to check it when not on an actual hunt. Being able to check your journal in a lobby would be great. A lot of things need more explanation that the tutorial just doesn't fully cover, but it's not impossible to figure out on your own.

The options menu is a bit confusing, not too bad but I personally like having tooltips that say what certain options do for those who might not be fully tech savvy when it comes to certain settings.

A 'test this item' option would be nice to try items in the lobby before buying them to use in game. If you die you don't get to keep your items so if you picked up an expensive parabolic microphone and then went to pester a ghost then died....well. There goes your expensive equipment. 

And explanation of a hunting phase!! Though, admittedly, it was fun to figure out what it was. But at least a mention of what might happen in one!

[b]TLDR;[/b] The game is incredibly impressive for how long it's been out. It's great if you like figuring things out and possibly getting scared at the same time and I could go on for longer about the mechanics and such, but it's more fun to discover yourself. Yes, there are bugs. Yes it's still in development.

I've never had so much fun in a coop game before. It's got some bugs but that's to be expected from an early access game. Sometimes the doors can rotate 360 degrees and end up stuck in the wall. Also, ghosts may not appear in a photograph even if you capture them. Hopefully small bugs like these will get patched in time. I haven't experienced any game-breaking bug so far.

17,Phasmophobia,77002953,english,"Let me start with.. I think this game has a LOT of potential! I like it! Whole review below vvv

Phasmophobia is an incredibly unique and enjoyable coop experience, that I would whole recommend to anyone looking at purchasing this game. As a solo-horror experience it is a reasonably scary game, one that will absolutely get a spook out of you or two. But the game shines brighter in its coop elements, and not in singleplayer. Anywhere from 2-4 extra players makes solving the haunts much easier, and more enjoyable, as they make bringing along extra equipment, and extra hands to handle all the equipment to minimize trips back to the van to restock. Each haunt lasts about 15-30 minutes, depending on difficulty and location of the haunt, all while you're using your equipment to track and record evidence of each different haunt (There are 10 possible ghostly encounters, among 5+ different maps currently). You connect into coop by generating a private room and inviting players through an invite code, and having them connect in-game, and not through Steam which is a hassle.. And you can't change a private room to a public, or vice versa, so if you want a full game of 4-players with you and your friend, you can't make a reserved spot, and just need to make it public, hope it doesn't fill before your friend joins, and if it does fill, you either need to kick players - which feels horrible for the person kicked, just so you can get your friend in for a full party, or else if you have a private room, you can only fill however many you invite.. Which if you have 3 friends to play with, awesome you have no troubles, otherwise you use the previous method... Hopefully this is fixed before leaving Early Access.. Other than connecting, the game feels a bit like a proof of concept to play, a few of the haunts will start to feel repetitive after a while, with minimal differences between certain ghosts, but as it's early access you can support it, and hope they enhance the game more, so haunts feel more different, and with more locations. Also - You are only given minimal amount of equipment going into missions, anything more you must buy with money you earn from completed haunts. Adding equipment to a mission takes it out of your inventory for the mission, completing the mission lets you get your equipment back, no hassle, no conditions, no needing to bring it back to the truck. But dying in a mission means you lose that equipment for the game, and its investment.. Plus you get less money at the end of the mission, just a note! But in conclusion, game is great fun to play with friends, and with decent spooks! Absolutely worth your money and time.

TLDR -
Pros:
Fun Cooperative gameplay! 1-4 players!
You can talk/taunt the ghosts over mic!
Spooky as heck!
Playing ghost detective is actually a lot of fun!
Low price tag!
Once you learn controls and equipment use, making ghost hunting efficient is fun!
Daily and bi-mission bonus objectives for more money per haunt! (Some are equipment specific, so make sure to bring one of everything if you can afford it!)

Cons:
A bit sluggish controls (Slow walking/sprinting, and almost mandatory rebinding.. VR or Desktop)
Making a party of half friends half randoms is harder than it needs to be
No steam invites
Some ghosts aren't nearly different enough
Some mechanics aren't explained in the tutorial (Crucifix / Smudging / Sensors)
A lot of trial and error in learning how to complete objectives, and find ghosts efficiently.",1601781809,1601781809,TRUE,1,0,0.523809552,1,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,178,6,2488,2488,740,1602027579,,

Having no story-line and being always randomly generated, combined with kind of realistic aspects of paranormal investigation makes this game truly scary. The fear of the main entrance locking itself, the lights turning out and the spirit haunting you, will terrify the crap out of you. 
Dying is actually not horrible at all, but the build up to that is. You only got maximum 3 items with you and got to head back to the truck to get the other ones. Every time you're out of the house you feel relieved. But you know you have to get back inside to gather evidence in order to find out what creature is haunting the place. 
In every other Horror game you run away from the monsters. But in this game your mission is to search, awake and trigger them. I think that is what makes it so much worse than other games.
I also love the grind that's going on. You get more money for getting much evidence. You need the money for better equipment. But once you die, you lose everything you brought. Which makes every decision really hard.

Well if you decided to play the game, play it with others. Unless you got balls/ovaries of steel to play it alone. But I promise: It'll scare the living hell out of you either ways.",1601777645,1601777645,TRUE,1,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,267,70,1167,1167,318,1602037351,,

Cons - The only bad thing I can say about this game is that when you're looking for the third piece of evidence it's usually very difficult and takes a long time before you can find it, the first two take no time at all, maybe we were just bad, but I don't know. Otherwise extremely good, if you played the Asylum or School at a low level and struggled, just wait until you get a higher level and all of the top end equipment and an assorted strategy with your friends to quickly decipher where the ghost is.

Pros
Atmosphere is always tense, keeps you guessing what's round every corner.
Random ghosts each time you play to keep things fresh.
Wide array of tools at your disposal.
Progression that allows you to buy better tools for more efficient ghostbusting.
Great, diverse ghost design, there will be at least one that spooks you the most.
Horrifying death animation that WILL get you every time.
Great sound design, spooky ambience and ghost noises.
Voice recognition that actually work properly. Using a ouija board and getting an accurate response for the first time filled me with a kind of dread I've never felt before. It felt like it was actually all real for a moment.

Cons (most of these are just nitpicks and don't detract from the game enough to stop you buying it)
Sometimes certain things like lamps or curtains will pop in, which is kind of immersion-breaking and can sometimes give you a fright when you're on edge.
Occasionally you'll be stuck with no evidence as the ghost isn't active at all, then suddenly hits level 10 and kills you. This can be pretty frustrating when you've been circling a location for 15 minutes trying different tools, only to die for nothing.
Ghosts pop in and out when appearing in a room. Maybe have them fade in and out, or some kind of animation?
Running (press and hold shift) is laughably slow, almost feels totally pointless.
You drop your items before the death animation plays which can take away from the scare since you'll be able to see it coming if you're paying attention to your tool.

Overall, Phasmophobia stands out as one the most interesting, entertaining and downright spine-chilling horror games I've ever played.

24,Phasmophobia,76992209,english,"Phasmophobia is a game with incredible potential. Despite how early in the Early Access period it is, it has great atmosphere and feel. It's a game with moments that you talk to your friends about.

""Hey, remember when you asked the ghost one question, and it murdered you?""
""Hey, remember when you were chased upstairs in the farmhouse?""
""Hey, remember when the ghost was named Thomas Thomas, and we summoned him using sing-song?""

But I don't want to focus on Phasmophobia as an experience because I'm happy with what I've gotten so far. I want to focus on playing the game.

First, I don't play in VR, but VR has a huge effect on us screen peasants. We move excruciatingly slow. My assumption is the characters move this slow not because this is a horror game but to prevent motion sickness for VR players. I honestly don't know how the developer is going to adjust this, but I wish them luck.

Every mission requires tools which are either for hunting, gathering, or protection.

Because speed is the most important thing on professional difficulty, the viability of hunting tools is all over the place. The king of detection is the thermometer. It does that job too well, even compared to the EMF reader which comes in a distant second. It's the difference between active sonar and a metal detector.

On the other hand, you have all of the sensors (sound, motion, infrared light). They need to be far more useful than farming secondary objectives. After all, why would slap down a sound sensor and motion sensor when a thermometer or EMF reader can focus in on the haunted room? Then you have parabolic mic which I honestly cannot see a use for at all, even on Asylum.

The gathering tools are all useful because they're all required to properly identify the ghost, but there are some inconsistencies. The spirit box in particular has issues. I don't know if it's because of its short range, the volatility of the voice servers, or something else. It's a shame too because that is my favorite gathering tool because MOOD.

There are only two protection tools: smudge sticks and crucifixes. I honestly can't say I know what smudge sticks do. I know what the game tells me they do, but the experience of using them makes me uncertain. Crucifixes are incredibly important on higher difficulties, but they have a very small protection radius. If the ghost is haunting a larger room, your results may vary. Take my friend, for instance, whose neck was unceremoniously snapped with a crucifix just outside of range.

Of course, depending on the ghost you face, some tools have additional uses. For the most part though, there are adjustments that need to be made. I imagine this will be fixed as more evidence types and ghosts are implemented.

The last big problem with this game is the learning process. I understand that keeping players in the dark is important for a horror game, but as a puzzle game, there is too much obfuscating. The journal needs a rework because flipping through every page is tedious right now. Imagine what it'll be like when there are more ghosts and tools. Give my index finger a rest!

So is Phasmophobia worth it despite these problems? Absolutely, and with it's recent success, I think we're going to see great things in its future.

I can't even watch Paranormal Activity without having to watch puppy videos for a good 30 minutes to an hour after a few minutes. But let me tell you - this game has made me into a man. I feel that this game can be a very metamorphic experience for people like me who can't stand horror-themed media. 

For starters, being able to bring your friends into the game to help face your fears is a great kind of crutch to help normally squeamish people through their fears. If you are too afraid to enter the game's various scare houses, there is always the option of staying in the van and helping by monitoring the ghost's activity and relaying information back to your team over the in-game radio. There's always a way to help your team and contribute to the main objective - finding out what kind of ghost you're dealing with.

In my opinion, the process of finding out what kind of ghost is haunting the house you've arrived at is the most enjoyable part of taking ghost hunting contracts in this game. You almost feel like a detective when you are flipping through the pages of your ghost hunter's journal, reading the descriptions of each kind of ghost.

You have to piece together all of the evidence and connect it with the different kinds of ghosts that exist in the game, and even though there is a concrete way of finding out which ghost there is through entering 3 types of evidence in a certain combination, the evidence is not always crystal-clear. Sometimes you have to think back on what the ghost did around your party members, how it reacted to certain items that you earn by playing the game and gathering money to afford more functional items that make more clear the full range of powers a ghost possesses. 

Eventually I found myself emboldened to make more brave decisions. I left the van and entered the house, whispering ""Mary Jackson, show us a sign..."" as I nervously tried to help my team find further evidence to pin down what kind of ghost was in each house. And yes, sometimes I did die screaming in horror after thinking I was safe in a closet or bedroom after having turned off my flashlight, but I eventually realized that is part of the fun. Even though I lost all the items I bought and only got a small amount of insurance money back from dying, I realized that this was part of the risk/reward system inherent in this game. There was a lot of time and effort put into the systems in this game, and I know that the developer will continue to work on the game and fix the various bugs (in my experience, there weren't nearly as many bugs present as in some other early access games) and improve the formula even further. I can strongly recommend this game to anyone, even if they are usually scared like I once was (and admittedly still kind of am).

53,Phasmophobia,76986272,english,"This game, (only being out for a few weeks at this time) is pretty solid. I personally skipped the training and dove in which provided for a much more exhilarating experience. The starter equipment provided helps with getting a grasp of the game and its mechanics. The objectives are clear and the evidence is easy to understand with only a few exceptions. As of now i am Level 12. With levels you can unlock different items but also maps. The maps you unlock come with greater difficulty and size. 

One thing i have trouble understanding is the Spirit Box for evidence. This item is probably one of the most difficult items about the game as its use is sometimes difficult to notice. Different events are supposed to ensue but on different occasions the results do not reflect the use of the Spirit Box whatsoever. Every-time the ghost has said something back it has worked, but other times it spawns a ghost event or flickers lights, you could argue that this is coincidental which is what i think aswell, but if this is the case it makes a round go for a lot longer than it has to if you cant decide to take Spirit Box for evidence or possibly die while continuing to look for the 3rd piece of evidence. 

Another issue is ""hunt mode"". Hunt mode is when a ghost will try to hunt and kill a player, (activity levels reach 10). I read somewhere you can hide in bathrooms and closets/lockers in order to avoid being killed. This may not be reliable but I've been killed through walls, doors and lockers/closets multiple times and am unsure if this is intended. The Crucifix is also a difficult item to understand because sometimes i get attacked through it but im not 100% it will block attacks every time. 

I do not recommend playing larger maps until you have a lot of money and/or items. (sanity pills are a must)

The game is new and at first its fun and exciting but the difficulty and activity of ghosts is rather low at Amateur and by that point you are hoping for something more after you've mastered the basics but the different difficulties to not apply to all maps unfortunately.

All in all a pretty stable game with minor inconveniences with great and refreshingly original content. : ) 

happy hunting lads.

55,Phasmophobia,76986093,english,"Spooky ghost game.
It reminds me of the TV shows I watched growing up: Ghost Hunters, Ghost Adventures, and such. This game is faster paced than I'd like. You want to get in and out ASAP, otherwise you risk getting hunted. An ""elusive"" difficulty/gamemode that has players trying to find out as much about the ghost would be great. Something like: your objective is to identify the ghost and gain as much info about it as possible. Is the ghost male or female? How old? When did they die? What/who killed them?
The kinds of questions you currently can ask in the game are simply to get activity, but the answers are meaningless and unused.
Once you put on your big boy/girl pants and go in there to get things done, this game is an enjoyable thriller. My two pet peeves are the weirdness with the shadows (your body does not cast shadows, but your hands do and the shadows are finnicky) and how the ghost can enter a hunt with no forewarning.

To clarify on the last point: the lights and flashlights do flicker for five seconds before the ghost starts moving, however, more buildup would be great. I was playing with friends and we were heading back to the ghost room when the ghost appeared in the doorway and a hunt immediately started. We had no indication that the ghost was going to be that active beforehand.

It's rare for a multiplayer game to achieve high levels of horror, but Phasmophobia accomplishes it in strides.

Backstory -  This game is being developed by one guy @DKighter and let's just say it is stunning to see a game that is developed by one guy be this popular. If you don't fully know what Phasmophobia is then let me explain it to you.

What is it? -  Phasmophobia is a VR and Non-VR 4 person co-op game where your goal is to provide evidence that there is supernatural activity in the location you chose. Whether or not you choose to go in the house or stay in the van the game is great none the less.

Why you should get it - You should get this game because it just starting out and there is already hours upon hours of content and the dev plans on adding a lot more as time goes on. Another reason is the price $13.99 is an amazing price for a game like this. At first I thought the game was kind of dumb, but then I actually started playing and started making lots of money on professional jobs and realized OMG I've needed his game my whole life.

I'm not much of a horror fan, especially when it comes to jumpscares - however, I have NOT been able to put this game down because all of the horror comes from the atmosphere. You can *feel* that the ghost does NOT want you there. I do wish the optimization were a little better, it hogs up 100% of my GPU in flatscreen and VR both, even when I'm not streaming. However, issues aside, the dev has been fantastic with the patches and adding a few little things here and there to keep the game fresh.

To summarize the gameplay loop, you show up at a house/school/asylum and you're trying to determine which one of the 10 different Ghost types is haunting it and GET OUT. Each time, the room in the building that the ghost ""haunts"" is randomized, so while the map selection is limited (I think about six or seven maps right now?) the game stays fresh because you never know exactly where it will be,, and each Ghost has distinct behavior patterns, strengths, and weaknesses. Think you're dealing with a Jinn? Cut the breaker. Maybe a Wraith? Line your surroundings with salt to keep it at bay. Banshee? Better keep that cross close. Demon? Just forget everything and get out.

1. It seems like more of a novelty at the moment, not something I can really get into
2. The controls on the index are...bordering shit. The hands are oriented in a way that feels less like they're your hands and more like they're those plastic hand sticks you'd find in a first grade classroom. Also rotation and movement have 2 separate bindings, the joysticks and the touchpads. If you try to rest your thumbs on the touchpads which is the natural resting place for them, you'll move/spin yourself around. Very disorienting at first until I figured out what was going on. Don't think there's any reason for it.
3. The graphics remind me a lot of some really clunky games like house flipper and thief simulator, and I'm not a fan of the art direction of either of those games. Could definitely use either another art pass or completely different direction because what's currently there isn't doing it for me at the moment. Also the leg IK on characters is really bad.

As for the gameplay itself, honestly I was impressed. I thought it would be pretty buggy, but during our whole first game it was stable and to be honest pretty terrifying. It's a scary game.

Overall, like 6/10. I do see a lot of potential and may come back to this game later. Graphics and controls take a lot away from the experience, but it's an early access game so expect it to be polished more as it get updates. I'd pick it up now if you're on the fence just because they say they'll raise the price on release and what's there is pretty good just unpolished.",1601745295,1601745424,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,141,12,43,43,43,1601714315,,

I was skeptical with the font image for the game title and the cheesy character graphics. I will say it adds charm to the game and comic relief from the horrifying adventures you are about to embark. As you prep for the game, buying  equipment, and shooting hoops with your friends. You will roll up in your surveillance van to the location of your ghost hunt. You see your objectives to figure out what type of spooky you have to find. You bring your journal and gear with your buddies to the front door. You have 5 minutes to laugh, talk smack to the ghost before you find yourself cowering in the restroom. Being locked in a room, seeing your breath, as your flashlight flickers, hoping that the ghost doesn't snap your neck or back in half. You try to get out but you have the ghost whispering in your headset that it know wants to get to know you. You find yourself screaming, ""NO! NO! NO!"" as you are trying to get out of the house again, guess what? The ghost is hunting, they locked the front door, and you missed your chance to hide in the closet because you kept asking dumb questions on the Ouija board. This ghost on the objective says it's responds to people who are alone. Then you have your buddy yelling at you from the van that they see the ghost and it's coming for you. 

Phasmophobia, re-playable, addicting, and I look forward to everything that's the come with this game. The cost of it is affordable and their discord response is on point for development.

22,Phasmophobia,76975167,english,"You are a ghost hunter. You aren't sure how you got here, you don't even particularly believe in ghosts, but you have always been skeptical and a couple of friends thought it would be fun to check out this ""haunted"" house. All you know is that you were told to bring a thermometer, and you have some cameras, a radio, an emf meter, and some flashlights. You also know the ghosts name is Michael Williams. Your team enters the dark log cabin, and spreads out scanning the house with various instruments, some people brave enough to speak ""Michael Williams, are you here?"", although maybe they aren't brave and just want to not hear every ambient sound. You enter a room and see your breath in front of you. It's cold. You crackle on your walkie talkie ""I need a thermometer on the first bedroom on the left upstairs!"" Your teammate arrives and tells you it is 2 degrees C. In a f*****g bedroom. It is ~20 C everywhere else. This is the place. Your team sets up in here, turning on EMF meters, radios, and a video recorder, and dropping them off in the room. People begin yelling ""Michael Williams! Are you here? Is there a spirit here?"" and suddenly the lights go off. You wish you had a flashlight, but there was only one regular flashlight and a dim purple UV light, and you were not one of the people that got one, and you didn't have the cash to buy one yourself. It's dark and for the first time there is pure fear. All you have is your teammates flashlights, and you can hear strange noises; heartbeats, footsteps,...was that a bang? You don't know what is teammates and what was a ghost. No one is yelling the name anymore. Suddenly, in the dim purple flashlight of your ally you can see a glowing purple hand when he flashes it at the window. Freezing temperatures and fingerprints. Someone checks the journal and finds it could be a wraith or a banshee, but you need to either get an EMF 5 signal or a spirit box response in order to narrow it down. Suddenly you hear some doors slam and the flashlights start flickering. The ghost is mad. The team starts to panic and run, and you hear the faint screams in proximity chat ""IT'S HERE! I SEE IT! AHHhhhhhhhhh...!"" You use your memory to fumble through the darkness back to the front door, but it is locked. You cower in the corner, powerless. After what feels like ages, a flashlight appears from a corner in steady light, and someone opens the door. You run back to the trailer acting as your home base and realized you have never felt more alive. You see a graph showing paranormal activity and you guys just reached a 10. Another graph shows you one of your team is dead. Unfortunately, you still have not narrowed down the ghost specifically, and you have to go back in and either get EMF or spirit box readings to have a chance at succeeding with any objectives. You could also take a camera and try to get a shot of it. You grab the camera and head back in. You go back to the room it all went down in and start yelling the name again, ""Michael Williams, Why are you mad?"" Suddenly, the EMF crackles to life, and you see fill bars. Banshee. You panic and decide that is enough, the picture isn't worth it, and start to leave. Suddenly the lights start flickering again and as you are leaving and look down a hallway, you see the banshee coming towards you and in a panic flash a picture, and begin screaming at the top of your lungs as you run towards the nearest exit. Locked again. The team is in panic, but the banshee targets one person, and you are it. You try to run, but you can't see, and you don't know where you are. You see an open closet, and hide in it. You want to ask what is happening, but your voice might give you away. You cower. Eventually, your team tells you it is over and the front door is open. You bolt, and make it to the HQ. You did not achieve all of the objective, and someone f*****g died, but you know what the ghost is, and better yet, you got a picture of it coming at you. You lock in your evidence of the ghost and decide to get the hell out of dodge. Mission successful, and for all that effort you got a measly $60. But you have never felt more alive. 

This game has more ambiance and adrenaline in its pinkie finger than any other game in the last 20 years. It harkens back to the horror of fatal frame and silent hill, but with the team of Left 4 Dead, and a bit of puzzle of a Sherlock Holmes game. But one of the coolest features is the use of sound. The game records you, and you WILL have to speak and be interactive with the game to succeed. It recognizes you saying the name of the ghost, and that will be apparent. The proximity and walkie talkie chat are phenomenal as well. There are I believe 13 types of ghosts you can find, which leads to an incredible amount of replayability as even if you did the same map over and over it is unlikely you would get the same ghost more than once. I have only played a few hours, and I am a little afraid to play more, but I have never had such an emotional experience in a game since my childhood. If you are even remotely interested in feeling your heart beat, this game is worth the $14 price tag. That is the price of a movie, and playing this game for an hour even without VR (which it supports) will get your heart beating faster than any scary movie you have ever seen. I don't really recommend games. You can check my history and see that. [b]I recommend this game.[b]",1601740330,1601740330,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,177,6,1204,1204,148,1602035282,,

28,Phasmophobia,76974971,english,"This is one of those games that has the potential to be much better than its current state.  It's got REALLY good ideas that could be executed way better.

- VR controls were made specifically with the Vive controller in mind.  Not only can VR controls NOT be remapped, but also using controllers for the Index or other peripherals results in jankiness.

- Teleport movement in VR feels janky as well; you're practically forced to use smooth motion for a playable experience.  This is the only VR game I've played where I started feeling motion sickness.  Not sure what the difference is between this title and, say, Rec Room or HL: Alyx, but the difference is there.

- You can't jump into a game with others until you've completed Training mode, which wouldn't be a bad thing if the training mode did a better job of explaining what needs to be done and how to do it.  The slideshow tutorial helps, but it needs to be improved.

- On the topic of the Training mode, the game doesn't seem entirely certain on whether it even wants to allow you to complete it.  Half the time I was in Training, It felt like a toss-up as to whether three pieces of ghost-hunting equipment were actually going to work.  In the end, only two of the tools actually gave me some results and I quit out of frustration.  When I started the game again, it somehow decided that not only had I completed the Training mode, but also successfully guessed which type of ghost was in the house (I hadn't guessed at all).

- The ""Five minute time limit"" feels more like a gentle suggestion than anything else; I only realized that time had finished counting down when the ghost had started getting ornery after TWICE that amount of time had passed.

I can't recommend this game to people in its current state.  I hope the devs give this title the time, polish and improvement that it dearly needs, because it's still based on some great ideas and I'm interested in seeing what they do with it.",1601740053,1601740053,FALSE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,303,7,96,96,96,1601695453,,

Gone Home but this time, there's a ghost! One of the most original co-op games, atmospheric, investigative. Pour yourself a good drink, sit down with your friends at night and investigate a location together in an interactive version of haunted house.

(+) Can be played in a single player
(+) Private and public lobbies
(+) VR not necessary
(+) Many original mechanics, focused on investigating, fitting mechanic of door-opening
(+) Engaging progression: you make money to buy more equipment for bigger cases
(+) So much potential to expand this game
(+) Price

(-) Awkward manipulation with some tools (rotating a dslr camera, for example)
(-) Probably all buttons on keyboard and mouse can be mapped. Some have weird names (extra buttons on a mosue) but work, some have correct label but don't work properly (flashlight on mouse middle button was not working to turn on flashlight)
(-) Tutorial is very basic, generally a short guide for each investigation tool would be great to have on a press of a button (F1 to explain what I'm holding and how to use it correctly)

it has:
✔ Good graphics
✔ Thrilling Gameplay
✔ Amazing ghost hunter items
✔ Enjoyable Teamplay Games

its still early access so some ingame bugs may occur, but its playable.
some of features that this games need:
❌ Voice chat supression
❌ voice chat sign (whos talking)
❌ More maps
❌ More powerful ghost AI, maybe a harder difficulty
❌ Change hosts feature
❌ Easier hold to add more item (so we dont have to click 1000000x to buy all items)
❌ Bug fix  : Ghost are sometimes buggy, like jinn turning off the lamp doesnt make sense. Banshee that step on the salt but no footprints, killing outside house area (house map). some map bugs that ghost cannot chase u when u r on top of a bed. Not showing temp, orbs, etc in the ghost spawn area.
❌ more question to ouija board, except where are u n how old are you (yes no question maybe)

But overall this game is very good, i really enjoy playing it

The environment is stunning, thematic and atmospheric that helps enhance the gameplay by instilling a genuine feel of terror and horror in your heart.

   This game keeps you on your toes with fantastic audio and sound design that only helps in improving the experience as you can tell where the footsteps are, object movements, whispers, doors closing and many small things that the game developers spent time on making to deliver an astonishing experience. The map design is perfect and well constructed as it perfectly mimics places where ghosts are found, such as houses, farms, schools and asylums. It perfectly captures the experience of ghost hunting as there're no cheap jumpscares, or scares in general, that cheapens the experience, while making everything feels like a legitimate ghost hunting experience.

Making it one of the best horror games I have ever tried!

Even in early access, this game is one of the most completed early access version I have yet to try.

FEEDBACK:
- Add in different player strengths and weaknesses to characters so everyone has a part to play in it (but maybe don't allow 2 or more of the same character types to be selected as to overpower one strength?)
- Add in a revive player system but make it expensive or challenging
- Add in a points system for players who do the most work lol
- Add in steam achievements

PROS:
- Fun game to play especially with friends
- Nice variety of locations as you level up and a variety of ghosts
- Nice variety of tools to help you identify which ghost it could be
- The more you play the more you learn the more fun it becomes

CONS:
- Limitation to how many items you can carry

49,Phasmophobia,76962254,english,"  I recommend this game to be played in VR.  It can be a little clunky and sometimes you get some FPS drops here and there but nothing too bad.  The atmosphere is great, I don't believe in the paranormal and think all the shows are a complete hoax, but its October and Halloween is coming up and its nice to see a VR horror game that actually gives me chills and a long feeling of dread, of course its in early access and needs cleaning up, there are a few things to bug me.

  Please remove or replace the level system and just have money, this has caused people to become very elitist to the point that they will kick anyone under a certain level, this penalizes anyone trying to get better at the game (This game works great with 2-3 People), forcing them to solo play which is extremely tedious and mostly pointless if your goal is to progress (unless you continuously farm the same level over and over).  I understand not having a lot of room for items because Co-op, but if you are stuck in a situation where solo play is the only way to go, 2 items on belt and 2 in hand, isn't very effective (For flat screeners, for VR you can turn on things and leave them on your belt).  

Overall, the level system has created a prejudice and people are kicked for it and not given a chance at either learning about the game through mechanics/gameplay or being able to progress.

If you are coming to this game, please bring friends along, you will have a fantastic experience because good luck trying to get into a server without getting kicked. Good fucking luck.

68,Phasmophobia,76960122,english,"I absolutely love this game, the atmosphere relies on itself and the ghost you're attempting to hunt solely. I would say there's no jumpscares in this game as every sound and noise in the game is result of audio ques before something truly happens. In VR the immersion is entirely there especially when you play with other friends who are in VR, it controls much better in VR than desktop and is overall better quality of life. Equipment on your belt stays on and active such as EMF and Ghost box electronics. 

As far as what I want to see in this game, I would enjoy a consistent working voice chat, stable servers, desktop players being capable of placing stuff down rather than throwing stuff by looking down and pressing G (candles and other equipment can't be precisely placed at the moment), preferably a Peer to Peer option or just overall stronger dedicated server rooms. Past technical options, gameplay wise I would love to see harder ways to interact with the ghost. On higher difficulties the name of the ghost should be concealed and you should be encouraged to use Ouija boards to get its name at the cost of sanity to get activity from it. I would also like to see larger maps include multiple ghost types active at once but far separate from each other. More unique optional objectives and evidence would be great too!

This game for an early access and unity has been the greatest horror experience I've truly enjoyed. I hope the developer continues to add amazing content such as new ghost types and maps down the line as long as harder to achieve evidence and objective goals while also improving Ai and models. Please do yourself a favor and try this game as I haven't been disappointed yet!

The core mechanics of the game is great and fun to play.

Each ghost has a unique combination of evidence that satisfies this objective. Once completed, players leave the location and receive payment for their accomplishments.

It's still in Early Access, so there are still a lot of bugs to work out. The tools used to accomplish evidence-gathering can sometimes be bugged (such as the ghost writing book or spirit box refusing to operate, or the ghost orb floating outside of the map), which can lead to frustration.

Without all of the excruciating possessions, deaths, and real life shattering experiences caused by Demons and the like, of course.
 
Try it out a bit more. You'll learn to get into the mood of your job. Want to be the guy that watches after the team and makes sure they're aware of all events gone unnoticed? Stay at the truck and play as the Nerve Center tech. 
Want to piss off an apparition? Taunt it all you want through local voice chat and have your fun as a 3 man hunter team.
Don't care about Nerve Center? Fine, make it a 4 man hunter team and grab all your gear. 
Want to troll your friends while no one is watching and just start slamming all the doors only to blame it on the ghost? Your call.

The ghosts are spooky and it really makes you fill like you're there. The ghost can interact with the environment and even speak to you through the game. The game features voice recognition so you can ask the ghosts things like: ""Where are you?"" or ""How old are you?"". Sometimes the ghosts respond with nice or sometimes malicious comments. One time I got the response: ""Death!"" which let me tell you, that made my heart drop like a rock. On the negative side of things (these are probably because of my below-average internet speed and computer) the game crashed several times. At one point my graphics driver failed completely. The voice chat works nice, although if you don't have a decent quality mic you will probably be kicked from most servers.

If you have a decent computer, try the game. If you don't like it get a refund, simple as that.

Unlike a great deal many indie horror games, Phasmophobia is not only terrifying but also a deep game with high replayability. You can play in regular desktop mode, or, if you're looking to really get spooked, it works pretty well in VR too. For an early access game, Phasmophobia is quite a bit solid already. The dev team seem to have their finger on the pulse as far as bugfixes and whatnot are concerned as well.

There are a good amount of videos on Youtube you can watch to kind of get a feel for the ins and outs of the game, but its main thrust is this: you are a team of paranormal investigators who go and gather evidence of malevolent spirits. You can use several tools at your disposal to gather clues and to narrow down the ghost you are dealing with, including an EMF detector, a thermometer to measure cold spots, a book for the ghost to write in, a device that allows ghosts to speak through it when you ask it questions, and many more. You can speak the ghost's name to get a reaction out of it, but the results are not for the faint of heart.

At present there are 12 kinds of ghosts you can encounter, and no one haunting is the same. You also have access to all kinds of venues like your run-of-the-mill suburban house, a farmhouse, a high school, and even an asylum. 

Be careful when traversing the locations in the dark, as your sanity meter can drop and thus leave you open to attacks from the spirit. If you notice your flashlight starts blinking, or you hear your heart beating, find a room or closet, hide, and don't make a fucking sound.

My only complaint is the proximity and global chat. Under normal circumstances, it works great, and lends to some great gameplay moments, but sometimes it bugs out and you can't hear your teammates talking. Other than that, Phasmophobia is a rock-solid, pants-wetting experience and perfect for celebrating October.",1601709057,1601709174,TRUE,1,0,0.532163739,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,61,3,397,397,212,1601877333,,

put Simply, you are a paranormal Investigator with upto 3 other players trying to collect evidence in 'dangerously' Haunted houses trying to figure what 'type' of ghost is within the location.
At the moment there are about 10 different ghosts each with their own personalities, one will relentless hunt one person, one will only attack someone who is alone, others attack more frequently while the lights are off.

one of the more interesting aspects of the game interacts with your microphone as well, not only is it used to communicate with other players but also with the game itself, the Ghost can hear you, and if it does it may just respond for better or worse... helping you with clues... or will listen out for anything you may say while you hide in a closet, this can also be used to fight it though as any players outside the house could continue to taunt it to draw it away from those in danger.

To complicate matters further, you have to deal with the map... which can have it's own series of challenges in trying to collect credible evidence and not getting lost.
at the moment there are about 7 maps (3 street houses, 2 cabin in the woods, 1 abandoned high school and 1 asylum) 
It's reported there are more maps on the way.

The other players you work with also add random element as they can be to your benefit or to your bane...
for the most part you get players who are helpful good team players who you need to rely on to get the job done but the player community is not without: new players who don't know what they are doing or who are too scared to enter the house, or taunt needlessly (both the ghost and players), and then there are players who can take it to a whole new level of trolling while you are feeling at your most vulnerable.
This isn't strictly speaking the fault of the game, but one can't help in wondering it wasn't encouraged on some level on it's development where you can take the remote for the TV or the Car and activate it as a player wanders past it.

The game has its share of glitches which the developer has shown to be working on fixing. for the most part they are few and far between, but can happen.

You also have a level progression system but you do pretty much unlock everything by level 10, I feel like it needs something for the later levels or possibly more difficulty levels where you get a place with two ghosts or something...

Speaking as a player who'd like to reach out to the developer, I'd like to see a more broader range of Difficulty options, perhaps a 'random' difficulty setting where players don't know what the setup time is or even a possibility the house isn't haunted at all... this does happen alot in real life ghost hunting after all, and will constantly leave the players guessing... to expand on that further you could have a 'fake ghost' to which the owner had planted a series of bugs and sound devices to trick players into thinking there is a ghost when there really isn't. and finally i think it would be good if at least one of the ghosts were able to step outside the confines of the house and possibly visit them in the truck (you may want to put a cabinet in there for them to hide in if you do that though)
 but that's just my two cents worth of ideas.

My reasons:
- You lose your stuff no matter what. (Even if your friends take your equipment you bought to the truck, you lose it. Period). Making it impossible for you to progress because the game will ask you to bring key things in order to complete a certain mission, but, it costs money and sometimes too much money.
- The VR part of the game is quite clunky and probably the worst thing I've ever seen. Hopefully they'll fix it, which I'm sure they will.
- In Non VR the game is still clunky with how it still feels like you are playing in VR. You have to hold onto doors in order to open them.

Not only does the voice recognition not work on Windows 7 at all, it has MAJOR problems working on Windows 10 as well. There's no way to properly play the game with this feature not working. My friend with a Valve Index also couldn't get VR working. He was able to play the tutorial once and said it was so terribly implemented that he was switching to non-VR mode.

Seems like a good concept, but the game is unplayable if you can't get the voice recognition to work. The developer has stated in comments that they're working on getting some sort of patch for Windows 7 users, but even their ideas to work around this problem are crippling the way the game is meant to be played.

The 'ghost room' also seems arbitrary as activity will occur anywhere, at any time, with any number of people around.  In the end, this game still has huge potential, but it has a very long road ahead to reach it.

A ghost hunting game that actually feels like a ghost hunting game? Check. 

Walk around the location finding evidence of the paranormal using your tools, all the while trying not to die. 

I love that it clearly took some inspiration from games like Left 4 Dead and Payday. 
The ghosts you are tracking are randomised, making your tools all the more important. 
The location of the power box is also randomised, it's important to know where this is because the ghost will mess with it. 
Jobs appear on a map which are also randomised, as well as details about the jobs such as objectives, the name of the ghost and how it will interact with people. 
Making this game a unique experience each time you play it. It's always a question of how many objectives you can complete in time, or will I die a horrible death?

a fantastic ghost hunting game with lots of tools to play with and a so much replay value.

The VR functionality is great and not just a crappy tack on, it actually functions well as a VR game and I really appreciate the cross play with non-VR folks. 

I love the RNG of the game, it seems that each ghost hunt pulls randomly from a list of objectives and can swap out the type of ghost in the levels as well. and you never really know if the gadget or tool you are using is effective. its like you are solving a mystery by trying to figure out what type of ghost you are dealing with, getting your evidence and getting the hell out of there to get paid so you can buy more and better equipment for your next hunt.

It is more than capable of suckerpunching you with a scare or even death even if you are popping jokes with friends. The chances of which increasing in likeliness the further into the haunt that you go, don't hesitate to leave with what you've got if you can.  

Preparation is Key, even the timing of when you do things is key. Your sanity is incredibly fragile, in which ghosts will prey on from actual encounters to just being in the dark.  If you've got solid teamwork going, you can nail what kind of ghost it is before anything too insane happens. If you're too late on the draw, you won't even be able to enter the house without the risk of imminent death.

Well done atmosphere, especially the in game radio sound effects for voice chat. It really enhances the experience and adds to the suspense, especially when your radio suddenly goes out or a friends does. Do you bolt it and run, or go grab their stuff? :blobscared:

The gameplay experience consists of searching the house for evidence of what type of ghost is haunting the area. Things such as paranormal events, using salt to find footprints, etc. There is some pretty good variety in the levels so far. A school, old farmhouse, some nice suburban homes. 

As it is in early access, game is a bit shallow in certain areas like not a large amount of objectives, and you could use some more ghost hunting equipment.

There are a few cons, which are to be expected with the beta version:

The lobby rooms keep the same name as the creator of the lobby, even if that person leaves, making it difficult for potential friends to join up to those rooms.

There aren't a lot of location varieties at this point. While the game diversifies the ghosts locations/types/personalities enough to make it not FEEL repetitive, it would be nice to not know the full layout of each house every time after a few play-thrus. The larger locations are also quite overwhelming and since there is no reward-incentive to encourage players to play these locations, they are not played through often enough.

Will you stay back in the car watching a camera you placed? Will you yell its name and piss it off?

I'll also comment on the animations with the ghosts, its scary but, it feels like something out of an IOS game and id be more scary if the ghost was coded to face a player in the room because sometimes a ghost will spawn in and just being staring at a wall. Another thing is it'd be cool if the ghosts themselves could interact with more things like for example what if in the high school the ghost turned on the high school bell or flushed a toilet or used the schools or building intercom then you hear this ear wrenching static and when the ghost threw stuff us being able to hear breaking plates in the kitchen or a cabinet fall in the basement.

[b]Some tips:[/b]

Press T (when you have a flashlight) to use your flashlight while holding a different item. You can use the UV light and the flashlight at the same time.

Press F to do an alternative action (like placing the camera). It's sad, but that one took me a minute.

The first thing you'll probably want to invest in as a group is more flashlights. Can't be hunting what you can't see!

You can use spraycans for the hoop in the lobby. Nothing happens at 100 hoops (sadly).

Hide in closets, bathrooms or lockers when your heart beats loudly and the lights flicker (when the ghost is hunting / activity level 10). During 10, the radio will not work and the people inside the truck can't hear you. The doors will also lock.

When hiding, keep quiet even outside of push to talk. If it hears you, it might still kill you. (They can open doors, remember?)

If you can't hide (some locations don't really have an option) you can kite most ghosts around obstacles. Not all, but most.

Always keep a general idea of where the power box is in case you need to flip the switch.

The lower your sanity = the greater chance a ghost will attack you. You can use this to lure the ghost into giving you evidence by using someone as bait.

The ghost can hear you whether or not you use push to talk. It is always listening. Be wise.

Don't name drop the ghost (taunting it) unless you are ready to deal with the consequences. It's natural to want to go in screaming it's name (and I've done this), but you're better off finding out where it is and have a game plan before you go into caveman mode. 

The flakiest evidence in my experience are ghost orbs (because they are hard to catch) and freezing temperatures (I've had ghosts that were supposed to freeze and never did). You'll get annoyed sometimes, it happens. Hopefully they work on this.

General working strategy I've found (when you have 4 friends) is to go in with the EMF, Spirit Box, UV Light, and Temp working in various hands to narrow down where the ghost is inside the house. EMF and Temp are the ones that generally work the fastest. Once you find one evidence, you'll probably find more in that location. Listen for cues like phones, pianos, footsteps, ect. The ghost will make noise even when the activity is low.

Once you isolate it, go back to the truck and get the book and video camera and place them in the haunted area on the floor or table. Have the book in view of the video camera so you can know if the ghost decides to write you poetry. If you have salt, lay it in doorways and walkways. Use the UV near the salt to track footprints. Have someone watch the vid camera in the truck for ghost orbs. Drop the spirit box in that area to keep it going in case the ghost is feeling chatty. Keep an ear for the spirit box at all times. Walk around with the EMF, Temp, and UV Light to narrow down the ghost's exact position, track it's movements, or narrow down evidence.

Once you collect two confirmed evidence, you can usually narrow down the ghost to 2 options inside your journal. Use process of elimination in regards to the evidence--it will be your friend, and help you solve the puzzle as quickly as possible. You don't need to memorize, just keep track of your journal.

I don't really get spooked much by horror games often but this game really creeps me out O.O

Now, obviously I know and respect that its still very new and in Early Access and so its definitely not perfected yet. I hear its all just one person developing it as well and its really good so far so I'm definitely impressed!

However here is sum feedback/ideas on the game so far:
- It's iffy with items occasionally missing from in game like even after adding them in, also with sum items not always showing up on the list for everyone in the lobby correctly.
- It's iffy where you use a crucifix or photo camera to defend against the ghost but it doesn't always actually affect it and so people end up dying anyways even if you did the right things.
- Sum times it changes host for like no reason after a match. 
- I think it'd be a good idea to have all lower levels/smaller maps still available to the higher levels as I'm sure there are people who might play this with only 2-3 people (maybe even alone.. Them crazy hoes!) or in general not want to do the bigger maps.
- I think it'd be a good idea to have it so that when you first start playing the game and are low level you at least won't lose any or all of your items when you die till you reach a higher level.
- Also I could be wrong but the insurance seems a bit buggy because there have been quite a few times where I lost all my items after dying and I didn't get any money back at all yet other times I have, so I was kinda screwed over by that which admittedly frustrated me a lil bit.
- I also think that the ghosts and their ""behaviours"" or ""personalities"" need to be more polished, for example I had a wraith earlier and wraiths don't show footsteps yet it did with the salt (I could be misunderstanding this tho and I will double check and correct my mistake if I am wrong, but I am pretty certain I'm not wrong).

This game was obviously made for VR and thats not a bad thing however it would be a bad thing if VR users get a leg up on the rest of us as they might be able to hold more stuffs at the same time, I think this is a tad bit unfair (but its not too bad tho like I get it). However I could also be wrong as this is just what I've heard from others so I will happily correct this if I am wrong.

The Devs seem to update it quite frequently which is nice!
I'm incredibly excited to see whats in store for this game in the future and I believe in the potential of this game :D

Suggestions:

I like the idea of making small changes to ghost behavior on a regular basis and not letting anyone know.  I think this would help keep people on their toes as the game ages/the player base gets more experienced.

Multiple ghosts on the bigger maps would be sweet as well. (maybe even on the smaller maps from time to time?)

Bigger maps need more sounds.  When you go in a house, there are always creaks and squeaks.  The larger maps sound less lively by comparison.

More varied death animations and intensity based off of ghost type.  Maybe animations that match the ghost.  (axe ghost axe-murders you, demon babies eat you from the feet up, fast ghosts quickly brutalize you, etc....)

I'm still trying to wrap my head around the fact that this is made with such basic tools and does more, so much more than any other horror game out there.

Also, if you don't like to talk on a mic this game is not for you, communication is the key to survive this game and coordinate with the other players, also you need it to talk to the actual ghosts.

Random people in online play all have been really nice and so far the games have been fun as hell, specially with the VR players looking wonky as fuck but they are a huge help because they can do more  with their belt to hold items.

Important Tips for Newcomers (Especially in VR)

-Find the ghost room first (It may not even be a bedroom, but rather a basement, attic, or living room). Thermometers, EMF Detectors, Spirit Boxes, and strange activity like books falling over are all indicators of the ghost room.

-Your journal is on your right shoulder. Articles say it is behind your right shoulder, but in my experience it is always on the front surface of your right shoulder adjacent to your nipple. 

-Thermometers are extremely helpful, EMF readers don't always give an indication of where the ghost room is. If you enter a room that is drastically colder (It doesn't have to be freezing and usually never is) then you found the ghost room.

-Your Walkie Talkie is on your left shoulder, everybody on the map can hear you while you hold it down.

-Don't call out the ghost's name until you want it to become aggressive, stick to more general questions until then.

-Don't be afraid to ask a high level, ""What does this do?"" half of what I've learned has come from more experienced players.

-Lastly, and most importantly, VR Players can lock other players inside of rooms by grabbing the door handle and holding it shut.",1601650331,1601650481,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,104,6,718,718,470,1601699958,,

I honestly don't remember how I came across this game on Steam but I'd been looking for a good co-op horror game that I wouldn't get distracted just building in, as I usually cross it with the survival genre.  I looked up some videos of it on YouTube and knew immediately that I would shit bricks if I played it.

But... after a day or two of ultimately circling back to watch videos of it... I decided to put on my adult pants and try it with one of my co-op buddies.  I have zero regrets, other than the random nightmares and escalating power bill from keeping the entire floor's lights on at night.

A lot of reviews already phrase this game's appeal well: it's the fill for the niche that has been hollow for too long.  The game doesn't bank on GPU-breaking graphics to hide watered-down gameplay or intense cinematic cutscenes for flashy jumpscares--the horror is through the atmosphere and the tension, with just the right build-up to any form of jumpscare.  You jumpscare yourself just from basic interactions because of the immersion you find yourself lost in, that by the time the ghost you are hunting DOES appear, it's the anticipation YOU have created in your own mind that makes it a jumpscare more than anything.

I keep coming back to this, I watch streams in my downtime--simply because every round is unique.  The appeal is in watching what others do when the flight instinct kicks in, which makes it very humorous to watch.  Despite not having some vast double-digit number of maps or supplies, each round will always be different.  You can learn the maps all you want, you're still going to get fucked as the difficulty levels are unlocked.  Being too aggressive or even too slow is punishing but not unforgiving, and seeing how fast the few devs that run it have put out bug fixes, you're rarely going to die due to a glitch--only your own mistakes.

The devs have been extremely open-book with the booming community, the transparency as to what they want to add, what they're working on, listening to feedback and asking for suggestions from those who love the game to help form the future of it.  And the community is hyped to help, as well as being one of the nicest gaming communities I've ever had the pleasure of perusing on Discord.  Even the memes are lit.

Phasmophobia is genuinely a gem that was muchly needed in this genre.  I actively look forward to its future.",1601649929,1601649929,TRUE,2,0,0.545454562,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,65,5,2870,2870,1540,1602037430,,

44,Phasmophobia,76914677,english,"I saw streamers were playing this game on Twitch and I didn't even know what this game was, well I didn't watch them play it cause I didn't want any spoilers so I stayed away.   A couple weeks later I decided to go onto steam and check this game out for myself and see what it was all about.  I saw the screen shots and didn't really watch the trailer cause, again, spoilers.   I wanted to play this game in VR cause I'm getting a new VR headset soon, but I said screw it and bought the game.   At first a couple times I didn't even know how this game played, but soon I got to know it better.   This game isn't like any other indie horror you'd find with cheap jump scares that just pop out at you and try to make you jump.  This game literally has a computer AI that knows where you are at all times and if angered will attack you.  This game has Voice Recognition so, the game knows you're talking to it and will respond accordingly to what your'e saying.   It's very creepy cause the Ghost knows who you are.  Not a lot of horror games do this and they just focus on making you jump constantly without any real suspension, and build up to the fear aspect.  This game does a real good job of making you feel afraid and want to get out.  With the Spirit box, you can ask the Ghost where they are, how old are they, basically anything and they will respond some of the times.   Not every ghost will respond to you.  It seems like everything is random for events.  The Developer is only 1 man working on this game with constant updates to make his game a lot better for his community, unlike most Developers who could care less about their people and just give up on their game and leave it to die off.  I 100% recommend to those who want a real horror game with actual fear aspect to it, and not some BS pop in your face multiple times garbage.  For the price it's at, it's definitely worth your money. It is Early Access, so expect bugs and weird things that shouldn't be there. But again, the Dev is constantly working on updates for a much better experience.  I kid you not, you will find this game scary, even to the gamer's that know what is and is not scary will get scared.",1601649581,1601649581,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,156,63,997,997,784,1602030666,,

I still continue to play and look forward to the future updates of this title.

Pros:
* Good core gameplay loop
* Progression, the game gets harder as you get more experienced and you can afford better tools to help you on your endevors
* Easily able to develop future maps and ghosts as the game feels very modular in the sense that all of the game play revolves around 1 map + 1 ghost that can be interchanged.

Cons. nit picking:
* The proximity and radio chat is good addition to the game, however it needs some more development as mic quality drops significantly compared to using something like discord and it's clear that data packets get lost on transmission.
* Animations, probably the most rough looking part of the game is the animations of characters and their models, this is something that's secondary to the core gameplay and can be improved at a later date.

We also realized that you only get 10$ for some of the houses based on what you do. We have now begun to steal from the houses.

64,Phasmophobia,76899358,english,"This game is really fun, but it depends on the group you are with. Finding those groups is the issue. There is no automatic matchmaking, so it is best played with friends. When playing with random people, you may have to spend some time looking for a full lobby with people actually using their microphones. That in itself is hard. Also, if you are just starting out, finding lobbies with lower level hosts can be difficult too. 

Animations could use some work too. While they are comedic with their Chinese contortionist shet, it takes away from the immersive atmosphere. Also, pressing shift to run is more like pressing shift to slightly walk faster. While I can understand the horror aspect of having an unstoppable force chase you in either a small or a gigantic map, I am pretty sure that the majority of people find it inconvenient or frustrating how slow the pace is. It is funny though.

It would also be helpful to have name tags or something, not like the ones that float above your head but maybe a sticker on each character's shirt or something instead to make communication easier. 

When hiding or just opening doors in general, I think it would be best to have it just one click to open and close because many people struggle at first with dragging it open and still do especially when panicking and frantically trying to open the door lol. 

When it comes to equipment slots, I think that there should be a display. With the microphones, an optional display for how loud your voice is in game would be helpful too. Pricing wise for tools, I think it should be reworked because it looks heavily inflated. $15 for a candle. It better be from Bath & Bodyworks, haha. Perhaps dowsing rods could be added too. Just a few minor notes. 

The graphics in this game are pretty good. There are many options for shadows and reflections. The props and objects are very detailed. The mirrors however, do not reflect. In the base, I think it could use a little more trees and houses to make it feel more like a neighborhood. Slightly clipping through the truck and the plywood walls, you can see how it induces kenophobia. Perhaps having a physical store neaby so you can leave the base would be more immersive. There could be more physics with character models too. Clothes moving, shading, blinking, visual representation of losing sanity, etc. Changeable and or seasonal attire would be a great way to add more character to the game as well as receive more support and funding for development.

Overall, I love the direction this game is going because it is very unique, but needs quite some more polishing. I hope the developers read and consider what I have to say, and I cannot wait for the next installment. Good luck.

-atmosphere and sfx really kick up the immersion. sometimes ill be scared out of my mind just from the noises without actually seeing the ghost.
-There is a ton of potential for future game modes.
-push to talk actually immerses you more in the game
-its extremely fun and the amount of players or lack thereof actually directly effect how scared you feel.
-devs hard at work updating this game every single day. sometimes twice a day.

Cons: -Is the scariest game I've ever played
-it is VEEERRRYYY early access. lots of bugs.
-frequent disconnects
-game objective seems to contradict itself. Like you get more money from taking pictures of evidence items more than you do searching for an actual ghost. more like get in, find evidence, take pictures leave. there have been multiple times where we dont even so much as hear a ghost before we collect all of our evidence.
-after about 12 hours, it seems to just get repetitive.

28,Phasmophobia,76895744,english,"TL;DR - Great game, pretty simple at this point but should still provide hours of fun with a semi-randomized location and ghost each round. A good experience for folks (like me) who love horror, but are easily spooked. Provides a unique balance of investigative mechanics with moments of intense peril. While there are definitely some issues with the game, it's in early access and many of the flaws add to the charm. Give this one a shot and support the devs!

Having written only 1 other review (for a community badge) after a decade of buying games on Steam, believe me when I say this one is worth every penny of its $13.99 price tag. It's an absolute to blast and an extremely innovative take on the survival(?) horror genre. If you're like me and spook easy, but love to be scared, this is the game for you. While there is definitely a survival component, your goal is to observe, record, and identify various types of dangerous spirits that haunt a variety of classic found footage and ghost hunt locales.

[h1]The Good[/h1]
- Dislike spending the whole game running for your life, but love horror/the occult/found footage? Spend your time running tests and deducing what is haunting that house! You have variety of tools and items at your disposal such as EMF readers, night vision cameras, thermometers, spirit boxes, etc.
- Get spooked? Head back to your trusty ghost hunting van and take a breather. Check the cameras for ghost orbs, monitor the ghost activity readings, guide your friends around with the digital map. It's great to have a safe zone to cool off after you've seen a bloody infant charging out of the master bedroom at you. 
- The atmosphere of this game is incredible. While there are still jump scares, 90% of the horror is the incredible tension building: lights flicker, doors close on their own, objects are thrown across the room, spirits will talk and interact with your group. 
- Speaking of talking... the voice recognition component may sound super cheesy, but it's an awesome part of the experience. Getting a response to certain phrases is super unnerving and you can pretend like you totally aren't ******** yourself while howling ""Doooooorooothy Joohnsoon, wheeerree are youuuu?!"". Everyone will think you're super macho and Dorothy will appreciate your concern.
- This game has barely been out for 2 weeks, it's still in early access. While I've always been wary of the whole ""buy before it's ready"" concept, this the first time I've genuinely felt that the cost of the game will definitely be put right back into it. If it's this fun already, I can't imagine how great it will be with even more polish and QoL improvements.

[h1]The Neutral[/h1]
- On the topic of polish, the character models for your ghost hunting crew are laughably bad. Any time you bend over or look upwards you're basically bending 180 degrees at the waist and rushing head or pelvis first into whichever direction you're heading. While some will probably say it's ""immersion breaking"", it adds to the charm at this point and the comedic relief is often appreciated after a particularly stressful ghost event. 
- Currently, the only game type is to ""identify"" the ghost. You go in, figure out where the ghost is, what it responds to, capture some evidence, and get the heck out. It's fairly straightforward, but with a random ghost type spawning each round you'll definitely be kept on your toes for awhile. Additionally, the locations seem fairly limited at this point, but again the random ghost and randomized ""haunt"" room make each round feel unique and just as terrifying as previous rounds.
- This game can be played both in VR and on a regular desktop. However, it seems like VR players definitely get an edge by being able to turn on certain tools, like EMF readers, and clip them to their belts to operate them hands free. While this an obvious disadvantage for desktop players, it's great that the game is adding cool details for VR (though I'm a desktop player and not certain I could handle VR).

[h1]The Not so Good[/h1]
- I hate to say bad, the game is in early access and the devs are clearly working to improve things. The tutorial for the game isn't great. While you're given an introduction to a few of the basic tools, it doesn't cover many of them and often times the correct way to use a tool isn't super obvious (looking at you smudge sticks). You'll probably want to read some guides after completely the tutorial, without going to far as to spoil the experience of learning the ghost hunting mechanics. It's a difficult balance that I hope the devs will be able to sort out soon.
- On the same note, many of the mechanics are pretty unclear at this point, but the devs have been very open and helpful in figuring out how things work and explaining how they plan to improve on things in the future. 
- I'm not sure this game would be great alone. While I'm certain some out there will enjoy the high intensity of being alone in the dark with a murderous ghost, the vast majority of my fun has coming from being in group and working together to solve the mystery of the unidentified ghost.

76,Phasmophobia,76893775,english,"Absolutely goddamn in love with this game. I'm slightly (very) biased, I love ghost lore and have hunted them back in college.

So you're hunting ghosts, not removing them. Some unlucky bastards get to actually banish the thing you riled up, and possibly fed, afterwards. There is a selection of different maps that your team can investigate, several houses of varying sizes, and larger facilities like a high school and, best of all, an abandoned insane asylum.

You outfit your guys with equipment like flashlights, video and still cameras, thermometers, and eventually motion sensors or head-mounted Go-Pro style cameras. Those are the best for creating found footage movie action at somebody's expense. There's a short window wherein the ghost cannot harm you and you need to find its location and evidence to identity it.

Welcome to hell, people.

The game doesn't rely on jump scares, the ghost isn't regularly jumping out in your face and screaming. It's all tension in the dark. Wandering around, trying to coordinate with your team and watching for signs of the haunting; taps being run, doors slamming, car alarms and radios going off. Once you've found the central hotspot you need to figure out what you're dealing with; in the houses this can be fairly easy. Enjoy the multiple floors and many, many rooms in the larger sites.

Voice communications are required. There is no in-game typed chat and one piece of equipment requires you to speak to the ghost; ask it questions like ""are you here"" or ""can you turn on the lights"" to help gather proof you need, or call its name to goad it to action.

One player has the option of remaining within the truck where they're safe and armed with tools to help the party; a video display to spot ghost orbs or watch the others' progress, a meter for how active the ghost is, the map of the building. Having the right gear to search effectively is going to be key, because you can leave a notebook for the ghost to write in anywhere, but it's not going to help you find it in the first place. A thermometer isn't necessary if the ghost lowers the temperature to freezing with its presence, you can see your breath, but it can help narrow down the search area.

Your primary objective is to identity the ghost but the real money is in the secondary ones: finding other occult objects like ouija boards or voodoo dolls, getting photos of the ghost, or having specific instrument recordings. Good photos are a money maker.

Of course the ghost is hostile. Knowing what you're up against can save your live; some fear the crucifix, others don't produce footsteps, one will actually keep the lights on because it draws power from the electrical grid. Identifying the ghost can be very difficult and there is a learning curve for the devices and what might be false readings, completely ineffective, or proper proof. But the sooner you do it, the safer you'll be for collecting secondaries.

And yeah, it's scary as hell for the thing to suddenly whisper in your ear. To hear it stomping down the hall in pursuit. To catch glimpses of it as you're snapping pictures and backpedaling. How about asking if it's nearby and just having an invisible voice reply ""YES""? Or finding that it locked the exit, trapping you with it?

It's in early access and I'm hoping they don't drop the ball and call development quits after a few weeks of popularity. There's a number of quality of life issues they can address and a lot they can expand upon with the premise; more ghosts, equipment, or maps. Horrible new death animations. Maybe even a mode where you play the suckers trying to get the yurei who ate the interns out of the abandoned high school.",1601612407,1601612684,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,261,15,1565,1565,718,1602035993,,

The glitches I've experienced are...

-Multiple times after finishing games the game would go to black forcing me to close the game and most of the time I wouldn't get the money or XP.
-Most of the time when you take a picture of the ghost it doesn't complete the objective.
-The voice commands work almost none of the time with a Ouija board.
-Occasionally the cameras flip back and forth over and over which can cause seizures.
-1/4 of the time if you join a game your microphone won't come through what so ever.

I'm a total chicken pansy when it comes to just about anything spooky and I generally avoid early access horror games like the plague, both for their inherent spook factor and their notorious track record of generally being quite ass.

With that being said, this game is fantastic. There's so much love and care put into this product to make it an overwhelmingly enjoyable and tense experience. From things like switching between local and global voice chat to communicate effectively (and your radio being cut off when the ghostie's comin' for ya) to the multitude of gadgets and gizmos that you use to track down all different manners of supernatural entities from your basic spirit or poltergeist to something as aggressive as an oni.

One of my favourite things about this game is how it manufactures and constitutes so many organic scary moments that you can share with your friends and endure together. Speaking of ""friends"", definitely find some people to play this with. (not just because it's really scary on your own, but it's just a blast with a full team)

Another thing I really like about this game is the inclusion of voice recognition. Even when you're not on either of the voice chat channels, the ghost can still hear you and will actually respond to things you say, like if you tell them to ""close a door"" they might actually close a door and send your heart into orbit.

I just highly recommend this title. It's a lot of fun, endlessly replayable, and dirt cheap.

Overall very scary and fun 

The game has a steep learning curve due to the lackluster tutorial, but the non-violent ghost will help you learn the capabilities of each item with effort. It has great replayability and I feel like there is something new to learn in every haunting. Using voice chat to talk to teammates will also be heard by the ghost, I found this to be an amazing concept. I am still spooked every time I am left alone or hear a.. *shudder* a grudge noise right behind me.
  My issue with the game is the amount of people who make public lobbies when it should be private because they are waiting for their friends, resulting in players getting kicked.

44,Phasmophobia,76885004,english,"For a short review the game is great for the price: especially considering this game was made by one man. 

The pros: 
This game, especially in the beginning, makes the player figure out a lot of things for themselves. Giving major satisfaction when the player figures out a new tool or way of communicating with the ghost. 
Another great aspect is the voice recognition! There is a whole list of phrases and words that the ghost can interact with you can look up the entire list but it’s better to figure them out for yourself! For example saying “I’m scared” actually triggers the ghost in game to do scary stuff. S P O O K Y
Another great thing this game provides is the major satisfaction of investigating correctly every single time we get the right ghost it gives you a sense of pride! Go on try it for yourself!
I also love the local and global voice chat that is offered. 
Now like I said all in all the game is great and there are way more good stuff I could go over but I have to be honest about the negative side of things as well

Cons
The game can get repetitive. Especially after completing a good amount of missions. By the time you are lvl 15-20 you are (in most games with a competent team) can get in and out before things get spooky. 
Another thing that is super frustrating and at times game breaking is an audio bug that seems to happen pretty regularly. I would say 30% of all games has a chance for either you or a teammate or in some cases multiple teammates to not be able to hear one another. It is super frustrating and makes the game unplayable for that round. Hopefully this is fixed soon. 
Another small thing is that some items are useless to non-VR players. For example you cannot light a candle unless you are in vr or unless you hold the candle and another desktop user lights it for you. As you will find out in the game VR players have a major advantage.
One major reason after about level 20 you start to feel the game getting repetitive is because the ghost is locked to a single room, yes they can hunt and kill you in another room but when they are not hunting they are pretty much stuck in that room which is why it makes it so easy to find that room get all the info and leave before the hunt can even begin. The game would feel much more immersive if clues were spread out throughout the entire house rather than just one room. 
Some objectives are unclearable, for instance if the ghost isn’t “confined in a bathroom” then there will never be a dirty sink to take a picture of so no bonus money. 
It does seem like there are more common ghost and so you see those ghost way more often while about half of the ghost are never seen. (This could just be my experience)
When you are dead you are only an observer if they could make it to where you could either A. Watch as the ghost hunts your teammates or B. Somehow communicate through the spirit box or a oiujia board to communicate with your teammates would add a level of immersion that would be amazing rather than just being an observer. 

With all this being said it is in early development, and hopefully the creator is willing to hire others to make this game become something truly amazing with updates! I would say at the state the game is still playable and super fun! Especially for only $15 dollars so give it a try!",1601594653,1601594653,TRUE,1,0,0.523809552,1,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,23,1,1438,1438,669,1601972340,,

Tons of walking around in the houses with a dimly lit flashlight while absolutely nothing is happening. When I finally did reach the ghost, I used the methods given to me in a tutorial and left the area. I got my ""victory"" and went on to the next one and to the next one... I was only wishing for this game to get better once the difficulty gets more challenging, but in 4 hours I was still stuck at amateur level even though I did most of the tasks perfectly. I refuse to believe that I am the only one that is not scared of completely normal empty houses. 

But I can recommend this game to people who think that slenderman and zombie movies are absolutely horrifying. This type of ""horror"" is just not doing anything for me. I gave this game too big of an opportunity

95,Phasmophobia,76620807,english,"This game is scary, not the jumpscares and loud noises so it spooks you kind of scary, but like the atmospheric, walking straight in the dark, feel like there is something constantly around you kind of scary.
You are not a fighter in this game, there is no way you can do to beat the ghost, you can slow them down, you can run, you can hide, or even escape, but there is no way you can say that you are absolutely safe once you step in the house. 

I have to say, though I don't play horror games a lot, I can really tell that this is once of the best co-op horror ever existed, from the game playstyle, to the audio, they all send chills down your spine. The ghost is in the house, you know it, but you have to walk in, cross your fingers you can walk out, alive, that is.

The game certainly has its flaw, it is early access after all. The game is pretty linear, I'll say, meaning you'll start to get used to it after a few matches. And because there isn't really like some very delicately designed ""spook-spot"", some people may not even find this game scary (though personally I have to ready an extra pair of pants playing each match).

Plays a bit like the ""Big Oil (day 2)"" Heist from Payday 2, except with the shooting replaced with the eeriness of a Slenderman-like ghost lurking around.

This game shines in pressure scenarios. During a Ghosts hunting period, a ""survive or die"" encounter in late game, the intensity builds up as the Ghost becomes more active. Your teammate calls out ""The lights are flashing upstairs"" or ""the motion sensors gone off"", and you desperately try into pre-empt the Hunt and evade death. 

So under pressure you quickly check to see if there are closets you can hide in, there's none, so since you know your ghost hunts isolated players you desperately attempt to group up with your teammates.

Had some issues with voice recognition at the time of this review which was a little frustrating but you can't expect fully polished game from an early access, I followed the developers pinned discussion board and it's now working at least when I press B to speak in game. Can't wait to see where they go with it, so many good things they could do. Glad it's got the recognition it deserves.

When failing to get a reaction from the spirit, me and my friend usually stand at the front door and call it's name over and over, and saying over voice 'Show yourself'. And then we act surprised when it comes to snap us in half. I usually end up getting locked out and him getting locked in, he screams like a little girl for a few seconds, I open the door, hes folded like a deck chair on the floor.

Either that or you must have friends who are willing to work around your lack of communication and can fill in the talking role, but definitely wouldn't recommend trying that with randoms.

While the game does a great job of staying scary and engaging even after you start understanding the mechanics I probably had more laughs out of it (while in multiplayer) instead as this game takes the ""best"" out of everyone.

I have never before experienced having a need to shout insults at the ghosts into the entrance of the house along with the gang just to run away crying as soon as the ghost appears. Or witnessing all those attempts at pulling out people out of the truck just for them to walk along the walls while staring at a floor only and too scared to look anywhere else. Or to see those brave souls scream and sob their way out of the building just few seconds after putting a brave face on.

If you can VR this 100% do it although some of my friends reported getting sick easily in it without fiddling around in the locomotion settings first. I encountered no problems.

Very sturdy for fresh Early Access release and devs seem to do a good job so far as well.

Come the fourth instruction, as I turned the corner to the living room, a big disheveled guy in dirty clothes and bared teeth and wielding axe was walking towards me. I screamed and then NOPE'd out of the tutorial before ghost can come any closer.

29,Phasmophobia,76861497,english,"I like the idea of the game and it looks fun, however, it is extremely difficult to actually play the game and it was very frustrating trying to figure out the basic functions of the game without having to look up tutorials for the tutorial. 

The tutorial is terrible and doesn't properly explain or show you how to play the game at all. It would be beneficial to have a set room with the ghost in it and maybe an outline of where to out the camera and book etc so the player can get a general idea of what they're supposed to do. It took me 20 minutes to figure out just how to put an item down without throwing it, and the tutorial controls mention nothing about what left mouse button is for despite it having many functions in the game, such as opening doors and interacting with placed items. 

The mechanics are clunky and don't seem to work well at all. Voice chat did not work at all for myself or some friends I was playing with and we could not hear our teammates. Its not well explained how to use the voice feature for the radio or anything, does the static mean something? Are those voices on the radio, the glitched VC or is it the ambient ghost? Who knows! I certainly don't! 

I also find it frustrating that you can't play the game with less than 4 people in a private lobby, which makes it difficult to play the game as well, since we spent so much time trying to find a lobby we could all be in. We couldn't start our own as people kept leaving instantly. I also noticed that the part where you add things to your inventory doesn't actually display how many of the items you have in the list, which was strange. 

I also think it would also be good if there was some icon/UI feature that displayed what you have in your inventory/how many things you have in your inventory so you know how much you can carry. The torch was also weird- it worked through 'T' without one in my inventory, but later 'T' stopped working until I had the item in my inventory. Not really sure what was going on there. 

The sound effects are very good and the spooky ambiance is very nice and the footsteps have made me jump a few times, but at the moment that's about the only good thing I can say for the game.

50,Phasmophobia,76859256,english,"In short, fun and surprisingly creepy/terrifying/unnerving. Already feels like a complete game even though it was just brought to early access not that long ago. The game does have a few crashing after completing a game and a voice bugs when sometimes joining rooms, but other then being annoying these bugs don't cause a loss of rewards or equipment.

A brief overview of a round's experience is below. Note: On difficulties above Amateur, you lose all equipment you brought with you on a mission if you get killed. This can be costly and requires numerous rounds to build up the cash to buy it all again, but isn't so bad that it would cause rage quitting. It just adds spice to the game.

Me and three of my friends, being the professionals that we are, decided to tackle a ghost at an Asylum. This not being our first rodeo, we came fully stocked with all the gear a ghost hunter could ever need, most of the equipment being purchased by me. We broke up as individuals to quickly locate the ghost and after a few minutes we determined that the haunting was originating from the kitchen.

We quickly converged on the location and setup all our instruments to determine what we were dealing with. I retreated to the safety of the truck to coordinate the investigation and give directions to a member of ours that was lost in the basement. After some quick research we knew what we were dealing with and everyone met back at the truck. At this point, we had burned through our sanity pills and everyone's sanity was dangerously low, except mine, since I'd been in the truck safe and sound. 

We had one mission left, get a picture of the ghost. We had every precaution in place and my sanity was the only one high enough to safely go back in. So I decided to go anger the ghost to show itself and snap a pic so we could get out of there. What's the worst that could happen...

I go into the kitchen, with my three companions, bravely hiding in the truck and watching me through multiple cameras. In the kitchen with my camera ready, I proceed to call out the ghosts name and insult it's entire family back several generations. After all, I'm safe, it won't hunt me, no danger here. Right as soon as a call it a b**** and demand it give me a photo op, my radio goes dead and my flashlight starts flickering, which means the ghost is on the hunt and is going after the only person in the asylum, me.

I do the manly thing and immediately panic, being in it's room, quite possibly the worst room to be in on the planet at the moment. I don't see the ghost, so I start running towards the dinning room, a few steps that way, I think, wait, what if it is coming from the dinning room. The kitchen is near the front door, I can just run that way and get out. I spin around and sprint across the kitchen to head out the other exit. It is at this point I remember that the front doors will have slammed shut and be locked while the ghost is hunting. It is also at this point that I hear loud footsteps behind me getting closer.

Running out into the hall I dive into the first room I see, which happens to be a small bathroom. I slam the door and proceed to huddle behind my new porcelain friend and praying the ghost doesn't find me. The footsteps continue to get louder until I hear them stop just outside the door I'm cowering behind. I then hear what sounds like claws running across the wood of the door very slowly. After about another 20 seconds of this, the hunt stops and I promptly flee from the building and dive into the truck.

We all decide as a group that we don't need the extra money for a picture of the ghost and leave. It was totally worth it.",1601556173,1601556173,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,712,66,1338,1338,1322,1601625505,,

Finally a horror game in this day and age that is good and a lot of fun.
It doesn't revolve around jumpscares or huge amounts of gore.
The specters are based on lore from real encounters from different cultures over time.
The equipment is what paranormal investigators really use when they ghost hunt.
Each experience is a new one and can have lots of laughs and lots of scares.

I only recommend a few things to spark this up to make this a Classic for times to come:
- Different deaths for players from the many specters. 
- The kills can be seen by other players.
- The ghosts can be seen through reflections, maybe have a randomly generated body/face each lobby, and can pop up outside in the van sometimes
- hallucinations from panic
- FRIENDLY SPIRITS (but very rare, and can do fun/funny stuff) 
- Actual dispersion of the specters (like exorcisms and cleansing)
- P O S E S S I O N and to be able to hunt down others.
- More missions than just getting objectives to make it more difficult
- Players can be a specter in a game mode
- Outside maps (woods, playgrounds, city streets)

I know it's a lot to ask for but this is just chock full of potential and it's already a blast.

1. The games controls in VR are bad and only set up for VR, not even my Steam Knuckles controllers!
2. Game wouldn't be to scary to me not in VR, but in VR it takes a lot of immersion away due to the controls and the animations lacking.

I seriously have no idea. The idea is simple. You and up to three of your friends (or random people via a matchmaking function) are paranormal investigators. You're at a location to discover what type of ghost is haunting the location. You use devices such as an EMF, a ghost writing book, temperature gauge, and so on to determine what type of ghost it is. You try to take pictures of it, and other things, to get money to buy new equipment.

Oh yeah, and you try not to die.

If the ghost gets angry enough, it'll try to murder you. It will also throw things around, leave behind fingerprints, turn off the lights, cut out your radio, and in general just mess with you. 

It's such a simple concept, but it works. It works well. There's some spoopiness in it, and some jump scares, but it's more atmospheric than jump-scarey. I've screamed like a little girl many times, even when I know the ghost is hunting me.

The game is 4 player coop, the object is to figure out what type of ghost is haunting the place. You buy equipment to help you narrow down the list of signs that ghost give off, like cold breath, finger prints, white noise chatter, and such.

There are lots of ghosts in the game like demons, wraiths, phantoms, jins, banshee, poltergeist and so forth. The places you go are chosen at start of mission, but the ghost is random every time and so is the room or location inside the place is haunted. Like you can play same map, but get a different ghost haunting in a different room. Because there is a wide variety of ghost and some ghost share similar signs, but every ghost has a particular thing they do.

The game uses your mic to talk to the spirit. The game knows a variety of phrases, like saying the ghost name, or a phrase ""hello"" ""who are you"" ""show your self"" ""say something"" just say what comes to mind as if you are talking to a spirit and want that spirit to interact with you.

Lots of replay value here. Great game to play with friends. I suggest mics in game. Make sure you know which key is push to talk. There are 2 push to talk keys. Once is proxy chat, and other is Walkie-Talkie global.

This game works with VR and NON-VR. Don't matter if VR or not, you can still play together.

As time dragged on higher and higher paranormal levels were being detected, My friend, inside the house, was speaking to the ghost as a level 10 spike occurred. I immediately called to him and told him to get out. He grabbed the camera and started running down the stairs as his light began to flicker. Then, the camera drops. I see something fall in front of it and block the cameras vision. I panicked at that point, but decided to head into the house to check on my friend.

10,Phasmophobia,76853520,english,"My review to this game: 

This game, developed by only two people, is a really really great VR Horror and Non VR Horror game. Of course, because it's ""only"" two developers at this game, this game feels on some parts unpolished. Like the animations are kinda weird or the Multiplayer models in Desktop Mode look kinda janky. But this will improve with time. 
This game got good attention from youtubers and I think it deserves it. 

This game feels crazy good in VR. Playing this in VR is way more scarier because of the graphics this game has and the sound design. With VR you dont have the janky animations and you feel like you are the youtubers you watch for Abandon Horror investigating or investigating houses because people told you that their house is haunted - And hell, it is. 
The voice detecting in this game is great. You have to talk to the ghost to make it aggressive or to get answeres on the Spirit Box. 
The buildings are interesting and with increasing level you get bigger places, I dare to walk into. 
And the best of all: You can play it in Co-Op and using the ingame voice function and the walkie Talkie it's just freaking amazing. 

Defintily a must have for VR users, and definitly a must have for people that are into this stuff. 

People who dislike such kind of stuff will not be pleased in this game. When you search something like an Outlast Horror Game or something with great story, this isnt your game, but maybe it will. 
They have a Discord and a Roadmap, and from what I see on their discord, the developer are quite talkative with the Community. hence I think this game will get a story at some point. 

Overall - Phasmophobia a game developed by just two people - feels like there is a small team behind it. Yes, animations are janky, yes the player models look kinda weird, but the gameplay, graphics and sound design feels so polished that this makes up for it.

44,Phasmophobia,76850365,english,"At first, I thought that this would be a game that either my friends and I wouldn't play more than once, or it would be a game we would be too scared to play but I was wrong. 

Positive:
The game has this good game play loop that feels rewarding once you actually complete the contract and guess the right ghost and keeps you interested the whole match with the ghosts AI kind of teasing you along and giving you clues. I also appreciate the scary level of the game because it doesn't have jump scares or really any cheap thrills it's more wanting you to fear the unknown because everything is unknown when you start the match, I mean the maps are the same but you never know what is going to be there each time and you never know what could be lurking around the corner or hunting you. I think if the game added jump scares and cheap thrills it would really ruin the gameplay because then you would be going into the maps just to have something spook you for 20 mins plus but for right now (I will update my review if it changes) the ghost will really mainly play with you until you piss it off and really make you fear it to the point when you see it there is a good chance you will freeze up out of just terror.

Negative: 
I honestly don’t have many issues with the AI but the difference between an amateur mission and a professional mission is a little staggering and what I mean by that is in professional if you are not in and out and a little lucky you will most likely lose at least two players, but granted my group and I could become better with more practice hopefully. This isn’t that big of grip yet but I do hope the add more medium to small sized maps semi quickly, I know it’s a small dev team but the large maps are a bit too much sometimes so my group and most Randoms agree the smaller maps are more fun. 

Community:
(I will update this category if my opinion changes) I am very pleased with the community so far I have not run into anyone that is overly critical and mean really about anything and in a game that can get fairly scary I think it is important. Multiple times I have been very scared and it’s was hard for me to want to get out of locker or something and every time I admitted that I needed someone to come and help me get out of the house they always say yes and come to help. Most higher-level players I have seen are helpful to newer players and make sure that they don’t get roasted by the ghost.

49,Phasmophobia,76849824,english,"Bruh, this game kinda spooky though.

For real this game is probably the only horror game that actually scares me even the slightest in recent memory. It has the fear of the unknown when you start playing, the perfect ambiance to set up some scary moments involving the ghosts, subtle build up with small things that get you afraid (ie. the spirit box, flashing lights, sounds, emf readings), all leading to the hunts which lets you, most likely, see the ghost your dealing with in its physical form for the first time. Its all so well blended that after buying this game about a week a go, I've been playing everyday with friends and haven't really gotten tired of it.

Oh yeah and its actually scary the more people you have, having someone monitoring the cameras while 3 of you are walking through the area to finally have someone notice something off is pretty spoopy if I do say so myself. Its one of the few horror games that does multiplayer right.

The bugs are pretty prevalent right now but the developer has been actively putting out updates to fix them are coming about every day or so, which is pretty amazing. The discord is very helpful in finding out problems and getting them to the developer. Most of the bugs that are fairly game breaking have gotten patched from what I've seen but there is still plenty since its in early access and actively being developed so expect somethings to get broken every once in a while.

The game is a bit jank with the DREADFULLY slow movement speed, and the non-vr being somewhat on the limited side in terms of positioning of cameras and such. Also I do recommend VR if you have it because well, it just makes the game creepier and more off putting (plus you can hold 4 items instead of 3 with the two hands you are blessed with).

All that said the game's really fun, has a great community from what I've seen, is even better with friends, and provides some good scares. Plus its cheap!

73,Phasmophobia,76848942,english,"NOT THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A PREMATURE REVIEW

This game can be super ambitious if the creators stick to it. 
Pro: Its scary as ever, the creaking floors, the atmosphere, the feeling that something is watching you. This what makes the game.

Con: Nothing major, personally its an easy fix. Me and my friends like to goof so making alot of things interactible would be funny for the soul. Then get insta-terrified when our guards are down.

Hope To See: 
100% GHOST SCARES (The book gives us a rough idea of what different ghost we deal with. Which is good, but I hope to see these ghost become so terrifying after the 1st scare players cant complete the level cause they dont want to go back.)

SANITY WATCH*a literal wrist watch* (So our sanity is important therefore we should have a watch to keep an eye out)

HEALTHBAR*can be in the watch too* (I think it'll be nice not to insta-die in most cases rather the ghost becomes violent and the house becomes a death trap like in movies. From locked doors which we need keys to escape or floating objects thrown at the player)

GHOST VARIETY (appearance is important so it's always nice to have ghost look scary as possible, granted the effects they do will do all the work.)

MORE LOCATION VARIETY (Most important by far, location location. House are fine but why limit it there. Motels, Forest, Mansion, Graveyard, Schools, Factories to which plays into the ghost's strength and weakness without having to grind to buy the tool that we might accidently lose)

DLCS NOVELTIES (Im pretty sure you have the tools down but that doesn't mean a person can buy a novelty proton pack from ghostbusters that just does 3 things at once rather than one tool at a time)

DLCS GHOST (This game can be a powerhouse for putting the most feared ghost and entities in it. Slenderman why not, The twins from the shining why not. Pennywise automatic horror why not. Obivious copyright reasons doesnt mean they cant make a renegade version with the same premise)

NOTE. It's tons more fun with a group of people. You almost need around 3 people to play. If you don't have friends, so far the community has been fantastic. Haven't encountered any toxic people.
Additional, a mic is required to play. Either to communicate with the team, or the ghost.

86,Phasmophobia,76847804,english,"Love love love this game! I end up having nightmares after every time I play but its so worth it. I'm awful with horror games but only way to really progress is to create more activity to anger the ghost by going room to room. So if you just sit in a corner (like I did), while everyone else is doing the work, you're not going to finish the mission as fast. Once I got over the creepiness and fear, the game is really fun. I love the subtle intensity. I love how theres voice interaction and that certain words on communications can trigger the ghost (don't say scared, run, hide, etc.). Not being able to run adds to the thrill as well. If you're marked and being hunted, calling for your teammates on the walkie talkie will not work so your best bet is to hide and turn off your lights. 

The game has a huge emphasis on teamwork and communication. So it is only really fun with the right people. Those who don't share info or say much can make the game boring. So push each other to talk more (chanting the ghosts name, talk to the spirit box, use the ouija board) and when you join a lobby make sure everyone there has a mic. 

My biggest issue though is how buggy (audio and game glitches) the game can be. Right away after loading into Asylum map, I could only hear 1 of the 3 other people. I could hear the click of the walkietalkie being used, I just couldn't hear what they were saying. I have also heard other people complain of this post lobby so its a global in game issue rather than map related. In the same game during the ""hunt"", I got stuck hiding in a room, and my game crashed. This then caused the entire game to bug out since the game didn't register me leaving, thus continuing the hunt. In hunt mode, the doors to the exit is locked. They tried throwing the crucifix at the ghost and tried standing in front of it to die so maybe the doors would unlock again, but instead the ghost would walk up harmlessly. So my game crashing prevented my team from completing the game (no reward collection) which we lost about an hour of time for. Still def fun tho! I wish exiting the game put us back into the lobby instead of exiting to the main title. I didn't get to add the randoms we found :(

Some things I wish they would add:
*More variety of voice lines: When asking whether the ghost is child or an adult to the voicebox, the voice is always a male. Having the voice match the answers (or gender) of the ghost would be nice, such as if the ghost says ""child"" it'd be cool to hear it in a child's voice rather than a grown man in his 30's. 

*Speed bar for running: The running right now is more of a fast walk than run. I like that I can't run since it adds to the thrill (plus if I'm slow, the ghost is usually slow as well), but I've heard others complain for a faster option to run. Having a speed bar and having to pay attention to how much stamina I have left would be interesting as well. 

*Match history: I wish I could review the stats of a mission. This would include people I've played with (I want to be able to add them in case I crash again), how fast the mission was completed, how many times we've each encountered the ghost, hotspots of our activity vs ghost activity, and what items were used.",1601532647,1601533347,TRUE,1,0,0.523809552,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,4,1,449,449,449,1601529319,,

Is it worth it?

the short answer: yes, probablyThe longer answer:
If you have VR it's especially worth it, it's really good quality and a rare thing to find a co-op game that's also scary, particularly good with friends.It's still got quite a lot of the early access jank and it's pretty buggy at times, and definitely could use some additional features to cut down on what I can already forsee turning into a repetitious experience once you ""figure out"" how it works. For now though, it's already pretty damn solid and even with minimal extra work by the developers it'll be a great game. Even if you don't have VR then it's still worth it, a lot of the atmosphere is taken away when you're not on a headset though

Too frequent crashes or disconnections completely ruin the game, as all your experience and money is lost. The 15 minutes you spent hunting clues and getting all the objectives is just lost.

Some ghost signs are completely inconsistent. I did 3 matches. 1 involved EMF5 & Ghost Writing, never saw Ghost Orbs, but that's what we missed. 2nd we got all 3 clues. 3rd match in School came down to EMF5 & Ghost Writing. So we needed to check for Ghost Orbs, Fingerprints, or the Spirit Box.

We had the room and I personally scoured the room and area for fingerprints with the blacklight, couldn't find anything. Even after the ghost haunted us, slammed the door, rang the phone, etc. Nothing on windows either. It even appeared, and chased us down the hallway (at lvl 10). Went back to the room, no fingerprints. We went to the truck, and 3 went back with the Spirit Box to check for that and get the last objective (spirit sticks). They were haunted thrice and chased down the hall. My game crashed of course. They returned to the truck and guessed Oni. Nope, Revenant, but we never found any fingerprints after it attacked us 4 times. So we got it wrong, but even then I got nothing due to the crash. After 3 matches I had only $75 bucks.

Audio mic frequently refuses to work for my friends, and has not worked for me at all, meaning I have to use Discord, which takes away a lot from the experience.

42,Phasmophobia,76414516,english,"I expected Phasmophobia to be an asset flip/gmod-horror-map-type deal. That's actually what I thought it was the first two days I played it.

Tonight I learned that's not even close.

Honestly, I really didn't enjoy myself at first. This game was hard to learn, and the tutorial confused me even more. I was thankful that I streamed my first time with this game because a friend and viewer who is familiar with it helped my team out with some basic mechanics. The community is really chill and the dev is active.

I enjoyed what I thought was a bunch of silly jumpscares and random events ... but then I learned there's an actual roaming ghost on the map that you have to track down. For whatever reason I didn't realize that at first, it dramatically changed the game for me. I sincerely thought it was just a ""haha, go in, walk around, spooky things happen, someone dies, you guess a ghost, and leave."" You're actually dealing with an AI! This game is quite intense (and insanely fun), and I can't wait to play it in VR someday.

It's hard to find a horror game that does atmosphere well nowadays. Phasmophobia nails it. Being hunted is pretty frightening, especially when you're crouched behind a table hoping those footsteps don't come closer to your hiding spot. Several times while on the way out of the location's front doors, the ghost has slammed and locked in one of my teammates' faces. I never relax until I cross that threshold. Even then, I'm still scared out of my mind because I know I'm going to have to go back in.

There's typical early access bugs (getting stuck in things, objects flying, etc) and the controls are a bit clunky, but what's here is VERY cool and shows a lot of promise. The concept works surprisingly well. It's worth keeping an eye on Phasmophobia if you're not yet convinced, but this is a generous price for a pretty thrilling experience with a high replay value!

I concur with what seems to be the consensus of a lot of reviews: Phasmophobia is even better when enjoyed with friends.

Finally, I highly recommend joining the discord. The dev is very active and focused on the game, and the community is quite friendly.",1600842098,1601528275,TRUE,1,0,0.523809552,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,139,15,3360,3360,2384,1602036209,,

90,Phasmophobia,76843769,english,"Truly the good kind of horror, no cheap jumpscares, no random loud noises or music to make you jump for no meaningful reason, this game manages to scare you through good atmosphere and sound design despite not having very good graphics or animations. The whole thing about solving the puzzles to discover what kind of entity haunts the place you are investigating, the feeling of never truly knowing what you are dealing with and what kind of danger you are in each game, makes this a game that not only manages to be really scary but also very fun at the same time.
Judging by how good the game already is despite how early in development it is only speaks good things about it's future, sure, right now the game might be buggy, kinda ugly, use some default animations, some stock sounds and text to speech voices for some stuff, which can be quite off putting when you are immersed in the atmosphere, but that's to be expected of a game so early in development, but when the developers finish polishing this rough diamond I can only expect it to be one of the best and most popular horror/puzzle co-op games out there.

What I would personally like to see later on is attention to detail such as more animations and effects, different models for different kinds of ghosts, age of ghosts(of course a child ghost and an old man ghost won't look the same), and genders of ghosts as right now all types of ghosts can have both male and female names, (without of course making them too unique so players can't just tell which kind of ghost it is whenever it makes a random apparition and just win from that.)
And maybe story clues behind each haunting for immersion such as: Finding a diary that might (or might not) have some crucial clues about who used to be it's owner, aka, the ghost, e.g. it's age, which was it's room or favorite room of the house, or if they had many frustrations so you can speculate if it is one of the angry or vengeful kind of ghosts. Or maybe when getting an answer from a spirit box, let's say, in the school map, judging if it's a child's or an adult's voice you can speculate if they were a student or a professor/staff, and then you can maybe ask with your own voice the right question, such as in which classroom they used learn/teach, you MIGHT just get the answer to which room they are haunting. Of course all this could be just generic clues and bits of information that can get randomly swapped, mixed, changed slightly at the start of each round or be completely absent from a game.
I am no game designer, I'm just saying what I think sounds cool, but I think making the whole detective work to find out about the ghost besides the hard proofs would be really fun in this game.",1601523972,1601523972,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,105,3,566,566,414,1601704103,,

No. Seriously.

Every time the people in our group make jokes at the expense of the ghost, it's flashlights flashing and yodels of terror as you find the nearest room with a door and huddle in a corner, praying the entity doesn't find you.

It doesn't have the best graphics in the world and it doesn't need to. Something about the eerie familiarity of each map is enough to make you uneasy as you traverse the darkness, searching for clues that you're not really sure you even want to find.

The rewarding feeling of getting to buy more items so that you have the idea that you might be better equipped this round leaves you sorely mistaken when the power goes out and you are stuck in the dark with a locked door and no means of escape.

100/10 I do recommend. 
This is recap of my terrifying encounter in this game.

My friend and I were playing this together exploring an asylum we didn't encounter anything at first. The place after a while started to seem like it went on forever dead ends, long dark hallways, terrifying. So after a while the map started making me feel very uncomfortable and uneasy, I wanted to get back to the van. We started trying to find the exit after being in there for at least 20 mins with no activity finally we get back to the lobby area and see the exit my friend leading ahead about five feet reaches the door first and as soon as he gets out the doors shut and my light starts to flicker. My biggest fear in this game is the door shutting as I'm walking towards it... So I just start loosing it I'm freaking out hyperventilating, shaking, I curl up in a ball by the door as my friend is trying to help all he could do was throw a crucifix through the door past me blocking the hall. After what seemed like forever it stopped I got out of there as fast as possible, and I grabbed a candle before we left and I thew it in the doorway and insulted the ghost. I then decided to go grab it which I ultimately regretted... The I turned around to walk out and the doors slammed shut I broke down worse then before my friend threw the crucifix back though the door and saved my life. Finally after the second encounter we left. I need to breathe after that... I don't know if I'll ever play that map again.

This game is terrifying at times and very thrilling, no game has ever scared me as bad as this game.

Second time around, we were all able to enter the house, but all our equipment seemed pretty useless. The radio for example didn't seem to do anything. We said the ghost's name many times and it didn't necessarily seem to do much. The same death animation happened for everyone, not really particularly scary. 

I will say that it's a creative idea to have your teammates drop out, but I wish that they could do more once they're dead.

This game is gonna take off.

The gameplay loop and mechanics are best described like this:

The fear in this game is set by atmosphere and tension, not jump scare tactics. And the reaction my body gives is abrupt and genuine. Fear. I should not be here. I am not welcome. *cold shivers and goosebumps*

If you are paranormal enthusiast and have been looking for or waiting for an Investigation Sim type game with some creative artistic liberties taken over realities for the sake of gameplay xD this is it.

Even professional mode gets boring eventually once you figure out how to go in, and know what to look for. It's definitely the best horror game out on the market by far. I don't have VR so I can't say from that perspective. Every game is gonna be different which is great! Some will be quick while others will be long due to you being scared to complete the hunt, or bugs in the game preventing you from finishing every objective. It has its bugs yes, but nothing game breaking. Overall the game has so much replayability that I will definitely give it a 10/10 for just being early access. The inventory you have is great, but some items are limited like you can only bring in 2 glow sticks. Helps you see your path once you lay them down to not get lost in bigger maps, but just hide in closets or corners and you are fine 95% of the time for sure during hunts. Amazing game to stream as well for all of you streamers, but I highly recommend playing with friends for more fun and scares! Best way to earn money is the harder modes, completing objectives, and taking photos of bones, writing in books, fingerprints, dirty water, and the ghost. If you want a harder challenge like we are doing, then go on into professional with nothing but the base equipment. Really adds to the horror as you are short on supplies, and really pushes you to be at your best. The bigger maps take longer for sure due to limited equipment.

2. maybe add some classic jump scares. Like a face popping up on the screen, and screaming at you (also, just more sounds from the ghost in general would be good).
3. faster movements, for the player and the ghost. this will create much faster gameplay, as a ghost begins to chase you throughout the halls of a school, or an insane asylum, and you're too afraid too look back in fear of it catching you, as your ears begin to bleed from the ear defining screeches of the wrath.

For what little Ive played of the game on the desktop, the game ran smooth and was creepy, however, it stopped being fun when I cant even get the objects in the game to be placed as intended... every time I put down the camera to point at a certain area of  a room, the camera would be placed lens down. Kind of hard to spot a ghost if your only picking up the carpet and radiator. 

What can I say about the in game option? No, not plural as there is only one....audio. Sure you can adjust these in the main menu, but dont we all expect at least some degree of control (or the ability to read the key mapping at the very least) while in game...I know I sure do.

I was like whatever, what can possibly go wrong.
I asked ""how old are you?"", after repeating this question  couple of times, lights went out and suddenly I heard my buddy start screaming ""she is coming"" and I saw a creepy lady covered in blood chasing my friend with a sickle and when he was about to get out from the house he started shouting and screaming like a mad man ""THE DOOR IS FU**** LOCKED"" and then I saw her killing him right near the exit.

18,Phasmophobia,76833191,english,"One of the most terrifying games I have ever played. The horror is perfect. It's all about atmosphere instead of constant loud noises and jumpscares. The atmosphere is sooo silent that you can hear the really quiet noises from the other side of the house, alerting you to the ghosts location. The variety of equipment and ghosts is also pretty good for a early access game. There is enough ghosts to make it an actual challenge in identifying the ghosts. The maps are all completely different and extremely eerie, especially the farmhouse, (that place is nightmare fuel). The whole gameplay is perfect, having the hunt phase identified by the flashlights, the emf reader in the truck spiking at 10, these moments are terrifying when they happen as you know somethings about to go down. One of my favourite parts of the game is how you communicate to your teammates. You have local talk that's for teammates in close proximity and a radio for teammates at a distance. This is by far one of the coolest systems as it makes the game much more scary as you can't hear you teammates sometimes and you need to use the radio to communicate with them. This game also listens to your microphone to mess around with you more. There are over 150+ Phrases that once said will cause the ghost to react in a certain way. For example, using the ghosts name will cause it to get really annoyed and it might start being aggressive.

Only complaint I have is just with the slight lack of polish with interaction and movement. For example in the hub you can only pick-up 2 objects in the entire room which just seems odd, and within the actual game you can only pick-up equipment and you can't really interact with much else. This isn't a big deal as you have no reason to look around but it just would be nice. Also, there is some bugginess with the movement. There as times when I am trying to hid in a locker and my character keeps jolting around the locker and constantly blacking out my display and turning it back on. This is sometimes really annoying as I don't feel hidden and one of my teammates died when hiding in a locker which I thought couldn't happen. Another slight nitpick is the death animations aren't really scary after you have seen them for the 6th time and just become more frustrating.

But apart from those two little nitpicks, it is definitely the best VR Horror Game currently out now. I highly recommend and the price is completely worth it!

- I went up to the Log Cabin while my three other friends messed around in the van.
As I walked up I started saying ""Weeee Woooo, Weeee Woooo"" slowly over the walkie talkie. 
I stood in the doorway for a while and then finally stepped in.
The second I stepped in, the door slammed and locked behind me as my light started to flicker.
I immediately started shouting over the walkie talkie ""WEE WOO!! WEE WOO!! WEE WOO!!"" ""HEEELLP!!!"".
A shadow showed up on the left of me as something started whispering in my ear.
Then something else appeared at the other end of the room
It suddenly started sprinting towards me with loud thuds (sounding exactly like the IT 2 grandma scene)
As hands came over my screen I screamed my last ""WEE WOO!!"" as I died. 
They then found my body and left the mission right away.

Playing with friends is both hilariously fun and (obviously) a bit of a safety blanket on your fears. Have already spent many hours playing long sessions, only stopping because... it was close to bed time, haha.

Step 1: Use your equipment to locate the ghost
Step 2: Use your equipment to find out what kind of ghost you're dealing with
Step 3: Get out (hopefully alive)

The game does a great job with making you feel on edge.
You rarely die and there are barely any jumpscares, but the atmosphere really puts you on edge.
The ghosts usually only make their presence known with subtle details, so when they start becoming more active, you get caught off guard and they scare the hell out of you.

I do wish there was a step between 2 and 3. figuring out the ghost type is usually the last thing you do before you escape, so the knowledge of the ghost type rarely gets used, which is a shame because each ghost tends to act in a different way and it'd be cool if that played more of a role.

6,Phasmophobia,76829653,english,"I definitely recommend this game! It's incredibly atmospheric and is guaranteed to scare! There are a few issues here and there, but I can tell the dev, Dknighter, is quick about getting to them. Thank you! 

Growing up and watching ghost hunting shows, I've always wanted to take a stab at it myself, and this game lets you do just that. Right now, you have many of the tools ghost hunters would use in their line of work, and I'm positive that more will be added in.

The only two things I have to look at as a minus is that:
 
1. When a player dies, [spoiler] They become a ghost, or are in the spirit plane [/spoiler] there's not much to do except for waiting around, watching your teammates. If there was a teammate specific [spoiler] spirit box [/spoiler] that would allow one-word communication from the teammates, that might actually help things. Of course, people could troll, but it would give the players something to do.

2. There is only a small sense of fulfillment for me in [spoiler] discovering what ghost is haunting the area [/spoiler] I'm sure there are probably more things in the works, but I would love for there to be maybe a 3 part sort of thing, which would be:
-Discovery of ghost
-Investigation as to why they're there or what happened to them
-Possible Exorcising of the ghost and removal from the place of residence

I think that there should be more of a challenge like that and that [spoiler] not all the ghosts should be violent. It's a bit ridiculous to me that everyone's pissed off when they die lol I would think that maybe some peoples' death was an accident and they just wanted to stick around to see what was going on in peoples' lives. [/spoiler] 

I think these changes would add more flavour to the game and make it keep my attention for a long time to come. 

But to conclude, Phasmophobia is a brilliant game and I highly recommend it to everyone who loves to be spooked <3 Thank you for your hard work Dknighter!",1601497650,1601497650,TRUE,1,0,0.523809552,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,152,2,2047,2047,622,1601969497,,

15,Phasmophobia,76829339,english,"Sharing a haunting with others can be a uniquely frightening experience. Even if Phasmophobia isn't the sharpest ghost in the shed, basing it around drawing out the danger instead of simply running/hiding from it evokes a new type of dread. It's not unlike the thrill of daring a friend to poke a large snake with a short stick.

Gimmicks such as speech recognition are exciting, but its integration seems very shallow and it's difficult to gauge its accuracy. Still, speaking to the spirit and getting any sort of response is an event that gets the whole crew shaking. People often take this element quite seriously which only adds to the immersion.

The overall polish that's on display often takes away from the atmosphere. The way characters stiffly look around and slowly reverse-moonwalk is hysterical. On the rare occurrence where apparitions do show themself, their appearance is often static, janky, and underwhelming. Giving additional attention to the ghosts’ visuals could go a long way. Dynamic, intelligent movement with dramatic particles could be a start. It'd be a shame to leave early access as without overcoming the Unity creepypasta game taint.

Keeping up ambiguity and maintaining space for discovery is essential for a sense of mystery, but confusion over basic applications has made introductions to the game very rough. A tutorial that makes sure to demonstrate positive readings would be appreciated. Subtle contextual button prompts would assist with the odd control scheme. As for mechanical transparency: defining the 'freezing' threshold, giving notes on the implications of lights/flashlights being on/off, and what phrases ghosts respond to are basic examples of missing feedback.

Launching with VR compatibility is a smart move. That said, the terror of any horror experience is wildly amplified by 3D and 6DoF, so Phasmophobia isn't responsible for the impact that’s inherent to the added immersion. Being in a dark room with the promise of a cube that will suddenly and unexpectedly violate your personal space would be distressing. It’s still a pants-filling way to play and worth trying [i]after[/i] familiarizing yourself with the gameplay.

In its current state, I'm not sure the game lives up to its steam rating, but its shared-scare premise has clearly been effective. Once again, friends tend to improve games and Phasmophobia doesn’t require much commitment which makes it great for randomly bringing others on board. It’s not a bad investment if you have two or more buds at the ready, especially if some of them aren’t used to horror games.",1601497156,1601497156,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,609,419,454,454,306,1601863156,,

Another way to improve it would be to go a similar route to Alyx or Boneworks and not allow players hands to clip through the walls, adding a feeling of solidness to the world.

78,Phasmophobia,76823943,english,"I have owned this game for 2 days, and have already pumped in just over 9 hours, as well as had nightmares for 2 days straight. I intend to pump many, many more hours into it. This is one of the best games I've ever played, and it's only in alpha. I can not wait to see how much further this game can go, especially since it was only released a little over 1 week ago. I am especially amazed at how fast it topped the charts for Top Seller, and it should be true foreshadowing for what this game will become. 

Of course, only being in Alpha, it does need a little polishing, and as such, I have some suggestions for the developer that may want to take into mind. I feel that the following suggestions may make the game feel a little more lively, ironic considering the games premise. The suggestions may already be obvious, or even planned for a future update, but I hope the developer takes them into consideration.

- [spoiler] [b] more death animations: [/b]. This would be good to deviate from the basic ""hands grasping player"" animation. [/spoiler]

- [b] more entity variety: [/b]. This does not mean to add more entities, but rather make them more distinguished. I truly understand the concept of the game IS to find out what entity the players are dealing with, however, the have been quite a few games where we have found all three pieces of definitive evidence, I.E pointing to a [spoiler] poltergeist [/spoiler] but it ends up being a [spoiler] demon [/spoiler] or a [spoiler] yurei [/spoiler]. Of course, this may be a bug, after all, it is still in alpha, but I hope this is more fleshed out as time goes on. 

- [b] PVP mode: [/b]. This would be an absolutely huge win in my book and would skyrocket the game more than it already has been. A PVP mode would be true insanity. Maybe of course have a minor nerf to the player who controls the entity as it may be way too strong for an actual human to control, rather than an AI. Of course, as the case with the AI, limit the player to [spoiler] certain rooms or portions of the map [/spoiler] or allow them to [spoiler] roam the entire map in larger maps such as asylum [/spoiler]. 

- [b] have entities truer to their descriptions: [/b] this also correlates to the second point in the list. I feel as if many of the entities we have encountered have been very cut and dry, and not as true to their descriptions as they can be. I've had [spoiler] poltergeists [/spoiler] behave like [spoiler] revenants [/spoiler] and i've had [spoiler] wraiths [/spoiler] behave like [spoiler] shades [/spoiler]. For example, I've had [spoiler] Jinn be extremely slow and stalkerlike toward the player, [/spoiler], which doesn't correlate with their descriptions. Of course, this may be a result of the evidence bug. 

- [b] Faster movement speed: [/b] This is fine for the smaller maps, but for maps like [spoiler] Asylum [/spoiler] and [spoiler] Middle School [/spoiler] this can be a real thorn in terms of game pace. I understand the developer does not want to make it easy on the player by any means, but I feel that for the bigger maps, a higher movement speed is in order to make the game more atmospheric, especially if you were running from an entity. You can even balance this by making the entities move faster.

- [spoiler][b] Have the dead players interact with the remaining group: [/b] This would make the game especially interesting and it could always be a help or hinder situation. Allow the dead players to convey messages through the ouija board or ghost radio. This would add a better sense of teamwork within the game. [/spoiler]

- [b] Higher player count: [/b] Although with most games having 4 players as the sweet spot, I feel like 6 players within this game would do it more justice. I have a bunch of friends that love this game and others that haven't bought it yet due to the fact that 9 times out of 10 so far, we have a full group. It would give a greater emphasis on teamwork, especially for the larger maps. This would entice more players and larger social circles to buy and enjoy the game.

All in all, this is an absolutely amazing game, and has fully convinced me to buy a VR headset for my rig in order to truly experience the game. I look forward to the many updates in Phasmophobia's future, and I can not wait to see how far the developer can take it. This truly is an atmospheric horror masterpiece that myself, and i'm sure, many others, have been waiting for. It is a breath of fresh air from the typical, mainstream jumpscare games and this will go down as iconic.

Things to work on: 
Not sure if its just me, but sometimes there will only be  1 or 2 ghost signs and I will need to guess the ghost based on other things experienced. 
More kill animations and jump scares, the game is spooky as is but more things to scare the player would make it far better. 
More ghost evidence, often my group only needs to make 2 trips to the ghost area to figure out which ghost it is. With more evidence or evidence that only shows up later it will extend the game and cause more ghost interactions.

Once you get into the habit of hunting ghosts, all your friends having roles (cameraman, main ghost hunter, van guy) it is actually great. The spooks i have gotten from this game are in-measurable. 

THERE ARE NO CHEAP JUMPSCARES!!!!!!!!! 

A few wee criticisms tho;

Ambient Sounds in the houses need to go. They are often jarring and take away from realism.

Different voices for the Ghost box and different ghost models - As I have hunted a women's name (Elizabeth Anderson or something) then spoke to 'her' on a ghost box. Her telling me that she is a child...THEN A BIG FUCKING MAN COMES OUT. Continuity would be cool

More ways to discover what ghost you're dealing with as alot of the time you get no EMF readings/ghostbox/them reading/orbs for a while and often get attacked before hand. Yet having a ghost play with a Ouija board or flicking the lights on and off for half an hour. Giving us no relevent information

I've only been brave enough to play with 3 friends and we've had a blast every single time we played. This game doesn't need cheap jump scares to get you but instead uses atmosphere and tension to get you.

Some cons that I noticed tho:
The ghost names were all pretty similar when we played. A few time the ghosts had the same first name or last name as the one we were hunting before that but this might just be coincidence.
Furthermore in VR me and my friends sometimes had trouble loading in if we were in VR.
Overall I'm gonna throw those cons on the fact that this game is early access and also say that it did not take away from the experience as a whole.

My actual experience of the game can be summarized by the following brief tale:
A friend and I were playing, we'd ticked off 2/3 evidence for what ghost it was and went back to the truck to get more things to test for the final piece.
Upon re-entering the house, we heard the ghost lady singing away merrily in a bedroom. After a brief discussion, my friend decided to shout ""hey you ghost b**** keep on singing you b****""
At which point the lights flickered like mad, the front door slammed shut and locked behind us and the ghost lady, quite offended at being called a b****, came charging out of the room and promptly murdered my friend in front of me.
My friend told me he was a ghost now and could help me scout out the rest of the house so we could complete the mission. To which I responded by crouching facing a wall away from the ghost saying I can't do this alone.
He told me to stop being a b**** to which I said I can't do this and quit the game.

I never expected to be so terrified in a horror game where I realized I was too weak to keep going.

I could make a giant list of all the things that are amazing about this game. But when a horror game succeeds with its atmosphere and oppression so damn well that I end up quitting (and I used to regard myself as something of a horror game veteran, but this game has made me realized I'm just a singing lady's b****), I have to take my hat off to it.

Com amigos é um excelente jogo, tem bugs, tem seus problemas, movimentação super simples, mas jogando com os amigos simplesmente vai perder o sono pela tensão e a hora vai voar!

Um excelente jogo de suspense! Não é um jogo onde se espera levar jumpscare e sair gritando igual louco… bom talvez no início seja tudo amedrontante, mas após umas partidas [COM AMIGOS] e começar a entender a mecânica do game deixa de ser o ""terror"" que talvez muitos classificam. 

É um jogo onde é criada uma preparação para descobrir qual tipo de fantasma você deve reportar, ou seja, você não vai para a caçada e sim para investigação, e quando as coisas apertam quem faz a caça é a entidade. 

O jogo está bem cruzinho por enquanto, bastante bugs e afins, mas para uma versão 0.1 está muito bem trabalhado em cima, claro, tem muito para se alterar, movimentação, padrões das entidades etc, mas com um bom toque dos devs creio que vão conseguir alimentar muito bem o game, por experiencia, recomendo jogar nos servidores [US] para evitar desconexões e frustrações.

Portanto, se você tem amigos que queiram jogar e se divertir com momentos de tensão, compre e vá fundo! USE O VOIP DO JOGO EVITE DISCORD principalmente pela mecânica de chamar entidade e afins.

Things I'd like to see added:

-Gamma slider in options

-Thermal Cam
-Laser Grid
-EVP recorder & playback
-Ability to erase / recharge the cameras still-pictures

||More supernatural beings: 
-Werewolves 
-Vampires
-Aliens (and more non-spiritual beings, bigfoot, hex in/around the house, etc)
-Fake-calls (catching homeowners/building-owners trying to fake a haunting - possibly via thermal reader/cam to catch heat prints)
-Non Ghosts: Solving the case by detecting just natural home happenings (lose pipes, old wood, or lose animals in the house at night)

Ghosts to sometimes whisper on the phone if they call

Allow dead players to keep playing by allowing:
Them to help by writing messages on mirrors/glass/windows
Allow them to investigate after death
Answer messages via spirit box by word multiple choice (to help accuracy & prevent trolling with free voice)

Example:
Teammate 1 says with spirit box active: ""Does the entity have -insert term- on their -insert body area- (for example: ""on their back"")
Dead Teammate 2s screen shows multiple answers on screen to select  (""Yes"", ""No"", ""Checking Now"".
The idea behind this, would be to have a few different entities share the same detail so that way the dead teammate can help, but not instantly-solve the what the entity is.

I've been playing with a friend of mine, and we've both had scares with this game. One of the last rounds we did, I was in the house, he was in the trailer, and while I'm investigating, I start hearing things behind me, so I turn around and this shadow figure appears from around the corner and starts chasing me. I FREAKED! I nearly took my headset off (I was playing in VR) and threw it to the side.

Basically, if you're looking for a scare, or just for something to play on Halloween, I would highly recommend this game.

EDIT: Played another couple rounds. After a couple mentions from the people I was playing with (along with a couple unnecessary comments about my use of it, even though they occasionally had the same issue), there's seems to be a need to keep transmitting with the radio for a brief moment after you've finished your message.

98,Phasmophobia,76787540,english,"If possible I'd like to see the devs add in some more objectives such as figuring out the cause of the haunting, and if it's more or less malicious in nature, make the ghosts feel just a hair bit more unique when you come across them, because at one point we had all the evidence point towards a poltergeist and it was just CONSTANTLY throwing things around in a kitchen, and it turned out to be something else instead i forget what exactly it was, but we were confused because i think we needed it to write or to having freezing temperatures and we NEVER got either of those...which made absolutely no sense to us. And to add in some more things with the spirit box i LOVE the spirit box so much but i wish there was a wider array of things the ghosts would respond to, like it would be cool if you could walk in to the room sit down and immediately choose a passive route or an aggressive route the aggressive route being ""Show me your presence"" and the passive route being ""We just want to talk"" those lines of questions would be awesome and more ghosts of course, another neat idea would be a mimic ghost, my idea for this would be a super aggressive but lone hunter ghost, so you stay together to be more safe, but if you're alone it will target the activity around the person who is alone, thus confusing the hunters as to where it actually is and adding in the suspense of being alone in a house that much more because you KNOW if it's a mimic or another ghost that wants to be alone, it'll definitely be more comfortable attacking you while separated, of course keeping the namesake of the mimic by allowing it to give any piece of evidence however the evidence that it does give this way is very rare, as an example let it interact with the spirit box, to say one or two things, but after that have it cut all response to the spirit box for a time this will force the player to stay ALONE in a dark room with a highly aggressive ghost, another cool thing to experiment with is the ghosts turning things in your hands off and upping the frequency of this if it's a poltergeist as they manipulate objects a LOT, and being able to leave fingerprints ON equipment as well, so if you interact with the spirit box and it gets shut off on you, you can scan it with a UV and see if there's a finger print on it, same with a flashlight, if possible have the ghosts slam the ghost writing journal in your hands. I absolutely love this game and if the devs would let me i would LOVE to be someone you can bounce idea's back and forth off of, not only for different kinds of ghosts but different actions the ghosts can take that would really frighten or unsettle players. Imagine if you will someone flashlight being turned off three times in the span of a minute or two how creepy that would be, especially with the flickering lights mechanic as well. As for my actual review of the game it's absolutely wonderful and i love it to death, it's SO MUCH FUN with friends, however for the people who can't get friends to play maybe consider adding in smaller houses with more places to hide in? Like an apartment complex has a haunted room maybe and you have two ""rooms"" to investigate that are open to you that each have 3 small rooms inside and a bathroom?

A surprisingly well-made ghost hunting game, with some impressive lighting, models, and graphics for a game using the Unity engine!
This game easily captures the true fear of real ghost hunts, and gives the player a new horror experience every time with different types of spirits and ghosts to hunt, as well as different places around the country to hunt such spirits.

Once the developers add more things to this game, I wouldn't be surprised to see this game blow up!  The game will absolutely thrive if the developers add more maps around the world, new ways to complete contracts, new game modes, unlockable cosmetics for completing contracts or achievements, new items to search for ghosts, or maybe ways to DEFEAT ghosts?...  Added with a fresh polish update to the quality of life, the list just keeps goin!

The cherry on top of this sweet game is the VR support!  A heart attack waiting to happen, but great feature to have!

A good pickup for the 2020 Halloween stay-in season!

0,Phasmophobia,76782799,english,"Pretty good game that I eagerly await more content for from the developer.

Atmosphere is great, doesn't rely on cheap jumpscares for the most part outside of having a ghost suddenly growl in your in one of your ears while giving you a back massage while you attempt to hide yourself in the bathroom from them.

Ghost designs are pretty good but them holding their weapons are a little bit goofy after you've grown used to them from extended play.

Gameplay is solid, you get what you pay for. A game about hunting ghosts using ghost hunting equipment with some other ghost hunters, though the animations could use a bit of work because looking straight up makes your character basically snap his/her spine while they turn into a walking L shape.

Equipment is varied with more to hopefully be added soon though some of the equipment can seem relatively useless like the parabolic sound sensors and wall mounted objects.

Ghosts come in various types with varied appearances with more to also be added soon hopefully.

----------

As for improvements I would like to see:

1) More emphasis on underused equipment like the wall mounted objects and parabolic sound sensor. Because currently the thermometer is basically the be all end all of finding what room the ghost is in.

2) The ability for the ghost to move from room to room to keep the hunters guessing. As the hunt basically consists of ""I have found the room the ghost is in"" to which everyone dogpiles into one room for the rest of the match sprinkling salt and 2 crucifixes onto the floor to lock the ghost down while everyone proceeds to antagonize it until it hunts to which everyone runs for the hills out of the room because there's a high chance the ghost will begin the hunt from where you find it.

3) More emphasis on the ghost's strenghts and weaknesses. As the ghosts are supposed to have strengths and weaknesses that you play around, but they don't feel different from eachother at all. Any ghost i've caught feels the exact same as the last ghost outside of how frequently they attack between more passive ghosts and more aggressive ghosts

4) Maybe an extra inventory slot for non VR players? Vr players are able to carry 4 objects since they can use seperate hands while us normal plebs are restricted to 3 items because we can't use our hands seperately.

5) More variety from the scares. As the game is scary don't get me wrong. But after i've played for 8 hours straight, having the same ghost spawn in with the same Death rattle sound effect standing their harmlessly in the corner of the room just kinda leads to me running face first into the ghost to mock it before it despawns because i've grown to expect it when i'm sitting in the corner of a room alone antagonizing the ghost with a ouija board and spirit box. 

The moments where the game truely makes the hairs on my neck stand up are when the game throws something at me i'm not ready for, but these are completely coincidental. Such as me walking into a room in my last game and getting an absolute faceful of a ghost that decided to spawn in my face in the door way without a sound as me and another hunter walk into the room which caused both of use to shit our pants for a moment.

------

As the game is currently though I rate it at a 8/10 for an early access co-op ghost hunting simulator.

I'll bump it to a 10/10 and write more details on my review once I see more content added to the game hopefully. The developer seems to be keeping up with patching the game currently as he made smudge sticks less oppressive against the ghost attacking and has already fixed a few obnoxious bugs such as the ""Zombie"" bug.

But I've gotta see that the dev is going to add more content such as maps, equipment and ghost types and isn't gonna turn around and dump the game before I turely bump the game up to a 10/10

WTF GUYS!

(Halloween update please add ghost sex, where a mechanic will be implemented to spirit boxes and Luigi boards so that you may ask the ghost to perform intercourse with you. I believe that this would provide a great increase in players and would definitely bump this to my favorite virtual reality game. The sex mechanic could help the team figure out if the ghost is friendly or not, also a romance meter could be added, sort of like the EMF reader but instead it detects the wielders relationship with the ghost. the sex acts aren't important as long as its implemented. If the player is able to reach max affinity with the ghost you should be able to take it home with you and you can have a ghost collection in your base (it will be behind the door in the base) this adds a fun collection mechanic to the game, all and all i just believe a sex update would be for the greater benefit of this game. thank you for taking the time to read my review.)",1601254812,1601408105,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,155,20,762,762,503,1601688613,,

EDIT:

So I have now played enough hours to check out its pros and cons. It has a good potential and has a lot of areas that can be improved.

Pros:
-Realistic atmosphere
-""Equipment"" based on real life investigations
-Ghosts look terrifying
-Ghosts sound terrifying
-no cheap jumpscares
-There is build up
-Each ghost type is unique
-Voice activated ghost response is genius
-Fun with friends and even strangers
-In-game voice chat is superb and adapts to environment. (it will echo in wide spaces indoors)
-spoopy maps

Cons:
-Ghost has no movement animation
-Ghost vocabulary in spirit box is very limited like under 5 words or so
-YOU LITERALLY CANT ""RUN"". YOU WALK LIKE A BABY AND THE SHIFT GIVES LIKE +1 SPEED UP.
-Some maps are too large to check each room, no hints where ghost room might be. (Asylum, school).
-This kid ghost said she's an adult and appeared as a child (yikes).",1601088052,1601401686,TRUE,1,0,0.523809552,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,49,5,941,941,582,1602003777,,

The mounting dread is killer in these otherwise normal houses as you attempt to uncover just what sort of spirit is haunting your location. A very fun game to play with friends; a very terrifying game to play alone. 

With two quick patches already, this early access horror title is very promising in my opinion. The random ghost type each time certainly allows for replayability, and the handful of locations already in add to the variety. I am optimistic about future updates; I would certainly like to see more ghost types and activity, and definitely more locations. The items could be tweaked more, and perhaps more could be included, but for now they do the job well.

My personal opinion?  The game right now is easily a 4/5. I give it a 4 because there are bound to be more bugs yet to be squashed, and there certainly is more content on the horizon to anticipate.

The environmental sounds help create a sense of dread as you explore and send tingles up your spine. This really works well in tandem with the assets and layout of the areas you explore.

This game has it all. Spooky atmosphere, various ghosts, and typical freaky locations you'd never want to be caught stuck with a murderous ghost in (plus some ones close to home).

The potential for memes is there, with voiceless gremlins locking your team in instead of the ghost, or the guy on VR who's played this game for hundreds of hours already, screaming at you about NOT hiding in the corner when shit hits the fan. 

It's already made a great impact with me in terms of enjoyment, so I think it's worth the price tag. The fact that the game keeps getting updates is also a good sign of its potential future development. For an early access game, it feels pretty polished. Will you put down the game for stretches of time? Sure. Is it worth the money that it's currently listed at? If you got a microphone and a headset, 100% yes. (If not, microphone elitists will kick you out of their games -- you have been warned :c )

Additional notes: This game is absolutely amazing! It's a game that tackles horror the right way, horror is not just cheap jump scares and loud noises.

I really admire how this game captures atmosphere comparable to real life, Asking ""can you turn off the light"" or ""move something"" and getting a response right before you is really unsettling and shows whatever you say you are being heard.

I HIGHLY recommend playing this game with friends. It takes coordination and planning to investigate, but if you go in guns blazing and cameras flashing, you WILL get your cheeks clapped by a ghost/demon/entity/etc.  One of the best games I've played and it deserves a lot more attention than it gets, especially because it has so few developers and they release patches all the time and updates.  Y'all really deserve a round of applause for this one boys.  Definitely worth the money (honestly, in my opinion, its at least a $20-$25 game).",1601373817,1601373817,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,249,2,2698,2698,609,1601700108,,
37,Phasmophobia,76754665,english,"Prefacing this by saying I do not play with VR.

Everything runs incredibly smooth, but character models look just absolutely awful (presumably because they're preexisting assets). The way other players' bodies move is just so unnatural it's funny; rather than turning their heads up if they look up, their ENTIRE back arches backwards while they somehow maintain balance and it's just incredible. You can see your teammate's entire upper body poking through the door of a locker if they look up or down. This definitely needs to be changed eventually, because while funny, it doesn't help the theme of this game being horror.

The way you move is definitely too slow. You move at a snail's pace, and ""running"" honestly barely has a difference that it may as well be the normal walking speed. Which is still too slow. I understand that I'm not running a mile in an open world setting, the maps are very contained, but it definitely takes away from the sense of realism. Realistic walking speed with no option to run would be better than this.

The controls need to be streamlined as well. I don't quite understand why E can't be both the interact and pick-up button, and I find myself forgetting constantly to press F to interact while I instinctively press E. And then left click is also an interact button for light switches, and to turn the camera on, which I don't understand either. These could all be contained in 1 button if the right rules were set to prevent them from overlapping.

Despite all of these flaws, the game is just fun. Talking into your mic to get the ghost to respond really helps the illusion that you're there. Using a walkie-talkie to communicate across distances with your teammates also sells the illusion, and what really makes it spooky is that when a ghost is hunting the walkie-talkie will frizz up and it doesn't seem like you can communicate with anyone unless they're near you.

It's also fun trying to deduce where the ghost is in a coordinated setting, and what to do to get it to respond, and what to use to make sure you're getting the right evidence. And even when you figure out what the ghost is, the match doesn't have to be over. You still have evidence to collect, pictures to take, optional objectives to complete, all for extra cash. You can leave whenever you feel satisfied...if you don't die.

The ghost will hunt players eventually, and the scene that plays out when you're captured is a bit spooky to me still. You'll also get flashes of the ghost to witness their whereabouts, or hear them whisper in your ear, or make creepy grudge-like noises, or they'll turn a radio on or call a telephone or you'll just hear them taking a damn step. And it keeps me on edge and on the lookout. Having to rely on both audio and visuals helps solidify the experience that you're a paranormal investigator.

Emphasis on investigator, by the way. NOT a ghost hunter. You're not stopping whoever this ghost is, you're here to get evidence, survive, and get paid.

I don't even really have a whole point to this review, it's just a bunch of rambling thoughts I have about the game. It's amazing with friends, even strangers, and $14 is a steal given the replayability.

Community is decent, only was told to leave a lobby for whatever reason once I joined, one time. A few recommendations to the Devs is to differentiate a little more on the physical characteristics of each ghost. Give the Banshee characteristics of that of Irish folklore and the Oni that of Japanese folklore. Adding characteristics to the ghosts might give away what type of ghost it is, so this might be a touchy recommendation.

I've played this in vr and pc, in vr the game is quite buggy but the dev is working to fix all of the bugs like the unable-to-pick-things-up-off-the-ground-glitch. I do have a question though; is it a bug if you die and all your stuff goes away, including the ones you purchased several games before? or is that a glitch. Thats pretty much it basically,
Pros:
1. Fun solo
2. Fun playing lan (no headache)
3. Fun playing with randoms
4. Getting money is a fun challenge and playing different games, maps, and playing against different ghosts keeps the game fun and scary
5. Vr support is really good (I recommend playing this in vr) but I play it in pc mode most of the time
Cons:
1. The glitch where you die and all your stuff that you bought goes away glitch is annoying
2. Still quite buggy but it is in early access (added pro: the bugs get patched very quickly, and since it is early access it will improve)
3. Starting out is quite a pain because only one person gets a flash light while everyone else gets stuck with a black light or nothing, (this isnt really too big of a deal if you start playing alone or in public mode because people usually buy flashlights for you and give you money by doing tasks)
Personal bug report
1. The glitch where if you die you loose all items
2. There is a glitch on the farmhouse map where I think its to the left of the farm house in the utility or tool room the door that leads outside is locked, this isnt a problem but when the ghost opens this door it remains open ONLY on the nearest person's screen meaning that they can phase through the door while others are locked behind it hand prints often appear on the other side of the door also (This glitch has happened to me specifically twice, once in vr, and another in pc mode.)

Overall though the game is fun, I only have a few hours so far and havent even touch larger buildings yet. There are a few bugs but that is early access but overall it works well.

75,Phasmophobia,76745642,english,"This game is amazing for Youtube and Twitch. In the last three days I have spent 33.6% of my total time playing.

Pros:
VR: This game was made with VR in mind. The tool belt allows you to turn on items and use them while using your hands for other tasks. You can use an emf and spirt box on your hips while holding a uvb light to become a one man army. In VR you can use both of your hands and it makes the game much more interactive.
Movement in vr is smooth and has options to allow smooth locomotion or teleport for more comfort. I find the teleport to be very jank to use in game and would rather take the motion sickness hit than use it.

VR jank: I have had issues walking through door ways in VR. Sometimes my body gets caught on the door and it just holds me in front of it. I have clipped into tables, been thrown under the level and received a one way ticket back to the van. I am using the Oculus Quest with PC link and have had issues with certain items on my left tool belt not being able to be picked up. The item just sticks to my belt teleportation between my hand and the belt. 

Dynamic and localised sounds! This game has a wonderful use of localised sounds where you only  hear the sounds happening immediately around your player, including the voice chat. Certain levels use echos to increase the dynamics, items like balls bouncing down the hallways cause a ripple of echos that you may here on one end of the level and a friend hears it on another. The game will play audio through the side of your headset that the sound is coming from and works wonderfully in VR and on PC.

This game is much better with a group! I have been playing in 4 player private lobbies and public lobbies and have had a great experience in both. P.s. if you want a private lobby make a private lobby don't kick players for joining if your lobby is public. The more players you have the more complex strategies you can preform. With a member in the van you can monitor several area of the map and it makes the game more interactive and exciting when everybody has a job to do. 

Big spoop: This game has an amazing atmosphere where you are listening to everything that happens around you waiting for the ghost to strike. The subtle sounds such as clock tics slowing down when the ghost is near,  the creaking of stairs under your feet, and the door jiggles all add to the atmosphere of you being inside of a haunted house. Listening to the ghost hunt you down and their feet stomping behind you gives you a rush and is a wonderful experience

The price: 15$ CAD for this game is a steal, I am glad the developers priced it as so as it helped encourage me and my friend group to buy it.

The lobby has some good distractions such as can stacking and basketball.

Constant updates: This can't be understated the developers for this game are pumping out bug fixes and mini updates and i'm glad they are keeping the content flowing.

Cons:
Audio glitches: Some levels start with members not being able to hear everybody else, it is normally 1 player not being heard, or 1-2 players not being able to hear others. Re launching the lobby often fixes this glitch.

Render glitches: Large maps can sometimes cause item tearing on items that are freshly rendered into the game. This may be an issue with my GPU being too weak.

Missing rewards and items: In multiplayer matches the players that aren't host can occasionally miss the reward for finding the correct ghost type. Items that we bring in sometimes don't appear with us in the van, other times leaving levels makes us lose items. Our group is consistent with bringing everything we brought in to the level back to the van. This increases immersion for us and we are aware that dying looses the players items. 

Sometimes the ghost is a little b*tch: On small levels with 4 players we can be chanting the ghosts name in every room just waiting for the first response. This can lead to us waiting in every room for sometimes upwards of 15 minuets before seeing any evidence. 

Game storage: The game stores the game locally on your PC so if you are going to switch to your laptop or other PC make sure you transfer your save data. This may become an issue for cheating as it will be easier for players to abuse cheat engine if the files are stored locally.

Recommendations:
Allow player modding.
Allow PC players to hold active items on their belt similar to VR players.
Allow players to view controls in the level.
Allow players to open the journal in the lobby.
Candles can be formed in a pentagram so summon a demon or trigger a ghost event.
An item that triggers a ghost attack on the item and can be used to distract certain ghosts.
Houses that have no ghost.
Rats and crows that make large shadows on the walls and make sounds.
A sound system in the high school the ghost can use to taunt the players.
A record players or music box the ghost can mess with in the house.
An outdoor graveyard or trailer park level that has you walking between buildings.
A ghost that takes the form of an animal such as a dog.
In higher difficulties make it mandatory to bring all of your items back to the van or risk losing them.
Possible support for 6 players on large maps.


This game is great on PC and VR. It is well worth the price and I am excited to see the game develop.
What are you waiting for just go get the game!

Pros...
-Can play with non-vr users to allow you and all your friends to get the shi*t scared out of them
-Incredible deal for the price, worth way more IMHO
-Gameplay mechanics keep the game from getting boring and repetitive, a big feat for a game of this style
-Scary, scary then more scary... 14hrs in and I'm still screamin like a baby
-In VR there are definite jump scares, despite some reviews stating otherwise
-Its like the show ghost adventures except you can die, your not spray tanned and you dont need roid rage to get the 
 ghosts pissed
-Intelligent ghosts that can recognize what you're saying and hunt/f*ck with you appropriately 
Cons
-small things like trouble picking stuff off the floor in VR and some minor non-game breaking bugs seldom occur
-pants need to be changed after every session, dehydration may ensue from chronic self soiling

I was in the tutorial house, read the tv prompts and ya'know it was creepy and all. then i go to the nursery which is where the ghost was supposed to be active. over the span of like 5-10min i was trying to set up equipment and get some stuff to complete the tutorial misson. im alone and its creepy but im telling my self its okay. i sat in a corner staring at the crib talking into a ghost box (a thing used to communicate with said ghost). THIS IS THE TUTORIAL mind you. You ever get creeped out and start talking kinda cocky-like to sorta pump yourself up?

The variety is also incredible, making for immense replayability. There are a reasonable amount of maps, but each one has many different locations in which activity may be focused. This, paired with 10 different types of ghosts means that no two matches will be the same. 
I think the best way to convey why this game is so excellent is to present a few of my most interesting situations...

-Hiding in a locker while a demon is on the hunt, hoping it won't hear my team yelling ""Are you alive?"" over my radio.
-Walking into a house and being scared out by footsteps running towards me not five seconds after stepping inside.
-Asking, over my mic, ""Where are you?"" and hearing ""next... right next..."" over the spirit box before a shadow walked out of the wall next to me.
-Watching my friend walk into a room and then realizing something followed him in only feet behind him after a footstep appeared in the salt he had dropped.

The fact that Phasmophobia is able to deliver this kind of gameplay, completely unscripted, is remarkable. Multiplayer horror games don't usually stay scary when you've got four people working together, but this one almost always does.

This game has tons of potential and updates to work with. It is still in early access.

Issue: The tutorial I feel could be way better. My friend joined for the first time and literally did not know what to do. He had to be told by his chat on stream how to play. Other than that, I don't see a way for this games tutorial to actually help you except save you some time by starting the training and immediately quitting out, alt tab to a Youtube game play and learn that way.

In Game Issue: My friend literally can juke the ghost mid hunt by running around a couch while he's being chased.

Thoughts and Feedback: It can only be more immersed in its interactions. Instead of activating the ghost instantly, fade in and fade out the ghosts.. Make objects float. Sometimes the ghost appearing and standing there for a couple of seconds breaks the immersion because my friends and I are teasing it and making fun of it. This game is scary, not because of jumpscares but by the ambience created. Creaking sounds, knocks, steps and what not. Gives anyone anxiety. So I would say, just make it more immersed.

Also add rotating cameras with 60 to 70 degree vision cone.",1601347855,1601347855,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,76,3,789,789,660,1601772744,,

We chose the school as the map. (one of the biggest maps in the game, frikn huge! aaand nobody had ever played htat map either....)
When we finally loaded in, we were only two people.... the others had disconnected during loading...
But we wanted to try anyway!
This one guy that loaded in with me went on to be my beginners mentor basicly, tought me everything i needed to know.
After walking around the school for 20-30 minutes without finding anything, our lights start to flicker.
We emidiatly run inside a classroom, we close the door and stay silent as a mouse.
2-3 seconds after we close the door, we hear the ghost walk right outside it. It stops, for a while before vanishing.
After that, the ghost attacks happens every other minute, but we still can't find the damn source. 
So we grow tired and our smart asses decides to not give a fu** and charge the motherfu**er. 
This ends by me getting my neck snapped and my mentor running as fast as he can back to the van while saying calmly to himself: ""Fu** this, i'm out. Fu** this i'm out. Fu** this i'm out"" until he reaches the van and gets out:)

10,Phasmophobia,76738354,english,"After 10 hours of screaming and fun experiences so far, I have already recommended this game to anyone who'd listened! If you love horror games, just get it already. If you're on the fence, it's an extremely fun experience with friends (especially given the price), even if you find yourself doing ""van duty"". 

On that note, if you get stressed easily in horror games, being in the van and helping your braver ghost hunters navigate the maps (especially the larger ones) is a great way to experience the game without throwing yourself in the haunted landscape directly. I've seen plenty of paranormal events (as well as my friends -almost- dying) simply from investigating via video/head cameras. Because of this along other features, I don't feel like I've lost much of the game experience. So, to my fellow anxious horror lovers, give it a shot!

I do predict that the game will receive a bit of polishing as bugs show up, and I've only experienced one glitch so far (the $0 menu one, which was already fixed recently!) I look forward to seeing how this game grows, and hope that the map might eventually cover other regions around the globe (as well as more ghost types) to spice things up in future updates!

The fact that sometimes nothing at all happens is more scarier than things actually taking place. Other games rely on cheap jump jump scares to make you scream, and terrify you, but this game? This game doesn't need any of that. You know you're heading into a haunted house, you know there is a ghost in there, but you don't know if it's going to kill you or not. The fact you can jump in with three other friends is amazing too to share in all the scares, and thrills. I've had one really good scream in this game so far, and I except I'll be getting many more out of it as time goes on. It's only EA, but the game feels amazing to play, and the leveling system feels great in terms of progression, and upgrades.

I love this game and it's going to blow up. This is one of my absolute favorite video games and I cannot get enough of it. The developer keeps the game updated frequently and the love that is put into it shows. I love the idea of playing a horror game with my friends and being a paranormal investigator with them is fantastic. We are all searching for the unknown with some basic equipment.

The atmosphere is simply the best! It plays a very muted and consistent baseline for whenever you enter a house and brings an innate sense of dread just being in there. A feeling that you are not welcomed and that you do not belong there is all done with the room layouts and the sounds. The sounds and lighting bring out the uneasy feelings that remain consistent as you walk through the houses, asylum, or school. 

Going into any location will immediately start making goosebumps show up and the hairs stand up. One of the most important aspects of this game is it's lack of jumpscares. This game barely has any because the ghost uses sounds and lights, sometimes an occasional object thrown or a brief appearance from the ghost, but not directly hiding behind a corner waiting for you to trigger it's ""jumpscare events."" The lack of jumpscares makes this game more authentically dreadful.

I got this game just a three days after release and I have not stopped playing this game in my free time. I have been telling all of my friends about it and following the Discord page and even writing my first game review for it because I love this game so much. This game is a gem and it's only going to keep getting better. It would not surprise me if this game blows up and becomes available on all consoles.

This is 100% the best horror game in VR. It doesn't rely on jumpscares, it's just the ghosts talking to you or slamming doors and the chilling atmosphere. It has a few bugs like when you just cant hear your team: their audio is just gone. Or when some clipping things are done wrong like the van exit: you can get stuck on the ramp. Just minor things, this game is really good none the less!

Cons would be it doesn't control the greatest on the index so far, it looks like it was made for the vive; i'm waiting for an update for other vr controller to make it better. The slider on the index and the right joystick control the rotation so you cant rest your hand on it. Everytime you snap turn your screen will go blackish, (doesnt happen with smooth turn) and it is just bit unpleasent. You will also have to change the X Y & Z axis of the controllers so it matches your hand positions.

All of this will most likely be fixed or added in due time! 

But this game is actually really good! I haven't found many other VR players in this, it's mainly been PC users. But i really enjoy how this game plays!

More seriously, the game is good, really good. Especially for an early access game, honestly you can barely tell it's early access as it feels like a full release.

Keep in mind that all the pros and cons i'm gonna write are for my VR experience only as i haven't tried the game in flatscreen mode.

[h1]Pros[/h1]
[list]
[*]The graphics are good enough to be immersed
[*]The sound design is crazy good, it's definitely one of the best parts of the game and it's one of my favorite if not my favorite sound design in any horror game i've played ( and i've played a lot ).
[*]The gameplay loop is fun and challenging
[*]There is a lot of replayability as there is a level system, daily tasks and the situations are randomized
[*]You can play with your flatscreen friends even when you're playing in VR
[*]There is a lot of gadgets and almost all of them have their utility
[*]It's. Damn. Scary.
[*]The different ghosts all have their gimmicks and ""personality""
[*]The game runs really well on my setup ( details on my setup down bellow )
[*]The voice recognition mechanic is really fun
[*]Creating a lobby and joining your friends works flawlessly, even though i'd have liked to have a ""join game"" option in steam but hey, a 6 digits code isn't much to copy
[/list] 

[h1]Cons[/h1]
[list]
[*]You character is slow, like really really slow and you can't run. I know it's a choice by the devs but f*ck, when someone dies in front of you or a ghost is chasing you anyone would run...
[*]The door openings mechanics are not very intuitive
[*]In some places when you crouch the item is too low to be picked up, it's under the ""real life floor"", i'd have said that this is a problem in my vr config but every other game works fine in that regard and some places in the game don't have that problem like the hub so it's probably an issue in the game itself.
[*]There is a lot of vr glitches, you can pass through doors and walls in some maps ( not gonna lie it allowed me to not sh*t myself in some places but it's still a bug )
[/list]

I'd recommend this game to everyone, horror fan or not because the mechanics are really fun and surprisingly deep.

  Now on to the actual review part of the review. The sound design in this game is superb the locations have the ambiance that you would expect the floor creaks you can hear the rustling of trees or the sound of your footsteps on the ground all lend itself to the atmosphere that the game creates for you. 

      The gameplay for the most part this has been pretty good with all of the ghost items giving you enough clues to understand what it is you are supposed to be doing. 

        The visuals while lacking i think in combination with the sound design and the gameplay makes this a truly horrific experience to deal with on your own 

           Cooperative play:This is for me where the game thrives it's tense and scary playing by yourself but where the game shines in it's social activity in which three of your friends are going to be screaming at the ghost which one would think would detract from the experience but the sheer terror that is generated when you hear your friend scream cut short is far above anything i've encountered in single player

            The bad bits: as much as i love this game there needs to be one thing made clear this game is buggy and sometimes this messes with how the game behaves and with certain bugs can make a great game into a frustrating one and in my 20 hours i have encountered many bugs that have ruined the otherwise great game but i should also note i am willing to wait to see what this game will become so overall I would say buy this game if you like shows like ghost adventures or just want to hunt some ghosts with your panicked friends this game is fun for everyone.",1601019658,1601323834,TRUE,0,0,0,1,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,442,2,1547,1547,1225,1601706487,,

Do I enjoy this game? Yes
Could I recomend it in its current state? Fuck no.
Constant bugs, glitches, and general pain in the ass features make the game a test of frustration more than it is a horror game; 
A list of issues I've encountered thus far;
A group of three of us CANNOT play together; host or one of the players crash every time we try to launch; no reason given, can play in groups of two with every other player, when the third player tries to join, total game failure.
Audio bugs; players can't hear me, I can't hear players in game. really Ruins the immersion when you have to swap to discord. 
MORE Audio bugs; Spirit box outright not understanding you no matter how clear you say the words
Misleading features; ghosts that exhibit certain traits not exhibiting said traits; for example, freezing temperature and use of the spirit box not showing up, making it impossible to determine what ghost you're dealing with. 
And to top that all off, why the everloving hell would you tie a core game feature to the user REQUIRING windows 10 to play? Don't you think that limits your playerbase a bit?!
All in all; I enjoy the game, but the frustrations make it so I cannot with sound mind reccomend it to a friend.
REVISION 1:
As I said to friends; I'd review this comment whenever changes were made. To my surprise they have!
Most of the games bugs are either being worked on, fixed, or in generally at least noticed by the development team. 
In general the development team have been proactive in that the bugs I've listed are mostly gone; misleading features is still an issue, I still have issues with the Spirit box and my accent, And I have since had a few... Visual bugs to say the least.
However! The gamebreaking stuff HAS been addressed, much to my excitement, and I can happily change this review to a positive one in light of that.

50,Phasmophobia,76722615,english,"Ive been playing with my friends ( Funsfun and Juwuki ) this game is so fun. Incredibly interesting topic, and its a horror game you can feel yourself getting good at without it losing charm quickly.

Its got a learning curve though and while it is fun to learn I think its best played with friends.
Some tips:
- You don't need to collect all your equipment before surviving, if you survive you get it all back.
- Sometimes you don't get all 3 evidence, so get some then base it off their behavior.
- Use a crucifix in front of a room your pretty sure is the ghost room it should lock them down mostly (careful though theyre limited to only 2 uses now).
- Buy photo cameras so you can photograph more evidence, photograph everything, fingerprints, interactions, bones, the ghost if you can. It all gives you more money.
- In bigger maps rotate out a camera jockey who shot calls sanity, ghost interaction levels, and can search ghost orbs.
- If your flashlight and all lights are flickering, the exit door will lock so hide, either in a different room or a closet.
- Smudge sticks will delay the hunt allowing you to hide with a time period bigger than 5 seconds.
- 1-2 activity ghost is interacting or moving 4 activity ghost likely sees you or hears you 6-7 activity it shows its presence 10 activity is a hunt.
- Calling the ghosts name from the truck can still cause activity to spike so be careful of reminding your friends of the name, could accidentally initiate a hunt.
- Also the most fun experience is with a mic, but keep in mind the ghost is listening. if you've ever watched a paranormal show just use some of the common phrases you hear from that and youll likely get a reaction.
- Spirit box worst item, straight up so finnicky. best of luck getting it to work.
- Salt best item, helps determine location and makes locking down position much easier. <3

Each mission is randomly generated with a location (House, Cabin in the Woods, Asylum, School) (with more to come like Manor, Prison, Apartment on their roadmap). The ghost will be randomly located in one of the rooms, and be randomly selected from a list of 12 ghost types.

great ambience
great build up mechanic of activity
great feeling of not being welcomed
the whispering in the ears PERFECT!
The co-op experience gereat
played 8 hours straight
maps are greatly detailed
ghost interactions and voice recognition perfect!
overall experience 10/10

cons
optimisation, if you want to not crash create a shortcut , go to compatibility set full screen opp to off and admin on
the medium and large maps have up to like 200 rooms and is really hard for just 4 people maybe increase party size soon :)

some ghost like yurei and wraith sometimes dont kill in hunting mode idk why it happens on school alot

camera bug where switching camera in inv will switch van screen

you need some friends to play with , doing wth randoms is hard as they often leave when they cant take the horror lol

would really like to see more equipment such as the SLS camera and maybe the emf teddy bears would be cool

over all great experience

this game needs more content (maps,items,customization, etc.)
different death animations depending on ghost.
dud contracts (basically there is a chance a very small chance that the house you go to will have no ghost at all) i would really like to see this feature added.
upgrades for the truck.
a new and improved Quija board system (new animations showing players hands on board) 
batteries for flashlights this feature would add more punishment for using your flashlight unsparingly.

I've been searching for years after a good coop horror game, that does not live on jumpscares and is a genuine cooperative experience. I never imagined something like this, and this game is by far the best horror game i have ever played or seen.

57,Phasmophobia,76706130,english,"This is definitely Early Access as there are still a lot of issues that need to be iron'd out.

So what is ""Phasmophobia"" it's essentially a ghost hunters game. You got locations and hunt ghosts (10 different ones to be exact) each ghost has particular set of skills, strengths, weaknesses and traits. You need to plan, and prepare at all times.

This game can also be played in VR. 

While the locations maybe limited; there is still a whole lot of content here for just 10 ghosts which is nuts. There's a level system, dailies and check this out ""full voice recognition"" meaning you can actually use your voice to talk to ghosts with certain phrases - pretty cool right? well while the price point is legit; there are indeed some issues. Like for example, sometimes the ghost does not really respond to the spirit box - maybe it's because the voice isn't all that great OR if you are using group chat like Discord it prefers in-game; or maybe your not saying the correct phrase clearly and correctly? I don't know really; Funny thing is that you can still use push to talk and hear just fine. Either way this issue needs to be looked at because it ain't fun when 99.99% of the time it's just guessing from very little evidence.

Besides the voice issues. There are three things to bare in mind especially a particular issue....

1) Not every match is obviously the same. You must think careful what to purchase BEFORE proceeding onto the case because holy heck it can be a make it or break it if your not prepared; Hopefully maybe somewhere down the line a patch will be made for a small margin of chance.

2) You earn money for every Ghost haunting you solve correctly AND completing objectives and bonuses that may come along with it. And of course, there is a leveling system if you haven't figured it out already and in order to level up you must solve the cases correctly and complete objectives, etc. As i stated before

3) Very little accessibility options for the disable gamer. So if you are a disable gamer, and you really want to play this game; be aware there is very little room for fairness. There is no dialogue option choice when using the spirit box or call-out commands like in a Call of Duty game or R6: Siege. Everything must be done clear, concise through voice chat. Hopefully the developers will add this option somewhere down the line.

Overall for $14 it's a damn good 4 player co-op horror game. While the maps are limited, there are plenty of ghosts; and while there are dailies and potential whacky moments to be had; the voice issues, plus the three things that i have listed can be a make it or break it; especially at $14.

(Early access review made on 28 of september 2020)
I really think that's one of the best vr titles(at least for the horror genre). It brings the full potential of VR in most scenarios and immerses you in a spooky environment. It shines in some sides but gets a little buggy and immerse breaking in other(You have to give them a break for being a early access title).
++++PROS++++
-I really think all environments all really well polished with a good vibe in it. You will really feel you are entering a ghosted place with someone looking after you in each corner.
-The game mechanics are really great, it it a game you want to explore even if you are sh*ting your pants. (Almost) All tools feel useful and serve a purpose in the game world, you keep getting in doubt to what take with you and spend a good time in a ""planning"" phase.
-The character models are in an acceptable level of detail and the sites you go hunt have a good/above average graphics.

-----CONS-----
-The game still needs some performance fixes to get to it's full potential.
-It lacks some ""Must Haves"" VR features in 2020. Your hand is not in the same angle than your real hand is, the characters hand are always of the first character, even if you change it, the character doesn't closes it hand on grab, the index controller have no finger tracking(This last one is still common tbh).",1601286044,1601286044,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,136,39,919,919,476,1601773111,,

This game has a great atmosphere and interactions that set in genuine fear.

Its clever use of voice recognition and proximity chat cannot be understated and hearing my friends say ""well, it's got me, goodnight!"" has got to be the most harrowing but hilarious sh*t ever. 

For a game in early access, it's one of the most fun horror titles I've played in a while. 

With that, it is a game in early access and isn't entirely bug free or without some flaws. One time on one of the townhouse levels, my friend dropped an EMF reader and it disappeared through the floorboards of the porch. The levels, while varied and randomly generated, tend to blend together after a while because of the similarities that they have in both objectives and in design. 

Those are some of my opinions of the game and while I have some things to say against the quality of the title, they're purely my opinions and I don't think that your money or time should be misplaced because of how I said one or two negative things.

18,Phasmophobia,76699237,english,"Horrifying with intricate design, Phasmophobia pushes the boundaries of the horror genre somewhat with its premise of ghost hunting and deduction for the purposes of expelling them from haunted locations. All of the ghosts have their own traits and hallmarks, as well as how aggressive they are and what kinds of things they can interact with; the whole process leaves you feeling unwelcome and with the possibility of being hunted down and killed by said spirits you'll have to really poke and prod to get the information you need and get out alive.

Phasmophobia's design is intricate in the sense that it uses your microphone for speech recognition the entire time - while it is rather rudimentary how many phrases the spirits can understand, the game uses it perfectly to make the ghost interact with the location you're in and as well as to reply to your questions whether through regular dialogue or through specialised tools like the Ghost Box, and with the ghosts having their own ""hunting phase"" saying too much while it is active could lead to your untimely demise.

Multiplayer is...rough around the edges, but it works mostly as much as it needs to which is quite a plus considering the ambition on display here from but a single developer. Some ghosts will reply to everyone in the room, whereas others will only reply to people on their own - in fact ghosts hunt differently depending on the amount of players in close proximity so there's no real set ""strat"" to handling a hunt when other people are involved, and when the radio stops working and your flashlight starts clicking which causes you to lose contact with the boys that's when the genuine fear begins to set in.",1601277729,1601277729,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,286,17,1104,1104,785,1601767597,,

It's not the game itself that makes you scared, it's your own mind, the anticipation that something might happen, the fear of the unknown since there isn't just one model for the ghost or one place the ghost always appears. It's that uncertainty that gets your heart pumping and makes you scared to continue. Some ghosts don't give a damn if you're around others, and will haunt regardless, but others will wait till you're alone, and the latter REALLY gets into your head and causes you to try to delegate one of your friends to performing tasks.

My friends and I had few runs and I got 2 of my friends to buy the game, they skipped the tutorial and we did not get tanglewood as a map so I took them to the street house instead since I think it is the 2nd smallest map in the game. I opted to be van guy since I had most of the gear and did not want to die to a demon so I sent the 3 poor souls into the house with everything they need and I introduced them to their equipment,

During the first 5 minutes I walked in and placed a camera in my favorite spot, in the kitchen facing the piano/dining room. I then set one upstairs, some motion/sound/infrared even salt downstairs with glow sticks to check for prints, I then got cozy in my truck and sat there with the radio telling the crew if I see anything on sound/motion and if they see an infrared go off.

After flicking through getting nothing I asked if they had anything, someone asked me if I was downstairs because he heard something, I told him no and I checked the activity level and it was at 2 so it was pretty low and I didn't think much of it, I flicked through to the camera I was talking about and I saw this silhouette of a girl standing in the corner the wall outside the piano room, sitting in the darkness. Staring into my camera at a distance. I was speechless that a unity game could make me feel this unsafe from the truck, I didn't move, I stared at it and it stared back at me, after a few minutes it vanished and I saw my friend come into the room. I have never seen an event like that again out of my 20 hours of playing this game.

I have been ganked so many times and honestly it stays scary because it's unexpected and the atmosphere is spoopy af on it's own. There is bugs here and there but the devs are constantly updating and fixing them, I genuinely look forward to this game progressing because it's hell worth it. 

The only thing I hope to change, is the animation when dying. I know other people see it different, like you exploding or being choked/having your neck snapped, but it's the same animation for you and after dying a few times it's not scary and tbh I wish it was as scary as being hunted, or having to stand still and silent while something breathes down your neck. Overall one of my favourite spoopy vr games <3

Terrifying ambiance? Done.
Terrifying enemies? Done.
Voice communication and voice recognition? Done.
Co-op/cross platform (with VR)? Done.
Variety that drifts from the cookie cutter jump-scare garbage? Done.
A sense of stress and suspense that hasn't been felt since Alien Isolation? Done.
Fun with friends while also experiencing the horror together? Done.

This game is the best experience for you as a solo player or with friends. Take up to 4 people and work together to find out what exactly is haunting these suburban households and rural farms. 


Edit: the recent update making leveling easier was a blessing from the gods.
Especially because this is in early access, I see unlimited potential for this title. The maps are stunning and really set the tone for the investigation to come. Eerie door opening leads to you biting your nails hoping there isn't a deadly ghoul on the other side. Lights flickering and paranoia combined with the shrieking of banshees and mares will have you checking your closet before bed. 

Keep in mind, this is all coming from someone who has only played keyboard and mouse. If you have a VR headset, this game is a must buy. 10/10 in the horror, fun, and content. 

Haunting's are always different and will have you on your toes the entire session. You will never see the same kind of ghost in the same room doing the same effects/events twice. There is so much randomness to the maps and enemies that it creates a sense of controlled chaos that is very, very hard to control. You may think you have the ghost figured out, but something may happen on a camera that changes your entire theory making you start from almost square one.

I must warn those who think they will walk into this game knowing everything, there is a HUGE learning curve. If you fail, and you will, try again. Even with no friends to play this game, there are plenty of servers to join and people to meet. As long as this game is supported by the devs and the community, it will be around for a long time to come along with it's player base.

One gripe I have with the game is the menu's though. Other than that, this game has a lot of potential.

Also just a quick addition, being able to call a ghosts name through your mic and having them respond using the map is the coolest thing I've seen all 2020. Amazing/10",1600490901,1601272713,TRUE,2,0,0,2,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,75,12,1363,898,565,1601849180,,

88,Phasmophobia,76695322,english,"This is one of the best horror games to come out this year, with the name meaning the fear of ghosts i was hooked I clicked on this game, had a look at some comments and reviews and after being impressed i brought the game, plugged my VR headset in a jumped right in and after 32 hours of game-play i finally had a review. Keep in mind this is in early access and i will explain some things about in being in early access

Environment
The environment in this game really sets the mood the ambience changes as soon as you walk in the building making easy to hear anything, a clock ticking in a silent room makes you feel uneasy sometimes making you want to go back, i do believe this game holds a solid environment for every map it has so far and more in the future.

Gameplay
The game-play is solid and doesn't let you down giving you all the right equipment to find and figure out what kind of ghost you are looking for, i've had stuff thrown at me or in the room, ive had door open or close in front of me, i've been growled at chased, hunted, this is a great scare, using your microphone to talk to the ghosts is really smart and creepy knowing they can hear you at all time and saying the name which is randomly generated making it angry, this game will never let you down if your looking for a scare.

Early access and bugs
This section is going to be talking about the future of this game, this game is in early access so there are bugs but they aren't game breaking and don't happen often so you might get a few bugs, but this game is constantly getting updated to fix the issues. Now there are currently 2 farm houses, 3 street houses and 2 Large maps a high school and a Asylum, and more are to come as again in is constantly getting updates from the dev.

My personal ideas
I grew up watch ghost adventures and ghost hunters so i was hooked already on this game but there is some equipment they use that aren't in the game so here is some things i believe should be added. number 1 is a thermal cameras you can bring and look through or only on the van monitor. They should also add a sound system to the video cameras so you can hear whats happening in the room, like if the EMF is going of or its talking through the spirit box. Now with maps i feel there should be medium sized maps i have a really cool idea for a mansion to be added or a old castle.

Community
I've meet some great people and people i play with almost daily now and it is fun with friends, this community its built so far is amazing super nice people and funny and its always fun to hear them scream from another side of the map, you will meet some people who might seem weird or annoying but its still the same scary game.  

Conclusion 
This is something you should definitely add this to your cart if you love horror or your interested in ghosts, i love both so this was instantly in my cart. Now it being in early access should not stop you from getting this game it is always fun to come back to so get it try it and if you don't enjoy it refund it. i was going to leave a review sooner but i didn't have much hours. SO in conclusion... get this game what can i say its amazing for a horror lover.

Rating - Sound a bit crazy but for me i give it a... 10/10 and with more updates and bug fixes daily, I expect big things

Pros: 
-Definitely spooky for sure
-Ghost variety
-Dynamic situations based upon location, ghost type, difficulty, and team size 
-Practically endlessly replayability
-Even after you clock a few hours and the game becomes not as scary, the investigation aspect is equally as enjoyable
Cons:*
-A few bugs such as thermometer readings going through the floor so you may thing it's upstairs but it's actually in the room underneath, random loading issues where the game crashes upon loading into map (Very rare for myself but I lost my equipment even though I didn't die :/ ), Spirit box can be a bit hit or miss sometimes but you can get a hang of it after a while.
*While there are a couple bugs, the dev team are extremely quick and have literally been putting out hotfixes almost every day (Just make sure to update every day before launching). You can see the bug fix description in the phasmophobia discord in which the devs are very interactive.

Ghost hunting has finally become a science you can practice digitally. Very fun and looking forward to more, it shows great promise but already has enough going on for it to justify the price.
NOW on to the more specifics.
Stuff like this is why early access exists. While animations can be goofy looking and the VR mode still needs to be worked on pretty heavily (would not even attempt to use a HMD oddysey with the current control scheme, couldnt find a way to change controls) it still manages to bring through 2 very important things. Atmosphere and replayability. This game can be pretty scary, especially early on but then you meet a seasoned ghost hunter who knows how to decipher all the haunted shit going on in the house and you start to pick up on what ghosts do what. I do however wish some shop items where cheaper like flashlights and basic materials. I look forward to seeing this game continue and definitely dont reget spending the cash on it.

Only bugs my friends and I have had is the ghost got stuck one time during a hunt and other time one of our players was seeing a different head-mounted camera to the rest of us. 
Aside from that, it's been loads of fun.

From 'easier' ghosts that aren't super aggressive, to ghosts that care only about scaring you shitless and trying to kill you, the reactions and situations you'll find yourself in this game are priceless. 

The game doesn't really hold your hand past the tutorial though, from what we've found. Haven't been able to get a Ouija board to work, and understanding the Parabolic Microphone has been met with mixed results. All the other equipment is pretty straight forward though and easy to use.

I don't know if it's a bug, but whenever returning from a ghost hunt, the host sometimes changes and there isn't currently a way to transfer host. It's not a bad thing if you're playing with friends, obviously, since you can just discuss what jobs to do.

If you can stream this, or play with someone that can, I'd recommend that. Not only so people can also bask in how terrified you get, but also so you can clip awesome, bone-chilling moments to rewatch later.

Well at time of writing I'm almost level 80.

I have mostly overcome my fears, and my skills of master ghost hunting are basically complete.

But there are still moments where I am super spooked. Being alone in a house trying to aggravate the ghost is not my favourite thing to do, but it must be done.

Technical:

An impressive game for 1 dev. Dev is actively bug fixing and communicating with community on Discord. It has ironing out to do for sure, but at the rate the dev is catching issues and providing fixes, it is no concern.

Currently some of the bugs effect gameplay. Some evidence mechanics occasionally don't seem to work properly. This leaves my friends and I having to sometimes troubleshoot our way to guessing the ghost type based on ghost behaviour and the evidence that we can prove we DON'T have. Works 90% of the time. This is more of a notice than a complaint, as I know it will be fixed, and once it is I'll edit this section.

The tutorial doesn't tell you everything. We learned a lot through looking into forum discussions, from other players, and experimentation. Some more official documentation would help new players, but I think some level of trial and error should exist to maintain the feeling of discovery and also added anxiety.

Appeal: 

Visuals aren't mindblowing, but nothing to complain about.
Atmosphere seems very well tuned. A hair raising combination of light, sound, and physical environment. 

I've been having fun playing with friends, guiding noobs, and watching grown men scream.

A fun selection of equipment to use for tracking down ghosts and evidence.

29,Phasmophobia,76622012,english,"Shortly after going through Dead Space 3 with a friend, I took to Discord and rambled on about how much I [b]need[/b] more decent cooperative horror experiences. A couple days later, another friend told me about ""this new game where you investigate ghosts with up to 3 other people"", and before they finished explaining what it was, I bought it. 

[b]Here are the Nifty things I liked, and the Lame things I didn't.[/b]

[h1]The Nifty[/h1]
✪ Playing this game with friends is a blast, especially if at least one of them get spooked easily. Hearing their reactions to ghost encounters, and how their voices can actually be detected by the game, is an absolute treat.

✪ Each level's design is top-notch, with excellent space utilization, lighting and interactivity.

✪ Ghost hunting wouldn't be fun without a decent variety of tools, and this game provides. It also helps that every mission features a different ghost with different strengths and weaknesses, so learning how each tool works is a necessity.

✪ The journal, which helps you find out what ghost you're dealing with and serves as a hub for your clues, is a really nifty progression tool. It's also nice to see how it automatically eliminates the possibility to guess a ghost that doesn't fit with what you've discovered.

✪ No matter how much I'd love to think that I've been desensitized to fear in the vast majority of horror games, almost every round of Phasmophobia makes me feel uncomfortable and anxious. The unpredictability of each ghost, especially once you get out of Amateur difficulty, in intoxicating spookiness at its prime.

✪ Voice Recognition is usually a pretty big miss in most of the game's I've played that support it. There's either no true benefit to using it, it serves as a forgettable gimmick, or it just doesn't work at all. Phasmophobia not only nails the execution of voice commands, but makes it essential to the gameplay loop in a horrifyingly immersive way. I'll never forget the first time I called out to a ghost and it said it was behind me, or how a friend said they were scared, and a ghost threw something at her. 

✪ For a game that looks and feels very VR focused, it runs smoothly in Desktop mode. The keyboard and controller bindings are simple to execute and easy to remember as well, making it enjoyable no matter how you prefer to play.

[h1]The Lame[/h1]
✘ Having a flashlight on your shoulder whilst holding an even better flashlight doesn't make much sense to me, and feels like a wasted equipment slot. Maybe, instead of essentially having two flashlights, we can just replace the flashlight on our shoulder with whatever one we pick up in the truck?

✘ Large maps are way too big to be enjoyable, and I don't think I'd be able to navigate them without having a person in my group who stays in the truck. Perhaps Medium maps could be considered the new Large, and the new Medium could be something between the starter houses and the High School? If that passes, perhaps maps like the Asylum, which is considered a Large map, can be dubbed Extra Large instead.

✘ There are a few little issues that aren't bad enough to be considered serious, like: not being able to access the controls during a mission, muting other players, Options menu adjustments resetting after each round and a few glitches that will likely be ironed out as the game goes.

[h1]Overall[/h1]
I usually try to avoid Early Access titles, but after Phasmophobia's convenient release, I couldn't help myself. Fortunately it ended up being worth every single penny, and I'd be willing to dish out more money for it in a heartbeat. With the right amount of dedication, thorough fan feedback and a dedicated base, this could end up being one of the absolute best (multiplayer) horror experiences of all time. Here's hoping it keeps gaining traction!

[h3]NOTE: This is an Early Access review, and I've yet to play in VR, but plan to within the next 30 days.[/h3]

58,Phasmophobia,76667521,english,"Well worth the price, and a very promising game by Kinetic Games.

The horror in this game is well executed, and is mainly conveyed by the atmosphere and sound environment. 

The lighting compliments the eerie tone of the game, and is one of the best aspects of the whole experience at the moment. It is well crafted and believable, adding to the immersion. The bigger rooms swallowing the feeble light of your candle or flashlight elevates the sense of space and loneliness to a whole another level, making the danger lurk not only behind you or around the corners, but right in front of you.

The gadgets and minigames tied to them are entertaining and don't take from the experience. Most gimmicky of them is the spirit box that you use to talk to the ghost. It is not always clear what you can ask or if it's working properly. It would be a good idea to expand on it, making the questions somehow tied to other phenomena happening around the haunted location. If the ghost breaks stuff, you could ask if they are angry for example. But all in all the gadgets bring purpose to you being in a haunted building, and the tasks force you to move on when you feel scared. And get eaten of course. 

VR in this game works very well, so well in fact that it is the best VR horror experience I have tried. Many objects are interactable and fully modeled and textured. You can light candles that your friends are holding and the gadgets work when stored on your belt as well, so physics are well thought out. The game does not take away your control at any point for a pointless cutscene or animation, and it does not control you in any way when danger approaches. You are in control, yourself, alone, without any safety nets. Hide or die. Excellent understanding of game design and VR as a medium. 

The money system and levels work as a great way to convey progress, and I am excited to see the system expand with more equipment and locations. I wish some kind of an upgrade system was implemented as well, where you could bring more equipment to the locations. I really love the glowsticks but you can only bring two. 

Surprisingly, the ghosts themselves are the worst part of the game right now, and I would work on them asap. The suspense and outright terror of the unknown (or impending doom) carry the experience well, but when you actually see the ghosts they are a letdown. For the player models the goofy Cry Of Fear-esque models are sufficient, but the ghosts really need to be more detailed. More animations, better models and for some of them a more disturbing way of movement. Keep their traits and expand on them, you have a great base already. As for how they are now, a seemingly stock animation of a middle aged dad on a leisure walk stapled on a goofy zombie model is not scary at all. It's too humane. Crawling, floating backwards, twitching, keeping disturbing sounds etc. are more fit for ghosts. Of course, for some better than the others. I like the idea of diverse ghosts, I'm not saying they all should be generic Grudge-girls. Just make their motives unearthly along with how they conduct themselves. The ghost hunters should not understand them, neither should the player. And in my honest opinion, remove the flickering in and out of existence. It's fine if it happens on camera, but not when you are directly looking at the ghost. It really reduces the scare factor and reminds you that it's just a game. Plus, it really doesn't seem to have a purpose at all, unnecessary things are almost never good for a game in the first place. If the intention is to make them harder to see, just make a separate ethereal form for them or make their movements less predictable. 

Some actual problems I noticed while playing the game:
- Grouping up is maybe a bit too powerful of a tactic. I don't know if the A.I. breaks or what, but we have not yet been killed once when sticking together as 4. 
- A small area inside the doors leading out is considered outdoors. This affects communication, but more importantly breaks the ghost. If you hug the door when they are chasing you, they cant path to you. You are always safe near the door, and it takes away form the experience and immersion. I have confirmed this behavior in the large wooden house and the school map, but it might be a problem on all of them.
- The area where you have to point the VR controller to speak through the radio is a bit too small and gets displaced when you crouch. It's a bit too tedious to use at the moment, even though the idea is great. Just make the area larger by a fraction, it should fix it.",1601225498,1601248723,TRUE,1,0,0.523809552,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,138,27,819,819,299,1601718365,,

Pros:
Amazing Co-Op.
Creep factor done right.
Good Graphics.
Sound Design is creepy AF!
Proximity and voice chat help the immersion a lot.
Just fun as hell.

Cons:
Bugs. Some ghosts don't really play by the rules assigned to them or straight up refuse to give you the 3rd evidence no matter how long you stay or what you do. The chat also can just not work. Not the worst, but can make gameplay worse.
Walking speed. You walk like an old granny and jesus is it annoying on large maps such as Asylum or High School.
Lack of explanation/understanding for aspects of the game. It can be difficult to understand how to do things or what means what exactly. (Off the top of my head, I have no idea if you can remove a head mounted camera)

Unlocking the door, you walk into a dark, empty home and make your way through the rooms, waving your trusty EMF finder. You get some readings in a back washroom, so you put up some cameras, maybe a book and candle, and investigate further. The teammate in the van says he's got some orbs on camera, then suddenly the candle goes out and the lights flicker.

You and your buddy take the initiative to get some more information. Going in with the spirit box, a camera, and a crucifix you try to speak to the ghost. ""Daniel Martinez, are you here with us? Please give us a sign."" Suddenly, your friend jumps to the wall, the door slams behind you, and you are now face to face with the undead.

Quickly grabbing your crucifix you thrust it at the demon yelling ""THE POWER OF CHRIST COMPELS YOU"", then watch it turn towards you, the lights flicker off, and it says through the spirit box: ""Man door hand hook car door"". You fucking shit bricks and your buddy didn't even get a photo of the damn ghost.

72,Phasmophobia,76683910,english,"This game is great, but currently it has some issues with the movement in vr going up slight inclines that makes it really annoying. Even smooth inclines like the ramp for the truck can cause people to get stuck and you'll have to move at an angle to continue moving up it, same with the stairs. If they worked that out it would be a solid 10/10 for me. I'm looking forward to the additions they bring to the game, tons of possibilities. 

Also, this game has no level based scaling for which types of spirits you encounter. You would think that weaker/less aggressive ghosts would be more common, and the more dangerous/erratic types would be rarer. But that's not the case, you could be level 1 with other people also level 1 and get a demon, or an oni, back to back jinns. I really think it's just random. As I write this I'm currently level 20 and my experience has been mostly Jinns, Onis, Poltergeists/Banshees pretty much tied, rarely a regular spirit, phantoms somewhat common, shade here and there. Yureis and Mares are extremely rare in my experience. So I figure that which types of ghost you encounter is based on their characteristics alone, and the difficulty of their characteristics is what you see when going into the job.

One other thing, currently there's some sort of desync issue with the ghost orbs. Sometimes people see the same ones at the same times, others though, someone will be able to see them but no one else will, the intervals and positions will be off, making it harder to identify which type of ghost you are dealing with. I considered maybe it was due to a sanity difference or something but it just seems to be a bug. 

Currently there is only one type of voice that can come over the speaker box, not a big deal, but it hurts the immersion a little. 

And you can have a female named ghost but the apparition won't resemble a female at all once it manifests. Sometimes it does, it's just something I personally wished was a little more consistent. Sometimes they appear as children-like manifestations, but the voice is always the same guy. I'm just saying, if it was a child's voice coming over the speaker box I'd s**t myself. 

Good game nonetheless. Keep up the good work guys.

Some ideas I had: Since the game can recognize your microphone and speech. Maybe you could add an attribute to a ghost where it will capture phrases your teammates say (Locations, yes or nos, etc) and play them back at times a teammate will ask a question to lead them astray, perhaps a ghost that targets solos.

Maybe some writing on the wall, cabinets that open and shut suddenly, just some things to consider.",1601246607,1601246607,TRUE,1,0,0.523809552,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,111,6,3698,3698,1761,1601960017,,

The game is a bit like a horror game of co-op clue, hear me out; You go in with a group of people, you collect evidence, you try to survive by working together which helps you get more clues as to what the ghost type is, then at the end after collecting enough evidence it points all fingers at only one possible entity. It's fun, great for communicating and socializing and facing the primal fear of what's lurking in the shadows together.
It took me a while to figure out the controller buttons ... so here, this may help until they add a controller map:
Left Analog Stick - walk (Press and hold in ""L3"" to ""run"")
Right Analog Stick - looks around (Press in ""R3"" to crouch)
A - action button (hold rotates items you want to place / tap, looking at a camera to turn it on or off)
B - cancel (or back out button) also drops/gently tosses held objects
Y - cycle through inventory)
X - pick-up button
RB - (hold) speak in your walkie-talkie
RT - Activate held item
LB - (hold) speak out loud (proximity chat)
LT - Place held object (this replaces the ""toss"" option that the ""B"" button offers)
D-Pad Up - opens and closes Journal (the ""B"" button does not work for closing the journal)
D-Pad down - toggles flashlight in your inventory on/off when holding other items
(I haven't found a function for D-Pad left and right buttons)
Menu/pause button it the middle right black button (I don't know its proper name)

Pros:

- 4 player co op
- Can get pretty tense/spooky even in multiplayer
- Fun finding out which ghost is there
- When something actually happens it is great
- Graphically, the environment looks good
- Great concept
- VR support

Cons:

- Tutorial doesn't tell you nearly enough which leads to a lot of experimenting/figuring things out which CAN be fun, but is mostly frustrating
- The end of a mission is pretty anticlimactic
- The character and ghost models look bad
- The characters move SUPER slow
- There isn't much of an indication of success
- Sometimes it is way too hard to find the ghost

Recommendations:

- Make the characters move a bit faster
- Get some new character and ghost models
- The game currently feels like it is missing an act. After you find the ghost you just leave. It would be cool to get some sort of post discovery mission to get rid of it or fight back somehow
- Add some sort of mechanism that aids players once a lot of time has passed if they haven't found anything.

5,Phasmophobia,76462932,english,"One of the best VR horror games in my opinion, the atmosphere is on point and gameplay is alright but could be a bit more refined.

Remember those corny ghost hunting shows ? Well now it's for real, Chose a location and investigate the area. Your looking for proof of the paranormal and trust me when I say it's present and executed perfectly ! this game does a fantastic job of sending shivers down your spine by using good scary tactics and not constant jump-scares. Gather information, complete quests and discover what ghost type it is from the random 12 currently in-game.

With a bit more polishing and getting rid of bugs this could be an absolute game changer.
The psychological terror part / early game is fantastic but could have a bit more added too it, the hunt section could be better, here are a few suggestions:

- Fade in and out effects and animations for all Ghost types.
- More animations in general for Ghost movement.
- More death animations and finishers for all Ghosts.
- Visible death animations on the human side
( seeing your teammates getting killed in glorious fashion)
- Getting items thrown at you, furniture pushed etc
( also the poltergeist being able to lift you up )
-  More models for the ghosts

Sanity System Suggestions:
With insanity going up / sanity going down, you start freaking out
 (All of this is Local / Individual player point of view only, nothing server side)

- Seeing smoke or darkness coming from under doors 
- When opening doors bugs crawl from some doors to your hand area
- Hearing voices non related to the current ghost you are gathering evidence for
- Lights seem to go off, pitch black (but its only local so your there screaming ""in the dark"" while your friends wonder why) for a few seconds
- Getting transported into a ""upside down"" version of the map where you need to complete a survival mini-game to come back to your senses / reality
- Taping on windows but when you look it's a tree branch
- Seeing the faces of your teammates distort into a ""Ghost like"" appearance / Morph

I only encountered a few bugs:

-Falling through certain maps in certain areas
- (VR) Item belt not following you around properly

Make sure to share this game, and hopefully with sales the Dev's can get a full team working on it !

(I will be updating my review with the development of the game and adding suggestions)

65,Phasmophobia,76675905,english,"What a game for people who love a scare!

The game is currently in Early Access, but it's a solid release. It runs butter smooth, barely any issues and more or less, the issue's with the game are around motion like characters animations and little bugs. Nothing major!

Graphics: The graphics are actually alright, not amazing like Battlefield but there are decent to look at with some great visual effects and overal a nice 3D rendered aspect game that is nice to play and look at.

Audio: The audio in the game is massively atmosphere based, so you need sound on to listen and proceed. It does have some weird audio effects but they just work and the audio is spot on from stamping to the ghosts running, to floorboards creeking, to pictures falling, it's all really great audio that brings the game to life.

Controls: SUPER easy to pickup and play, but a long time to clean your underwear when you move to far forward and something happens. Easy controls in VR and desktop version.

Gameplay and every else after: So the game supports VR and Desktop so you can play VR, a friend can play in desktop mode, which is amazing and we need more games like this.

Doing so, it's based around ghostly investigating. You spawn in, after your've purchased a whole bunch of items and then set to 5mins before the ghost stuff starts, it's your time to quickly invenstigate and find the cold spots, marks, anything strange before the different type of ghost appears and then really causes spooky stuff.

You can die and when you do it's freaky, but when you do die, you can see the ghost spawn and chase or stalk a friend. Which is helpful but you cannot do anything so yeah. Try to survive!

There is talking in the game, you can communicate with the ghost with a variety of commands found here:  https://gamesgds.com/phasmophobia-all-questions-and-answers-ghosts-ouija-spirit-box/ - Which is a super helpful page.

It has some neat features like saying the ghosts name toooo many times angers them and they come to kill you in the most freaky way. It's all down to get in, get solved, put the information in your journal, not get to freaked out because it does effect your character sanity and then get out, end mission for cash. - That all being said sounds easy but trust me, it's not!

The game does not have any jump scares with anything jumping out to grab you. It's massively atmosphere like paintings falling, items being moved or thrown, doors opening and closing etc.. You do hear and see the spirits and they are freaky but it's how they appear, which is why I do not want to spoil anything but if you want a spooky ghost game to play with friends and something to really scare you, better than anything that has been released recently. This is 100% the game and 100% recommend.

Also, the devs are active to reply and update the game so I massively suggest checking this gem out!",1601235406,1601235406,TRUE,4,0,0.583333313,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,2131,194,704,704,258,1601930880,,

This is a game I will for sure be coming back to again and again. I highly recommend buying this game, and support the devs so they can bring more content and fix bugs! 

I do have some problems with the game, but that is to be expected with an early access game. It needs some work on in game mechanics like placing things down, or lighting candles if your not in VR. Sometimes when placing down things, it'll clip through objects or the floor and then we cant use the item for the rest of the game which in turn causes us to lose out on finding certain evidence.

This game does not tell you almost anything about how the game works. It's 95% trial and error.

What is considered a ""spirit box evidence""? Is it just hearing a voice? Is it seeing/hearing something happen after you told it to ""give you a sign""? You will never know, because it's not properly explained.

How exactly does the crucifix and smudges work? You will never know because the game gives you next to no information about it.

You can only hold 3 items at a time, which is incredibly dumb even from a balance point of view. Apparently backpacks or pockets weren't invented yet.

The descriptions of the various ghosts are too vague most of the time to tell the difference between them, especially if you didn't get any evidence for 10 minutes.

Half the times the ghost will spawn inside of you and you will instantly die, without having any chance to hide. And half the time you take a photo of the ghost it doesn't work.

Oh yeah, and if you're talking to your friends on discord, prepare to never get any result from the spirit box, because apparently you need to hold the ""local voice chat"" button for it to work in multiplayer... And of course, the game doesn't tell you anything about it.

Also you're at a huge disadvantage if playing on desktop, compared to VR, because why not.

So much information is hidden from the player that the mystery stays palpable after hours of replaying similar missions.

I wont try to spoil gameplay wise too much but i will say even with the safety timer still up you never truly feel safe even while its counting down, the biggest part that does me in is situations where the ghost will only communicate when people are alone, like that already isnt the biggest red flag to be thrown up, along with maps that are massive in size. To make a long story short you cant put into words what the situations are like in this game its almost too difficult to give any kind of an explanation with all the variety that can happen with no experience (in my time of playing at least) always being the same. All in all i would say this game will be one to watch for sure the dev, yes you heard it correctly one dev. with how he keeps improving this game. If you are very easily scared or even a big brave dog this game does have something for everyone going back to earlier you will know how i am with the genre of games and even i still had a fun time with friends playing this. My final thoughts is: this game is actually a blast to play, didnt realize me and my friends played for about 5 hours straight, if you are easily scared its better to play with friends rather than alone, the biggest part is to keep an eye on this game because not only is the price of 13 dollars well worth the admission, its also easy to see that the dev put a lot of time into this game to make it what it is so i will say my hat is off you sir nicely done

10,Phasmophobia,76671217,english,"Do I recommend this?  It's a little hard to when I just almost had a heart attack.

Sitting in the bathroom on the floor, cramped between the bathtub and the sink, this particular ghost doesn't respond to groups.  So I had to be alone.  We needed one more piece of evidence to complete our investigation.  It was either orbs, which we hadn't seen, or a response through the spirit box.  I had the box.  So there I am, in the small cramped bathroom.  My companions has wandered down the hall away from me.  I sat there alone, door open and I could see down the hall.  I was incredibly shaken as I'd just been chased out of that same bathroom by this little girl ghost, Lisa Moore.  I did capture a photo!  Our first.

There I was.  I turned off my flashlight, only able to see the faint light from the outside creeping into the small window.  Okay, time to talk.  ""Lisa, are you hear?""  I could see my breath in the freezing air.  This was definitely where she haunted.  ""Lisa Moore, can you show yourself?""  Suddenly the lights flicker on and off.  Then the door shuts on me.  Knowing she was close, I started to panic.  I couldn't see her again after the first sighting!  ""Please don't be here..."" I thought to myself.  Then a growling hiss shot out at me from the darkness!  My heart burst through my chest!  I couldn't stay cramped in that tiny room with her, not again!  I crawled to the door, yanked it open and ran like the dickens out of the house!  I couldn't go back in there, ever again.

I've played all of the ""scary"" games.  99% are not scary and go with cheap jump scares.  Fatal Frame was a difficult one.  Fatal Frame 2 is the only one I couldn't play, at least alone.  This game, I dare say put the scare on another level.  It was so scary to me that I'm not sure I dare recommend this game!  I swear for a moment my heart hurt after that encounter.  Thinking of having to do it again, I just didn't want to.  But that's why you're hear!  So yes, it does what you're looking for!

There are some issues, and I doubt they'll be changed in Early Access if ever.  We did maybe 5 investigations and they all went the same way.  Go in, set up a couple of things, get some evidence, get killed by a ghost.  Even though they were different types of ghosts, it was the same routine.  It would be neater if each investigation was VERY different, maybe solve a murder mystery, find the lost buried body, help a ghost cross over, maybe do an exorcism.  I doubt this game will become that.  So it will likely get repetitive and loose it's fear luster quickly.

The animations are crappy.  I doubt they'll ever improve.  Sounds are good, but there needs to be more variety...maybe a kid laughing as it runs away (maybe I haven't played enough to hear these).  Controls are a little quirky, having up to 3 MAIN controls for items.  I think they really took VR into consideration with these.  Menu systems are also quirky, probably made for VR.

So, it's early access, it shows, and most early access games really don't improve.  Sadly, I doubt this one will improve much either.  I hope I'm wrong because this game does have a unique flavor that I hope to see realized.  It's great for a handful of hours of terror.

I've always watched ghost shows and having the opportunity to play a game that has the equipment that is used was super exciting. I was worried that it could be limited since it is Early Access but the different type of ghosts and different ways to find evidence puts a lot of variety to it so it doesn't get old.

Probably the biggest one of my complaints is investigating big maps. Since you have a sanity bar and the less sanity you have the more the ghost could kill you, and with different ways to lose your sanity (i.e. complete darkness) it takes a while to find the ghost's room and locate your evidence. But honestly, this could be due to me not understanding the game fully right now and maybe my friends and I are approaching it differently. But regardless, it's a small complaint and something that won't ruin the game for me at all. Another small complaint is the spirit box/voice recognition. Again, it could be me not doing it properly but I don't seem to have a lot of success using it which that is one of my favorite equipment to use.

I can't wait to see what kind of updates they give this game cause it is already so much fun. It would be cool if they allowed more players for those bigger maps but honestly, I can't think of anything else they could add (besides new locations and equipment). 9/10 I would give this game.",1601223213,1601223213,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,258,6,598,598,470,1601519459,,

20,Phasmophobia,76650101,english,"This review is just gonna be some suggestions i have about the game, granted, after 20 hours of playing, I still love it and its the best use of $10 I have spent in awhile.

1. Holy water would be a great addition to the game
2. Smudge sticks need to be nerfed, you can prevent a hunt for the entirety of a game if you bring 4 and have one person with a lighter and a stick at all times.
3. Add more ghosts and add more REAL lore! i am a huge Supernatural fan, and I would love to put some of that knowledge into the game.
4. Add more distinctive traits to each ghost. The base is a great start, but I feel like there is something missing to just getting into the routine of checking this and that and then running around looking for stuff to take pictures of.
5. The Supernatural fan in me wants to be able to hunt the ghosts, not just figure out what the heck they are. This is your game, although I would love to have a ""storyline"" to each different hunt. Maybe starting out with a ""figure out wth it is"" mission, then a setup mission to set up equipment/acquire equipment in order to find the ghost, finally, a hunt mission. Understandably, this would change the entirety of the game, although I thought it was a really cool concept.
6. More items! I hate using the same 5ish core items to figure out what type of ghost i'm looking for.
7. More of a fear factor. Don't get me wrong, for the first 10 hours i was scared shitless lol, but after that my buddies and I kinda just run around, find the room, set up everything, figure out what it is, and leave. VERY LITTLE fear factor considering we have smudge sticks at the ready after the 2 minute timer runs out, not to mention scattering crucifixes to the point where we only get maybe one hunt each game on Professional difficulty.
8. Something more to work towards. This further elaborates on everything said above. The game is find ghost, maybe get scared, get paid, rinse repeat. What am I working for? money? idc, after 5 hours, all my friends had every item in the game and now we very very very rarely die, and even if we do, just a few hundred bucks and we have everything back. I desperately want something to work towards and I want an endgame that allows me to pour hundreds of hours into this game.
9. The visuals of the ghosts need a lot of work. If I'm hunting a wraith, I should not see a mf ghost walking on the ground towards me. Each ghost should have certain characteristics that stay the same with different models(maybe based on how they died in combination with gender/age) 
10. More sound effects! I used to get scared by the little breathing in my ear, but ive become accustommed to it. Obviously this will come with time, but a variety is definitely needed in a horror game.
11. LET ME SEE WHAT MY FRIENDS SEE!!!! In a party of 4, most of the time we will all need to be sitting in front of the monitor watching the same camera in order to see an orb. Most of the time, only one person will see the orb out of all 4 of us! Same thing goes for ghosts. Only 2 of 4 people will see a ghost in the same spot. This ruins some of the immersion for me, for I want to be scared when my friends are. This also applies to sound effects, we'll all be in the same room and one will ask if we heard a footstep or something and nobody else does. Definitely a change i want to see as soon as possible, for it is a big immersion factor when playing with friends.
12. Going off #1, I want to see a lot more items in the game with more organization options for moving things across the map. IDK, this will happen with time and I don't really have a solid idea for it, but I'm curious as to what you guys think.
13. More maps! this will come with time as well, but I want to see more 1-2 player maps for when my buddies aren't on and I dont want to play with randos.

I'm sure I could name a thousand more things I would love to see added to the game, but I love this game and I love the concept. I have so much faith in this dev team to push out more great updates to make the game long-lasting. I understand that this game is early access, but hopefully we will see some changes that allow the game to blow up in a way that people can pour hours into it. Biggest things for me is something to work for and a solid endgame. Thank you for an amazing concept and I love the way you are executing as of right now.

From messing around with your mates in the starting area shooting some hoops and trying to stack the paint cans. To spooky atmosphere, goosebumps, chills, whispers in your ears, and also seeing a quite wide variety of pretty scary looking ghost.

 The game does a really good job of spooking you without any cheesy jump scares or basically telling you that you should be scared. It has that atmosphere that gives you the thought of ""I shouldn't be here"" or ""the ghost is already mad at me"" I genuinely thought I wouldn't be playing this game for this long but it keeps on bringing you back for more. 

The in-game chat is so well done and well put together. I would seriously recommend that you mute yourself in discord etc whenever you are playing this game with friends it adds that slight part where you might actually be alone in this one room where your friends are somewhere else it just keeps the game spooky and fresh. With how much the dev has been fixing the game and adding quick little hot fixes, I really think this game is gonna take off and have a really good community.

36,Phasmophobia,76645717,english,"My friends and I have been playing a few hours now. We've managed to finish out a few jobs with a number of jump scares. Very well developed for the atmosphere. Only complaint I have is the loud annoying ambient background noise while inside the houses. Addition: We've also noticed that the standard Flashlight should probably be a default toggle option instead of 1 of the 3 inventory items. It takes up needed space and if you're holding other items, the flashlight sits on your shoulder anyway and can be toggled on and off with T. The Stronger Flashlight is understandably an inventory item since it is 'larger' in both size and light radius.
I haven't literally screamed out in fear since I was a child. I am 32 now. I am really glad I decided to buy this game after watching IGP. Something we've noticed though. Once you get the hang of how the game works, you can easily knock out most of the optional objectives and the entire job in just a few minutes. Also, we have run into an issue where we will collect 3 pieces of evidence and it will not show us a possible ghost type. We then have to risk increased chances of getting hunted to find a 4th piece of evidence to try and find out what we're dealing with. Along with this, we will gather 3 pieces, get the ghost type, turn in, and it will be the wrong type.
Example: One of the last jobs we did came up with EMF Lv 5, Freezing Temperature, and Ghost Writing. However, it didn't show us a possible ghost match. So, even though we were hunted twice with increasing activity the longer we were there, I risked my life to place a camera in her room. Found a Ghost Orb. Swapped Ghost Writing with Orb and it popped up Phantom. We turned in and the game told us it was in fact a Yurei.
Is there something we are missing or is this one of the downsides of Early Access?

38,Phasmophobia,76647458,english,"I recommend this game, it has the potential to be the best Horror experience in gaming, and the ""Overwhelmingly Positive"" review score would have you believe this is a better game than it actually is. 

This is as rough as a newly released Early Access game can be. If your group is anything like mine, you're going to spend 30 minutes just trying to get everyone in the same lobby and able to hear each other speak. If you're using the Valve Index like me, your experience will take you back to 2017 archaic VR gaming. Let me break down what problems I would like to see Kinetic Games address, and give my own positive experience:

-You must allow the Tutorial to be completed in co-op. 
-In lobby options needs to be expanded. Often friends will have to drop out just to change keybindings or audio settings. See the bit about getting the party to hear eachother above. 
-VR must be improved. Finger tracking needs to be added eventually. There needs to be a clearer indication to the player that they are speaking over the ""radio"" by bringing their left hand up to their ear.
-The objective/progression systems needs to be improved. Your progression is tied to how many objectives you clear, but I had many cases where I couldn't even accomplish a single objective in an entire mission. An item you'd need for an objective is often behind a level requirement and a cash requirement. It makes the early game extra rough, when you understand it the least. 
-Movement is slow and clunky. 

I still recommend the game for the insane emergent gameplay. My team is trying to get a photo of this ghost, and we hear it stomping up from the basement. Already something that would brown my pants, is also invisible but a shadow cast by my flashlight. My EKG meter is going nuts. Then, everything stops, as... You should play the game, as this is a spoiler. The point is I freaked the F out. It is some of the scariest shit I've seen in a game, and you're denying yourself the same experience.

Lets set the scene. Me and a friend had done some work and figured out the ghost was a poltergeist, however we had an objective left ""Stop a spirit's hunt by using a crucifix"". We were going back in, and we had to anger this thing somehow. We went into the room the ghost was haunting and got everything ready; a spirit box to communicate, a crucifix and a flashlight. If only we'd brought brown underwear.  We went near the lockers and opened them up, ready to hide in. It was time.
We got near the ghost box and my friend said ""Show yourself"".... Silence... In defeat and disappointment I taunted the spirit. ""P***y...""
As soon as I said that, the lights went out. Oh no, footsteps. Out of nowhere this old man with a hatched begins striding towards us from the darkness, evil in his eyes. We both panic and run for the locker, fumbling and dropping our equipment. Squeezing into the same tight space, we slam the door shut and pull out our crucifixes. I'd dropped mine in fear, however luckily my friend still had his. We were safe

Or so I thought...

After the activity had died down we clambered out the locker and picked up our equipment, we were outa there! However, the ghost had other plans. As soon as we headed for the way out, the lights went out again. My friend was certain ""Everything was fine!"", however I wasn't so convinced. As I fumbled around with the door (pushed not pulled), I heard an unnatural sound, and his footsteps getting closer. A quick glance over my shoulder and there he was, coming right for me. I've never tried to glitch through a door faster in my life. He then disappeared into thin air, almost like he was scaring us out. I ran like there was no tomorrow, I was outa there! We both made it home in one piece, though in reality we were forever scarred.

~~Pros~~
- Both VR and Monitor support.
- Singleplayer and multiplayer support, the game still playing perfectly in both.
- Concept easy to pick up and understand, however new things constantly keep you on your toes (e.g. Mannequin moved between missions of the same map, freaking me out and mixing things up a little)
- Game really knows how to build up tension, like to the next level. Not seen any jumpscares as of yet.
- Voice recognition works and really adds to the immersion. Speaking to the ghosts and waiting for a response puts this game in a league of its own. (Note: mentioning that you're scared/or something is creepy at any part of the game will make the ghost more active, almost like its teasing you.)
- More unique maps like schools and asylums? Haven't touched them yet but damn they look amazing.
- variety of ghosts and spooks, have only experienced a tiny part of the game and I am already over the moon.
- Setting up cameras and watching them from the van is surprisingly cool and fun.

~~Cons~~
- Most of my problems with this game are glitches and minor things, which are to be expected with an early access title. (e.g. Dropping an item on the keyboard in the van or the car in the garage makes it impossible to pick back up.)
- INDEX SUPPORT PRETTY PLEASE (Being able to control my fingers will make everything so much more immersive)
- I can see the same maps over and over again getting repetitive. Maybe a randomly generated house would be a good idea? Keep things fresh. 
- Walking in VR, I keep getting stuck on the floor and other invisible things. Really annoying when trying to run away from something spooki.
- Constantly needing to buy new underwear.",1601196614,1601197087,TRUE,2,0,0.545454562,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,348,3,1127,1127,385,1601956951,,

A strategy is formed: split up, place sound sensors on the east and west side of the ground and first floor. However, our radios turn to static as our flashlights flicker. One man separated, my buddy and I hid in the corner of a class room, huddling behind my crucifix. 

Our lost radio contacts means we can't contact our friend in the truck monitoring our progress. We think it's all clear, we step outside, start walking to the exit; our flashlights start flickering. 

We're being hunted again. We retreat to our corner classroom to huddle behind our crucifix, as footsteps get louder and louder outside the door. We don't dare speak. Finally, a chance occurs to escape by darting out of a fire escape and across the school grounds.

We made it. We're back at the truck, and learn that the one friend who got separated didn't make it. Reunited with our friend in the truck, we decide to keep calm and carry on. 

As we re-enter the school, our plans come to a halt. Our fallen colleague, who got separated earlier, is lying dead a few paces from the door. So close, yet so far.

Our flashlights flicker again. We're being hunted again.

96,Phasmophobia,76640910,english,"So this game is in early access which is partially why I'll be giving it a yes as the Devs have a lot of space to expand and improve. The game is a lot of fun, can be shockingly tense and scary despite being multiplayer, and it overall a great time. If the premise interests you I'd say you'll have a great time. However I want to go into depth where I think the game can improve so the devs can see that little piece of feedback.

First, repetition and longevity:
The game begins so strong, and it's a lot of fun. However within a few hours, and once you figure out certain things about certain items, it becomes routine to an almost saddening degree. This is how every hunt will go, regardless of spirit type. Scout location looking for EMF or temp readings, upon locateing the ghosts ""room"" drop a crusifix inside of the room and run back to trunk, unload as much junk as you want in the room, scanners, cameras, etc. Then proceed to antagonize the ghost either by being in the room or talking to it until you complete objectives and know what it is. That's it. No matter the spirit the core gameplay becomes identicle, the crusifix is your get out of jail free card, when it's down you can't be killed, and with that in mind it makes the gameplay extremely straight forward. However I don't think just weakening that item would fix anything, in fact I'd argue changing only it would make the whole game worse, and that is because...

The spirits. This style of game is going to rely on one thing more than anything else, and that's the enemies. The ghosts are what provide the gameplay and the variety, and right now it's simply not there. I saw the list of spirits and my mind went wild with the possibilities for what they could all be, how they could act, the amazing, weird things I might encounter! I was wrong. The spirits all act extremely similar if not the exact same. If they manifest theres a VERY small number of ways they can look, none unique to themselves as far as I could tell. It's always a bloodied person walking or a shadow person walking. That's really it no matter what mythical spirit you're brushing up against. This lack of variety along with how little the difference is in how they act in gameplay is truely a shame as without the variety in the spirits it makes that core gameplay feel even more drastically samey as you grow accustomed to the things that can and will happen. The only real differences are how often one spirit or another may do something. Otherwise they all do the same things, just some more than others, and the difference can be hard to pin down because of this homogenized style. This needs fixed, badly.

The other half of this equation is something more nuanced that I don't know how to label. Let's call it...

Gameplay focus/rewards and difficulty

So this is also something the game feels direly lost about. My friends and I played for 8 hours all told, in those 8 hours we only had a single person die. It was on our very first hunt. Since then not only has noone died, noone even came close. After a while the spirits begin to feel almost toothless as you understand the mechanics, which thus far don't go too deep, and realize what different signs mean. Now this may not sound like a problem, ""Of course I'd die less as I get better!"" But that isn't how it felt, we hadn't really gone from clueless to pros after that single first hunt. It's just too easy to survive, the spirits often feeling, as said before, toothless. But I know why this is. You lose all items but the default ones you get given to you that you brought on a mission upon death. So the devs have gone with a system of high punishment, low reward, and lower threat because of it. It's almost how minecraft treats death. Sure you lose everything when you die, but you will basically never die if you're careful.

I don't think this style fits this game. UPon winning a hunt, say a small hunt, you get base 40 dollars, plus an extra 20 if you got a photo of the spirit on still image camera. 60 bucks for hunts that can take some time. That's not enough enough for 2 doses of pills to restore sanity (which are consumables and are spent if you die or not). It buys you one video camera with no tripod. What I'm saying is the payout to missions is almost comically low to the points you can't restock lost goods all that fast should you die and lose a lot. I currently take enough gear into missions with friends that were I to die it would take me literally HOURS of real life work in the game to re-earn what I'd lose for one failure. Now, I understand what the devs hoped would come of this system, they hoped the threat would increase tension and make it feel scarier, making the threat of death a genuine concern. But that's now how it feels in practise. In practise it instead means that I just play it safe, follow the formula mentioned in a prior point, and never really have to worry. The system meant to add tension instead adds none, really.

The solution here I think is to revamp this structure. To begin with a game of this nature having some kind of rogue like/survival reward structure simply makes no sense to me. You're playing because it's fun to hunt ghosts, not to buy one more camera every hour. But I also think revamping this system would be important for one other reason; if the punishment for death is less dramatic, then you can ramp up the spectral aggression which would make the core reason you're ACTUALLY here more fun! There's a few ways they could go about changing this. one is to massively improve payouts for missions so replenishing lost goods isn't hard after a death. Another would be to simply not take things from players upon death, perhaps you only lose items if EVERYONE in the session dies, but not if only you personally do. Whatever form this change would take I think this is extremely important because being able to ramp up the activity of the enemies AI would make for much more exciting gameplay, without feeling pointlessly punishing since, as I said, the current progression system doesn't do anything to make the game feel better to play, it's more of a hinderance and a bother.

Overall though this is a strong foundation. I wish the devs well, but those 3 kind of points are key to making this from ""good for a few hours"" to ""Great, let's play this a ton!"".

The enemies are the crown jewel of this kind of game. Make them unique, visually, mechanically, structurally, push what makes each one special.

The core loop is too similar hunt to hunt, add variety, drive decisions that will pull players into different action than simply camping one room of a house.

And restructure or remove the needless progression system since it's presence has knock on effects into the gameplay that can not be ignored.

OH and PS. increase the damned move speed. It makes the game absolutely unplayable on lager maps, takes it from a fun, spooky experience to a torturous slog. The fact there even IS a sprint button is baffleing as it's only a fraction faster than not sprinting. Make the current ""sprinting"" the default run, and then make an actually quick moving sprint, as it is there is NO reason not to hold down sprint for the ENTIRE game which is wildly uncomfortable  over extended periods, and considering there is absolutely no downside to sprinting that just leaves even more reason to perpetually crawl at the ""sprinting"" pace. Please improve movespeed.

43,Phasmophobia,76637373,english,"Already a promising game in early access.

Even with plans to introduce more content in the future, the current set of equipment, maps, and ghost types allow for near infinite replayability. Earning money and leveling up based on identifying the ghost and completing optional tasks enable the player to be more tactical as they continue to play. A new player will start to recognize the flow of the game, starting with preparation and then evidence gathering, in a way that will force them to take some risks, let their Sanity drop, and, if they're particularly unlucky, get killed by whatever ghost they're trying to find. However, the unpredictable nature of each Contract, as well as the limited visibility and mobility of the players, ensures an experience ranging from spooky to terrifying every single time, both on desktop and in VR. Nothing has ever made my heart race so quickly as rushing out of a farmhouse after seeing a ghost, only to hear my friend scream through his radio as he was killed, listening to him get cut off as his dot on the map vanished and Total Activity dropped from 10 to 0.

There is room for improvement, though. The VR controls are a bit difficult to use at first, and some other issues arise, such as not being able to pick up items from the ground if the player's height isn't finely calibrated. Additionally, the tutorial will require an update at some point. Despite being given the location of the training ghost, a lack of labels on the map display inside the truck leads to confusion if a ghost isn't in an obvious location such as Kitchen or Living Room. Labels may also need to be added for larger maps such as the High School and the Asylum which have many similar looking hallways and rooms, and possibly to all maps in general to help communication between random players, who would be more likely to go off on their own without coordinating.

Overall, Phasmophobia provides an enjoyable ghost hunting experience, which will only become more entertaining and replayable as it progresses through early access, and eventually reaches full release.

In terms of jumps scares, it isn't your typical ""open an door and jump out"" kinda scare, it's much more psychological than that. Say if you start at Intermediate difficulty, a lot of the time, the ghost will give signs like EMF readings, temperatures, very subtle to begin with. However depending on how you play, i.e. calling the name out a lot, or using a ouija board a lot, it can change very quickly.

The game is absolutely worth it for the £9 I bought it for and it keeps me entertained for hours with my pals. It's amazing with the voice detection feature too, to the point the ghost actually listens to practically everything you say. No level is the same either, it's always a different ghost, different spawn, it moves, it flies, it groans at you, it hunts you...

My best moment so far is definitely when we were searching a house for a ghost, and a buddy of mine came along saying ""he's in that room"", to which I replied stubbornly ""no he's not in there lmao"", buuuut the moment I opened the door and walked in, I heard a groan in my left ear so I quickly turned to see where it was from, next thing you know, my mouse flew across my desk and my heart was racing.

- Relive your favorite 90s Paranormal investigators TV shows through their eyes in a world where ghosts are definitively real.
- Co-op does not make this game less scary but most certainly makes it funnier. 
- More atmospheric horror than jumpy. 
- Will shave years off your lifespan.

Cons:
- Can be visually glitchy; occassional awkard movement and animation might tear you out of immersion.
- Not sure if intentional but apparently friends don't always see what you see. (This is a pro if it is intentional)
- It's E.A. You'll run into some funny weird bugs: like when you die but you still have full control of your character but can't interact w/ things.
- Cops might get called to check up on you and knock aggressively on your door at 1 AM if your neighbors hear you screaming for your life in genuine terror.

We managed to get it right a couple of times (the ghost hunting bit) and we went a couple of levels up, really satisfying.

The graphics are not that super wow but good enough to feel right at home in the game (I played the VR version).

There are still some minor bugs (like some people cannot pick up things that are fallen on the ground) but it is easy enough to play around those and the dev is really into fixing things and from what I read on the community forums he is really active.

Because the game makes you feel actual anxiety and fear. There is no jump scares, no sudden flashes of adrenaline that quickly fade.

You're not jump scared very often, but it's scary in a much better way which I'm going to try to explain. Imagine this:
You're running around a house trying to find evidence about what type of ghost you're up against (Main task, lot's of exp if you're correct) and suddenly your flashlight starts flashing a lot, this means the ghost is out to get you, and since you don't know what type it is, you don't know how to protect yourself. If you manage to reach the exit, tough luck, it's locked until the ghost stops hunting you. Also consider that some ghosts run faster than you do. If you have an EMF reader, and it's the right type of ghost, it's going to hit it's highest reading and beep loudly as the ghost chases you. Maybe you had a thermometer which could show a negative celsius, meaning the ghost is close. There is also a spirit box you can use to ask the ghosts questions, and if you're lucky, you'll get an answer. A UV flashlight will show you handprints on the doors, and a camera show the invisible ones hunting you. There are a lot of different tools to use, and only three of them will yield results as each ghost has three evidences you must find. This is the charm of the game, as you don't know which ones will give you what you need. You could be hunted even if the EMF reader shows nothing, or the temperature is normal, if it's a certain type of ghost.
And here's the big deal, you got big reason to survive, as you'll get far less exp, and also lose all the items you brought with you to the mission if you die!

Negatives:
It is hard to complete objectives in the Abandoned School, the map is super big, and if you don't have big enough balls to walk around on your own, you won't complete much. The difficulty for that map needs to be higher.
Ghosts need to start scaling with different maps. Sanity can drop very fast on different, and larger maps, making it difficult to complete objectives once again. 
BALANCE. This game still needs some good balancing in general.
Some bugs need to be fixed. 

Overall, this game is on the fast track of becoming popular, it is 100% worth it if you love being scared with your friends, or have the balls to do this alone.

Couple things I might suggest are:
 - Ghost appearing slightly more on camera, more apparitions. (shadow figure, walking across the hallway, etc)
 - More activity such as banging on the doors or walls, voices, objects being flung or moved, maybe even one floating/rising?
 - More models, death animations
 - New and improved maps, and hopefully ones that could support up to 8 friends if possible? (Hospital, Carnival, Mansion, Factory, Hotel, maybe even a cemetery?)

I really hope this blows up like Fall Guys and Among Us or at least gets the devs enough to keep going and keep adding more and more haunts, equipment, investigations. 

The greatest mechanic is the voice in game speak with ghosts function which really adds to the atmosphere. For those playing on DISCORD or any other voice app, do yourselves a favor and mute on Discord and restrict yourselves to ONLY the in-game voice.

98,Phasmophobia,76611740,english,"I've played it a bit and I've gotta say, especially for early access, it's a fantastic game!
Ghost hunting, naturally exaggerated in the psychological horror style where not only do you get a ton of activity, but, naturally, the ghosts will try to kill you every now and then.

Tutorial covers basic button layout, but does not cover how to survive a hunt. Basically, if your flashlight is blinking, find a closet, locker, *something* to hide in, and hope for the best. If none are available, then run to whatever room you can find and try to get as many doors between you and the spirit as possible. And keep your flashlight off, if you can.

I am having a massive, game-breaking issue every now and then where I'll be disconnected by client timeout every game I join and I've no clue when it's safe to try again without being booted halfway in the game. This is very unfortunate as I've yet to see any ""how to""s to fix it. I'm keeping it updated, as best I can, but it proves unreliable often.
When I do successfully play a game all the way through, though, and up until being booted on unsuccessful games, I am very satisfied with the game. I'm very hard to scare and even I find it eerie as all get-out. If you have a friend who is disappointed by most horror games they play like myself, have them try this, they may not be truly ""scared"" but they'll likely be kept on edge. Can't wait to see what the 'official release' of this early access game has to offer!
Before I buzz off, for all those new players looking for 'amateur' difficulty but finding games hosted as 'intermediate' or 'professional', the only difference is your grace-period when you enter the house.
Amateur: 5 minutes till the spirit will periodically hunt you
Intermediate: 2 minutes till the spirit will periodically hunt you
Professional: Its fair game from the get-go. Watch your back.
Beyond that, I am sorry to say, amateur is as dangerous as professional if you're trying to take photos of the ghost or stop a hunt with the crucifix (it has to be in the spirit's room and near the spirit BEFORE it enters hunt mode, otherwise it won't work)",1601144191,1601144191,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,52,4,2913,2809,1994,1601787995,,

Being able to investigate the property, with random people or people you know brings this game to the top. The ways to investigate, how to approach a certain Ghost and house gives this game levels. The thought of some people being a VR and some not is also amazing (instead of separating the two). The in-game audio for local and radio chat also is a great addition and brings the game to life.

The price is ridiculously low, I would personally pay more but like it at £10.99 as more people can get it! I cannot wait for further updates, this game has got a lot of potential for properties, gadgets and other customisation. After I asked a couple of people to play this game, they absolutely lost it, and got scared, one even ALT-F4'd out -- it is scary.

I have been wanting to play more and more of this game and wanted one like it. I have played this game on my VR headset, Desktop and old laptop. The laptop required turning settings down and still ran okay and my desktop ran great (textures etc are on point).

My only ""issue"", will be the tutorial (this is me trying to find an issue) -- it is okay but does not walk you through finding the Ghost room, what to do in ""the hunt"" and other essential things...perhaps we should look it up or work it out on the go?

With all that said, would recommend to buy, if you have a group/community...it is relatively cheap so would invest in it.",1601134777,1601134777,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,91,1,2007,2007,304,1601954311,,

The game has great replayability and never once was I getting bored. Overall, probably the best VR horror game out there that has co-op.

There are a few negatives, though, like my progress when playing with my friends did not save, you have floating hands that can phase through walls, and there are many bugs I've encountered, like getting stuck on stairs or getting stuck on the ramp off of your truck. The game doesn’t need full VR physics(as it does have realistic object interactions, it's just that your hands are floating and phase with no collisions), especially when that’s not the point of the game; however, it is 2020 and VR is blowing up at the moment. I just expected a little more; however, I do not know the size of the dev team nor do I know what they plan to do with the VR physics in the future. The game is fairly recent and bugs are to be expected, so that is excusable and as people have said, the devs are constantly working.

66,Phasmophobia,76598051,english,"Played both in normal and VR mode with friends and I can safely say this game is downright amazing!

You play cooperatively as a group of paranormal investigators to discover what kind of ghost you have on your hands. 
The tension builds slowly as you try to find small clues with your various gadgets and also try to determine which room the Ghost is actually in. 

The more time you take, the more dangerous it gets. Your sanity will decrease and the ghost will eventually try to hunt and kill you and your team. 
What was that noise upstairs? Who turned the lights off? Did something just move over there? Oh god my EMF reader is going crazy... **** RUN IT'S BEHIND YOU!    It's terrifying.

In VR the experience is enhanced tenfold although it was a little clunky at first. 
The tutorial is also a bit slow and confusing but through playing you can quickly learn what each item does.

Overall Phasmophobia is brilliant horror game. Grab a friend or two and jump in!
-The option of VR and non VR is great. 
-Not reliant on lots of jump scares but a steady progression of horror.
-The use of voice recognition throughout the game is something that I've not seen before and works wonderfully. 
-The devs seem to update the game constantly which gives me hope for more bug fixes and content. 
-Playing co-op with friends can give you so many funny moments.
-Great price for the content you get!

Sitting in the truck and observing the situation is fun when you have setup your fancy equipment around the ghost area. 

What I would like to see is more unique, clear and consistent ghost type characteristics with accurate descriptions of them.

It's good that in the recent update Wraith no longer leaves foot steps behind.

10,Phasmophobia,76588248,english,"I'm super in love with this game right now. I'm a huge fan of horror and games that make me just super scared and don't rely on cheap jumpscares. As it stands at this stage of development. I'd say it's very solid and the dev is keeping everyone up to date and the dev even has a trello of what is coming, working on, to do and the like.

I would say it's worth the price, hell, I'd say it's worth 20 dollars as of right now, definitely 40 when there is more time put in and more places to hunt and more item and such. I digress though.

Pros in my opinion - 

No cheap jumpscares. The fear relies on the location you are at, 
the ambiance of your surroundings.

Lighting and shadows.

Co op doesn't take away from the fear which is rare.

Item diversity and their uses. 

Character models because some of the moments with their movements are hilarious.

I don't have many cons to the game. it's more personal gripes for me than overall gameplay.

You can only have 3 items at any given time, one in your hand, two on your belt in the desktop version. You lose EVERYTHING you brought when you die, even if you leave stuff on the truck. You do get like a 60% insurance though so it's nice. It's easy to miss little things if you rush around and in the heat of the moment when being scared and hunted, you miss a lot but again, it's a personal con, not an overall flaw to the game.

Anyway, I'm done ranting. This game is great, especially if you have a friend or two and want to really do something for a youtube video or a twitch stream. This is a yes for me.

-Check ghosts name and objective
-Grab things you need (usually just like a picture, an EMF reading, finger prints)
-Walk into one of three house/buildings
-Press V and say ""John Jackson, show yourself.""

Alot of the mechanics are spot on with only minor bugs that I've seen that the Dev's will most likely fix thanks to the community that tells them when bugs pop up. The Dev team seems to be very active.. To best describe this game you are a Paranormal investigation team that goes into places looking for enough evidence to then be able to send in a team of people to remove whatever is there. You get this evidence by setting up cameras, taking pictures of potential clues of paranormal activity, etc. Lights will flicker, cups and knives will randomly be thrown. It's accuracy to what people think when they think of the Paranormal, is very accurate. If you have friends IRL that can play this with you it""ll make it that much better. Some of the ""Ghosts, or Demons"" prefer only one person in the house when they are being contacted, so send in the person on the team that no one likes lol. They'll be in for a good time for sure.

58,Phasmophobia,76579765,english,"(This review is only the VR version) 

these devs are definitely on some opp shit.

As of my last time playing (Sept. 25 at around 11pm) there are a few bugs that need to be fixed, such as randomly getting stuck on nothing. However, I saw a dev comment that this is being fixed already. Another major bug is the audio occlusion on voice chat. You may notice that your teammates voices get muffled even if they're standing 2 feet away. The reason for this (I assume) is that the game thinks you are two different 'areas', and applies occlusion to the voice chat to give the impression of you being in different rooms. If this can be fixed, it would be a great improvement. I'm not sure if this game uses Steam Audio, but I would recommend it if the devs can do so. 

Now for the positives:
This game is absolutely terrifying, I've legit never screamed during a horror game before this. Even with a friend I am still too scared to walk into the rooms that the ghosts occupy. The fact that the ghosts react to your voice as well is an amazing decision. Huge props to the devs for that inclusion.

Overall, this game has a very bright future. As long as the major bugs get fixed, this will definitely become a must-play for anyone looking for a proper horror game in VR.",1601101740,1601101740,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,398,22,1078,1078,118,1601862293,,

The atmosphere is terrifying, and I love the concept. I hope we get many more jobs to investigate. I don't want the variety to end! 
The grudge noises some enemies make made me poop myself.
The graphics are decent (for unity). I really wish it was made in unreal engine.
A few things I would love to see:
-More inventory space, 3 things is not enough. 
-More hiding spots in some of the maps.
-Better payment system. A higher base pay for completion of the job and the optional task should be just bonus cash. 
-The oujia board was a little glitchy, set it down and couldn't pick it up again.
-It would be amazing if we could be the evidence gathering crew and the removal crew. I want to fight these a-hole's. ( you could at first make the objectives be finding out what kind of ghost we are dealing with and then once that's completed the objective becomes cleansing the house.
-Some subtle creepy appearances would be great, to build up to them attacking. I feel like you only really see them once they are trying to kill you, so it's hard to really look cause I'm running away in terror. Or hiding in the corner and dying. It would be so eerie if you are walking around checking stuff out and you just see them peeking around the corner and then they disappear. *shudder*

And ussually the most challenging part is finding where the ghost is on the building. This game has a bright future, and i would recomend buying it because it gave lots of fun hours with my friends. There are currently 5 maps in the game: three houses, one High school and one Asylum. And with 2 more maps in the making. The only complain i have are the character models, They are janky and weird, it's like your eyes are on their stomach. That is probably because this game was meant for VR, but i hope that for non-VR players they improbe on the animations.

87,Phasmophobia,76524943,english,"This game is extremely fun to play. Luckily my friends and I were looking for a co-op horror game right at this time and I stumbled upon this game. None of us regret it one bit. It's very promising for an early access game.

Pros -
While the game still has jumpscares, it doesn't rely on them very much at all, and instead relies on the natural tension of large, dark areas and the natural activity (or lack thereof) of the ghost in order to build suspense. This means, for me at least, the feeling of dread doesn't end up wearing off and I can still feel genuine fear when going on a new mission, even if I've been there 20 times before, while also letting those jumpscares still be somewhat scary. A win/win in my book.

The voice recognition is something I wasn't sure would work out to be very enjoyable, but boy was I wrong. It creates a great experience, actively speaking to the entity, trying to provoke it to show you what it can do, risking your life for the mission, but it's gotta be done. It's thrilling and fills you with dread. Having the mission react to the things you say is extremely immersive, one of this games biggest strengths.

Immersion as I said, is huge in this game. I always feel like I could actually be in the level. Especially if you are playing in VR, it's hard to be ripped out of the experience, even if you're fucking around with friends, like I was. Being able to be the one in the truck tracking movement and and activity throughout the location is just as thrilling as wandering the house itself looking for activity. It's been hilarious and immersive the several times my friend got impatient waiting for clues and went into the house to insult the ghost only for it to immediately lock the door and begin hunting him. 10/10

Cons - I don't really feel that it's entirely fair to list these as cons, as the game basically JUST came out as I write this, and I have very little to complain about and feel very positively about this game and it's future, but these are things to keep in mind, and that they may and will likely change in the future.

When playing in VR, you can hold a video camera in your hand and carry it around, and others can have a clear view of what you're pointing it at as you move through the house. I would like to see this also become a feature for desktop play, while you still can equip the camera and view it, the angle is very low and bobs sporadically, making things hard to see. You can buy a headmounted camera that I assume fixes this. I am not a high enough level to buy one yet so I'm not sure.

VR players definitely have an advantage in many scenarios as you can turn on equipment such as the EMF reader and the spirit box, then but them on your belt to use them hands-free. I would like for at least the EMF reader to do something similar, instead of turning off when you put it away. It makes a noise when you get a reading, and I think that could stay, while requiring you to pull it out again to see exactly how strong the reading is, I feel that would be a good compromise.

As for VR QOL, my only 2 concerns right now are 1. placing cameras. Currently you grip them by the left or right side in a set direction, and it's only different for each hand it's held in. It can make it difficult to place a camera facing a set direction. I would like to be able to grip cameras from a front angle, as well as from the top, in order to make placing them much easier. And 2. switching hands, currently you have to drop an item manually and catch it if you're fast, or pick it up off the floor in order to switch hands if you don't have room in your belt. Many other games allow you to grab object out of your other hand and I feel it would be very helpful. 

Mission design - Again, keep in mind that I'm writing this in very early access, so I expect this to change at some point. Currently, the only missions are identification. Go in, find clues, deduce the ghost type, leave. I Don't have a problem with map design, but I would like to see other mission types, such as full on removal, as the game talks about you, the identification team, doing the research for a future removal team, missions like that would be great. Another is finding out how the person died and became a ghost, the journal mentions a few times about death and people becoming a ghost. Finding clues about the death of the ghost would be a very interesting mission design and I'd love to see it come to light.

Sanity is also something I expect to become something much more than it is currently as the game goes on. I feel that is obvious but I will give my 2 cents anyway for complete transparency. Right now, with my current understanding, it doesn't matter until you hit 50% at which point the ghost becomes more aggressive against you. This on it's own is interesting and can be useful for drawing the ghost out, but I would like to see more, such as hallucinations, both visual and auditory. There's not much more I can say on this, anything I could is just as obvious as that so I won't bother, and again, expect changes to this.

Lastly, when you die, you become a ghost and wander the map as an invisible entity. I think this has a lot planned for the future, but currently that's all there is to it. I think it would be extremely interesting if you could interact with the world in a similar way to the spirit your team is still hunting. Things like flicking the lights, writing short phrases on walls, or maybe being able to speak in a ghostly filter for just a couple seconds to give them a clue, would be very fun and make it so you're not just a passive and clueless observer if you are killed. If done in a way where it isn't always clear if the interaction is between the hostile spirit or your fallen friend, it would be possibly the most unique thing I've ever seen in a co-op horror game.

All in all, this game is a steal at it's current $15 price, and I got it on sale for less than $13! Even if you want to wait to play it when it's more developed, pick it up now! I have no issues recommending this to anyone, and I anticipate a very bright future in those dark corridors.

3,Phasmophobia,76565220,english,"Phasmophobia, is a 4 Player Co-Op psychological thriller Horror game where you are a Ghost Hunter trying to determine what type of ghost is haunting the area. Maps include (from what I have played) a Small 1 Floor Home, a 2 story home, a High School. a Farmhouse and an Asylum (the Early access states there are 7 maps currently but so far I've only encountered 5). 

The maps are very well done (More maps are planned for the future) and every ghost hunt is different from the last. Just did the Farmhouse and your ghost was a super Aggressive Demon that killed everyone? Next time you could have the most talkative, friendly ghost you ever encountered.

Speaking of Ghosts, holy cow...Phasmophobia Has NAILED the Psychological and ambience part of this game. The whispering that can happen in your ear, the Gasping and moans...I won't tell you everything ;) but man this game knows how to scare your pants off. There are many types of ghost including Jinn, Demon, Wraith, Spirit and many many more (with way more ghosts planned for the future) and each ghost type will react to you in different ways and can change game to game (some are more talkative than others, some react more aggressively to certain actions/phrases).

There are many (I believe 22? currently with way more planned in the future) Ghost Hunting Equipment you can purchase and use to help you hunt and figure out the different ghosts roaming.

Regarding the Gameplay itself, It is very much doable Solo but the real fun comes with playing with a group and working together. As it stands, VR has an advantage over Non-VR users as VR is allowed to carry 4 items whereas non-VR can only carry 3. VR users also have an easier time lighting Smudge Sticks (Though Devs have stated they will make it easier for Non-VR users in a future Update). 

Regarding bugs and other issues, Honestly, I haven't encountered any MAJOR gamebreaking bugs that has hindered our progress entirely BUT I have encountered some mechanics not working as intended such as Cameras placed in the Haunted Room do not always pick up Ghost Orbs (especially when one of the Evidence is Ghost Orbs) and the Spirit Box not always picking up the Ghost Voice (Again, Especially when one of the Evidence is Spirit Box) but despite this, it is very much possible to still figure out the type of ghost.

Regarding the Scares, There are no REAL jump scares in this game besides stuff being thrown at you, lights flickering, and the occasional times where the Ghost shows you its true form and rushes at you before disappearing or you know....when you are the chosen victim for its HUNT....then all I can say is....RUN, HIDE & KEEP SILENT! This game is 100% open mic so even when you are talking, the game still hears you and so does the Ghost...so unless you want to have a meet & greet with Destiny, its best you stay quiet until it tires of you.

TLDR: I HIGHLY recommend this game for people that love Horror games and just getting that chill down your back. It is extremely fun, great game to play with friends and the experience is constantly changing (no Scenario is usually ever the same.) Being just an Early Access game, this game is already an incredible experience, has already had 4 updates within a week release (Devs are all over their Discord trying to improve their game as much as possible) and I have high hopes for its Full Release! 8/10!",1601077614,1601078684,TRUE,1,0,0.521739125,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,263,5,656,656,193,1601345406,,

5,Phasmophobia,76565649,english,"This game is definitely a new type of experience. I would highly recommend playing it at least for the new experience. But the game is really glitched. Some of the problems that you can expect from the game are the Spirit Box glitches to where it doesn't here you; items will disappear in the floor;  you can randomly get kicked from a game and then every 5 seconds you get respawned at the home screen with a welcome message; when someone dies, their items glitch and disappear into the floor. When you try to join a session, you usually get kicked because there is no way for people to invite their friends to a private session so they always have to do a public session. I wish there was a better way to have private sessions where you can invite your friends and also a session description so you can describe whether or not you want people with mics only, if it's a friends only game, if there's a level expectancy for the game, etc. Also I wish there was a wiki or something for this game because I barely know how to win and I can't find any research on it.",1601078356,1601078356,TRUE,1,0,0.523809552,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,55,1,3175,2425,1363,1601786558,,

Overall if the devs need some ideas on how to fix things up, they should take a look at a map like The Devouring on VRChat, which is also in Unity and has had the VRC devs hack away at their controls for several years to the point where it's very polished, and the four devs who made the map have then used that platform for a co-op horror experience.

I don't normally have much any huge emotional reaction, especially with horror games as they've all since become the same thing. Linear, jumpscarey, predictable and mediocre.

The strongest part about this game and why it works so well is the total unpredictability and impossibility to control the situation. There's no force scripted events, there's no linearity, you just go in and try and find ghosts, and no matter how much pre-planning and discussion you have with your teammates to execute trying to find evidence, you'll never be able to know what will happen.

This game is a prime example of horror done absolutely right. The horror here is more tension and atmosphere based rather than jumpscares. Although they exist, because of the nature of simply what ghosts are, the horror here is the total feeling of unpredictability and the want to just leave the house and never return, but the need to overcome that and get more evidence.

I played for around three hours solo and was treated to some major fear sweats and heart pounding. This game is brutal.

I played with a friend thinking it would be easier and less scary...those thoughts were very wrong, now there were two grown men screaming and nearly crying.

The developers have either a history with paranormal investigation or have done some research on the subject, their gear selection is pretty accurate...aside from not needing a coin to keep the EMF detector on while not holding it...I'm hoping for more equipment to be added, such as laser grids to detect movement and DVRs for EVP work. I do wish there was more of an ""investigation"" aspect to it than just find room, get two or three clues and choose what spirit type it is, I'd just like a bit more depth to it. I would also like to have one or two more monitors in the trailer.

The locations are fantastic, lots of variety, the high school is the newest one I have unlocked and it is a place of nightmares... I would love to see more interactivity from the ghosts with the environments. Have the ghosts open cabinets, move items from room to room, change things and add to the fear and threat of each job.

There are a variety of different ghost types to contend with and they are described well, I would like to see more variety in terms of appearance for the ghosts. So far they seem to be either shadow people, character model copies, or full body apparitions, I'd like to have some translucent forms, as well as a fade in/fade out effect rather than them just appearing.

The sounds and ambiance are well done, very spooky. I feel like the game would benefit from more random sound effects or more so sound effects related to the individual ghosts for each job such as a ghost with a bat - have some knocking sounds of the wooden bat and such.

Each job has brief descriptions and they're fine for now, but I wish there was more variety and detail to them. How did the person die, giving clues to where the ghost might be and also tie into the look of the ghost itself. Or through investigation, have the players figure out the cause of death and such.

The graphics are fantastic, aside from the somewhat wonky player models (hopefully they'll get a bit better). At times there seems to be some visible seams in the buildings and environmental clipping. All in all really well done could be incredible with a bit of polish.

The controls are a bit weird to get used to on M&KB, but I assume that's due to the VR aspect? Hopefully they can be made better with more options for keybindings. Once you can get used to them, the controls are fine, but not great.

So far, I and my co-op investigator are having a terrifyingly good time with the game and we're very excited to see what is to come!

The game does a very good job on the horror/terror aspects, as the game isn't filled with cheap jumpscares. It's filled with ambience and nuances of sounds that's designed to bring true terror or dread for when you first enter the area. 

Focusing once more on the horror aspect, this game is moreso designed in a terror kind of way (which makes sense because you're a ghost investigator). There's a lot I'd like to list here, but I think it's a lot better to keep it as a surprise to get that kind of experience ingame. 

The only tip I have for new players is to definitely play the tutorial, and don't worry about going in alone because the ghost is always non-violent in the tutorial. 

Edit: I also forgot to include this in, but the map sizes for each area are insane. Some of the maps you'll have (when starting out) will most likely be streethouses and roadhouses. You'll be able to unlock bigger maps when you get enough xp to level up (you get experience from completing optional objectives and guessing what type of ghost you're dealing with correctly). 

TLDR: If you have a knack for spooky experiences, or you remember watching 'Ghost Adventures' as a kid, get this game. You won't regret it.",1600836630,1601058505,TRUE,0,0,0.462328792,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,64,3,1894,1894,1066,1601588475,,

Horror is just flat out disturbing imagery and events (take Resident Evil for example).  Terror, on the other hand, leaves most of the development of fear and anxiety up to the mind of the individual (Subnautica, despite not being a horror game itself, does this excellently as well).  Phasmophobia does this astoundingly well, and I can't give the game enough praise for how well the developer has executed the premise!

One thing to consider before buying, though.  ""Do I have a mic, and am I willing to use it to communicate with my teammates?""

Phasmophobia is one of the best horror games for VR I’ve ever played. Despite it still being an Early Access title the game is still packed with content. For $14 this game is a MUST have for any horror or VR enthusiast.

With the ghosts being random each time you start a level and so many other variables this game has the potential to be played over and over again for hours! Getting to hunt with your friends only enhances this experience as well. This game is the perfect combination of horror and strategy that allows you and your friends (or strangers) to work together to hunt down and identify ghosts. 

The game does have its quirks and glitches but the developers have been very invested in the community; listening to feedback, taking suggestions and working hard to fix bugs as soon as they appear which is something I greatly admire as this will allow the game to continue to grow.

I am an unbiased source who feels a large disgust toward anyone who uses ""content"" as a word to describe sitting infront of a screen and saying random nonsense to an audience comprised mostly of children.)

With that out of the way; this is the most enjoyable co-op horror game you will ever play. Death is meaningful, you lose the expensive equipment you bring. So even after you get used to the atomosphere the tension of losing what you earned remains. This inturn makes whatever you are facing always something to be feared.

Teamwork is essential and you *will* need a mic. I usually avoid games like that but this one looked so good and it didn't disappoint. You need a guy in the van to monitor things and multiple people to set up equipment. However, to test certain things (spirit box for example) you need someone on their own. Thats extremely risky as the longer you are in the dark by yourself the more your sanity decreases which inturn opens you to lethal attacks.

The only real negative in terms of mechanics I would put to this game is that there are two movement speeds; super slow-mo or extremely casual walk (or ""sprint"" as the game calls it). Thats just too slow. Even if I know every hiding place I basically have to be right next to one during an attack to stand any chance of using it. I get why the devs want to limit speed but this causes frustration which inturn breaks immersion. A happy balance between pacing and speed needs to be found.

It loses alot of what makes it scary after a while because of a few things one is the repetition of events and learning when the ghost hunts. If this game wants to build up the scare factor it should add new hunting effects and randomize it. Like maybe instead of the lights flicking make a whole bunch of objects start floating and drop when the hunting stops.  Or maybe make a stomping noise that gets closer and the lights don't flicker but you can hear the ghost walking loudly.  The ideas for this would make it not as much as how it is now with ""My flashlight is flashing we need to hide"" and more like something that could hunting it could be a ghost event and reward you for choosing right. Also, I don't know if it does this already but it saying you steam name on the ouija board and asking things like ""Who will you kill next"" would be great!

38,Phasmophobia,76535616,english,"The best and most memorable games I have played are those with emergent gameplay, and by that I mean gameplay which was not specifically programmed, but occurs because of the way the human player interacts with the game environment. And Phasmophobia has it in spades.

Definitely meant to be played in teams of 2 or more and best experienced in VR (although reportedly still great without VR). The core gameplay requires you to enter a haunted house, locate the room the ghost is haunting, then perform tests to gather three positives that allow you to identify the ghost. If you take too long or make the ghost angry, it will try to kill you, and you need to run and hide to survive.

The genius in this system is that to perform the tests, you have to do things which are psychologically repellent, such as locking yourself alone in the room with the ghost, turning off the lights and trying to provoke it. This leads to bravado followed by hilarious displays of cowardice from the teams of players, as people try to ""out-brave"" each other, then get the pants scared off of them by the ghosts. Half the time the player's own paranoia is the real cause of their fear, and every footstep or door slam from one of your teammates causes terror. But when the ghost wants to be scary it will leave you scrambling back to your mystery bus gibbering with your tail between your legs.

I'm really excited by the potential of this game, and it is already absolutely great fun, especially for the price. Every encounter I have had so far has been memorable and unique. If you don't have friends with the game it seems (My situation) it is easy enough to find a server or start your own and wait for someone to join you, and the community at the moment has a lot of great people who play in a cooperative spirit. Make sure you have a mic and speech recognition set up though - communication is half of what makes this game as great.",1601041367,1601041367,TRUE,1,0,0.523809552,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,175,3,896,896,513,1601558156,,

My biggest ""complaint"" is that you don't keep special equipment like a thermometer, crucifix, etc., after a mission that it's used on. So, you have to constantly buy new ones and may miss out on some of the optional objectives/evidence if you don't have them. But, we could also just be bad at the game. Total possibly.

I went into this game not expecting much because of the low price, I played with 4 other friends for 3 hours and am eager for next session.
This game really manages to capture a nail-biting atmosphere which can be hard in horror MP.

Pros:
Good ambience
Lots of gadgets
Good SFX
Great VOIP
Extremely Scary
Large Ghost variety, giving a lot of replayability
Great VR mode, outdoes normal kbm mode.

Cons:
Bad ghost animations
Not as much ghost to prop interaction as I would have wanted
Lack of jumpscares

My thoughts -
While this game manages to capture an incredibly scary ambience, it does not do well on jumpscares. My worst one to date was seeing a player teammate ghost copy that phased through me with a loud pitch. I was scared shitless.
I would love if there was more jumpscares scattered through ghost interaction. Another cool addition would be if ghosts would knock over more things such as vases, glasses, plates etc.
The animation when you get killed is super underwhelming and would love to see this get refined overtime.

The developer seems really active and has under my time of playing this game reworked voip sfx through radio and fixed multiple issues.
If this game keeps getting content and maintains this variety in gameplay, I will definately be putting this in my top horror game with friends list.",1601009964,1601009964,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,366,9,900,900,231,1601839143,,

It touches that Paranormal horror, Jump scare, Goosebump rending chills each time i go for a round. There hasn't been a moment where I haven't felt ""Safe"" outside the 5 minute set up period. Calling out the ghost's name and talking in game is immensely immersive. Solving the Dark Unknown of what kind of ghost it is while also fearing for your life at any given moment is such a thrill. Theres so much potential in this game that I've dumped countless hours into this each session without feeling bored once.

3,Phasmophobia,76511086,english,"Here is my review of Phasmophobia
I have been playing this game for 10 hours straight and continue to play even more.
I love horror games and have played hundreds, most of them use cheap jump scares or for the story driven ones usually fall a bit flat or seriously lack replayability aside from games such as dead by daylight and perhaps Left for Dead 2 (if that even counts tbh)

Not this game, this game has a very promising future ahead of it and I guarantee it will blow up in popularity when the polish starts to rub on which the Developer has been actively working on improvements for the game and constantly fixing bugs, adding content, adding features (such as recently adding the ability to easily invite friends with private lobbies)

[h1] The gameplay [/h1]
You are a paranormal investigator who has been called out to the job you have selected to find out what type of ghost you are dealing with. You need to use your equipment to locate and find Evidence as well as the ghost itself when you have 3 pieces of evidence you can leave and hand over your findings to a Ghost Removal team that will take care of the threat.
You Cannot fight the ghost, you have tools to help you avoid it and find it but remember YOU ARE NOT WELCOMED HERE
There are currently 12 [u] DIFFERENT [/u] types of ghosts all with different combinations of evidences to confirm what type it is.
This means you will have a different experience 90% of the time with only a repeating offender occasionally, some ghosts are much more violent or less common to be in a mission such as the Demon or Wraith which is one of the most horrifying experiences you can get.

[h2] Game Mechanics [/h2]
This game has special mechanics that honestly arent really seen in other games for example
-Your microphone will be on while you play the game, meaning the ghost is ALWAYS listening to you, speak the ghosts name and it will be angered and annoyed and start doing things such as cutting the power, throwing objects around, flicker the lights, bang a door, moan, turn on a TV or radio, and so much more.
-Your Breath revealing the rooms Temp, its a very subtle but extremely useful mechanic. When you're outside you'll notice you can actually see your own breath due to the cold. However some ghosts when they enter a room will cause the freezing temperatures and showing your breath (This is a piece of evidence linking to what kind of ghost you're dealing with!)
- The Hunt, its a phase during the course of the game in which the ghost will start to flicker the lights rapidly, possibly shut the power off (depending on type of ghost), and [b] LOCK ALL EXIT DOORS [/b] you are trapped in the house with the ghost and it is looking to kill you, you have only one primary option and that is to HIDE. You have only 5 seconds to break the line of sight of the ghost or hide in a closet or locker (similar to outlast!) The hunt can last anywhere from a few seconds to a few minutes and the genuine confusion and mayhem is terrifying. 
There's more but for the sake of length we will stop there.

Overall this game is very promising and just needs more polish and this will become an amazing title that all the boys can play together. I highly recommend playing it, the Dev is constantly updating the game and so far is very promising!

Each mission is randomly generated in a select house. This includes ghost type and objectives. When you first play, read the journal located on your right shoulder. Just read the whole thing. Once you understand the game, it’s still as scary but twice as fun. Also please do the training a couple of times to see evidence and learn some tricks.

Of course being an early access title, there are plenty of things to be improved upon and added to. Also true to most early access titles is the fact that a lot is usually already planned for the games development up to a 1.0 release. The team behind the game are very clearly listening, communicating, and improving alongside the community. Many have said it in their own reviews, but this game is amazing, and it can only get better from here on out.

There were a few things keeping players from fully enjoying every aspect of the game, but as of the first patch most of these issues have been taken care of, or addressed in some fashion. This is only update 1 out of many I am sure, and they knocked it out of the park!

I have no negative feedback to give on this title thus far. It's one hell of an early access title. I've hardly even noticed any of the bugs people have had, and i've never had anything game breaking. Very impressive.

64,Phasmophobia,76467036,english,"Phasmophobia is a horror survival mystery game, where up to four people can play ghost-hunters in a myriad houses around the US. The locations range in size and style. Whether it be a suburban house in a typical neighborhood, a farmhouse in the sticks, or one of the two larger locations, the High School or Asylum. You search for evidence around the premises (all interior spooks at the moment) ranging from moving objects and doors, to finger prints found with blacklight. Each house *cough* houses  one of a dozen different ghosts. Each one of these ghosts has their own unique spooks, and range in hostility. You and your team must gather clues before the ghost slowly picks you or your team off. If you mark down all three clues each mission requires, you can input your guess as to what breed of ghost you think it is, and head back to base and collect your pay, which relates to how you guessed, and the bonus side quests you achieved. You and your team can purchase a slew of unique gear with your savings, which can then be added to a community equipment locker, and taken on the job with you. Be careful not to get got though, because if you die, you lose the gear you brought in with you.

This game is scary, and the atmosphere and mechanics are really well implemented. Socially, each player set you are paired with will have their own style of playing. Like all rando pick-up games of this ilk, these play styles may or may not jive with your own. If you can find a team that share the same mentality, Phasmophobia can be extremely fun. If you find a teammate that doesn't care, yells in your ear, or can't count to ten...you may have a less than enjoyable experience. I prefer a gentle mix of RP, legit work, and balanced chatter. The ambiance is designed to lure you in subtly with creaks and faint whispers, or hit you with a slammed door and a heart throb. It's important to take in the milieu, and not constantly chat, especially about things not apparition related (my personal tastes).

I love what this dev team has done with the game. I highly advice you bury your ADD for a few minutes and play the tutorial--it will definitely be needed if you want to experience things how they are meant to be experienced. 

One really cool thing I love is how Phasmophobia has implemented voice recognition within the game. Talk to the ghost. Talk to the Ouija board. Ask it questions. Call out it's name and get it all riled up--just be ready to either run for the door, hide in a nearby closet, or freeze like a deer and pray the Demon, Wraith or one of the other malicious specters doesn't rip your head off. 

There is also a VR mode, although I have not tried it, it seems to be 10X scarier and slightly more cumbersome than playing with M&K. Although there are a few unique perks to VR. Like the ability to slowly place items in more advantageous positions, or carry two cameras on tripod at the same time. If the devs (or VR company) would kindly send me a VR unit (Index please) I'll gladly write another review. ;)

There are a few assets and production bits that can and probably will be improved. The character models and animations need a lot of work, and a few of the mechanics can get buggy. I would also like to see even more voice recognition implemented--it's a lot of fun, and can really encourage some fun RP and immersion. 

Phasmophobia is in early access, and after putting 10 hours in, I can confidently say that if you find a good team, you will have an absolute blast playing this game. And it's only $13! More than worth it. If you ever wanted to be a Ghostbuster, or a Ghost Hunter...you'll love this title.

This game is fantastic even in it's early state and definitely worth the price (12.59 or 13.99 when not at 10% off)

Pros:

While the game doesn't give you a super detailed tutorial, I feel that makes the game that much more enjoyable as you are struggling to figure out what haunts these locations. I haven't encountered any game breaking bugs in my 7 hours on record.

This game is a lot of fun while playing with friends or even randoms you may encounter while matchmaking. You can explore these locations by yourself but I have yet to do so.

Cons: 

I will tell you that the amateur missions seem to be harder than other difficulties due to fact that the ghosts seem too shy come out right away due to the missions being intended for smaller party sizes. This causes long games of trying to figure out where the ghost may be located as some of the ghosts only react when players are alone. This becomes an issue when your party size is larger than 2 on early missions.

The high school map is labeled medium however with the movement speed it feels way larger than it actually is. This wouldn't be an issue if character movement was enhanced past a slow crawling speed.

MOVEMENT SPEED. The ""Run"" in this game is more of a brisk walk, I would like for them to implement a faster ""Shift"" speed. Smaller maps seem fine with the option provided, however like stated with school map, it tends to cause issues. Forget going back to the truck after you're on the second floor.

Typically the match is everyone grabbing a thing and then trying to slowly creep through the house because everyone is a coward (especially me) and when we don't find any major evidence or see anything too crazy we assume the house isn't haunted. Then the lights turn out. Then we see shadows. Then all hell breaks loose as we spent seven minutes laughing and having fun and now the ghost is annoyed that we still exist. Oops, they killed Dave, welp sucks to be Dave we're outta there!

The game is honestly amazing so far and my friends and I have had a blast. There is plenty that needs tweaking, changing, expanding on, etc but the game is Early Access and I have more than enough faith in the dev team to keep the ball rolling. This game has been worked on for quite a while and is gaining popularity somewhat quick! Go into the Community Hub and look at the screenshots, they are hilarious as can be but know that wrapped up in all the laughter and joy this game brings there is a whole mess of scary craziness waiting to happen.

It's a bit rough around the edges, but still the game is amazing and I've been playing with friends nonstop. 
It succeds in creating a creepy atmosphere and delivers when the ghost appears, has voice activation so you can ask questions to the ghost, call it by the name and so on. 

Things to improve:
index controllers support 
more places to visit
more experience/money per mission
characters model and animation should be improved
more hints to the players when you have low sanity, complete an objective (some items seem they do nothing at all, for example: sound effect when you successfully repel a ghost with the crucifix would be great to know it's working as it should)

Possible future of the game: 
give the players a possibility of exorcising the ghost or capturing it
maybe possess players if the ghost is a demon, idk

10,Phasmophobia,76492777,english,"TL;DR: its a good game but needs some fixes and updates to make it Great. 7.5/10

This game is not your typical co-op horror game. It masterfully builds tension with great ambient noise and sound design.
You survive a haunted house with 4 friends or you can brave the ghosts by yourself, but personally with my at the time of writing this review 4 hours in the game recommend playing with friends. It keeps the tension up as you explore the dark rooms of these haunted structures knowing that anytime you can be picked off one by one these ghosts at anytime.

The one thing i absolutely adore is the lack of jump scares, i find jump scares cheap and not very exilerating and get boring extremely fast as they become almost too predictable. But having the ghost as an AI allows for always new experiences to keep the player base active and always asking for more. As one of the most terrifying moments for me in this game is where i was hiding in a closet asking the ghost where it was. It then said what i beleive is ""here"" as the closet door ripped open. Not many times in a game have i expereinced true horror on the scale like that. Phasmophobia is atmospheric horror and it does it very well. not allowing gamers to increase the brightness in game so they can see better in these unseen horors is great and id keep it that way. Though the flashlights should have increased radius are better lighting effect because even the strong flashlight seems only mildly better over the base one. 

The use of the mic in game to contact your demons, spirits and ghouls feels fresh and unique, and to see it in a unity build is almost jarring. The mic in game seems to work well, but i have experienced bugs in where you cant hear other players but they can hear you. So some work is needed to be done to flesh out the voice chat. Overall the mic in game is servicable.

Servers are a bit of an issue, during my short time with the game the U.S servers seem to be completely down, as they don't show up for me at all, so at the moment im currently stuck playing in EU servers. Not a big deal as it seems to have just fine connection and little lattency, but for other players this could be a major issue. 

Graphics are your typical unity projects, not the best looking games but its not going to overload your pc like crysis or modern AAA titles. Though where it truly shows that its unity is in the models and animations. Animations are ROUGH, even watching people that are playing in VR its very jerky and un natural. The models are stiffer than a bundle of 2x4s and the models you do see are ugly. id say a big improvement needs to be updated quite heavily on all the models and animations. 

By no means is this game bad, i recommend it. Its 15 dollars CDN at the time of writing this but i do think for the way the game is now the price should be lowered a little bit. Its not quite what id call a 15 dollar game, more like a 10 dollar game. But with updates to the main major issues in this game, adding more maps and ghosts. I can see this game taking off, and being put on many peoples wish lists. I would even say after some updates i would pay more for the game. But at this time and in the games state a 10 dollar game is the best i see it. 

Im looking forward to see where this game goes in the future and i hope the devs continue to update this game for the community.

12,Phasmophobia,76492467,english,"Even as someone who usually avoids VR horror games, Phasmophobia is quickly becoming one of my favorite VR games. Unlike many other horror games, it is not built around escaping, hiding from, or defeating some spooky monster. Phasmophobia's gameplay centers around investigation and information gathering instead. You can leave whenever, but the more you stay in the location and learn about the ghost, the better your payout will be. For me at least, this has been far more interesting than a lot of other horror games and also more replayable.
The VR implementation is a bit janky in places, doors in particular come to mind as frustrating, but the oddities are far outweighed by how fun it is to play. It even manages to stay suspenseful and scary while playing with friends, something a lot of other multiplayer horror games don't succeed at.

21,Phasmophobia,76487935,english,"It is a breath of (cold, terrifying) fresh air to see a horror game that breaks some molds and offers some unique experiences.  If you are familiar or a fan of the various paranormal investigative reality shows of present or past (Paranormal Lockdown, Ghost Hunters, etc.), the gameplay will be instantly familiar to you.  To those that aren't, the game gives an interesting look into the field of paranormal investigation with the scary twist of fictional psychological horror.

While still an alpha and in early access, Phasmophobia offers an interesting take on asymmetrical horror.  Either alone or in a group of up to 4 hunters, you are offered jobs in locations of various types and sizes.  From simple street houses, farm cabins and even an abandoned school and asylum, you are tasked with entering the location, finding the ghostly entity, and collecting enough evidence to successfully identify it.  As of this writing, there are currently 10 ghosts and about 6 unique locations (with more on the way).  Each ghost has different behaviors and detection requirements, and can originate in any of the locations rooms at random.  Numerous events can occur that help finding the ghost and ratcheting up the tension.  Normal jobs give you five minutes to get in and locate the entity.  When the time is up, players sanity will begin to rapidly drop while inside and the ghost will become more active and aggressive.  Unlike the reality TV counterparts, the ghosts in Phasmophobia are as capable of killing you as they are scaring you.

Whether solo or with randoms or friends, the fear factor remains high with creepy atmosphere, sounds and creeping dread.  Phasmophobia never relies on jumpscares to invoke terror and, in fact, has virtually none throughout the game.  There are plenty of tools at your disposal to help you as well as ones you can purchase with money you earn from completing jobs, daily tasks and optional objectives.  Gear includes many staples of paranormal investigation ranging from standard flashlights, UV lights, EMF detectors, still cameras and video cameras that can pipe a real-time stream of footage to your van/command center, and the like.  Many of the tools are grounded in real life and utilized by actual paranormal hunting teams, though a bit of fictional flair is added for the sake of the game and both enhancing their usefulness and enhancing the tension.

As said before, as of this writing, the game is still an alpha and in early access.  There are places where it's rough around the edges and some bugs do exist, but rarely do they prove detrimental to the available gameplay or lessen the experience.  In my personal opinion, the jankiness of the character models and animations (especially in VR) is actually kind of endearing, though I suspect much of it will be smoothed out over time.  More ghosts and locations, updated and added game modes and more are in the works and on their way from what is proving to be a very proactive developer.  The community is rapidly growing and the potential of this game is beyond impressive.  So if you are looking for some terrifying gameplay that doesn't rely on cheap scares that you can play with friends and laugh together about possibly requiring a change of underpants following an investigation, then this is the game for you.

I and many others are eager to see this game grow and improve, and hats off to the developer and everyone on his team for this budding experience.",1600965569,1600965569,TRUE,1,0,0.523809552,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,118,2,636,505,211,1601014971,,

The ghosts function very well. They will stalk you, try to split your group apart, and do everything they can to absolutely scare the actual crap out of you.

This game is [b]FUN.[/b] It has an insane amount of potential. I'm a big fan of Ghost Adventures, and ghost hunting in general and I love getting the chance to role-play as Zak Bagans and making the easily scared people of my group go do isolation. I'm a sucker for this type of stuff I've been waiting a long time for a game like this and my first impression is way beyond what I expected from a simple unity game. 

This game, hopefully, will go far. I'm already incredibly impressed with it. I do hope that the devs add in more areas, or give a community workshop with people making their own maps to explore and hunt on, but I cannot express properly how much fun I've had with this in the short time I've played it.

- Minimal jumpscares, and even then the jumpscares are used sparingly and are integrated amazingly into the gameplay.
- There is depth of play. Easy enough to understand the mechanics and gameplay but there is a steep learning curve.
- The ambiance, the maps, and the visuals all work into making your brain go wild. What I really appreciated about the game is that there are little to no outright ""scary"" imagery. It only uses small things to make you break into cold sweat such as the creaking on the floor, doors being slightly open, the lights flickering occasionally.
- Even if you play it over and over again, the fear factor never disappears. We've gotten to the point where we think we're already desensitized, but the game still manages to drop my sanity (heh) whenever the EMF reader goes off (even if it's exactly what we wanted to happen).

95,Phasmophobia,76465691,english,"This is without a doubt one of the few horror games that I truly love.
It's a co-op ghost hunting game where you use different gadgets to identify and deter the ghost.
There's many ghost types and each have their own ""personality"" like they only do paranormal stuff when someone is alone or the person is in complete darkness for example.
You can play this without Vr, but Vr provides absolute terror.

I got into a group of randoms and we literally spent 20 minutes setting up cameras and salt ""traps"" and discussing what kind of ghost we're up against. It's not only the scares it's the immersion that goes in so well.
Barely any jumpscares, the true fear is being in the area knowing the ghost could be stalking you in the room itself.

Oh did I mention it has voice recognition? The ghost reacts to questions and it also can get annoyed when you repeat their name multiple times.

97,Phasmophobia,76445133,english,"A streamer introduced me to this game on his stream and it looked really fun, so I decided to buy it and give it a shot!

The game is very fun and creepy overall, especially if you're by yourself, but the real fun of this game is playing with random players. You never know who you'll get, which gives excitement to the game. While the game play itself gets repetitive (I actually found myself bored playing single player after hours of multiplayer), playing online was always a blast no matter what.

The groups I ran into could be very serious, super casual, hilarious, or even extremely scared. I remember a group of people where our tactic was to insult the ghost to get it to react and she got mad and attacked a guy and we just hear him screaming upstairs and die. There was a kid on cameras who was too scared to be in the house and we could hear him yelling from the van, ""I saw it! I saw it! It killed him!""

We tried to get more clues only for a short time after because we didn't want to make the other guy wait too long while dead; the one disappointing thing about this game.

While the game is fun while you're alive, it really sucks when you die. You can't do ANYTHING but walk around, listening to repetitive ghost music that starts getting really annoying. You can't even hear what your teammates are saying. My one recommendation for this game is they really need to revamp the ghost aspect. Maybe allow you to hear your team, write a message on the mirror, maybe even flicker a light or two to mess with your teammates. Anything, honestly. Being dead just makes you want to leave the game instead of wait it out for your team.

To summarize, this is a very fun and interactive game with a detective vibe due to figuring out what you're against, has a creepy atmosphere that can make you uncomfortable and on edge (which a horror game should do), and a lot of fun things you can do, especially online. The one drawback to this game is when you die, its extremely boring waiting for your team to finish the investigation. Because of this, I will investigate for only a couple more minutes (usually less than 5 minutes) I always ask my teams if we want to wrap up the investigation early, so that way the dead teammate doesn't have to be extremely bored and listen to annoying wispy music.

I 100% recommend this game because there is only ONE drawback to an overall extremely fun game! Can't wait to see how many more interaction they make with the spirit box, more maps, more items, more ghost types, and more words and statements the ghost can understand to anger it.

10,Phasmophobia,76442016,english,"This game is in early access at the moment of writing this review, but this has by far been one of the most interactive games I've played for VR in quite some time. It has a lot of scenarios that make every ghost unique. Oh yeah every ghost is unique by the way. There are 10 different types of ghost you have to identify and even with almost 5 hours in the game I have many I haven't encountered yet. I see a lot of potential for this game taking a simple concept of ghost hunting and making it a real nightmare to come true. 

Things to keep in mind about this game
-Solo is fun for being scared but it extremely difficult to accomplish many things because this game is focused on teamwork
-Leveling up in this game is really hard, so getting new gadgets for you and your team will take a lot of time (5 hours into the game and I just got level 2) its quite a grind but a fun one.
-A fantastic game for friends who own VR

Other than that there are some rough things around the edge like item interaction sometimes is whack and you have to drop items to swap them into another hand and can be hard to navigate when dealing with an encounter. Some bugs with audio but mostly minor things and nothing game breaking, it is mostly stuff that will improve over time in development I'm sure.

I play on desktop and it's creepy as hell. People on VR I've played with lose their shit at times. I can't even imagine.

There's a fixed amount of sites but between the different types of ghosts and ways you can collect evidence on them it doesn't get stale so far. There's light progression that helps as well.

Ghosts range from shy troublemakers to murderous demons that will slam the doors, lock you or your unfortunate buddy in, and kill you. 

It's pretty nuts to be investigating a room, have the lights flicker prompting people to leave the room and before the last person gets out it shuts and locks. When it opens again your buddy is dead.

Cons: The animations are a little strange, but it's basically a non-issue.

This game scared me like when I was a teenager playing the Clock Tower game. I went into the farmhouse and pulled out my spirit box and started asking questions. I determined the ghost was creeping around dining room/living room since it answered me on the spirit box. Then it hit a key on the piano. I setup a video camera in the corner facing the piano. Then the phone that was off the hook started to ring. I pulled out my emf meter out and it maxed out. My heart really started beating at that point. Then, I heard the kitchen door open behind me. I turned around and pointed my flashlight towards the door. Didn't see anything. I walked through the door and started scanning the room with my flashlight. In the far corner of the kitchen I saw a dark figured ghost carrying an axe and it started walking towards me. I screamed out loud ""O hell no!""

No cheap jumpscares, just real unsettling and terrifying events.

All I can suggest for the devs is to branch out with the models for the ""ghosts"". A lot of them are sort of generic, and once you see their details they tend to stop being scary. One of the models bugged during my game, the child one, and it stretched the neck out way longer and made the face small and featureless. That gave me a REAL scare, and when compared to the actual model I wanted that grossly disfigured one because it was so much scarier.

Starting items not enough for 3 players to effectively go off alone, needed money to get equipment.

I figured the ghost can only kill one player at a time and once per 'stalking' event, so I devised a plan that we three go to the biggest and most open room of the house, stack up on each other in the corner and start screaming the ghosts name till he comes out, footsteps begin, it gets closer, we see it and start screaming staying in place getting as much photos as I can.

He grabs my friend and starts killing him, me and the other immediately book it out the house and drove off.

71,Phasmophobia,76362856,english,"Before I begin, I played using a VR Headset so experience with keyboard and mouse could be totally different. 

     I first found out about this game through youtubers and it caught my attention. After watching many videos I decided to buy it. When first going into the game, it makes you go through a ghost hunting tutorial where you'll be taught the basics of the game, like what an EMF detector does or how to identify the type of ghost that is haunting the location you are in. After passing the tutorial, you can now access multiplayer where you will be put with up to 4 people to ghost hunt different locations. 

     My first mission wasn't something to write home about as I was in a group of four, the players were friendly and basically made the atmosphere of the game light and jolly regardless of any ghosts in the room. We all stuck together and ended up completing the night with most objectives done (You are assigned 4 tasks to do before you are able to complete the night). It wasn't until the second job where the game truly shined. 
     
    After one of my teammates left, it was just down to three of us. No big deal as it was still fun. The location we next visited was a farm house, where the darkness reigned even with flashlights you could barely see. Our tasks were simple, take a picture of the entity haunting the location, capture its movements with a motion detector, and two others which I had forgotten about. This game utilizes speech recognition which players can use to interact with the ghosts, like saying phrases like ""Are you here?""  ""Show yourself"" or even the entities name which you'll be shown on the job description. For this particular job, the entity would get angry if you say his name, so to capture a picture of him, we had to force him to show himself. 

     Now being new to the game, I had no idea what the ghosts would be like, the job I did before with the group I barely even saw a shadow of one. So when this entity appeared in front of us I was actually scared, it made noises similar to that of the Grudge and it looked like an overcooked bacon strip, which doesn't sound scary but it was terrifying at the time. After aggravating it, it choked and killed one of my teammates but we had captured a picture of it, completing a task so my remaining teammate and I ran out of the house and back into the van where we discovered I did not place the motion detector down to capture the movement of the entity. 

     Now the game does have a health percentage -isk meter in the form of sanity percentage. As you can guess the more ghost encounters you have, you lower your sanity becomes and when it hits 0 I presume you die (Haven't hit 0 as of yet). This is relevant to my story as we discovered we hadn't done enough tasks and my teammate had only 6% of his sanity left where I had 65%. It was up to me to go back into the farm house, place the motion detector and aggravate the entity to make him walk past the motion detector. This was not an easy task, in fact it was down right terrifying. With the flashlight beam weak and the house creaking, the atmosphere was really set. My heart my thumping and my legs were shaking, I returned to the corner where my teammate had died and placed the motion detector down. As I looked around the dark room, my fear kept rising as footsteps sounded throughout the house, and rose more when I yelled his name and all the lights in the house flickered and the sound he made could be heard in the darkness. I ran yelling like a madman as the front door shut blocking my escape. Luckily I was on vr and I passed through the door like I was a specter myself. In the end, I ended up disconnecting due to bad connection but it still was fun, 

     Of course like I mentioned before, your experience could be completely different if you don't game on VR. The fear factor was probably increase just because of that one reason. The game's atmosphere, when alone, does get to you and even though its a game the mind starts to create illusions regardless. This game is simple, all in all. No specific story (To my knowledge) and limited content (At the moment) but regardless of these factors, the game excels on what it intends to do. Make you scared sh*tless. 

     I recommend you buy this game if you are love horror, or a fan a shows like Ghost Hunters, or Ghost Adventures or If you just want a good scare.",1600748219,1600748219,TRUE,3,0,0.523809552,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,60,2,476,428,47,1601442640,,

[b] [Thoughts and First Impressions] [/b]

Man, this game really threw me for a loop. On the one hand you have a well crafted 4 player co-op experience designed to just scare and unnerve the bejesus out of people and BOY does it work. On the other hand you have some negative elements such as the EXP curve, poor tutorial or explaining of game mechanics and often confusing encounters. Spoilers: None of the negative aspects of this game take away from the EXTRAORDINARILY fun gameplay loop and terror factors. 

This game is SO much fun. If you allow yourself to get into it and really try to hunt down the ghosts and take it seriously and work with your team... it's just one of the most fun experiences I've had in such a long time. Everyone has a tool and a job and you all have to stay in communication and work together in order to win at any particular level. Death is going to happen and it's tough to get around it, and even that's okay. It's just a terrifying experience from start to finish. Someone is going to have to walk into those pitch black rooms by themselves and try to communicate with the ghost over the radio. Someone is going to need to go to the basement in the pitch black and restart the fuse box. It's terrifying. It's fun. 

Find 3 friends that love to be scared and like a challenge. Get this game and go have a BLAST. You can see even as much as we were scared through the entire video the game was just a delight. We continue to play it a few days after purchase every night. 

It's SO scary. SO fun.

- Only 4 players (huge maps like Asylum makes it hard to find where the ghost is, big maps should allow more than 4 people)
- Sprinting (the sprinting is so B A D)
- Ghost voice that comes through the spirit box (in my opinion it should sound scary, but it's just regular voice)
- The algorithm to determine the ghost type is not great (there were times where we were certain about a type and we got it wrong even with all 3 evidences found)
- Losses all your items if your game crash or if the game bugs
- Sometimes the game will crash or bug (people get teleported back into the truck and screen keeps flashing for a while, really bad for people with epilepsy).
- Sometimes when joining a match you can't hear your peers microphones, so we need to restart the match (which leads to losing all your items, because if you leave an ongoing match then you ""fail"" the mission).

A note to the devs:
- Please fix the sprint! That sprint is too slow! Maybe add a breath bar that runs out if you keep sprinting for too long.
- Allow more than 4 players for medium to large sized maps!
- Fix the issue where you lose items when you crash or your game bugs.
- Enhance the algorithm to determine the ghost type, sometimes it's imprecise!",1600745570,1600745570,TRUE,1,0,0.483870983,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,41,3,2392,1324,997,1602037089,,

Also the dev account is very active in the discussion board where he/she is answering a lot of player questions. It's very helpful for some of the more ambiguous aspects of this game.

There is also a degree of risk management in this game. You can contribute to the team gear on a mission, but if you die, you lose everything you contributed. So... don't die, or know when to cut your losses and bail on the mission. 

Also, HAVE A MICROPHONE. Two reasons: 1) there is no typing chat in this game. You technically don't need to coordinate, but you might need something someone is holding or want someone to help you with something. 2) if you don't have a microphone, you cannot talk with the ghost. Without it, you cannot verify one of the potential pieces of evidence and you'll need another player to do it, which they may be unable to.

0,Phasmophobia,76350338,english,"I dont have PC VR. That being said I play mouse and keyboard. This game is a BLAST, I'm a huge horror fan both movies and games. That being said this game is terrifying. If games like Layers Of Fear, Outlast, Dead By Daylight etc is too scary for you than this game will not be for you. The best part about this game is the 4 player co op. You basically just try to hunt ghosts & collect the evidence to identify which type of ghost you're up against.

I know this game is early access BUT my one complaint is the training. The training tells you what to do but not how to do it. More so learn as you go. I played with 3 friends and we left the first several games as we didnt know how to leave after one or 2 people in our crew died. Go back to the van and shut the door. You want to collect as much evidence as possible without dying. When you die you dont get paid. The more evidence you collect the more you get paid which opens it up to buying more tools for your next hunt. When you die you also lose the extra tools you bought.

The graphics are really nice (compared to most horror games around same price), when it's dark it is dark, the built in voice parameter is a very nice touch to this game (I suggest leaving your discord chat and indulging in in game). Lights dont always work so if you go in without a flashlight you better hold on to a friend... extremely excited to see where the developers take the game upon release.

Now what does that mean? Each run you start in your truck, gather equipment and set it up in the area and, well, investigate on which type of ghost you are dealing with here. You also get random objectives like capture a picture of a paranormal activity, witness a paranormaal activity, gather DNA evidence, ... well you get the idea. After each run you get money and experience with which you unlock more stuff. 
Oh and did I meantion that you can actually talk to the ghost and it will give appropriate answers? We were in this room where we believed the ghost had its origin from and asked ""Are you here?"", the imidiate answer we got was ""Here."". Next question was ""Can you give us a sign then?"", answer: ""Yes."", next thing that happened was a little bit much but I can summerize it: Two of us started screaming, the ghost appeared in front of us and was starring and groaning at us, the light started to flicker and the last guy went back outside, yelling at us ""Screw this shit, I am out!"".

Its simple yet VERY atmospheric. I recommend it for everyone that doesnt like jumpscares but still enjoys a good horror experience.

The developer(s?) seems reachable via Discord and the amount of customization and randomization gives a great amount of re-playability without feeling like you're doing the same thing over and over. That said I suck at identifying the ghost.

If you don't have a group to play you can still find groups, although be prepared to get kicked from a lot of lobbies waiting on friends, even though they can set them private.

This game is the perfect example of a good early access game, and it is exactly the sort of thing that other EA titles should aspire to be. 

Somehow - and much to my excitement - Phasmophobia  manages to remain as a scary horror experience despite the cooperative function. I think it's because when your friends are no longer around you, the spirits will only be coming for you. What's more is that the ghosts can hear you, so are you ever truly alone? 

Phasmophobia in its early access state provides you with varied locations and equipment, as well as ten types of paranormal beings to hunt.  This content comes at you at a steady pace through the use of their progression system, which ensures new content for hours to come. All of this adds up to varied investigations every time you play it, with more content surely to be added by the developer in the future. 

There is plenty of room for polish, but I highly recommend this game because of the solid, functional features already found inside the game.

28,Phasmophobia,76319623,english,"Phasmophobia is still in early access, and a very early build at that, so things are subject to change as the game gets updated especially with how frequently they seem to be updating it. With that out of the way, the game at the time of this review already has plenty of elements in place that make it a great horror game. There are a variety of paranormal entities (about 10-12 or so?) that make every run a unique experience. This game can be enjoyed singleplayer, but the true amazement lies in the multiplayer aspect. Most horror games because exponentially less scary once you play with friends, which is what a lot of multiplayer horror games suffer from. However, Phasmophobia doesn't suffer from this issue as much. Even if you have a full group of 4 (Like I usually do), the game continues to feel scary by putting everyone on high alert, so you're constantly trying to operate as a cohesive unit while you're hunted by an invisible entity. It's also terrifying when you watch your friends get murdered one by one and you become the last one alive. Some ghosts require players to be alone to draw them out, so it's usually a big argument as to who is going to sit in the living room all by themselves while the rest watch on the night vision cameras. When this game isn't scary, it's definitely hilarious.

Despite the game being in essentially Alpha/Pre-Alpha, there are surprisingly few game-breaking bugs that make the experience unenjoyable. One large bug my group and I found was that a lot of the time our 4th person wouldn't load in and either get kicked to the main menu for no apparent reason or just crash their game. The in-game voice chat also had several issues where only certain people could hear each other. It also wasn't consistent in how this worked. Sometimes 1 person could hear the other 3 and they couldn't hear them, or 2 people could hear 1 person while 1 couldn't hear anyone, or any kind of combination you could imagine. At a point it game increasingly more frustrating so we decided to use Discord for all of our talking. The in-game voice recognition didn't seem to have many problems, and actually was quite accurate for picking up spoken words and phrases.

Overall, based on the current status, I'm going to give this game a 7/10. This game has some great features to it, and manages to feel scary even when in a group, especially on some of the larger and freaky maps (no spoilers however.) I highly recommend running through the training so you understand the different methods of figuring out which ghost you're dealing with. My group didn't do that and we struggled with our first 4 or so ghost hunts. There are some bugs that make the game hard to enjoy, but there are third party solutions to them (if you're not playing with randos of course) and overall they don't break the core of this game, which is ghost busting.

TL;DR Good game with solid mechanics, with few bugs that don't break the core element of horror this game portrays. I could definitely see this becoming something much greater than it is already.

[b][u]Why I Picked It Up[/u][/b]
I don't play 'horror' genre games. But I lent my Oculus Rift to my friend recently so I could have someone to play games with in VR. We started browsing new trending VR games and we noticed Phasmophobia, watched the trailer and he got soo excited he bought it right away. I decided to join.

[i]Note: You need to complete 'training' before being able to play with friends. So I went into 'training' and quit to put my graphics up and it completed training when I came back, so I went in with [b]NO EXPIERENCE[/b][/i]

[b][u]What It Felt Like[/u][/b]
Knowing from the trailer it seemed to be of a 'ghost hunting' theme and it's spot on. You really feel like you are a ghost hunter. With all the items you have [you can buy A LOT more, but I sucked ass for the 2 hours I did play it and only made 20$] it makes everything very interesting. We split the 'tools' among our 2 man team and went in doing our best to learn it as we played normal. Lets just say I loved it that much for the non-horror fan I was. I ended up shaking in my boots wanting more.[url=https://www.twitch.tv/videos/747567964]A Highlight Of That For Anyone Interested[/url]

- Beautiful as hell and runs on my 1660 super while streaming.
- No visual breaks of immersion [besides your own vr hands]
- Quick loading times
- Impressive voice local communication
- A nice amount of 'tools' / 'gadgets' you can use
- You can yell at ghosts and they hear you

- VR characters tend to do the Michael Jackson lean 80% of the time after moving.
- [strike]You can yell at ghosts and they hear you[/strike]
- Hard to open doors the way you want. At least with index.

- There is no finger tracking / hand animations [at least at the time of this review]
- [strike]You can yell at ghosts and they hear you[/strike]
- Can't get 'teleport grab' to work properly on index.
- No hit sounds. AKA if you pick up a hammer and smack a metal, it don't go 'ting'

33,Phasmophobia,76317692,english,"In the 10 or so hours that I have played this game, Phasmophobia has been a really fun play with my other 3 friends. 
Phasmophobia is a game about paranormal investigations, where you search a building to find evidence of paranormal activity. The game delivers this concept very well, while being simple and easy to understand when you are first starting out. The game is equally creepy and fun to play, even while I was speedrunning. 
The replayability of this game is also pretty good, with a levelling system and coins system so you can buy equipment to capture evidence for ghost activity. Although you can get a fair amount of experience while completing objectives, it can be tedious to level up if you don’t really know what to do.
The graphics are also pretty decent, but if you are playing in VR, then I don’t really think it would matter, unlike the audio which gives the atmosphere a bit of spook.
The only thing I would have to complain about is the bugs. There aren’t too many bugs but when there are it could be a bit annoying to play at times. Especially in VR, if you are backed up into a wall it would bug out and teleport you to someplace else.
Overall this game is very well made for a solo developer, I can’t wait to see what he has to bring in the later updates. It’s a yes from me!

You can view my review & gameplay here: https://youtu.be/S7rSgub_1bw

If you ever wanted to be a paranormal investigator like on Ghost Hunters or Paranormal State, but for real instead of those grifters, then this is the game for you. Even though it is in Early Access and buggy at the moment, there's enough here to make for a very memorable and spooky experience. 

This game is definitely geared for online coop play, however, you can play solo. You'll have take on different jobs where you go to different sites and investigate several different paranormal entities. You'll have tools like an EMF meter, or UV lights, or spirit boxes. 

There's a surprising amount of depth to this game as you try to uncover the mysteries of each job. You'll also have some side tasks to accomplish for extra money and experience, such as taking a photo of the paranormal entity or get the freezing temperature checked. The locations can be pretty dark, but this game does a nice job with the use of light and shadows and strange sounds all around. There's not a lot of jump scares, instead this game relies on the slow building of tension. Of course, if you're not careful, it could be the death of you.

The game is running on the Unity Engine. I was usually getting a steady 90 frames per second on my 1060 GTX. There is full locomotion plus smooth turning available, along with teleportation. Unfortunately, the locomotion was a bit too slow for my taste. I also experienced an issue where my teleportation stopped working. Also, my turning would intermittently stop working as well.

I also experienced several connection issues. Even when I did connect to an online group, I would get kicked out of the group most of the time almost immediately upon joining. The good news is that there are a lot of people online for this game, although many are Non-VR. I also experienced several freezes at the loading screens where I would have to manually quit the game to get it work properly again.

Despite all the issues I experienced, I still recommend this game. It was a blast to play when it worked properly. This is already one of the better VR horror experiences and might even be the definitive horror experience in VR once all the bugs are smoothed out and the gameplay is polished up. This is a must buy for any VR horror fan. 

[b]Rate 7/10. Buggy game, but it is in Early Access. I had fun & it got me scared. I already feel like I got my money's worth. [/b]

I do have to give props to a few things I've experienced while playing. The game, visually, looks amazing. I was sucked into it right away because of the visual aspect of the game and the sound. The use of the tools the player were equipped with made the game feel realistic. Unfortunately the bad out weighed the good for me.

The game was so boring and confusing. I understand there has to be a learning curve, but the game didn't give me enough to [i]want[/i] to invest any more time into it. The controls were confusing right away jumping into the game. The door was locked and after a while i discovered where the key was to unlock it, but I couldn't pick it up. I can only hold so many things at once, but nothing told me that, so i thought the key wasn't meant to be picked up. Later on i finally discovered the controls on the TV, which was fine, but could of been presented to me earlier before wasting all of my time discovering it. I enjoy fumbling through a game, but only if I'm [i]playing[/i] the game. In this case I feel like it was a waste of time. 

The noise and certain items randomly moving was awesome, but i expected more. I took my time searching the house before I got to the kitchen and was disappointed nothing jumped out at me or more went on. The scene was spooky, but that's all. Same with the ending. It was very... anti-climatic.

I wanted to like this game, but just couldn't to bring myself to invest more time into it with little reward.

Super fun experience with my 3 pals playing the game for the first time.

Things I'd like to see fixed / added to the game:

1. Valve Knuckles controllers have weird inconsistencies when your thumb touches the sensor pad, ""track button"". It's like a watered down locomotion option that does a quarter of what the joysticks do.
You'll accidentally rest your thumbs on the pad, then rotate in a slow, choppy manner or strafe in a random direction.

2. The video camera has absolutely no video display on the physical camera itself!
At the beginning of my experience, with 1 flashlight, 1 very dim UV light, and 3 other people, I was sad to see that you couldn't explore the dark environments with the night vision on the video camera.

Please add a display for the video camera on the camera itself. This would boost immersion, considering almost all cameras have their own built-in displays.

3. Honestly, any additional shadow forms for the ghost to compliment the creepy atmosphere. Sure the ghost you're hunting is terrifying as is, but ghosts are believed to have multiple forms depending on their ""charge"". That's why ghost hunters feed them electronics to help communicate.

Instead of seeing the ghost the one time where it's a solid form, having them appear around you as a disfigured shadow person would be absolutely chilling.",1600631642,1600631901,TRUE,2,0,0.521739125,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,135,4,1658,939,150,1601882428,,

It was genuinely terrifying and unsettling so I stayed in the truck to watch everyone else's sanity levels and EMF scales... and my group and I are still in amateur jobs currently, which makes me excited for what's to face next. 

With that being said, this game is extremely enjoyable and has barely any bugs, even in it's early access stage, which is very refreshing. It's a perfect mix of horror and humour (when played with friends). I'm not sure how single-player is because it's too scary for me to go at it alone, but it is available if you choose to do that. The game encompasses a very intriguing variety of supernatural entities, some being from different cultures on other sides of the planet. (I won't say ghosts because some are demons) There are also plenty of houses/maps to investigate, and you can play with 3 other people at once. 

The ""ghosts"" also seem to have different personalities, we met another Oni that we actually made fun of because he looked like a decrepit old man and all he did was show himself to us multiple times and not do anything, he seemed to be a bit shy. The other Oni I mentioned was hell-bent on killing most of my party and even wrote ""Die"" multiple times in our ghost-writing notebook we placed for him.

my experience with the game so far is quite positive, but i do have a few things i would like to be considered/changed or looked into to maybe make a better experience:
I do wish there was a way to play with more than 4 people. there is a very large white house in this game that i felt 4 people were not enough to properly cover. Also to add, i am not sure if certain ""ghosts"" cant be picked up on the detector, but there has been a few instances where a ghost is about to attack or is in my room and the detector does not signal anything. 

i wish players could get some XP even if they lose a round especially if they were in the house for a long time and were actually involved in the investigation as well as hoping that we wouldn't lose our items just for losing a round, especially when someone makes it out alive and leaves the zone.

for the price of this game though i especially am getting more than my moneys worth.

16,Phasmophobia,76253040,english,"And I thought Walking Dead Saints & Sinners was scary... Honestly though, this game is my favorite out of any of my VR games or even non VR games that I have played. The up to 4 player coop provides a unique experience that no other horror game has to offer and it does it well. The game is quite confusing when you first start off even if you do the training but that is what I love so much about it, you have to actually play to get good and understand what type of ghosts you are dealing with. Not to mention, with so much randomness and variety between ghosts and how unpredictable they are you will never be left disappointed when going to hunt for some ghosts. This game truly captures what horror is all about and that is the immersion, unpredictability, suspense, and overall non repetitiveness. 

The game does have jumpscares which any horror game should but what really makes this game stand out is that they are to a minimum and it can come out of anywhere which is guaranteed to scare even the toughest of people. The game does have its bugs but none of them that I have experienced myself are that game breaking, in VR you can phase and noclip a little bit through things such as doors and stuff if your at the right angle but honestly most of the time you will only do that if you do it intentionally. With the randomness also comes that great amount of suspense as you never know what that ghost is going to decide to do, one second your flashlights are working all fine and everyone is just searching, the next your lights are flickering the flashlights are turning on and off and you see a ghost at the bottom of the stares for a split second then the next it is gone and is right next to you killing your teammate. Or, even when everyone is just about to leave the house to check something in the truck and as the last person is coming out that door shuts right in their face and locks then the ghost pops out of nowhere and jumpscares the living hell out of you and has everyone freaking out. Even the moments where you are expecting something to happen still tend to scare the living mess out of you and keep you on your toes.

Also, don't forget that this game was mostly coded by just a single person and the amount of potential it has to be one of the greatest VR games ever is unlimited. With so much variety and how much the devs truly care about the game you are guaranteed to have a good experience. Plus, the models for the ghosts are extremely terrifying and will have you so shooken up the second you even catch a glimpse of it in the corner of your eye. The dev that made this game knows what true horror games should have and how they should be done and it honestly shows. It doesn't fail in any aspect of horror, it always keeps you immersed and wanting more when you are not playing it. This game is honestly so scary I slept with the lights on and so did a few of my friends.

Don't even forget about the variety in maps also, with maps like asylum and highschool you are guaranteed to be shaken when seeing or even being in those maps, and that isn't even including what is planned to come in the near future such as a mansion, apartment, and even a prison map. The dev is extremely open to suggestions and does his hardest to fix any bugs that pop up in the game. I have had the most fun I have ever had when playing a VR game and the replayability on this game is INSANE. To sum up this review, the game captures everything horror should have perfectly. 

Immersion - Check
Suspense - Check
Unpredictability - Check
Will always keep you on your toes and being terrified every second of the ghost hunt - Check

41,Phasmophobia,76235322,english,"So far, while I only have almost 6 hours in the game, that is definitely enough to give a review. First thing is first: up front, I am not on VR, as I don't have a VR headset. Yet. This game strikes me as one that would be phenominal in VR, however, and if I ever get a headset, this game is at the top of my ""to get in VR"" list.

This review will be focused on the standard version, so those without VR headsets, I'll talk about how it feels/controls.

First, let's rate the concept. I give the concept (or overall idea of the game) an 8/10. The idea of being a ghost hunter trying to make some money, but ACTUALLY risking their lives is a really good idea. This is one of those ideas with so much potential, and for now I can safely say Phantasmophobia meets the potential!

Controls (PC Only): Solid 7/10. The controls on PC don't feel super clunky like some games that have both a VR and a standard mode. The non VR version was very clearly NOT just an afterthought, as the game feels very solid to play. Controls are responsive, I haven't noticed anything overtly clunky--except for one tiny thing: opening doors. Sometimes the doors want to ""stick"" even when they are supposed to be unlocked. A small, minor complaint here, but that is why it got a 7 instead of an 8. The other missing points comes from run speed; the ""running"" feels pretty slow. Without being able to play in VR though, I can't say if that is just a PC thing or if it feels the same way for VR players.

Gameplay: Solid 9/10. The game has some bugs, but there is a LOT of content here. For one, the houses seem to spawn slightly differently each time. The ghost can be one of many different types, and the main rooms it haunts will switch every playthrough. So even the same maps can play very different. The equipment works really well and convincingly accurate to IRL equipment. Playing with friends is a very solid experience. The atmosphere is creepy as hell, and the ghost types themselves are very scary. This is one of those games that shines despite some bugs such as clipping, or other minor things.

Horror/atmosphere: 10/10 here.  The game has a lot of jump scares, but where it differs from other games is it ALSO has a LOT of atmospheric terror. Even with friends the game is scary as hell, let alone playing by yourself. The ambiance is great, the noises and things the different ghosts can do to scare you is really well thought out. This game will scare you before you ever even come close to seeing whatever haunts the building you are in, let alone if you DO have the misfortune of seeing it!

Developer Activity: This is a big one for most considering playing an early access game. The devs are super active in their discord and this game has been updated twice in the two days I have been playing it. They actively answer questions and take feedback given in their bug reports very seriously. 10/10 here, this is easily one of the most active devs I've seen in an early access game. This is definitely not abandonware!

OVERALL: I would give this game a solid 8/10. The few bugs here and there, and the couple minor issues I mentioned with controls knock off a few points, preventing me from giving it a 10. This game honestly could be $30 dollars and still worthwhile. The devs are super active and supporting of their game, and they listen to feedback. The game is legitimately fun to play, the horror aspect is amazing, the game gets your blood pumping!

If you ever wanted to be a paranormal investigator, this game gives you that experience and more. Easy for me to recommend, solid title, and I very much look forward to seeing what happens moving forward with this game.

50,Phasmophobia,76223494,english,"This game has refreshingly original gameplay mechanics. The developers created a tension and build up of fear that is achieved through subtly instead of cheap jump scares.  There are currently 10 different kinds of spirits with different appearances. Each have different characteristics which you must identify before ultimately taking a picture of. Through the use of room temperature, spirit boxes, journals, smudge sticks, crucifixes, uv light, cameras, night vision cams, radio comms, etc, you can track the spirit and gather information.

The gameplay mechanics work really well with the (up to) 4 player co-op. A player can use the ghost hunting van outside the building can be used to relay important information to the others inside, or everyone can go inside at once to get closer to winning. Once you finally get a photograph of the spirit, it is saved in your player notebook as part of the greater collection. You finish the round by closing the van door and heading out of the area.

There are optional objectives for each round and with the money you earn, you can purchase more ghost hunting tools which can be lost in a failed round. I highly recommend this game for people who enjoy vr gaming, suspenseful gameplay, anything paranormal, and cooperative play.",1600521290,1600521290,TRUE,19,0,0.643197894,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,7.65612E+16,144,4,2642,2279,133,1602036089,,

Pros:
-Game runs beautifully and servers are surprisingly good for a brand new game
-The amount of realism with the tools, like the EMF reader.
-The 3D sound is terrifying 
-The creaks of the houses/farms give it an eerie feeling

Cons:
-4 players does not seem enough, maybe at most make it 5-8 players if possible
-The radio is loud, ear sharpingly loud, fix that and it would be good
-There should be some type of storyline for every house, and the spirits last name should not always be Brown.
