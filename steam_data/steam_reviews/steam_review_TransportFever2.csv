tl;dr: You like modding && you like transporting stuff && Optimizing is your thing? You'll like it.

First things fist: Yes. It feels like every game since TrainFever. Never the less, a little upgrade and added complexity would have made it far more interesting, if you dont only want to build a virtual model railway.

The range of mods and their individual quality are astonishing. Never have I ever relied more on mods than in this game. This is a great achievement for the very friendly, creative and open community. Great job guys! All of you! 

On the one hand it cannot be denied that the developers did an okay job with the vehicles and the cities. But on the other hand... It is just too few to fuel the full game. 

The games performance is okay-ish. But it's not really good. On my 2080RTX with the i9 it sometimes even goes lower then 25/23FPS in late game. Reaching late game with larger maps should not be so uncommon that this poor performance is in any way reasonable. 

Attention. This is my opinion only. Yours might be different, but I would like to feel free to express mine here. 
Rather should they do one thing right then doing three things only by 30%. I would personally have preferred to have a european game with an extensive set of for instance German vehicles. 

After all, my conclusion is: Yes. I do recommend this game, if you like optimising and trains and all the stuff. And of course ... Modding the hell out of it. 
If you dont like modding, it will be boring the second day. Dont buy it then.

20,Transport Fever 2,76943385,english,"This is a great game if you are into any games such as Railroad Tycoon, SimCity, Cities: Skyline, etc.   There is much more of a learning curve to this than most of the Railroad Tycoon games, but that's okay because of all the awesome capabilities.

One thing I especially loved was taking some raw material, putting it on a truck, shipping it to a railroad depot that delivered it an airport,  Then a plane flew it across the map, where it was put on another truck, and shipped to a depot in a town.  After it was processed it made another similar journey to it's final destination.

There are tons of great mods and maps available that really extend the gameplay options.  I've tried lots of crazy things that I'm sure the developers never intended, but who cares!

There aren't many cons to this game.  About the only one I can think of is there are some balance issues.  For example in some cases a fully outfitted freight train will run you as much as a small airport, (or more).  But by the time you are building airports the money doesn't much matter any longer.  

The only CTD I have had with this game has come from a mod that allowed for Meglamaniac  maps, and I played on that map for probably 15 hours before all the planes, ships, trucks, trains, etc eventually overwhelmed my computer and it choked.  It was a really huge map.

I highly recommend this game and I anticipate playing it much more in the future.

Things that didn't work from TF1 have been carried over including bugs that were supposed to have been fixed with TF1! It is really a dlc to make things look nice for TF1!

The modding community really add to the game and do stella work, whereas the devs are lazy and can't be bothered to make the game better!

Will add the pro's and con's later, but at the moment, I am 60% against and 40% for the game. It was a lot higher before, but the frustration with the track laying [which allows you to lay impossible real life track, but not the other way round] and the constant shifting of the catenary masts [I place my own] placement point is a deal breaker for me. You upgrade the speed and they all move. Delete a section of track [as some mods make the distant too far between masts] so you can chose where to place them by redrawing it, makes other masts disappear if they are on elevated ground. 

Routing is stupid in this game. You have to baby step the route by putting numerous way-points in otherwise it makes bizarre detours from the main line. If you alter a consist, it can change the platform number it calls at and the track used. You can NEVER trust it to make an intelligent choice.

Considering 75% of the World's train traffic drives on the left, there is no catering for this [signals], only by mods. Same goes with road traffic. Game comes with very limited running stock, and their should be proper control over how cities expand/grow. There is an option to allow you to change the number of res/com/ind pop, but it reverts back to what it was, so useless! Without mods, you could have villages/small towns with skyscrapers which just doesn't look right and spoils it for me.

Optimisation [cpu/gpu] is poor as it was before. Looks like they were more interested in making a quick buck than really changing anything [bettering it].

Pro: I love the updated graphics and the UI changes, like being able to look around when in camera view. I also love the ability to edit mass information at once on the line and vehicle maintenance.  Sweet. 
Con: Some of the quests are not intuitive at all.  For instance: Mission Paradise, Erace the Traces...   What do we erase?  Does the % show the % of what we have left to remove (100%), or does it show our imprint goal (0%)?  And nothing I do seems to change it.  Another drag is the UI windows..   they are not consistent..  I really dislike how they auto-pin when moved.  Please fix that because we may want to open a few more windows than usual, and just [ESC] out of them.  But we can't if they are pinned.

But it's less challenging for sure and it's up to you personally whether that's good or bad.[*] The progression of time is a primary driver for how profitable you can be. If you start with horses in the 1800s, you make very little money and might even struggle at first in comparison to if you start in the late 1900s, when a fast route with good capacity literally prints money no matter what the route actually does.[*] Performance and RAM consumption has been improved a lot over time with patches.[/list]I dislike:[list][*] Still lacks ships like TpF1 did. There just isn't as much variety as there is for trains or trucks for example. The map generator also doesn't create great ship maps. An archipelago style map is the best you can generate.[*] Road infrastructure is lacking some things you might expect from such a detailed simulation, like the ability to create complex motorway infrastructure or even simple things like smooth motorway on/offramps etc.[*] No construction planning mode.[*] Stats are weak. There aren't enough key financial figures easily available and the graphs are just bad.[*] The map sizes are still tiny considering what decade we're in, the megalomaniac map is still considered ""experimental"" and honestly isn't that big. You won't be making a proper simulation of a continent or even a small nation here, planes are still pretty useless, and it's tough to find a train route where a high speed train gets to accelerate to full speed between cities.[*] Patching for the game is pretty slow and the dev isn't very active in communicating what they're up to.[*] As you progress through the years and cities grow bigger, you can end up with horrible npc traffic jams.

I think key for passenger, is that wise not to had everything, but bus limited to one city area each unless you had 2 city very close to each other, then bus would be still useful, then if there is any river that connect 2 city or cargo from industry, you could use that, if you want, I think that is cheapest and early you can do that, but if willing to spent more money on train and track, it's cost lot to set up and lot of planner, ensure not to get in road way or build way while leave more room for future upgrade design. 

Once you got airport, then set up airport share by few city close by, then find very far, far away on other side of map and do same, then set up by train or bus, to help airport from few city close by. But I do had set up airport for one city and very close, but it's not good due take too much space and limited city grow, and emission because airport gave lot of emission, you don't want city to had high emission because it's will limited or slow grow. I think you can't upgrade small airport to large airport, you had to taken down small airport (1911?) once large airport come out in some year later, (I think 1960 or so? not sure), then you can upgrade second runway once you hit 1980, so some upgrade won't be come up till some year.

Key is look at city and industry and understand to prove it by resource on map that linked raw/goods chain, understand this you would make lot of money easy in long terms. That's key to this game, passenger for all kind transport should come last, after you proved city's goods, City had 2 goods that need to be met, after that city grow, then you can build passenger to make more money, so go on. 

Campaign is little bored to my taste, and very old designed, basic they had many map each, one time mission, then all your work is done and gone once you done with mission,
I rather to had stay one map with many mission, grow from there, rather than use map with simple mission, then next one, and so go on. I think this might be more fun that way. Oh well, but This game is main sandbox or know as freeplay, or you can make your own map, but there is some should done more tool sure as add farm (you can add farm but it's won't grow like normal freeplay) but petty cool to had map editor even it's need some bug fix and add more tool like add animal, you might not see animal on map you make, it's seem it's only work in freeplay map. 

I said game is worth it and fun. I don't mind to pay without sales, but depend on people, if you are not die hard fan of transport fever, and are kind of poor, I would wait till sales, but not sure how often sale come up for transport fever 2.",1599784064,1599784064,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,298,50,1185,0,813,1599877885
96,Transport Fever 2,75719601,english,"I've spent about a month on TF2 so here are the pro's and con's I've found so far.

Pros:
1- if you like TF1 then TF2 is about the same with better graphics
2-Building train rail systems is loads of fun in this game
3- Map Editor is much improved over previous versions
4- Supports mods (This is probably the saving grace for this game)

Cons:
1- The Campaign missions can be tough to follow and I found a bug in at least one mission where I was unable to use the cargo aircraft even after confirming my transportation line was set up properly
2- The game has less resources to choose from when creating maps now. If you build a large map and causes too much repetitive layout on larger maps.
3- The map editor still needs refining. Just wait  until you try to convert from streets to highways, there are no adapter templates to choose from other than a couple like a clover leaf and T for highway intersections.
4- Map editor has very limited assets to choose from, for instance I was making an Atlantic coast map and wanted palm trees and beach sand for the coast and pine trees for inland. If I choose Temperate climate I get no palm trees or beach sand textures, If I choose Tropical Climate I get no pine trees and have palm trees attached assets that I place on the map and cannot remove. For example I place a forest resource on the map and it automatically has palm trees around it, in the middle of a pine forest.

Overall I enjoy the game, just love setting up my costly train routes and watching them run.

That is what I said after playing less than twenty hours.  I have now clocked up almost 1800 hours, so I pause and reflect on TpF2.  It is a beautiful looking game, it really is.  I am slightly tired of mowing down yet another wild animal, but that is peanuts.   I played TpF1 extensively and my regular challenges against the AI was a big part of the game, trying to bend the game to your will building junctions, tunnels and bridges, let alone getting your freight lines working properly.  Then came TpF2.  At first the joy of something looking so good, and it was easy to set up your transport network, the game behaved.  And soon the money flowed, I couldn't spend it fast enough. In gaming terms I had hit a brick wall.  It was too easy.  Where was the challenge? I continue to play but now it is not rising to the challenge of beating the game's stubbornness to comply like its earlier relative, it is in the fine detail you can now create.  At this point a big shout out is needed for the modders (well most of them anyway) for the incredible work they do, what they produce takes the game to another level.  Taking your time once the money is not a factor to create a credible and realistic world (well one that is always sunny and covid free, no masks or distancing on my platforms!) is hugely satisfying, as is spending time to create your own worlds from scratch in the editor.  So this is a brilliant game and i would recommend it to anyone. And for TpF3?  Well the developers have a chassis to take it in different directions.  For me different weather and day/night would be good and if that was coupled with timetabling with a few tweaks a challenging game could result, but hey what do i know!

Sure it has great graphics compared to TF1 but in every other way it is inferior. Many of the irritations of TF1 are still there like the difficulty getting tracks to join up over rough terrain .The campaign missions are no where near as tricky or fulfilling, it's usually just a case of following some steps and you're done, and there are rarely any barriers you need to work around to be successful, other than bugs that sometimes make them impossible to complete. They have made managing vehicles simpler (no need to go back to depot to sell, no increased maintenance) which I never found problematic before.

One of the things that wasn't great in TF1 was the economy, but in TF2 they have somehow made it even more 2 dimensional.

Graphics are great when you are zoomed right in, but who plays a transport simulator zoomed in? This game is style over substance.

If you have never played TF1 go buy that, you won't be disappointed, but if you were hoping TF2 was going to be a step up you will be disappointed.

20,Transport Fever 2,75307919,english,"I have played Transport Tycoon (TTY) since release (sometime back in the 14th century) and still have it running in Dosbox or via OpenTty. After playing this game for over 170 hours - thanks to Covid - I have to write a recommendation. While the single player campaign game is not all that fantastic, it does cover some interesting points in history and I put up with the bugs and silly requests just to get through it and shake my head at some of the turning points in history. I can say I ended up on Wikipedia a few times just to read up about these events. However, this is not how the game was intended to be played - I think it is added for flair. The meat is found within the Free Game mode - I have not tried Sandbox. 

It does a great job of bringing to life all my favorite memories of TTY. I spend hours building my railway lines, planning roads, watching aircraft takeoff and land (although their piloting skills are much to be desired - especially on the occasion the plane flies through the hill on takeoff) - and of course ships steam along the rivers.

I found the tropical setting the most fun as this opens up islands and creates better shipping opportunities. The locomotives from the different regions are well modeled and the graphics are a huge improvement over the first. I do not have space for a desktop and I am running this game on a lower resolution, with a laptop i7, nvidia 930mx. Quite old hardware from 2016. The game runs fine and the sacrifice of resolution is overcome with turning on a little anti-aliasing. I played on medium settings (even with the warning for the video ram) just so I can see the grass! I have played up to large maps, anything bigger and my hardware starts to chug. Even so - the large maps are pretty big!

If you enjoy transportation games, trains, trucks, buses, trams or ships - it is worth playing. Although you will find trucks and trains are your go to place for cargo movement. 

What could be improved?
1. More vehicles! I understand the developers try to open this up to the steam community - but under these circumstances you lose the ability to earn the Steam achievements. 
2. Bigger ships. I would love to see ocean liners, super tankers and post panamax cargo ships. I think this is the biggest let down in the game. The same would be for locks / canals / waterways - it is missing and something that I enjoyed in TTY.
3. More industry types for the Free Play. The campaign has lots of different types of cargo, I found one mod which opens this up for the freeplay and I must say it adds a nice dynamic to the game. 
4. Improved industry outputs, particularly farms. 
5. The UI is a little different to TF1 and this I think went a step backwards.
6. The tutorial / lack of one - this has had me looking a few times on the internet to solve problems. Like trains stations to accept cargo and passenger trains - it is harder than you think and a little annoying. 
7. There is no mail (which is odd), I kind of miss the mail train and wish that cities produces passengers and mail to improve trade between themselves. Considering the postal service was pivotal in history across many geographies, this is a big oversight. 

I recommend playing on easy - unless you want to really challenge yourself on Hard. The costs are insane on hard mode and this starts bringing out the bad in the game - it is nearly impossible to make a cargo route profitable unless you run 20 trucks on it - at which point the system runs like a conveyor belt instead of a transport game. You just can't make a profit from 4 coal trucks running back and forth to the steel mill - which then forces people to start turning to trains, where, you need something like 16 carriages in the 1800s to make it profitable. It just feels clunky. That being said - on easy - it is quick to succeed and so I have a number of games stuck in the 1900s on millions because I got bored. Hence the hard mode.

So yes, it could do with some variety, more industries, oil rigs, power stations, helicopters, double deck trams (aka Hong Kong), or commerce - like ski resorts or seaside resorts - the possibilities are endless. Without this though - it is a fantastic achievement. I must say that you'll want to find more music and if you owned Transport Fever 1 - this really feels like a remake, not a new game - but worth buying.

I hope they take this all under consideration and proceed to make TF3. Even if it feels like a new TF2 and a new TF1... at that point I just don't care - it will give me another excuse to spend 180 hours moving coal :)",1599018838,1599018838,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,53,1,12515,0,10575,1599371776

30,Transport Fever 2,59657353,english,"It has taken a while to learn a number of the new additions.
I love how you can modify a railway station from say passenger to passenger and freight, without having to add a completely separate station.
I found you need a separate line added first and then the different type of platform with its associated Freight or Passenger building {all attached in one location} Marvelous.
The only thing I noticed is a little tricky is on the intermediate stations of a busy section of a route is to get the signalling correctly done.
I found the easiest way {so far} to get Goods/Freight trains and Passenger trains on a busy line, is to double track and provide a scissor crossover at each end of a station, so the trains can reach the appropriate platform. No negative issues so far.
The busier the line becomes there may need to be more intermediate signals provided along the track/s between stations.
The road Depots I have found a little more difficult to update. I have not been able to increase from just one pick-up/drop-off to multiple versions.
Love the addition of being able to fly over your landscape by clicking onto the correct version of the bird formation. Marvelous addition.
The Ports are another great improvement, I just love the way the ships sidle up to the port, like in real life and the sounds provided by the port are a wonderful addition.
Being able to download height maps from the likes of ""terrain.party"" onto the Create a game map are an excellent improvement. I have finally created my first map and uploaded it into the workshop.
It is a map of the area where I live and once had a railway and still has a port and airfields.

This game is better than the first by all means, so if you liked the first game YOU ARE GOING TO LOVE this one. They focused on the quality of life upgrades and they nailed it, game also looks way better now not to mention with a solid map editor.
Only [b]downside[/b] is the lack of vehicles, but have no doubt the community put a ton of them on the Steam Workshop. Both games suffer from that, but since this game is significant upgrade I strongly believe this game get just as good of a modding (steam workshop) community just as the first game one had, if not better.

There are none as of writing this review. But I would definitely not mind getting more vehicles that are theme based of a country with said map and city names.

[h1]Transport Fever 1 Review[/h1]
[quote]Hours on end of fun for certain type of gamer.
This is not a mainstream game. The learning curve is steep you make one mistake and the game will bite your ass off.

This game is for those gamers that can spend hours on end perfecting a layout in Cities: Skylines.
So if you are that type of gamer as mentioned, it will reward you and it will feel great.
Also the workshop is a great addition to this game and much loved.

So far I’ve not had technical problems as other reviewers.
Do look up at ""Can you run it?"" if you are unsure if you computer can run it.

Don't reccommend this game at it's current price of 30€.
Wait until there is a sale on, when it's about 20€ it's worth getting it.

42,Transport Fever 2,74818945,english,"Although I recommend this game, I have somewhat mixed feelings about it. 

I love the new Asian vehicle set (predominantly Russian and Chinese, with occasional Japanese vehicles). The new tropical map makes boats a more useful transportation option. And the ability to change the size of your stations bit by bit as opposed to using preset sizes is very useful. Not to mention there's a new, much longer campaign. 

On the other hand there aren't really any new industries outside of the campaign. Speaking of industries it is possible to still make money (albeit less) with them without completing all connections from resource to factory to town, removing some of the challenge from the first game. The biggest issue I have though is that there isn't enough new content/mechanics to really justify this being a sequel.

44,Transport Fever 2,74781604,english,"The game is ""alright"". I did get many dozens of hours of unmitigated fun out of this title, even if I may list a few criticisms to this game below.

While it doesn't hit every point that the original Transport Tycoon did, Transport Fever (2) is still a worthy ""addition"" to the Transportation genre.

The game does these things well:
1. Laying down large amounts of ""track / road"" at the same time, which is basically a modernization of the original TTD and very similar to what we have in Open TTD.
2. The game is very pretty on ""high"" settings. Zooming in and seeing citizens and vehicle models is strangely cathartic.
3. Game is *very* easy to understand and get into, which is something it has over Cities Skylines.

The game could improve on the things listed below, perhaps through DLC, but you could also potentially sift through the thousands of workshop mods to find a solution for it. Though I would prefer the former due to the clutter of Steam Workshop, many things that are good mods get buried under said clutter.

List:
1. There are very few industries in the game, you get a handful of primary resources and a few secondary resource (processed), finishing into about 3 tertiary resources, and that's really it. Once the game gets through the first 100 years and after paying back your initial debt, you will start to feel ""this is it"", and that's not a good thing.
2. The industry upgrade mechanic needs to be clearer, the goals do not seem very responsive to the player's actions (and many times cannot be met due to the nature of randomized materials.
3. There is no way to directly ""influence"" industries in this game. What you roll at the start is what you need to play with for the rest of the game. Unlike TTD, industries do not get constructed or demolished. This is a huge minus.
4. There is very little realism to the time that passes in this game. At 3x speed a second IRL time passes for about 2.5 days, this is an issue because you will see planes take about 10 days to get from the runway to the departures and then another 10 days to lift off again. Flying across the map takes like a month, which does not make sense at all.
5. Airports need a massive update, when you start building airports, you will clearly see that trains and buses are the ""core"" of the game, the limited ability to upgrade airports is massively off-putting, and by that I mean there is no way to lay more runway tracks in one airport. Airports in the world often have interesting layouts which you will get no way to explore in this game. There is no way to lay additional taxiways, for that matter.

There's probably a few more points but this is probably too long for anyone to read.",1598188955,1598188955,TRUE,101,3,0.906161726,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,253,6,3967,0,3967,1598187655

48,Transport Fever 2,71316336,english,"Unfortunately against my greatest desire I have to post this negative review.

TF2 has fixed a number of quirks from TF1, which is great - especially in the management of large networks.  

However, they've also taken out a lot of mechanisms that made the game challenging.  It's now simply a railroad sandbox.  At first I only noticed that you can change your vehicles on the fly (like, you can swap out a train going 200km/hr for a different loco, and/or add/remove carriages...) - this is in place of them upgrading/etc at a depot, or a station if you program it correctly.

But the removal of increased maintenance is beyond me. 
Moreso is that they've removed the entire concept of supply/demand - how can I just keep transporting raw materials to a factory that is not selling goods????
Even the campaign challenges are now superfluous - they literally mean nothing and are just a tick in the box on your way through the level.

I've now played through to near the end of the second campaign.  I didn't borrow money once.  I didn't even need to set up bus and cargo routes in town to ensure I had an income.

..................... Update after round two

So I decided to give a 'free-game' another shot... after first opening TF1 due to my first experience of TF2.  I will give credit that TF2 free-games are seemingly built for more an end-game type experience... in that the player is just trying to get all the towns to 100% +.  The mechanics seem to work quite well, however still the game is just a click-and-forget experience.  There's 0% difficulty.  I've entertained myself during periods where I just wanted to turn off my brain - so there is that. But seeing that I've got transport lines with horsecarts operating still and its 1950 is a bit stupid.

1) Dumbed down over-simplified Industries.  
2) Ridiculous over-complicated track switching rules (that the game locomotives will often ignore/incorrectly follow for no logical reason) causing endless recurring track blockages that constantly defy most reasonable attempts to fix.  Lack of an 'easy' mode option that would turn train track signaling off and allow multiple trains to run on a single track without collision.  This feature alone would have saved me 50+ hours of frustration (and changed my review to a Positive, instead of a negative!
3) Any game that requires 100+ mods to make the game fun/enjoyable/almost playable is just wrong for a AA title that I bought for $34.99 (or more, at launch with the TF1 discount)
4) Lack of centralized warehouses for regional storage of raw materials/finished products.  Cities seem to have a very buggy notion of what goods they want... and will sometimes not accept these when you tray and ship it to them. 
5) Game often generates terrain too wild for easy track laying, even with mountain/hills turned off.  Laying track tends to create far too common tunnels or logic defying mile-high viaducts.  Game also limits the tightness of train track curves so guiding a semi-path through hills is nearly impossible without terrain editing tools to lower/smooth the grades into something the game will reluctantly accept.
6) VERY SLOW dev patching of critical bugs.  NO significant added features since launch.  Dev's go 3-6 months at a time without updating the community

Absolutely I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys transport / logistics management games. This is a game which has given me many, many hours of enjoyment, and which I never grow tired of playing.

The graphics are beautiful to look at, both vehicles and environment. It does feel like a living world you are interacting with, and it is fun just to set your camera at some random viewpoint and watch the world go by.

The new map generators are fantastic. They are capable of generating much more believable worlds than before, with more variety, especially with workshop generators added. I personally enjoy the tropical generator with an islands modifier from the workshop, as well as an Appalachian mountains modifier from the workshop (which happens to be the region I live in IRL).

The goods supply chain works a bit different than in the older versions, in some ways good and simplified, but personally, this is my least favorite change. I liked the way goods distribution worked better in the last version. There are however workshop downloads which improve the distribution methods, and these do a good job, with different modifiers to suit different distribution models. There are also expanded supply chains in the workshop which really add a lot of game play variety. So for this, I would say the out-of-the-box was a step backward, but the community has made good of it.

On the other hand, the new supply chain is probably perfect for new players to learn the game, and with the ability to mod so many aspects of the game, we are free to make it the game we want.

Again, I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys transport , logistics, and management type games.

1,Transport Fever 2,59766414,english,"I played 1000+ hours of Transport Fever 1. With great anticipation I waited for the release date of Transport Fever 2. Now, two weeks later, and 60+ hours of play time, I've founded my first impression. As an enthusiast of the genre, [b]I'm disappointed[/b], but I can see that for new players, TpF2 is a better game. But back to the start.

[h1]The obvious[/h1]
The game looks [b]gorgeous[/b]! The views are impressive. The game looks so much better then TpF1. It is a real pleasure to sit back and watch trains run through the landscape. The developers put a lot of effort in making the game look good, and make it attractive to play with. They succeeded in this aspect.  They even extended the possibilities to modify the landscape, coastlines, add new cities or delete them (in sandbox mode). In all, it good looks very nice, but what about the game play?

[h1]The modular stations[/h1]
One of the major upgrades are the modular stations: the system to assemble your station, and adapt it to the local situation. It is very well done, quite intuitive to use, and for new players it's a big leap forward.
TpF1 started with very limited station configurations, but the latest modded complex station could be bendy, on slopes or underground, varying platform lengths and width, ... The degree of freedom was huge. The new simple modular stations of TpF2 are for more for the casual players, but for the hardened TpF players, the [b]modular concept is a step backwards[/b]. No bendy station, no sloped stations, no underground stations... let's see what mods can bring us,

[h1]Two cargo types per city[/h1]
Another obvious change to the game is the concept of the cargo system. The cargo system of TpF1 was demand based. Every industry delivered the amount of cargo based upon the demand, and this through the entire chain of products. But this system had a problem. Cargo production chains could be very long in distance and time, from primary resource to destination. It was possible that the entire demand of a specific cargo type was in transit, and the mine or farm halted the production because the amount of demand had been produced. The production chain halted, and started to degrade because of the lack of production. 

This lead to great frustration with players, and became a major concern with the developers. So, they came up with a new cargo system. The concept changed from a transport simulation game into [b]a logistics puzzle game[/b]. They removed a couple of cargo types that seemed too confusing, and simplified the production chain. They also reduced the number of cargo types that can be delivered to a city: namely only 2. And that makes a huge difference in the experience of game play.

Some find this a better system, more clear and more ""challenging"" to solve the logistics puzzle. But many experience this as a dumbed down simulation system. In stead of making TpF2 a more complex and engaging transport simulation experience, they made it more casual and targeted for the newcomers, to make it more accessible for them to grasp and start. But the seasoned players, who have been playing Train Fever and Transport Fever, are mostly very disappointed by this simplified cargo system: a great deception even. But one point in favour of the new system is that production is now steady and more reliable.

[h1]Maintenance[/h1]
Vehicles have a maintenance cost. But maintenance has no direct influence on their breakdowns, nor does it limit life span. [b]They keep on running, even centuries[/b], without any problem. Maintenance has an influence on pollution, but the pollution game is underwhelming. Apart from reducing city growth, there are no other consequences. Vehicle maintenance has been reduced to something that does not matter anymore. What a pity, what a strange decision. But probably all in favour of the casual player who is not interested in deep simulation, the burden of break downs, vehicle replacements and technological evolution. The automatic replacement option has been removed, and trains do not return to the depot after service. The depot has become a mere spawn point for the vehicles. Depots could as well be removed from the game as they are now: they are pointless.

[h1]Money Fest[/h1]
TpF2 is a money fest. Even on hard difficulty [b]it is difficult not to make money[/b]. It is so easy to get rich quickly, that it is no fun, The Tycoon players who seek a challenging game of company survival, investments and grow, will be very, very disappointed. Making money is a laugh, so that it is pointless to play as a tycoon and to become rich and powerful. It's too easy.

[h1]All In Line[/h1]
People in TpF1 had 2 criteria while deciding the route they took to their destination: cheapest or fastest. This was fun, to have trains and buses, ships and planes. The traffic splitted and building an alternative route was fun. With TpF2 all people will use the shortest route. No alternatives. All traffic will use the same route, which results in huge traffic jams. Buses are empty, highway not used, planes are pointless, because all traffic follows the same route, into a same traffic jam. This is a major step backward, and simplification of the code backfired into a transport game of traffic jams.

[h1]Shipping cargo into the void and getting payed[/h1]
All resource industries produce cargo no matter if there is a demand for it or not. The player just ships whatever he can, and all cargo without demand, is thrown away into the void after transport. The player received huge transport [b]profits for shipping cargo without destination[/b]. This pointless transportation of cargo is just to make the player rich, but without any need for the game world of needs and demands. In the end, shipping cargo seems really pointless and meaningless, because the impact and consequences in the world is not in relation. This is a big fail of the game.

[h1]Stopping the calendar[/h1]
A popular mod in TpF1 was to alter the calendar time progression. Some people love to play it slower, and enjoy the atmosphere of certain eras, eg steam. With this mod players could slow down the calendar time progression, without influencing the challenges.
In TpF2 you can alter the calendar progression, and even stop it entirely. The idea was great but the implementation is flawed. If one has a profit of 1 million per year on normal calendar progression speed, then changing it to 1/2 speed, the profits will double!. On 1/4th speed, one gains 4x the initial profit, and when stopping calendar progression, [b]one can earn infinite money![/b] This is totally against the simulation principle, that yearly profits remain the same no matter how fast years go by. This calendar slider might be called the cheat mode slider. It is clear that the developers do not care about the simulation aspect; to try and keep the financial balance in the green. What was a brilliant idea, became a joke due to wrong implementation.

[h1]Smooth[/h1]
To conclude, the game is slick and streamlined for the newcomers and casual gamer. But for the simulation seeker and tycoon gamer among us, TpF2 does not deliver. The game has been developed based upon fear and limitations. Developers programmed to avoid the major concerns and complaints of the players of TpF1, and restricted TpF2 so these complaints would be avoided. But at the same time they produced a limited version, smoothed and slick, [b]beautiful to look at, but with an empty core[/b]. Experienced player will have to look hard to find the thrill and enthusiasm they expected with a sequel that promised to be more complex and challenging in the field of transportation, logistics and simulation. But none of that as come true. It became just a ""nice"" game, smooth and slick.

[h1]So, the verdict is....[/h1]
I recommend it for the new players, It plays so much better then TpF1. But as a sequel for the experienced players from TF and TpF like me... very, [b]very disappointing[/b].",1576244381,1596699774,TRUE,10,0,0.594774485,1,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,56,10,27306,1929,684,1602084939

What I didn't like: In just about every aspect that I had hoped the developers would touch on and improve over the previous version they seem to have happily glossed over. Something that will really grind your gears is the rail system. As no two trains can occupy the same block of track you will frequently find yourself sorting out train jams even when there is a perfectly viable alternate route available. Some simple A/B decision tree mapping for routing I could have pulled out of my high school C++ book would have helped with this. Another item they didn't really touch on is how to logically block out your routes and vehicles. If you don't add in a naming convention you'll be making some extra clicks to figure out what that vehicle does and ion what route. The intracity vs. intercity transportation routes also need a lot of help. It's generally just HARD to get the data you need to make good decisions.",1596423643,1596423643,FALSE,2,0,0.4909091,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,44,6,1011,0,312,1598561301

It's relaxing, Calming. Enjoyable.
And to be fair, the graphics are pretty great.

There are some bugs here and there.
And although not a bug per say, thigns such as lines not functioning correctly.
And instead of telling you whats the problem it just leaves a generic ""line doesn't work"" error.
So, I've spent literally hours trying to fix a problem that should have been a simple change track type.

I've also noticed that as you get on in years the game begins to struggle.
I stream the game majority of the time and last night, the game could not longer handle.
It crashed and then refused to open the save game (instantly crashed)
So, I was forced to make a new game.

There are a few things I'd like to see in this game improved.
Engine capability being one of them. 
Additions to the landscape. The landscape has no sense of ""life"".
You can see the odd bear now and then. But, it's like... extremely rare.
So, more life would be nice. Like cows grazing. Sheep etc.
Weather changes, so it's not just an eternally sunny day.
There isn't a night cycle either. Just something to give different appearances would be nice.
Additional landscape assets. Castles, caves. Just more things to look at.

Perhaps, a drivers seat view. I realise that is a whole host of additional graphics and assets additions
that need to be made. But, front of train whilst cool, definitely isn't as nice as drivers cabin.

Another addition I'd say this game needs is competition. Just thinking back to Railway Tycoon 2.
One of the major things I enjoyed about it was competing against AI companies trying to outdo them.
Maybe even buying them out and taking over their companies. Such fun!
Which brings me to my final point, I realise this is a sandbox but, there's no REAL challenge. Because you can go in debt endlessly until your company just begins to succeed. And whilst there's limitations on borrowing amount which is decent. It still kind of doesn't matter really.

As it stands I'll probably give this maybe 6-7/10.

63,Transport Fever 2,72625765,english,"I haven't played a Transport Fever game before so I thought I'd give it a go after liking the look in the trailers. I like Cities Skylines and other city builders so I thought it'd be okay, but I wasn't expecting to like it more than the city builder games as I wasn't sure I'd like only having control of the traffic and not buildings.

My expectations were far surpassed, I really like this game, and arguably a lot more than all city builders and other tycoon games I've played in the past! Overall the game is easy to pickup, I only played the first mission and I was set from there. After that, I didn't bother playing the campaign as I personally just like having free will to do my own thing, so I started a free play game.

I've started various save games, each time trying to perfect on a small mistake I made before which made my transport infrastructure slightly weak. It can be a bit difficult to keep track of things once your infrastructure has grown so much, but the game does a pretty good job of telling you where the inefficiencies are once you've figured out what the Production, Shipping, and Transport metrics mean and how they affect each other.

There's one or two things about the game which I think could do with improvement, such as seeing what route some resources are taking - once you've got all your towns linked up, goods might start taking routes you hadn't expected and it gets a bit confusing. Also, I've noticed one or two bugs, like when your train says it has no electrical path and requires reversing in order to fix. However, these issues aren't major and didn't ruin the gameplay at all.

88,Transport Fever 2,72289734,english,"This game feels like it was made by three different groups of developers. 

The first group made the playable vehicles. As far as I can tell, those are perfect: each one is meticulously crafted, not only trains (which are undoubtedly the stars of the show) but every one from the first coach to the last airplane, and not only do they look great but they sound great as well. An obvious work of love. 

The second group designed everything else in the game and the game itself. They are a rather indifferent bunch.  ""A house is a house"", they decided, and so no matter whether you play on Java or in Scotland, the houses are all the same, and so are the people. Anachronisms abound: you'll see women wondering around in crinolines at the end of the 19th century and cars from the thirties and forties driving on the roads at the same time. In Syria. - The game is a simple ""get from A to B"" (or maybe from ""A and B to C and then from C to D"") affair but, to be fair, I did not expect anything more.

The third group are pure evil, the type of sadists that jump on you in the middle of the night shouting ""Gotcha!"", preferably with a long knife in their hands. They designed the starting conditions and most of the campaign, especially the side missions that are clearly meant to frustrate you as much as possible.

Because of the third group (well, maybe I am wrong and they are all the same people, just with triple personalities) I long meant to give the game a thumb down, but finally the first group prevailed.

If it's at full price, it's worth it... but if you're not into tycoon games/don't like really getting into the nitty-gritty of running a successful transportation company, better get it on sale.

Pros:
- The track-laying systems are sweet. If only Cities: Skylines had this capability to lay tracks one at a time with snapping. It's a joy.
- The system is easy to get to grips with, but difficult to master. It tends towards the easy side though - it's fairly trivial to build up a massive bank balance.
- The game looks pretty good. Lots of detail on the models of the trains and other vehicles. The terrain's pretty nice too.
- Huge maps. You can build the rail and road networks you desire, your imagination is the limit (although, I do suggest getting a few mods - particularly with bridges)
- Replay value: There's tons!

Cons:
- It's not really well-optimised, the total inability to maintain a stable framerate even with a beefcake computer rig is a bit annoying at times. But it doesn't crash (unless you overload it with mods), at least, so that's a bit of a positive.
- Certain late-game trains take forever to get to full speed (like 250km/h+), so you might be a little disappointed expecting them to go quick.
- On the subject of rail and road networks, sometimes you'll find yourself fighting with them at times to get them to go where you want them to go; particularly when building bridges. Recent patches released have somewhat helped with this, though - bridges are still a pain unfortunately - there's a minimum height limit required for them so they won't automatically snap to intersecting roads etc.
- Related to this: if you build on some low-lying maps, you'll find issues with networks clipping into the water level, so this can be unexpected.

Basically this game allows you to do virtual train miniatures without spending thousands of dollars in Märklin models and the rent of a garage large enough for your ambitions. 

It's quite fun to design transportation networks and look at everything working together like a clockwork. There is a nice attention to details of vehicles, so train fans can look at their favourite locomotive zooming through the landscape. Passenger simulation is impressive because the game simulates each individual person with a household, a job and preferred commercial areas, plus preferred means of transportation. Quite a lot of depth. 

Oh and tons and tons of mods. Seriously, browse the workshop, it's amazing.

- Rediculous slow loading. Doesn't matter when the game is on 800MB/s SATA SSD. Doesn't matter when I move the game to a 2500MB/s M2 SSD.
- There is some horrible on the fly asset loading. Every time you click a building for the first time on every map, game locks completely for 10-15seconds.
- Every time you change any option like sound volume or something, the game needs to restart. Yes I'm serious.
- If you can't find how the hell to turn buildings, it's in the options under ""Construction option 1"" and 2. Building higher or lower is ""Construction option 3"" and 4. There is also a ""Construction option"" 5, 6, 7 and 8 but I have no idea what they do. I wish there would be a label or something for the game to tell me what it does... For fuck sake. There are also 50 different other options for showing and hiding things that nobody will ever use proven by the fact they didn't bother assigning a shortcut key to it.
- There is a campaign where you have to move half your operation because a volcano is going to explode. Once you do the game is like ""haha loser. just kidding. you did all that for nothing."" I bet because actaully they didn't know how to add some smoke effects and slow moving orange water to make it really happen.

This game is a mess of design.
- No button to place signs spread out over a track anymore.
- Even though this is the second game, the campaign still superglues the tutorial to your hand and locks you out of building freely. You have to do everything exactly as they want it.
- Good luck with the freaking bonus tasks. The game doesn't show you anymore what the task actually is so you have no clue what you need to do.
- There aren't really production chains and consumption anymore. Just transport anything to anywhere and there is always a need and you never need to deliver byproducts.
- When you watch the vehicles on a line, you can't see what they are carrying anymore. You have to click each vehicle on each line to see if you need more or less vehicles.
- There is no way to delete stops on a line. You can only delete everything.
- You have some magic powers making you able to add carriages and upgrade vehicles out driving on a route.

I can't even anymore.
They should have made the new campaigns as DLC for TF1.
But they were greedy. So they made a worse game than TF1, charged full price and aren't even fixing this pile of shit.

Having camera goes automatically bug/glitch like every five minutes and it is super annoying when you just need the map to be still and do something.
I cant reecommend this game. In terms of money. Dont buy it for full price. You would be crazy. I suggest you to wait for at least 50% sale or do not buy it at all.

15,Transport Fever 2,72050824,english,"This is one of the best city building type simulation games I've ever played. I tend to be more into the transit themed games than the city building itself. So I've enjoyed games like Cities in Motion (in particular, CiM 2) more than the Cities: Skylines series. This game hits the spot for me.

Pros:

- Big open worlds, plenty of cities and industries to connect to each other
- Challenging transport goals (sometimes one industry needs something from far away)
- Intuitive building system, for roads, tracks, bridges
- Easy to set up lines. You can add a stop in the middle if you want any time.
- Beautiful graphics. Sometimes you'll stop for a minute to admire what you've built, and you'll zoom in, and be floored at what you're looking at. It looks almost real.
- Good tutorial to ease you into it. The way cargo is transported is a bit tricky to figure out and the tutorial helps.

Cons:

- Some performance problems. With an old i5 system with a GTX 1660 Ti, I can do 90ish FPS, but it drops below 30 if I go into certain construction modes.
- Not a lot of people moving. It seems to be mostly cargo moving. I've yet to figure out how to set up an intercity train that's profitable. This might just be my lack of experience so far.",1593901287,1593901287,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,190,6,1943,0,1123,1600063979

The graphics and game play are all much improved from the 2 prior versions. Depending on what happens with future support, user content and free play (which I have yet to touch), this game could replace Railroad Tycoon 3 as my all time favorite game. (Sid's Civs are a close second.)

Some of you might know me as Orange 46 from Hawkdawg.com, a  railroad tycoon site where I have numerous maps posted for RT2 and RT3.

Now, at 210 hours I am going to take a break. I continue to enjoy the game, but wish that it's economic model was better. The crow flies model and low track vs high vehicle maintenance costs really discourage running busy railroads, where multiple trains share the same tracks. It's fun to ride a train in other games like Railroad Tycoon 3 or Railway Empire and see all the activity on both the main and branch lines. But, to do that in TF2 you need to play on an easier version, but then you lose the fun of having to make difficult strategy decisions because you have run out of cash. Yes,  TF2 does give you tractor trailers which do run on busy roads, but nothing beats a train.

The best part of the game is  the 18 campaign scenarios. It's too bad that no one seems to be able to develop new scenarios. That's where RT3 is king. Tons of user scenarios. There was even a CD published of 100 user Scenarios for RT2. The RT series map editor used drop down menus to make map editing possible for non programmers (or should I say coders).

Too many user maps have randomly generated cities. I find those boring, but 3 cheers to the map makers who have given us real cities. Just having the 18 campaign maps available for free play (with its hard level) would be enjoyable.

It seems to be easier to manage things in TF2. You can add or delete cars or engines on individual trains without going back to the shed. On hard, you can actually make money on less than perfect routes. Yeah, I know, TF was more like one of my RT3 scenarios, but in TF you can't ignore existing lines for too long on hard before things start to go wrong (at least for me), so slightly easier is a plus for me. The graphics also seem to be better.

It's too bad that my PC won't handle the extremely large experimental maps, as there is a very large USA map with very low population cities (just like in some my RT maps) that I was making glacial progress in that I had to stop because of too long loads and finally lagging while playing - and I had only connected 2 cities by rail and the rest by boat or horse cart from Northeast Canada to Boston.

Hi!

Here are my impressions on the game as someone who played TF1 and even Train fever and the good old OpenTTD.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
The PRO 

- The vanilla game is in my opinion the best in history. Best graphics, even better gameplay and deeper management which is important in my opinion because it is both a management and contemplation of what you have built game. For newcomers it is the best one.

- A lot of QOL compared to the first one. Station modularity is nice
=> This should be a must have in a few months, see below

-----------------------------------------------------------------
The Average/CON depending on one's sensibility

- Workshop is still very light as the game just released, which makes the game feel not that good compared to the previous one. Not the dev fault of course, and this should be solved in a few months

- Average stability and performance, but still way better than the first at launch. Again, wait a few months. On my I7 9700k with 2070+ and 16+Go DDR4 i can run the large map without issues but a little bit slow with the game max speed in late game and just a few cities/cargo covered. Megalo dont load when they did on TF1 on a lower computer. But large is already very large (is it larger than in TF1 equivalent? not sure)

-  The game is TF1 version 1.5 more than 2 as many have said. you get 50% more asset with Asia and it seems like this is all, and you find your old assets back from TF1 for europe and USA.

- Road and track placement is much much better with elevation. But this could go even further with more choices and a more tolerant collision system which i find a bit rigid right now,

- The little thing i dislike: in TF1 it could be a pain to close the multiple windows of vehicles, and it is solved now, onlyu one window at a time. But sometimes two or three windows would be nice to have, for example when taking a loan to complete a train purchase.

- The emission system doesnt make sense to me. Electrical vehicles dont pollute less than steam and diesel ones, Also, the age of vehicle does not seem to have any influence on maintenance costs anymore which was something i found very logic,


To conclude, i will come back to it in a few months. Should you buy it ? Of course, the developer has always supported their games. It is a good game today which suffers from the shadow of its predecessor. It will be a great game one day, thanks to the support and to the awesome modders we have.

Please developers, keep doing this great serie until I die and dont hesitate to add DLCs with new gameplay. Monorail over road, subway... Remember the multiple level train station mod on TF1? Well the station modularity would make such a thing so nice,

Why you ask ??

Pro's

Trains!
Immersive use of older transport that ages in time to modern day transport.
Track laying and route setting is well cool!
Very satisfying riding your new vehicle with the first person camera.
Mod support is really good.
Map Editor is well made and fun. (was for me anyway)
Amazing scenery.
Trains!


Con's

You can't drive the train or other vehicles (yet?)


This may seem biased but I can't pick off any more faults, it's a truly amazing game and worth every penny, there is no other transport game that I have played that offers the 3D look with all the insides off a complex transport machine.  Thanks for this game, I really love it!!

A couple of bad points are that some of the colours during the in game experience sometimes appear to blend into one and are not as clear as the predecessor.  
Also once you have really gotten going in the game, it is heavily CPU based and can cause some lagging later on down the line. I currently have an Intel i5 3470 with 8gb RAM and a GeForce GTX970 in my PC and once my cities get to a decent size with multiple lines running throughout it the CPU can struggle to keep up, this is however after many, many hours dedicated to 1 map.

14,Transport Fever 2,71092200,english,"I have not played TF1. So it was immediately apparent to me what game heavily inspired this installment. Thousands of fans of Transport Tycoon Deluxe will instantly and heartedly recognize the gameplay mechanics down to the minute detail. So much so I tend to think of TF2 as ""TTD remade with modern and better visuals"". And indeed the visuals are stunning, but, frankly, only in comparison with the original TTD. You have got the true 3D, smooth terrain, no grid, vehicle front camera view, wildlife, pedestrians, animated industries, car traffic etc -- all that was previously left for imagination.

There are, however, certain decisions in TF2 design we fans with hundreds of OpenTTD playtime experience will find dubious at best. The TF2 gameplay in general is very rough and a bit far from polished logic, complexity and capabilities of craftily modded OpenTTD. The following is the list of such technicalities that made me squirm.
* You can not make stations into hubs, that is, place a bus terminal and a train station adjacent to an airport and work with it as a single station; also you can not assign a tram to stop at an airport or a passenger train station;
* Sending vehicle into depot makes it forget what line it was working on before that; also you can not skip stations in the schedule;
* Semaphores/traffic lights are dumb and are only good in making simple -O- loops;
* There is no obvious way to build a bridge or tunnel wherever I want as was in TTD; you have to manipulate terrain in a very specific way which is not too easy since it is now smooth in geometry and in elevation as well; short bridges/tunnels are not possible at all;
* For reasons unknown, assigned routes must include not only station, but a platform too; this make it hard to connect two doubletracked stations by double track without crossings and keep two trains running same schedule; this essentially forces you to join tracks before the route enters the station at either end and place a bunch of semaphores;
* For the same unknown reason the cargo waiting on the station for Line A train can not be picked by the Line B train even if that will make your logistics more efficient;
* There are only three loading actions available -- load if any, full load any, full load all; No unload?
* Carriages age separately from the engines;
* The pricing of the engines is outrageous, even if more realistic;
* You can sell a vehicle in a mid-flight or mid-transit between stations without having it in depot;

This list is far from complete, it only includes what I remember after a several days of casual play.
Still I can assert that TF2 has made a good attempt at replicating and enriching the elegant OpenTTD aesthetics but there is a lot of work still to do.

Definitely recommend, especially for OpenTTD fans.",1592681791,1592681791,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,106,3,1134,0,1130,1592926151

Honestly guys... There's just no reason to play. No challenges. No AI. No competitors. Not even random events... The campaign is the most infuriating non skippable tutorial there is. Not to mention the voice over was muted 2 missions in because I already know all the game mechanics. Devs, Do you really think your playerbase have such low IQ's that we need spread out missions with completely limited movement and decisions? This game is a complete and utter waste of time. Just get OpenTTD and call it a day. If you dont know what openttd is, google it. You'll have far more fun for way way cheaper. Might even be free.

*If you remotely liked the transportation in Cities: Skylines or have played/enjoyed Cities in Motion, you **must** try this game.*

**The focus**
The game gives you the option to ""focus"" on one aspect of the game and truly excel at it. These are:

**Cargo**: Ship cargo, help manufacture goods, and earn money from it.
**Passengers**: Make money by getting people from point A to point B.

Both of these let you expand cities, to continue to make even more money. They are entirely different paths, and both let you have tremendous amounts of fun.

Some details on the methods of transportation:
**Road**: Build roads. Build depots. Make trucks/buses go down roads, to make loads to cash. Not much to say here.
**Train**: Build train tracks. These are actually really neat: They snap to the sides of roads, tell you what the speed limits are, and have optional canaries for electric trains. You also aren't forced building pairs of rails: Every rail is built individually, and will snap to each other if so so wish to have them next to each other.
**Sea**: Build docks, and a shipyard. Again, not that complex. If you have bridges, make sure to keep them tall for boats to go under.
**Air**: Radically expensive. Get from point a to point b with minimal building, but be careful doing this outside sandbox mode.

General Pros:
 - Absolutely **beautiful** map generation. Every time you run it, it makes maps on par with cities skyline's. This alone almost wins the game.
- Pretty good pathfinding
- Intelligent trains

General minor issues:
- You can't choose which route a train/truck/ship takes to get from point a to point b.
- There are some rare pathfinding bugs which are game-ending.

73,Transport Fever 2,70089284,english,"So i'm through part 1 and 2 of the campaigns and ready to pass on a few comments on the game so far.
I will most likely update when the game receives updates.

Me, i have played this genre of games since Railroad tycoon 1 on the Amiga.
Until a few years ago i held Railroad tycoon 3 as the game to match in this genre.
Then, some years ago, we got Train fever and later on Transport fever 1, Railroad empire arrived and coming along fine is Mashinky. So it is a great time for the genre.
Transport fever 2, Railroad empire and Mashinky all have a different take on the genre and therefore each have their bright points and less bright/bad sides.
By the way, basicly i recommend all three games :-)

Since this is about about TPF2 my comments for game:

This game has been changed/optimized since it's origin in Train fever and come some way.
The graphics is nice and work well. There are some minor negatives though, not really bad, but a little odd that buildings are used freely between the 3 continents. Also as an example cargo stations in 1850 has electric light posts and euro pallets....

The game has well working mechanics to manage your transport empire. Signals work well.
One could of cause always wish for more.

The game could use some better more detailed track/road building functionality.
But what is there works okay.
However i don't understand why a double track feature has not been implemented. It would be such a time saver.

Keyboard and mouse controls work well and are 'responsive'.

Motor vehicles have issues, but are in line with todays standard. Specially i get sad when seing that vehicles don't overtake slower ones and just pile up on multiple lane roads. But this is something other games also struggle with (cities skylines..). 

I do wish though that it is should be possible to zoom out further. On big maps the zoom level is not enough.

I miss that the developer has not included some well made quality maps to play.
Except for the campaign, the game relies on the map generator and what people publish in the workshop.
It would not be out of order to expect some nice quality maps handmade by the developer.
The map generator just creates random generated maps with no clear logic in where industries a placed. You have all types industry placed random amongst each other which makes no sence in 'the real world'.

I enjoy the campaign. It is good at teaching the game basic elements.
There are however campaign goals that seem rather odd and not very well explained.
It would have been nice if the campaign maps were available to play in free game mode.

Late game for cities shows issues. The game could use some better road tools and the way the game auto generates the streets and the growing cities are not easy to align with good traffic flow. The game developer really needs to focus on this for future updates or a TPF3

The game has bugs, but the developer is active on working on these.
I haven't personally found anyone that are a deal breaker, only rather annoying.

I also wish they would implement some higher graphical settings.
I 'love' going into the FPS view for the vehicles. But the graphics doesn't do all that well with textures pop ups in the near horizon and shadows. The drawing distance really need to be higher.

Overall i recommend the game.
My biggest let down with the game is that the developer has not included some quality hand made maps. Besides that the whole city growth issue is also a rather big concern.",1590921209,1591355064,TRUE,24,0,0.738897979,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,141,3,4210,0,2575,1592147257

        After I played the original Transport Fever I was immediately hooked on the gameplay style which is super easy to use and understand and not to mention the map editor which allows you to pretty much create a world from scratch which is great fun. When Transport Fever 2 came out on steam you can bet I bought it right away and let me tell you that is was one of my best purchases i've ever made with its jaw dropping graphics and new vehicles to play around with that the original Transport Fever lacked. Not once have I ever played and stopped because I was bored and on that topic may I add that i've never actually ran into any parts of the game that i've found boring except building long lengths of railroad track but that's about it. Whats awesome about this game is how much you can micro manage if you so desire such as being able to see the names of every single person in your cities / towns and how your able to paint any car, train, bus, tram, etc. whenever and wherever you want. A very similar game City Skylines which I also own pales in comparison to the high detail and polish this game has and you can bet Transport Fever 2 has many more vehicles and variety than City Skylines as well. 
         The only griefs I have with this game are as follows...
1. The games high level graphics make it impossible for a good ammount of gamers to experience the game to its full potential however I found running the game on medium graphics works just as well with some minor lag spikes at times as cities continue to grow. 
2. Sometimes placing track and road can become slightly tedious and on occasion can be frustrating to use but I found this only when going near or around mountains and very slightly off leveled terrain. 
3. Vehicles don't automatically upgrade as years go by so you must replace all supply vehicles and buses in all cities to make sure they have the best carry weight and speed.

3,Transport Fever 2,69775186,english,"If you are a fan of Transport Tycoon, OpenTTD or TTD; this is the game for you!
Clearly the developers have also played these games too as they have improved on many aspects; trucks are actually useful, you can build in cities (no local councils), replace/edit/update vehicles without sending them depots, financial stats on individual lines/vehicles, the list goes on.
The graphics are superb; you can even see the indicators on the trucks as they drive through the city when in third person mode! 

Like all games there are some minor issue; building bridges can be tricky (see tip #1), naming of lines could be automated, campaign is a bit ... odd. But Free Play is just like good old Transport Tycoon, slowly build up a network and expand; before becoming a super power with lightning fast trains!

Here are some tips for new players; I have more but they are fun to discover for yourself:
#1 - bridge building. I found it easiest to build the up-ramps at both ends first (you need to click the little arrow next to the tick and cross), then build the bridge spanning the gap. If the word 'collision' appears or the bridge starts connecting with objects below your ramps aren't high enough. The same works for tunnels, obviously use down-ramps ...
#2 - deliveries for cities. I found that some of my lines stopped making money. Checking the Secondary Industries that fed the city the demand had dropped off completely at my station; not because the city didn't want it but because as the city had grown the industry had moved away from my station. Lower demand here meant upstream industries demand had also dropped off. Moral of the story make sure you stations catchment covers the industry you are shipping to.
#3 - station connectors. Train station (or any other station for that matter) cannot just be randomly build near industries or cities like Transport Tycoon, they need to 'connected'; by this I mean a little path needs to connect them. This simplest way is to build a road from your station entrance to the industry or city in question. If all goes well when you have the station selected the industry or builds within the catchment will highlight white.
#4 - do the first Chapter of the campaign. It is frustrating, I had to Google some of the quests. But ultimately it does teach you how to play the game.",1590405565,1590405565,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,80,1,6049,0,3647,1598312958

18,Transport Fever 2,69485893,english,"This is a hard one really. I wish there was a third option, maybe, for rating rather than just yes or no. 

It is a good game. Not great, good. Looks pretty and can be quite entertaining for many. If you are completely new to the genre, it might even be great. It's got detailed models of vehicles, it has simple logic what to do and how, move stuff around. Easy. It might challenge you, it may not challenge you, depends on you really. But for a TPF1 veteran like me, it's boring. 

Somehow, it lost its magic on this upgrade and after around 60 hours, I find myself going back to the first version. Only 2 cargo items per city is not a deal breaker here. It gives you a bit more challenge and you have to think more, that's fine. But refunding your build errors? Restoring landscape after deleting tracks etc? Limited city sizes? New emissions mechanism which reduced the max population in relation to emission amounts in the city? Sure, but why don't i have any way to reduce them? The miniscule differences between vehicles makes no difference. Maintenance or lack of it affects couple of points. But that's it. That's all you can do. Does your truck do 71 or 68 on emissions makes no difference. So why bother? 

Also, since the upkeep cost for vehicles doesn't go up over time and the emission effect is minimum, only reason to repair or replace vehicles is cosmetics and capacity / speed. Where is the fun in that? 

There is some nice additions too, like how you can now edit individual vehicles or bunch of them, replace all buses on couple of clicks etc. But that doesn't make up to what was lost. 

So, if you are new then maybe this is good for you. Maybe you'll enjoy Transport Fever 1 more. I know i do, as do many other ""veterans"". For a TPF1 veteran, this probably isn't for you. You'll like it for a while, but eventually you'll find it boring and start looking back into TPF1. 

Also, even after 6 months out, this doesn't seem that have that many good mods compared to TPF1, especially American / USA vehicles. Looks like people who made large chunk of them are still with the old game. I know i'll be there too except few occasional visits to this when i want some eye candy.

31,Transport Fever 2,69403561,english,"I think its a sound time for a review and more so after I watched the latest episode of Colonel Failure mainline series; he was half way through the episode and then went into a review of game.

I agree with all he said, the game graphically speaking is steps above TP1, however is that enough to hold my attention or the game players?

He spoke about the emissions, when he mentioned this, I was like, oh yeah, the game has emissions. It seems to be an add on in which adds nothing to the game play, the towns grow no matter what, emissions or no emissions it doesn’t stop a town, this game play could have had so much extra level detail, but it missed the point.

The area I believe its missed the point massively, is the economy, playing against another company or online people, meh, its hit or miss, however when you are playing TF1, you had to think out lines, think out what you’ll do, and replace trains when they get to their end age. In this version nothing, you don’t need to replace the trains/trucks/boats, they just look like rust buckets, but the profits still role back in. If an update from the developers was done, this is the one thing I am requesting they install back in the game, costs for transport increases as the game gets older. 

The economy could have also been tweeted, why does it cost the same to build a line in 1850 as it does in 1990 – surly the game should have had a built in CPI that increases every year or 10yrs, even if it’s only 1.5% increase, it would then add complexity to the game, or a level of hardness that TF1 had.   

Which bring me to the biggest issue with the game, in the scenarios you have a range of wonderful goods that are required to be delivered to the towns. In free mode, the same as TF1, why wasn’t it changed in TF2 to allow a user when they created a map for themselves to have an endless supply of goods they wanted to transport? This would have created a greater play through and also add some major complexity to supply lines. Towns could still have 2 products, which is fine, but make it more random. 

Overall a great game, that has brought many hours of enjoyment, but the developers as much as they went forward, also went backwards with the game. Fingers are crossed that updates to the game bring some hardness back to the game and most of all curved stations. I doubt a developer will read the comments by a little Australian on the other side of the globe, but thanks for a great game, now can we just define it with a great update? 

I give it 7 / 10 – graphically awesome, game play good, just needed two more months in development to get the news part correct.

37,Transport Fever 2,69325023,english,"Transport Fever 2 is my favourite game in its genre. In my experience, it surpasses both City Skylines and Planet Coaster, both high quality games at the top of their respected fields. The reason for these games inferiority over Transport Fever is simply down to the differences in how the game operates.

In both City Skylines and Planet Coaster, you start with nothing, where the aim of the game is to correctly organise a bunch of parts to where you have one, large, profitable entity at the end of the game (e.g. the city or theme park). In Transport Fever 2, you start off in a world where there are already pre-built and positioned components. The aim of the game is not to place a bunch of parts to form a single entity, but to connect these already existing components to one another in an organised and efficient fashion to produce a collection of interconnected systems that work together to produce as high a profit as possible. At the end you are left with many small connected entities which work totally independently rather than one, mass functioning entity. It's for this reason I like this game so much.

To conclude, I would highly recommend this game to anybody interested. With its unique game mechanics and super satisfying gameplay, all other construction and management games feel inferior! Though what do I know, since, realistically, it is all down to personal preference :)

Also a lot easier on Hard mode compared to TF1 as your vehicles only lose value and produce more pollution once they get older instead of being more expensive to maintain. Also you can now edit trains while they're on track. Or tell a vehicle to drive back to the garage to be sold, only that now it's sold on the spot.

The one thing that makes me give a thumb down is that there is no overtaking of slower cars. Which makes multiple lane roads pretty much redundant. In my case i had a long range bus between two cities on a highway and a more recently truck line to provide grain to a factory. 3 lanes, but all private cars and trucks getting stuck and forming long lines behind the slower busses.

Overall it is good and, especially if you never owned Transport Fever, worth buying.

Now, saying all that, there are pros and cons between this and the original.
The pros are quality of life features - especially the station editor which makes a huge difference if you don't think it is realistic to build maximum length stations from day one. It is also prettier and performs better. Trams also seem to run better. There are also many more useful stats - it is much more obvious why things do and do not happen.

The major con, in my view, is that logistically it is even easier than the first one. In Transport Fever you had six things to  deliver to each town to make it grow. Now it is just two. Saying that the two seem more important for growth than the six were before.

Generally, like TF one, once you figure out how to make money it is pretty much free-form train set building. It is fun, but not exactly a challenge. Saying that you can make some great train sets with a little road support for certain things.

To be honest, once past the early years where trains are just not profitable in hard mode, it becomes a train game with everything else just there for variety.

Still it is fun - which is the main reason for the recommendation, if a little qualified.",1589068039,1589068039,TRUE,20,0,0.740988433,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,32,10,11949,0,9285,1590800517

94,Transport Fever 2,68814412,english,"I have put over 3000 hours of game time into this franchise across the years. For this reason, it is with a heavy heart that I must do what I do here. But I not only cannot recommend this game, but feel I am obliged to actively discourage anyone from buying it.
The TL;DR version: they broke it. And did so because they have implemented a ""feature"" which had previously been handled by a mod, but the developers did so in a way that was so badly done, they massively unbalanced the game, and ruined it.
The longer version: in earlier incarnations, time in the game could be dilated (slowed down) or compressed (sped up) with a mod. Note: this is completely separate to changing the speed of the game. 
Changing the game speed (which has always been an option in the game) merely changes how fast things happen. The day goes from a being a second long to half or quarter of a second, and all the mechanics such as maintenance, revenue, cargo generation - they all happen at the same rate per game day/game year etc.
In earlier versions (Train Fever, Transport Fever), the mod that sped up or slowed down shifted how fast or slow things happened *within game time* so a game year might be longer but the maintenance costs/revenue per unit of cargo/rate of cargo generation was similarly slowed. This made longer routes, or less frequent routes, viable.
In the implementation of this feature into the heart of the game for TpF2, the developers did not factor these changes in the financial aspects of the time compression/dilation, and because the time multiplier can be changed *within the game* (unlike the mod which, once active, could not be turned on and off at will) they have massively unbalanced the economic side of the game, making it unplayable.
As such, I urge you to not spend your money.",1588975933,1588975933,FALSE,3,0,0.483244896,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,77,4,1714,0,358,1589461047

Towns still refuse to grow on max population beyond 2-3k no matter what! :// Furthermore if you set great public transport (e.g. Trams/Buses) in towns they become Ghost cities. Nothing else is moving in town except your bus/tram lines vehicles. 2k town pop with no people walking on the streets. With the rare ocasion of a car coming to your city and vanishing soon after.
And to top it all found the best ""money cheat"" in game. If you play a map on mid or large and set a Air Cargo route your set for the rest of the game length. No more worries with cash flow whatsoever.... I bet this works on small maps too. And it works regardless of the size of your cargo planes.

So where is the fun then if you get unlimited mountains of cash as soon as you can build an airport and service a cargo line? ...

Air cargo if you ask me should only satisfy the demand of a product/good and as revenue to just offset the transport with no profit.


---------------------------------------------------

TF1  Was awesome! I have over 900h played. The Free mods made it better and better by every addition. But sad to say that TF2 atm feels more like a UI DLC + some extra features. Some sort of Transport Fever 1.5. 

One of the best mods in TF1 was curvy stations, bendable ones. TF2 does not provide one.  The grey overlay when your looking at data layers is not appealing at all, hard to distinguish between features. Also the colors representing the  layout in towns are very pale and sometimes hard to spot a green in a sea of yellow or a yellow in a sea of green buildings.  POV camera on trains has issues as you can look from under the map ...  The street conections between the train stations and any road only link it as tiny foot paths, what is that @Urban Games?! Looks unreal and ridiculous. You should be able to connect a full road to a train station and not a foot path! All in all so far TF2 is an disappointment.  But in Urban Games fashion as they listen to their customers things should be fixed in a future patch (very soon i hope). Until then stick to TF1 for a real challenge. 

P.S.  Many, many people complain on Streams in regards to the towns population size. I had in TF1 towns over 7k constantly. It seems here that in TF2 that number cant EVER be achieved as the max number is preset no matter what you do. Please fix this.

This is more like Transport Fever 1 HD, than an actual sequel. Mechanically, the game is identical to 1 and just as solid, with some tweaks here and there but nothing that will really make you lose your hat.

Game is lacking end content but with mods you can get some better experience and by that i mean expanding cities and lines you don't get much satisfaction because you don't have any end goals other then your desires. No natural disasters, no inovations, researchs anything to keep you engaged like Cities:Skyline.
Even on hard mode i get so much money that after some time i can't spend it no matter what i do even if i have the most expensive trains, planes.
One big downside for me is the perfomance issue that you get when you start playing games on very large maps no matter how good are your PC specs.
Game is just not optimized by developers because once you get big transport lines, passengers going everywhere game begins to stutter.
So for example you start new game in 1850, 16 cities , everything looks smooth, you start decorating cities, lines, you become very satisfied with your city, become proud of yourself that you managed to make big transport lines and then advancing through years 2000-2050 you start realizing the stutterness when clicking through cities, adding new stops, rearanging lines etc... so you start surfing web on how to optimize game, your PC but all that goes to waste because no matter you do, game will stutter after some time and it will kill your gaming experience and you will probably become bored with it like me... 
I just don't have anymore desire to play free game knowing that after 20-30 hours invested in game, the experience will be terrible.
Devs please fix something about perfomance, add quests, some variety through the game, not just relying on modders to fix the game for players.

It is a breathtaking game graphics-wise. It has a one noticeable rendering glitch, where multi-segment vehicles will be separated during u-turns but otherwise its is pretty refined. 

It is interesting witnessing transport history unfold. Where dirt roads gave way to highways, and the little village turns into a city. It shows the need for infrastructure, something that I always adore. There always has to be demand. You might not make highways until later on (maybe never), if you don't need them, but you probably will to use trucks to there maximum potential.

60,Transport Fever 2,66695940,english,"After amassing over 150 hours in TF2, I can finally say I'm ready to give a proper review.

Pros:
- Significantly improved performance and memory usage (especially after the last major update)
- Largely similar to TF1, but a lot of small refinements that make the game play better as a whole
- Modular stations add a significant amount of realism and flexibility that was missing in TF1
- Ability to significantly adjust (aka stop) time progression. My one complaint about TF1 was that time moved too fast. It took you sometimes a decade to properly build a line, when in reality (especially the early years) entirely networks were built in the span of a few years.

Cons:
- Railway AI could be improved from TF1. An element of dynamic reaction could be implemented that would greatly improve operations and greatly reduce the need for duplicate tracks in areas. Case in point: two track line with slower freights and faster passenger trains. Freights (if being followed by a passenger) could take a siding and hold for the passenger to pass. Otherwise, the freight would carry on. Or if you have two trains meeting on a single track at a siding, the first train takes the siding and the 2nd one sails through unrestricted, rather than trains in the same direction always taking the siding because of signal placement.
- Signalling could use a significant spruce up. Currently signals display two indications (regardless of the mod): clear and stop. Some mods add a time delay so show yellow, when the signal is really a red stop. And signals do not show routing either, which I feel is an element of animation that would go a long way, especially for systems that so visibly display a routing (thing British Rail semaphore lights). If Locomotion can show this kind of information, surely TF2 could.
- Bridge pier spacing makes no sense. Sometimes they're close, and sometimes they're not. There should be uniform spacing of bridge piers no matter what, with the only time piers go absent is for longer crossings of waterways, for example. We should also have an option for ""no bridge piers"" but the bridges length is severely restricted (basically long enough to go over a road or maybe 3-4 railway tracks). This would be beneficial for overpasses to avoid the  random single pier on the side appearing, or constant collision issues with short bridges.
- Ultimately this feels like a reskin of TF1 with some operational improvements, but those improvements go a long way to avoiding this being a failed second version of a game.

Wish list for next time:
- Two additional categories for trains: Great Britain and Asia. While Europe can cover GB, there's a significant following and a character with railways in Great Britain that is more unique than the whole of Europe, and having a separate category for not only it but Asia as well would help to categorize vehicles better and allow for a specific set of vehicles to more accurately be played in a game (i.e. British vehicles only, rather than everything that's run in Europe).
- More advanced signalling. Even just give us the next two signals (so you can accurately display a green, yellow and red signal) as well as show switch indication if there is a switch within the next X distance ahead of the signal. For the basic game signals, this could mean the top signal is fir the straight route and the bottom signal is for the diverging route. This opens things up immensely to showing a wider variety of signals in the game as produced by the modding community (British colour lights with semaphores, multi-aspect searchlights from North America, etc)
- The ability to yard and store cars in a depot, rather than fixed consists. Say you have a train between points A and B. Sometimes you need to haul less than a full train. So the train would actually leave however many cars at the depot and just run with the full cars, rather than running empty (thus slowing the train down, thus incurring increase operating costs, etc). To do so would mean a yard would need to exist, and this could be nearby the station and cars simply appear or disappear (fade in/out) as they are needed. This could be further expanded to warnings such as ""Train X has been full the last 4 trips. You should make more cars available and expand the trains length"".
- More flexible/realistic/visually appealing truck depots. Simulating trucks having coal or ore dumped into them, rather than magically filling up would be far for appealing. Or for trucks being loaded with goods, have them reverse to a loading dock or a crane lift crates onto the flatbed. While the TF2 truck depot is very flexible, it is visually un-appealing and to be honest, I avoid using trucks because of it.
- More uniform and generic bridge types by default. Still to this day, no one has created the single through or deck girder bridge with either concrete piers or steel trestle towers. These bridges were all over Europe and North America, yet they remain missing in the game. Some styles have come close, but don't capture the flavour.
- Railways in the street. Very common in older towns around the world. Would allow access to industries without the need to demolish entire districts. Could be heavily speed restricted (15 mph-20 km/h) and single track only on wider roads, but very helpful for some. And further to that ...
- Tram Tracks not in the road BY DEFAULT. It shouldn't have to take a custom mod to have tram tracks that aren't in a road. This is how many modellers (including myself) make rapid transit networks in our cities. And, to further that, allow tram tracks to be built within railway stations.

Visually the game looks great and has a great feature of allowing you to have a first person view of any vehicle - Maps can be pretty huge but look quite generic through the random seeds/settings.

The issues though:
- A poor, unintuitive UI that for example wont let you to sell a vehicle from the profitability/management screen - instead you have to open the view on each vehicle or highlight a bunch in the routing screen.
- You have to sell a whole train and rebuy it if you say want to change a single carriage
- really clunky track laying and road placing 
- The campaign has really repetitive ""missions"" that involve you clicking the big hovering question mark in the sky again and again as if doing this was gameplay.
- The clunky rotate and minimum size for stations means you may need to demolish half of a city just to place a one track station
- There are just way more features (like cargo delivery time/pay and competitor AI or multiplayer) in OpenTT and that is free  [Transport Tycoon now 20+ years old too so no excuse for having LESS gameplay than that old game]

In summary:

This is a game for people who want to play with a model train set and admire the beauty of the 5:45 Trans-Pennine Express rather than play a ""game"" as such. The workshop is like 90% people just uploading art assets for their 'special' train or favourite lorry logos etc - if you get a boner over the look of some obscure Canadian freight train this game may be for you.

Save your money though and play OpenTT if you want a 'game' - this is way way overpriced for a 6/10 game.",1587526920,1587527358,FALSE,2,1,0.454545468,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,80,31,1145,0,1076,1589480965

March-2020 - Ever had a train set as a kid, sure u did. Now follow 170 years of transport on land sea and air. As a studio known for train games, the train is still king, but connecting the rail to the road is the route to fantastic wealth. Essentially an re-issue/expansion of TF1, the game looks gorgeous, has a mission based tutorial and has an ever growing workshop but remains a very chill game. Ships and docks remain under developed and still some weird UI decisions, but now recommend. Choo Choo! 

THE REVIEW below is now out of date thankfully, performance issues have largely been dealt with and the game is mostly stable (march 2020) and the devs are posting on the steam discussions page. 

Feb 2020 -The game works for some people for other its unplayable, including me. Loading times can be around an hour then the game plays terribly. There are issues for laptop users and seemingly nvidia owners. There is no support forum and no activity from the devs on the discussions page. CTDs, freezes etc don't seem uncommon. 
AVOID until fixed.

Otherwise the game seems to be an upgrade to tf1 but essentially much the same game. Tis v pretty if it works though.",1576258247,1587149058,FALSE,0,0,0.565217376,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,156,3,12816,0,854,1598379774
74,Transport Fever 2,64379388,english,"It has a few errors in some maps I think they may have fixed some of those but I was being kicked out a lot in Japan campaign randomly until I finally finished it.   Other than that no really any huge bugs in this game other than busy maps like that one. 

The rest of this review is mainly for those who played Transport Fever (1) not 2.

They took away some things that I really liked being able to limit stockpiles and having many types of products between cities is now reduced to simple two.  The developer claim that it makes it more difficult I think it just makes it more boring.  I am not able to do what I want any longer many cities request things that make no sense and many cities request nothing at all. The bigger city may not need anything at all.   

The other issues are some items within maps are confusing to what to do or even work unless done exactly like developers request for example a STAR pattern is made by me yet not done exactly like developers want hence I have to try combos many different ways waiting to finish it.   Also many items such as delivering to TRIBES makes no sense how to do it try building various buildings nothing seemed to work as what developers expected I guess.   Joining the Nazis or Allies makes no difference in any way far as quest seems you just don't get one of achievements if you do one and not the other.  

 I liked the original and besides new city changes with stockpiles the overall rest of the train system is much easier yet they said it would be harder with only two cargo types.   No it's much easier since you got more tracks per node yet less freight types to deal with sometimes zero freight but only passengers.  The advantages in the new one is more trains per node which old one limited you to only few so made choosing what to put on a train or truck more difficult to choose what could be dropped off or loaded.  Now so many trains can be added per node also you can edit the nodes seemly easier than prior since typically dealing with only 2 freight types it's not difficult it's simple to move only two items from a city prior could be many items.  That's another thing that made old one harder to manage freight in old one verses now before I had to disable pickups or drop offs on a node nope not anymore.   I do like that they added more ability with nodes and ability to edit and add more train lanes but simply stating don't like the request from a city to be either 0 or two.

 I already played most of scenarios, I still don't get what the difference is with the different buildings added to the station CARGO / PASSENGER I can see they are bigger but seems I can not make sense of them other than waste of space. There is zero indication what these size differences do in game.  The length of cargo / passenger docks obviously allow more freight but far as Connections to street buildings with small or giant cargo buildings make no difference from my experience.  You think the bigger ones would create more passengers or give more freight space or cause some of the missions for passengers to not mind waiting hence longer but none of that is happening.",1583099593,1587148166,TRUE,3,0,0.522987008,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,175,67,5651,0,5651,1583098966

First, the campaign. They give you the outlines where you have to place your buildings, but the building always have to be connected to the road *before* you place it.

Sometimes the outlines where you have to place your buildings are already occupied by your buildings or infrastructure -- annoying.

With the sandbox... Well, if you try to build the lines with a few hops, Road to Train to Road again or something like that, sometimes the shipment just does not want to go out, no matter what you do.

Still, perfectly happy to give the development team my money, as it's by far the best Transport Tycoon-style game out there at the mo (for fans of the original TT) and the more support they get, the more they're able to improve it in future iterations!
I can easily lose myself both in the detail of the game (which arguably is actually over the top, graphically, for what is required in a transport management game) and the overall immensity of the systems you can create. Definitely worth a try, and top marks also have to be given to the realms of extremely talented mod-creators who have contributed to filling in some of the gaps of the base game  :)

I've enjoy the game so far as I can play it. I experienced a few random crashes whilst playing but now I've hit a barrier and I'm unable to progress the campaign due to regular crashes. Reading the many comments regarding 'crashes' in the Discussion pages, it appears the problem is 'ping-ponging' between application and system causes. My PC meets all (or exceeds) the stated system requirements for TF2 and is capable of playing some heavy duty games without incident. So in summary, a good game but be prepared for random crashes and some frustration due to the instability.

Updated the review after playing around with the graphics settings and finally being able to progress the campaign - if you are still experiencing crashes after the March 2020 update, I suggest lowering your screen resolution and restarting; repeat until stable. The game memory management is such that most rigs will struggle and crash on higher settings.

First the positives:
+ it is a great transport game, in my opinion the best out there at the moment
+ the best features of TF1 are still here, especially mods
+ a lot of annoying mechanics from TF1 were upgraded, like station upgrades and multiple vehicle upgrades
+ graphics were improved visibly
+ new Asian environment with own vehicles is a plus
+ you don't have to deliver every product to every city, hallelujah!
Now the negatives:
- it's not that big of an upgrade, feels more like TF1 DLC than stand-alone game
- apart from new region number of new vehicles is disappointing
- industry was simplified, not what I expected
- maps are still too small to make late fast trains and airplanes resonable in most cases

It would definitely be hard to find a more pleasing game in terms of both its appearance and game play, just boarding any vehicle, being either truck, train, boat or aircraft provides such a realistic journey, one that any game would find it hard to surpass. The game play is solid and the campaign is excellent although I did get stuck on the 13th mission (Japan high speed loco's) and so moved onto the free play element which also provides a really good challenge. If there is one criticism I would make it would be that there could be a few more different types of product on the map to move around and that towns maybe required more than just the two items (excluding passengers) to satisfy their demand.

I find myself switching constantly between just looking at my lines working like a clockwork, establishing new lines and optimizing old ones.

I stopped rather frustrated a while ago because the performance was getting worse (especially in train station configuration) and existing lines where cumbersome to manage. Luckily this changed with the latest updates by improving performance and providing some usability features like editing existing trains (just to name one usefull feature).

The campaign on the other hand was well narrated and fun for the first few missions but became quite repetitive fast. Many mission targets also took just too long to complete. I would wish for some scenarios where existing networks have to be optimized to remove congestion/improve efficiency or reducing pollution in a city to a certain minimum without cutting the ressource supply.

I like that it's real-time, like a Paradox game, you can get on with stuff and the world will move on, so you always seem busy with something.

But:

After having played Anno 1800, I really appreciate being able to zoom in and see interactions going on between different objects in the game, and a really well drawn and animated world of people. This doesn't do it anywhere near as well, but there is a certain satisfaction from watching vehicles moving around.

EDIT

I've also discovered playing this game is like JAVA PROGRAMMING 10 years ago! So infuriating when you click ""execute"" and nothing happens.

I really want to give this game a thumbs up but there is too many bugs (Some of which were in the PREVIOUS game) and this game feels like a graphics upgrade when compared to the past games . Only major new things are a crappy map editor and a mediocre campaign.

Will reconsider my thumbs down if the bugs get fixed up.

If a few more bugs get fixed and fps made a little better I will move to a thumbs up.",1578508470,1585084495,FALSE,6,2,0.518401027,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,42,3,11364,0,3569,1596153834

25,Transport Fever 2,64721979,english,"I'm a Transport Fever 2 convert. The game has gotten much better and continues to improve. I used to be addicted to Railroad Tycoon 3 and I was sorely disappointed with Train Fever.  This game is fascinating and is certainly enjoyable to play but still has a way to go. 

Railroad Tycoon 3 was getting a bit ""long in the tooth"" and I was hoping for an upgrade.

Transport Fever 2 is  pretty; prettier even than Transport Fever 1.  In the main screen both are far superior to Railroad Tycoon 3  in terms of prettiness but there are some functional aspects that Railroad Tycoon 3 still does better. 

Transport Fever 2 uses signals which were not a feature in Railroad Tycoon 3 and they are an improvement. Unfortunately water towers and fueling (maintenance) sheds are absent from Transport Fever and would make for a more interesting game. Growing up in a railroad town spoiled me but I'd also expect a turntable.

Transport Fever & Transport Fever 2 requires returning empty freight cars for re-use (although they seem outrageously priced). I criticized Train Fever when coal hoppers and iron hoppers weren't interchangeable and for the most part that sort of issue is fixed in Transport Fever and Transport Fever 2

Railroad Tycoon 3 had a robust economic simulation game with 30+ commodities in 1, 2, and 3 deep production chains. Transport Fever & Transport Fever 2  has maybe a dozen commodities. and they've limited TF 2 to requiring only two commodities in each city. It would have seemed more realistic (and NOT all that tough to program) for all basic commodities to be required by all cities and for growing towns to require more advanced commodities. They also missed the chance to just allow for a falling rate of return on transporting ""glutted commodities."" 

Railroad Tycoon 3 had the ability to buy stock in your company and learn about the benefits (and dangers) of margin buying - an opportunity completely missed  in Train Fever & Train Fevers 1&2.

Transport Fever 2 (as of the last update) is finally getting the cost of laying, bulldozing and re-laying track right. 

Railroad Tycoon 3 had 66 Historical Locomotives rather than the 45 offered in Train Fever. But with Modders able to create and share these things in the workshop that's not really an issue anymore.

Railroad Tycoon 3 had debt (by issuing 500,000 in bonds) that changed as to rates making refinancing something that needed to be contemplated. Transport Fever and Transport Fever 2 are more simplistic with NO bond market and the ability to borrow from the bank (at a fixed 1%)  They DID fix Transport Fever 2 to charge interest monthly rather than only once a year; a bug/exploit which allowed for folks to borrow funds and then repay them to avoid a year's interest. 

Railroad Tycoon 3 had AI Competitors that sometimes required that you buy them out in certain scenarios. There are NO AI competitors in Transport Fever. [b]Making this a multi-player game would certainly solve that. [/b]

Railroad Tycoon 3 had AI Competitors based on real world people who played roles in the development of the Railroads. You got a bit of history with your gaming. That's missing here. 

Railroad Tycoon 3 had economic cycles that affect supply and demand. Nothing like it exists in Train Fever 2.

Railroad Tycoon 3 had 20+ MANDATORY scenarios that really encouraged you to explore the intricacies of the game . Transport Fever & Transport Fever 2 have OPTIONAL Campaigns that sort of serve this function or you can elect to play in  sandbox mode.

Railroad Tycoon 3 had overview maps that made spotting industries and resources (and the demand for them) much clearer than anything offered in the ""Fever"" games. In fact it's pretty much impossible to zoom ""all the way out"" on any large (or bigger maps)  There's also no mini-map to aid in navigation. 

Railroad Tycoon 3 had well laid out Train lists that show at-a-glance status information that you cannot see as easily in the ""TF"" games. The Transport Fever Vehicles list HAS gotten much better than it was in the original Train fever game and keeps getting better so I'm hopeful. 

Transport Fever & Transport Fever 2 is a great game. I just wish that the developers paid more attention to what had gone before and incorporated some of the ""things that worked"" into their game design. Every time I play I'm reminded that it could have been so much MORE than it is. 

[h1]Checklist of original complaints[/h1]

When I reviewed the Original Train fever I posted a list of things that they could have done that would have gotten them a better review. Here's an update on that list:

1) Track laying - Same day undo - allow any track laid to be demolished (on the same day) at no cost. This would somewhat make up for the lack of a real in-game track planning mode. Done! 

2) Enable ESC as a means of bringing up the main loading menu. The current method wastes time and screen real estate. 
Done! 

3) Make it easier to reload a saved game. I'm not sure whether this has been fixed in Transport fever but it required actually quitting and restarting the the game in Train Fever. Done! 

4) Options should also be available via the escape menu. If one wishes to turn off the game sounds or something similar one has to quit Train Fever. Why was music the only one that can be silenced in-game? 
Done! 

5) If you're going to do windows DO WINDOWS. Windows should be resizeable. Scrollable left and right as well as up and down. Cut and paste renaming should be enabled as well. Allowing for longer names would be good too. Default names suggested based on terminals would be great. 
Partly done - Most windows are now resizeable & scrollable (Though not left & right) Things ARE renameable but no cut & paste

6) Put a confirm on save game deletes. It was far too easy in Train Fever to delete the latest save game if one generally deletes a few saved games at start up time. 
Done

7) As with any simulator with economic aspects, graphs would be nice. Or even improved statistics on trains. 5 and 10 year running averages of revenue expenses profits, passengers. The graphs are now there but no multi-year running averages and there is PLENTY of room for improvement in what is graphed. 

8) Signals are important in this game. They should be easier to see whether zoomed in or out. 
That's still problematic and holds true for pretty much ALL icons. None are scaleable though they can be turned on or off. 

9) The Manage lines window should be sortable on Time, et. al. 
Done!

10) Station list should be sortable on cargo 
Done, sorta.

11) A button for next on line or next should be available in the vehicle details window 
Still not done

12) The Mouse zoom feature should be more granular (more interim steps) 
Done!

14) A Trainopedia feature would be great. 
Done! 

15) Towns list should show Goods needs supply and a few more details that are now only viewable in the city windows 
Still not done

16) Commodities should be easier to see on a fully zoomed out map. 
Still an issue

17) If this game were look more like Railroad Tycoon III as to GUI features, it would be great. The GUI is getting better.

[h1]Wishlist for Transport Fever 3 (or any update really)[/h1]
1) Change the word Supply in Town Screens to Demand
2) Change the word Transport to Delivered in the Industry details window
3) Start New Freeplay games on Pause. - One needs to study a map before doing any building. Every time I start a new game I remember this only after noticing.
4) Change the Display of Income to NOT include Investments - Use the term Net Cash Flow for the total with Investments subtracted.
5) Allow some customization in ""Ride along"" view and/or add Date Cargo Profits for this vehicle
6) Coal, Iron, Fuel, Bread icons all look too similar to other icons. They should be rethought and/or allow user to choose size of icons
7) Remove the cost of maintaining waypoint markers they are often used to correct AI pathing ""errors.""

I originally wasn't super impressed with this game. It has a bit of a learning curve if you have played other management games but not TF. I'll probably write more as I get more time in. Overall, it's a lot of fun. Naturally, trains are my favorite part. Setting up a big system of raw products, refined products, and final delivery to consumers and watch it all start to work is a lot of fun. The trains can bit a bit of a learning curve. I came from Factorio, and I'm used to my strategy of one way trains only. This game doesn't have that option. I mean, you could, but it's not really set up to be like that. So getting used to having one way in and out stations connected to a main train takes a little practice, but once you get the basics down of how to signal to control the trains, it's super fun. Basically what I do is I normally run 2 land tracks everywhere with signals every so often so the trains can run closer together (signals form a block that a train will not enter if there is already another train in there). I'll typically connect inline stations to these, ensuring there is always a bypass option for trains not stopping there. Before and after every station or terminus I do a crisscross system so that every platform has access to both directions of the track. Signal the entry from the main track to splitter. The trains are smart enough to know if they can get to their platform even if there is another train on a different one within your signal area. So you get a lot of cool automatic action with very simple signal work. Definitely worth a shot.",1576646962,1584808390,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,97,12,3467,3,520,1602076941

1: in nr 1 it was possible to choose the specific cargo in wagons, now it is auto - which means sometimes trains decide to drag resources from a factory back to a supplier for some reason.

2: whenever you are configuring the modular stations, the game lags like crazy and if you started in 1850 on a big map, you have to change each friggin' component of each friggin' passenger station to more modern versions... while the game is lagging! 
I had a 16 track station, which by the way to make, you have to basically rebuild the entire station... Because the devs made the basic stations off center by 1 tile, which means if you just go from a max 8track station or whatever station, and  try and make a max size, you will end up with 2 tracks on the sides where 1 has no platform. So if you are planning on making a max station, build a 1 track 80m one, and just start from scratch by finding a corner of the area.... 
took me 1hr just to build a station for 16 tracks in 1850... then it became 1980 and the fancy modern stations became available...

Nope! I quit! I am not spending an hour upgrading 1 station, only to know I have 16 more to go...

Also the Animation and the Love for little Details are impressive. The new Towns rock and its great Fun building your own little World and improving on your 1850 Railways. // They fixed the Performance and it seems that its now worth to recommend. Runs smoother as Tpf1 now on my Machine and even at a insane Amount of Traffic i did not see any Problems, tho i upgraded my HDD to a SDD and Ram from 8 to 16. Anyway it runs better now

Well its a nice Game and all, has good new Features and when it runs for a while it gets really addicting BUT the Performance is so bad....i have Specs well above Minium Specs and Recommended Specs are not even shown on my Store Page. Zooming in, kicks you on Desktop and back, Rotating the Camera does the same. Moving quickly the same. Alt+Tabbing too much gets the Game stuck so you have to force it to close. Its beatiful but not that beautiful. It keeps stuttering, microlags, random kicks to the Desktop and being laggy. 

Currently i recommend everyone that wants to play this Game, to wait. Without any Performance Patches its never gonna be Fun at all. Making it just frustrating and depressing building a huge Station just to get crashed before a Autosave.

Finished the campaigns
What was interesting quickly became a bit mundane. then my own goal to pause, pre-plan every thing, then hit start time. It was interesting to watch missions pop up and close very quickly. But that's done and isn't a repeatably part of the game.

Off to Free play
Plain vanilla, to start on the STEAM Achievements. In a few hours of play, over 50% are earned. A few others I could snag by cheesie play with lame stunts to buy, change time, and race to complete them. Not earned in my book, but hey, you do you sunshine.

CTD
And this is why the review is not a good one.
On a top of the line PC less then a month old, plain vanilla, no mods, basic campaign and basic free play maps, CTD's are a normal occurrence. Autosave is your friend, and also a contributor to some CTD's.

Dev's pushed on an update, and yet CTD's still happen.
This isn't some indie project in a basement with the entire family finances on the line.
This is a major sequel to a major game.

And it crashes like I wrote it.

How much worse is it going to get before it gets better?

A second new fever is in the works, it's called Transport Fever 2!

Not really... 

Transport Fever 2 is a sequel to the first game developed by Urban Games and published by Good Shepherd Entertainment and it's mostly like the classic Transport Tycoon Deluxe and OpenTTD, only... it's not as good

Transport Fever 2 is a fun game to play, although I don't know why they just called it Transport Fever 2 as you can also add buses and trams but anyway, however, the game is very clunky and sometimes annoying.

Another thing which bugged me was the level of difficulty. The game is not easy and you would end up bankrupt immediately if not selective. Of course I understand that the game has to have some challenge but you can fail instantly if you muck up something

When placing the train tracks especially, the game's framerate chugs like hell, so much so, I have to stop and wait for the game to regain the framerates to make it even playable. Also, the game freezed for a couple of seconds to autosave which can be annoying

However, the game does have a fantastic level amount of detail. From the trains, to the house, people and cars and landscape, this also includes the sound effects, especially the train sound effects. The music on the other hand, isn't that great

Transport Fever 2 is a mixed bag when it comes to purchasing, I am in the middle when it comes to recommending it or not. I highly suggest that for this game you check out some reviews and gameplay videos before considering purchasing, but overall, Transport Fever 2 isn't that bad!

[h1] RECOMMENDED :) [/h1]

multiplayer mode - like a versus to see who can get the most money in a specific time

like a regions mode so you can move between maps and keep the money so the game could feel more expansive right now it feels compacked and not a lot of free space to operate

this game is great. problem is: most of the side missions are plain stupid or wtf? the game would be better without them! for a completionist like me, a nightmare.
second, there are a lot uf useful functions hidden within the game, for example the ability to tell your vehicle exactly how long to wait for how much cargo. this would be usefull early on, instead having your trains and trucks aimlessly driving around the landscape and waisting valuable time. 
all you have to keep in mind is: the game will automatically deliver all necesary goods to where they are needed - as long as your routes (can be from trucks to train to trucks again) are closed and your vehicles are cabeable of transporing them - keep this in mind, because if something doesn't seem to work, it's almost always one of those points ;-) trust me with this!

Dieses Spiel ist eigentlich toll. Die Nebenmissionen können einem jedoch echt den Nerv ziehen und laufen auf ""Trial and Error"" hinaus, weil selten klar ist, was eigentlich zu tun ist - oder sie sind einfach banal. Das Spiel wäre besser ohne sie! Auch werden einem viele nützliche Funktionen, speziell zur exakten Tour- und Zeitplanung  eurer Routen, welche einem das Leben schon im ersten Kapitel erleichtern könnten, nie wirklich erklärt - oder vom ersten Teil vorausgesetzt!? 
Alles was ihr wissen müsst, um den größten Stolperstein im Spiel zu vermeiden: das Spiel wird alles was irgendwo verfügbar ist und irgendwo anders gebraucht wird automatisch auch dorthin bringen - SOLANGE ihr einen geschlossenen Transportweg dorthin habt (kann z.B. LKW-Zug-LKW sein) UND(!) eure Fahrzeuge auch in der Lage sind, besagte Güter auch zu transportieren. Ihr könnt mir vertrauen: falls eure Güter nicht transportiert werden, solltet ihr ganz genau diese Punkte checken! In 90% der Fälle ist das Problem dadurch gelöst ;-)

However, as my cities got larger, and my transportation networks satisfyingly grew, I was starting to get a little tired of (zoning, add fire, police, school, medical, garbage, mortuary, power, water) just to keep the fun part (transportation) growing. 

When I first tried Transport Fever 2, I went for the campaign as I felt it would be a good place to learn the game as the campaign has a built in tutorial. However, starting off in the 1850's and using really small maps, I was underwhelmed and was ready to give up on the game. 

I decided to give it one more try using one of the randomly generated maps. That's when I realized the maps can get REALLY LARGE!

There are a lot more things there just feel this game is unfinished.

DONT GET THE GOOD RATINGS ITS GETING.

BE CAREFUL, before u buy...

there is ofc the optimization which is not good but so far my spec are much above but still see lags in later game.

I've already put over 30 hours into it just within the past few days. 

Pros: 
   - Easy UI
   - Big maps
   - Very customizable
   - Great graphics and camera movements
   - Choose between campaign or sandbox mode
   - Balanced economy (Income/Expenditures)
   - Great modding community
   - Track-laying is intuitive and simple
   - The Cities grow as you supply them! 
   - There is always something to do or improve 
   - I love making millions of $

Cons
   - Airports are not very customizable (Maybe I didn't get far enough yet), but I wish I could edit the runway length, add another runway/taxiways, etc. 
   - The in-game music is sh$t, I usually just turn it off and play my own background music
   - Airplanes approaching need a little more realistic landing approach, ex: there are trees at the beginning of the runway they can fly through them. Runway hazards are the a big topic in aviation, so airplanes in this game need to take into consideration any obstacles like trees, buildings, etc. when landing and fly over them, making their landing distance longer. The player needs to recognize these dangers and remove tress, or extend runway length. 
   - Adding to the approach, airplanes shouldn't be landing halfway down the runway, they land near the beginning of the runway, especially on shorter runways like in this game. 
   - The cars travelling on multi-lane highways don't have very smart AI when it comes to switching lanes, they will stay stuck behind slower vehicles and create a huge lines even though the other lanes are wide open. Switching lanes shouldn't take driving around the block. Vehicles should move a little more freely around the roads, maybe even throw in some drunk drivers and emergency vehicles. The world ain't perfect. 

In conclusion, absolutely an amazing game, if you like these types of games you will love this one!

I dont know how it is for anyone else, but my game crashes randomly and frequently so I have it autosave every 5 minutes.

55,Transport Fever 2,63504068,english,"My first foray into business simulation games started with Transport Tycoon. I fell in love with it as a child, and I've been addicted to this genre of games ever since. I occasionally play the rewritten implementation of it - OpenTTD - to this day. When I saw there was finally a game studio that wanted to take on the challenge of making a transport focused business simulation game I was very excited. I couldn't wait for it to be released.

I felt the same about this game when it was announced. I pre-ordered it thinking there would be no way I wouldn't like it. And technically, I do like it. I could forgive the shortcomings the original Transport Fever had, given that it was the studio's first game that included all types of transport. There was nothing else like it for me to compare it against, other than maybe the (at the time?) shallow transportation mechanics in Cities:Skylines. When I first launched this game it felt very familiar, maybe too familiar.

I jumped into the campaign with no expectations, and I'm sad to say that I came out disappointed. I didn't play past the second mission of the second campaign; it wasn't engaging, and the pretentious narrator had me pulling my hair out. With all due respect, narrator, but I know that 50 metres of track I just laid is not exceptional in any way regardless of what you tell me. 

During the campaign, you're constantly being held by your hand and the game tells you what you can and cannot do; for instance, you may not build a train that is longer than what is required by the mission, and any shorter will not complete it. You may not extend an existing station which would allow you to build a train that could complete the mission in 1 trip, you have to do it in 2 trips. The game is not rewarding you for exploiting the game's mechanics or for being clever. Besides that, some of the missions are incredibly vague which left me clicking and zooming around just to see if I had missed something.

After that wild ride, I jumped into a free game; the meat and potatoes of the game. I played with the European set and a tempered landscape, and later I tried a game with the Asian set on a tropical island. The tropical island didn't offer anything different from the tempered landscape, so in the end I didn't even bother with it.

Apart from the UI, it's apparent that a lot of the game's content had been copied from Transport Fever. The engines are mostly the same, the cars are mostly the same, the tracks are the same, the roads are mostly the same, the way you lay tracks and roads is the same (albeit with less ""slope too steep"" warnings), the way operating costs are calculated; you guessed it, the same. I'm particularly irked by the fact that they did basically nothing to improve roads. Not even the rule sets were changed. Highways still have sidewalks (why... why...?). Still no way to put highways parallel to each other without mods. The game does look better, but in terms of features, assets (ignoring the details) and the tools that you use, it's basically the same.

The economy isn't very interesting. I don't remember what it was like in the original game, but it seems like there is no reward for delivering goods or passengers faster, so it usually boils down to buying the cheapest and slowest engines and cars you can find (because of how the operating costs are calculated). They could have added cool features like random events where your company gets a subsidy for using a certain engine or certain route. Factory growth is artificially limited rather than being limited from not being able to physically grow, for example. Let the demand or lack of resources be the reason why a factory can't grow any further. There's so many things that spring to mind when thinking about what they could have done with the economy.

Ohh the UI. I've made a whole forum post detailing what I would change to make it less cumbersome to use. Too many tabs; too many duplicate information windows; too large; not obvious what even is and what isn't a window; weird and confusing button placement; you have to click around so much to get things done; still making use of useless bar charts.. the list goes on. It's usable, but it's annoying to use. I do believe they added a way to build prebuilt structures though, so that's nice.

Performance is better than the original game. I still drop to 30 fps or lower when zooming into cities, and from what I can tell the cities are smaller (or at least harder to grow) than in the original game, but they (and the lands around them) look nicer; you win some, you lose some. I do get the occasional crash when I zoom into a city or try to upgrade something attached to one.

Sound design is nothing special, it doesn't stand out as good or bad. Except for maybe, the diesel trains which are pretty good and the airplanes also sound cool.

There are still new things to be discovered and things to like: I do believe the developers said they added more detail to things. There's some new road vehicles. There's new aircraft. There's new vehicles from the new Asian set. A very nice addition compared to the old game are the modular stations. They feel fleshed out and they work intuitively, and they work for every transport type. I love the aircraft in this game, you can't help but smile when you see one take off. There's a bunch of animals around that you can click and even go first person on, which is cute. Some of the overlays are pretty useful. And in the end, there is mod support, which will make sure there will be more than enough content and tools that will make people's lives easier. 

To conclude, I feel like the developers didn't learn much about who buys their game and what their needs are. Maybe they did, but they couldn't work things out internally, or they figured the people who mod their games will sort out their problems. In any case, for returning players, I can't recommend this game unless you *really* want what are essentially quality of life improvements, some new vehicles (of which you probably had more already because of mods), and a more visually pleasing world. This is basically Transport Fever 1.5 rather than 2. For new players, I can wholeheartedly recommend this game, because those players won't know that this game could have been much more.",1581708303,1581708303,FALSE,217,11,0.81179136,19,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,193,3,1460,0,1422,1581709399

Many games have tried to live up to OPENTTD in the last 20+ years and all of them have failed for one reason or another. Even this game's predecessor had serious problems that stopped it being the new standard - excessive difficulty, a clunky interface and a vague and confusing economy system that didn't give you enough information to make decisions. But those are fixed here, and as such if you like moving stuff around a sandboxy map and making money, this is finally the game you've been waiting for. The difficulty settings are flexible enough that you can use it as everything from a tough business sim to just a giant model trainset with pretty graphics and nice sound. The interface is much improved since the first game (although it's still not perfect, especially when you have a lot of lines to manage), but improving the interface seems to be a priority from the devs in recent updates and a lot of the initial confusing/weird things have been fixed.

I am the first to admit that whilst I love this game to death it's very niche and not for everyone. There are some downsides that mean it might not be your taste. No multiplayer or AI opponents, some people have reported optimisation/performance problems (I only get issues on the experimental map sizes, especially after the last patch but ymmv), a lot of TPF1 diehards don't like the simplification of the economy system, the vanilla selection of vehicles is a bit odd/limited (in the Europe setting you get a locomotive that can go 90mph in about 1930 but you only get coaches that can go 90mph in 1981!), but this and some of the other problems have been fixed by mods.

And aside from the scenarios, there is no point in playing TF2 over TF1. The few UI changes are not all good, especially the idea that you manage the same line through two different windows, which is such an elementary level of design screwup that I am confused how this is a company that makes games.

As an added bonus, the early scenarios are kind of insane: play as a Dutch governor of a Caribbean island, an American government-issued dominator of the West and enjoy the narrator explaining to you how the natives are too stupid to understand work, or play through another scenario where you are implementing a ""socialist experiment"" until the end where the game tells you ""oops! haha! socialism never works!"" and you literally have to bulldoze all of your tracks and buildings as a lesson.

25,Transport Fever 2,63052076,english,"A really great game for transportation simulation players.

+ Separation of industrial and public transport
+ Steam Workshop integration is seamless
+ Modularity approach for station design is really useful
+ Modularity approach of railroads makes laying track a lot more flexible
+ Campaign mode is lengthy (~50 hours) and based on real historical events
+ Free mode allows you to play procedurally generated worlds, technically unlimited maps to play with
+ Different means of transportation with its unique pros and cons
+ Separation of regular trains and high-speed trains
+ Three different types of regions (USA, Europe and Europe) with different terrain characteristics
+ Different models of real train based on the type of region
+ Models of different vehicles will change its look as it deteriorates

- Poor optimization, not utilizing all the CPU cores
- Very few vehicles to buy after the present time (so far I have only unlocked one)
- In the campaign mode, you need to manually save each map to save its progress. 
--> Explanation: Each save you made in the campaign mode only saves the progress of the map you are playing now. If you forget to manually save a map and move onto another map, you will lose all the progress of the unsaved maps. My original intuition is one save will save the progress of all the maps of the campaign mode so I just save all my progress in one save. Now I need to start from scratch to earn all the medals for each map.
- Some people complain that the game is too easy, although I think it is reasonable
- Minor rant: You can only lay down one track at a time and it is kind of annoying to build 2 railroads for each direction

The limitation of goods to cities of only 2 per, feels clunky, unrealistic and unpleasant. I had hoped for a larger diversity of goods for each city so you could build more intricate networks of delivery, but now, the only thing one has to think about is getting the 2nd factory up, for each of the goods, for a city when it has grown over 900 population. 
I am also not liking the ""maintenance"" system that is in place for vehicles.  I personally am not liking the idea of making things more expensive to run, but be able to run them till the end of times.

Should have a change to ""Lorry Fever 2"" since a lot of the time and especially on higher difficulty starting with an intricate network of trains and even a simple one will not work, the maintenance fees for buildings and tracks will run you into the ground.

48,Transport Fever 2,59696623,english,"This game in his current state at day one release is definitely a disappointment if you are an old fan of the serie. However, with mods and a bit of refinement by the Devs, I'm confident enough that it will improve over time.

You would expect that the Devs would have known better at this point, after two other games of the same kind (but this is more the same game that has got improvements than a completely new one), but no, they managed not only to bring over into this several flaws and missing features  that already afflicted the previous two games, like the lacking of a proper planning tool to build the tracks (that almost all the other similar games have), but they also were able to worsen the UI and the economy, and to suppress some of the features that already were in TPF 1.

However, the MAP EDITOR is great and almost makes up for all the flaws.

______________________________________________________

CONS 1:
 (flaws that were already in the previous games)
______________________________________________________

- a proper tracks planning tool is still missing, so that building tracks is still made by ""trial and error"", and can be very frustrating.

- a game minimap is still missing too, despite players requesting it for years (since the previous games of the serie) and despite being a very useful feature and quite easy to implement. The most frustrating thing is that you can't even zoom out enough to see the whole map in game, so really there is actually no way to see the whole map that you are playing.

- there isn't any official game manual, not even in digital form. I guess that newcomers will have to rely on players guides when they will come out.

- the ships and planes economy seems to be the same of the previous game, that was really not focused on them, but more on trains and trucks. So you'll have an hard time to make any profit with them, ships particularly.

______________________________________________________

CONS 2:
(missin or flawed features that were present or were better implemented in TPF1)
______________________________________________________

- the game is incredibly more easy than TPF1 was, even at hard level, because they removed the raising maintenance costs for old vehicles, halved the loan interests, and also dumbed down the freight economy, so that now it's not required anymore to complete a production chain before the cargo becomes available,and  you can simply tranport cargo from an idnustry to another and earn a lot of money. My suspicion is that they wanted to appeal more to casual players, but veteran players are not happy with the current lack of challenge.

-  you can't use anymore drag&drop to change train compositions in a depot. It's still possible to change train consists, but it's clunkier, less intuitive and more time consuming than it was in TPF1.

- the very useful curved, sloped and underground stations are now missing

- The new UI is clunky, cumbersome and confusing. It's true that I'm still new to it, and you need a bit of time to adapt to the changes, but if all the vehicles micromanagement needs a lot more clicking than it did in the previous game, and it's exactly the case here, this is a big red flag for me. 

- The economy also seems definitely off. Dumbed down products chains and raised difficulty by making tracks maintenance cost a lot more only makes for an unfunny cocktail if you love to build freight train lines.

-Vehicular traffic is already insane in 1850 and can't be changed in options (however it can be changed if you mess around with config files).

-The new maintenance system is bad. It has been designed poorly and implemented even worse. They removed the useful and realistic increase of the maintenance costs for old vehicles, that made sense and worked, especially with the useful vehicles autoreplacement option. But what they introduced is a new system where you can raise the maintenance level to very high and the vehicles will become brand new again after some months (it will cost you so much that almost all routes won't remain profitable during the time that you set this maintenance increase). What a pity that this system doesn't work at all. 1) The vehicles become as new again but their value is near zero, so you can't sell them. 2) You can still replace them instead of raising their maintenance, but it's a nightmare if you have a big fleet, because they removed the automatic replacement option, and they also removed the ""memory"" of the last vehicle/train that you have built, so you have to redo it again every time for every single line. But the most weird thing is that the only consequence for not caring of old vehicles at all is that their emissions will increase a bit, slightly affecting the towns population. Basically, the new emissions dynamics is pretty broken too, so you can safely ignore both maintenance and emissions, and your vehicles will continue to make money, with the only caveat of some annoying popups that  from time to time will inform you about how old and crappy your vehicles are.  

-The campaign first 4 or 5 missions are boring and repetitive for expert players,they're more tutorials for new players than challenging missions. But even if the following missions then become more fun, they are ridded with bugs and generally they are extremely easy and not challenging.

-There are very few bridges to chose from and with very limited speeds, They removed all the old wooden and iron bridges from the game (they are now available again thanks to modders porting them from TPF1).
______________________________________________________

PROS:
______________________________________________________

- The visual aspect of the game is generally very pleasant and improved from the previous game.

- There are some new interesting vehicle models.

- Finally they separated the game time from the game date, great idea, so you can now set it to run as before, with the years passing by, or you can simply remain to play in a particular year and enjoy the vintage vehicles as long as you want, or a combination of both.

- They seem to have improved a lot the terraforming part, so you finally got rid of that annoying ""collisions"" messages that were constantly bothering you in the previous games.

- The game is more modder friendly than ever, so I expect it that it will improve a lot over time, when the mods will flock to workshop (however there are some core mechanics that can't be changed with mods, and the Devs will have to do it).

- To be fair, there is a really big improvement from TPF1, that makes up almost completely for all the missing features, and it's the map editor. It's really great, albeit not so user friendly. Also, the terrain editing tools in the editor could benefit from more radiius than the maximum one they have at the moment, that is frankly too small to edit fastly a big map.",1576127396,1580810829,FALSE,5,0,0.56349206,4,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,135,28,32976,1,708,1601200388

- Path-finding seems better too

Cons:
- Mega maps are very memory hungry
- Only 2 difficulty levels which just adjust cost (hard is not hard enough, just like TF1)
- Very limited number of stock vehicles, which forces you to go through the workshop and search and find

Couple of other changes, such as consumer and industry demands (1 of each per city), vehicle maintenance and replacement and some adjusted supply chains (fuel and food most notably).

The bonus missions in the campaign are a complete waste of time in the current format. I'd recommend googling them instead of trying to work out what bizarre thing the developer is trying to make you do.

61,Transport Fever 2,61375482,english,"Update: 2/3/2020

[i]Well - It's been a while since the original review below was written. Been playing TF2 off and on since day 1 of release now. I just can't put my thumb on what's wrong but there's something very wrong and very different about TF2 from TF1. TF1 was/is fun to play. TF2 isn't fun at all. 30 minutes into a play session and I'm at a point where I'm throwing my hands up in the air and thinking to myself - well - that's 30 minutes I'll never get back.

Why isn't TF2 fun and TF1 was/is fun? Wish I knew but for me that's the case. Sad - TF has so much unrealized potential.[/i]

1. TF2 is essentially an upgrade not a whole new game. Some things like freight, for example, have changed some like it better than TF1 (like me) and some don't.
2. IMO the game was built on a premise that everyone has a very fast CPU because TF2 is CPU limited. Users with the latest and greatest and fastest GPU's available are seeing FPS numbers down in the dirt if they have CPU's older than for example an i7- six or seven thousand series.

If TF2 gets optimized graphically to a much greater extent (and it doesn't take a year like it did with TF1) and the devs figure out how to optimize the CPU load to take advantage of multiple cores (which it currently doesn't do very well - NOTE: the fanbois really freak out over this making excuses and being apologists for the TF devs) and that doesn't take a year I will come back and change this to a solid recommended.

The major improvement is graphics at all levels even if you play at LOW so you laptop/pc copes. Great to see improvement on shipping and air transport both of which I use alot in TF1. The mods coming in cover up some holes there so you can use some of the short range aircraft on small airports too  which is what they were designed for (NOT ONLY large airports note devs ie Avrojet and  Bombadier Q8). We  could do with some really short haul aircraft like the Twin Otter and BN Islander  with 5 to 5 pass and my biggest gripe still no Civil Helecopters with Helepad!  Please work on that devs. As for Shipping wonderful except still no Ferries  cars ot trains can load onto.  This game is a long haul game so I play it over weeks at slowest speed as I love to see it grow. For New Players start with the simplest and cheapest  either a passenger route (1 train 4/5 coaches expand to another set if route goes well) on flat land between  3 towns with bus routes in those towns and wait or go the goods  route connect as a Farm to Food Production factory and then a  nearby town using any mod eof transport you can afford to start and let the town and your finances grow, Then slowly expand but always have 1 million in reserve. If you get through the first 10 years and use money wisely you are there. Do not do any expensive project until you reach 20m: ie tunnels , bridges and damn expensive trains until you are sure the investment will pay off.

Negatives outweigh those by a tonne. UI isnt as good as the first game, not being able to send goods to any town is a big no in my book, AI decisions are bordering on stupid just to name a few.

Game developers need to realise we want freedom and choice in a game not to be given limitations or being told what can and cannot go where, first game didnt do it so why on earth do you think we would want it in this one? stop fixing things that arent broke, if you have no ideas that improve the game rather than hinder the player and take away from the fun, either dont make a sequel until you do, or make the same game with better graphics and less bugs.

89,Transport Fever 2,62687963,english,"Great game, however, after spending 20+ hours on one map, going from 1850's to 2010+, building pretty much everything, there is a massive lack off content late-game. Best example being Bullet trains/Shinkansen, there is only one, and its a fixed train, no customization to it. And the highspeed track (300km/h), is there but no train that can really utilize it fully, not even the _only_ Shinkansen in the game that only reaches 220km/h. Now, it's not only a ""train"" game I get that, you have access to all types of transport, but even the other types lack diversity late game.

There is also a severe lack of options for prioritization and min/maxing in the goods chains, it works, but it's a really dumb system, which also shows when you try and deliver goods to their final destinations in the cities. You can't really make ""effective"" routes for goods, you have to spam and make what could only be described as ""Cluster F**ks"" of serveral routes all over the city.

Speaking of the cities, they only have 2 ""needs"" and allways will, which lowers the challenge of the game overall, would really have liked to see that after a while, they would require a 3rd or even a 4th.
It's also (as a side note) annoying that you can really focus on one town and after a few in-game years, you notice that other town's which you have not interacted with at all, grows more then the city you actually are working on.

The game is a sidestep, it has some graphical improvements, changes to industry  and some nice features, but its all too little and overshadowed by non intuitive user interface/experience, lack of information when you need it, terrible mid game performance that is worse than the previous titles (which also suffer badly from performance)

The simplification  of industry (although I have modded that) was a let down, a more complex industry chain is needed, not a simplified one, even compared to the prior titles.

The dev's are also fairly quiet which is strange, the game is still in its infancy, you would expect a lot more comms, but nope, silent other than a few patch notes which are generally posted by users in the beta branch before the dev's (and by that I mean days before, not 5 mins)

They are bolting stuff on to their engine, without fixing the fundamental issues that already exist.  Performance / Long pauses / Lagging and User experience / UI have been common complaints since Train fever and they still exist today!

I run a 9900k, 2080ti, NVME SSD and 32gb ram, yet I also get 30 second pauses when building/modifying anything or even just smoothing the terrain.

The system in place that automatically determines which commodity goes where is good and easy to use, but it takes away some of the gameplay that is fun to do in this kind of game.

33,Transport Fever 2,62368338,english,"TL;DR - yeah, get it. Use mods to enhance everything, it's fire.

Now listen, you can sit here and tell me that this game is too similar to the first. You can tell me it's not worth the money just to lose out on all the mods the first has. You can tell me a lot of things about this game, but I don't care. I have played it nonstop since I bought it the other day and it's really strange.

I liked the first game a lot, don't get me wrong. I just feel differently about this one. The first game I saw as a sandbox train set experience. I never really played a free game without unlimited money, at any point, for more than 5 or so hours. I would just download cool maps, fiddle around with some nice trains for a few hours, and start fresh again a few days/weeks later. This time, it's different. I haven't even done a sandbox game yet in TpF2. I've actually played the game, on hard, and succeeded so far (1850 - 1950ish so far). Maybe I've finally figured out some of the systems, maybe the game is just straight up easier. I don't know and I don't care though. I find it very enthralling, especially with mods. Mod support already is insane too, I just wish I didn't have to sift through the dozens of maps sometimes. That's my only real complaint so far: stop uploading your poopoo maps, people.

I also want to highlight the map editor. The first 5 or more hours I spent with the game was simply generating a cool map I wanted with every thing that I liked. It was very hard for me to want to make a custom map in the first game as there wasn't an easy system like there is in TpF2. However, this editor is insanely fun to toy around with. Again, there's mods on the workshop for it to even further expand your horizons.

Final thoughts: Buy it if you liked the first, buy it if you like tycoon-esque games, buy it if you enjoy trains or whatever mode of transport you fancy, buy it and make sure to please thank the mod creators and support them. Vanilla, I'm sure this game is fantastic but the modding community makes it a joy to come back to day after day.

- Is it a new game?  No.  But it's a nice upgrade - but just re-uses a lot of the old vehicles.  You see very little different to TF1 in early years, but modern cities do look better.  If you can forgive 10FPS.
- Is it much better than TF1?  No.  The UI seems harder to use and being restricted to one pop up at a time is restrictive.  Mass replacement of vehicles is now a nightmare.  Auto replace is gone. 
- Is it worth the price?  No - wait until they fix the performance. 
- Do you need a beast of a PC?  Yes.  I have a decent rig (4 cores and a good 1080) but anything beyond small map is a stutter fest once the cities get busy.  Even small maps with busy cities are stuttery.

- Graphics are nice, audio is fantastic
- Early to mid game performance is great
- Mod support + Map editor

Lows:

-Campaign was largely disappointing with many side quests that exist simply to have you try out all the world building tools, or camera controls.  When you take time to complete said quests, there is no reward other than a 'gold star' rating on the mission.   I would have preferred putting all of those into the first mission, and then focusing on the core elements for the rest of the campaign missions, instead there are these little annoying missions all over the place.  I gave up on mission 5 or 6.

-Game runs at a solid 144 fps until you get four or five busy routes, then it starts to degrade to sub-60 fps by the four or five hour mark.  This is not uncommon for games in this genre, the simulation is quite complex, but I'm always hoping that some update will alleviate this stress.

55,Transport Fever 2,62281922,english,"Disclaimer: I bought this game with my own money and it was not given to me in any way shape or form. The review below is my own opinion on the game and there isn't anyone profiting from it, except from when I paid for it.

Transport Fever 2 is basically Transport Fever 1, but prettier with all kinds of quality of life improvements. I've had loads of fun with the first game and I never regretted buying the second. Even though there are a few negative points, they aren't really negative points at the same time, because I knew in advance that it wasn't going to happen.

See, I had been hoping that the second game could possibly have one of these maps that are technically endless. That and A.I controlled companies to making your life a bit more interesting. But like I said, neither of those two were going to happen, so it isn't really a negative point aside from the fact that they would have made the game a lot better.

Now, I'm not sure why I only have seven and a bit hours registered, since I played the game a lot more, but let me say that I know the game very well. If you're hesitating to buy the game, I would advise you to just watch a let's plays. Colonel Failure is a well known YouTuber, so take a look at his channel.

When I write a review, I always try to give a non biased opinion. I try to look at it, from the eyes of someone who doesn't like the game and then I try to go from there.

From that standpoint, there are a few things that come to mind. The first thing that comes to mind is that it can get boring. If you just start a new game without playing the campaign, it takes awhile to figure out what to do. It happened a few times, that when I was trying to get a chain going, that one part simply wasn't there. Oh, and while I'll admit that those times weren't mod free, the mods I had active had nothing to do with it.

Now, once you figure out what you're supposed to do, you really need to think about it. Watching a few lets plays will help trying to decide how you want to make money. By road, by rail, by water or by air. But once you do get a profit, you can basically let the game do its thing, wait an hour or two and then come back to have a small fortune to spend. A small fortune, you can then spent, wait until you're sure you're having a small profit and then let it go for a few hours again.

One thing I also like is that you can 'freeze' the time period, you're playing in. If you like to play way at the beginning, the 1850's, you can 'freeze' it at that time, and even though time still passes, you still make money and all that, but you'll never get newer vehicles. So all it really does, is that it prevents new vehicles from unlocking.

Another thing that also helps a lot is the amount of helpful mods people have already made. There are mods that are blatantly cheats and then there are mods that just make your life a bit easier. Or they're more easy going on your ears, by deleting the bulldozer sounds.

One thing that I also noticed is that there's been some copying and pasting going on. In the first TF you laid rails, roads, bought trains, bought vehicles, connected them to a route, you deployed them and eventually you make a profit. That's basically the same in TF2. That's not really a surprise, but if you ignore the improvements, then you have basically the same game. Prettier perhaps, but basically identical.

Now, if you enjoyed the first Transport Fever? Then you'll have loads of fun with this one. There's no doubt about that. But if you went 'meh' with the first TF and didn't really play it all that much after purchase? I would give this game a pass.

campain:
The campaign of the first game had a lot of humor to it. It had also only a single voice actor. TF2 has a unique voice actor for every campaign. But ultimately, I like the campaign of the first game better. It was just more amusing to play. That's why I wouldn't bother with the campaign in the second game. It sucks and there's no real connection between missions. Which is a shame. It would've been fun if you could have 'transferred' the money you had in the bank to the next mission.

CONCLUSSION:
I've already said this before, but it's really too bad that it's either YES or NO. There is no in between. If you already played the first game and you enjoyed yourself? Then YES! Buy it! If the first game bored you after a few hours, then NO, don't waste your money on it. But if you know the kind of game you're looking at, and you watched enough video's so you won't have any unpleasant surprises, then my ultimate conclussion is:

YES! Buy the game. Just make sure you know what you're getting yourself into.",1579796308,1579796308,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,593,35,1262,0,433,1596984028

58,Transport Fever 2,62269911,english,"Transport Fever is defently one of my favorite games! And i'm not gonna lie! I just bought this due to the improved graphics and details on different objects in the game, but let me try write a okey review that might convince you that this game is worth it more then just for the graphics.

Postive stuff:
- They added most of the previous items from Transport Fever to Transport Fever 2 + add extra objects etc.
- (i'm not a modder so i might be wrong on this) From what i seen the modding community have it way better with making mods for this game then the last one! + Now you can have signs on buses, trains etc that can say what the next station is and say what line this also is (i don't rename lines as i am used to seing numbers on buses etc instead of names)  Also you can now have Glow emission from what it looks. This makes it possible to have such amazing mods. (I highly reccomend the night mod!)
-AI improvements + Roundabouts and a functioning Highway, Ship and plane improvements.
- AN AMAZING CAMERA UPDATE! If you don't wanna bother with the controls in spectate mode on a bus you can always click escape and it still follows ur bus until u move your camera + You can then zoom in and out and use the middle mouse to rotate the camera around the bus, Those controls in my opinion are better then WASD and Arrow keys in spectate mode
- More customization before you start a free game + Improved stations with customization where you can go rampage with the settings, make a weird looking station or make a huge one. Pretty sweet.
- More customization on lines etc.
- Tabbing in and out of the game is working better

Negativity ish:
-This is techniclly a DLC. But i gonna be honest, as a DLC it would not make sense to have these graphic updates. so i do understand their reason for making it a brand new game due to improvements i believe had to be done.
- Don't have much negative to say about it!
- Takes high pc rescourses :(

59,Transport Fever 2,59879591,english,"There are quite a few disappointments like only 2 cargo needs per city (like get real!), adding entrances and exits to truck stations usually makes no difference since the trucks ignore an added nearby exit and go toward the shortest path. Whole truck stations can be backed up to enter or leave by one entrance or exit when there are 6 other entrances or exits free. Trucks stop halfway on cargo pads and back up everything. Mod available to correct this. Modding can add 6 cargo needs to a city. 6 lane highway, vehicles move to one lane forever and jam traffic even when alternate routes are traffic free. (Not AI traffic by far!).  Trucks are insanely stupid and pick wrong cargo and need to be micro-managed but with mods, the game is still very addicting.

Willbe addictive after you get the right mods and learn the games non-AI systems and how to overcome them. I am still trying to overcome the lack of  some needed AI.

- Immersion (very easy to lose a whole day in)

Cons
- Still a little glitchy at times (however it hasn't been out long)

16,Transport Fever 2,59788051,english,"[h1] Initial First Impressions Review, Subject to Change [/h1]

My system isn't exactly top notch, but I am having a right pain to get a decent framerate.

Win 8.1 GTX 970 4gb i7 4790k @4ghz 16GB DDR3 ram 1080p

Lots of instability on empty maps, of different sizes, climate, and generation settings. Never had this in the first title, only late game when you have a massive network spreading across the map. At this stage I should expect a constant 60 (which I lock to). Yeah... dropping to 12-30 with shoots to 60... too jarring.

Ingame settings don't seem to make any difference, neither do some NVIDIA CP tweaks. At this stage it is only the prospect of the modular buildings (that I have yet to tinker with) is keeping me from refunding this iteration.

Also, I was expecting a lot more modern railstock. I am a huge fan of huge American based maps, those long diesel cargo trains are just too fun. But took a quick look at what is available in 2000 on a US themed map. Three diesels. Three. No wellcars at all. Iconic American cargo railstock just... non-existent in the stock game.

I was sort of hoping for a wider range of equipment, but it seems I will once again be relying on the awesome folks at the Workshop to bring me what I'm looking for.

Very disappointing out of the box though, would I refund it? I don't want to, not really, but seeing how poorly an empty map seems to run I have little hope for how a built up map will handle.

Unscored at this time.


[h1] Update: Put in refund request [/h1]

So disappointed right now. Nicer graphics and some decent features does not make up for the games shortfalls. Poorly optimised, lack of new content, no groundbreaking improvement over the original... feels very much like a update to the first game than a sequel.

Will consider rebuying after lots of patches, some more FREE content, and will give the chance for the wonderful Workshop Modders to convert their stuff from TPF1.

Will also need a deep, deep sale for me to reconsider TPF2. I'll stick with Open TTD until I can be bothered to reinstall TPF1.

Do not believe the hype, seriously. I'm actually quite disconcerted about how some really quite popular content creators are lauding this game. At this time, as of release day, this is not worth a buy.

Refusing to score/10.

[b]EDIT 2[/b]

I rebought the game 'cos I caved, and I got the same TF1 owners deal. But it is awful. Laying tracks literally makes me seasick, and in a Railroad Logistics game you tend to do that quite a lot.

The new features are thin on the ground, ill-conceived and need balancing. Plus, the game needs more content [b]stock[/b]. At this point TF1 offers just as much, and that is before all those wonderful Workshop mods. 

I'm hoping TF2 gets some major love over the next few months, but quite honestly, the team behind this title needs a majorly stern talking to. The first title puts this one to shame.

If TF2 looks interesting to you, pick up the first game instead while on sale. It is the better package at this time.

[b]EDIT 3[/b]

How this can be reviewed as ""Very Positive"" on Steam I have no idea.

Performance is awful compared to the previous title, money is just thrown at you even on the hardest of settings, you have to be [b]incredibly[/b] stupid to go bankrupt. You can now edit a consist on the fly, no longer need to send to depot, [b]realism much?[/b]. 

The Modular Stations is so underwhelming and poorly used. I was under the impression that the extra add-on buildings would actually have a use; expanding the capacity of the station, processing goods/passengers faster, that sort of thing. But no, purely aesthetics. Aside from the ability to easily add in new tracks the feature is worthless.

It is fine for those that have not played Train or Transport Fever, but for those who have, do not upgrade to this title.

The learning curve is a bit steep, but this isn't why. Most new players that go in blind will probably go bankrupt, but looking up a guide can solve this very easily. Why I don't recommend it - even with multiple highly-profitable lines in operation, it takes a long time to build up cash to do anything. As in: Put the game on max speed, go cook something or tab out for 30 minutes and come back.

Then you fund a new project, which is interesting and fun for a time. If the result profitable, repeat the AFK session above. If it's an experiment that proves unprofitable, well... you might be AFKing to make up that lost cash a mite longer.

Yes, you should buy it.  No really.  Don't wait to read the rest of the review, get it in your cart and buy.  If you like this kind of game this is the only one that is essential to own.  Do it now.

Bought it?  Good.  Now relax and read the review.

The game is about using transportation to deliver goods and passengers on maps.  There is a campaign and a sandbox mode.  In the original Transport Fever the campaign was unplayable, but in TF2 the campaign is as important as the sandbox mode.  Business is less important in this game than good layouts, an understanding of the number and type of vehicles on each route, and an understanding that mass transit must be 'fed' from smaller arterial routes.

In many ways its the same as Transport Fever with quality of life updates, a new campaign, slightly better graphics and performance tweaks.  Most of the old frustrations, such as track-laying issues, still exist.  You still need to lay the track piece by piece, you can't undo what you lay without paying a fee to bulldoze, and you can't tweak a 'blueprint' of the track before you commit to it.  Also, signals are still hand-built, one at a time.  Its so last-decade.  Yes, there have been many competitor games that have done a better job of track laying, but none of them are in the same league as this game overall.

On the plus side, the campaign is a genuine, enjoyable, sensible set of missions designed for the people likely to want to buy the game.  The original Transport Fever had a campaign that was utterly appalling.  TF2 learned their lesson and the new campaign (I've almost finished it) has a better balance.  Its not perfect, but its acceptable.  You don't have to exploit the game engine to complete the missions as you had to do in Transport Fever, which is always nice.

This is largely a game about trains, but that does do it a disservice.  The Miami campaign has no trains on it whatsoever, and it shows what can be achieved with the other assets.  But the trains are the most enjoyable part of the game, and honestly the other transportation feels underdeveloped.  Boats are always very close to being useless, and aircraft carry such small amounts of passengers and cargo they also feel weak.  But they do add some options, and they have been creatively used in some campaign missions justifying their inclusion.

The types of vehicles available without modding are limited and strangely chosen.  There are a lot of similarly-priced steam engines with very similar performance and price that seem to have been added to appeal to the Chinese player.  I've seen no British trains (yet the UK invented the locomotive), but a large number of nondescript Russian models, some quite weak Chinese types, and an eclectic and baffling selection of electrics and diesels.  There's no sense or theme it seems to what locomotives get included in the game and what are left out, whether from a gameplay viewpoint or general coherence.   Its not a deal-breaker, but choice is lacking.

I haven't played the sandbox mode yet.  Some people have criticised this aspect of the game, but I can't comment on something I haven't tried. 

Graphics are somewhat nicer that Transport Fever, and the physics engine feels as excellent as ever.  The sound varies, and the samples feel very repetitive after a time.  But presentation is good and the overall feel is solid.

At the end of the day, this game is a masterpiece.  That's why you need to buy it.  Criticising individual elements of gameplay is like commenting on rough brushwork in the Mona Lisa.  Just accept you will have to own this game, you will enjoy it, and the failings will be addressed to some extent by the astonishing modding community.

Graphics are better, but should have been even better in my opinion.

The maps are nice but have these bizarre white rocks scattered about to create a sense of change in the scenery, that needs improvement and we need multi biome maps. Maps seems smaller and industry is reduced, but I do feel like you are more pressed into creating multi layered networks that rely on each other and feed each other. Planes and ships work better but need far more choice in terms of vehicles.

I found myself getting bored a little quicker than TF1 but that said I can't go back to TF1, and am patiently waiting for all the mods to be ported across.

I do hope the dev decides to add a expansions/DLC this time to improve the game (day night cycles, more industries and such).

I like this game and it's very relaxing, but I wish there was a bit more challenge to it, I'm a gazzilionaire already. I do wish they had competing AI players like transport tycoon, but I realise that would be super hard to code. Maybe one day.

56,Transport Fever 2,61882511,english,"This game does alot right and is highly enjoyable for people who like trains, city managment and have alot of time to kill.

Although it does have it's faults

Pro's

1: Very large and detailed maps
2: a Wide variaty of different trains, trucks, buses, planes and ships to use
3: 3 Different regional styles/themes
4: 3 Different map styles
5: a Campaign which is more like a glorified tutorial
6: Modular stations
7: Start as early as 1850 all the way into 2050
8: The ability to pause the dates while keeping the sim running

Cons

1: No variety in ships or planes throughout the 3 different themes
2: I have not played TF 1 but, It has come to my attention that USA and Europe themes are almost identical with very little new stuff added
3: No variety in station apearances, which looks the same in all 3 themes
4: No day/night cycle or any weather effects
5: Unable to move/buldose industries in ""Free Game"" mode
6: Consumer and Supplier industries sometimes spawn lightyears away from eachother

Suggestions

1: Allow the ability to move/buldose industries in Free game provided they are replaced within a small radias of their original location, this will allow more freedom in ""Free Game"" without allowing players to cheese the game by placing industries right next to eachother
2: Day/Night cycle (Purely asthettic reasons)
3: This one might be harder... weather and weather effects, having seasonal weather changes and then in turn having them effect transit I.E it's harder to drive in snow etc. This will provide some additional challenge to an otherwise fairly easy late game
4: Get some variety in aircraft and ships regarding the themes, it get's boring real quick when they look the same for USA, Europe and Asia

59,Transport Fever 2,59720558,english,"Edit, 126 hours in, still having a lot of fun, still agree with what I've posted below...

I have over 500+ hours in TPF and really enjoyed it, and this one is fun too, but that being said, this is an early review, which I know can be incomplete, and my opinion could change past the 40-60 hour mark.  Also, I’ve been watching Youtubers for two weeks, so I didn’t go in without seeing quite a bit of gameplay.

Keep in mind, I play at 4K, but have a mid-ranged PC setup, but 16GB of RAM, game runs pretty well.

The Asia map gives the game a different feel, while the temperate one still feels close to TPF with an improvement to graphics that is noticeable, but the Asia map really feels different.  The Desert map I could take or leave, I'll need to play that more to see what I think.  

Ships are profitable (currently on medium difficulty) and are rather fun this go around, I've made three maps so far; a river route, islands, and a desert.  

When running trains, it feels a lot like TPF, so at times, I'm not feeling like there's anything new there, but replacing vehicles and the new maintenance options are different.  Also, modular stations are cool, and I really like that we can combine passenger/cargo stations and linking across different types of transportation, trains, trucks, boats, planes.

I do like how information is presented for line management, etc. in the new version.  The new management menus are fantastic, possibly my favorite part, the information is presented better than it was in TPF.  I don't know if I'll get 500+ hours out of this one, but I enjoyed the first 7 hours played today.  Road and track laying also seem to be improved, smoother, easier bridges, overpasses…

Am I having fun?  Yes.  Am I over the moon?  Not necessarily.  Would I go back to TPF1?  No.  

I do believe TPF2 is a great game, just doesn’t feel like a huge leap forward, but lots of QOL improvements that are worth it.  

For the future - I'm curious to see how large, full route, busy maps run, so that is also yet to be determined.",1576168545,1579055978,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,76,19,15354,3469,453,1602042594

78,Transport Fever 2,61660692,english,"Like the name suggests, it's Transport Fever (or Train Fever for all that matters). The core gameplay loop didn't change much from the previous titles - you build transport networks and deliver goods to factories and towns. If you played either of the other games you will instantly feel at home.

There are 18 missions grouped into 3 campaigns roughly by era (early, steam, modern). The campaigns are ok-ish and more of an introduction to the ""real"" game, which is freeplay.

The graphics are good, the performance is ok (though my computer probably is not representative for the majority, I can't really tell how it's for averge and lower end PCs)

I liked the music in TPF1 more, but there is a mod for that. 

Which brings me to, the game has mod support and thanks to a very active modding community the Workshop is stuffed with all sort of things, from simple tree assets over vehicles to different map-generators and complete industry overhauls (it probaly also helps that porting mods from TPF1 doesnt seem overly complicated, tho I cant really tell)

The economic side of the game is pretty weak, once you built a few profitable connections, you'll just get richer and richer. So if you looking for a real challenge here it's probably not for you. The puzzle side of the game is, thanks to towns only requiring 2 (out of 6) goods, pretty strong though, even stronger than TPF1. And if you like it like it was in TPF1 -> ""there is a mod for that""

All in all I would recommend the game if you are into building transport (or lets be honest train)-networks. It's also nice for just building scenic train lines with money disabled.

- campaign
  Gives nice context, many missions with various challenges.

- lots of cars, trucks, trains, wagons, plains
- build process
  It's easy to learn how to build anything, and tracks looks very nice.

- working Linux version
  I've played on both versions windows and Linux and this is big plus, they look same on both OSes.

CONS:
- build process
  Misses automatic signal placement, in intervals 200m for example.

- translation in polish is not very polished ;)

- line broken finding / not finding
  When complex line is broken I can't find easily where it's broken, and sometimes I must destroy whole chunks of network to find where problem is

- trams
  If this is transportation simulator, why the hell trams can rotate in place when stop is on opposite side of road? In normal life they need loop to change direction.

- indestructible trains
  Trains don't broke, they don't need to go into depot for fixing. Even in very bad shape they are driving.
  I have train with very bad condition and it don't need repairs, it does not go into depot.
  Depot is only needed to spit out the train and that's it.

- train repairs -
  They should be optional and available to schedule. Train would be repaired to good shape and replaced only when it's too old.

- trains replacing/building
  I can replace train and it's wagons in place... They don't need to go to depot to do that.

- trains can't unload on first free platform
  Traffic dispatcher in normal life direct train to free platform when it is necessary. Even when station has 8 platforms your line will use only one...

- platforms overloading
  I have two lines over three stations.
  First station to load iron, second to load coal, third to unload both.
  One train on each line has 20 wagons of same type.
  Game knows that I can grab for example 200 units of coal, but instead of doing it right it overloads first line, leaving nothing to second. Why???

  Don't leave this one to economy. Both mines with coal and iron produces 400 units.
  Two mines produces 800 units, and I am using 40 wagons (20 units each).
  So two trains loading 50% of coal and 50% of iron can handle that easily.

  If this could be economy problem, why mines are producing at that scale?

  Image with overloading situation:
  https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1967517785

  Second problem is that they are waiting for something, even when they are fully loaded with required cargo. Why?
  Waiting problem is not present while there is only one line and one track...

Some of these problems are with us from first version of game.
This game is v1.4 not v2.",1578862850,1578862850,FALSE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,324,3,3731,0,3731,1578860925
85,Transport Fever 2,61765960,english,"It is exceptionally rare for a sequel to be better than the original in every single way.  Transport Fever 2 is one of those cases.

While I enjoyed TF1, the vanilla version never felt ""fully formed"" to me.  There were economic problems, balance issues, and oddball vehicle stats that I could never resolve.  I am thrilled that ALL of those issues have been resolved in TF2, and am having an absolute blast with this game.

The devs have been hard at work eliminating some of the Day One bugs:  I had several crashes during my first playthrough, and one fatal error that prevented me from continuing in a world I had built.  This was frustrating, but I have had no similar occurrences since the first (mid-December) patch.

As ever, the modding community for TF is thriving, and every day a new asset or map or script enhancement is made available which contributes to the endless replayability of the title.  Modders for TF1 were ingenious and helpful, and the devs' encouragement of those mods continue to make this community a welcome one.

If you are old-school enough, think of this game as falling midway between Cities Skylines and Railroad Tycoon 2.  Its most apt comparison is probably to the old Transport Tycoon:  You can build roads, rails, and ship routes, but you do not directly build cities and do not build industries at all.  Maps are procedurally generated and not geographically-based, although seemingly every day a new 'true-to-life' map is added to the Workshop.  TF2 comes with a map editor which allows you to sculpt terrain and build cities and industries where you want them.  It even provides a Sandbox mode so you can build your world without worrying about pesky things like costs and fees.  There is a campaign mode which is basically just there to teach you game mechanics; having played TF1 I got halfway through the campaign before bailing out and starting my own world.

There is a broad ability to customize what you build.  Stations are modular, so you can make hybrid passenger-cargo stations by adding a platform of your choice.  Stations, lines, and vehicles can all be named...and the attention to detail here is really fun:  Seeing the name of a line scroll across the digital display on the front of a bus is strangely cool.

There are a LOT of small details like that which the devs have clearly made a priority.  Lights transition from incandescent to LED over time, people walk from place to place, and do not cease being ""people"" once they enter a vehicle.  In older games, people would stand at a platform, board a vehicle, and disappear.  The other day I watched people board a tram, take their seats, and interact.  A lady crossed her legs, put her hands in her lap, then began ""talking"" to a guy across from here, gesturing with her hands as he gestured back. It looked real, immersive.  And I loved it.

I have only really found two quibbles with this game.  The first is the life cycle of vehicles, specifically how they are swapped out when their age becomes cost-prohibitive.  For whatever reason I find it a little more challenging to do a simple repurchase of the same vehicle.  I try and ""Clone"" it, but the vehicle spawns at some odd location far from where I want it.  This might be user error, but if that is the case it probably should not be so difficult for the user.  My second dislike is the new ""emissions"" mechanic.  I don't like it.  At all.  It provides needless complication and seems almost arbitrary in how it is designed:  An idling vehicle that hasn't moved magically provides emissions along its entire route?!  You're killing me.  There is a mod to kill this feature and I may take that up as it detracts from my transportation utopia.

But when something that small is your big problem with a game, you know you have stumbled onto something rare.  TF2 is a rare and welcome achievement in the Transport Tycoon mold, and is the best game I purchased in 2019.

YOU'LL LOVE:  The numerous vehicles available, the efficient UI, the simplicity of building, the wide ability to customize stations, the attention to small, fun details.

YOU'LL LIKE:  The vast array of mods created by an active community, the challenge of starting ""in the hole"" with money lent to you, the ability to merge multiple forms of transportation to take goods across an attractively detailed map.

YOU'LL DISLIKE:  The inability to use your accumulated wealth to build industries or buy property, the occasional end-of-lifecycle replacement difficulties, the emissions mechanic.",1578862527,1578862527,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,114,8,7748,0,5060,1580196743

The graphics are much more pleasing and it's a treat to ride around on your vehicles looking at the view. Track laying is improved, but familiar. Trucks work better and the stops are improved. Ships are now worth having and bring a lot more to the game. Aircraft need a lot more work and really seem like an afterthought. Stations of all types can now be customised and improved, with the exception of airports. This is a real weakness because as the aircraft get better you need a bigger airport and the only way to do that is to demolish the old one and rebuild. This is difficult because they take up so much room, it really isn't worth using planes until the airport upgrades to large. My favourite terrain is the new tropical islands as it's beautiful - but airports don't fit very well.

Production is also very confusing and not explained well in the tutorial.
I think you're better off watching some let's plays or something. Some things also just don't work the way you'd expect it to work without any explanation, for instance, when a train collects let's say silver ore from a quarry, the whole station could be filled with it, but the train would only take 9/32, don't make any sense, I had this happen with trucks as well. EDIT: also found out if let's say a truck station has 2 lines collecting a product from it, it will just fill up the line 1 side to the point it literally throws away excess product, while line 2 is not getting anything..

It becomes a tedious task to continually replace vehicles or adjust the maintenance whenever.
 But it's only a minor mechanical nitpick to the style of play I have; not enough to prevent me from recommending this game.

That's not to say that it doesn't have a few annoying bugs, but I expect them to be sorted out in a reasonable amount of time. For now, I tend to look past that, or find work-around's, like I do with any recently launched games. The Dev's may not respond much on Steam, but they do read complaints as you can see when they post a patch/update.

The graphics got a notch or two better, and more detailed. The mechanics have improved, while some seems ripe for a fix or two. Still, it's an addictive game, and I expect to get many hours of enjoyment that I did with the other two version.

74,Transport Fever 2,61437896,english,"I think this is the first time, when I really had mixed feelings about a game. I played quite a bit with TF1 and I was waiting for this game, but after playing the game for a couple of hours I am not even sure if I can recommend it over TF1.
The things that are value in TF2 are
- map preview
- modular stations
- easier to build cross connections in front of the stations
- easier to manage/clone/upgrade vehicles
- improved cargo transport rules
Unfortunately this doesn't make it good enough for a 2nd version of the game, but these are clear improvements.
Clearly they put a lot of effort into graphics so probably you can spend a lot of time beautifying the map, but after setting up a couple of good profitable line there is no real challenge anymore.

Couple of things that I'd expect to improved in a 3.0
- more balanced play. It is really difficult to start to set up lines as they are really expensive in the early years, but later the money just flows and you can't spend it.
- things that shouldn't make sense are generating a huge profit (e.g. transfer raw material using plane is not a reasonable choice, but generating more profit than a similar train line) Probably the transport price should be changed as you don't need to look for the reasonable option. e.g if the factory would pay a certain amount of money for the materials, then you may not want to use plane instead of train.
- city traffic is pretty dumb for both passengers and cargo. It is difficult to get it right due the scaling of the maps, but a marriage between Cities in motion and TF would be the happiest relationship ever. As it is now it is a couple of stops here and there and create a loop. 
- kind of pointless to use small cargo trucks later in the game as money is not a problem and their emission is not that much different
- very simplistic production path. in fact I am not sure if any recent game has such a minimalist and simple production path. I really expected more on this front. e.g. cities could produce things and not only consume.
- cities not accepting certain resources is a change, but personally I dislike it. Again in real life all cities needs food, fuel and so on. I prefer simulation closer to the real life.

I think most of these were similar in TF1, so no big surprises here, but the moment when I asked the 'what's next?' question, when I've received the badge because I provided all the resources to all cities. I've checked the industries and most of the things were maxed out. Sure I can tweak things here and there, but I didn't have the same feeling with TF1 and that's why I will get back to that at some point.

As a summary; if you liked TF1 you wanna play this too, but for me this is just a new major release (e.g. TF 1.1) and I am happy that I didn't pay the full price. I'd feel being ripped off.

84,Transport Fever 2,61412494,english,"The predecessor Transport Fever is one of may favcorite games. I ve spent a lot of time with what I call tranportation meditation optimizing and tweaking my transportation network while listening to audiobooks or music.

As I'm linux only and was allways very pleased with the great Linux support i instantly preordered Transport Fever 2. And I'm not disappointed. The game runs really good natively on my Linux rig.

To the game itself:
Transport Fever 2 is more of an evolution as a revolution. It improves an allready very good game in many areas of gameplay. So far the most obvious and notricable improvements for me are:
- new scenario/theming: Asia (vehicles) and tropical (landscape)
- terraforming of water, e.g. rivers/seas (Damn, i really wantred to have this in TF 1)
- set specific filters for goods for a line, e.g. only load/unload a specific resource or even none - again somehting i always wanted to have

However the most epic new feature for me is the modular expansion system for all kind of satations which is way more flexible than before.

There are for sure more improvements I did not mentioned - Urban Games overhauled most areas of the gameplay. Which brings me to a downside: I do not like the new UI design. The border frames of info boxes are to big. I'am used to have pined several in parallel from TF1. This is no longer possible - I just can't have that many boxes open in paralell as in TF1, Secondly the lines management window (and some others) now sticks to the bottom of the screen and are no longer flexible resizable which makes it less comfortable for me. Another point is, that I personally dislike the style of the new ressource items and orthers. However this is very subjective and no sort blocker for playing the game. Maybe there will be mods altering the style.

The keyword mods is bringing me to the community modding support which is exellent. Just one month after release there are allready more than 1000 downloads in the workshop. Many of the addons there are of exellent quality and really improve the games. There are even mods altering the default gameplay. I really appreciate this openess towards modding. 

Finally there is the update politic of Urban Games from the past not letting the game abandoned just after release and providing improvements and fixes even more than a  year after the releease.

If you are not looking for a serious economy simulaon and enjoy building and managing trransportation networks over time I really recommend this game.

There is some nice upgrades made, but all the changes I would expect from a patch, not from a total new game. At least on my PC TF2 is not as performant as TF1 and I do not have the worst hardware. On larger maps, it is sooo laggy, I can´t play it.  I hope they can make some performance changes with the coming patches.

I absolutely like the modular station construction, UI is nice, tho vehicle upgrade is a bit messy at very first time. 

I absolutely recommend it at this point, and absolutely recommend it later, when devs add's more stuff and do performance and other improvements.

P.S.

Now after enjoying this for bit more, i wanna add some stuff.

First of all, FPS is mostly good, especially compared to TF1, yea, its still a drop of fps at late game, tho game is mostly playable with out problems. At my current 3400+ year date, game starts to lag a bit by it self, while FPS might be high enough, thats probably will be fixed within first patches.

I absolutely love how new building system works, allowing you do things you could only wish at TF1, junctions, crosses and awsome ""engineering"" now can be done, making really massive and crazy hubs. 
Modular stations are also as i already mentioned - great thing.
Im a bit sad due simplified cargo chain, but that's also might be soon added with mods.

I still absolutely recommending game, if you loved TF1 - you will love this for sure. Be a little patient with some possible bugs and things, as game is just released, let the devs collect some mass-use data from all our differend hardware and do good fixes / patches.

[EDIT]
Okay, now i have over 300 hours played, time to update a bit.

I have reached far to year 4000+ without date-edition and managed to grow absolutely huge cities with crazy junctions, inner/outer commuter lines in capital, and cities spread so wide.

What i was surpriced off is the FPS. It was mostly stable 55-60 and some times in capital center dropping to 22-34 which for me is pretty playable, this is not FstPrsnShtr, so a little fps drop not really disturbs. Still there was a lag caused from insane car amount, which we personally discussed with devs, they managed to re-create issue and this will be fixed within next patch. (Super great developers, rly best i've contacted with).
So basically im still strongly recommend the game, patches are comming, improvements, as always will be implented. Game is absolutely playable at year 4k+, especially if not using >>> time, the lag i mentioned before ISNT happening at > or >> speeds and even in capital core center with huge traffic between main trainstation with 16 platforms, serving 21 train-line and core tram hub with 10+ lines, as well as car traffic.

One way streets, traffic signals, modular mixed (passenger and cargo) stations, core industries always produce max, truck (unloading) stops, and a noticeable graphics improvement are things you can look forward to.
A small performance penalty and the removal of vehicle auto-replacement (and currently $40 retail) is the cost you'll incur.
So the upgrade is mostly benefits, but small ones, so I understand $40 being a bit of a hurdle.

It's like SimCity, but instead of running the government/utilities, you run the bus and cargo lines to support the cities. Build roads, tram lines, train tracks, harbors, and airports, plan out your lines, purchase the appropriate vehicle(s), and expand your empire or go broke trying!

Some cargo types are laso removed form the base game (livestock and furnace slag). It makes freight dynamics a bit mickey-mouse.

Quality of life:
- tool for easy upgrade of obsolete buildings like train stations,,
- tool for easy upgrade of bridges,
- some tick option for some vehicles to auto renew after they become in bad state. currently i have domething around 500 vehicles and it's tedious job to renew them by hand,
- map filters should be remembered after a save load, so that i don't have to disable the annoying cost and revenue icons,

Features to add:
- more complicated chains of products? Maybe products availability depending on the current date?
- please add intercity bus models

Pros:
Great game, interface is easy enough to understand and interpret
The progression mid and late game is fantastic.
Fun progression. The first time I bought the Flying Scotsman and saw it flying down the track, double the speed of my other trains, all my signals working perfectly, the money I made from it, it was all very satisfying.
Reordering bus routes and installing bus lanes, updating buses to move people quicker, making unprofitable routes profitable again, all great work.

Cons:
The way the game distributes resources between lines from, say, a refinery, is very poor and requires some fleshing out. For example, I have a problem with loading speed from an oil well to a refinery. So I create 2 identical lines with 2 identical routes so I can load trucks on 2 terminals simultaneously. The game then continues to fill only one line with Crude or only fills the other with a tiny amount, making it very inefficient even though we all know that the real world is full of simultaneous loading docks, an oil refinery doesn't just load one tanker at a time.
Same with passengers, etc and you will be waiting a long time on one line and the other line continues to be overloaded even though they're the same. bloody. thing.
The progression before say 1890 can be a bit dull.
The progression after 2020 should have futuristic trains, planes, boats, buses, etc.
You can't choose to replace a tram with a bus, which is often required, it should be an option with a warning.
The game unlinked a few oil wells from truck depots without any reason when I loaded a save, lost me a fortune and left me scratching my head.
Clickable buttons like Manage Route and Manage Vehicle stop working without any obvious reason.

With all that being said, it's all fixable what they need to work on. It the parts that define what the game are that they got right. I love this game. I want it to expand and grow and I'd love to see more game modes or extra parts to it for me to enjoy.

71,Transport Fever 2,61161482,english,"Having played this game a while now. I can say that I do enjoy it. However I feel that this game is seemingly more of a sidestep than an upgrade. I feel that with the amount of time and mods that have gone into the previous game, there should have been some elements of those modded features placed into this iteration.

For example. As of now, we don’t have a variety of stations to use. Although you can make modular ones, it doesn’t offer much by way of assets to place to make station unique. Curved, Elevated (even directly over roads as well), Open-cut, and underground stations are absent. And that’s just part of the features that I feel should have been native to this game. I’m guessing maybe like before, it will come in the form of a free download/update content. Which I’m not complaining. But to be quite honest, as this is a Small developer, I personally would have paid a little more out of support, if it meant those features in particular were already in game and the modding community could expand off of that, instead of porting over recycled mods.

Aside from that. I hope to see the features that I’ve mentioned above make it into the vanilla game in a later update or expansion. I’d hope from the devs or skilled content creations from the community that some more American based content in the form or trains especially, like commuter equipment as that was very small in number with the last product. Something preferably from the northeast region of the US, which has a huge variety of equipment in comparison to the rest of the country. For example: Long Island Railroad, Metro North, New Jersey Transit, to name a few and some American Subway/Metro cars.

So, I’m asking, please to either the devs or skilled modders/content creators to please look into expanding on those for this game. Otherwise this is still a great game to pickup.

Improvements from Transport Fever:
1. The visuals seem to be upgraded quite a bit
2. The scenarios were interesting (although some of them were perhaps a bit too easy)

Fatal Flaws:
1. The vehicle replacement breaks the game for me.   I can't work on something new to expand my transport network because I have to spend so much effort replacing aging vehicles.  This was automated in Transport Fever 1.  Now it's manual.  And it's SO TEDIOUS!  But if you don't do it,you go from making millions to losing millions seemingly overnight.

2. The auto-growth of cities keeps breaking my transport stations by disconnecting them from the roadway!  I'm building a rail line or something and then before I know it, my entire transport network has collapsed and I'm 20 million in debt because a key cargo station is no longer connected to the road!  

It's exhausting how much ongoing care and feeding a city needs just to remain stable.  It really kills the fun of the game.  I have been building and improving  the same city in Cities:Skylines for hundreds of hours, but I can't do that in Transport Fever 2.  After 4 or 5 hours, the transport system is such a maintenance nightmare that there is no time to build anything onto it!  I am too busy replacing vehicles and repairing broken stations.

I WOULD recommend this game to BRAND NEW players, but for people coming from TF1 you will be surprised to see the return of a bug from the previous game, where you type a line name and the map goes into none stop moving mode, only way to stop the map moving is to mash the WASD keys, so that tells me they have either used the engine from the previous game or they have brought over several of the old bugs into an slightly upgraded one. 

Game looks nicer than TF2 and the interface is better but that is about it. Moving from TF1 to TF2 you are paying £20+ for a slightly improved visual experience, and 90% of the same game as TF1.

I had a feeling the improvements would be marginal from this developer, the same thing happened going from Train Fever to Transport Fever 1 – same assets and engine used just some extra things thrown in a mod could do for free. 

I think when TF3 comes out next year with a tree that moves in the wind but everything else is the same just in a nicer looking environment I might give it a miss.

This game is great and excellent but there still has some point that worth to be improved. First, when putting the train-road from one station to another, the road usually become a curve line which is longer than the straight line, and train had to cost more time to deliver the cargo. I hope you can add a new feature that user can change the angle of the curve line instead to be forced to construct the railway little by little.

And the 2nd one is that the finance at the left-down side is not clear for user who want to know whether they put too many trains, stations, plane, which the benefit is enough to pay for the maintaining fee or not. Once I construct too many air-station and airplane then I found that my earning is not bigger than my costing, so I had to make a ""new game"" and I became much more cautious about making airplanes.

35,Transport Fever 2,60998837,english,"It is a huge improvement of an already good game.
There are some big improvements like more detailed graphic, better terrain modifier tool, adjustable time speed (you can even stop the time and playing in a certain date forever), modular stations.
And there are many many many welcomed small improvements like rotatable cockpit view, icons display off in cockpit mode, coloring vehicles when a line selected, signals can be preselect as oneway before placing them, clone vehicles from vehicle view, modify tool for trains, roads can be connected to industrial buildings from any sides, resource flow view, big resource icon at stations instead of many small ones (you won't see 30 icons for 300 goods), when you demolish anything you built the terran is reverting back to its original... and many many other minor things which cause a huge confortable feeling together.
There were the improvements, look at some changes. But before, let me make a little difference between impovements and changes. Improvements are obviusly make a game better, however changes might be argued.  
There is a change in the game for increasing challenging level: only two resources are demanded by cities. Maybe that wouldn't be the only solution for increasing challenging level, but I think it's still better than it was and probable there already are mods for those who doesn't like it.
Maintenance system changed: vehicles cause pollution wich increases with age and negatively affects town growth. With this change you have more options to handle vehicle aging. Oh, btw. town grow I forgat to mention it...
I think I wrote enought to express my opinion about the game even it is based on comparing to the previuos version which I also loved.
One more appreciation for the developer team who really cares about the game and the gamers and works on patches with bugfixes and further improvements eg. the train edit tool come with a patch shortly after the release, because many people wanted.

38,Transport Fever 2,60991497,english,"It's micro-managing on a country scale, a perfect simulation for some of my old bosses!

This is another game that needs a mid-range grade scale, but since I must vote Yes or No then I'm tilting towards the yes side.  While this simulation has some excellent graphics and tools/filters to work with, it also comes with a few rather annoying issues.  That fan-boys have already been on my case touting that 99% of these bug reports are user errors who don't understand the game, and I would agree that the game is complex enough it's easy to not understand that it's you not developing your routes according to the game mechanics.  However, the issues I have found are just down right annoying and suck so much joy out of the development you've spent hours setting up and nurturing.  I find myself just getting frustrated and walking away more times than I'd prefer, but I do keep coming back to try again.

A minor issue I have is with the automatic handling of routes, it's both a blessing and a curse.  If I want to move a bus station and delete one on a current route and build a new-one nearby within a short time, then the route will self-repair the old stop with the new stop, very nice.  However, if I drop in a new cargo station that happens to be nearby to a bus stop then the bus route detaches from that stop and connects to the cargo stop and then gives me a route error, which I now have to figure out how to fix.  If you're still new to the game, this can get quite annoying trying to figure out why your perfectly running route is now all flubbed up.

Another real PITA is factory and route setups, sometimes you just can't get the factory to process correctly, I find this happens most often if you develop a couple of new factory runs while the game is paused.  Trucks will show up and not pickup the cargo or the cargo delivered won't produce the phase of materials.  But if I click on the delivery vehicle while it's pulling up to the station then all of a sudden it starts to work.  This takes the micro-managing to a new level of annoying.

And finally, routes have a hard time letting go of an old route if the current one gets interrupted with a break in the route.  I've had a back/forth route through a city where the deliver routes clearly favored the path to the ""right"", and basically had a big doughnut hole route through a city.  I demolished a short strip of road to force a stop to one of those sides through the city as it was a tad longer and less efficient, but the route now reports and error with no way to clear it.  Deleting the route and re-creating it still bore the same error despite having a successful line developed between the points.  I suspect the issue is that the road was a program developed road and not a user developed road, so the route manager is expecting the road to be and refuses to work until it's back.

Overall, it still can be fun to play especially if you like getting your fingers into every niche and cranny of a transportation business.  If you're not into micro-managing or problem solving, then this one might not be for you.",1577801943,1577802271,TRUE,0,0,0.482687563,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,128,50,6158,0,4677,1578760546

77,Transport Fever 2,60906151,english,"-Summary-
TF 2 is a major improvement on the old game, but there are some things that need attention for the game to be great.

-What's new-
TF 2 is basically a reconstruction of the first game, taking the strong points of what was a bit of a rough production and bringing it a lot further along the line from love of labour modding to a properly designed and implemented game. There is significant expansion on the earlier one, including improved graphics, town operation, vehicles and other things. If you've played the first game, you will almost certainly think this is a step up.

- The Rub -
Like the other TF 2 game, much of what made the original good was the work of modders in the workshop. This ranged from new vehicles to buildings and mods that took the game from normal to good. Likewise, the original game also received some big improvements overtime by the original developers. It's going to take a while for the workshop to upload content to catch up to where it was before, the game needs some important performance updates to make the game more powerful, and to get some features to work. Many have noted that some features can't work at the moment without tanking even high level computers. Likewise, adding some content that was in the original game that hasn't made it into the new one would also be good (such as bridge choices and the like). It'll take most of 2020 for the game to wear in, but with a few changes under the hood, the game will go from good to great.

Buy it, but be prepared to wait for a few things.",1577706189,1577706189,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,238,11,7171,0,1363,1600582100

91,Transport Fever 2,60047141,english,"So I have now completed every mission and all bonuses. The Shanghai Bonus for the tower was a pain in the a-s-s. The entire scenario basically was. Both options, trains and aircraft lose money. The maintenance costs override the ticket income.
There are some major tips to compete each mission.
Try to stick with what the mission asks you to do, but do it your way. Some suggestions is to only use unprofitable lines only if the mission requires it. Then as soon as you complete it, delete the line to save money if you feel it will no longer be needed. Sometimes you may get a ""big brain time"" moment to figure out ways to exploit missions to complete them that doesn't break the rules. In the last few missions, traffic can become extremely tedious, so avoid connecting cities with roads. Private traffic will take advantage of that and clog up the roads. If this happens, building separated elevated roads for trucks may benefit.

Note to Developer: The game crashes when performing large actions for example placing traffic circles in towns even when buildings have already been demolished.

12-26-19 - Having to reinstall the game after it crashed. The game crashed so hard, it actually uninstalled itself.
The previous day I was doing a free mode trains only and at one point, the music stopped and  got me panicking because I hadn't saved in a while. When I clicked to go save the game, it did nothing as if it was doing some do not interrupt background processes and felt threatened to become multitasking as Steam games do not like to multitask. Sure enough, the game just completely closed. I decided to play something else to cool my frustration and when I went to load up the next day, I noticed it was greyed out on my list of games.

-The game looks beautiful, but the missions have a few annoying quirks.
-The vehicles often have an extremely difficult issue to understand what you want them to do and will constantly go to places that they do not need to go to for example going to an unload station first. It is useful for busses only as it helps to spread out the line initially.
-It is common to see a vehicle with a full load or after unloading, sit and wait at a station despite being told they can leave.
-The missions don't specify exactly what it wants done, so you basically have to waste a lot of time and money through trial and error to figure out what to do. I see why you start with so much money for each mission. Many of the time, missions can often be completed at a budget loss.
-There are points of some missions where you are not allowed to purchase certain items needed to earn profit, for example, the Swiss mission wants you to build electric trains, but you can only buy it right after being asked, but no longer when at the next task. It is also odd how one of the vehicle descriptions says it was widely used in Switzerland, but it can't be purchased until a specific point, and only one is allowed to be purchased.
-The mission speech will often interrupt, for example, open windows suddenly close. The bonus missions are usually the culprit as they are random events. (This may have been resolved as it has not been as much an inconvenience.)
-The unique music for the missions is a nice touch and adds to the ambience, but it becomes very repetitive when tasks become longer than expected as it plays the same track until the next task even after changing the track.
-It is nice to see many different ways to check the lines, vehicles, and budget, but it can sometimes be frustrating to go through so many windows just to see exactly what you want to see.
-Some of the achievements are not displaying. Do some only apply during campaigns and some in free mode? (yes. I have gotten the achievements in Free Mode for doing the same things I did in the campaign.) There are many things that are not clear and is the most common issue is not knowing exactly what the game wants to be done.
-I'm glad to see an option to turn off autosave now. Always remember to save in case the game closes for no reason, however, I assume it's mostly a Steam issue, as many other games sometimes close without warning.
-The help menu could be expanded to show exactly what the tools do. I am still not 100% sure what exactly signals do. I have had some trains blow right through signals even with another train in the way.
-I would love to see left hand traffic as an option in the future. The Shinkansen mission has been the most intriguing. I felt it was the only thing missing when compared to when I lived in Japan.",1576634055,1577657773,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,39,12,22723,0,3461,1594840028

I read some reviews where people panned it as simplified because you don't need to provide 6 resources to each town now; it's only 2. I disagree - it's actually harder this way. You can't just see a town's near a quarry and a brick pit and think 'sweet, easy money!', because that town might only want bread and machinery. You might start developing a handful of towns and have to fly the bricks in, because the locals don't want them.

Things to be aware of:
- Difficult to remove tracks, roads, and items. There is no mass destroy or destroy from point to point. Be careful when placing tracks, it's a pain to fix things.
- The UI is not super informative. It gives information but doesn't explain the info very well in a lot of places. I'm sure playing the campaign would explain things better, but jumping strait in takes some learning.
- Building roads in grids is very difficult. The game has a lot of issues similar to cities skylines without the mods to help alleviate the issues. If you are a perfectionist with your city construction you will likely get frustrated.

Current Pet Peeves:
- Sometimes editing a line will un-select the line from the line editing menu.
- Sometimes upgrading a vehicle will delete the vehicle from the line instead (Perhaps when a depot is not available to that line?)

Feature Wishes:
- Ability to place many tracks / roads side by side at the same time.",1577487300,1577594238,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,274,3,4583,0,3247,1578005154

It's generally a good game but I honestly couldn't recommend it because it's almost exactly the same game as the original Transport Fever which you can probably pick up with a decent discount.

The good... it's Transport fever, the graphics have been improved, the stations are configurable and can be mixed, the maps feel a bit larger. The campaign is generally well done but a bit easy, there are a few frustrating bits where it's no clear what you're supposed to do to complete the challenge.

The bad... all of the user interface awkwardness that was in Transport Fever is still there, you'll be getting a serious index finger workout from the amount of clicking you'll be doing. There's a complete lack of information about what things do. Cities still only take two resources, can't grow very large and it's not really clear how they grow. Transport within cities is still a mess. There's almost nothing new in the game, just buy Transport Fever. Did I mention there's a lack of information and you'll be doing a lot of clicking. There are weird issues in the interface, I just somehow managed to assign all my vehicles to a single tram line. The game crashes occasionally.

I can play TF1 on max settings with the largest maps and be perfectly fine at 60+ fps. The tutorials will load just fine (due to the small amount of assets on screen I'm guessing), but when I load a sandbox game, it will take a good 5 minutes to load the map. It will then take another 2 or so minutes to do a ""first time compression"" on the map. Once it loads, it will be very slow which is normal when first loading large maps. However, it does not stop being slow and my memory utilization shoots up to around 90% with only Spotify and Discord running in the background.

25,Transport Fever 2,60569028,english,"TpF2 improves on the formula in almost every way, with a lot of changes that seem intuitive at first but are a lot deeper than I first thought. One steady theme of Urban Games has been their gameplay that doesn't fit conventional expectations, and this is true for TpF2. Population growth is a lot more rewarding, passenger trains are potentially a lot more profitable, freight is still tricky but definitely worth the effort. 

At first, I thought it was too easy, even on hard mode. Then as I got fifty years into the game I started to see where mid- and late-game challenges arrived in unexpected ways. So while the start is slow but steady as always, the real challenges arrive as you attempt to fill up more of the map. Really appreciate what has been done here.

And of course finally the UI has improved considerably, with easier access to data, and the much-demanded line and vehicle upgrade improvements. It's incredible to think of the pains we used to go to to update vehicles. It is so easy (albeit slightly buggy) to upgrade all vehicles now, as well as stations! And while there are minor bugs in this area, they're only inconvenient (disappearing cargo, mostly) and none are game-breaking.

So bravo! Easily the best launch of their three games, and based on the track record of improvements over time, I can't wait to see how this looks in a year or two.

The 88 hours I have are on a single map that I designed to my first. I love the map builder. It grants the player some pretty good options to help themselves change the map and create their own level of challenge. 

I only ever watched the first Transport Fever from the likes of Colonel Failure, so I learned much of the basics of playing from there. I pretty much jumped straight into Freeplay because of this prior knowledge. This was both a good thing and a detriment due to the changes to the cargo system and building system implemented in the game. However, the changes made cargo easier to get going and scale, plus it is much more predictable than from what I experienced from watching the first game.  I love how they fixed airplanes, allowing them to connect towns. I would say that there is a bit of an issue with how the planes queue. Airports can only get so big before you have planes doing missed approaches and go-arounds for no apparent reason. I which there was an ability to control the traffic in this regard maybe spacing limits or approach paths. Since planes will run into mountains, which kinda breaks the immersion. 

I have run into some bugs, such as screen flickering and the occasional crash, but I am sure these will be patched out over time.

Compared to the previous game, it is basically a mere, yet much needed improvement. The game pace is a bit faster thanks to the fact that the industries start to produce as soon as there's a line connected to them (in the previous game, it was necessary to wait a few in-game weeks before the industry would start producing). The interface is much improved, especially with the grayscale layout on the map when showing certain information like lines, building types, etc. Also feedbacks are better, which make it easier to understand what and why something is happening (like, for instance, the storage facility figures turning blue at some point with a tooltip explaining that it means that it has reached maximum capacity and is starting to lose goods). But the must is maybe the possibility to tweak your buildings; it is possible to increase the storage capacity, to customize your train station and, most of all, to mix cargo and passenger in the train station.

There are still some graphics performance issues, the same as in the first game: slowdowns when editing long train lines. It is still playable, but you can feel the frame rate drops. And there are still some bugs though, but it is forgivable considering the game is from a small studio and these bugs are not very problematic. For instance, there is a bug when replacing a vehicle for instance, you just need to be careful to click on the new vehicle or the selected vehaicle will be deleted. While no bug is ever welcome, the ones I encountered didn't prevent me from having a good time. I simply hope they'll be quick to react and fix them sooner than later.

Today I bought it. I am playing it. And I am thinking: Nice DLC for Cities Skylines 2. 

Dont get me wrong please. Transport 2 and Cities 2 together might me something awesome. Beyond imagination. 

Transport 2 alone is just boring. Im sorry guys. It looks nice but it is just transport 1 with few upgrades. 

I am 40 years old stupid!!! guy who just expect more from tycoon games. 

Meet guys from Cities... talk. Dont be assholes full of fullish pride. Be both humble. Please do create together. And your job might be awesome.

Im sorry if I made you upset or sorry or sad. I dont want to. I want you and me have fun. I can see you can do nice game. But it is not enough today. You need to create special kind of a game. Guys from Cities created something special for me and for many others.  Do SPECIAL. Not just fine.

I will buy whatever you create just to support. But opportunities are awesome. 

Stupid truck guy.

PS. I really miss, lets say oldschool tycoon games and there is no so much around, so after buying this one I play it. It is not kinda: I love this game, cant stop playing type of fascination. Its kinda I really want to try it as I like tycoons and maybe I cant see depth.

So I spent some time trying things. And I still find it boring, as waiting time for results is.... well, just boring to see it all. But you can invite your child to see whats going on around and during boring waiting time enjoy graphics etc. People here really are alive. Going from HOME to SHOPPING to WORK etc..  Awesome.

My point is... its a nice game. I really enjoy planning (as I love planning) and I really enjoy the game. Still think it is a great DLC for Cities Skylines 2, as I miss this transport kind of a game in Cities. I love the way cities evolve. Get bigger. But it is still kinda not a game i LOVE.

If you want a virtual HO set to make complex routes and interchanges, and like a European setting, go for it.

To delve further into those two points, there is very little on the business side of things here. Even on the hardest difficulty its very easy to amass billions of dollars. There are no competitors. There are no property rights. You don't have to pay for property and you can happily bulldoze a whole city. The price to remove buildings is a little higher, but when you have billions of dollars, who cares? There's no contracts to move anything. The industries and cities sit there silently without requests or demands.
There's no 'station city' concept where you can build retail or hotels or make real estate that you purchased earlier high in value by making an attractive transport center. 
It is very disappointing that it does not even reach the depth of vanilla TTD.

The second point is that all of the assets right now are European despite the marketing information discussing an American and Asian region. The only thing unique are the city names, and the available trains. The buildings, people, and vegetation are the same. The Asian trains are very weak as well, with only Russian trains and a couple Chinese trains thrown in. There's some shinkansen, but it feels very weird to use them when all the local trains are Russian, on a desert mesa map out of Arizona.

Nice graphics with quite good detail, which gives you the feeling of emersion into a life-like simulation. Like passengers sitting on the train carriage, talking, having a meal. People look and walk like people, horses walk like horses, and car and train detail is just amazing. It's beautiful, and non-surprisingly you see the ""train ride"" videos on YouTube so nice it is. The water looks amazing, terrain is very detailed with ability to change every aspect and it is respond to every action, like placing a road, or raising a hill.

The goal of the game is to build and optimise transportation network, and it is pretty fun. You have variety of choices of transportation methods, goods and destinations, and it's a never ending sequence of optimisation and problem solving tasks that reward with profits.
I like the flexibility such as the ability to upgrade/downgrade the fleet, change modes of transportation, plan multi-step routes. And the nice twist of the changing times, that bring the new vehicles and depreciate the old ones.

Overall I've played 40 hours so far and enjoyed every minute of the game. At least, it's worth the money.

The only downside that I can see is that once you get to ""billions"" era, the game loses the challenge and becomes routine. And at times, even with all the flexibility, it seems linear. Hopefully this will be improved in future updates.

I've double checked my PCs specs and it is perfectly capable of running this game. I hope these errors will get corrected swiftly so I will be able to enjoy this game.

So, 1 & 1/2 weeks after release, a stability patch has been released which has made improvements. Still, though, the game will randomly crash after 40 mins to 1 hour.  Changing the autosave to a very frequent time is the only way to ensure you won't lose much in terms of gameplay.

Pros:
- If you like city builders and management you will most likely enjoy this game.
- Trains
- Great graphics
- Realistic timeline (watch the peoples clothes and vehicles evolve over the decades)
- Ability to play your own way, no need to follow a linear path with building up a company if you don't want to
- Very engaging
- Will keep you entertained for many hours at once
- Lots of vehicle detail and even a bit of history.
- You can pick from three different map themes and vehicle regions. (Europe, USA and Asia)

Cons:
- More stuttering than I was expecting when you have a lot going on at once
- Road building is ""finicky""
- Small amount of variety in the different industries spread across the map
- Towns/Cities are quite small (performance wise you probably don't want big cities anyway)

Gameplay is smooth , i only had 1 game crash in 45 hours played. 
 
Freeplay is where it's at , playing that is fun , the so-called career they have is kinda stupid IMO.

Late game gets kinda laggy , but then that's nothing new on this games history. all in all , i give it a solid 8/10.

22,Transport Fever 2,60398630,english,"I really wanted to like this game, but the lack of gameplay and the level of unpolishedness is just overwhelming. I find a few really good ideas in the game, some of them was in the previous version as well, but the lack of actual gameplay is just hidden by the really slow pace start.

Some PROs:
+ I love the music. This is one of the best part for me in this game. It really fits.
+ The modular station idea is just incredible.
+ The basic idea is good, but it was good back 20 years ago as well, nothing really more than that (sure, cities are growing by the product you transport there, and yes, you can upgrade industries by have more input/output, but nothing really fancy, these are just minor tweaks).

A lot of CONs:
- The lack of actual complexity just screams in your face after a few hours. Even hard mode is way too easy for anybody, who spent more than a couple of hours in any transportation game. On the other hand, easy mode is probably too hard for somebody, who never played this type of game. 
- They try to hide this lack of complexity with really slow-pace bound gameplay, especially in the beginning, and you hit a point in time when you can't even spend your money, you get so much. While in the beginning, sometimes (especially in hard mode), you need to just speedx3, and wait years to get the money you need to build one more stuff. It's just boring, and you can't do anything in that time. Once you have enough money, you are free to do whatever you want. But it is not hard to get to that point, only slow and boring.
- Even the largest map is smaller than we had back 20 years ago in these games. It's just funny how they call a 16*16km map ""very large"", when we are talking about trains going 200+ km/h, and even plains. What idiot had that idea to limit the game in a 16*16km grid? That's even smaller than a decent city nowadays.
- This small mapsize gets even funnier, when you have a high-end PC, and you still can't do more than 10 fps sometimes, and the autosave freezes your game for 10 seconds, or when you want to build, and you get seconds of stutter and freezes. And tho the game looks decent, it's far from the point it would need too much hardware. The game is insanely underoptimized. They should have not put on the market in its current state.

TLDR: slow, boring and very limited gameplay, lack of any kind of complexity, freezes and stutters all the time even on high-end PC.",1577118978,1577118978,FALSE,0,0,0.486177295,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,520,12,1595,0,1583,1600460265

I'm getting used to the new play after playing for 30 hours.  For those of you wondering why you can't tell the cars what type of goods to get, you do it from the line configuration.  As far as reconfiguring your consist, you can do it on the fly without having to send your train back to the depot.  If you want to add additional cars to your locomotive, send it out, and click on the ""reconfigure"" icon.  I never really used layers on the old TF (or even knew if it had different layers), but the different layers are very helpful. Missions are challenging, routes are easier to configure, aligning tracks is better.  I definitely recommend.  Oh, and as far as the narrator's accent I mentioned before, he uses that accent throughout the game - I just thought it was a really bad American accent after the first mission.  :)  Transport on!

------

Played the first mission of the game.  First impression is that it's about the same as the previous Transport Fever with a few additional features, such as cockpit view, environment (you can focus in on bears and see birds flying about), showing layers (where the residential, commercial, and industrial areas are) and probably other things that I haven't discovered yet.  Some of the nuisances carried over from the previous version of the game, such as not being able to align the buildings exactly the way you want to, and trains reversing unrealistically at the train stations.

Here's the deal. It took less than two weeks for a mod to come out which reverts that change. 

The graphics engine has been upgraded considerably. The game is stunningly beautiful. I've spent a considerable percentage of my play time just watching the onboard camera on vehicles on my lines. 
The campaign is actually very interesting in this iteration and I've enjoyed it quite a bit
The new terrain generation for Arid maps is fantastic looking and the all new Tropical generation manages to create beautiful and realistic island landscapes.
The new line manager, while it took a minute to get used to, is far more robust and feature rich making updates to existing vehicles and lines substantially easier than before.
Modular stations are a literal game changer if you're aesthetics conscious. 
The map editor is very well put together and powerful for authors

I could go on. There's a lot more but I think you get it. If you're skeptical about moving from TPF1 to TPF2 I can tell you with certainty it's worth the update and deserving of a separate release.

Now Transport Fever 2 is a game changer from the first 1 (let alone train fever). There is just too many things too list! But! They are all great improvements! Heck you can get a better start on hard mode too!

So going to list a few things off with the game.
* Can slow, fast forward, or out right pause the year so you can stay locked in a era.
* You can upgrade, change out, adjust, all vehicles and aircraft on the fly with a simple ease.
* Can easily adjust what cargo to load, how much of it, and unload with the new waypoint system.
* Interface is much nicer and easier to use.
* Much more micromanaging if you so wish.
* Configure your base station to suit your needs and customize (You can make some wonky / combined stations now).

The older game had a feature to automatically replace worn out vehicles when it was time. With this game introducing wear and tear, increasing emissions (noise and air pollution), and functionality it seems to clash with the older game's auto replace. Instead you have a maintenance factor, which could STILL use an auto replace.

There is also the option to place a company HQ although I have yet to see the advantage of this. Does it improve or detract from land values? Does having it in a particular town focus growth in that town or reduce the overhead in that town as HQ is closer to those routes?

55,Transport Fever 2,60338427,english,"Alright, 10 hours of total gameplay time, two days of ownership. What do I have to say about my new game? Well, to start off, a MASSIVE improvement over the old TpF. Sure, I had to upgrade my PC because it is so RAM heavy, but my goodness! was that worth it. 

[b] Map graphics [/b]
First off, the graphics are a surefire improvement over the old game because you finally are not left with either green or yellow-coloured land without features, and the new tropical setting looks sweet. Now with the map generator. Of course, in the old TpF you could pick the geography of your map and the time era with settings such as ""Flat"", ""Large"", ""1850"", etc. In this one, though, you first go to the map generator, and you have a small side screen which shows what the geography of your map will look like, which is pretty darn sweet. The next page is the continental theme and time era setting page, and here you can access your mods by hitting ""Custom"" and the button right next to it. 

[b] Gameplay [/b]
Now to the gameplay, which is a massive improvement over the old one. I have mostly screwed around with planes initially, and finally I am glad to say that planes aren't broken pieces of shit that nobody will use like they were in TpF1, and to add to that you have cargo variants, which I really like. I was actually also quite surprised by the Sherpa, which can be both used as a passenger and cargo plane - a feature I didn't know about. Heard the Ju 52 has a similar feature, which finally means planes have proper utility. Let's move back in time to the steam era, and what do I have to say? At least, the Ruskie locomotives are good lookers, which says something. (No dissing to you Americans! Just my 2 cents!) But Ruskie locos aside, the new smoke textures look great. They just aren't translucent circles with different colours, but rather actual smoke. This is a graphics improvement on many levels, aiding with immersion and similar. [i]Oh, and God Mode has basically been added as a stock mod included in-game[/i] (don't tell this anyone!). And there's a new emission mechanic in the game, so be sure to keep silent (literally)!

[b] Modular stations [/b]
Now, modular stations. This is probably the biggest addition to the Transport Fever series, as all stations beforehand (and still are now, only when you plonk one in) had to be configured by hitting a button and picking what layout you wanted. I have no problems with this system, however it can be a bit clumsy at times. Still I am surprised that Urban hasn't implemented curved stations as stock yet. Airports probably benefit the most, as you could build a passenger airport and implement a cargo station and vice versa, which in and of itself saves a lot of hassle that comes with building a second separate cargo airport. This feature actually also applies to every other station in-game, although I am not sure about the cargo harbour. You may still need to build a separate cargo harbour to use cargo ships.

[b] Conclusion [/b]
Now the campaign is something I haven't tested yet, and I am looking to test it in the near future. But for now, here's a (brief) conclusion. I have downed 1k+ hours into Transport Fever 1 (mostly thanks to mods, they're still a thing here), and now we have Transport Fever 2. This game, from my experience with TpF1, builds and improves on almost everything from the OG game. The only thing now is to implement curved stations into the game, and I am convinced this'll be the Transport Tycoon Deluxe of this age of video games. Solid 9/10, needs slight refinement, but otherwise great game.

There are plenty of other QoL issues and weirdness here and there, some of which was brought over from the first game, but if those things didn't bug you too much in the first game, then they won't bother you here.

3,Transport Fever 2,60272736,english,"So finally here it is, Transport Fever 2, I was hyped since I heard the message the first time from Tom the community manager from Urban games. Every preview they showed seemed to good to be true and now here it is.

So is it living up to the hype? Is it the revolutionairy sequel to Transport Fever 1?

To answer this question I have to talk about some aspects of the game which are until now kinda unpolished, some even seem rushed and unfinished; but there are also ton of improvements over the first game, so let's see.

The obvious thing is that mods made TF1 great, it was a nice enough game by itself, but the best experience came with shaping the game the way you like with mods from the unresting, talented moding community this franchise has. I'm fascinated by the fact that there are allready this many, allready gamechanging mods for TF2 out there, but as it is, it's only the beginning. TF 2 will ripe like a nice wine over time, as there will be more and more mods available.

[b] Economy: [/b]


a lot of people complain about it. ""No new production chains!"" ""Only 2 recources demanded by cities ! "" ""Raw material producers are always producing 100% making the game too easy! ""So, there is a lot of hate out there. I gave this a lot of thought and came to the conclusion that they actually made a pretty good job. Raw material producers, that are always producing sure make the game less difficult, cities that only demand certain cargo make it harder on the other side.
You have to plan your transport routes all over the map to effeciently get the resources to where they are needed, clever! I found myself often thinking how to make the next steps in my network for a long time, and it made a lot of fun. 
Why no new production chains? I guess they had to keep the game balanced and it's allready a bit crowded with industries. Anyway, there will be plenty of mods for this matter in the future.

There are even some new ways to transport stuff, cargo airplanes and ships that actually work and they look really awesome. Thats a BIG step coming from TF1, and I really apreciate it. Only complain I have here is that cargo capacity of Airport terminals and ship docks is not increasable, meaning, you loose some cargo because of overfilled stations, very frustrating! It's not often a problem if you are using ships, but for airplanes it's kinda redicolous at the moment.

[b] Stations: [/b]


probably the most spectacular anouncement was that there will be modular trainstations. You can now adjust them as you play threw time, making them bigger, smaller, make two platforms for 2 small trains instead of one, or combine cargo and passengerstation in one building. It was really fun experimenting with this feature, but also tedious at times, because ""modular"" means you have to delete, create every module of the station seperately, if you make adjustments to your network or enter a new time era with new station buildings and platforms you have to spend a lot of time editing your stations. At least upgrading your station to the current era should be a build in feature. 

[b] Vehicle maintenance (emissions): [/b]


This is a big change to Transport Fever 1 as well. Vehicles will age as we know it from TF1 but they will not cost you more money as they age, instead they will have increased emissions. Emissions are a new game mechanic introduced in TF2, more emissions near the residential areas of cities will have a negative impact on city growth.
The automatic replacement feature from TF1 is no more, but instead, we can increase the maintenance cost of vehicles to restore their condition, making replacement obsolete and saving you a lot of work, thanks Urban games. 

""But no increasing costs, isn't it going to be much less difficult that way?"" you might think, and yes, it is. After all I allready said about economy and vehicles you can conclude that this game is easy compared to TF1. Is it really that important? That depends on how you play the game. If you want it to be challenging and hardcore you have to depend on the mods, i allready saw some nice ones like ""Oil king"" and a mod that let's you pay for cargo space.

[b] Changing of timeflow: [/b]


You can now decide how fast time is progressing, that's just awesome. I have only love for this feature and it changed the way i play the game significantly.

[b] City growth and traffic: [/b]

City growth is now completly transparent and gives new opportunities to plan your lanes, you have to keep town needs and emissions in mind and deliver the cargo the city demands, it works great. But I have to say city growth feels kinda ""less"". They don't get as big anymore.
I'm still unsure about traffic, and that might be because i haven't had a lot of traffic. With my game I'm in year 1986 now, and I'm at 100~ hours in game and I don't really have a lot of traffic on my map. Maybe it will change in the upcoming years or they nerved it, i can remember how crowded my streets became in TF1 on larger maps, holy moly, that was a mess. I never experienced this in TF2, but this can have many reasons, for example that I planned and build my passenger network from 1850 on and build a nice highway connection threw the map. IDK.

[b] Graphics: [/b]

It's not the prettiest game arround, but on the other hand it's a pretty big game with big maps and a lot going on, so you have to balance this out. Obviously it's a big improvement to TF1 and I really like the new style.

[b] My conclusion: [/b]


This are all the major impressions I had so far with this game and I do recommend it. For new players as well, as for TF1 players. As i said, it will take time until this game will have the mod variety of TF1 but it's allready a great game. It's like a raw diamond, and if you wait for a little it will shine.

Thanks in advance to all moders and Urban games for making this possbile, and i hope for lots of new fixes, content and improvements in the upcoming months.

If you, dear reader, are a friend of trains, transportation, managing of cargo chains or you just want to build something beautiful without any challenge, this game is for you. You can adjust so many settings, and download mods as they come.

2 Love the way you can set up most lines without too much of a learning curve

Dont like the fact that there is no apparent competition, which make it less of a game and more of a simple simulation whereas in TM of old you had the pressure on  you to perform.    

Dont like the tutorial style of the Campaign game - this is too juvenile and does not actually show you which buttons to press.    This leads to much repetitive trial and error until you get it right.

48,Transport Fever 2,60215947,english,"Transport Fever is a game you sit down to play for a few hours and suddenly the sun has risen.

I thoroughly enjoyed the first iteration of the franchise and I hadn't expected a second iteration so soon after discovering the first game.

If you haven't played the first game it would be worth picking up as it is cheaper and is a solid game in its own right, I would highly recommend picking it up first to enjoy everything the first one has to offer.

If you have played the first Transport Fever or you are a fan of similar games (Factorio is a great comparison for a game that isn't a usual simulation tycoon game) This is a must have.

It looks amazing, and it is well optimised. I had no issues playing on my system and I am running a i7/16GB RAM/GTX 970 rig.

Detail is excellent the vehicle models are lovingly made with insane attention to detail, the scenery is a brilliant backdrop for you to create your transport network.

Other reviews cover the game in excellent detail and I would recommend looking through them or finding a video review, a review for the first Transport Fever would outline the game well and it would carry on to the second, the second is a refreshing update and sticks to the core gameplay values.

I believe there are a few things that need to be added to this game through FREE Updates.

Changing Vehicle colours. The colour selection is lacking and overpowering. The colours that you can change are overpowering.
You should be able to change each wagon/section of the vehicle independently, I don’t want every wagon to be the exact match I want some odd coloured wagons for some realism.

Add a few more resources, I like the selection but just a few more for variety would be great, perhaps add some more by products to make managing everything slightly more difficult.

The modular additions to platforms should allow them to be added as a stop, for example: If I add a cargo bay to my platform, I should be able to set that as a stop on my road vehicle lines.

The game is, as it stands, unplayable. Until this problem is fixed, I will not recommend this game.

80,Transport Fever 2,59851738,english,"I enjoyed the original, but some of the new bits and bobs just don't do it.
1) The removal of Unload Only in the line manager for stations causes my truck lines to bunch up at stations for no reason except that the trucks are waiting to be filled, on a line where they're not meant to be filled.
2) The adjustment of production ratios. Normally I would build a line where trucks go from plant to plant to plant etc and finally to town. But now, where one log used to make one plank but now one plank requires two log, means that lines must be separated between source to first plant, and first plant to the rest, thus adding to truck station woes.
3) It's a lot harder to turn a profit in the early years. While this is not inherently bad, extra maintenance costs combined with loan interest can really kill you if you don't start with a profitable line immediately.
4) Freight lines have become less complex. We used to have to connect multiple sources for something as complex as plastic, but now we only need oil. While some of the freight changes are nice, others seem out of place
5) This is one of the big ones. It's incredibly hard to justify to yourself playing this game when you make what seems like a profitable line, just to be whacked out of profit by half of your maintenance costs. Even in the previous game the ratio between maintenance cycles and distance covered by vehicles wasn't great; now it's abysmal.
6) There's not much new. I was hoping to see more variety in freight types and vanilla vehicles, no such luck whatsoever",1576348322,1576856355,FALSE,1,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,254,6,4311,0,869,1599665083

This game is a good start to be a updated, modern successor to 'Transport Tycoon Deluxe'. The graphics and the new station-placementfeatures are absolutely wonderful.
I played OPEN TTD a lot, and recently again. Transport Fever 2 needs a lot of polishing and the most important feature would be a coop multiplayer mode for at least free play. (like the king in its genre: open TTD)


The campaign has its moments but in a few missions there is nothing to do (omg Paris-mission 7), the quest and sidequests are boring, restricting your own playstyle and its way to easy. You simply have to much money and never have to think about earning some... 
And goals like 'deliver 40 tons of oil to a city' is simply bad design; a train with 10 wagons holds like 90 tons of oil... (please increase the amount of wares transported and reduce the profit - it feels wrong in its current state)


Please update and polish this game further, it is just a few grand patches and maybe 1, 2 addons (dlc) away from being a 10 out of 10! Keep up the wonderful work,

13,Transport Fever 2,60139684,english,"Unrefined gem.

My perspective: casual OpenTTD player. Skipped previous games from this dev. Focused on gameplay and tycoon side of things (not a train junkie etc.).

Positives:
- Amazing graphics for this type of game (with familiar vehicles from Asia/Russia, America or Europe). You can actually see every passenger in vehicles and every unit of cargo on platforms!
- I like the art-style approach in this game, unlike most modern games. It's a perfect balance between over-saturated slightly ""cartoonish"" style and grim&dull realistic representation of the world. Just like a modern version of good old TT.
- Amazing passenger agent system where you can track every single person as he travels to/from work or shopping, even between cities etc.
- Cargo supply/demand system similar to Cargodist in OTTD. Here it has very clearly designed mechanics and works very well.
- A lot of the familiar features from TT (though some stuff is simplified-away).
- Finally a full-blown campaign (18 missions, 1-3 hours each) and not *just* a random game.
- Covers the history of transportation from 1850 to 2000 (just the way I've always wanted in OTTD).

Negatives:
- Track/road laying is tedious (a lot of extra clicks, can't automatically follow the terrain elevation).
- A lot of small/medium usability issues with UI (bugs, illogical/inefficient workflows, etc.).
- No vehicle maintenance/breakdowns mechanics from TT. Instead you have an ""emissions"" mechanic. I liked having to send my vehicles to maintenance on their schedule in TTD, it gives extra challenge etc.
- Primary industries produce always the same amount. You can ""upgrade"" secondary industries by efficiently supplying them and their consumers, but there's no random element like in TTD where some industries produce better yields etc. which gave some more variety. Having the same amounts of cargo everywhere might be dull.
- Performance issues (objects like trees eat way too much frame time etc.).
- Can't use modifier keys for hotkeys, and you need to use a lot of them!
- Campaign missions are not challenging at all. Most tasks are trivial. Few hard tasks have obvious exploits to easily achieve them not the way the game suggested. Overall it's not that bad and is entertaining for me.

22,Transport Fever 2,60126843,english,"About 20 hours in and I have a few thoughts on the game. First, so you know where I'm coming from, I have never played the original Transport Fever. I also have no played things like Train Simulator or many other ""transport"" type games. The closest I get is the old school Sid Meier's games or tycoon games. I've played (and loved) Factorio.

Let's start off with the bad:
The cities are a little underwhelming in size (though they do grow, but I'm not sure yet just how much).
The campaign seems like just a *very* long winded tutorial. I stopped after a few episodes because it felt like extended hand holding that I didn't want to waste time on.
There are times you will think something is broken, but it's not. You just haven't connected your lines up properly (this comes with time, and you will get *very* good at it). 
The game is ""too easy"" as far as money is concerned. After a couple hours you'll have figured out how to make sure you're always netting positive.

The pros:
The game is beautiful. It's fun to just look around the map at your creations ticking away.
It's a lot of fun. Easy or not, there's something pleasing about hooking up transport lines successfully and watching the money roll in.
There's a variety of transport types. There are three ""cultures"" from 1850 to modern, so there's a lot of different vehicles to play around with (planes, trains and automobiles). 
The map generator works pretty well (though there is a distinct lack of challenging scenarios).

The other stuff:
There is no ""enemy"" AI. Do not expect to be competing against an AI. This game is just about connecting logistics around a reasonably good sized map.  
There are no hand crafted scenarios outside of the campaign (which best I can tell is just a really long tutorial). 
The game is pretty ""easy"" in that once you know what you're doing, it's almost hard to do anything wrong. You will make money doing almost anything as long as there is supply on one side and demand on the other. This could be as seemingly stupid as flying wood across a map to supply a lumber yard and then flying that lumber back across, despite there being a forest and lumber yard directly next to your end destination. 

Overall the game is fun. For the price, it's worth it. I'm 22 hours in and plan on putting in a good few more. That comes out to ~1.6 USD per hour of fulfilling entertainment so far. A relatively reasonable price if you ask me.",1576776009,1576776009,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,616,24,4089,0,1325,1598027179

PROS:
The user interface has been improved a lot, by adopting the modern flatten flavor of icons and aggregating vehicle/line management function in a more user friendly panel and by intuitive instructions in case of any problem with your empire. The developers must have spent tremendous effort in bringing the player such an abundant choice of transport vehicles from all over the world ranging from the steam era to the latest Fuxing EMU train. As a Chinese player i'm really delighted by that.
The graphics have been brought to a extraordinary level, benefiting from exploiting the GPU capability of dynamic lighting, blurring etc. 

CONS:
1. Player can neither select vehicles by age nor select lines by cargo type in the line management panel
2. When editing a specific line, the map still renders paths of other lines.

its a graphically nice game as TPF1 , but for me i think i tend on tpf1 color pallet looks more smooth and simple for me on my opinion , well this is not what im talking about here anyway , the real pain i this game it got disadvantages from TPF1 , mostly all about vehicle management , tpf1 was better than this , i hope if devs resume and add missing things that was available in tpf1 to here .
 


anyway if you want to know details about the disadvantages , here what i found  :-

auto replace is no longer available here , you have to manually click , and for worse situation , it might replace some and ignore without notification cus of high cost that your balance

old vehicles no longer will be highlighted 

2 trains can no longer be merged , if you wana add more wagons , your train should be in depot and you can't shift carts or wagons from train 1 to train 2

anyway don't get me wrong , its not a bad game but its about critical management features that might affect at your gaming experience , i hope devs add back these things soon

---------------------------------------------------------------

update , why change to recommend : -
after spending more time with this game , i can confirm the ui controls on TPF1 was little better than this one because of free moving windows , while here you might waste more time to do things that was easier before , and i also notice the ui windows take a big place on the screen while it can be more compact , and there is alot of empty areas on the ui window that covers the screen ,  but despite of that , i can understand game mechanics got some changes , there are nice things too i didn't mentioned , map editing is better than before , on tpf1 when you dig the landscape , you can't make water canals that goes through the are the you digged , but now its possible and open more navigable areas , i just changed to recommend because of some really good things are added as easy map generating with towns and streets , with in few mins you can create a full map with industries and streets , and the most nice add i see in my opinion  is time speed change , you can play at normal X 0.25 speed for longer game age i believe and i think the old vehicles will be more useful , and its also balanced and adjusted the penalties as running costs and other stuff to match the time speed , they done good regard that stuff , just because of these ( esp on time speed change ) , i see its little better than tpf1 , but i hope they continue to update this game to be more better",1576095420,1576691291,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,89,15,6859,0,421,1598372796

[b]Two cargo per town[/b]
I think the best change is the switch to a two cargo per town system. Some people have called it a dumb-down, but I see it as a simplification that actually adds more complexity, because you need to think about the actual destination of the products.

[b]Emissions[/b]
Emissions is a new system in which heavy traffic has a negative effect on city growth. On itself it's okay, something about it annoys me, but that actually has to do with something else.

[b]City growth[/b]
What I find really disappointing about TF2 so far is the city's maximum size, and the even more limited size of a lot of towns. I want to have large cities, because I also want to have innercity transportation networks that actually make sense, and I want to have the feeling that my transport networks are really driving development forward.

[b]Lines interface[/b]
There are basically 3 interfaces about lines. The line manager, the vehicle manager, and the lines overview (button on the lower right). I don't see why they didn't merge at least the first two interfaces. Now I find myself constantly switching between these windows for basically doing 1 task.

[b]Graphics[/b]
The graphics are really beautiful.

[b]The El Dorado of TF2[/b]

83,Transport Fever 2,60058835,english,"This game, i was slightly sceptical about, seeing the trailer i was a bit disappointed that they decided to not expand upon Transport Fever 1, and I continued to be disappointed, until I watched the game-play video when it released, and my opinion went polar opposite, I was ecstatic about the graphics changes, the quality of life, and I don't know how they did it, but it feels like they have created something entirely unique from the Train Fever and Transport Fever 1.

There are only two things that I don't like:

Why are there not any lower settings than MEDIUM for terrain and shadows, like, what? I have a pretty shitty system, and I wish there was more opportunity for people with worse systems (me and a lot of others) to have a relatively smooth and non stuttering game. Having an option to turn off shadows would EASILY give people 60 FPS and barely any stutter. I know that people might just say, 'hAh WeLl GeT a BeTtEr SyStEm!'. Well, I am in school and I don't have a job, and I have better stuff to spend money on.

The other thing about the game, which isn't actually bad, it's just a personal preference that I believe a lot of people want to. But having multiplayer in Transport Fever 2 would make this game an 11/10. No joke, in my eyes, the Transport Fever series is a direct successor to the classic OpenTTD game (if you don't know what it is, watch the Yogscast play it or Jschlatt). Having multiplayer, whether it be cooperating to maximise efficiency in your transport empire, or it being competing to gain the favour of towns and push your rivals away from the profitable industries and cities.

The best things about Transport Fever 2:

- A blast watching your vehicles travel the lands
- Watching the towns grow after you have laid plenty of infrastructure
- Seeing the evolution of your railways and city routes
- Hundreds of vehicles that in my eyes, can never get old
- A genuinely satisfying experience throughout all portions of the game

If you haven't played TF1 then it is a good game, but not the sort of game you can dip into -  which can be a good thing,    It is nice to have a immersive game in your own game catalogue.
If you have TF1 then it is basically the same except for the improved graphics, no learning curve whatsoever!
It seems to run quicker and with less glitches.
PROs
* Good Graphics
* Nice game play.
* Nice music again.
* A Good Challenge.
* Lots of fun and options.
CONS
* Unfeasibly long time to load - go have a cup of tea, play another quick game, go write a review - Haha!   Obviously loading from an SSD improves loading time a little.
* If it takes so long to load - how come it takes a nano-second to unload???  (lol)
* Why does reloading a gameplay involve load the WHOLE game???  
* A CTRL-Z button would be nice, one accidental click/build and it could cost you the game while money is tight..
* Travel on a train but without any points or level crossing rumble which is weird.  This is the sort of improvement one would expect in 'the improved new version'.
* .. see above.  Very little time and effort has been spent creating a better game in V2.

You can no longer switch train cars around , now its just buy and sell. 
They made the Missions the tutorial, so if you play the game first and then decide to play the missions you will have to deal with them explaining things you already know.
The game seams as if it was designed for children. In the missions if you successfully place a building where they tell you to put it you get a clapping sound and a Task Completed notice. You feel like your in grammer school and are getting rewarded for a minor accomplishment.
Like Transport Fever the stations aren't capable of prioritizing trains that are waiting for products so your train will just sit there while all the products get loaded on the other platforms.
They made the train car cost ridiculously expensive. In 1850 you can buy a steam engine for $250,000 but the 14 person passenger car cost $400.000.  add in the high maintenance costs and you end up with low profits which results in it taking way to long to make any money to expand with.
The game runs way to slow. It seems like the highest speed (3) in this game is less than the speed of the 2 setting in Transport Fever. This results in the player doing a lot of staring and waiting. 
These are just some of the things i'm annoyed with.

Cargo planes are added, which is fantastic. The models look amazing, and the details are a ton of fun to check out.

What bothers me is the silly debt cap that they still have. When you are starting with the trains, and each train easy is like 10 mill each, you need a shitload of cash to put up a few lines. With the debt cap this will take longer time than it should have.

Quite a few improvements versus the original Transport Fever, including custom stations, a much better economic model that is a lot more intuitive, and better graphics.  I find this far superior to Railway Empires or any similar game.  

The custom stations are terrific and I can never go back to TF1 after having them.  You can easily make any road depot, train station, airport, or harbor accept passengers or freight and add more terminals as needed.  It's modular so you can always add more as you need it.  

I personally like the new economic model.  It makes it much easier to determine what is causing cities to grow and your lines are much less likely to wildly change their production.  This means much more reliable production chains which can thereby be made more elaborate.      

The only downside compared to Railway Empires or the Sid Railroads series is that there are no AI opponents.  For me, that's not an issue (for instance, there are also no AI oppents in Cities Skylines).

TF2 is essentially a re-skin and rebalance of TF1 with many improvements to graphics, vehicle sets and playability.

However, the one key issue with TF1 was with optimization, where the game would stutter and demand too many system resources on even average sized maps.

TF2 is the same, if not worse. Severe lag, performance issues and game crashing is present once the transport system gets large enough (not very large in reality).

This game is a step backwards for those like me who just want to build an extensive network without lag and stutter.... It's all i ask.",1576554166,1576554166,FALSE,3,0,0.523809552,1,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,166,3,12145,275,2637,1602083276

New:
- Major graphics overhaul
- Great career mode to play through
- New country types
- Improved UI
- Modular stations
- Better functioning boat and airplane AI
- New way to manage vehicles and lines

Still the same that I wished was new:
- The railroad tracks look really fragile
- The railroad tracks look much less realistic then the environment
- Railroads do no bank, making trains fly through curves unrealistically
- Lack of a proper modding documentation

The simple truth about this un-complex game is - the money is in the distance. Use the river, find two businesses at both ends, they don't have to be next to the river, just close so you can deliver with 20 cars large ammounts to the port. Buy a ship. And watch money flowing in.... the game is beaten on 1852 and its only about expansion.

The plus is for the graphics. If it was 2D map or isometric you could run in the browser. 

All in all it is very simplified variation on immortal Transport Tycoon by MicroProse which has so much bigger maps, so much higher level of complexity and it was running on DOS in 1994 when it was released. 

Advice: if you want true Transport Fever get yourself OpenTTD - its free and it so much better.

There are still elements that I would consider to be missing from a logistics game - for example road vehicles still can't overtake anything that moves slower than they do (so you have to upgrade them all on a route otherwise they'll just get stuck behind the slowest). Worse though, is that trains using the same line cannot be made to pass each other which means you must use the same trains/config or risk not getting the most out of the faster train. You can frig this by using separate lines and forcing routes that go onto different parallel tracks - but I would rather see a routing system that will understand multiple ways to get to the destination and follow a path with open signals if there is one available when the first route is blocked.

Pros -
It looks an awful lot better than TF1. 
Lines and industries seem cleverer than they used to be. Much easier to establish a multi stage supply chain (different modes of transport) than it ever used to be in TF1.
Industries don't have a habit of forgetting you exist like they used to. 
UI is clearer (to me anyway) and available info is better in game
The ability to pause the game year while still playing is lovely. 
Modular stations are a brilliant new feature. 
New map generation allows for decent tinkering before you begin. 

Cons - 
Building bridges over railways still a nightmare. 
Cities only ever accept two products plus passengers as opposed to the 6 plus passengers of TF1. Makes it very easy to supply and grow a city with minimal effort, unnecessary simplicity.
In fact the entire economy system is simple and arbitrary. 
New vehicle management system is a step backwards and not very instinctive. It's about condition rather than age and how it works or impacts the game isn't obvious. 
Despite modders having added curved stations to TF1 the devs still don't support them. 
New ""Island"" map setting tied to Asian environment for some arbitrary reason. 

In short, did you enjoy Transport Fever and Train Fever? Then you'll enjoy this. 
Looking for a fun network builder? You'll enjoy this. 
Looking for a challenging logistics tycoon? You might be disappointed.

I would also highly recommend  this game to anyone that is interested in the old tycoon management style of game like Railroad Tycoon, TTD etc as it will be right up your alley as this is basically a virtual train set.... The campaign is challenging at the later stages and will leave you scratching your head in bemusement trying to figure out how to meet all the objectives as quickly and cheaply as humanly possible. However this is no real story or motivation in the Free Play mode other than to generate more profit then Disney does each year abusing the Star War franchise. While I admit that doesn't sound that appealing to many, it was this mode that I enjoyed the most and being free to create my transport however I see fit. I actually found it quite liberating when I could go outside the normal game and play about with the sandbox mode enabled (safe to say some of the towns got rather large).

- The game play is fairly easy to pick up, but there is a learning curve that's not difficult to overcome. The campaign missions help teach the basics.
- The UI is simplistic yet very detailed. For example, with a simple click you can  see the conditions of your vehicles at a glance and determine if they need to be replaced.
- The problems I've encountered so far are minimal. For example, It would be nice if there was an auto replace feature for the vehicles because, as your transportation empire grows, managing all your vehicles and keeping them in good condition can become a little overwhelming.
- If there is anything about this game that needs improvement, I would say the in-game music. Worst soundtrack ever. Thank God for Pandora. The Mariachi music in mission three cracked me up. Then it just became annoying.

97,Transport Fever 2,59708393,english,"YES! YES! YES! I absolutely LOVE Transport Fever 2, for many reasons that I will add to this review after I have fulfiled my binge play of this beautiful successor to Transport Fever.

Ok still binge playing but wanted to add a few things to this review...

The best pre-purchase I have made since pre-purchasing the original Transport Fever!

THE MAP TOOL! is fantastic. It is what Create-a-World was to Sims 3! (Simmers will get that reference). I can now create my own very precise and custom maps in the game without having to use 3rd party software and tools. That makes this game worth its weight in gold for me personally. It is what I wished for most and Urban games delivered!
The totally modifiable terrain including COASTLINES is a BIG plus.
The modular stations are fantastic and the fact that I can now combine passenger and cargo in one station is sublime.
The graphics are stunning.
The factories, farms, manufacturing buildings have far more detail and better animations.
The People are a lot better and their animations a lot more ""natural"".
The variation in biomes is fantastic.
The game loads a heck of a lot faster than TF1 did (even before it got weighed down with mods).
Runs very smoothly so far.
There seems to be a lot more detail in every aspect of the environment.
Lots more info easily accessible about, vehicles, lines, towns, industries etcetera.
Better movable ride-along camera.
Not having every product demanded by every town does add more challenge to deciding where and how to ship goods and materials.
The new highlighting is a LOT more visible. Much easier to see catchment areas and zones.
The new UI does take a bit of getting used to and a few things do not feel as ""intuitive"" as they might be. It is very easy for example to buy the wrong, train, carriage, truck for example BUT after a lot more practice it will fade.
Already the fantastic modding community are porting over mods from TF1 (hoping my favourite Multiple Units will be converted soon.

So YES I absolutely recommend this game especially to fans of the genre!

0,Transport Fever 2,59724029,english,"I have played through 3 of the  quest scenarios, and about 15 hours on a frustrating ""free"" game, and what a huge disappointment. The only positive reviews you will see are from people who have not played the first one. I have about 200 hours on TF1 and nearly all the achievements. I loved it and was so looking forward to 2. The graphics and all the colours on 2 are kind of faded. You really have to look carefully to see the towns zones. And now you have to first create a line and then you can assign vehicles to it. In 1 it was all in one go. The interfaces coming up are dull and dark grey, with no personality. The graphics are barely better than 1. The towns now need just two random resources. This is so unrealistic.  I just get the feeling that these guys thought. ""Ah well - got to make a sequel - lets up the graphics a bit and see how we can twiddle a bit with the controls."" What any gamer wants from a sequel is some surprise, something new that makes you think - wow that's nice!  I am sad - yes I am. Especially as I bought the first on a special and felt inspired to pay proper money for the second version.
O my goodness... - there is no more auto replacement of vehicles at its retirement age. This means that  you now either have to replace individually, or the whole line at once. The info screen where you can see the age of each vehicle in a row, is not the same as the replacement screen. On the replacement screen, no age appears.... which means you will have to look at the numbers of the vehicles on the one screen where you can see their age., then either write it down, or remember, then go to the replacement screen and tick the correct ones you wish to replace... Why on earth would they change a system that worked so intuitively, to these cumbersome bland grey screens? Well - because it is an expansion old chap! We can't have you thinking we did nothing! I might make a video of this on that tube thing...

The AI at any farm or industry just doesn t work. Try building one truck station with more than on line... There is no sense in the way it is setup. The old way of 5 stuff in, 5 stuff out was much better. You have no control on which line the produce is placed for transport, and there seems no logic in the way it is done. Town growth is just stupid. I have Dallas in 1990 with 435 residents! That is after I have managed to supply it with goods and passenger transport for 50 years. But the city almost looks like a metropolis! 

It seems that the specific two commodities any town needs, is almost impossible to get to them - until later in the game with faster road vehicles. A cart can take years to eventually get 4 units to the town. TF1 has its problems, but it pales in comparison to all the mistakes in TF2",1576173102,1576485806,FALSE,4,0,0.516483545,1,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,314,7,5945,0,240,1594974903

- Good variation of vehicles 
- The Map and the game looks amazing
- Air-travel is now awesome
- On islands, boats are also awesome
- You get nice info about things like your assets, and your value

The ,,need to work on""
- On mid to endgame building or modifying a train station (on the module parts) takes a while
- It could use a few new industries 
- Air-Travel, especially traffic on taxi ways need to be improved as airplanes sometimes land when another airplane it's crossing the airfield
- A bigger map would be cool (the ,,experimental map thingy from TF1""
- Auto-replace vehicles is missing

44,Transport Fever 2,59928119,english,"I'll just say it.  I am enjoying TF2.  I'm enjoying it quite a bit.  While it boasts a number of improvements over its predecessor, I can't help but feel like a good number of the changes were more ""lateral"" in that they alter the gameplay and functionality from TF1, but don't necessarily deliver tangible improvements or enhancements.  

 For example, I don't mind the changes made to vehicle management;
- Vehicles still age, but the mechanic that impacts the game is their ""emissions"" which can be reduced with increased maintenance.
- There are still depots, but we no longer have the ability to ""store"" equipment, or move cars/locomotives from one train to another.
- You can easily now select multiple vehicles to apply actions against.  I like this especially when you want to upgrade vehicles but don't need replacements on a 1 to 1 ratio.  In the past, that meant sending individual vehicles to the depot, now it's a lot faster.

I don't necessarily dislike this new overall feel, but can't help but feel like it doesn't really represent a great leap forward from TF1.  Is it better system?  Maybe a little bit, but certainly not a ""deal maker"".

Also, I like that the cargo system no longer has a 1 to 1 relationship in supply/demand in the sense that you now must draw on multiple primary industries to get production at secondary and tertiary to their upper levels.  I'm not however sold on the idea that cities don't demand everything.  After all, what city doesn't demand food?  Goods?  It's just a game, but games such as this still generally should try to follow basic expectations that are rooted in reality.  I hope we see some mods to address this as well.

Overall, the biggest improvements over TF1 I can think of are;
- Better maps and variety:  I love that we now have open bodies of water and more value added to the shipping aspect of the game.
- Modular stations are really very nice.  I will still very much miss the ability to curve the stations as we had (via mods) in TF1.  I hope similar efforts eventually pop up in the workshop, but in the meantime, I was always annoyed in TF1 and Train Fever how much of a chore it often was to upgrade a station.

I would still highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys the genre, just be prepared to not be blown away by any one thing.

The improvements (like the map editor and modular stations) are strong and the core gameplay is still great (mainly because it's the same).

Why, oh why, did they dumb down the economy??  Honestly, the one thing I wanted from this game was a deeper economic system with more complex industry.  Instead we got the exact opposite.  Now, towns only accept 2 resources and certain resources have been simplified.  I don't get it.  I understand they wanted to make the game more accessible to new players (which it is), but if you can't do that while also accommodating the base who will make up the vast majority of your sales, what's the point??

Having said that, I cant recommend this game to anyone that liked TF1. While they improved a lot of things, like the UI, they cut or changed a lot of things for the worse. TF2 feels in some regards more like a predecessor not a successor of TF1. To give you a short overview:

+ trains etc. look really nice
+ map look more natural than vanilla TF1
+ performance is good (because cities are much smaller)
+ modular stations are great
+ some balance changes to industrie (e.g. there are no more cows)

o asian vehicle set is nice but more or less russian and not asian and easily replaced by TF1 mods
o tropical climate set is a good addition
o island maps are great, but map generation fails here sometimes and they are only available for tropical climate
o UI changes; some are great some aren't in the end it balances itself out
o income system hasent changed
o industries do no longer need demand from a city to start producing
o emission system 

- cities are a lot smaler and city size is limited by the initial city size (e.g. in 1960 I usually had 3000 people per city in TF1, the limit for cities in TF seems to be around 1000-2000 depending on the initial size)
- cities only demand two products and they are fixed (there was a lot of room here for improvement e.g. number of product depending on city size,...)
- hard mode is way to easy compared to TF1
- easy/normal mode seems to hard for new players
- some vehicles are still useless and some are straight downgrades
- no chain signals
- cant replace/add vehicles on a train, you have to rebuy/upgrade the whole thing (which can be done anywhere)

15,Transport Fever 2,59877039,english,"Welcome to Transport Fever 1.5, where the graphics are a bit prettier than V1 (good), the stations are more modular (good), the freight system is screwier in that some cities don't need food or fuel to be provided by the only significant transport network on the map and get it instead from... I don't know, a magic carpet or something (WT????)... and where not one iota of effort has been put into the single most infuriating part of the gameplay, track and road laying (bad. Very, very bad).

Oh, you'll still ""enjoy"" those classic Transport Fever 1 track building error messages; ""too much slope"", ""too much curvature"", ""too much chilli sauce on your french fries"", ""construction not possible because {shrug}, don't wanna""... but all those other fan faves are there too:
- ""Zoom in to build so that you can't even vaguely see where the other end of your line is so spend a few hundred grand drawing in a line which you hope might, possibly, connect to the far end"". 
- ""Ctrl+Z is for sissies, If you didn't MEAN to put the track 5 degrees off from where you need to link up to the other end, why, you should never have done it!"" 
- ""Track planning? Who needs it?!"" Just commit to laying down the track and hope that the slightly differently shaded terrain map doesn't indicate that a 5 mile long tunnel will be needed."" 

Oh, and my personal favourite, the lack of any auto snap so that when you drag your track up to the existing track, the end of your new line is about 5 feet away. And strangely metal lines don't stretch, can you imagine that?

Did I say that that was my favourite? Sorry, my bad. ""Line 1 has a problem, but it's a secret and I won't tell you what it is"" is my absolute fav; it's such fun. In a loop it was showing one station as a terminus. It isn't. The track forms a continuous loop. I tediously followed the track aaaaallll the way from that station to the one before it. Nothing. Wrong. NOTHING. No gaps, no issues... save for the fact that ""Line 1 has a problem"" and that there was ""no route available"".

Maybe, possibly, it's because I had to put the station on a weird angle adjacent to the road because stations have the catchment area of a teaspoon, and there is some unknown and unknowable ""obstruction"", but trying to find it is someone else's idea of fun, not mine. 

I suppose that I could obliterate the track along with my bank balance and try again, but this comes back to the failure of the devs to address IMHO the biggest issue with TF1, the failure to be able to plan a line before you commit money to it and/or the ability to walk it back while you're paused without blowing fistfuls of cash.

I like the general concept of TPF, I like the whole planning of a network, but when a network fails to work because ""nah, not gunna"" and when there is so much tedium involved in just trying to get something to include a decent sized catchment, it ceases to be fun. 

If I'm not finding any enjoyment in the game, and at this point I'm not, I can't in good conscience recommend it.

Detailed system to create massive multi-vehicle networks
Great improvement over last game with multi stage stations and platforms for goods
Map editor implemented into core game
More of vehicle choice, map offsets and terrain options
Towns now have specified need system, that is easy to see and interact
Added pollution for realism

Cos:
Town now are more specified in goods needs, thus losing complexity of the first game
To the extent it's just improved and more optimised first game
At current stage stations for some reason reset in goods/people count after changes to them are made, making lines reset and thus lose profit for a shot time, and it drives me nuts!!!

Logistics game with Road vehicles, trains, ships, and airplanes...
Seems like a solid product on release(I have experienced 0 critical bugs)
This from a developer known to stay with their product, I am excited to see what expansions/fixes they have planned for 2020.

The only personal grievances I have, is with the UI lacking some short-cuts (clicking on a vehicle lists does not bring up the vehicle data - but instead focuses the camera on said vehicle), and list lacking expected information. (E.g the list of vehicles in a route does not display the age of the vehicles.)

Example you can upgrade buildings and even combine passenger and cargo stations together. This is nice so you can build better looking stations. It work in such a way you can install modules to the sides of a station a bit building with lego.
You can also expand your stations quite easy.

The campaign act as a little bit of a tutorial. In general the missions are good all though the first 2-3 missions feel rather simple.
I have not had any problems with stability or speed of the game but i also dident play long enough to get a big transport  empire.

- The little negative i do feel like the new UI is a little more difficult to use than the old one, example to attach a wagon to an excisting train you need to click a wrench to edit a train, while in TS1 you could just drag and drop a new wagon.
- The route system is more or less the same, but it look different to be honest i liked the old one better.
That was a bit more intuiative.
- The music is annoying ( turn it off, no big deal )

52,Transport Fever 2,59661060,english,"As a player of Transport Fever 1 and a general fan of Transport Tycoon style games, I have to say I'm disappointed in this sequel. The improvements offered are mainly presentational in nature, like graphics, maps or campaign. Things I do not much care for. While none of the core gameplay improvements I hoped for materialised.

Edit: Updating my review to include some info shared by IraRock. Apparently factories no longer consider supply and demand when accepting raw materials. Allowing the player to transport raw materials to a factory that never exports anything for a profit in perpetuity. This is extremely broken and not how it worked in Transport Fever 1. In TF1 you had to manage the whole supply chain and you could only transport raw materials based on how many finished products were being sold. I personally didn't mind the other changes to industry that much, but this is wildly off mark and broken.

Trains were the main focus in Transport Fever 1 and continue to be the main focus in Transport Fever 2. This is not a bad thing necessarily, but other forms of transportation feel even more neglected in this sequel. I focused on shipping on my first game and found that the game mechanics don't really favor ships. Passenger ships generally don't work at all or are condemned to run at an heavy loss. Cargo ships work better, but are highly conditional as there is no garantee there is a viable route accessable by water and it seems like for the same volume they cost significantly more than trucks or trains. I didn't try airplanes yet, but road vehicles work pretty much the same as before.

Then I tried using trains and found that train track maintenance has been increased massively. The double track passenger line that I set up, like I usually do to start off, ended up running at a 100k monthly loss just because the tracks maintenance feels like it's several times what it used to be.

Overall the tracklaying has not been improved. You still place down a blueprint when building tracks that you can then accept or reject, similar how it works in other games like Railroad Empire. However unlike Railroad Empire, in Transport Fever you can only lay down a blueprint for a single segment and you can't use waypoints and can only modify the beginning and the end point and the elevation at the endpoint. This is the same for TF1 and TF2. Using this system building long and complex tracks is very tedious and requires constant saving and loading unless you want to lose large amounts of money deleting and rebuilding tracks. This becomes even more tedious when bridges, tunnels or intersections are involved as the tracklaying becomes even more fiddly and costly. This is one of the issues I was hoping would be improved on the most, but from gameplay videos I was already suspecting it wouldn't be.

In addition it seems like lines can still only use a single terminal/station line, even Railroad Empire has managed to implement something as basic as vehicles choosing to use an empty terminal instead of insisting on using a specific terminal.

The map size feels a little better and doesn't feel quite as cramped as TF1 was, but building train junctions is still problematic. Road building doesn't seem to be greatly improved, it's still very basic.

I'm not a big fan of the new UI. There's more clicking and more menus or tabs to go through. Line management and info is now divided into three menus. It's generally harder to find information. And the general design is even more boring, imitating the all too common boring minimalist flat design used everywhere nowadays.

Overall I'd say that if you have Transport Fever 1 then you're not going to lose much by giving this one a miss. If you're new to Transport Fever or transport management games it comes down to what you're looking for. TF does offer some complexity other might not have, even if it might not do it very well, and good graphics, but there are transport management games that are more accessible and that are more specialised.",1576071812,1576355418,FALSE,365,16,0.801050425,45,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,312,6,218,0,165,1576111085

65,Transport Fever 2,59849664,english,"After a short time of playing, this is my initial impressions about Transport Fever 2 compared to Transport Fever 1.

[h1] Economy [/h1]
[b] The Good [/b]
I really like the improvements to clarity on how demand and supply works. In the first game, this was confusing at times to understand why there were seemingly random fluctuations in demand. Being able to clearly see a building's Production, shipment, and transport is a real improvement.  Also a huge improvement is the seemingly instant recognition of a new transport line. In the first game, it was always a rough start at the beginning of a map having to wait for buildings to start production and for passengers to accumulate. 

I also like how towns now show their progress and what you can do to improve the size of the town. The clarity is extremely helpful and can help shape a town how you want. 

[b] The Bad [/b]
While I like the improvements to understanding the economy, I feel it was been greatly dumbed down. Towns now only accept 2 types of cargo? This seems way too simplified. I liked how in 1 there was a demand for every product so I could have the freedom to choose where to start. Not only that, it makes little sense that every building in the town has only 1 need. This means I have no reason to create cargo hubs like I did in the first game, as every town needs something different. 

I had also wished for more complex industry in Transport Fever 2 over the first game, instead I got the opposite. The only good thing is that oil now makes more sense, having to ship it to a Oil refinery and then to a Fuel refinery is a welcome improvement... However, nothing new was added and some complexity, such as buildings having multiple choices for input, was removed. Farms, for example, now only produce grain. Bakeries only accept grain. It was nice having both livestock and grain options. Same for Stone and tools, being able to select multiple was nice.  I was also hoping for some new industries to make things more interesting. 

[h1] Management [/h1]
I only have good things to say about the management improvements. I am going to just quickly list everything that i like. 
* Finance Table and Chart
* New Vehicle Manager that lets you clone and upgrade vehicles
* Changes to how Condition and Maintenance works
* Line Statistics

[h1] Building [/h1]
Building and running lines, more or less is the same, which is fine since Transport Fever 1 mechanics worked great. However, the addition of modular stations is by far a welcome addition to the game. No more fiddling around in smaller towns having both a passenger and a cargo station separate. The only criticism I have here is the lack of curved stations, at least from what I can tell so far. 

[h1] Graphics [/h1]
Not a whole lot here has changed, but the game looks pretty good already. The UI facelift is a good improvement. Overall, the graphics are in a pretty good place.

[h1] Other Thoughts [/h1]
I REALLY like the free map creator. Its is great that I can preview a map before jumping into it. I really like games that give you choices like the new map creator does. This is a great improvement over the first game, particularly the Desert and Tropical maps. 

The introduction of Asian trains is a nice addition. I always wondered why they were not there in the first game, despite them have a great variety as well. 

The changes to how time works is, imo, a fantastic change. I can 'pause' time but still keep running. It looks like income is now real-time based instead of based around the in game time. This makes it particularly useful if I want to make a map that is purely stuck in the 1900s for a long time or I want to slowly transition between eras at my own pace. Alternatively, this change gives me the ability to speed through eras if I choose. A very welcome change over having to 'mod' the game to slow time down.

The developers made some very questionable design decisions with TF2.

Biggest disappointment in TF2 is how easy the game is now. Hard mode is a joke.

If you want a challenge in hard difficulty free mode, stick to Transport Fever1.

5 years in and the some of the main culprits still haven't been properly taken care of. Factories still can't balance the production output evenly between two chains, resulting in production losses in one chain and almost complete lack of production in the other. The engine feels the same and it would seem that the devs still haven't learned much from the community, leaving much of the work to the modders instead (no overpasses, curved stations etc). Why on earth is the auto-replacement gone? It used to be possible to just click on the line in order to replace all vehicles, now it can only be found in vehicle management window. To make things worse, required line needs to be selected before the vehicles are chosen individually. Makes sense if only the oldest vehicles need replacing, but there is no info about the age of them there! It's on another window and it's just a descriptive information instead of the actual age. Why the change?
Fair do's, the graphics has been greatly improved, the free play map preview is a plus, campaign mode looks interesting at first glance, some of the production issues have been addressed and modular stations are a huge change for better.

4,Transport Fever 2,59736476,english,"Over all I would recommend the game. Though it does have a lot of downsides as well as a lot of changes from the previous game that I have yet to determine whether I find them to be better or worse. But on the whole the game mostly improves from the previous game. Following are noncomprehensive lists of some of the more notable pros and cons that come to mind.

The positives:
-It is visually much better in my opinion. Better lighting. So much more and varied flora in the environments and the addition of fauna as well. Not only are the graphics better but the camera options let you view the game in ways you couldn't in the previous game. Such as the ride along camera which you can now fully control rather than being stuck looking forward at all times.

-Map creation is much improved. Not only is there a map editor in the game now but when just randomly creating a new game you have a lot more options you can choose to customise it, and you are given a preview of the map before wasting time generating a map you don't like. Each environment type, Europe, America, and the new Tropical, each have a different set of map generation parameters this time so that you can choose from much more varied random generations. In the previous game the map generation was identical between environment types. The only thing it changed was the ground textures and the tree/bush varieties.

-Modular stations. Although the implementation of this feature seems a bit rough around the edges it still adds a lot of customisation to the functionality of stations, as well as to simply the look and size of stations. Perhaps the biggest functional improvement this feature adds is allowing truck and bus/tram stations the ability to have multiple entry and exit points, and this allows for far more vehicles using the stations before causing traffic congestion.

-Connection paths that connect buildings/stations to each other and to roads. Previously you always needed to connect a station to another station or a station to an industry by having a piece of road connecting them. Now you can simply place them close together and little direct paths will be created between them, connecting them. This now allows you to connect a train station for instance directly to an industry from any side of the industry with no roads involved.

-The addition of cargo planes. Which I'm not a big fan of when it comes to transporting raw resources simply because it seems silly to me. But for transporting finished goods it is an interesting new addition to the game. 

-New vehicles. Having a larger variety of vehicles is always nice. Granted you could always get new vehicles from the modding community, but having officially added, high quality and (supposedly) properly balanced new vehicles are always nice to see.

-Traffic lights and one way roads. The addition of traffic lights will finally allow us to avoid particularly congested intersections from getting grid locked as would occur in the previous game. One way roads allow for a lot more customisation of the road network in general such as the ability to make proper highways for instance.

Changes:
-Town growth now works on a modifier mechanic which allows the player to clearly see just what and how to improve the size of a town. With the new system supplying cargo now can have a much more meaningful impact on town growth compared to the previous game. And there are negative modifiers that come from having congested road traffic,  from emissions and from overcrowded stops/stations. So it is now about maximising the positive modifiers and minimising the negative modifiers to achieve maximum town growth. Though this new mechanic comes with a fairly significant downside which I mention further down.

-Cargo chains and supply ratios have been altered. For the most part all raw resources are consumed on a 2 to 1 ratio now, with the exception of stone quarries. This definitely changes the way you might setup your networks as it becomes much more difficult to setup lines where your vehicle is full in both directions in order to maximise profit. Machine and Tool factories are now separate factories and have been given just a single recipe each. The Fuel chain is now a 3 step process instead of just 2 steps. Towns now only accept 2 randomly chosen (during map generation) finished products rather than all towns requiring all finished products.

-Cargo supply mechanics have been changed. Now you can, starting from the raw resource industries, supply cargo to industries in the next step of the chain without the need for completing the chain all the way to the towns. But only upto the minimum consumption level of the next industry in the chain. To upgrade the consumption level of the industries still requires actually finding and supplying for the demand of the products the intermediate industries make. On the one hand this is a simplification of the mechanics of the previous game making it easier. However on the other hand, because of the other changes to supply and consumption ratios along with the reduced options when it comes to supplying finished goods to towns, the new simplification to production seems to help balance out the added difficulties.

Negatives:
-The changes to the UI seem to be, for the most part, bad. In part it may be due to simply being used to the previous game. However there are definitely downsides such as having to click on more things on a regular basis to get the info you may want or to do certain functions. Opening certain windows causing certain other windows to automatically close that you didn't want closed and things like that. The minor improvements made seem to just be outweighed by the negatives in my opinion.

-Town growth and size. Though towns can visually grow vertically more easily than before, the actual footprint of the towns seems smaller and the size the towns can grow to has been greatly restricted. Because of the new modifier system that determines town growth, towns are now always growing relative to their original size since the modifiers are based on the original size of the town. If a town starts with a population of 50 than acquiring a 200% total positive modifier means the town will increase up to 150pop. Where as a town that starts with a population of 200 that acquires a 200% total positive modifier will increase up to 600pop. In the previous game all towns could potentially reach any size and the cap on size was far greater and more open ended.

-Ground works. When building you will often either cut into the ground or build elevated embankments of ground. This now automatically reverts to it's original state when a construction is removed. This leads to considerable expense and annoyance for me. The cost associated with these cuts and embankments is considerable and now if you want to demolish a section of road and relay it a bit differently you have to repay for the entirety of the ground works involved rather than just the difference from the changes made.

There is a considerable amount more I could say but I have run out of space. Suffice to say that I think the game overall is an improvement and adds a number of core changes to the game to spice things up a bit from the previous game.",1576191388,1576316735,TRUE,9,0,0.611871302,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,681,4,18025,4,699,1601420322

- Really weird politics in the scenarios that highlight a lack of diversity in the dev team.
- Economy aspects of TF1 toned down and are less interesting.

The fluidity of the framerates is smooth if you have a good high end PC and GPU.  The new map editor is fantastic but glitchy.  Having to import my old mods into a community created converter to get it to work in the new game is a little of an annoyance but they did  that because they changed over to FBX support for mods. The model editor included with the games files is supposed to let novice modders create their own mods if they know how to make 3D Models in applications like Blender.  However the new model editor is having some issues and does not work correctly yet.  

So many improvements, and so much more to discover yet.

Now I just gotta get my mods converted over so I can focus on my new stuff.

For those that asked, no there is no night mode officially but someone has created a mod that gives you that mode, its not a cycle mod tho so its permanently night time all the time its used.

There is some issues with the UI where some windows are permanently affixed to the bottom of the screen (please fix that).  The ability to not edit a train consist once you take the train back to a depot, is annoying as you have to sell your train and create a new one any time you want to make consist changes (please fix that).

The new station editor is genius. You plop modules down around the station to make it larger and to customize it. This time around you can deliver and PICKUP freight at the same station as passengers.

Bus and Truck stations are also customizable, as are airports and ferry terminals.

I can keep going but I have only had a few hours to play it. I am sure my fans want more USA trains so I gotta get back to that stuff.

45,Transport Fever 2,59793530,english,"TL:DR

The second iteration of the popular TF1 unfortunately has next to no gameplay enhancements, and objectives, dynamism, and real-world simulations are entirely absent. The failure to better model real-world economics and transport systems turns what would be a brilliant production into a very average one. One places down routes and purchases vehicles and watches these move all over the map, but the failure to create dynamic structures for how these routes then play out completely ruins the game. 

I spent 500+ hours in TF1 to enjoy the modelling of my own beautiful train set. TF2 was supposed to be about creating a real-world transport empire, as close to scale as modern technology and hardware allows. Unfortunately this has failed utterly.

Cons
- Re-skin of TF1. Particularly, the vehicles have all simply been copied and pasted over with no changes (even graphically) to these vehicles. 
- Removal of auto-replace of vehicles, making it an absolute chore to go about replacing vehicles every 15 years. 
- Absolutely no adjustments made to industry/town dynamics, meaning towns grow exactly as they had in TF1.
- No dynamism in transport routes. For example, if you set a boat/train etc on a goods transport route, it will make exactly the same profit every single year (with a slight decrease for escalating maintenance costs). There must just be something a little more dynamic. Breakdowns, weather (snow-storms, rain, nature disasters), factory problems, contract requests, changing commodity prices. Just something to alleviate the deadening monotony. 
- First-person camera view of the vehicles is all still the same, and again there is no rolling behaviour synonymous with typical vehicle movement, just the sickening lurches every time the vehicle changes direction. 
- Collisions still happen (i.e. boats etc will still ghost through each other, boats will go through bridges). It's a bit amateurish for $35. 

Pros
- It looks nice, and the products (i.e. steel, wood) look particularly gorgeous when they can be seen. 
- Boat transportation routes seem to be working a little better (at least they make more sense). The increase in water space devoted to the map also means running detailed boating networks is also a little more possible now. 
- The map is larger, which means that towns are not squashed against each other, and there is a better feeling of space. 
- As a digital version of building one's own railroad and train set, this is still the go-to product to alleviate that itch. It is wonderful to watch trains rolling lazily through the countryside, and to watch passengers move around.",1576276061,1576276061,FALSE,0,0,0.496802181,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,96,7,2080,0,533,1592687372

I've been playing on the slowest date progression to experience the most out of every era in free play mode and never really find myself wanting for more. Though the end is always in sight, as you can see all production facilities and town needs as soon as you load your first map. That doesn't mean things are easy though, you will have to plan carefully to make sure you can actually pull a profit. I've been playing on medium difficulty, and the game is difficult to manage at first (there was much restructuring as I found lines were losing too much money to bother keeping), but once you get the hang of what you're supposed to be doing, it should be pretty smooth sailing. It's a lot of fun managing how much cash you have to deal with new routes and expand. The game allows the player to influence every aspect of the maps growth. You provide the raw materials in various chain lengths (some goods require a simple 1-1 line, others will require multiple goods shipped for one product, and others will be the child of those multiple line products), and eventually ship them into the towns of your choice, where cities begin to thrive. This will then allow the player to send passengers to various locales. The player has many ways of hurting town growth as well. If the player is too ambitious with their lines, traffic and pollution will drive people away. I've barely touched the campaign mode, but from what I have seen, it features fun quests following the eras that give a little bit more purpose to your transport empire. It is a welcome distraction from optimizing your lines and a great way to introduce the player to the game.

64,Transport Fever 2,59704060,english,"After 10+ hours of play on release day, there [i]are[/i] a few critical problems.

The UI is a disaster. Not altogether surprising, since it's been their weakness ever since Train Fever.
The number of different windows to achieve just one action is daft... and exhausting. (setting up a new line; reviewing the progress of a line and making small changes like adding or removing a vehicle)

The interface scaling feature is nice... but makes everything either too small or too big on my rig; seems mad that I might have to buy a new screen to play this game.

The interface colours are the worst of it. So here's one of the best improvements in the game, and how to ruin it:

When creating a consist ([i] le terme technique en Anglais pour la composition du train[/i]) you can now choose loco and wagons BEFORE YOU BUY. You can even see the capacity of the resulting train. You can also see how much it's going to cost. [b]In red, on a pale blue background.[/b] Yes you read that right. Even if you're not colorblind, it's painfully difficult to read. In general, the color choices in the interface are [i]just terrible.[/i] So bad they impact game play.

Worst of all, is the ""Winter Wonderland Overlay."" When in line management or construction mode, a bright white overlay is added to the whole screen which is both straining to the eyes (with the constant switches in luminance) and also results in inadequate contrast in map features and structures so that, for example, while laying rails, it's [i]harder[/i] to see potential cuts and fills when it should be easier. This seems downright mad... so Given how good Urban Games have been in the past at fixing and improving, I wouldn't be at all surprised if many of the UI problems are fixed in the not too distant future.

I'd also like to bewail the absence of the Company Logo feature. I want to use my gorgeously designed Radiant Railways logo again, dammit!

Finally, the lack of auto-replace (it's been replaced with a ""maintenance"" feature that isn't a waste of space; it allows a degree of realism, and means you can keep very old rolling stock if you happen to like it, which many transport enthusiasts do) means that vehicle management is even more micro that it was before. Which is okay for trains. But for trams, busses and trucks, kinda tedious.

The stations are mostly awesome, with one exception. Truck stations are still hopeless. Even though they're all modular now (which is great), no matter what you do with terminal placement and entrance and exit configurations, trucks still loop around in a sort of mad dance, and different truck routes cross over and foul each other [b]inside the station[/b]. I created a series of mods for TF1 to solve this. Hoping that I won't have to do it again because I don't like the idea of learning to mod the much more complex modular system. The problem is the same for the tram stations (which are basically the same asset). Fortunately, you can solve the problem by just [b]building several of them side-by-side[/b].

Okay, [b]NOW THE GOOD STUFF[/b]:

1. Industry goods flow predictably, without unexpected and coslty drop-offs in production or inexplicable (or merely incalculable) reasons for routes being too long. The system [i]actually works[/i]. This is a really big improvement. It makes playing with the industry goods feel like goods management rather than an obscure Japanese puzzle game. There's still a glitch with ""goods buffering"" (looping more than once on the same route with different terminals) that results in a ""coals to newcastle"" effect; but more testing will show if buffering is even necessary.

1.1 Industry networks are better too, since you have to link more than one primary resource to a secondary or tertiary factory. It makes for a more realistic network, although the placement of industry is still random, so still not terribly realistic. Hoping there will be a ""raw resources only"" and ""industry building"" mod combo that will solve the placement issues in the near future (as there already are in TF1).

2. Shipping is economically viable. I haven't had enough time to test whether it's actually competitive with rail for goods transport, but at least it's economically viable and routes that use shipping only don't suddenly stop producing as they did in TF1.

3. YOU CAN MAKE REAL HARBORS, AND EVEN [b]""CANALS""[/b]
Changes to terrain modification mean you can now change shoreline... creating inlets and building realistic-looking ports, along with the modular ports. This is just fantastic. It's also possible to create shipping canals to cut longer journeys short... but very expensive, of course. I'm disappointed that there isn't a full canal system with locks, tunnels, aqueducts, etc. Maybe we can wish for that in an update (or a mod...?).

4. The modular Rail Stations and Ports are a joy. I can't praise them enough. A huge leap forward.

[u][b]In summary:[/b][/u]

Some very big improvements to gameplay. Some UI teething troubles that are a step in the wrong direction but I can't imagine won't be fixed rapidly.

68,Transport Fever 2,59779717,english,"I'm impressed. I’ve experienced some graphical glitches and occasional frame drops, but the modular stations make for an interesting puzzle, I like the strategy added by giving cities two specializations, industry spawn location is improved, and the economics seem better balanced.

If I'm building a cargo station, I may as well build a passenger line, and once I've done that, how do I make the lines share a double track? Then later, a quad-track. Giving each city two specializations provides a lot more focus, too. Instead of finding the shortest route between factories, you must also consider the demand of nearby cities. If you can sell a route to one city, that's OK. If you can sell it to three, you're in the money! The algorithms for factory placement must have been revised, as well. It's relatively easy to find and start a single resource goods route. It gives you more options in 1850 and provides a more logical progression from single to multi-resource routes. I always hated that starting a goods route in 1850 on TpF1 put you on the struggle bus 9/10 times. It seems easier to turn a profit in TF2, but the revised maintenance expenses are a good balance. I have yet to feel like my cash liquidity is running away from me, even after setting up some solid goods lines. Creating a single depot and laying a passing track instead of double track are a lot more important now.

The game is a little rough around the edges on launch week. If that’s going to bother you, check back in a month. Otherwise, it’s a solid improvement over TpF1 with more strategy options.

5,Transport Fever 2,59759734,english,"Pros and Cons

+ I think the passenger side of the economy seems to be running sweet if you're into that over freight.
- The Industry supply and demand needs some big changes 

Minor bugs:
- When you copy a vehicle it should spawn from the nearest depot instead of the last one you purchased from (this glitch destroys the usefulness of the cool new features for coping vehicles)
- Auto vehicle replacement like TF1 (replacing old vehicles didn't reduce operating expenses)

Re-invented broken wheel:
- 2 x industry demands per city just doesn't work.. it's really boring.. they literately spawn right next to the industry they need too
- Max Industry output of 400 is only good for 2 young cities :(even on hard setting they're conveniently spawned really close):  
- MORE INDUSTRIES!!!!! Surely the TF1 mods and many comments asking for it would get that up there on the build list RW Tycoon was awesome for it... Loved that game 

The whole micro sized industry with little tiny rail networks and little tiny workshops the biggest let down for my preferred play style.. for now. Someone has already attempted to fix the spawning issue using a mod but the lack of scaling up production and sending goods far and wide is still just a dream 

Hope they open up the full demands asap 


Pros over TF1 
- no waiting for new lines to say yes for connection  (If everything is connected, everything runs straight away)
- managing lines and vehicles is so much better. 
- all the other stuff in the trailers you also thought was cool
- It does feel like a really good starting point for the game.. Probably a little behind schedule when they released it. If the modding community is half the size of TF1 it will still get there with our without devs 

IDK why so many people are saying it crashes heaps.. this UP TO DATE COMPUTER hasn't missed a beat 

Saying it's a bad copy of TF1 is a going a bit far... These people are probably into COD though haha.

Whilst the new game is a major improvement in terms of graphics, I am not sure the UI has improved and if anything it is more complicated to navigate. Also, a number of features from the first game have been removed which (to me) makes the UI seem more clumsy. An example is setting up a new line. In TF1 you could do this from the same screen as the buying vehicles screen. In the new game they are two separate processes. Merging trains / carriages is another omission from the first game. Also, it does need a bit of optimisation to get it running more smoothly with a number of people having issues in terms of frame rates.

it takes a few hours to get used to the new user interface, in fact I think the TF1 UI was a bit more polished, but this game is just released so I'm sure we'll be seeing patches or mods for this in the future.

Functionality is great, hardly any bugs, and none of them game braking:
- maintenance feature needs polishing, it's currently worth ignoring.
- occasional bug where road vehicles wait too early for a railway crossing, causing traffic jams.
- silver ore does not show in the railway trucks (campaign mode)
- HUD filter icons for cost and income are reversed

my favourite new features:
- Terrain texturing! I'ts great to make the place look pretty (for free) whilst waiting for cash to roll in.
- Ride along cam in improved. you can now ride first person and adjust the camera with mouse.
- Grass, wildlife, improved water effects make the place look stunning.

23,Transport Fever 2,59749627,english,"I think its a little weird how negative some people are being about this title.

If you're new to the series, this is a fine one to buy.  It's a great game.  Most of the fanboi meltdown is because it's just not a massive leap forward from the previous game.   So they aren't recommending it even though they like it just fine and are just a little bent that it didn't make all their digital train set dreams come true.

And I agree, its not a huge leap forward, I do think the devs really dropped the ball on an opportunity to move it forward a few steps.  But it is every bit as good as the previous and looks better, and is a little more refined (but still kinda clunky).

Maybe the discount for owners of the previous one should have been a little deeper, maybe that would have chilled them a little.

Anyhow, all that said... It's good, its got some balance issues that I hope the devs will address going forward, its a little too hard in some ways in the very early game and quickly becomes too easy.  Once you understand the differences in the rhythms between this one and the previous, you break through it really fast.

The music in the first one was far superior.

Anyhow, if you're a previous owner, you're getting the previous version with some nicer graphics and a few new tricks.  And if you've never played before, buy this one, the previous one will feel pretty old right out of the box.  Even this one isn't exactly this weeks technology.   But if you like this type of game, you'll enjoy it.  It's more of a sandbox than a game you try to win anyhow, so most of that balance stuff doesn't matter anyhow... It's a digital train set, and nobody wants to fight with their train set, they just want to build it and watch it... And thats easy to do in this.

I don't see new industries, we still can produce and refine same shit. How about paper? How about gold, jewels? Post? Don't see it. Production industries now cannot be extended. Only refinery industries get updates.
No improvements in transport: one line may only utilize one platform. Train tracks also haven't got any attention, those still have the same problems from the first game.
New features buggy too. You have to juggle with one way entrances and exits before your lines stop looping in the station.
They also killed nice transport autoupdate mechanics. Now you need to track every single one transport unit in order to update it (because bulky update will lead to unnecessary updates of newer vehicles).
Adding to new bugs, there are some issues with sounds overcome music, also game is unstable and sometimes may crash.

Edit: I've changed the resolution down to 1080p and switched off vsync in settings.lua. This results in a somewhat stable 50 FPS with 2xAA. I'll keep playing around with this (and different scenarios in the game) and report back here.

Looked forward to this title after I watched Squirrel play it for a bit. Unfortunately tho, this suffers from the same issue as Transport Fever 1 (and Train Fever for that matter): bad performance.

My specs:
Intel i5-8600K
NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 Ti (probably the culprit here)
16 GB of DDR4 @ 2,666GHz
1440p monitor

With the default setting of everything on high I get 20 FPS. With everything turned to the lowest I get a somewhat steady 30 FPS. The highest I've seen it go is 48 FPS but that was at the edge of the map without much of the map in view. I'll see if changing the resolution does anything. But from what I read on the forums it's the same for people with a RTX 2060.

Other than the performance this is a great title. I already had a bunch of fun in the few minutes I played. But I will probably refund this one until I get a better GPU. I suggest you only get this if you either have a better setup or don't mind underwhelming performance.",1576061860,1576191995,TRUE,0,0,0.437920988,6,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,78,15,8967,0,38,1599248230

This isn't a reskin, despite what other comments are saying. 

Terrain and coast modification is better. (As in, you can actually modify coast). There's a map editor. More varieties of map. Extra props etc. There's also a terrain painter by default.

There's been some UI improvements, and the station customisation is far better. (No bendy stations yet though, which is a shame. But that was a mod.)

There's a greater variety of vehicles, far greater, by default. 

The graphics in general are radically improved, although I can see the arguments for reskin here as some of the improvements are rather subtle. 

The Music and sound is also better/less repetitive. 

City growth is far simpler, and easier to understand and manipulate. 

There's no more annoying triangles, and glitches. Things are working a lot smoother snapping wise, which is hard to notice without going back and playing TF1 and realising how prevalent that was. 

The big, negative change, is cargo distribution. Cities now only accept 2 goods, as opposed to all 6 like TF1. This means that if there are no industries that supply a town near it, you end up making massive huge truck chains in order to even break even, as Trains are very expensive and can no longer supply multiple towns. 

This also means that once you're done with those, you're done. No towns want more items. So you can hit the point where it's not worth making any more things, due to distance, and you're making money hand over fist so can't be bothered.

There has been some balancing, between consumption and production, but overall that is the one resounding negative change. The UI being nonsensical is sort of the same as the last game. 

Overall, so far, I would recommend this. But bare in mind it does *feel* like TF2, even if under the hood there's a lot of subtle improvements. 

For those who haven't played TF1:

This is OTTD but for the modern age. It has a slight difference of forcing things along lines, but that's kind of it. Cities need supplies and passengers, you send those supplies and passengers. You build the rails, more roads, the trams, the trucks, you create intricate transport networks, and by the time you finally fully connect a city it's 2am and you have work in the morning. 

However, if you're debating it, buy Transport fever 1. It's cheaper, and you'll see if you like this kind of game.",1576177283,1576190455,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,722,26,2884,12,385,1600879687

Running anything is phenomenally expensive, but trains are a joke. I was doing fine - although progress was painfully slow - until I added a train and next thing I know, I'm making a huge loss. Ended up selling my ships running passengers between islands and eventually sold the trains too. Later tried adding trains again, but hit big problems trying to shift freight as the wagons want to only load and unload logs, even though I filtered to just picking up and delivering bricks. Seems this is the default cargo for those wagons and you cannot change them until you have built the train, assigned it to the line and sent it on it's way, but even though the Line setting shows it is set to pick up only bricks and one station and unload them at another, the train is saying it's cargo is logs, so piles into the station full of bricks and goes out again empty.

The maintenance feature on vehicles is just plain annoying. Changing them so they stay in good condition will send you straight into the red. Ignoring them results in endless pop-ups telling you they are in poor condition and your towns won't grow.

Pros:
-I like this more than the first Transport Fever
-It's very pretty

Cons:
-No AI to compete with in freeplay mode
-Difficult building placement (Who uses shift+M/N?)
-Can place loading areas next to producers and it will not fill

This is the primary complaint I got against my review of Transport Fever 1 and I'm sure it will be the same here. I didn't play the tutorial. I absolutely hate tutorials and think that games are poorly designed if you have to play the tutorial in order to play them. For example, I've never played the tutorial for Cities:Skylines yet that game is much more user friendly than this game.

The Review:

I was really excited for this game because I've always wanted a game where you can set up your own transport company. Whether it be cargo or people. I didn't enjoy Transport Fever 1 and sadly I didn't enjoy Transport Fever 2 either. My main problems with Transport Fever 2 are the building placements. I was pressing Q, E, left Ctrl, right Ctrl to try turn the building yet nothing was rotating it. I finally gave up and guess maybe I need to click then rotate the building to orient it to the road. Nope. Google the answer and find out its M + N, however the turns are rather large, maybe 15 degrees, find out later that Shift + M/N turn it in smaller frequencies. That's such an odd button combo. When I was playing the game and guessing what buttons turn buildings Q/E didn't seem like a valuable use, infact I played just 12 hours ago and I don't even remember what Q/E did. I'm blown away by the fact that you can't hold down the mouse button, then circle your mouse to orient a building to a road. 

Onto the next problem I was having. I would place my truck pickup spots next to the producers however for some reason they wouldn't pick anything up. I could see they were linked via highlight but for some reason whenever my trucks would come, they would just leave without picking anything up. For some reason I didn't have this issue with trains. I could see that certain types of haulers/cargo carts would pick up certain items but I saw trucks could pick up all cargo and yet they would come and go empty. 

It's a shame because I really want to like this type of game. However just like the first Transport Fever there are lots of minor UI issues where you can't execute what you want to do and are often left scratching your head or googling how to do what you want. I know this review is going to get lots of negative feedback because I refuse to play the tutorial but I judge games on playability. If you have to go through a tutorial to play the game then it isn't very playable in my opinion. Often times in video games goals a very concrete, this game's goal is to make a transport company that delivers good and makes lots of money. However if you just start a game I would argue that is a very difficult goal to achieve.

I suggest the bad reviewers tried that before slating the game. 
Onto the game. Well since Train fever i have loved everything Urban games has brought us in the series. And am very encouraged to see what this title will bring and hopefully future ones. Graphically its beautiful. The new UI and interface took a while to get around. But after 20mins piece of cake. For any veteran tycoon player like myself you really wont struggle to find your way round it. 
I love that the towns spawn in grids to begin with now. So much easier to plan early on how to lay everything. Town bus networks actually make money now. And the cargo system, even though i have not delved too much into that part yet. Being able to find suppliers to industries is such a good feature. Will save so much time looking for that quarry to supply materials to make bricks, goods etc.  And Finally being able to have passenger/cargo trains share the same stations is huge. While not making the map look like a mess with single lines running from point A - B - C then to its own cargo station. 
I could go on further and i have not even touched on the amazing modding community this game has. TPF1 gave us a good 3 years. And i am sure this one will give us many more years. I clocked 300+ Hours on Both TF and TPF. And this one will get as much if not more of my gaming time. 

I think we should all appreciate what the developers are trying to do here. And they have shown us steam players so much loyalty. And not to sell out for ""other"" platforms. Please don't read the negative reviews and let it be a deal breaker for you. Try the game out if you like it great. If not then review it constructively and not go straight for the developers throat. Try reaching out to them via message boards, email etc. As i have in the past contacted them directly and yep got a response Amazing!

While there are improvments like modular stations, map editor or the new tropical graphics, this game also makes too many steps backwards (even more so when factoring in the great improvements done by modders). Especially when it comes to UI (even the color palettes are ridiculous limited now, with half of em being ugly selections noone will use), the again dumbed down complexity of the economy (2 random goods per city, incomplete chains being profitable, etc.) and the overall lack of challenge/difficulty. Performance should be better, but I am nowhere near a map and modcollection able to test this claim. 

And its a real shame how they ignored so many improvements modder made, for example integrated lkw terminals in industries or waggons/cars fitting the actual years instead of using something from decades behind/later. Even if own development would have been too much, it would have been extremely easy and profitable for all involved to just licence + integrate such work from modders, but somehow that huge potential was ignored?!

I am sure as with TpF1 many of the issues will once again be fixed by the community and some longwinded patching done over the next years, hopefully the whole complexity and difficulty problem as soon as possible before too many get bored. But that waiting for and keeping up with mods/patches in itself was a rather tedious task already in the old game. It certainly will put off plenty of gamers once again.

As for wishes ignored: No prioritizing trains on signals or other way to allow overtaking when several lines use the same roads/rails. No weather, Night/day/season cyles or other noteworthy dynamic visuals to get some atmosphere ( those flock of birds are a laughable tiny step to take), No immersive differences in cargo quantity, pricing and profits within production chains. No Mapfeature which easily gives a full plan of your networks.

TpF1 was at its limits engine wise for what I build, so thats out of the picture.  ... but as it is now it will take quiet some time for TpF2  to become as good as the old one especially regarding gameplay/content.

2,Transport Fever 2,59726734,english,"TLDR: Overall a great game, improving on what TF1 did well. 

Transport Fever 2 takes what was good in TF and improves it a lot more. The new system of town needs actually makes you choose better where you spend your money, in order to fulfill the towns commercial or industrial needs. Also, the graphic improvements are a welcome sight. The new map maker system is also a great addition, since now we can see the map to be created by the seed we input. 

Station construction is amazing, giving you the chance to make realistic machine yards, several platforms for cargo and passengers, and also a central rail for high speed express trains. I loved this the most.

I didn't see the industries I saw on the tutorials (like coffee, for example) so here's wishful thinking for that in the future. Also, raw resources like grain, crude oil or similar do not evolve over time, they just reach the cap and that's it, which means you have to supply a processing industry (like a bakery or an oil refinery) with resources from more than one production field.

5,Transport Fever 2,59726132,english,"As many other fans have, I too waited eagerly for Dec 11th and Transport Fever 2. I loved the first one. The depth and realisim of it all. I love city builders and I love managment games and I really love vehicles. So this game is a top notch match for me. 

And as a sequel, I assumed that it will have all those futures that the first game had, and even more and better. But that's not really the case here. You see, for some reasons the devs decided to take out, or just simply forgot (?), to put it into the game. Eg. the automatic vehicle replacement. How they could possibly forget such a important part of the game does blow my mind. 
Another annoying thing for me is how they re-worked the supply and demand chain. For example, in the first game, if you had a line from a farm to a food processing plant you didn't gain any money for it because the plant couldn't sell the food they were making. So, for to be able to have an income, you also needed to have a line from the plant to a nearby town which in turn needed the food to grow. So in other words, you always needed to take the supply and demand in considiration. If there is no buyer for a product, then the factory don't want the raw product either because they cannot sell the end product. But here, in TF2, that is no longer the case. Here you can simply take the grain to the plant and have a huge income. The plant simply store all that grain.. or maybe throws it out in the garbage? Who knows.. This simply isn't realistic for me and it also makes the game very, very simple and easy. Not that TF 1 was hard. 

Other things, which on the other hand is the other way around, like the traffic lights were missing from the first game now are in this one, which is nice. Specially in later stages in the game when the cities grow bigger. If I will  remember other things I'll write it down.

The story missions are pretty fun, better then in the first game. Altough I have only completed the first chapter.

Visually it's much more pretty, for sure. Even on low setting. The vehicles have high detail with trains haveing moving parts, which I find cool. It's really nice eye candy to have. I do enjoying take a ride with some of my trains and just enjoy the scenery.  

But, in the end, it doens't feel like a sequel to me. It also doesn't feel like a dlc to me, but rather like it's TF 1.5.
It was nice from the devs for giving me 25 % off since I owned the first game, but even tho I think it is really on the edge price wise. Because these thinks that I've described, I don't think it should be 40 euros. More like half. IF they decide that they put in those features and fix the whole supply and demand system than maybe. 

So in summery, I do recemmend this game soley for being a fan of this game series and still love the game for what it is. 
But the fact is, that I'm dissapointed in these things so if there is some new players who wanted to try it out, but doesnt know which one to go for, then I would say go for the first one. Sure, the graphics are a little worser but it has more depth to it with proper functions which makes the game harder.

First of all - the graphics and UI dialogs have gotten a much deserved overhaul. The base game was great before - but very confusing and annoying to work with. The UI dialogs are now in AAA class - instead of feeling rather dated in TF1. Some part of it can be seen as eye candy - but the main change in all the dialogs is the clever way that the user experience has been improved. Now everything that in the ""end game"" felt really tedious is so much easier... Replace that rackety old train is a breeze now... The thing you do a lot like jumping from a line, to a train, to a depot and back to add or replace vehicles etc is now so much smarter. A lot less dialogs popping around making a train purchase or similar a lot easier.

The overlays now look almost as good as Cities Skylines (and that game is almost too good ;)). I also like the added clarity of supply / demand etc that makes it a lot easier to see who demands the goods from one of you raw material sources etc. 

Another great thing is the ""configure"" option for stations etc. Being able to add a passenger platform or another cargo building is great as having two stations (passenger + cargo) in a small town feels awkward. 

The only thing I feel is a bit lacking is the track laying tool that feels almost like TF1. It would be nice to be able to add multiple bending points when laying a track, so that you could add a small bend and tweak that track to see the whole layout before pressing ""buy"". Now you can still end up having to bulldozer that last bit because it was a bit to tight in the end. A good minor fix though is the arrows for the signals that makes it a lot easier to see that you did put that signal on the right side ot the track!

19,Transport Fever 2,59717404,english,"I have not played the first Transport Fever, which made watching previews and reviews of this title annoying because many of them focused on the differences, which I didn't really care for.

The core game loop is fun and interesting. The logistics sim seems quite good, and the modular station building is very useful for growing your logistics network over time. My initial impressions are good over-all, and I anticipate spending quite a lot of time with this title. I expect that the Workshop will be integral to the game's longevity. If you liked Rise of Industry and Railway Empire but felt that they lacked a certain something, like I did, check out Transport Fever 2. It blends a lot of the interesting aspects of those games and adds a lot more to the pot.

I love the sense of technological progress over time, as your various modes of transport become redundant, replaced by newer, better models, and your logistics efficiency improves in kind. I don't recall another game which captured this in quite the same way. Nice work.

There are a number of minor annoyances at launch, such as the lack of ""fullscreen windowed"" display mode, cloud saves weren't working as of this morning, the fastest game speed isn't very fast which results in long periods of waiting for things to happen (in the early campaign at least), and the windows/dialogues seem like they could use a good thorough UX pass.

Some elements of game play are hidden in weird ways. For example, to get into a pure sandbox mode, it's necessary to go into custom settings in a Free Game and enable certain mods. That was not clear from the start. It's more typical to have Sandbox available directly from the main menu.

29,Transport Fever 2,59719601,english,"I played TF 1 for over 1200 hours so it is fairly safe to say that I was a fan. 

TF2 seems to offer some great improvements, especially in the game mechanics. TF 1 if you played on Hard it was a grind, you could make money but you had to be really careful with every line.  Some lines were always losers like internal bus routes and there was a lot of guesswork on where the demand was for.  Boats and Planes were generally unworkable/unbalanced. 

In TF2 so far it looks like it is much more balanced, I'm playing on hard and internal routes are profitable, and boats seem viable.
I was initially concerned that reducing to only 2 products per town would simplify the game but it has actually made it much more complex and challenging.  The lack of easy routes is causing much more thought.
The redesign of the industries has made the workflow much more challenging and interesting too. The cargo chains have been structured to make it harder to get bi-directional train routes which again is an improvement in challenge.  So some major steps forward in game play.

Disappointing misses - there is no change in cargo mechanics, we are rewarded for longer lines, there is no differentiation in cargo. I would have liked to see some cargo being worth more than others or the price reducing the longer the time to delivery.  Similarly I'd like to have seen demand information on passengers to see which were looking for fast routes and which are looking for cheap routes.

I am loving the new changes. The campaigns are actually fun in this game, unlike TF1. The controls seem very intuitive. Graphics are better, and the nice things such as station names on signs at stations is a good thing to see.

I like needing 4 farms to feed into 1 factory to make food that can make a max of 400. I know some don't like that, but I do. I am loving modular stations. I can create an eye sore, or I can spend an hour on 1 station and make it everything I would like to see in a station. I can make a 4 way terminal station if I so choose, or I can make 2 full stop terminals, 2 passthrough. I can see great potential in the mods, and the beautiful buildings that come out of there. Default buildings are good, but some mods will always be better.

I absolutely LOVE freezing time. You still lose money at the end of the ""year"", but you don't skip forward. In TF1, my biggest struggle was the giant leaps of time that kept happening. Just as I think I am OK to unpause the game, I would suddenly get another train, I couldn't afford for the brand new line I just put in the year before. I was always playing catch up with my extra money instead of building new infrastructure. Now, if I want to play in 1920 for 50 years, before I get airplanes, I can do that. I can then choose to no longer pause the date, and move forward. I love the choice being available.

I haven't run into any game breaking bugs yet, and the only one I have seen, I don't know if it was oversight, a bug, or intentional. My right click does not exit build mode, or menus, or anything. Every similar type of game uses this standard control scheme, including TF1, so I cannot fathom why they would force this change, if that is what happened.

Overall, if you like this type of game, give it a go. Next thing you know, you will be way beyond the 2 hour limit for a refund, and saying to yourself, how is it midnight already?",1576164309,1576164309,TRUE,0,0,0.482687563,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,242,43,2559,0,353,1576634608

47,Transport Fever 2,59670924,english,"One word review: Disappointing.

UPDATE: Okay, I've looked to see if I can mod the game. During that time I came across the dev's video (https://youtu.be/Ecxe7TzbhBc?t=291) saying they were aware, in 2016 for TF1, that they were aware people wanted a planning tool. Good grief yes. I'm going to play up to my 2 hour limit then, I think, return the game and do something less frustrating, like vacuuming.

Many word review:
Okay, so I enjoyed the first game and pre-ordered this second but I was really hoping they’d fix the many UI misses of the first game and, well, sadly they don’t seem to have taken this opportunity to do that. I’ll update this review as I play more, though and if I realise I’ve missed anything.

Don’t get me wrong: there are some great touches – the graphics are nice and in theory the simplification of goods routes make things more readable, as examples.

But with those more limited goods options, you have less chance to make a round-trip route that will make you sensible amounts of money. Some of this might be solved by tweaking the map generation I presume, but I might suggest the devs tweak the defaults (unless I was just unlucky in the two maps I generated?). This may be simply because my map was too small or not dense enough [update: I am now playing a hard, very large map and it has given me a lot more options. The lack of undo remains my (and others) biggest cause of frustration in combination with the costs that choose a ""wrong"" track path incurs)

But it’s the UI issues that persist that mean I’m really disappointed and make me think you might simply be better served in buying the first game if you have neither. A lot of these might be quality of life issues, but with modern games now you’d expect these things, and it’s hardly like they reinvented the wheel here.

If you’re wondering (and heck, you might be able to correct me if I’ve missed something) the things I’d love to have are generally related to a lack of planning / undoing options and UI.

On the former perhaps while paused the game could let me experiment then Undo anything that I can’t complete? Or give me a quick save so I can at least pause, save, then load again if I need to (although ideally just snapshot my state when I press a button if you’re going to do that route – don’t make me actually load again please). It’s really annoying to start making a track, micromanaging it as the game doesn’t really ever help you find a best route (or close to), then not being able to finish it off.

Small other bits I’d love to see addressed include:
•	A view reset button so I can keep a fixed idea of North in my head (also great when playing with a few friends on the same map, to have a common frame of reference)
•	I’d love to change the scroll speed of the cursor keys (this might be in an ini file?)
•	I would find it great to have a windowless screen with no mouse capture.
•	Alt-F4 – It does something, which is nice, but if press that, how about simply quitting?
•	Give me a circle around the depots or terminals so I can see where their reach, as maximum, can extend to. And not just have it in that white that’s so hard to read, especially if you’re in terrain mode

I will play more and I’m sure I’ll enjoy it to some extent (and I have a friends who is in love with the first game, and like with all love, this means he ignore the bad and focuses on the good 😊 ), but I just wish they’d done more with the UI – and the main thing I really would love to have is a way to do “what ifs” with building roads or tracks (including a path editing tool before committing), and that’s simply not here.",1576085279,1576154998,FALSE,15,1,0.543931782,1,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,230,11,247,0,55,1576623403

The problem with this theory is that it showed what to me, a new player, was a proper connection (the thin blue connecting line) but a real proper connection for the depot is when it shows the big drive way. This took me almost an hour to figure out. I tried several ""fixes"" before finally figuring that out on my own.

I have played the game for roughly 6 hours and have made little progress due to every time i figure one thing out i have to spend another 30 minutes to an hour figuring another thing out. I haven't been able to ""play"" at all. 

Though, it does seem like it will be super fun once I know what i'm doing.

There's no difference in pricing between cargo,  no difference in decay rate, and no difference in sensitivity to speed.  This doesn't actually make the game more simple, it makes it unintuitive and leads to weird and confusing results.

0,Transport Fever 2,59697215,english,"Man the game is awesome imo if you are into this style of games. There are clear differences between TF2 and TF1. Yes you can argue that the track laying system is kind of the same but i feel like in TF2 it is more fluid and track laying is less clunky. The modular stations are such an amazing improvement that i feel like only that feature makes this game worth buying yet no one seems to acknowledge that. The graphics are greatly improved compared to TF1. Also i feel like 90% of the people that play this game will use steam workshop, a massive part of TF1, so this game still needs time for that content to be made by the people on the workshop. The terrain tool is so much better in TF2. It could be improved ofc but it works so much better now. They also officially said they will have DLCs. Yes you can argue that u will have to pay a bit more for more features but look at how good that turned for cities skylines. The combination of massive DLCs and Incredible workshop support made that game arguably the best city building game ever. Is all that content worth the money? Imo yes but i feel like that is up to every person as we are different and have different tastes so... yea.

I see people compare this game with Railway Empire but people keep forgetting that RE even now costs 20% more, and that's not even taking into consideration the additional -10% off if you own TF1. Also RE is purely a train game and this game is so much more. Yes the track laying system could take a few points from RE building system and be improved but the game just came out so maybe in the future? Yes i know RE also has the different station line management system where the same line can select different tracks where to drop things off in the station so yea there are a few things that could be improved in this game also but again, i dont consider these things so bad that it makes the game unplayable, farm from it actually.

Also yes some ways of transport are gonna be more profitable and/or harder to manage than others. Trains will run more profitable at one point than anything else, ships are indeed kind of hard to set up in the beginning or trucks wont provide such a massive amount of income as trains but they are very easy to set up and almost instantly turn quite profitable. Arguing that one mode of transportation sucks compared to another one and from there on saying that the game is bad is like arguing that because they took the Concorde out of the sky even tho it was amazing but almost impossible to run they should ground all planes because they suck. Also yes the maintenance costs are increased but you have different difficulties also you can do sandbox where money is not an issue so complaining that things are expensive and you can't handle it when you have the option of turning that down/off is again a mistake imo like complaining that you play Resident Evil on highest difficulty and you keep dying so the game is bad... The economy in this game works differently than in TF1 so you will have a few trial and error moments before you learn the jist of things. There is also the map generator that is a bit different and i quite like with the different bioms and all.

That being said if you are into the transport tycoon type of games and you have the money for this game in strongly recommend it.

+Interesting changes to cargo and goods. I was on the fence before I played, but after interacting with them I can say I'm satisfied.

// Information
| There seems to be a reformulation on how passengers move between cities, as there seems to be less intercity travel. This absolutely could be my fault, but I am playing the same way I played TpF 1. 

| I have not played past 1950 yet, and my Transport network is not overly large yet. Because of this I cannot say how late game performs just yet.

- Game seems to be heavy on my GPU. I can have a steady 30FPS with peaks of 60FPS (VSync will not allow it to go past 60) During gameplay CPU usage on my I7 7700k is around 20-30%, whereas my 1080 is seeing 70-80% usage. This is not a problem really, as 30fps on this type of game isn't a deal breaker. Otherwise I'd turn down the settings. 


Overall I am very pleased with this game, It is definitely improved across most fronts, and no significant steps backwards in my opinion. Very happy I bought the game. :)

I will also tack on as an edit: This absolutely could NOT have been done as a DLC. The changes seem to go to the core of the game, and possibly needed to update the engine to handle the changes. People need to realize that not everything can just be tacked on to a game with the wave of a wand. Large scale changes it is easier and faster to just build from the ground up than add on to an existing system. The asking price is fair as well, as a great deal was done between TpF1 and 2.

When this game got anounced, i got to be honest, i jumped on the hype train (no pun intended). 

Right now after i played for a few houres, im kind of disapointed. The graphics got a huge improvment, with new UI design and sounds. Even the campain is finally enjoyble to play. Maybe the biggest change is the terrain and map editing tool, which has gotten a big overhaul. Is there more? No... There is no game changing features that makes you play any different from the previous game. It feels like a reskin of TF1 nothing more. 

I wish the developers would have tried venture to other transport solutions or ways to manage existing. This game is still mainly focused on trains. Passenger ships are useless, cargo ships are useless and airplanes are still very difficult to use. Coman lets improve these things and lets add new transport methods; like cruises, ferries, metro, hooverrails or even helicopter to remote places, whatever, just do something new.

Slight little lags here and there when buying vehicles or zooming the map but totally smooth and playable otherwise. 

Secondly, I do agree with some people that this is more of TF1.5 than a full blown sequal. There isnt as much change or improvement to the game play itself as I was hoping for. Having said that if you just want this game to play transport fever with better graphics and better FPS you are in luck. Thats exactly what it is. Also the map generator is FREAKIN AWESOME. I always hated how lame the maps were in TF1 and that problem is completely gone and over with. 

In conclusion, maybe just a tiny bit disapointed from what I expected from all the hype but it definately still deserves a thumbs up.

55,Transport Fever 2,59679718,english,"my favorite things about this game series were always the procedural-generated terrain (great replay value), the town-growth modeling algorithm based on supply and demand (creating a game economy with very few simple rules) and of course the trains and vehicles. there was a lot of info out there on youtbue about the game but not necessarily about the stuff i was most interested in - so for me it was right into sandbox mode 1850 on hard when game was available and i'm pleased to see it improves on all of these aspects, and more. 

here are the ten things i like so far (6 hours in):

1. the new cargo and industry mechanics - i was a little concerned about this but it's an improvment. 

 towns requiring specific goods makes for a greater challenge (good).

 raw goods such as crude or grain are processed at 2:1 ratio - making it more challenging to have trains run full both directions (but still possible through some clever routing).

2. ui got a big improvement. line-management and vehicle-management take a bit of getting used to but are very useful once you do.

3. feedback to player about town and industry is a *huge* improvement - you can now actually tell (not just guess) what the industry is doing and why.

4. overlays are cool but not too useful - except the terrain tool which is a must when laying tracks; also don't like the white color the overlays have.

5. configuring the stations is cool - and very useful when you need to connect a road just right.

6. you can look around in 1st person mode now - really cool.

7. graphics are an obvious improvement as can be seen in any youtube video.

8. performance is not. runs fairly well and very playable for me but at 30fps or less most of the time and doesn't feel smooth. (game does close much faster though - used to freeze up my pc for 10-20 secs not it takes less than a second)

9. terrain and map tools took a huge upgrade. the map generation tool will put my map making days out to pasture - it's very good.

10. i think the hard mode (sandbox) is bugged - you get 5m to start and it feels too easy.

note: my cpu quite fast bat is an older fx-8370 - so maybe with newer cpus performance is better.",1576096724,1576096724,TRUE,1,0,0.506410241,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,110,6,40179,0,501,1597225595

Running with good graphics performance and beautiful scenery - I have only played on a small map so far. No stuttering or graphics issues for me so far ( i7-7700 16GB ram  GTX1070 - 5 hours gameplay).

Previously playing Transport Fever 1 I had finally got my head around delivery frequency in the old game and worked out why factories used to shut down or reduce productivity due to over-delivery etc. But it was complex. - Working with this was way too distracting and didn't allow me to develop my maps very far as I concentrated on calculations and fluctuations in delivery yields.
Transport Fever 2 has improved on this dramatically and is much more intuitive. New information graphics now show me exactly how much I am delivering. This has also been helped enormously with the introduction of being able to stop time without pausing the game. This feature means I can get my network efficient before I have to concentrate on the introduction of updated vehicles disrupting all my previous work.  Awesome!!!!

I haven't played enough to fully experience each town only accepting two types of freight. And I must admit when I first heard about this change I did wonder why it was necessary - but in gameplay so far, the reality is that it has allowed me to focus and develop my map. As it turns out I think the old game just gave me too much choice. Another awesome addition!!!

Not played about much with the new modular stations. But I can say this has also improved the gameplay. It now allows the mix of both passenger/freight and in addition has also improved functionality by adding more entrance/exits. Plus there is the new Cargo drop-off points. So much better than using a bus stop as a cargo drop that was in TF1!!!

I sense that so much time must have been spent developing the new map generation tools and use of height maps. This is a feature that adds a huge amount gameplay and options that I am looking forward to playing with. 

So a big thumbs up from me and a hearty well done to the development teams involved!!!!

Also - the new indication of how a train will perform depending on how many wagons I add is excellent too

21,Transport Fever 2,59660438,english,"[b]Transport Fever 2[/b] is a nice update to the transport and logistics simulation genre of games, and more specificly a nice improvement on Transport Fever 1.
I have currently as of writing this review 2 hours in TF2, but I have around 110 hours in TF1.
The new UI is fresh and clean although it suffers from not being the most intuitive UI but not the worst I've used.
The graphical improvement is massive, with this though comes set backs, and one big one which I've seen from other reviews is linked to performance. Currently at 2 hours och gameplay and trying it out it runs well on my rig, but my rig is arguably more on the very high end.

Intel i7 6700k @ 4GHz
RTX 2070 16GB
16GB DDR4 RAM
Game is installed on a new 7200RPM HDD

And the game runs well for me, but you might want to be a little more cautious with an older/cheaper rig, but since it runs well for me at 50-60fps most of the time I can't complain (VSYNC on).
There are dips to about 40fps though when building certain things just like in TF1.

A lot of new vehicles, and they're so much more detailed.
Terrain tools are a lightyear ahead of the first installment of this game series.
The new modular station system and other improvement such as being able to connect a train station to a bus stop without needing to have a road in between is a great change and makes it easier to make a clean looking bigger transport hub in a city.


[b]Closing thoughts and reminders. (TL;DR)[/b]

The game is a massive improvement in various ways from TF1 and it does these improvements well including the UI, it's not the best UI but it is better than the one in TF1.
The game runs at an average 50 fps, there are dips even for me in the fps when building tracks, just like in TF1. People with older and/or cheaper rigs should try it and see how hteir performance is, because your mileage may vary.
The tools, vehicles and buildings look a lot better than in TF1.
More vehicles to choose from and a lot prettier and more detailed.

I do recommend this game for anyone interested in the transport management/simulation genre of games.
Buy it, try it, see if you like it before the 2 hours are up.
